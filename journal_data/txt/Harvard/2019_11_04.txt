Almost 15 years after the pilot first aired, people are still talking about “The Office”...extensively. So extensively that this October, “Office” stars Jenna Fischer (Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) began a new podcast, “Office Ladies,” in which they rewatch the show and give behind-the-scenes secrets as they reminisce about old times.
If it sounds too good to be true, or too extreme to be serious, check out their five-star rating after 24.7k reviews on the Apple Podcasts App, or listen to either of their one-hour episodes wherever you get your podcasts. Yes, that’s right — one hour. Every episode, Fischer and Kinsey chat about personal stories and give “fun facts” about the show as they go over notes from their favorite scenes.
While reunion events and anniversary episodes are not uncommon for shows as popular as “The Office,” the podcast outlet puts no bounds on what Fischer and Kinsey can do with their time. And so they talk, as friends do! Turns out Firscher and Kinsey became best friends while playing Pam and Angela, and the podcast hinges on their friendly banter and gives a unique perspective of “The Office” characters to the typical “Office” fanatic.
“I was getting so nervous that Angela made us turn off the microphones and put on a dance party to loosen me up,” Fischer shared. “I did; I put on Taylor Swift and I made her dance around and get out of her head!”
The show may not add much value to “The Office” experience outside of revealing the depth of this friendship between Fischer and Kinsey. But any true fan might have picked this up, along with many of the initial “fast facts” Fischer gives in the first episode, simply by watching the extensive blooper videos on The Office YouTube Channel (theofficeonnbctv), which is still posting videos, by the way.
People will take any excuse to rewatch the classic series. “The Office” was the most watched show on Netflix in 2018, and with NBC’s announcement this summer that the show will be off of Netflix by 2021, you too may need to take your last walk through memory lane this year living the glory days, now alongside Angela and Pam.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The inspiration to visit Blue Ribbon Barbecue was born about two weeks ago, when Jesse was sitting in Razor’s Barbershop in Somerville, getting the freshest of cuts from Drew, a bona fide magician with clippers. The topic of the local gastronomic scene came up in conversation, specifically the dearth of quality barbecue joints in the Boston-Cambridge area. If you’re a card-carrying carnivore, you’re probably aware of the problem, as a hankering for umami frequently goes unsatisfied in a city better known for calzones and lobster rolls. There’s Redbones in Davis Square, of course, which boasts packed dining rooms and long wait times every Friday and Saturday night, but any local will tell you that Redbones has gone downhill in the last few years. We sadly concur; the brisket is a little too dry, the baked beans a little too sweet, and the atmosphere a little too self-congratulatory, like an exclusive party where everyone is just happy to be there. Drew was aware of Redbones’ decline, and was ready with an alternative: Blue Ribbon in Arlington, just north of Cambridge. How does one get to Blue Ribbon, you may ask? Simple: Take the 77 bus north along Mass Ave almost to the end of the line. Hop out by the Stop and Shop, and there you are in slow-roasted heaven. Looking on a map, you’re probably further north than you’ve ever been in Boston, but at Blue Ribbon, you’ll feel like you’ve entered a little pocket of the Deep South.
***
Blue Ribbon first gives the impression that it’s much smaller than it looks from the outside. The vast majority of the space is taken up by a row of gargantuan, hickory-wood meat smokers visible from the dining area, essentially three stools staring bleakly into the street. Customers order from one of those menus on the wall that looks hand-written but probably isn’t, which sits below a tasteful decorative array of license plates from dozens of states, including a few hilarious vanity ones (“SEEYABYE” was a personal favorite of ours, presumably owned by a driver who took speed limits as more of a suggestion). The specials menu nudges you towards the restaurant’s roast turkey offerings, but go for more traditional fare: beef brisket and pulled pork, with rice and beans, collard greens, and spicy black-eyed corn on the side. Cornbread comes with almost every dish. Even though the meat has been smoking all day, the wait is short. Before you can finish reading through the the poster on the wall advertising pee-wee hockey, the food comes out, a heaping mountain of juicy flesh whose drippings are already dissolving the flimsy takeout container unfairly tasked with holding it.
The brisket tastes as though it were injected with all the fat and juice that was missing from Redbones’ brisket. If you can’t stomach straight animal fat, play a little game of find-the-meat with your fork to uncover the luscious fibers of beef hiding beneath the surface. The beef is more than worth it though, and dissolves in your mouth with just a hint of smokiness. The pork is hearty and glistens with fat, leaving behind the sliminess that haunts pulled pork at places like Redbones. This barbecue is hard-core. It tastes like it should be eaten with the windows rolled down, the rock n’ roll cranked up to 11, and the sheriff on your tail for breaking the local law against being a badass. As is the mark of any reputable barbecue joint, the sides are also excellent, but the black-eyed corn sends you straight to the water cooler. This corn is like a psychological thriller — on first glance, unassuming, without any visible pepper, it hits you with a mouth-numbing surge of spice. With the meat and sides eaten, all that’s left is a murky juice from the beef and greens. Once the hefty slice of cornbread absorbs the juices, however, you’re left with a moist, sweet slice that is a perfect capstone to the meal. Shaking off the encroaching fat coma, you thank the cheery meatmen behind the counter, head back to the bus stop, and hop back on the 77 back to Cambridge. The Deep North has done its job.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hadn’t even been able to grab a Tuesday’s edition of The Crimson to read the details before it started. Before I even had a chance to sip my morning coffee, University administrators began their virtue-signaling, excuses, statements of the obvious, and pleas of innocence. University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana emailed students in an attempt to quell the justified flames they foresaw igniting — emails, absolutely teeming with truly reassuring conviction like “We must do better.”
… Really? This empty rhetoric, I feel, underscores an essential issue with the way in which the University administration deals with sexual assault and misconduct. Administrators can either try to shine as favorable a light on the University as possible or deal with these problems as they exist. But they can’t have both.
Sending out multiple emails, before anyone could have truly internalized or made sense of the extensive results of the Association of American Universities Survey, is clearly an attempt at ass-covering crowd control.. Dedicating paragraphs of text explaining everything the University has done since the 2015 survey to combat sexual assault is a testament to this. Although these actions were a necessary step in the right direction, in the context of the data that was just released, they represent a massive failure on behalf of the University that not nearly enough has been done. They do not warrant any praise or sympathy being given to the University for that reason.
Praise can be given to all the individuals at the Title IX Office, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and all the other resources for their efforts thus far with the resources that have been made available to them. Sympathy can be given to all the many victims of sexual assault and misconduct on Harvard’s campus. But the president and the rest of the administration will earn those rights after there is improvement — and most certainly no further regression — in reports of sexual misconduct on campus.
And they certainly will not get any closer to earning those rights by immediately trying so hard to convince everyone that the University has taken significant action since 2015 when the evidence suggests that their actions haven’t been nearly enough.
It’s oxymoronic. Either there is significant action that was taken since 2015, or there persists a problem at our school and in its culture around sexual assault. If the problem persists to the same exact extent it did before then the action taken was simply not “significant” at all. There have been four years since the first survey. That’s four years’ worth of thousands of students, staff, and faculty being at risk of and experiencing sexual assault. It’s also four years of the administration telling members of the community about all the significant changes they are making to address it. And what is there to show for it? No significant improvement in the lived experience of the members of the community, at best, and a deterioration by some measures, at worse.
Bacow’s “we must do better” assertion is a baby step in the right direction that has already been made time and time again. I implore the University to stop trying to convince anyone that they have taken significant action until there is any evidence to suggest that is the case. Until Harvard is a leader among higher learning institutions in terms of sexual assault reduction and prevention, I would hope that they would hear the suggestions that have been made already and will be made to them in the coming period of time. Furthermore, I hope they take the suggestions and run with them, with all the gusto and support it will take to make a meaningful change.
The administration can’t have it both ways — it’s either they are covering up for themselves and simply acknowledging the problem exists or accepting that the problem exists as a result of their inaction and taking genuine action to establish Harvard as the global leader it professes to be.

Over 300 Harvard Law School students signed a recent public letter addressed to Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 calling on him to re-institute longer hours at campus cafes, alongside other concerns. The letter also advocates for the alleviation of what it characterizes as chronic understaffing at those locations. In pursuit of these goals, the letter demands eight changes to accommodate students and relieve staff. These include returning to the former schedule, prioritizing eight-hour shifts instead of “split shifts,” and ensuring that dining hall staff are given at least a seven-day notice of their schedule.
We appreciate students who are committed to guaranteeing that everyone at Harvard be treated fairly. That includes dining hall workers who should not be subject to unfair labor practices. Law students should be commended for standing up for the labor rights of dining hall staff. More broadly, we think the activism on this issue can serve as a starting point for broader-based solidarity in our community. We are particularly hopeful on this point given that the letter, organized by the Law School’s Labor and Employment Action Project, was motivated in part by conversations between students and dining hall workers about the working conditions imposed on them.
It is this willingness to hear each others’ stories that is the bedrock for productive activism. Harvard affiliates who are not involved in budget-saving decisions at the University are often those whose work environments are made the most difficult by those decisions, as appears to be the case with the Law School dining hall workers. The best way to combat this marginalization in budgeting is for the marginalized to continue to articulate the real human costs that budget-cutting measures have, not just for them, but for others in similar positions across the University. This is just what LEAP’s letter has done, and it is an encouraging sign for the possibility of greater awareness and co-operation to secure better labor standards for Harvard’s workers.
This action should inspire others across the University to care about labor rights — especially those of the dining hall staff — on campus. We previously called on Harvard to index graduate student stipends to the cost of living in the greater Boston area, believing that failure to do so left graduate students on the hook for uncertainty in regards to inflation in housing and childcare costs. Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers must recognize the basic commonality between these two experiences, and should therefore follow their peers at the Law School in standing up for dining hall staff. Advocating for one does not take attention away from the other, or the host of concessions graduate students are seeking. In fact, the common thread between the two — that those left out of budgeting decisions get left behind by them — can advance both causes at once. To that end, the union should work to find ways of pursuing mutually beneficial change with the law students and dining hall workers.
This letter is an important first step towards a greater awareness amongst Harvard students for labor rights on our campus. We hope that increased cooperation going forward can provide for better treatment on behalf of the thousands of people — dining hall workers, custodial services, graduate students, and more — who make our University work every day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor’s Note: 
The Crimson Editorial Board seeks to provide a platform for multiple and diverse perspectives on issues affecting Harvard. The Board is a diverse group of editors who strive to critically evaluate our past opinions and opine on topics for our readership to consider. In the spirit of open debate and expression — as well as providing a forum in The Crimson’s opinion pages where all perspectives are welcome — we are publishing this column. 
— Jessenia N. Class ’20, Editorial Chair
— Robert Miranda ’20, Editorial Chair 
— Kristine E. Guillaume ’20, President 
My first Crimson staff editorial meeting as an active editor was in December 2016. I had gone through the semester-long comp process, which included submitting and editing my eight pieces to join the Editorial Board. In joining The Crimson, I saw the opportunity to share my voice through a medium that would allow me to write op-eds and learn how to defend my opinions. And of course, as many other freshmen, I wanted to make new friends.
But for that first meeting, my identity and safety were on the docket. On that day, I learned that the majority of the people present were not in my corner and would not be my friends.
Exactly one month after the 2016 presidential election that shook the entire undocumented community, the Editorial Board was opining on former University President Drew G. Faust’s decision to not declare Harvard a sanctuary campus — a campaign I had been working on with fellow undocumented students and allies amidst the sleepless nights full of anxiety and fear.
Earlier that month, undocumented students from across the University pled our case during a meeting with Faust. In my view, Faust turned her back on us when she did not decide to make Harvard a sanctuary campus, undermining our fears and patronizingly claiming she knew what was best for us.
That night in The Crimson, the room also failed to show up for undocumented students.
Some comments on the matter seemed hopeful. Then more comments against my opinion — against me — started joining the conversation, each new voice erasing the very real challenges my community was facing.
I finally interjected, feeling forced to share my immigration status with a room full of strangers. My comment came across shakily as I was one of the newest members, but I felt a duty to contribute to this conversation in a room full of students who, for the most part, had the privilege of being able to view this issue “objectively.” They had no stake in the matter, but also had no qualms when it came to speaking over my lived experiences.
But the conversation continued downhill, and the attacks against my opinion felt personal as I was the only undocumented person in the room. It was clear who was against me as hands went up in the vote for the final pitch. Their faces carried no remorse as their votes supported a pitch devaluing the efforts of the sanctuary push.
I continued with The Crimson, hoping I could bring some change to it. I penned a dissent with two other Crimson editors on this very issue. I wanted to see the dissents become majority opinion and, to some extent, they did. I saw the Board grow more liberal throughout the years, though I’ve also seen some of the radical voices driven away once they experience actual meetings like the first one I had witnessed.
The power dynamics of the organization are clearly seen in Editorial Board meetings. At every meeting, the more center voices take their places at the center table and back of the room, comfortable in their black chairs. The more liberal voices concentrate around the outer table, where we sit cross-legged and uncomfortable in more ways than physically. The people at this “counter,” as we were once labeled during a meeting, consists of most of people of color and queer members of the Board. We’ve held our ground for so long, winning some battles along the way, but the environment of the building has become more and more toxic.
I stopped going to meetings this semester as I put my energy into things that matter most to me. I kept my column going because it was my individual work, but I am quitting completely now due to The Crimson’s reminder to me that it does not support undocumented students on this campus by undermining the fears that come with requesting comment from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement — just like the Editorial Board undermined mine the day they decided we did not need a sanctuary campus.
The Crimson hides behind its claim of “unbiased” journalism to justify its decision to request comment from ICE, the U.S. deportation machine, for comment on a matter that doesn’t affect those in leadership. The power dynamic shows through again as leadership clings to objectivity and transparency, losing valuable editors and straining relationships with undocumented students and affinity groups.
The Crimson cannot continue to hide from the many things wrong with the organization. Objectivity is patronizing in inferring people can be objective at all. While the organization is separate from Harvard, it is clear this is the population they are meant to serve. Instead of conforming to oppressive journalistic norms, The Crimson should be more concerned with its relationships on campus.
I’ll be surprised if this piece gets published. But even if it doesn’t, I’ll find another medium to share it. Either way, I end this piece by announcing my last day as a Crimson editor. The Crimson has made it clear that it is not and has never been worthy of my time and labor.

To the Editor,
In response to The Crimson’s staff editorial, “Still Waiting for Nuance” (October 9), I wish to clarify Harvard's unrecognized single-gender social organizations policy and our procedures for enforcing it.
The policy applies to organizations that are single-gender; and that have a primarily social mission; and that are formally organized (with by-laws and a governing structure); and that are primarily composed of Harvard students. As we have publicly stated before, the policy does not apply to organizations that are either recognized by Harvard College or chartered at Harvard College or any other higher education institution.
As the policy states, a student who belongs to a USGSO is not eligible for certain leadership positions or fellowship support. Therefore, if a student is found to be in a USGSO while also holding a leadership position in a recognized organization or serving as a team captain, or while under consideration for a fellowship, the student will need to give up the leadership position or fellowship support. The College’s usual processes concerning candor with Harvard administrators apply in this area as in all other areas of student life. Therefore, if a student is found to be lying to an administrator or to be misrepresenting membership status to the College, that student will be subject to standard disciplinary proceedings as currently described in the Harvard College Handbook for Students. Policy violations relating to social misconduct and misrepresentation of membership status are reviewed by the administrative board.
The USGSO policy allows Harvard to dedicate its resources, including the use of the Harvard name, to those students and organizations that are advancing our commitment to non-discrimination, and also allows our students to make informed choices about their experiences while at Harvard.

Leverett House resident tutors have begun designing and developing a new recreation room — which will include arcade games and lounge areas — for the House’s residents.
Robert Roessler and Raymond S. Deluca, tutors in Leverett, put together a proposal for a new recreation room over the summer at the request of Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras. The faculty deans submitted their plan in September and the College has set aside funding for the space, according to Roessler and Deluca.
Since Leverett residents are split up among several disconnected buildings, Roessler and Deluca wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that they wanted to create a space to bring residents together. They wrote that they believe that the Leverett Towers should be a priority because some of the buildings’ common spaces are “chronically underused.”
“Leverett, being the biggest House on campus — split between several large buildings — has specific challenges in the distribution and utilization of spaces,” they wrote. “This issue is made more acute in the Towers, where physical layouts have left some great spaces underutilized.”
Roessler and Deluca have sent out a spreadsheet and a poll to Leverett residents to gather ideas for recreation room amenities. The tutors wrote that they expect the room to include a few arcade machines, board games, video game consoles, and a dartboard, as well as a coffee table and a sofa. They also wrote that the game room would be located in F Tower, in a common room called F Hutch.
Jessica Tsang ’20, a Leverett House resident, said she thinks a new gathering space is much-needed because it can be difficult to book existing rooms.
“The space is really being used for nothing right now, so it would be beneficial,” Tsang said. “I think it would be nice for a lot of people to have that extra space to hang out just because it has been a little tougher for groups of people to get spaces here now.”
The plan for a new recreation room comes amid Leverett residents’ concerns about the frequent closure of other common spaces and the infrequency of House social events under Farrell and Ferreras. Students listed grievances in a shared Google Doc in September and discussed plans with House management.
Farrell and Ferreras wrote in an email Saturday that they are “very excited” about the prospect of the game room as a new recreation space for Leverett. Delaney O. Hurley ’22, who lives in Leverett, said she appreciates the efforts of the House administration to involve students in the process of creating the game room.
“I think it is a good sign that they are trying to incorporate student ideas into a space that is specifically designed for us,” Hurley said.
Roessler and Deluca wrote they hope students will meet and interact with each other in the new space.
“The goal is for the game room to become a vibrant place for students, tutors, and deans to gather for recreation and in-house events,” they wrote. “We want this to be a space where students who wouldn’t otherwise cross paths meet and get to know one another.”

Several Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors will lead a discussion on divesting Harvard’s endowment from fossil fuel companies at the monthly Faculty meeting Tuesday.
History professor Joyce E. Chaplin, Economics professor Stephen A. Marglin, and Astronomy professor Charles Conroy will address whether Harvard’s response to climate change should include divestment from “fossil fuel interests,” according to the meeting agenda. University President Lawrence S. Bacow agreed in April to host such a discussion at a future faculty meeting after multiple professors demanded he do so.
The discussion comes as student and alumni activists have maintained pressure on Bacow to reconsider the longstanding position of University presidents not to divest from Harvard’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry. More than 380 faculty members have also signed a petition calling on Harvard to divest from fossil fuels.
Bacow has offered multiple rationales for continued investment, including that Harvard should work with industry players to address climate change.
At last month’s faculty meeting, three professors broached the issue of climate change in preparation for the November forum — though Bacow was not in attendance.
The faculty members drew at times on their own academic work to share information about the history and scope of the issue. At the meeting, Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall called on Harvard to demonstrate “true leadership” to the public, garnering thunderous applause from faculty.
The Faculty will discuss tweaks to existing legislation on course scheduling at Tuesday’s meeting. The Faculty Council — FAS’s highest governing body — voted earlier this month to approve the changes, which include attempts to evenly distribute courses throughout the week.
FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke, who brought the proposed changes before the Council earlier this month, will present the proposal to the full faculty Tuesday.
Under the proposed changes, faculty members no longer need administrative approval to begin seminars at 9:45 a.m. or 12:45 p.m., instead of the typical designated start times for classes of 9 a.m. or 12 p.m..
Burke will also propose a change that mandates departments distribute courses that meet once per week evenly throughout the week. Previously, FAS only required classes meeting at least four times per week to conform to such restrictions.

More than 400 people gathered to listen to German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier discuss technology ethics at a Harvard Law School event Friday morning.
Hosted by Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, the event — entitled “Ethics of Digital Transformation” — also featured professors studying in a variety of disciplines from both American and German universities.
Steinmeier, speaking in German, kicked off the panel discussion by pointing out the prevalence of technology in today’s society.
“The question that stands in the foreground is not ‘Do we need this technology?’” Steinmeier said. “No one denies the great chances and the great opportunities that we have in the fight against poverty, the handling of climate issues, the fight against sickness.”
From Steinmeier’s points about societal change and the future of democracy in relation to technology, the panelists discussed the benefits of using technology to fight global problems — including climate change — as well as the negative consequences.
Matthew Liao, a panelist and director for the Center of Bioethics at New York University, spoke to concerns about the use of technology in medicine. He said the integration of technology into healthcare could reduce administrative costs, facilitate drug discovery, and aid with the vision of precision medicine.
Liao highlighted “exciting developments” in this field, but also talked about data collection and privacy in medicine.
“One of the biggest challenges with machine learning is that it requires a lot of data,” Liao said. “What that means is that someone has to go out there and collect all of this data, and then you get into issues about privacy — especially in healthcare. It’s personal data that we’re talking about.”
Law School professor Crystal S. Yang discussed the use of artificial intelligence in the United States criminal justice system. She said there is a dramatic increase in the use of algorithms to determine a person’s future criminality. They are currently used by police departments across the U.S., according to Yang.
With concerns regarding the use of artificial intelligence in place of human decision-making, Yang said there are often flaws in human reasoning as well.
“While there is acknowledgement that the algorithms are often imperfect, I think it is also important to consider the relevant counterfactual,” Yang said. “There’s lots of evidence that human decision makers have a big role to play in perpetuating inequalities through bias and inconsistency.”
In the context of the debate about digital media ethics, Steinmeier said the discussion occurs almost exclusively — but separately — in scientific and philosophical circles.
“From my point of view, we have the two communities: the tech community on one side and the rather social-scientific, philosophical community on the other side,” Steinmeier said. “We have, from my impression, a disconnect between the two sides.”
The panelists also agreed that the discussion surrounding the ethics of technological developments is one requiring the involvement of experts from across fields of study.
Melissa Nobles, dean of the school of humanities, arts, and social sciences at MIT, said there is a need for conversations across disciplines.
“We recognize there has to be a bridge between technology and the social sciences,” Nobles said. “They are not going to be easy conversations to have. As much as we try to be collaborative, we’ve really had to work.”

Director of the Peace Corps Jody Olsen and Barbara Stewart, chief executive officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service said at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Friday that increasing Americans’ awareness of service opportunities is critical to expanding public service.
Moderated by Mark D. Gearan ’78, a former director of the Peace Corps and the current director of the Institute of Politics, Stewart and Olsen each spoke about how they began their journey in service. Stewart credited her mother for instilling in her the inspiration to volunteer. Olsen’s journey began later in her life, when she heard about the Peace Corps during her junior year of college.
Stewart said that 75,000 Americans serve in AmeriCorps, a voluntary civil society program under the CNCS, each year, and approximately 77 million Americans volunteer within their communities. Still, both Olsen and Stewart acknowledged that there is room for more service.
The duo also discussed how the benefits of participating in service are often underestimated. Stewart cited advantages such as gaining practical skills that employers seek, as well as developing personal growth and rediscovery of service members’ identities.
Stewart also discussed the impact public service participation would have on stitching current political divisions in the country.
“More Americans would have the opportunity to work with each other. People from different backgrounds would have the chance to interact with one another, to get to know someone from a different part of the country, from a different religion, from a different socio-economic background. All huge benefits of service,” she said.
Olsen also referred to the specific impact that colleges like Harvard can have on spreading the ideals of public service.
“I think that it is so important for universities, colleges — Harvard, which is, as usual, setting up a first step for a lot of other universities to follow — … to really say, strongly, the importance of service and to provide the space as part of the curricula to serve,” Olsen said.
Brinkley L. Brown ’21, a member of the JFK Jr. Forum Committee who attended the event, said that the talk affected her thoughts on pursuing public service in the future.
“I’m a junior and I’m thinking about post-college plans, and I know for sure that I’m definitely not going to more school immediately after graduating. And Peace Corps and public service is definitely something that I’m heavily considering and this only reaffirmed that belief,” she said.
Esteban Morales Herrera, a member of the Kennedy School’s Emerging Leaders program who also attended the event, noted that expanding public service can have a positive impact on the world.
“I think it could be a really good impact because all of us are young and we have the desire to change the world. And we have always that question: ‘What do we want to make to make a better world?’ And we have these kinds of specific realities,” Herrera said.

As Cambridge residents prepare to head to the polls Tuesday, their 22 options for Cambridge City Council represent a wide range of perspectives on several hot-button local issues, including affordable housing, environmentalism, and whether they should accept donations from real estate developers.
Ahead of the election, The Crimson surveyed this year’s slate on their personal backgrounds and policy positions. Nineteen candidates responded to the survey; incumbent City Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui and challengers Ben T. Simon and Charles J. Franklin did not submit responses.
Most candidates have deep roots in Cambridge, with nearly 70 percent of respondents saying they have lived in the city for more than 20 years. Their ages are more disparate: The youngest candidate in the running — Burham Azeem — is 22 years old, while the oldest — John Pitkin — is 75 years old.
While Cambridge does not list partisan affiliation on its ballots, the candidates are largely clustered on the left. Of those who answered the survey, more than 56 percent identified as “liberal,” more than 31 percent described themselves as “very liberal,” and only 12.5 percent — Gregg J. Moree and Jeffery A. McNary — called themselves “moderate.” Challengers Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and Derek A. Kopon did not share their political leaning.
Over the past few months, several issues have established themselves as key concerns for residents. Chief among them are affordable housing and climate change. Nine candidates ranked affordable housing as their biggest priority, while six considered climate change their number one issue.
Five candidates ranked education as their second priority issue, though none marked it as their first.
Earlier this year, councilors introduced a 100 percent affordable housing overlay, which has been hotly debated. The zoning reform proposal seeks to incentivize developers to build affordable housing units in Cambridge by streamlining approvals processes and reducing costs.
The overlay, which the council ultimately tabled in September, represents a divisive issue across campaigns. Roughly 44 percent of candidates support its passage, around 33 percent of candidates oppose it, and 11.1 percent support it with reservations. Incumbents Quinton Y. Zondervan and Craig A. Kelley indicated that the proposal needed revisions before they could support it. Dennis J. Carlone did not indicate his stance.
Many of those who indicated opposition to the measure explained that while they support expanding affordable housing options, the overlay is missing important elements. McNary deemed it “flawed public policy.”
“It's socio-economic engineering,” he wrote. “It's Gilbert and Sullivan with a dash of Jacobin self-righteousness.”
Candidate Nicola A. Williams indicated in her response that the proposal was simply not enough to address the affordable housing crisis in Cambridge.
“We need a comprehensive housing plan and not to cede control of our neighborhoods to the ‘build, build, build’ mentality of corporate developers,” she wrote.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons, on the other hand, defended her long time support of the proposal.
“As one of the Co-Chairs of the Housing Committee, I was one of the main Councilors pushing this legislation forward,” she responded. “I believe it would be a useful tool to help the City gain some badly needed affordable units, and I am hopeful we may yet see this passed in the next Council term.”
The survey also indicated that more than 66 percent of respondents do not think city council candidates should accept campaign contributions from real estate developers or their agents. Several candidates have condemned others who accept such funds, saying it holds recipients to developers’ wishes.
Last month, Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern defended his willingness to accept campaign donations from developers.
“Who gets to decide who can contribute to campaigns and who can't?” he questioned in his survey response.
Candidate Adriane B. Musgrave took a more moderate approach, stating that though she has not accepted any donations from developers, that was not part of her platform, and she does not hold negative opinions on those who do.
Challenger Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 indicated she does not take donations from anyone who may have business before the council, adding that avoiding conflicts of interests could help “rebuild” public trust in the council.
“Developers are not evil — or even bad people,” she wrote. “However, avoiding even the appearance of any conflict of interest is something all elected officials should strive towards.”

Immigrant rights advocate Cristina Jiménez recounted her story growing up in the United States as an undocumented immigrant and becoming an activist during a Phillips Brooks House Association event honoring her Friday night.
Jiménez received the 13th annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award at First Parish Church in Cambridge for co-founding United We Dream, an advocacy group for young immigrants. The organization is among the largest youth-led immigrant advocacy groups in the country, with more than 400,000 members. United We Dream has worked to pass significant legislative protections for undocumented immigrants in the U.S., like the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Harvard Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh presented the award to Jiménez, noting that she was one of Time Magazine’s 2018 Top 100 Most Influential People and has held a MacArthur Fellowship.
In her speech, Jiménez recounted traveling from Quito, Ecuador to New York City. She described being told in high school that she could not attend college because she was undocumented. She ultimately graduated from Queens College and Baruch College. She also told the story of her younger brother being racially profiled and assaulted by a police officer.
“I share this experience and the stories of my family because they are the lived experiences of many people in this country and around the world,” Jiménez said.
She also described United We Dream’s approach to activism throughout her speech, saying that the group has sought to center undocumented individuals’ voices becuase they understand more directly the challenges immigrants face and how they might be mitigated.
Jiménez’s speech was punctuated by cheers from the crowd. She interacted with the audience throughout, leading chants like “stand up, fight back.”
She also connected the immigrant rights movement with other social justice movements, such as advocacy against climate change and police brutality.
“Our struggles are linked and so is the liberation of our communities,” she said.
She also promoted an upcoming national student walkout on Nov. 8 ahead of the Supreme Court’s scheduled hearing on DACA Nov. 12. DACA allows undocumented children brought to the U.S. by their parents to live and work in the country. She encouraged all of Harvard to take part in a scheduled campus walkout on Nov. 11.
Event attendee Jennifer Luong ’23, whose parents are Vietnamese refugees, said that Jiménez’s speech resonated with her and helped her think about her adjustment to attending Harvard.
“Finding this space where people will have stories that are really similar to mine was a nice thing to find,” she said.
Professor emeritus Robert Coles ’50, for whom the award is named, was also present at the event. Coles, a child psychiatrist, has worked with PBHA for more than half a century.
Jiménez praised Coles’s work and noted the connections between their respective social justice efforts. She ended her lecture by stating the impact of telling stories and the importance of taking action.
“We're not just about to share our stories,” Jiménez said. “Yes, their stories are powerful, but we got to take action to make those dreams a reality.”

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council endorsed three of environmental advocacy group Harvard Forward’s campaign points at its meeting Sunday.
Harvard Forward is a group seeking to elect several candidates to Harvard’s Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body — in order to address what it calls the University’s “insufficient response” to climate change, according to its website.
The first point of Harvard Forward’s platform the UC endorsed is to reserve six seats on the Board of Overseers for Harvard alumni who graduated within the last four academic years. As there are 30 alumni on the Board of Overseers, Harvard Forward demands a fifth of the seats be reserved for recent graduates.
The UC also endorsed instituting yearly town halls with the Board of Overseers open to students at all Harvard schools, and allowing the presidents of the UC and Harvard’s Graduate Council to give semesterly presentations to the Board of Overseers.
“We believe that the Harvard Board of Overseers, in making decisions that directly impact student lives, should be directly informed by those who can best speak to the realities of current student life,” the council’s statement reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the UC’s endorsement.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 sponsored the legislation to endorse Harvard Forward’s campaign.
The three points the UC endorsed fall under the Inclusive Governance and Student Voices pillar of Harvard Forward’s campaign. The council did not endorse the campaign’s other pillar — Climate Justice and Responsible Investing — which demands that the University divest its endowment from fossil fuels.
University administrators have long maintained that Harvard’s endowment not be used as a tool to enact social change. Instead, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has argued that Harvard must work with industry players to combat climate change.
The UC also allocated $3,000 to fund transportation for non-emergency visits to medical facilities other than Harvard University Health Services. Students will be able to take ride-share services like Uber and Lyft to off-campus facilities and be reimbursed $40 per round trip for a maximum of eight times per semester, according to the legislation.
Lowell House representative M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21, Adams House representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22, Mather House representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, and Leverett House representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22 sponsored the legislation because they believe off-campus healthcare should be more accessible to students, according to Larson.
“[W]e wanted students to get the care they need without worrying about the cost of getting there,” Larson wrote in a press release.
HUHS currently offers taxi vouchers for students who need to travel to other medical facilities, but the legislation calls the current system “slow and unpredictable.”
HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.
The UC also voted to publicize two surveys in its weekly email. The council will collaborate with Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice to publish the Green Orientation Survey which asks questions about sustainability education on campus. The council will also publicize a survey regarding a College-wide calendar in collaboration with the FAS Office of Communications, according to the legislation.

Harvard’s graduate student union told attendees at a town hall last Friday that a strike this semester is likely, just days after the group passed a strike authorization vote with more than 90 percent of voters in support.
Bargaining committee members said in the town hall that the strike will likely take place this semester, according to Boryana T. Hadzhiyska, a second-year graduate student in Astronomy who attended the town hall held in the Science Center Friday.
The union held consecutive town hall meetings last Thursday and Friday, the former of which was held at Longwood, Harvard’s medical campus. Organizers planned the events to bring Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers members up-to-date on the status of their contract negotiations with the University. Attendees said the events also covered recommendations to student workers on how to manage teaching and research responsibilities if a strike takes place.
“They’re mostly sure that it will happen this semester,” Hadzhiyska said, referring to the bargaining committee members who facilitated the meeting and answered questions. “Just like the timing and whether, you know, it can be organized that quickly and things like that are a concern.”
A potential strike’s exact timing, however, is still under consideration, according to Hadzhiyska and Jonas M. Hermann, another town hall attendee and a second-year graduate student in the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures.
“There’s no clear idea of when it should take place, if at all, at this point,” Hermann said.
HGSU members overwhelmingly authorized their bargaining committee to call a strike Oct. 26. The committee is now empowered to do so whenever it deems necessary.
Reading and final periods emerged as possible times for striking during town hall conversations, according to Hermann and Hadzhiyska. If a strike were to take place during those times, the primary duty graduate student teaching assistants would forego is grading.
Sandalow-Ash declined to comment on the timing or format of a possible strike.
Hermann and Hadzhiyska also said the bargaining committee discussed what a possible strike might entail for student workers.
Hermann and Hadzhiyska said one town hall attendee raised concerns about responsibilities like growing cultures in a lab that would die if left unattended.
Hermann and Hadzhiyska both said union leaders said that in the event of a strike, research assistants who join the strike should only continue research that contributes to their own academic program.
“I remember that one of the responses was that, you know, a lab should probably be sustained such that, like, it at least doesn't get disrupted,” Hadzhiyska said. “But for example, withholding the analysis of the lab results, results and stuff like that, which can be postponed and can be delayed, that kind of work is expected to be withheld during the strike.”
The events were advertised as open to all students but “closed to the press” in an email the bargaining committee sent to members Oct. 29. Members of The Crimson were asked to leave both meetings, despite both members being students and agreeing to respect the meetings’ off-the-record status.
Union bargaining committee member Justin Bloesch said when requesting the Crimson members leave the meetings that the union would not be able to be “frank” with its members with them in attendance.
Bloesch also stated that the events were only open to union members and those thinking of striking. The union, however, did not advertise this ahead of the meetings and did not appear to verify the union status of other attendees.
“These Town Halls were closed to the press because we wanted to give student workers a chance to ask questions without worrying that their questions or comments would appear in print,” Sandalow-Ash wrote in an emailed statement Sunday evening.

Parents, siblings, and extended family members of the Class of 2023 flocked to Cambridge on Friday and Saturday for the College’s First-Year Family Weekend.
Organized annually by the Dean of Students Office, the weekend consists of activities for freshmen and their relatives, including classroom visits, museum open houses, campus tours, and meals in Annenberg Hall — the freshman dining hall.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana opened the weekend at its official kick-off event in Sanders Theatre with welcoming remarks, noting that more than 2,000 family members had registered for this year’s slate of weekend activities.
In addition, this year’s family weekend coincided with the inaugural Harvard Athletics Fall Fest — a tailgate for the Harvard football game against Dartmouth featuring live music and yard games like cornhole. Parents proudly donning “P’23” caps and Harvard sweatshirts crowded into Harvard Stadium to watch the game after the event.
Loredana Marculescu, mother of Mihaela L. Marculescu ’23, said she flew in from Romania for the weekend. She said the Fall Fest was one of her favorite events.
“I found the Harvard Athletics Fall Fest very fun and interesting,” Loredana Marculescu said. “It was the first American football match I have ever attended, and I was instantly drawn to the energy it radiated.”
Several freshmen chose to spend the weekend off-campus exploring the Boston-Cambridge area and other neighborhoods in the region.
Helen S. Cho ’23 said the tailgate was the only Harvard-sponsored event she attended, instead opting for more off-campus activities with her family.
“We went on a long drive through the mill-towns of the Merrimack Valley and then down through Billerica to visit industrial sites and check out the scene,” Uday R. Schultz ’23 said.
Schultz said he did not feel like much has changed regarding his relationship with his parents since leaving home for the start of the semester.
“I didn’t feel like that much had changed except for the fact that I hadn’t seen them in a few months, so I was doing a lot more catching up with them than I normally was,” he said.
The College also organized a freshman faculty dinner for students whose families were unable to make it to Cambridge for the weekend.
Isabella R. Trasolini ’23, whose family did not attend the First-Year Family Weekend, said she was able to connect with others in her class through events like the dinner and spending time with friends whose families came to campus.
“My friends invited me to spend time with their families,” Trasolini said.

Charles J. Franklin is placing digital equity, fair housing, and climate change preparedness at the heart of his campaign for Cambridge City Council.
An MIT graduate, software engineer in Kendall Square, and resident of Inman Square, Franklin has studied, worked, and lived in Cambridge for eight years.
According to his campaign website, Franklin’s candidacy reflects his desire to improve the city that he loves.
“Many of us want the same thing - a thriving and diverse community. I want to help bridge our gaps so we can get there together,” the website reads.
Franklin did not agree to be interviewed for this article.
Franklin said in his candidate video with Cambridge Community Television that this means making digital equity — an issue he has advocated for as a founding member of Upgrade Cambridge, a grassroots organization for municipal broadband — as one of the priority issues of his campaign.
“I first got involved with Cambridge politics with my advocacy for municipal broadband. Internet is essential for both educational and financial success,” Franklin said in the video. “Yet, many of our poor, elderly, and minorities do not have access to internet or have low quality that does not suit their needs.”
“That’s why I helped found Upgrade Cambridge. We are a group that tries and advocates to close the digital divide in Cambridge,” he added.
Franklin’s campaign site said he plans to help increase internet access by bringing municipal broadband to constituents’ homes and providing quality service regardless of ability to pay.
In the same CCTV video, Franklin also took a strong stance on housing equity.
“People who have lived in their neighborhoods their entire lives are now being priced out. We have the ability and the financial stability to solve many of these problems,” he said in his campaign video.
Franklin wrote on his campaign website that he plans to address affordability concerns by allowing for the conversion of single family homes to multi-unit buildings, requiring 20 percent inclusionary housing for buildings with five or more units, and using Cambridge-specific metrics to determine income thresholds.
He also recognized the role that zoning laws have in affordability in his CCTV statement.
“We can change our zoning laws to be more sensible as well as increase affordability directly by using our funds to build on the city’s land, which they can own and operate,” he said in the video video.
Franklin has also pointed to climate change preparedness as one of the hallmarks of his campaign.
On his website, Franklin wrote about policy ideas such as switching to 100 percent renewable energy, providing more electric vehicle charging stations, requiring new commercial buildings to be solar and green-roof ready, and designing climate infrastructure according to current and future floodplains in Cambridge.

Dennis J. Carlone, a longtime Cambridge resident and progressive candidate, is seeking re-election to his fourth term on the Cambridge City Council this week.
“My vision for the future of our city is shaped by living here, raising my family here, and working on Cambridge's most innovative architectural and urban planning projects for nearly 40 years,” Carlone wrote on his personal website.
Carlone holds a master’s degree in architecture and urban design from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and previously taught at Lesley University as an adjunct professor.
Throughout his councilor career, Carlone has focused on creating sustainability initiatives and citywide planning efforts in the face of rising housing prices. In a 2017 interview with The Crimson, he said he fears for his children’s housing security if prices continue to rise.
“My children can’t live here once they have kids unless something dramatic changes,” Carlone said at the time.
On his website, Carlone outlined two diverging visions for Cambridge’s future.
“One vision is of high tech luxury skyscrapers where only the rich can afford to live,” Carlone wrote. “The second is one where communities thrive and residents can afford to raise a family, run a small business and not be forced out of the city.”
Carlone considers himself in the second camp, having opened continuous negotiations for more affordable housing. He led the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan, a project reclaiming 40 acres of underutilized land, transforming it into a mixed-use housing development.
The project, completed in 1978, received more than one billion dollars in investments and eventually opened up new public spaces at the river’s edge around East Cambridge, including the CambridgeSide shopping mall. This project earned the American Institute of Architects Award for Excellence in Urban Design, according to Carlone’s website.
Despite these efforts, Carlone did not complete a mandatory questionnaire to participate in an affordable housing public forum hosted at the Cambridge Public Library in September. More than 15 other City Council candidates spoke at the event.
Carlone also recently voted down a controversial mixed-use development that would expand affordable housing. As of early September, Carlone’s approval rating sits below 30 percent in an Emerson College poll of registered voters in Cambridge.
Since 2014, Carlone has called on the City Council to create a citywide master plan — an overarching vision that many of Cambridge’s peer cities, including New York City and Boston, have implemented.
“Here we are in the middle of major development, major change, major traffic, lack of open space — all these issues, and we don’t even have a strategy to tie it all together,” Carlone said in the 2017 interview.
During the 2016-2017 term, Carlone chaired the Council’s Ordinance Committee, focusing on initiatives to mitigate traffic and promote bike and pedestrian safety across Cambridge. According to the city council website, he helped institute Cambridge’s plastic bag ban and the city’s Net Zero Action Plan, which aims at putting Cambridge on the path to carbon neutrality.
“My background in architecture and urban design taught me how to bring people together, how to understand all the issues and then come up with a scheme or a philosophy that addresses most, if not all, things,” Carlone said in 2017.

As candidates for federal office debate whether to shun large-dollar donations, 71-year-old Jeffery McNary, a first-time candidate for Cambridge City Council, is going even further.
He’s not taking a single donation.
“We spread the word in the same fashion as the Federalist papers, man,” McNary said.
He poked fun at the “fancy” yard signs and literature that his campaign rivals have deployed ahead of Tuesday’s election, touting the fact that he prints his own campaign materials.
At the center of McNary’s campaign is a focus on remodeling Cambridge’s housing system. His housing proposal stem from what he calls a long-held commitment to people experiencing homelessness in the city. He said he has spent a “significant” amount of time registering homeless individuals to vote, and refers to them as his “brothers and sisters.”
“I want to get people off the street — winter is coming — and into beds and into shelters,” he said.
McNary grew up in Chicago in the 1960s. He recalls watching Martin Luther King Jr. speak on television and cited the Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael as a childhood inspiration.
After attending a preparatory seminary in the hopes of entering the Roman Catholic priesthood, McNary traveled to Northern Canada to live with the Jesuits, but was never ordained.
McNary said he moved to Cambridge to study at the Harvard Extension School, and soon after made a foray into politics as a campaign worker on Michael Dukakis’s successful re-election campaign for governor of Massachusetts.
The future presidential nominee later brought on McNary as an economic development coordinator. In that position, McNary said he co-authored an executive order to establish a Minority Economic Development Commission to facilitate investments in communities of color across the state.
“I’ve worked several campaigns,” McNary said. “But working campaigns and doing the people’s business in government are two radically different things.”
“You can say anything in a campaign, but that has nothing to do with government,” he added.
For the past seven years, McNary has worked as a freelance writer in Cambridge. His work has been published in Harvard’s Transition Magazine, along with other magazine outlets.
In his campaign for city council, McNary has offered multiple proposals for addressing housing challenges in Cambridge, including modernizing the Cambridge Housing Authority and granting it oversight in the city’s homeless shelters.
McNary features photo with Harvard Philosophy Professor Cornel West features prominently on his website, and he said that West supports his candidacy. West did not respond to a request for comment.
Two of the other photos are his website were taken on the University’s campus.
For McNary, the role of a city councilor should ultimately be about using the office as a “pulpit” to address the smaller-scale, everyday problems that Cambridge residents face.
“I’m a nuts and bolts guy,” McNary said. “It’s not always the fancy stuff around climate change or repairing the rings of Saturn.”
“It’s about getting through the day-to-day,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A report commissioned by Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay found there was no evidence of “malicious intent” during an Oct. 24 interaction between Harvard police and students of color attempting to install a class art exhibition in the Harvard Yard.
The report — emailed to faculty Sunday evening — came five days after faculty members started circulating an open letter to administrators, alleging that Harvard University Police Department officers created a “gratuitous atmosphere of intimidation and mistrust” when interacting with students in the class SPANSH 126: “Performing Latinidad.” The officer was responding to a call about students setting up paper cut-outs — materials for a class art installation that day — on a construction fence outside of Houghton Library.
During the Oct. 24 incident, the HUPD officer questioned the students and asked to see their IDs, according to the report. One of the students left to notify their professor, who returned and informed the officer that the students had permission to hang up the cut-outs. After a back-and-forth between the professor, the officer, and several other Harvard officials, the students were given permission to hang the project on the fence.
A few days later, History professor Kirsten A. Weld drafted an open letter dated Oct. 29 that called on the University to respond to the incident. Her letter described the Oct. 24 events as “deeply upsetting to students and course staff” and “fully unnecessary.” Within a few days, the letter had garnered 80 faculty signatures, according to Weld.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Latinx Student Association also started a petition denouncing the Oct. 24 incident, which they alleged was one of several racist incidents in recent months. The GSAS Latinx Student Association declined to comment for this story.
Gay commissioned the report on Oct. 29, tasking Administrative Dean for Arts and Humanities Mathilda van Es and Associate Dean for Physical Resources and Planning Zachary M. Gingo with examining the events that had led up to the incident. She also notified the Office of the President.
The report does not name the students, the professor, or the course. It refers to the course head involved in the incident as the "Faculty Member." Though the faculty letter and the GSAS Latinx Student Association petition do not name the students or the professor, they identify the course as SPANSH 126.
Romance Languages and Literatures professor Lorgia García Peña is the faculty member teaching SPANSH 126, according to my.harvard. She declined to comment for this story.
The final report, which was reviewed by the Faculty Member, includes a chronology of the events that took place on Oct. 24 and disputes several of the allegations set forth in the faculty letter and the petition. The report also issues several recommendations, which Gay later endorsed.
The letter and petition alleged that a Harvard affiliate had decided to call HUPD after seeing several students of color prepare the class art installation outside Houghton.
But the report rejects this allegation. A construction manager at Houghton who is unaffiliated with the University was the first person to note the students’ activity, according to the report. The construction manager called his Harvard-affiliated project managers — not HUPD, the report states. One of the project managers contacted Harvard Operations and Security who then contacted the Houghton Building Manager to report “a possible protest or demonstration.”
The building manager then called HUPD without ever seeing the students, according to the report. Neither the race nor the ethnicity of the students were mentioned, per a transcript of the call included in the report.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that HUPD “routinely responds to these types of phone calls.”
The students involved in the incident and the responding HUPD officer gave differing accounts of their conversation about the art installation, according to the report. The students said the officer told them to take the cutouts down; the officer denied this and said he first asked the students what they were doing.
When the officer asked the students to contact Yard Operations, one student instead went to find the Faculty Member, who was nearby, according to the report.
By the time the Faculty Member arrived, the other students had taken the artwork down, the report states. Those students reported that the “hovering” presence of the officer compelled them to remove the art immediately. They later described feeling uncomfortable and said the officer “remained very close to them,” per the report.
The Faculty Member then told the officer that she had received approval from “the administration” to put up the art installation, the report states. HUPD contacted Yard Ops and discovered that the Yard Ops staffer who had been in communication with the Faculty Member had been out of the office for the past few days. Another Yard Ops staffer questioned whether or not the project had actually been approved and went to the scene.
At one point during the interaction, the Faculty Member asked why HUPD had been called.
“The Faculty Member expressed the view that the ethnic identity of the students was a factor in the police being called,” the report states.
Once the Yard Ops staffer arrived on the scene, they contacted the staffer who had originally communicated with the Faculty Member about the event. Yard Ops realized that the Faculty Member had emailed one of the staffers the previous day with details of the installation, but the staffer had not seen the email since they were out of the office.
Yard Ops eventually apologized and said the class installation could proceed.
Several of the students involved reported that the incident had upset them, according to the report.
“Students reported being upset that HUPD had been called and that HUPD believed the caller and not the students about what they were doing,” the report states. “Students said that this felt very hurtful to them.”
A similar incident had occurred in May 2018, according to the report. The Faculty Member and her students had attempted to hang a poster on a tree in the Yard, but a member of Yard Ops and a security guard approached the group — an experience some later described as “embarrassing” and “uncomfortable.”
Though the report found no evidence of malicious intent, the Faculty Member told the report’s writers that the incident still caused distress.
“This conversation is about building bridges, and that’s important,” the Faculty Member said in the report. “But we need to understand that even if the intention is not bad, actions can still be harmful.”
The report indicated that the University must improve some of its procedures and practices.
“Our standard operating procedures are not adequate to support innovative activities like this one, experimental approaches that are not surrounded by administrative infrastructure and precedent,” the report reads. “We also found that some of our standard practices do not reflect what we know is needed to create an inclusive community.”
The report suggests that the University create standard operating procedures for similar academic events and review its protocol on how operations and security personnel interact with students.
Gay wrote in her email to faculty that she accepts all of the recommendations.
“As much as I value the things we learned from this, I still wish it had never happened,” Gay wrote. “It’s clear that this was very hard on the people involved, most particularly the faculty and students in the course.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80, who is running for Cambridge City Council, has framed her campaign around what she says is her unique combination of being an outsider and having experience within city governance.
Nolan attended Harvard College and has lived in Cambridge for 25 years. The Chicago native spent several years as a corporate consultant at McKinsey and Company, before she ran two small businesses —nan environment firm and a telephone reseller. As the mother of two children who graduated from Cambridge public schools, Nolan has also served on Cambridge School Committee for 14 years.
“I can bring those skills and that experience and that effective leadership to a wider set of issues on City Council,” she said. “I think Cambridge relies sometimes too much on thinking, ‘Well, we can solve this ourselves’ instead of looking outside the city for best practice.”
Nolan has kept education at the forefront of her current campaign, calling on the council to build more schools, preschools, after school programs, and summer programs.
Nolan’s platform promotes a vision of Cambridge as a “livable, welcoming city,” calling for improved public transit by ensuring a safe network of bicycle lanes across the city. Her campaign website notes her love of cycling both around the city and across the Northeast, a hobby she said opened her eyes to the need for increased bicycle safety.
She also said she understands the issues residents face concerning affordable housing and believes Cambridge suffers from a trend of over-development rather than “smart and thoughtful” development. Her plan for the affordable housing problem involves inclusionary zoning percent increases and higher linkage fees.
“We're not really building neighborhoods. We're just putting so many more units of housing there without thinking of the attendant infrastructure, the community space, the schools, the libraries, you know, the quality of life,” Nolan said.
Nolan said she also wants to see Cambridge as a leader in reducing emissions. She hopes to work to ensure that the city uses a strict process for purchasing services.
“I think the other thing the city could do is work very closely to ensure that every single element of purchasing of city services are as environmentally responsible and sustainable as possible,” she said.
Nolan noted Harvard’s contribution to improving the city of Cambridge by commending Harvard student volunteers’ work in Cambridge schools and across the city. Nolan also praised Harvard’s decision to recommit $20 million to an affordable housing program.
Still, Nolan said she believes that there is potential for increased partnership between Harvard and the city of Cambridge. She advocated for greater involvement of leaders across Harvard’s graduate schools.
“We don’t make enough use of their intellectual horsepower,” she said. “I would love to see more of that collaboration.”

As Cambridge’s biannual City Council elections approach, Gregg J. Moree hopes the seventh time will be the charm for his candidacy.
Moree, a carpenter and life-long Cambridge resident, has run in every City Council election for the last 12 years. Last cycle, in 2017, he received 46 total votes — the second fewest of any candidate.
Moree said he is confident he can “win this election by working in a [bipartisan] way.” His campaign focuses largely on his family history and his roots in Cambridge.
“I’m carrying a torch for my family,” he said.
Moree said he wants to expand youth apprenticeship programs and provide more services for senior citizens. He also proposed city-funded sponsorships for local students to attend Harvard.
“We have lots of kids that are smart. They just don’t have the money to go to Harvard,” he said. “So maybe there’s a way we can get them into Harvard by sponsoring them. The city can sponsor kids to go to Harvard.”
Moree added that he is a strong supporter of unions, including Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, which voted overwhelmingly last week to grant its bargaining committee the power to call a strike.
“I stand with the workers of Harvard University,” Moree said.
Though he said that he wants the city “to keep a good working relationship with Harvard,” Moree added that the University does not hire enough Cambridge residents for its construction projects.
“You’ve got all those buildings at Harvard University and we didn’t get any jobs out of it,” he said. “We have no jobs. Before the permits are given out, from now on, we want jobs for our youth apprenticeship programs.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment on Moree’s criticisms. Harvard offers a workforce development initiative called the Harvard Careers in Construction Program, which gives residents in Allston, Brighton and Cambridge work experience “with the goal of securing gainful, long-term employment in the construction industry,” according to the program’s website. The University spent $1.7 billion on construction and supplies in Massachusetts during fiscal year 2017, including $140 million spent in Cambridge, according to a 2018 report.
In past campaigns, Moree has faced questions regarding encounters with law enforcement. He faced trial just weeks before election day in 2007 after being charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Moree’s ex-wife alleged he broke into their home beat her with an umbrella. At the time, he denied the allegations and was subsequently acquitted.
Moree called the allegations “false” and declined to comment further.
Despite his six previous unsuccessful bids, Moree said he remains optimistic about his chances on Tuesday.
“I feel very strongly we’re going to win this election,” he said. “I want to focus on positive stuff.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Survivor is currently the longest-running reality TV show in the United States.  Since 2000, the show has produced thrilling contests rife with shifting alliances, shocking betrayals, elusive immunity idols, and nerve-wracking Council votes.  Now six episodes into its 39th Season — dubbed Island of Idols — twenty individuals face off to win the elusive million-dollar title of Sole Survivor.
One of these contestants is Harvard alumna Kellee Kim ‘12.
A Currierite and History of Science concentrator, Kim also played on the varsity soccer team during her first year. Although her stint with the Crimson was brief, she noted how impactful that experience was for her.
“There is nothing like being on a varsity team,” Kim said. “The level of competition and the pursuit of excellence with a group of people is incredibly difficult to find once you are out of college...when I was playing, I wish I had relished that feeling more often.”
According to Kim, playing for a competitive collegiate sports team — one which took home the Ivy League title her first year — helped prepare her for the rigors of the reality show. Both Survivor and varsity soccer require high levels of strength, strategy, and perseverance.  Just as importantly, they require the ability to balance camaraderie and competition.
“[In Survivor] you have to work together and yet you're competitive at the same time,” Kim said. “Soccer had a similar tension between working collaboratively as a unit, but also being competitive in terms of playing time.”
She added that soccer’s competitive nature and complex social dynamics “helped me grapple with the same feelings on the show.”
These qualities of Kim were quickly apparent to those on the show, including former Survivor winner and mentor ‘Boston’ Rob Mariano. Kim was the first contestant this season to win a Mentor Challenge, where she earned an immunity idol advantage after correctly answering a memory challenge given by Mariano and fellow mentor Sandra Diaz-Twine.
“Kellee went to Harvard, so she's pretty smart,” Mariano said in that episode. “She was pretty analytical from the second she walked into Island of the Idols. She definitely possesses skills that are needed in this game to win, and her tribemates will make a mistake by underestimating her.”
Kim, who also served as a house representative and talent show host during her undergraduate years, appears in many ways to be an unlikely competitor on the show. She had never even seen Survivor until three years ago and did not enjoy reality television prior to that time. 
But after realizing how the show mirrors society and the working world in many ways, she was instantly captivated.
“The show has been on for 19 years now and it has evolved in every way: the game play, the level of play, the types of people, the diversity of individuals, the ethical frameworks within the society, the acceptable behavior in Survivor society, and the roles of the individuals in these communities,” Kim said. “On a macro level, these changes reflect what has been happening in society, and this fascinates me.”
After seven months of avid watching, Kim decided to apply for a spot on the show.
“Survivor has always espoused the idea that anyone can do this, and I figured they might need an extra last-minute person to be on the show,” Kim said.
By the time she received a callback, she was still studying at Wharton but held out for just enough time to complete her degree. After graduation, she flew to Los Angeles to do a series of interviews and psych tests. Survivor looks for candidates who are talented storytellers, so Kim made sure to be interesting and engaging.
“The players narrate the story so it's really essential for the show to cast people who can explain what's going on in the game in a compelling way,” Kim explained.
Once she secured her slot, Kim prepared for the game by making a list of goals, such as “make the merge, find an idol, win individual immunity, have an impact, transform the game, and be memorable.”
Although only a select few at this point know how the rest of the season transpired, Kim emphasized that much like her athletic career, the journey of this competitive endeavor was equally as important as the end result.
Her favorite part of her Survivor experience? The strategy, stating that “I really loved thinking about the game.”
But while the mental aspect of the game came naturally to Kim, life in the wilderness could be challenging.  The mosquito bites were especially rough. One morning, she received 50 bites in the span of a few hours.
“I was horrified,” she recalled.
On the bright side, the bites disappeared quickly and by in-large, the positive aspects of the competition far outweighed the tougher parts.
Kim currently lives in Los Angeles, which she notes seems “like a complete cliché after filming a reality television show”. She has returned back to her job recruiting for the Lincoln Property Company and is excited to venture into the business world and make her mark in real estate.
Survivor airs on Wednesdays at 8pm on CBS, as Kim continues to fight for the title of Sole Survivor.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The Harvard women’s hockey team defeated Yale 5-2 this Saturday, maintaining an undefeated record and handing the Bulldogs their first loss of the season. Crimson head coach Katey Stone currently boasts a 21-1-3 record in regular season home games against Yale since 1994.
Harvard (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) took an early lead against Yale (3-1, 1-1 Ivy). Just 2:29 into the game, freshman Courtney Highland redirected Captain Ali Peper’s shot to score her first career goal.
“I found myself in front of the net,” Hyland said. “Ali Peper took a great shot from the point and I was able to get a stick on it in front and it tipped back in the net. It was an awesome experience having my first goal in a Harvard jersey.”
The Crimson went into the game hoping to build off its success in previous games.
“We really liked how we played against Brown,” junior Becca Gilmore said. “So [today we focused on] keeping the momentum and scoring more goals.”
Harvard succeeded in pairing accurate passing with strong stickhandling to maintain momentum during lengthy possessions. The Crimson dominated in the first period, outshooting Yale 12-5, though the Bulldogs turned the tide and ended up outshooting Harvard 30-27 by the end of the game.
Crimson goaltender sophomore Lindsay Reed recorded 28 saves, including an impressive glove snag in the third period. Becca Gilmore scored twice for Harvard, each goal assisted by Captain Kat Hughes. The first goal came on a breakaway at 0:55 in the second period.
“Throughout the past two games Kat Hughes, [Anne] Bloomer and I have been building a lot of chemistry and Kat was able to feed me the puck on the ice,” Gilmore said. “I had a one-on-zero with the goalie so it was a pretty great feed by Kat.”
Just fifty-five seconds later, junior Kate Glover netted a slapshot from the point to give the Crimson a 3-0 lead. She was assisted by Courtney Hyland and junior Brooke Jovanovich.
However, Yale battled back when sophomore Claire Dalton scored on a top shelf shot 6:33 into the second period. The Bulldogs followed with a power play goal by junior Rebecca Foggia just two minutes later. Foggia controlled her own deflection and snuck past Reid to tighten the score to 3-2. Yale didn’t score again for the rest of the game. The Crimson retook control of the game by converting four power plays into two goals.
“We were working on the power play a lot this week,” Gilmore said. “When you have a man down it’s kind of a great time to capitalize.”
Harvard’s first power play goal came 15:49 into the second, when sophomore Kyra Willoughby lit the lamp again with a wrister from the high slot, shooting the puck directly over the goalie’s head. The second came on a 5-3 power play with 11:42 remaining in the game, when Gilmore netted a one timer top shelf off a pass by Hughes, arcing the puck from the left goalpost to the upper right corner of the net. It was Gilmore’s second score of the day.
“It was a beautiful pass again by Kat Hughes,” Gilmore said.
Teamwork played a big role in the Crimson’s victory, with ten different players earning goals or assists.
“We put a big emphasis on getting pucks in the net and not being too fancy but also attacking on two on ones and just creating space for an open person,” Gilmore said.
Hyland also cited “strong leadership from the upperclassmen” in contributing to the win.
“We’re just trying to get stronger and stronger and keep improving and keep winning each game,” Hyland said.
Harvard is looking to stay undefeated when it hits the road next weekend to face Princeton and Quinnipiac.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard women’s soccer, propelled by two early goals, defeated Dartmouth 2-0 on a chilly Saturday afternoon. But the league’s other fixtures did not go the Crimson’s way on Saturday, as the combination of Yale’s loss at Columbia and Brown’s controversial win over Penn in the dying moments of double-overtime allowed the Bears to clinch the Ivy League championship on the season’s second-to-last weekend.
Harvard (12-3, 5-1 Ivy) pounced early, scoring on its first shot to jump out to what proved to be an insurmountable lead. In the game’s third minute, sophomore midfielder Sophie Hirst found an open Gabby DelPico 25 yards from the goal. The quick-footed freshman forward took a touch and fired over Brown’s junior goalie Mariel Gordon, who appeared surprised by DelPico’s quick release. It was the Brockton, Mass. native’s third league goal and her seventh overall.
Four minutes later, the Crimson made it 2-0. DelPico found an open Meg Tveit on the left wing, and the senior midfielder quickly slotted the ball in to freshman forward Angela Caloia in the box. Caloia held off a defender with her back to goal before creating an inch of space and firing past Gordon into the top right corner. It was a tidy finish to an incisive team move by the Italian U19 National Team forward, who picked up her second league goal.
“We’ve been working on crossing and kind of getting that front post run, and usually it’s a decoy, but this time Meg had a beautiful ball in and it was just a turn and finish,” Caloia said. “Honestly I don’t really remember [my thought process] but it felt really good and I think the second goal really shifted the momentum.”
Tveit, who had not started since a September 8 victory over Northwestern, had a lot of success on that left flank in the first half as she was often left wide open by a Dartmouth defense that appeared to prioritize shutting down attacks up the middle of the field.
“I think just taking that space, keeping that width is really important for us, so there was a lot of space and it was a fun time,” Tveit said. “I haven’t played a lot, so being able to go out there and play for my team was important.”
Once Harvard was up 2-0, it seemed unlikely that the Big Green (9-6-1, 0-5-1) would be able to get back into the game. But while Dartmouth was unable to add to its paltry total of three league goals on Saturday, the Big Green did begin to control the game after Harvard’s early onslaught, showing off the attacking potential that led to 29 goals in 10 non-conference games.
“They didn’t really have any breakaways, they didn’t really have any clear-cut chances,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “They had a lot of really good half-chances at our defense that [senior goalie] Kat [Hess] made some nice saves on. I’m just so proud of the way the team was able to defend, although it looked hairy at times. But that’s who we are, and we have to be ok with that.”
After the Crimson took five of the game’s first six shots, Dartmouth outshot the Crimson 12-4 in the game’s final 75 minutes and 7-1 in the second half. Freshman forward Allie Winstanley, in particular, looked threatening, cutting in dangerously and blazing shots high and wide on two separate occasions. But Winstanley, who scored nine goals in 10 non-conference games, remained scoreless in Ivy League play, making it six games and 19 shots without a league goal.
In the second half, Harvard’s tendency to play the ball out from the back nearly cost it. Crimson defenders were caught on the ball a handful of times and played a few dangerous passes that led to Dartmouth chances. But the defense largely shut down the Big Green, and Hess did the rest, earning Harvard its fourth clean sheet in six league games.
“I think as Dartmouth pushed on a little bit more we had to play quicker through those times,” Hamblin said. “There were certainly times we could have done a little better, certainly times we could have skipped it, but I think we kept the ball well enough to keep them at bay.”
The Big Green remain winless in Ivy League play this season, and this was yet another in a series of close defeats for Dartmouth, which has conceded just 10 goals in six league games and has not lost by more than two goals.
“Their record in Ivy League play is not fair because they’ve lost to Princeton in overtime, they’ve lost by a goal to Brown,” Hamblin said. “They’ve really been a really competitive group and they’ve just been missing that final punch. I’m glad they didn’t find that rhythm today, but I’ve got a ton of respect for them.”
While the game was not the walk in the park it seemed set to be early on, the Crimson held serve on Saturday, keeping it in the hunt for a league title until later in the evening. But Yale (11-4, 4-2) lost to Columbia and Brown (13-1-1, 6-0) then edged Penn with a penalty kick with 30 seconds left in the second and final overtime, rendering the final games of the season moot. The referee’s decision to award a penalty kick for a handball was vigorously appealed by Penn’s sideline, to no avail.
Had Yale defeated Columbia, a Bulldogs victory over Brown and a Harvard defeat of Columbia would have created a three-team tie for first and given the Crimson a chance to win on a tiebreak. With Yale’s loss, a Brown loss and Harvard win will create a two-team tie atop the league standings, with the Bears holding the tiebreaker thanks to their win over the Crimson earlier this season.
While the stakes are not quite what they might have been, Harvard will face Columbia (9-3-3, 3-1-2) next Saturday in the hopes of posting its best Ivy League finish since 2016.
