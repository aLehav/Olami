After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: July 20, 2012, at 11:25 a.m.
An impostor made thousands of dollars worth of international phone calls from a Harvard student’s account after obtaining the undergraduate’s personal information by pretending to be a Harvard financial aid officer, according to Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue.
In an email to 4,800 undergraduates who have applied for 2012-13 financial aid and 3,600 parents, the Financial Aid Office said that the man called a student and asked for his mother’s maiden name and the last four digits of his social security number. He claimed that he needed the information in order to process the student’s request for grant aid or loans.
He then used the information to change the password on a non-Harvard account owned by the student, according to Donahue.
Donahue said that when the student’s family found out about the phone call from the supposed aid officer, they became concerned and called the number back.
They reached a voice mail message for the Office of Admissions, but after calling again they discovered that the number had been disconnected and was only playing a Verizon support message.
The Financial Aid Office stated that the individual does not represent Harvard and cautioned students not to give out any private information over the telephone. The message also advised any student who receives a suspicious call to contact the Financial Aid Office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With longtime City Manager Robert W. Healy’s contract due to expire in June 2013, the Cambridge City Council has begun the search for his replacement.
Though the Council has yet to delineate a clear strategy for the selection process, councillors have a variety of criteria in mind as they attempt to make what will likely be Cambridge city government’s most important decision this year.
In Cambridge, the City Council hires a city manager who is in charge of the city’s day-to-day affairs, including drafting a budget and overseeing most of the city's staff. Since Cambridge is run by an appointed executive rather than by the mayor or the elected legislative body, the choice of a manager is among the most significant decisions the Council makes.
The Council has not had to find a new city manager since Healy took the position 30 years ago, and councillors said they will conduct a meticulous search process.
“It’s really an opportunity to apply some introspection,” Councillor E. Denise Simmons said, adding that the Council will continually ask itself, “How do we see ourselves as a city?”
On June 22, the Government Operations and Rules Committee met to discuss the process. Six of the nine councillors were in attendance, and Councillor Leland Cheung participated via conference call.
Cheung, who is a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management, spoke about the importance of soliciting feedback from Cantabrigians.
“We want to have opportunity for community input early in the process to find what it is we’re looking for and are looking to accomplish,” Cheung said.
Simmons, who was at the meeting, also envisioned a process that would consider the opinions of many stakeholders. She said that she would like to hire an independent search bureau to conduct a preliminary search for candidates.
“Once the candidates are identified and we get down to the finals, of course the City Council has the final word on who the City Manager will be,” Simmons told The Crimson.
Simmons, who in 2008 became the nation’s first openly lesbian African-American mayor, said that she hoped diversity would be considered in the decision.
“We’ve never had a person of color; we’ve never had a woman,” she said.
Councillor Craig A. Kelley spoke about the end of Healy’s tenure as a chance to change the city.
“It’s an opportunity to determine where our future lies,” Kelley said. “I don’t know that the job going forward is the same as it has been in the past.”
For Kelley, who often stresses public education at Council meetings, “the number one issue in the city time and again is education.” He said he hopes the new city manager will also put a high priority on education in Cambridge going forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former Harvard Summer School student, Steve Wu, has been banned from Harvard property according to an email sent by Summer School administrators on Friday. The email said that anyone who sees him on campus should call the Harvard University Police Department immediately but did not state the cause of Wu’s banishment.
Summer School Assistant Dean Gregory Rudolph wrote in the email that Wu has been seen on campus playing intramurals and eating in the dining hall.
Dozens of Summer School students questioned said they did not know about the situation and had not heard of Wu.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano and William J. Holinger, the director of secondary school programs for Harvard Summer School, declined to comment on the situation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being an Olympic athlete comes with its perks, from a two-week stay in Olympic Village to future commercial sponsorships. But Alex Meyer ’10 got a bonus one week before representing the US in the 10k open swimming race next week in England.
Thursday night at Stone Hearth Pizza in Allston, just blocks from where he competed as a Harvard student, Meyer received some free pizza and endless well wishes from dozens of young swimmers.
The Olympic send-off was hosted by Crimson Aquatics, an elite swimming club based at Harvard University and directed by Harvard swimming coach Tim Murphy, who is also the Team USA open water swimming coach for the 2012 Olympics.
When Meyer entered the restaurant, he was surprised by what he saw. The windows lining the restaurant were covered with inspirational posters for Meyer and rows of eager swimmers greeted him wearing customized shirts bearing Meyer’s name as well as small flags and patriotic accessories.
“I didn’t really know that they were going to do this,” Meyer said. “It was fun to hang out with these kids.”
Meyer wasn’t the only one benefiting from the celebration. In addition to autographs, children in attendance ranging from ages seven to 18 got to talk, meet, and learn from an elite athlete.
“What the kids get out of this is being able to create a vision of themselves in his position,” Crimson Aquatics coach Kyle Schack said. “Every one of these kids is going to have that image of themselves doing that someday...and that is the most important thing if anyone is going to accomplish anything—you’ve got to be able to envision it first.”
Three-time Olympian Adriana Schack agreed that the short meeting could have big dividends for the children in attendance.
“If you are an eight-year-old, you say, ‘That’s cool, I want to do that,’” Schack said. “That’s how it starts. Being in touch with Alex is going to give them a chance to dream.”
Even for kids not chasing Olympic dreams, one parent thought Meyer is still a great role model.
“Very few people make the Olympics, and he’s a personable, normal guy that just eats up the kids,” said Maura Conolly, mother two Crimson Aquatics swimmers. “He’s a great role model. He knows how to really work hard, he’s clearly intelligent, he went to Harvard, and yet he’s humble and accepting of everybody.”
In the end, the event was for Meyer, and Kyle Schack said it could help him in the race next week.
“Tonight is really great because it brings Alex back to square one with the little kids where he started and he can appreciate being in the moment,” Schack said. “In order for him to perform his best on August 10, he is going to have to stay in that moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For eight Harvard rowers, their season lasted long past the end of the school year.
Representing five different countries between them, the octet combined to earn five medals, including two silvers in the Under-23 World Championships last week.
The four was particularly heavy in Crimson representation, featuring three Harvard competitors. Pat Lapage ’12 and junior Andy Holmes raced for Great Britain, and senior Josh Hicks represented Australia.
In the final round, Hicks’ boat raced to a second-place finish, just ahead of Great Britain’s third-place crew.
The fact that he beat two classmates, Hicks said, made the victory even sweeter.
“That was the best bit, beating some of your teammates,” Hicks said. “Beating your buddies is half the fun of rowing. It was just fantastic, Pat Lapage and Andy Holmes are both fantastic rowers.”
Hicks’ silver medal is more impressive in light of the fact that he had been with his three boatmates for only three weeks while all of the other Australian boats were assembled in April. But Hicks said that the timing worked out well.
“We had three weeks instead of three months,” Hicks said. “Our coach impressed upon us how there was a big sense of urgency; we couldn’t waste a training session. It was almost perfect because you had just enough to come together properly as a crew, but it wasn’t so long that your progress starts to stagnate.”
The British boat spent even less time together because of conflicts with the Henley Royal Regatta.
The other Harvard rower to earn silver was incoming freshman Vincent Breet, who earned it for South Africa. Incoming freshman Jay Ditsmarsch won bronze for Australia.
Independent of garnering the new hardware, Hicks said he enjoyed racing for his country.
“It’s a massive honor to be representing your country on any level, whatever country that is,” Hicks said.
Men’s crew head coach Harry Parker said the benefit of the international races extend beyond fostering national pride.
“That [U-23] experience is clearly very valuable,” Parker said. “They go to these U-23 events and they’re competing against the same people they compete against and with at Harvard, and it’s really great for their development.”
Not only did the World Championship event contribute to the development of Harvard rowers, but it also displayed how far the crew has come in recent years.
“This time last year, I think we had two bronze medals and that was it,” Hicks said. “The program at Harvard is getting better and better.”

CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this story, Vincent Breet was said to have earned a silver medal for Russia. In fact, he won the medal for South Africa.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
July 19, 1945: Howard Mumford Jones Aids POW Reorientation
While Harvard's name has been included in the list of 100 leading American colleges and universities participating in the program for reorientating the 370,000 German war prisoners now being held in 450 camps in this country, the University's part in the program, it was learned yesterday, consists only in the work of Howard Mumford Jones, professor of English.
Professor Jones, on a one year's leave of absence from the University, has prepared textbooks which will form the core of the English course for the German POWs. The book will be used not only to teach the elements of English, but likewise to further among the prisoners a better understanding of American ideals and traditions.
July 19, 1956: Senseless Sentence Stymies Sentence
One of the current pastimes of Summer School students is a game in which the participants try to determine or explain the meaning of a sentence in one of the textbooks used in education courses. No one has yet won.
July 18, 1969: Joe McCarthy Legacy Is Still Alive in Mass.
Senator Joe McCarthy is dead but his legacy lives in the form of a powerful branch of the Massachusetts State Police known as the Division of Subversive Activities.
When the Division was created in 1954, evidence was collected and used to force faculty members to resign from M.I.T., Salem State College, and Lowell Technological Institute because of their alleged Communist affiliations.
Today, college campuses in Massachusetts are attracting an increasing amount of the Division's resources.
July 17, 1979: English as Foreign Language Draws Greatest Enrollment
"English as a Foreign Language" is the most popular course at the Summer School this year, followed by Expository Writing and Chemistry S-20, "Organic Chemistry."
English S-D1, "English as Foreign Language," has 215 students for the first term. The second session, English S-D2, has 154 students. The course's enrollment has more than doubled over the past three years, Marshall R. Pihl, associate director of the Summer School, said yesterday.
Most of these English students are from Japan, Latin America and the Near East, Pihl said. He added many of them need to improve their English before entering American universities or they want to spend a summer in Boston while learning English. The drop of the dollar on international markets makes the program less expensive for foreign students, Pihl added.
