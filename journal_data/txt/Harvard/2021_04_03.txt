Director Francis Lee’s “Ammonite” is a thing of drab beauty, brimming with grey skies and muted ardour. Set among the fossil-studded cliffs of Lyme Regis, England, Lee’s second film chronicles a fictional relationship between two historical figures. It hits all the right marks — the cinematography is stunning, the acting is superb, the script sparse but beautiful. But ultimately, its emotional core leaves viewers unfulfilled.
Kate Winslet gives a career-defining performance as the gruff, astute paleontologist Mary Anning, torn between her love for the work for which she gains no recognition, and her responsibility to provide for her ailing mother by selling off the fossils she finds. Saoirse Ronan is an apt foil as Charlotte Murchison, a wealthy man’s sick wife who comes to take the air in Lyme Regis. There is no want for talent and warmth in the rest of the cast; the shy foreign doctor played by Alec Secăreanu of “God’s Own Country” and Anning’s former flame Elizabeth Philpot, played by the inimitable Fiona Shaw, are two standouts.
“Ammonite” is a study in contrasts: the diligent, taciturn Anning set against the temperamental, wealthy Murchison. They are never quite on equal footing. Anning spends much of the film caring for Murchison as a child or invalid, tucking her in bed and putting cooling cloths on her body. In one of Winslet’s best scenes, they attend a social soirée together; Anning watches Murchison and her new high-society friends from afar, her hope that Murchison will turn to look at her (and the inevitable disappointment when she does not) almost painful to watch. The gulf between them is never more stark than when Murchison kisses Anning right in front of a housemaid, then dismisses Anning’s obvious bewilderment with an offhand, “It’s just the maid.”
This distance between the two romantic leads is clearly a purposeful decision on the part of Lee; the lack of intimacy is baked into the bones of the screenplay and the directing. In one of several out-of-context stand-alone scenes scattered throughout the latter half of the film, they are framed in bed together. Murchison is fully clothed and looking out past the lens. Anning, naked and curled around her, could be miles away as she tells a bawdy joke in a detached monotone. Though the distance serves a narrative purpose, it also undercuts the romance itself. At times the script seems to forget the love story, leaving Winslet and Ronan to do the heavy lifting of making it believable.
More subtle — and, occasionally, more interesting — than the romantic relationship between Anning and Murchison is the unfolding story of Anning’s scientific legacy. In the opening scene, a male curator of the British Museum discards Anning’s handwritten tag on an ichthyosaurus and replaces it with a typed note, sans Anning’s name. Past that, there is the wonderful visual metaphor of the titular ammonite, which Anning pulls from the black cliffs of Lyme Regis, cleans with painstaking precision, and sells to Roderick Murchison. It makes only one other appearance, when Anning goes to visit Murchison in her decadent London home. Stored in a glass cabinet among other curios, the ammonite has been relabeled, clearly by Murchison herself, so that Mary Anning’s name holds pride of place. The beat during which Anning looks at it is perhaps the most convincing moment of connection between the two leads — and they’re not even in the same room.
Finally, an obligatory note on “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” Many journalists have pointed out the uncommon similarities between “Ammonite” and director Céline Sciamma’s “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” That comparison is overhasty. Yes, on paper, some of the scenes from “Ammonite” bear more than a passing resemblance to those from “Portrait.” There is the walking along a windy beach and the lacing up of a corset and the playing of a keyboard while a lover watches. But “Portrait” is suffused with longing, rich with warmth and color, a thesis on the essential equality of the female gaze. “Ammonite” is not — and has never striven to be — the same. “Portrait” feels like staring into a bonfire; “Ammonite” feels more like being on the business end of a flamethrower.
Still, “Ammonite” is well worth the watch, if you look past the slightly gratuitous sex scenes and occasionally limping romance. Look out for the ending shot, which is hauntingly beautiful: two women, in a man’s institution, separated by a glass container that at once blocks them from each other and keeps Anning from her own work and legacy. Especially when set in contrast with the last shot of Lee’s debut film, “God’s Own Country,” which pulls the two male lovers together into an embrace framed by the harsh corrugated lines of a factory, it’s a knockout. Say what you will about Francis Lee — the man knows how to end a film.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains spoilers.
When the cardinal rule of “don’t kill a kid on screen” is broken within the first five minutes of “Sentinelle,” viewers know to leave their expectations at the door. The 2021 French film follows army translator Klara (Olga Kurylenko) after she is sent home from Syria following a particularly traumatic encounter in the field. She is begrudgingly transferred to the Opération Sentinelle in her hometown of Nice, a counter-terrorism homefront operation. Now living with her mother and sister, Klara must deal with her trauma as it manifests itself in impulsivity on the job, nightmares, and a burgeoning addiction to the migraine painkillers prescribed to her after the incident. When her sister, Tania (Marilyn Lima), is horrifically assaulted after she and Klara part ways at a nightclub, Klara uses her military skillset to seek revenge on the man responsible.
The most stunning feature of this film is its cinematography. Though the aesthetics of the film are not highly stylized — with the world of “Sentinelle” subtly colored in desaturated shades of blues, greens, yellows and neutrals — the editing choices contribute to the assertive yet anxious tone of the film. The audience experiences the world of “Sentinelle” just as Klara does. The film utilizes a lot of quick scenes with sharp cuts, where the passage of time becomes murky and memories go missing. There is no sense of how Klara moves from place to place, and her perception of the world is dizzying. The gradual build-up of this effect in the film beautifully shows the deterioration of Klara’s inner psyche. When the viewer receives no more information than the protagonist, the film’s stakes are raised, deepening feelings of anticipation and dread.
Though brutal and frequent, the violence in this film is by no means gratuitous. The fight scenes are high-energy, and the characters are matched such that there is a real, palpable tension in waiting to discover the winner of each fight. While not for the faint of heart — since the weapons of choice include knives, guns, glass, a collateral ceramic sink, and even a salad fork — the intense action within the film is more than enough to satisfy the most enthusiastic of adrenaline junkies.
Narratively, the film is much less fulfilling. The one constant throughout “Sentinelle” is Klara’s isolation from the world she occupies. She is distanced from both spheres of her life — from the masculine world of the military where she is set apart by both skills and compassion, and from the feminine world of her home in Nice, where the women of her family don’t fully understand all of the horror that Klara has had to encounter. There is no arc or resolution within either of these gendered worlds, except for a worsening of her seclusion in both spheres throughout the film; she only becomes more isolated from both of them. The only change from beginning to end is that Klara gets the revenge she’s after. Tania, the actual victim, never wanted that revenge though — and that tension is never addressed or resolved. There’s a clear set up for a strong commentary on gender, violence, trauma, and the concept of revenge feminism, but with a short, 80 minute runtime, there’s no space to fully realize these ideas that the storyline sets up. Though this is no failure in regards to the acting — Kurylenko masterfully portrays the nuance and depth of the haunted Klara — the talent of the cast is ultimately undermined by the script.
“Sentinelle” is gritty, technically interesting, and satisfies one’s itch for a quick action film. Though the runtime does allow for an experience of low investment, the film is predominantly one-noted. “Sentinelle” ultimately falls short for those who want more poignancy from a narrative that carries so much potential for social commentary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the writers of the Harvard anti-Asian racism resource page that came under fire this week for its controversial language said in an interview Friday that the resources were repurposed without revisions from a flyer created early in the pandemic before a dramatic increase in anti-Asian attacks.
Catherine B. Teotico, a clinical psychology intern who left Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services after her training finished in May 2020, apologized for the harm that was caused by the page and said she would have made significant changes to the webpage in the wake of the Atlanta spa shootings on March 16, which killed eight, including six Asian women.
Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen issued an apology on Wednesday for the now-deleted page’s “insensitive and inappropriate content,” which included telling students “you may wish that you weren’t Asian, but remember that your ancestors likely went through similar or even worse incidents.” The page began circulating on social media Wednesday, with students criticizing it for generalizing the AAPI experience and playing into Asian American stereotypes.
A flyer from which the site’s tips were pulled, titled “Managing Anti-Asian Racism and Xenophobia During the Covid-19 Pandemic,” was attached at the bottom of the page. The flyer was credited to Teotico and Wenhui Yang, a mental health counselor at CAMHS. Both writers are of Asian descent. Yang did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Teotico said CAMHS did not reach out to her about the controversy, and she was not aware of it until The Crimson contacted her.
She said the flyer was originally created in early March 2020 after she and Yang led a virtual CAMHS panel on the rise in anti-Asian hostility since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. About 10 Harvard students and staff attended and spoke about their experiences.
Teotico said the panel attendees requested she and Yang put together the resource page so they could “have something to hold onto,” as well as distribute information to individuals who could not attend. The flyer was meant to compile everything discussed during the panel, including both personal experiences and suggested coping skills.
A lot of the wording, she explained, came directly from AAPI students who spoke during the panel. The message that “you may wish you weren’t Asian,” for instance, was meant to reflect the experience of a particular student, Teotico said.
“The line from there isn't necessarily to say, ‘Hey, you don't want to be Asian,’ but actually comes from an Asian American student at Harvard who said, ‘It's been so painful. The experiences that we've gone through [have] been so harsh that sometimes I wish I wasn't,’” Teotico said.
As an immigrant from the Philippines, she said the students’ testimony was “heartbreaking” to hear.
“Asian American identity is very much something I hold dear and is really really important to me,” Teotico said. “And that commentary comes from people wanting to shut away that experience because it's been so hurtful — it's been so devastating for them and their community.”
Other parts of the flyer were also taken directly from student experiences.
“We just typed basically everything that was said from the panel and the discussions that we had,” Teotico said. “[The line on the webpage,] ‘when you experience racism, you can feel alone and isolated’ is pretty much directly quoted from people's experiences as they were sharing it in the panel. Or ‘It's easy to feel like the “other”’ — that was constantly being brought up.”
Before the flyer’s information was reposted on the CAMHS website, Teotico said several people read it, and it was emailed to the panel’s student participants and internally within CAMHS. From there, she said a web developer pulled the flyer information and uploaded it onto the site.
If she had known her tips were going to be reused in the context of the Georgia spa shootings, Teotico said she would have made substantial changes that took into account how anti-Asian attacks have increased since last year.
“We can't just take different flyers and just repurpose them for different particular things,” she said. “This was in a very specific place in time.”
“If I were to create a resource again for just the Georgia shootings, it wouldn’t be this — because I’m not telling people to do some grounding exercises or belly breathing or meditation. There's righteous anger coming from the fact that our community is constantly being targeted,” she added.
Teotico said she would have shifted the focus from “how do we, as an Asian American community, manage the racism we’re experiencing” to including information on how those outside the AAPI community can provide support because “Asian Americans should not be the only ones holding all this.”
“It’s not only up to us as Asian Americans to push for change, and to push for equality within our community and respect, it's also up to a lot of other individuals to provide allyship, to lift up these voices that were often relegated to silence and invisibility,” Teotico said.
After hearing the student criticisms of the flyer’s original language, Teotico said she regrets not using quotes to denote content that was based on personal experiences and not meant to be generalized.
“These were things that people had said, not in the sense to degrade anybody or to minimize people’s experiences,” she said. “It's coming from a very personal experience for somebody, and I think, in trying to reach that one individual, it hurt a lot of other people.”
“That wasn’t my intention, but the harm is done,” she added. “I apologize for the individuals who were hurt by how I’d written it.”
HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry did not respond to questions about Teotico’s remarks.
For some students, even considering that the page was written early in the pandemic, the page felt more harmful than helpful.
By opening with “although most individuals are not racist, and these events are infrequent,” the resources were “completely ruined” for Caron S. Kim ’24. She said that even though the page was from earlier in 2020, incidents of anti-Asian violence “have always been there.”
“Off the bat, saying, ‘This probably isn't going to happen to you, and you probably don't feel this way, but just in case you do, here you go,’ I feel like that's already the wrong message to be sending right from the beginning,” she said.
For Elynna Y. Chang ’21, the flyer’s language dug deep into Asian American stereotypes of filial piety and the model minority myth, especially the line comparing student experiences to that of their ancestors.
“Can we not talk about pain as well?” she said. “The whole Asian American experience is not just the model minority myth: being shy and quiet but happy. There’s so many other aspects to this, and it almost forces the narrative down our throats.”
Alexander K. Park ’23 said what disappointed him more than the page’s wording was that “CAMHS had a carelessness” about the situation.
“The level of care that went into this, especially in a time of great pain for us, was just not there, which I think is telling of the underlying attitudes of Harvard about Asian Americans and also the underlying attitudes of American society as a whole about Asian Americans,” he said.
Learning that the flyer was written by two Asian staff members did not change Park’s feelings about the page, who said “two Asian Americans are obviously not representative of the entire Asian American community.” Regardless, a higher-up should have been able to recognize “language like this is problematic,” he said.
