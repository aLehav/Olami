After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Does good art have to be innovative? What is craftsmanship worth without freshness? These questions are particularly relevant in the world of indie rock music, a descendant, of course, of rock, a style whose creative peak arguably occurred 50 years ago. Since rock’s zenith in the '60s and ’70s, the narrative usually goes, artists have made minor innovations –– punk in the later ’70s, grunge in the ’90s –– but rock is no longer the place where mass popularity and musical artistry intersect. Hip-hop stole that crown in the late ’80s and shows no signs of relinquishing it soon.
So what can be expected from indie rock, a genre that will probably stick around for a while, even if its artists will not be as famous as Kanye West or Kendrick Lamar? Should it content itself with recombining elements from rock’s heyday, adding occasional new seasoning to a familiar recipe? Or should it search for a new direction, a path to a fully modernized version of rock music? 10 years ago, two of indie rock’s most popular artists issued essentially opposite answers to that question in the form of Grizzly Bear’s album “Veckatimest” and Animal Collective’s “Merriweather Post Pavilion.”
“Veckatimest” does not sound exactly like anything that came before it, but almost every feature of it can be traced to a well-known rock antecedent. The bouncing feel and falsetto harmonies of “Two Weeks,” “Cheerleader,” and “While You Wait for the Others” evoke the psychedelic work of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. The jazzy chords in “Southern Point” and “Hold Still” call to mind rock cult heroes David Crosby and Nick Drake. Ed Droste’s relaxed but emotive singing across the album sounds indebted to Radiohead’s Thom Yorke. Many of the songs are great, and there is a lot of distance between this type of work and regurgitation or plagiarism, but still, “Veckatimest” is far from revolutionary.
Meanwhile, “Merriweather Post Pavilion” has relatively little in common with canonical rock music. Sure, it has its share of ’60s-evoking melodies and harmonies, but few others in rock sing with the robotic automation that Panda Bear brings to “Daily Routine” or write leaping melodies like the one Avey Tare navigates on “Bluish.” While Grizzly Bear’s recordings feature discernible guitars, keyboards, and drum sets, “Merriweather Post Pavilion” leans on synthesizers for melodic and harmonic support, and when more conventional rock instruments appear, they are often processed beyond recognition. The album also pulls from a variety of genres that tend to have little interaction with rock. “Brother Sport”’s hypnotic instrumental passage evokes house music, the didgeridoo on “Lion in a Coma” conjures indigenous Australian music, and in general, Avey Tare and Panda Bear’s shouted delivery of their angular melodies is reminiscent of the shape-note singing of the southeastern United States. Rock music was cosmopolitan in its golden age, with each great artist mixing unique combinations of sounds that had not previously intermingled, and Animal Collective brings that eclectic spirit back to the center of their music, making a case for indie rock as an up-to-date and relevant style.
The debate between the two albums was never settled. “Veckatimest” and “Merriweather Post Pavilion” met with commercial success and critical acclaim. Both made the top 20 on the Billboard album charts and the top 10 in Pitchfork’s “Top 50 Albums of 2009” list. Evidently, innovation is appreciated, but not required by indie rock fans. That is fine — rock is no longer all about boundary-pushing, so fans who do not prize creativity are not “missing the point” — but if the genre ever returns to its former status as a leading creative area in the musical world, it will likely be thanks to adventurous albums like “Merriweather Post Pavilion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Believe it or not, nine years have passed since Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” shocked film pundits and audiences alike by scoring a massive $116.1 million opening weekend, en route toward a total gross of over $1 billion worldwide. Despite earning mixed-negative reviews from critics (a middling 51 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes), audience sentiments were loud and clear: They wanted more live-action remakes from the House of Mouse.
Accordingly, Disney greenlit multiple remakes of their animated classics in quick succession. “Maleficent,” a riff on Disney’s classic “Sleeping Beauty” fairytale, was released in 2014. 2015 saw a live action redo of “Cinderella.” Jon Favreau's take on “The Jungle Book” was released in 2016 alongside an “Alice” sequel. And 2017 saw Disney’s biggest hit to date with this new sub-genre, as their live action adaptation of “Beauty and the Beast” stunned box office analysts by earning nearly $1.3 billion worldwide. Up to bat this year are new takes on Disney favorites “The Lion King” and “Aladdin,” along with a remake from the very man who started the trend: Tim Burton’s “Dumbo” was recently released on March 29.
“Dumbo” was a disappointment. Earning just $116 million in its global debut, it's likely the film won't be able to turn a profit when considering its massive expenses (a $170 million budget before marketing). The question then becomes, why? Why did Alice break box office records while Dumbo got left in the dust? What the hell happened?!
The films that make up the Disney canon aren’t all equally beloved.
Not every movie is a “Beauty and the Beast.” While audiences across generations can likely sing a bar or two of “Be Our Guest,” the same can’t be said for much of Disney’s library. So while we might expect a new take on Disney’s iconic “Cinderella” film to be a global success worldwide, it’s probably unwise to assume all films can live up to that standard. Maybe modern audiences are simply not nostalgic for “Dumbo” in the way that they are for a “Lion King.” Even if Dumbo is remembered as a character, that doesn't necessarily mean audiences want to see his story retold on the big screen.
The remake plots all feel the same.
“Dumbo” might also have suffered from audiences growing tired of the kinds of plots chosen for the live action remakes, as they have gotten increasingly similar over the years. Viewers might wonder why they should see a curious young girl venture into a magical world with “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms” when they just saw Alice venture into Wonderland. Why should they watch Mary Poppins help a father regain the joy of childhood in “Mary Poppins Returns” when they just saw Winnie the Pooh do the same with Christopher Robin? Purposely or not, the creative heads at Disney seem to be more-or-less repeating themselves with each succeeding picture, and audiences may feel the plots of these films have run stale.
Tentpole blockbusters are simply not a huge deal anymore.
The notion of a live action Disney fairytale isn’t the spectacle it once was. When “Alice” was released in 2010, big budget 3D features were still a relative rarity. “Alice in Wonderland” was the first film to capitalize on the audience demand for an immersive fantasy world created by “Avatar” three months prior. In 2019, however, studios routinely spend hundreds of millions of dollars on any number of films: The last four months alone saw films like “Aquaman,” “Alita: Battle Angel,” and “Captain Marvel” — to name a few — get budgets that would have turned heads a decade prior. When flashy new blockbusters essentially become par-for-the-course, it’s no wonder why a film like “Dumbo” might struggle to stand out.
The live action Disney remakes aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. With “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” already on tap for this summer, Disney has a “Maleficent” sequel scheduled for October, a “Mulan” remake opening in March of 2020, and retellings of “The Little Mermaid,” “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” and “Lady and the Tramp” currently in the development stage. If Disney does not want another Dumbo-level failure, they have to budget their films with audience demand in mind, acknowledging that flashy special effects aren’t enough anymore, and diversify the kinds of stories they’re telling. They’d be dumbos themselves not to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For over a decade, Belgian choreographer Luc Jacobs has been at the center of the innovative Israeli dance troupe Batsheva Dance Company, serving as Senior Rehearsal Director. Despite his classical background, Jacobs’ creative practice is undeniably multi-faceted, ranging from Tibetan Buddhism to the Gaga movement language, a distinctive dance style introduced to Batsheva by visionary House Choreographer Ohad Naharin.
This April, Batsheva Dance Company made its Boston debut with its ambitious production “Venezuela.” Jacobs spoke with The Harvard Crimson about “Venezuela,” the power of Gaga, and Batsheva’s role in the future of contemporary dance across the globe.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your path as a dancer to Batsheva?
Luc Jacobs: I was trained as a classical dancer and had a classical career. At the time, I was living in Belgium. I was born in Antwerp, and so I always went to performances of NDT [Nederlands Dans Theater] which was very close to me. I remember at a certain time I went to see the latest piece of Jiří Kylián with works from Ohad [Naharin], and I remember reading in the program about this Israeli choreographer, and being surprised because I didn’t really know where Israel was, and that they would have dance there — so I was quite intrigued.
Throughout my career as a classical dancer, I just felt something was lacking, some kind of dimension of expression. So when I finally met Ohad, pretty late in my career, it just moved me, and I felt that all my questions were answered, at least for a long time. It was really coming home for me.
THC: So in a way, coming to Batsheva and the Gaga movement language addressed the tension between your classical training and this more radical desire for organic gestural expression.
LJ: Yes and no — and I might add, through Gaga I rediscovered my appreciation for classical ballet again. At first, it was like, “Wow, I’m free,” but then through doing Gaga, I realized when we talk about “Gaga” that it already exists in dance. So in a way, it’s nothing new.
You know, at the end of the day, we have a body with two arms and two legs. So it’s not that we can throw anything away — and Gaga is inclusive. It doesn’t reject anything. If you take a class, you might find elements reminding you of other models, such as ballet, or Feldenkrais, or Tai Chi, or yoga. With Gaga, it’s not a technique. I usually compare it with a kind of virus that infiltrates what we already know.
THC: What is it like taking a large-scale work like "Venezuela" and bringing it to life?
LJ: The piece is about three years old now, but it’s still evolving. Some dancers have been doing it for three years, so there’s a natural maturation that goes on, in the work, but also in the dancers. When you first premiere a work, it’s a little like learning a new language, or driving a car: At first, it’s very chunky, and you need to think about it, but once you master that language, you can start to actually dance, and play.
THC: Putting on shows like "Venezuela" pushes into unfamiliar artistic territory. How do you make sure you’re connecting with a wider audience?
LJ: When you come to a Batsheva show, it’s less conceptual. The work meets you at a place where we share our humanity. It’s like food or music, it doesn’t matter which nationality, which level of education, which religion you belong to, but if you eat a piece of chocolate, or if you see the sunrise, if somebody kisses you, or a dog bites your arm — it works on a level that goes beyond what separates us.
And of course, we cannot teach somebody how to listen, and sometimes people will get offended, because we bring our history, and we look at history through the lens of our education, religion — but Ohad is really a master at tickling your imagination, and he knows how to connect you through the back door, not the front.
THC: Would you say there’s a responsibility to spread the Gaga message?
LJ: I’m not sure if that’s the intention, or if it’s more of a symptom of Ohad’s personality. He’s huge, as a person — if he walked into a room it would be very difficult to ignore him. But yes, you are right, our work, especially now it has gained more popularity with the documentary, “Mr. Gaga” and the success his work has had — it’s really something that is infiltrating the whole world now.
We are something spinning, something spreading. I’m not sure if that is a deliberate intention. I think it’s just a byproduct of how in general, we just do what we love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A troubling pattern of insufficient support for underrepresented students at the Graduate School of Arts of Sciences has emerged over the last few months. In December, leaders of several student affinity groups submitted a proposal to administrators that demanded changes in the way both Dudley House and GSAS sustain affinity groups and diversity programming. In March, Aaron Benavidez — a finance officer from the Latinx Student Association at GSAS — sent out an email to over 100 students and administrators alleging that the school’s Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs failed to give adequate financial support to the organization.
These concerns come during a time of administrative change at GSAS, as Dudley House Faculty Deans James M. Hogle and Doreen M. Hogle plan to step down in June. This coincides with the splitting of Dudley House into “Dudley Community” — largely for undergraduates outside of the 12 residential House communities — and another group for graduate students.
Given that many of Harvard’s graduate schools have difficulty representing students from different backgrounds and identities, it is concerning that GSAS — the second-largest student body on campus — has faced multiple diversity-related issues recently.
As GSAS prepares for the Hogles’ departure, the University has an opportunity to set the tone on diversity in the school’s future. In doing so, they should carefully consider the 12 changes proposed by several members of affinity groups at the school. Particularly, administrators should seek to address issues of funding and lack of institutional support in looking to improve graduate students’ quality of life, especially for students from underrepresented and under-resourced backgrounds. Under the current model, GSAS allocates funding to only “umbrella organizations, ”or student groups that are reflective of multiple groups of Benavidez’s concerns reflect this issue. Going forward, GSAS should review the utility of the marginalized students. This model seems flawed and not as supportive as it could be; “umbrella organization” system in truly supporting the financial needs of these affinity groups.
One of the 12 changes proposed by these groups is a call for the replacement of Dudley House administrator Susan Zawalich. Though we do not endorse this demand, we believe that leadership matters: Thorough and critical evaluation of current leadership is necessary for ensuring that the University’s priorities are in line with those of the student body it represents. Administrators should be ready and enthusiastic to put the University’s vision for the future in practice, and the administration should continue to assess current key administrative figures’ ability to do so.
As Dudley is split, new faculty deans are sought after, and administrators review concerns from the student body, the next few months promise much change for GSAS. Diversity and student support should be of paramount importance during this time. We hope these concerns are considered deeply and that this consideration leads to broader and more open discussion about the state of diversity at GSAS and the University as a whole.
