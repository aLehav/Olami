Economics professor Jeremy C. Stein and Kennedy School professor Jeffrey B. Liebman will soon vacate their posts at Harvard to take positions with the administration of President Barack Obama, adding their names to a growing list of Harvard intellectuals headed for the nation’s capital. 
News of Stein’s decision to go “off to Washington” was included in an e-mail sent to economics graduate students on Tuesday. 
Owen A. Lamont, a visiting lecturer in the economics department, will be covering the three spring-term economics courses that Stein will be leaving behind, according to the e-mail, which was obtained by The Crimson yesterday.
Lamont, who has long been friendly with Stein, said he learned of the professor’s impending departure two weeks ago and supported his plan to move into government.
“He is one of the world’s leading experts on the financial system,” Lamont said. “I can’t think of a better person to be in Washington right now—other than [Lawrence H.] Summers.”
Summers, the former University President, was named director of the National Economic Council in November.
Stein, whose research has focused on subjects such as behavioral finance and stock market efficiency, will be joining Summers, Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75, and a handful of other Harvard professors in the Obama administration.
Liebman will also be in Washington—helping to oversee the policies and management of federal agencies as the new executive associate director of the president’s Office of Management and Budget.
In the late 1990s, Liebman served as special assistant to the president for economic policy and coordinated the Clinton administration’s social security reform technical working group.
Neither Liebman nor Stein could be reached for comment late last night. 
Stein has been at Harvard since 2000, serving also as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, and, in 2008, as the president of the American Finance Association. Prior to Harvard, he spent ten years on the finance faculty of MIT’s Sloan School of Management.
Lamont, who did his doctoral studies under Stein at MIT and previously taught finance at the Yale School of Management, said he was prepared to  take on Stein’s duties and that the University would be able to weather his older colleague’s absence.
“Harvard is a top university, there’s always going to be times when the country needs a Harvard professor,” he said. “Fortunately Harvard is flexible enough to deal with that.”

Many Harvard Law School graduates have made millions toiling away in corporate law offices, but two alums recently found another opportunity to hit the seven-figure mark—by competing in a race that spanned 40,000 miles and nine countries.
Victor H.J. Jih, who graduated from the Law School in 1996, and his younger sister Tamara “Tammy” Tien-jan Jih, who graduated a decade later, will appear on the 14th season of CBS’s “The Amazing Race,” which premieres Feb. 15. 
The CBS reality television show pits 11 pairs of contestants against each other in a race around the world to the finish line—and a one million dollar prize. Competitors traveled to nine different countries—including India, Romania, and Siberia—all in the span of 22 days, according to a CBS press release.
Contestants cannot discuss the race itself before the show airs, so whether the Jihs won or were the first to be eliminated remains to be seen.
Victor Jih, a 35-year-old partner at the Los Angeles-based law firm O’Melveny & Myers LLP, said he has been interested in The Amazing Race since its first season. In a previous round, he applied with a O’Melveny colleague and was turned down as a contestant.
“I’ve actually been a fan since it first aired many, many years ago,” he said.
Nih said that he convinced his sister to watch the show, but she said she “didn’t really keep up with it in the last thirteen seasons.”
According to Victor, Tammy, a San Francisco attorney who was 26 while the show was being taped, is the one who pushed him to apply for the show again—this time with her as his partner.
“I totally credit my sister for making the dream a reality,” Jih said.
Jih said that the process of getting on “The Amazing Race” was in some ways harder to navigate than his Law School application. According to Jih, prospective law school students know what they can do to improve themselves as a candidate. But when it came to being chosen for The Amazing Race, Jih said that he had “no sense that it was even a possibility.”
The Jihs both received their undergraduate degrees from Stanford University before going on to HLS. Both Jihs pointed to their educations as an advantage in the race. 
Tammy said, “[Competitors] have to learn very quickly how to adapt and how to handle those situations.”
The CBS press release also mentioned their Harvard Law degrees, saying, “If they can manage to set aside their sibling rivalries long enough to use their most valuable attribute—their intelligence...[they] might just have what it takes to outsmart the competition and be a force to be reckoned with.”
Jih said he did not try to frame himself as an archetypal HLS graduate in his application for the show.
“There is no trying to be Harvard or not trying to be Harvard,” he said. “It is so ingrained in who you are.”
When asked if he wanted to win the race, Victor said, “Of course I wanted to win it—I don’t want to be the Harvard grad and come in second.”

University President Drew G. Faust’s most recent Civil War book has garnered another award nomination, chosen as a  finalist in the non-fiction category for the National Book Critics Circle Award.
“This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War,” Faust’s sixth book, is among five titles that have been selected for the award.
The NBCC Award is the second award for which “This Republic of Suffering” has been nominated. Last year, the book was named a finalist for the National Book Award, though it did not win the title.
Faust, whose field of academic expertise lies in the history of the South during the Civil War and antebellum periods, focuses “This Republic of Suffering” on how Americans struggled to understand and deal with death in the aftermath of the Civil War.
Since it was published in early 2008, the book has earned both critical and popular acclaim. It was billed as “extraordinary” and “profoundly moving” by The New York Times Book Review’s Geoffrey C. Ward. It also sold about 40,000 copies in its first five months in print, the highest circulation of any of Faust’s books to date.
Though the book was not selected for the NBCC’s Winter Good Reads List, it tops the organization’s Good Reads Long List for Nonfiction, published early last February on Critical Mass, the blog of the NBCC Board of Directors.
The NBCC, an organization of over 900 book reviewers and editors from a vast array of American publications, has been giving out awards since 1975. A 24-member Board of Directors is responsible for selecting both the nominees and winners. 
The other four finalists for the non-fiction award title are journalists Dexter Filkins—who was a Nieman Foundation fellow at Harvard two years ago—and Jane Mayer; political historian and American University professor Allan J. Lichtman; and University of Kentucky history professor George C. Herring.
The winner will be announced in March in New York City.

The group of alumni who in 2003 led a successful charge to reduce what it termed “excessive” multi-million compensation for Harvard’s money managers has renewed its push for lower pay in light of Harvard’s plummeting endowment value.
The group, which first protested Harvard money manager compensation in 2003, when Harvard Management Company paid its top officials a total of $107.5 million in salaries and bonuses, wrote in a letter to University President Drew G. Faust that “it is unquestionable [that managers] collected hundreds of millions of real dollars for having created value that was, as it turns out, largely fictional.”
Following the group’s initial protests, Harvard sharply reduced payments to its chief investors to less than a quarter of their 2003 levels, and the scrutiny over salaries played a part in prompting an exodus of money managers that included HMC’s long-time CEO Jack R. Meyer.In response to the alumni letter, University spokesman John Longbrake wrote in an e-mail that senior management compensation “reflects industry standards [and] saves significant money for the university, relative to the costs of external investment management.”
Last year, compensation for HMC’s president and top five officials summed to $26.8 million for the fiscal year ending June 30—a 20 percent increase from the previous year, but a marked drop from that of five years earlier. 
The 10 signatories of the letter—all members of the College’s class of 1969—are proposing that compensation for endowment managers should not exceed that of the highest-paid academic or administrative officer of the University. 
In the academic year 2006-2007, Harvard’s highest paid official was Provost Steven E. Hyman, who brought home $549,683, including benefits. 
The alumni added that while ideally no bonuses should be awarded to endowment managers, “if, for whatever reason, the managers receive any bonuses in the future, they should be based on increased annual income for the university,” not on estimated increases in the endowment’s total value or comparisons with other market indices. 
HMC awards bonuses to managers individually based on value added to the endowment above specified market benchmarks; it subjects bonuses to a “claw-back provision” that allows the University to take back the bonuses if funds perform below these market benchmarks at later dates. 
The letter calls for Harvard to withdraw the $21 million in bonuses paid to managers for the fiscal year ending June 30—even though the endowment posted returns of 8.6 percent during that period, beating the S&P 500’s 13.1 percent fall. In the four months since then, the endowment has decreased in value by 22 percent, while the S&P has declined by 24.6 percent.
Co-signatory David Kaiser ’69 initially misunderstood the terms of the claw-back provision, but when the provision was clarified during an interview with The Crimson, he maintained that the University ought to ask for its money back because of the subsequent real declines in the endowment—even though managers have out-performed market benchmarks. 
“Obviously [there should be] no bonus in a year in which the endowment decreased in value,” Kaiser said, adding that in a time when “everything else is being cut,” it makes no sense to be awarding bonuses. 
He also said that bonuses should only be considered if “you can show a sustainable increase in the contribution that the endowment is making to the operation of the university.”
Harvard spent $1.6 billion of its endowment in 2008 to cover operating expenses and capital projects, an increase of nearly 25 percent over previous years and the University’s largest endowment payout ever. 
While some schools, including Yale, outsource large portions of endowment management work to hedge funds and external investment firms, Harvard relies heavily on its in-house managers. 
Yale Chief Investment Officer David Swensen—who makes roughly $2 million a year—has criticized HMC’s high salaries in the past, saying that such pay “tears at the fabric” of the University and leaves HMC “inherently unstable.” 
For the decade ending 2006, Yale achieved annualized endowment returns of 17.2 percent, beating Harvard’s return of 15.2 percent—a figure that the alums have cited in arguing that high returns can be achieved without high salaries and that external managers may be more cost-efficient. 
But Yale, like all universities, is not legally required to disclose how much it pays external fund managers, which complicates comparisons of overall payments to money managers.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Joseph S. Nye has been offered the post of U.S. ambassador to Japan, an appointment that could enhance the current administration’s call for greater adoption of Nye’s noted “soft power” foreign policy philosophy, according to multiple news outlets.
Nye called the press reports “premature” in an e-mailed statement and declined to comment. The former dean of the Kennedy School will make his formal decision regarding the nomination as early as the end of the week, according to the Boston Herald. 
“If it is true, I think it’s a fantastic appointment,” Pepper D. Culpepper, an associate professor at the Kennedy School, said of his colleague. “For the Obama administration to appoint someone of his caliber underscores the importance of U.S. strategic plans and vision.”
Nye, who served as the assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration during 1994 and 1995, has been a steadfast supporter of the “key alliance” between the U.S. and Japan, according to Kennedy School professor of international finance Jeffrey A. Frankel.
“He’s absolutely brilliant at understanding and speaking about the current dilemmas of Japanese domestic politics as they relate to international politics,” Culpepper said.
In the 1990s, when Americans feared the decline of their country’s economic prowess to the increasing power of Japan, Nye emphasized the importance of viewing Japan not as a rival, but as an important national security ally. Over the years, Nye has coauthored a number of reports that helped to foster U.S. relations with Japan.
In 1990, Nye coined the term “soft power” to refer to the use of nonmilitary means such as cultural goods, diplomacy, and economic aid to attract allies to a cause. He later expounded on the policy in his 2004 book “Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics.” 
The appointment of Nye, who would replace current ambassador Tom Schieffer, would complement the current administration’s call for a greater reliance on soft power, a marked contrast to what many of Obama’s top national security officials viewed as the overuse of military force, or “hard power,” during the past administration.
Nye’s nomination would mark a return to an earlier and “highly admirable” tradition of selecting distinguished intellects, Frankel said.
Nye has the “gravitas,” the rare fusion of academic credibility and past experience in public service, and the renown in the field of international relations that make him an optimal find, Frankel said.
“He’s got the managerial talent,” Culpepper said. “He has the intellectual firepower.”

Harvard students and alumni are pushing for Medical School professor Jim Y. Kim to be appointed U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, following Mark Dybul’s resignation from that influential position in U.S. foreign policy and global health the day after Obama’s inauguration.
With support from the Harvard College Global Health and Aids Coalition (HCGHAC), students are encouraging their peers to participate in a call-in and write-in campaign to Senators John F. Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. 
According to an e-mail that has been circulated through House and student organization lists by Kim supporters, the two senators have influence in selecting the nominee for this position since they serve on committees that must approve the nomination.
The student-led campaign began when Luke M. Messac ’08, a former HCGHAC member, wrote an open letter to President Obama advocating Kim as the best candidate for the position. Over 700 people, including many students, have signed the petition.
HCGHAC members said they believe this appointment is critical because the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is responsible for leading the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a comprehensive plan to fight HIV/AIDS that is often touted as a major success of the Bush administration. 
“PEPFAR could be one of the biggest programs in global health in the next 5 years, so this appointment is very important,” said Jonathan L. Weigel ’09, an HCGHAC member.
According to HCGHAC member Heidi E. Kim ’09, the widespread student support for Dr. Kim is both a result of his Harvard professorship and his extensive experience working in global health.
But HCGHAC member Krishna M. Prabhu ’11 said that the club’s support of Kim is secondary to their desire to ensure that the selection process for the office is transparent and merit-based. 
He said many students fear that the nominee may support an ideological agenda over evidence-based decision making. Kim, he said, has a record of supporting programs based on scientific data.
“If the [selection] process is truly merit-based, Dr. Kim would be the most likely candidate to come out of that,” said Weigel.

The Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy announced its latest crop of fellows earlier this week, welcoming a group of four journalists and academics who will study issues currently confronting news outlets. 
The Shorenstein Center’s fellowship, which began with the organization’s founding in 1986, funds journalists and scholars in media or politics for a semester-long research project at Harvard. Fellows are selected by a committee of the Shorenstein Center’s senior staff and Kennedy School faculty. 
Among this year’s fellows is Maralee Schwartz, a former economics editor at the Washington Post, who is spending her third semester at Harvard after serving as an Institute of Politics fellow in 2007 and a visiting Murrow lecturer at the Kennedy School last fall. 
Schwartz said she will study the emerging role of nonprofit entities in providing content for newspapers struggling to cope with the financial pressures of the digital age.
“I think that one of the hot issues now in journalism is ‘survival,’” Schwartz said. “Is the world of nonprofits and foundations a part of that survival?”
Incoming fellow James O’Shea, who was previously editor and executive vice president of the Los Angeles Times, said he relished the prospect of taking a step back from day-to-day journalism to think deeply.
“It’s a terrific fellowship,” O’Shea said. “It takes you out of your cocoon. It gives you alternate views, a broader perspective on what’s going on in journalism.”
O’Shea said he will draw on personal experience as he crafts his research project, which will focus on “the conflicts between editors and owners of newspapers.” O’Shea was leading the L.A. Times when it was taken over by Sam Zell, a billionaire real-estate investor, who many criticized for cutting content and jobs in response to the paper’s deteriorating financial situation.
“I’ll try to use my experience from that time to determine what broader themes have contributed to the problems that the industry faces,” O’Shea said. 
Mitchell Stephens, an author and professor of journalism at New York University, and Michael Traugott, a professor of communication studies at the University of Michigan, will also serve as fellows.
In addition, Nicco Mele, founder of Internet consulting company EchoDitto, will serve as a visiting Murrow lecturer, the position Schwartz held this fall. Mele, who was an IOP fellow last semester, will teach a class about the power of digital media.

Let’s Go, the student-run travel guide subsidiary of Harvard Student Agencies, has found a new publisher after over a year of hunting.
The travel guide company has been searching for a fresh deal since 2007, when St. Martin’s Press—which had published the series for 25 years—announced it would end the partnership in 2009. 
Let’s Go announced a new agreement with Perseus Books Group on Tuesday. 
The deal will provide Let’s Go with distribution by Publishers Group West and publishing by Avalon Travel, whose Web site says it is the largest independent travel publisher based in the United States. 
While St. Martin’s commissioned a report in 2001 that questioned the tone of Let’s Go’s student-focused guides and recommended the company undergo a rebranding, Avalon is taking a more sanguine view of the series’ prospects.
“Let’s Go is a really strong, quality, and targeted brand that has been publishing travel information for students for some while,” said Avalon’s Publisher, Bill Newlin. “Avalon Travel is ready to bring this series back up to the level of brand recognition and sales that it wants.”
The new contract will allow Let’s Go to expand the number of titles it offers from 15 in the 2009 edition to 26 in the upcoming 2010 edition, to be released this November. The new titles will include updated guides for many Central and South American locations.
November also marks the 50th anniversary of Let’s Go. It plans to unveil a new logo and cover design to mark the event.
In addition to the boosted publication schedule, Let’s Go also intends to begin providing online supplementary content for its guidebooks and an interactive trip planner, according to Publicity and Marketing Director Vanessa J. Dube ’10.
One of the biggest changes—beyond the new publisher and improvements to the Web site—is the company’s adoption of a new business model, said Publishing Director Laura M. Gordon '09.
“Let’s Go is overhauling the corporate structure to allow for more term-time opportunities and more student involvement, giving us the chance to capitalize on the huge number of students in Cambridge,” she said. “We are students, and we write for students.”
Because the company has sold 3.5 million guides to date, PGW sees Let’s Go as a valuable asset.
“Let’s Go is a perfect complement to our existing list of travel clients,” said PGW President Susan Reich in a press release. “It is one of a handful of series in the travel category with immediate brand recognition.”

Although US News & World Report crowned Harvard the nation’s most popular college on a list released Monday, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 questioned the methodology behind the rankings. 
The list was arranged according to yield—the percentage of students who accept a college’s offer of admittance. 
“Students decide yield,” said Robert Morse of the US News & World Report, “A high yield shows that acceptances are valuable, popular, or coveted.”
The ranking was not based on new analysis, said Morse, but on additional data that factored into their August issue on the nation’s best colleges. Harvard’s yield was 76.2 percent last spring, the highest of the 130 schools ranked in the top 50 percentile of US News’ list of best colleges.
Fitzsimmons, however, said he doubted the significance of yield as a indicator of popularity.
“I think yield is a very slippery figure in many ways, so I don’t think it’s a particularly accurate barometer for a variety of reasons,” said Fitzsimmons. 
According to Fitzsimmons, some schools try to artificially inflate their yields by choosing students who they think are more likely to come. 
Colleges may track—and take into consideration—factors such as the number of times students visit campus, whether or not those individuals have interviews during that visit, and whether or not applicants cite a school as their first choice, all of which determine how likely students are to accept admission offers. 
Schools that do this sacrifice “long term quality”, according to Fitzsimmons. 
Others factors, such as whether or not an institution has an early admissions program, also affect yield, said Fitzsimmons. Binding early acceptance clauses allow a college to guarantee the enrollment of a set percentage of their next class, while non-binding early action programs give colleges a few extra months to recruit accepted students. 
Morse admitted that these factors were not taken into consideration when schools were ranked according to yield. Nonetheless, Harvard—which eliminated early action two years ago—still took the top spot.
This spring, several factors could influence Harvard’s yield, according to Fitzsimmons, It takes three to five years for changes in admissions policy to fully manifest themselves, he said, so last year’s expansion of financial aid and the elimination of early decision two years ago may or may not affect this year’s figures.
In addition, external issues such as the economy and what Fitzsimmons called the “Obama factor”—the increased prevalence of Harvard-affiliated figures on television and on Capitol Hill—may increase the yield.  
“The downturn in the economy would make Harvard more attractive, there has never been a better time to have a great financial aid program,” said Fitzsimmons.
However, he also noted that in difficult economic times, there is a tendency for prospective students from modest backgrounds to attend college close to home. 
“We will go out expecting a figure considerably higher than 76.2 percent in case yield rises. If yield goes, up we’re covered, if yield stays where it’s been, we simply take people off the waiting list,” Fitzsimmons said.

Noted health care economist and former Dean of the Social Sciences David M. Cutler ’87 will become the latest Harvard professor to serve in the Obama administration, he said in an interview late Thursday. Cutler joins three other members of the economics department in Washington—former University President Lawrence H. Summers, and professors Jeremy C. Stein and Jeffrey B. Liebman. “I think that people who have the opportunity to help their country and the world need to, at times, do that,” Cutler said of his leave.Cutler was one of the chief architects of President Barack Obama’s health care plan—a hot-button issue during the presidential campaign—and said he will continue to work on health care policy in D.C.Cutler first came to Harvard in 1991 as an assistant professor, received tenure in 1997, and recently finished a 5-year stint overseeing the Faculty’s social science departments as divisional dean.Outside academia, Cutler has served on President Clinton’s Council of Economic advisers and on the National Economic Council, in addition to advising both Bill Bradley’s and John Kerry’s presidential bids. He has been consulting with Obama since at least April 2007. Cutler, who specializes in health care and public economics, is a vocal proponent of increasing America’s health care spending, arguing in his most recent book, “Your Money or Your Life: Strong Medicine for America’s Health Care System,” that such spending has been worthwhile despite its high costs.He had planned to be on sabbatical for the spring semester prior to his appointment, and said he plans to return to Harvard after his time in Washington. “Sometimes you believe in something and the time is right,” Cutler said of his decision to move south.—Staff writer Elyssa A.

The Harvard men’s basketball team (9-7, 1-1 Ivy) lost to Dartmouth in overtime last week, but will look to redeem itself as it takes on Ivy League foes Penn (4-10, 0-0) and Princeton (5-8, 0-0) at Lavietes Pavilion this weekend. The Crimson split its two game series with Dartmouth for the third season in a row. From the opening tip-off, Harvard could not keep pace with the Big Green, committing 17 costly turnovers and hitting just 17-for-27 from the charity stripe. “We’ve all just been talking about [how] it was a bad loss, but we have to keep fighting,” senior guard Drew Housman said. “We have a chance to beat every team, so our destiny is still in our hands.”Indeed it is, as the Crimson has shown an improvement in every facet of the game so far this season, from the breakout performances of junior Jeremy Lin to the stifling defense—even without much of a big man presence inside due to injury. Not surprisingly, Harvard has already accumulated more wins than that at the end of last season. But notching two more victories this weekend won’t be easy. While Penn and Princeton both have losing records, both teams have what it takes to pull out an upset. The Crimson must limit itself in turnovers and dominate the boards. “I think it’s been a great week of practice,” said senior captain and guard Andrew Pusar. “We believe we’re one of the best team in the league and we have to get back to that level after Dartmouth.”Point guard Housman and freshman forward Keith Wright, who matched a career-high 13 rebounds last weekend against Dartmouth, have put on impressive performances this season. Both players must be able to score and dish it out to Lin, who has been averaging a team-high 18.1 points per game. Senior forward Evan Harris may see the court this weekend after nursing an injury earlier in the season.“I have to imagine it’s a game-time decision, but I would say it’s looking optimistic,” Pusar said. Coming off of a loss against St. Joseph’s, Penn will look to establish its balanced attack this weekend against Harvard. Leading the Quakers is sophomore Tyler Bernardini, a 6’6 forward, who had two double-doubles in the last three games, along with a 23-point showing against La Salle.“We really need to focus on Bernardini,” said Housman.The Crimson must also keep its eye on point guard Zack Rosen. In his first season, the freshman sensation currently leads the Ivy League with an assist/turnover ratio of 2.13. He is also second in the league in assists, averaging 4.9 a game. Rosen can score as well, as he has put up double figures in points in four of the last six games. “I think that one of the things we know about Penn is that they’re a hard-nosed team and they’re tough in size,” Pusar said. “They have a pretty good inside-out combination and they surround their tough big men with good shooters. For us to counter that, we have to play solid man-to-man defense and function as a unit together.”Harvard must aim for a strong start on its home court, as the Quakers are 0-10 when trailing at halftime but 4-0 when leading. Penn has won twelve of the last thirteen games against Harvard, but the Crimson will hope to reverse that trend this coming Saturday.  Harvard will face the famed Princeton offense just 24 hours later. Known for their plethora of three-point attempts and the motion offense, the Tigers will bring a completely different style of play to the court. It is no surprise that in Princeton’s last game, seven different players hit at least one three-pointer against Concordia.“I think we have to be very alert on every possession against Princeton,” Pusar said. “Obviously, they’ll try to catch you off guard, so we’ll have to be aware that they’ll be constantly moving.” The Tigers are also led by a freshman point guard in Doug Davis. Though he stands at only 5’11 and weighs just 155 lbs, Davis is the team’s scoring leader, averaging 13.5 points per game. Additionally, Princeton has the size in 6’9 centers Zach Finley and Pawel Buczak to accommodate its perimeter game. With many of the Crimson’s big men out with injuries, Harvard will try to make up for size with intensity and speed. “With both teams, we want to be very aggressive on defense,” Pusar said. “We want to make both teams feel uncomfortable handling and dribbling the ball. Regardless of any size advantage, we’ll be able to force turnovers.”Though it may still be early in conference play, the Crimson feels that it must win this weekend in order to contend for its first-ever Ivy League championship.“We really need to focus,” Housman said. “Right now is the time to hold our own court in the Ivy League.” —Staff writer Kevin T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it hits the road this weekend, the Harvard women’s basketball team has the chance to pick up the 500th win in the 32-year history of the program. The main goal on its mind, though, is all about the here and now: the Crimson wants to re-establish its status as the team to beat in the Ivy League.Harvard (8-8, 0-1 Ivy) will look to shake off a Jan. 10 loss in its home opener to perennial rival Dartmouth when it continues conference play at Penn (3-12, 0-1) and Princeton (6-9, 1-0) this weekend. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight in Philadelphia and tomorrow night at 6 p.m. in Princeton.  In case the Crimson needed reminding, the Big Green reinforced the fierce, any-given-night competition that has characterized the Ivy League in recent years. While this weekend’s opponents are likely a season away from being named among the league’s elite, Harvard repeats its mantra of treating every game like a conference championship—especially after having already dropped one game.“I have enormous confidence in our talent, but then we have a game like Dartmouth and that kind of sets you back on your heels,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. On Friday night, history favors the Crimson—Harvard has won the last nine meetings between the two teams and the last seven in Philadelphia. 2009 wouldn’t seem to be the year that the tides turn for Penn, which lost its first six games of the season and has lost its last five. Still, the Crimson knows better than to take the three-win Quakers lightly. Last season, it took an Emily Tay jumper with 14 seconds remaining to steal a one-point win over Penn at Lavietes Pavilion.“Penn is very physical and playing in their house is always one of our toughest games,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “Right now, every team in the Ivy League is really dangerous and you have to respect them.”Senior forward Carrie Biemer, who leads her team in points (18.5) and rebounds (5.5) per game, is the show for the Quakers. The dramatic change in this year’s Princeton lineup is the absence of former Ivy League Player of the Year forward Meagan Cowher, who graduated last year. “It’s pretty nice [not to face her], but it doesn’t make defense easier—just different,” Finelli said. “When you face a player of that caliber, you focus all your defense on that one person. With their more balanced team, we just all have to worry about our matchups and back each other up on the floor.”The Crimson will have to contend with a few very athletic Tiger guards. Sophomore Addie Micir (12 ppg) and freshman Lauren Edwards (9.7 ppg) are a pair of six-footers who can score inside and out. Princeton beat Penn, 64-49, in the first Ivy matchup for both teams on Jan. 10.In both games, Harvard should have the advantage inside. Neither opponent has a dominant post corps to match up with Crimson forwards Emma Markley, Katie Rollins, and Claire Wheeler, so Harvard should score in bunches if it is able to work in the ball into the paint. Finding open looks will be especially important against Princeton, which enters the weekend with the best defense in the Ivies (59.9 ppg).With all the advantages on paper, the main challenge for Harvard should be mental. The Crimson must shake off two weeks of exam period rust, which Delaney-Smith insisted shouldn’t be an issue.“If there is a disadvantage, we’re going to get through it,” she said. More of a factor will be Harvard’s response to the loss that opened conference play on a low note. All signs point to the team using that loss as a springboard for a trying upcoming stretch, which includes the next four games on the road.“We’ve kind of become revitalized, and we’re remembering how much that Dartmouth game stung,” Finelli said. “That’s giving us an extra motivation going into this weekend and lighting a fire under us and getting us energized. It’s the beginning of a huge second half of the season for us.” —Staff writer Emily W. Cunningham can be reached at ecunning@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The excitement/purity/antiquity (take your pick) of the Ivy League’s “14-game tournament” comes out in full force today. Yes, all the schools not starting with P have already have already exchanged travel buddies, but the pace picks up now with four Ivy games on each Friday and Saturday night for the next six weeks.
So each week, the title picture could get clearer and clearer, or it could become more scrambled. 
Who knows, we could get all eight teams finishing with 7-7 records and the league would be forced to join every other conference in the country in having a post-season tournament.
If you’re betting at home, that’s about as likely as the Ivy representative in this year’s NCAA Tournament reaching the Final Four. Though one can dream.
On to the games, with today’s fixtures first.
PENN (4-10, 0-0 Ivy) at HARVARD (9-7, 1-1)
Penn is probably not as bad as its record shows, mainly because most of the Quakers’ losses have come against some pretty good teams, such as Villanova and other Philly schools, a solid Big 10 in Penn State, and also some team that wears sky blue and plays in Chapel Hill.
If Harvard’s record looks familiar, that is because it is the same as what the Arizona Cardinals had at the start of their tournament. Unlike the NFC champions, the Crimson needs to win more than just three games in a row to reach the promised land—try 12.
Will that run start tonight? Harvard did beat Penn by 10 last year, snapping a 12-game losing streak. The Quakers are better than they were last year, but so is the Crimson. Harvard by 10. Again. 
YALE (7-9, 2-0) at COLUMBIA (5-11, 0-2)
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and his predecessor Frank Sullivan have both stressed the danger of playing teams “with their backs against the wall.” Losers of its first two Ivy games, Columbia certainly fits the picture of a team desperately needing to win, while the Bulldogs find themselves tied for first and could be alone at the top of the table if they sweep their weekend games. But the Lions played well at home in their loss to Cornell. Expect another solid effort from a team craving Ivy victory. Columbia by five. 
PRINCETON (5-8, 0-0) at DARTMOUTH (3-13, 1-1)
This is the Ivy opener for Princeton, which hopes to end a two-year streak of finishing in the Ivy cellar, and a win in New Hampshire would be a great first step. This Tiger team looks to be better than the past two years, led by freshman guard Doug Davis. He leads the team in scoring and has been selected as the Ivy League Rookie of the Week twice already this season.
Dartmouth has its own star player in senior forward Alex Barnett, who not only has three years of experience on Davis, but he also has a contender for the world’s greatest tattoo: the St. Louis Arch. Possibly adding to the Big Green’s advantage is that it has two players from Colorado, a state that has produced a number of skilled Ivy Leaguers in recent times. Dartmouth by three.
BROWN (6-10, 0-2) at CORNELL (12-6, 2-0)
The Big Red won by double figures at Brown at this time last year, anointing it as the team to beat in the Ivies. This year, a win over the Bears won’t bring the same result. Cornell’s undefeated Ivy season last year and fine non-conference schedule has already made it the clear front-runner. Home team by 13.
PRINCETON at HARVARD
Some talk has been made about how the Harvard team and its talented freshmen will do in their first experience with the dreaded back-to-back games. However, the Crimson is not the only team playing back-to-back on this night. The Tigers not only have lost every Ivy road back-to-back game over the past two seasons, they haven’t won ANY Ivy road game in that span. Neither of those two streaks end tomorrow. Harvard by eight.
PENN at DARTMOUTH
According to my clandestine sources close to the Penn team, the Quakers should do well if they realize they aren’t playing the supremely athletic teams they battled in non-conference and are more patient on offense. Also, they need to guard Alex Barnett. Penn should learn from Harvard’s mistake last weekend when Barnett scored 30, and also take advantage of its balanced offense with guard Tyler Bernardini and forwards Brendan Votel and Jack Eggleston all averaging double figures in scoring. Visitors by seven.
BROWN at COLUMBIA
That the Bears got swept by Yale may be the biggest surprise in the Ivy season so far. Brown has a solid starting five and three players averaging more than 13 points per game in forwards Matt Mullery and Peter Sullivan and guard Adrian Williams, yet they could be 0-4 if they lose this game. 0-4 should be remembered as the result of Inter’s road game against Roma in October, not the Bears’ record. Brown by six.
YALE at CORNELL
Do you like seeing Yale lose by a lot? This game, pitting the Bulldogs against a Big Red team with three strong potential First-Team All-Ivy players in guard Louis Dale, forward Ryan Wittman, and center Jeff Foote, is for you! Cornell by 15.
Record to date: 0-0-0
