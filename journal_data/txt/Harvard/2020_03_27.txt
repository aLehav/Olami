After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, March 20, my husband and I drove to Massachusetts General Hospital to be tested for COVID-19. The process was swift and we were reassured to hear that the hospital, which had recently developed its own test, would call us with results in 24 to 72 hours. Six days later, we still are waiting to learn if we are infected.
On the surface, our story is not unusual. Newspapers across the country have reported on chronic test shortages and long laboratory delays as the number of suspected cases continues to climb. Indeed, as Harvard affiliates, we were privileged to receive tests quickly and with relative ease. Yet what distinguishes our experience is simple: My husband is a radiation oncologist who, until he developed symptoms, was treating patients on the pediatric oncology service at MGH. As long as his test results are pending, he cannot return to the hospital.
Harvard’s healthcare workers are the front line of our community’s fight against this virus. They should receive the fastest test results we are capable of producing, but they are not. Instead, my husband and many of his colleagues are furloughed indefinitely at the very time when we need their expertise most. As its healthcare workers face impossible decisions about patient coverage and the rationing of personal protection equipment, Harvard must act quickly to expedite their results.
The recent news that University President Lawrence S. Bacow and his wife tested positive for COVID-19 demonstrates that our hospitals have the capacity to turn around results in less than a day. In his email to the Harvard community, President Bacow described a swift medical response: He and his wife reported symptoms to their doctors on March 23 and were tested that same day. Like my husband, President Bacow was tested one day after he developed symptoms. Unlike my husband, he had received his results and could share those results with his employer within 24 hours.
In short, the system worked as it should. I join my students and colleagues in wishing the Bacows a quick recovery. But at a time when physicians and other essential medical staff at Harvard hospitals are furloughed — and their colleagues who might otherwise be working remotely are called into the hospital to provide coverage — the contrast between their case and ours is telling. The swift turnaround of President Bacow and his wife’s results reveals that we are seeing the effects of a growing trend of inequity in both access to and speed of COVID-19 testing within our own community.
According to President Bacow’s email, he and his wife have been working from home and practicing self-distancing measures since March 14 and, following Department of Health protocols, will continue to remain at home for at least the next 14 days. Those same protocols are currently requiring my husband, and fellow residents across several Harvard hospitals, to remain in home quarantine until they receive a negative test result. Even healthcare workers who have tested negative for the virus have seen their furlough stretch on as backlogs delay necessary clearance from their hospital’s occupational health department.
Across the world, furloughed workers place an added burden on healthcare systems that are already trying to limit hospital staff exposure, as that exposure leads to staggering rates of infection among medical staff and compromised patient care. As it becomes clear that we cannot wait for federal assistance on widespread testing, some areas are already prioritizing medical professionals.
If we have the capacity to return a test result within 24 hours, why are Harvard’s physicians and other essential medical staff still waiting nearly a week for results? While President Bacow and his wife continue their self-isolation at home, departments across the Harvard hospitals face yet another burden on a system already under tremendous strain: a staffing problem. If the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise — and it is expected to — this staffing problem will soon transform into a crisis of patient care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, my biggest worries concerned managing my classes, having three dance practices a week, organizing events for the Harvard College Women’s Center, and writing this column. But two weeks ago, I didn’t know that I would be packing up my things and leaving Harvard for the rest of the semester. I didn’t know that I would be getting stuck in Hawaii for a week with my older brother, scrambling to move my cousin out of her apartment with the threat of her being out of a job soon and unable to cover rent. And I didn’t know that all three of us would be flying to American Samoa together with the fear that we could be carrying a deadly virus back home, threatening the lives of, not only our families, but our entire community. To say that the things I was worried about two weeks ago now seem small and insignificant is quite the understatement.
In fact, as I sit quarantined in an apartment building, separated from my little brother, parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties, and cousins, I can barely summon enough concentration to carry on with classes over Zoom or even write clear sentences for this piece.
All I can think about every day is whether or not I might be carrying the virus. What if I’ve somehow already transmitted it to my family? When my little brother pulls up a plastic chair to sit outside and talk to me and my older brother through the glass window every day, all I can do is count down the days until I can give him a big hug. But when will I be able to guarantee that that is even a safe thing for me to do? Without the ability to test for COVID-19 in American Samoa, there’s no way for anyone here to know whether they might be carrying the virus — making social distancing all the more imperative.
All it takes is one person. That was all it took in 1918, when the influenza epidemic was brought onto Samoan shores and wiped out a fifth of our people. That was all it took with the measles outbreak just a couple months ago that took the lives of so many of our children, many of whom did not get to see past the age of five. And that’s all it’ll take with COVID-19 if we’re not careful.
Without local testing looking like a realistic possibility for another two months and only one hospital on the whole island with the ability to accommodate ten coronavirus patients in a special quarantine facility, it’s just like what chief executive of the LBJ Medical Center John Faumina said in his interview with NBC News this week - “One is too many for us.” With major barriers to testing and extremely limited capacities for providing quarantine and healthcare for COVID-19 patients throughout the Pacific, Pacific Islanders and those residing in the Pacific are some of the most vulnerable populations and cannot afford to take this lightly.
I know social distancing can be a hard ask, especially in small, tight-knit communities such as ours. Growing up, the screen door in my house might have been able to keep out all of the mosquitos but stood no chance against my cousins, as we’d all be running around hiding from our parents calling us to do feau.  Large family gatherings, whether for weekly Sunday toana’i or yet another fa’alavelave, are central to our way of life. Every brother, sister, cousin, aunty, uncle, parent, and grandparent is always met with a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek, never a handshake (let alone an elbow bump). Our community is a family, and in times of hardship, we are taught to come together, to hold each other and take care of one another - not to stay in isolation.
Now more than ever we must hold and take care of each other, but the best way to do that is from a distance. Every day, when I see my grandma creep near where we’re being quarantined to say hi or when my best friend (or sister rather) comes by to drop off food for me, it only gets harder. But if our community is truly our family, we must sacrifice the hugs and kisses from our grandparents, the late-night gatherings in the faleo’o talking story with all the cousins, and the ifa sessions with all our aunties after toana’i. Because it’s not even just our families’ lives at stake. It’s the lives of our people — the life of our histories and our traditions. So please, let’s hold each other from a distance, because it’s the only way we’ll get through this.

It was a sticky June in New York, the city I was supposed to grow out of in two months, when I panicked and deferred my college admission. Instead of the extensive pro-con lists I usually make to combat my chronic indecisiveness, I had some angsty journaling and a single, abbreviated chart, and no plan — just an overwhelming sense that it wasn’t time yet. With 13 unplanned months stretching ahead of me, the fear of crafting a non-optimal gap year was paralyzing. Every option seemed insufficient — too close to home, too far, too voluntourist-y, didn’t pay enough. I spent the rest of the summer wallowing in a deep, indulgent, seemingly self-inflicted depression, terrified that the only impulsive decision I had ever made would also turn out to be the worst.
My reluctance to commit was slowly hardening into regret when someone finally intervened. A former teacher knew someone who knew someone who owned a vineyard in Spain. I spoke Spanish and was clearly miserable. Did I want to go and work the harvest?
I said yes and bought a plane ticket with only a hazy idea of what I had signed up for. I soon found myself under the late August sun in rural Catalonia, dirty beyond the help of a shower, wielding dull shears to wrestle bunches of grapes from thick, endless vines.
These were not just any grapes — I was deep in bubbly country. It was cava for breakfast and cava for dinner and sometimes cava for lunch in Sant Sadurní d’Anoia, a 7.3-square-mile town an hour outside of Barcelona that clings to grandeur as the undisputed cava capital of the world. Harvest time meant that the tiny town swelled with all the pickers that could be mustered. Most made the annual trip north from Andalucía in early August, and would return south, down to the Mediterranean, for the olive harvest in November. This, of course, was not my situation. I was a gringa from New York City, living in the unused flat of someone from the vineyard’s top brass.
After a lonely first few days, I managed to befriend some of the younger pickers from the extended Córdoban family with whom I worked the vines, and we made plans to cook tortilla española. My eighteenth birthday was coming up, and some of the technicians — the people with vinicultural degrees, who oversaw fermentation inside the bodega — were going to take me to the relatively cosmopolitan capital of the region, Vilafranca del Penedés, to celebrate. But I wasn’t sleeping well, still anxious that I had fallen into a series of imperfect choices.
By the time an at-large terrorist was found hiding in Sant Sadurní, it felt like I had been there for months. A fact check reveals the actual time elapsed: one week.
***
I read about the attack in the New York Times. On August 17, at least 13 people were killed and 80 gravely injured when a white van drove through Las Ramblas, Barcelona’s busy tourist thoroughfare. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility. It was the deadliest act of terrorism in Spain since the Madrid train bombings in 2004.
It wasn’t fear that rippled through Sant Sadurní; instead, it was sadness. We were only an hour outside Barcelona, but this slice of the Catalonian countryside wasn’t like Westchester, where everyone knew someone who lived in the city that they needed to call. This was a rural agricultural town in an archipelago of similar ones.
I explained this fact to the number of concerned people back home who saw the news and emailed me. Yes, I was in Catalonia, but I heard about it the same way you did. Yes, I am sure the country is in mourning, but the town, not quite. Or maybe I don’t know enough people yet to be able to tell. Regardless, my new daily rhythm carried on.
Four days later, my supervisor texted me: Go home and stay inside. I was headed back already; I had walked down into the town square to buy some eggs and jamón for dinner, but I found police vans and yellow ropes blocking the streets. Officers were unloading on the corner as I approached my first-floor flat.
I turned on the local news. It was in Catalán, a language I did not speak but was starting to understand. Van driver found in Sant Sadurni d’Anoia, Subirats district, the banner said. Police in pursuit. Suspect thought to be carrying explosives.
The man had been identified on the street by a local resident of Sant Sadurní, the reporter said. He looked suspicious, the witness told police, because he was wearing a long-sleeved shirt on a hot day.
After the police shot and killed the man, there was talk that he had been living in our town the whole time.
***
I remembered that the lock to my apartment sometimes stuck and put a kitchen chair in front of my door. With the perimeter secured, I sat cross-legged on the floor and waited, slowly learning the facts through the local news. No one from home was emailing me this time. Later coverage would mention that he was found in the Catalonian countryside, but failed to mention that he might have been down the street from my flat.
I could hear the police swarming the whole town outside. I heard a few gunshots, though they might have been in my head. Given the circumstances, I’d like to think I was relatively calm.
***
When I was little, my dad always reassured me that our best insurance against death by terrorism was the statistical unlikelihood that we would ever find ourselves anywhere remotely near a terrorist attack. The odds were indescribably infinitesimal, he would say, even living in New York City, in a post-9/11 world, where we’ve resigned ourselves to the easy mortality of crowded streets. That was his argument — something like a twisted but legitimate safety in numbers — and he stuck by it.
But of all the tiny towns in all the world, here I was, and so was the Barcelona van driver, both of us all alone. What was the statistical unlikelihood of that?
I decided to FaceTime my parents.
They picked up the phone wearing eclipse glasses, which were all the rage in 2017 leading up to the so-called “the Great American Eclipse.” The premise of the cheap square plastic lenses was that you could look directly at the momentous event without being blinded. My parents had donned them because the eclipse was about to happen.
It was very windy on their end. I explained that the van driver from the Barcelona terrorist attack was on the run in my 7.3 square mile town. They couldn’t hear me. They in turn explained that they were waiting for the eclipse, which I had deduced.
I explained again. I could tell they heard me this time because my mom took her eclipse glasses off. They told me not to panic and I said that I was not panicking and that I would keep them updated but that they should go watch the eclipse.
***
I don’t remember how our conversation resolved itself. The eclipse happened; the shelter-in-place lifted. One of the other pickers WhatsApped me asking if I wanted to come over to play cards. The mayor of Sant Sadurní issued a statement thanking the Catalán police force for their swift response and noted that her town had always been “a safe and peaceful place.”
It had been seven days in Spain. Another week passed; I started sleeping. The harvest season continued and I turned 18. I stayed in Sant Sadurní another month before coming home, once again without a plan. Optimizing the gap year no longer felt totally within my control.
On Aug. 22, I wrote (verbosely) in my journal:
“It’s been a strange few days, what with there being a terrorist on the loose and all and my missing of [unintelligible] coming in at an all time high. I am quite tired. Perhaps tomorrow I will write more, but I suppose we’ll see.
The days are, thankfully, starting to blur together.”

While Xiao-he Ma springs to his feet to welcome me into his office, the librarian of Chinese Collections is not entirely sure why I am so keen to interview him. His cubicle is tucked deep in the basement of the Harvard-Yenching Library, which boasts the largest collection of East Asian research and archives in the United States. As of last month, the library is also home to “Devotion,” a controversial Taiwanese video game that was removed from online streaming services. Ma, however, insists that there is nothing extraordinary about acquiring it.
“Our work is to support our faculty members, students, and visiting scholars,” Ma explains. “If the patron wants materials to do research or teaching, we usually will support them.” According to Ma, a graduate student requested to include “Devotion” in a seminar curriculum, and the Harvard-Yenching Library simply obliged.
The gaming world, however, did not view the library’s decision in such straightforward terms. Developed by Red Candle Games, “Devotion” is an acclaimed horror simulation set in a 1980s Taiwanese apartment complex. Days after its initial release on Feb. 19, 2019, “Devotion” came under fire from Chinese gamers who noticed an in-game reference to memes comparing Chinese president Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh.
In a Twitter statement, Red Candle Games apologized for what it called a “critical and unprofessional error” and pulled “Devotion” from streaming services. The game was impossible to play until last month, when it was added to the second-floor archives at the Harvard-Yenching Library. Shortly after the addition, Red Candle Games tweeted that it was “so honored” “Devotion” was part of the Harvard-Yenching collections, and news outlets swarmed to report on the story.


“They asked, why Harvard? Why does Harvard want to collect this game? I said, if you would like to do anything, you can communicate with the student,” Ma says.
Yedong Chen, the graduate student who requested “Devotion,” did not reply to multiple requests for comment on this article. He has yet to offer a public justification for his decision to include the game on his syllabus.
Nonetheless, Red Candle Games felt honored by the decision to add “Devotion” to the Yenching’s catalog. In its most recent Facebook post, the company thanked the library and wrote that “never have we thought that our works could one day be added to its prestigious collections.”
Still, Ma stresses that the library has no political or social stake in preserving the game. “Perhaps these materials have different political points of view, but this is not my problem,” he asserts gently.
I prod Ma on whether he believes there is any power in preserving contentious material, but the librarian sticks to his script. Ultimately, Ma aims to support the academic endeavors of anyone who requests his assistance, he says. While he cares deeply for the collections he curates, he chooses to distance himself from any controversy that might surround them.
“If the patrons, or students, or faculty members think these things are useful for their research, lending, or teaching, my work, and my colleagues’ work, is getting the material for them,” Mr. Ma maintains. “We don’t ask about the politics or reasoning behind the material.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council will not endorse a “Double A” grading policy, marking the Council’s third reversal on the system in just over twenty-four hours.
In an email to representatives Thursday afternoon, Council secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 wrote the legislation endorsing a “Double A” grading policy has “definitively failed to be adopted by the Harvard Undergraduate Council.” After the Council first discussed the legislation at its Wednesday emergency session, decisions about it have flipped from endorsement to no endorsement, then to endorsement again, finally ending without an endorsement.
The first change in the Council’s position occurred during Wednesday’s virtual meeting when some representatives changed their minds and decided to vote against an endorsement, which resulted in the legislation failing after it originally passed by a hair-thin margin.
On Thursday morning, Council President James A. Mathew ’21 announced that it appeared the legislation had in fact passed over a Slack group made up of Council members. Upon an initial review of the bylaws, the Council determined that representatives were not allowed to change votes on the legislation. Mathew noted that members’ ability to change their votes only applies for amendments and not for regular legislation such as the act to endorse the “Double A” model.
The final reversal came just hours later, after the Council discovered yet another procedural wrinkle stemming from Section 35.22: Approval Processes in Article III of its bylaws. The legislation on endorsing “Double A” fell within the Council’s Tier 1 category, its highest level of publicity. Under the Council’s bylaws, Tier 1 legislation must pass through a two-thirds vote of the entire Council, not just of members present.
Brennan explained the bylaws involved in his email to Council members about how the “Double A” legislation “definitively failed.”
“While we did attain a supermajority of council members present (70.6% Aye), we did not attain a supermajority of the entire Council,” he wrote.
Samyra C. Miller ’21 discovered the pivotal issue with the legislation while examining the Constitution and Bylaws of the Council following Wednesday’s virtual meeting.
In an email to The Crimson, Miller wrote that, after reading the passage on Tier 1 publicity, she remembered that the Council stated they calculated the vote by the number of Council members present during the meeting. According to Miller, she quickly discovered that the legislation to endorse a “Double A” grading model failed under these guidelines and shared her discovery on social media.
“Given the overwhelming nature of the meeting, I understand that it was easy to overlook this mistake,” Miller wrote in the email. “I think the UC's response to the grading policy issue could have gone a lot smoother had James and Ify not sent out their first endorsement email without communicating with the council and the student body.”
Prior to Wednesday’s virtual meeting, Mathew and Council Vice President Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 advocated for a “Double A” grading model in an email to students on Sunday.
In an email to The Crimson, Council treasurer Noah Harris ’22 wrote that most of the confusion may have been caused by difficulties related to organizing a Zoom meeting with over 300 participants. However, Harris wrote that he does not regret the Council allowing the student body at large to share their opinions.
“That is what we should be doing: getting the raw opinion of the student body,” Harris wrote. “This was just a minor error with the rules, but because this vote is so important, any small mistake can cost us credibility.”
Currier House representative Jack M. Swanson ’22 offered a different perspective. In an email to The Crimson, he wrote that the Council’s regulatory procedure caused further confusion on a topic about which students deserve clarity.
“If one thing is clear from the student testimony we were able to hear, it's that there is not one perfect solution to the inequities created by the situation we find ourselves in, and any reasonable policy from the UC requires nuance, an abundance of student input, and clear leadership during a turbulent time,” Swanson wrote. “Unfortunately, we saw none of those this week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College accepted 4.92 percent of applicants to the Class of 2024, representing a total 1,980 admitted students of the 40,248 who applied.
This year’s admissions rate marks a slight increase from the record-low 4.50 percent admitted to the Class of 2023. The College’s acceptance rate has steadily declined for the past several years; the bump in this year’s rate is the first increase since students applied to the Class of 2018. The number of applicants in this admissions cycle was seven percent lower than last year.
The Admissions Office notified 1,085 applicants of their admission Thursday evening, joining the 895 students admitted from the early action cycle in December.
Dean of Admissions & Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 discussed the strengths of the incoming class in a press release Thursday.
“From their applications it is clear that the Class of 2024 will bring to Harvard extraordinary talents, ideas, backgrounds, and life experiences,” Fitzsimmons said in the press release. “We look forward to giving them a preview of what Harvard College has to offer during our Virtual Visitas program and getting to know them over the next four years.”
The percentage of Asian American admits decreased to 24.5 percent compared to last year’s 25.4 percent. Asian Americans remain the largest minority group among the admitted students. African Americans comprise 14.8 percent of the admitted class, a figure that remains the same from the previous class. The percentage of Latinx admits increased to 12.7 percent from 12.4 percent last year. The percentage of Native American or Native Hawaiian admits decreased to 2.2 percent, down from last year’s 2.6 percent.
Women make up a majority of the admitted class at 51.6 percent; there was gender parity in last year’s admitted class.
The number of admitted students who previously served in the military or indicated an interest in ROTC also grew. This year’s class admitted students include 13 veterans and 47 students interested in ROTC, an increase from six veterans and 41 ROTC prospects last year.
Fitzsimmons said in a Wednesday interview that he believes veterans bring a valuable perspective to campus.
“The difference the veterans make in terms of their interaction with fellow undergraduates is absolutely priceless. We certainly hope that we’re going to see the continued increases,” Fitzsimmons said.
Students from all 50 states and 92 countries earned admission to the Class of 2024. Mid-Atlantic states host the largest percentage of admitted applicants at 22 percent, followed by the South at 19.7 percent, New England at 17.4 percent, Western and Mountain states at 16.9 percent, and the Midwest at 11.9 percent. Twelve percent of the class come from the U.S. territories and abroad.
More than half of admitted students are eligible for financial aid, with an average expected family contribution at $12,000. Further, 23 percent of admitted students’ families would not contribute to the cost of attendance, an increase from 20 percent from the previous class. These students would also receive a $2,000 grant to finance initial expenses like move-in costs.
The percentage of admitted students who are first-generation or low-income increased to 19.4 and 19 percent from last year’s 16.4 and 17 percent, respectively.
The College plans to introduce admitted students to life at Harvard through Virtual Visitas, an online version of the on-campus admitted students weekend that will run for the entire month of April. The on-campus program, originally planned for April 18 through 20, was cancelled earlier this month due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.
In discussing what to expect during Virtual Visitas, Fitzsimmons said faculty and alumni are taking an “all-hands-on-deck” approach to welcoming admitted applicants.
“There are many gatherings alumnae and alumni hold throughout the United States and around the world every year for admitted students. Those are not possible this year,” Fitzsimmons said. “So, alumnae and alumni are going to be doing emails, phone calls, and, in some cases, we’re going to try to get alumnae and alumni to be part of the regular Virtual Visitas.”
Until admissions and financial aid staff are able to return to campus, they will not mail out physical acceptance packets. Admitted applicants have until May 1 to accept or decline their spot in the incoming freshman class.

After receiving the news on March 10 that they and their classmates would be removed from campus due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, hundreds of international students at the College have faced a slew of unpredictable challenges after traveling home.
Representing 155 countries, these students transitioned in a matter of days from packing up their dorm rooms to rapidly booking flights, and finally to arriving home to completely new circumstances.
The Crimson spoke with five such students, each of whom journeyed home to a different country this month, about landing in the middle of their governments’ wide range of responses to the pandemic, from strict limits on leaving their households to mandatory hospital quarantines — and about the unique challenges they say the future holds for them.
Flying through Hong Kong from Boston, a full day’s travel delivered Andrew W. Shen ’23 to a specially-designated terminal in Beijing’s airport — which he described as a “biohazard zone” — filled with workers in protective suits and gear.
Before anyone could disembark, workers selected several passengers for random health inspections, Shen said. Eventually, everyone on his flight completed health survey forms and a travel history questionnaire, and received a temperature check.
In the terminal, the baggage carousels weren’t operating. Luggage was manually disinfected and distributed.
After collecting his luggage, Shen boarded a bus to his district, the vehicle’s every surface encased in plastic and its windows open to increase air circulation, he said. He is currently quarantined at a friend’s vacant apartment to avoid potentially exposing his family to COVID-19.
China has begun to loosen its coronavirus regulations. Shen said his mother and sister were able to go on a field trip a few days ago. He, however, remains under government supervision.
“They installed this little detector thingy that whenever I open my door, it’s going to send a signal back to tell them to open my door,” Shen said. “So I have to record every action. I basically haven’t left my house except for getting tested.”
Other students have faced similarly restrictive experiences, even as Harvard’s classes begin again in earnest, entirely online, after last week’s spring recess.
Ton-Nu Nguyen-Dinh ’22 arrived in Vietnam nine days ago already expecting to be placed in hospital quarantine, she said. The day she arrived home, a government van arrived outside her house to pick her up and drive her to a hospital on the outskirts of Hanoi.
Nguyen-Dinh was confined to a hospital ward bedroom, where she remained quarantined as of Wednesday. She said she receives three meals a day, and her stay and care are free.
“I was prepared for this even before we received the eviction notice. Since the first corona case was discovered in America, Vietnam was already doing quarantine,” Nguyen-Dinh said. “I knew this would happen.”
While Nguyen-Dinh said that her time in quarantine has been “more productive” than it would have been had she been able to spend time with family and friends at home, she also said she has faced serious difficulty focusing on her schoolwork.
“It’s been messing with my ability to concentrate and think critically,” Nguyen-Dinh said. “At school we have all these resources and people, more importantly, that we run into throughout the day. We have interactions and stimulating conversations. None of that is happening anymore.”
“When I try to think critically or to do work, I can’t. It feels like a daydream,” she added. “There’s nothing to ground it. There’s no books, no ritual, no people. We’re not going to school, doing our little hikes, going to classrooms, doing hikes back. There’s no daily rhythm here. It’s weird. It messes with my ability to really ‘be’ in class.”
Though Nguyen-Dinh will be released from quarantine next week, she says she is concerned that something essential about her experience at the College will remain “lost” for the rest of the semester.
“I think that school as we knew it is not existent anymore,” she said.
Remarking upon the drastic measures taken by China and other east Asian countries, Shen said he believes that China’s coronavirus measures have effectively limited the first wave outbreak. Shen observed that while earlier media reports seemed to portray China’s measures as “draconian,” now, countries across the globe are taking similar steps to slow the pandemic.
Germany is one such imitator, tightening social regulations to combat the spread of COVID-19. Similar to “shelter in place” orders in effect in areas across the U.S., restrictions in Germany allow people to leave their homes for essential actions, such as buying groceries or medicine. The country recently imposed police-enforced bans on public gatherings greater than two.
After returning home from Harvard, David A. Paffenholz ’22 said he was tested for COVID-19 in Germany last Tuesday. The results came back negative, he said.
“One thing I think Germany has been particularly good about is testing a lot of people and making that available,” Paffenholz said. “I was actually also tested on Tuesday of last week, I was sick with a bit of a fever. Turned out negative, thankfully, but I was impressed by the organization that they had.”
Paffenholz said he has nonetheless imposed a self-quarantine, being particularly careful to avoid older family members.
Veronica I. Nutting ’21, who landed in Buenos Aires two Saturdays ago, was required to undergo a mandatory quarantine as an international traveler. Because Argentina announced the mandatory quarantine for incoming travelers a few days prior to her departure, Nutting said she felt mentally prepared for the isolation.
According to Nutting, Argentina is “taking a more proactive, preventative approach” to combatting the virus. This includes mandating citizens to remain at home except for exceptional trips to the grocery store or pharmacy.
Argentina has also imposed restrictions on travel beyond a certain radius from each resident’s home. Nutting said that if she wanted to take her dog for a walk, she could only go a limited distance before violating the regulations.
“Something that a lot of my friends in the U.S. are able to do is that here, we are not able to go out for example, to go on a road,” Nutting said. “So it is more strict in that way.”
“I haven’t heard of any super specific cases of escalating too far. But I think people here are being very respectful and following the quarantine,” she added.
Nutting said that quarantine has been “totally okay” for her, adding that she, too, expected “pretty early” in the semester to face restrictions whenever she returned home. But she said she still feels the absence of the stability that Harvard’s setting offers.
“I think I appreciate the way things were much more now,” Nutting said, “And [quarantine] has definitely undermined a sense of stability and certainty that I maybe had two weeks ago, but I think that’s probably for the better.”
While some international students immediately knew what to expect in the wake of the College’s order to leave campus, others reported facing sudden, drastic changes to their travel plans and expectations for the remainder of the semester.
Soon after receiving the notice to vacate, Chihiro Ishikawa ’21 made arrangements to spend the remaining weeks of the spring semester in Connecticut. She left Harvard on Sunday, March 15, and remained at a friend’s house for five days, constantly contacting her family and facing personal doubt as to whether she made the right choice.
“I started worrying that I should return to Japan because I started hearing that travel would be really difficult. I also got to the mental state where I really wanted to see my family again and stay close with them during this time,” Ishikawa said.
After a series of rapid decisions and last-minute bookings, Ishikawa arrived in Japan five days ago. She is currently living with her family and is maintaining self-quarantine in her room. She said she is grateful that her professors have been “flexible” and “caring” throughout the tumult.
“My educators have been really considerate and flexible about class, and in that instance, I’ve been on the extremely lucky side,” Ishikawa said. “We have no shortage of food, I have electricity and wifi, so I’m really grateful for those things and I definitely think that I’m lucky.”
With travels concluded and class resumed, remote learning has posed a flurry of unique challenges for international students living in vastly different time zones and residential situations, they say — from altering class schedules, to communicating with professors, to maintaining mental health.
“I get really overwhelmed coordinating classes with people all over the world. It takes a lot of emails,” Nguyen-Dinh said. “Something I think would be really helpful would be a way for us to be easily in touch with the course staff. Something quick and tangible in order to clear confusion quickly without going through the hassle of emailing to figure out office hours and dates.”
For Paffenholz, who is working six hours ahead in Germany, classes have shifted towards the evening. He says the change hasn’t posed a problem for his schedule, adding that he switched out of a 7 p.m. section which would have met at 1 a.m. his time.
Shen, who is 12 hours ahead of Eastern Time, said he feels fortunate that most of his classes are at 10:30 p.m. his time, allowing him to go to bed by midnight. He added that he does have a few early morning sections, and that attending office hours has been difficult, but that he hopes to be able to manage.
“I do have a 1:30 a.m. section and a 3 a.m. section coming up in the next few days, so we’ll see how that goes,” Shen said. “I think since it’s once or twice a week, I should be fine. But I’m not saying anything is set in stone yet.”
Beyond logistical worries, Nguyen-Dinh said that she “is optimistic” that the “intention” to maintain a sense of community will conquer any mounting stress posed by the experience of taking class from government quarantine.
“It’s productive, I’m able to go to class, but it feels very unreal. I cannot make sense that I’m going to school while sitting in a quarantine bed all day,” Nguyen-Dinh said.
“On the bright side, despite being halfway around the world, I’m still able to keep in touch with my friends,” she added. “We write letters, and call, and send messages. There’s still community. And there’s still an effort to continue the community we had on campus. That’s something that I find really uplifting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard Medical School hosted its annual match day — the day when fourth-year medical school students learn where they will spend their residency — virtually for the first time, responding to heightened concerns about the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Less than a week later, those same students received news that they may be graduating a month early, as part of the effort to bolster the healthcare workforce treating the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients.
In a Wednesday meeting with Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley and deans of medical schools at Boston University, Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders urged schools to graduate fourth-year medical students in April rather than sticking to their typical May graduation dates. Sudders said the state would grant expedited 90-day licenses to these students upon graduation, adding hundreds of additional doctors to the Massachusetts healthcare system.
“The healthcare workforce is key to us,” Sudders said in a press conference with Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79. “We’re trying to increase the cadre.”
Harvard Medical School spokesperson Ekaterina D. Pesheva wrote in an emailed statement that the Medical School is “actively exploring” the option of expedited graduation for students who meet degree requirements.
“This step would allow qualified MD graduates seeking to join the clinical workforce the ability to do so,” Pesheva wrote.
After the conversation with Sudders, Boston University School of Medicine announced Thursday that it would graduate its 192 fourth-year students on April 17.
In a letter to those fourth-year students, Boston University School of Medicine Dean Karen H. Antman wrote that graduates would have the choice of applying for a Massachusetts license or moving to the location of their residencies.
“Your class is clearly graduating at one of the most medically challenging times of the last century, and will shortly be an important part of our country’s response to the COVID-19 challenge,” Antman wrote in the letter. “We are proud of the physicians that you will soon be, and for the role that you will play in the care of your patients.”
Chancellor of UMass Medical School Michael F. Collins said the school intends to graduate 135 fourth-year students in early April, according to the Boston Globe. Tufts University Medical School has also moved its graduation up to April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of students and faculty members from Harvard Medical School created and translated public health materials about the novel coronavirus pandemic into more than 30 languages this week.
Pooja Chandrashekar ’18 — a first-year student at Harvard Medical School, and the founder and director of the COVID-19 Health Literacy Project — started the project after realizing how little information about the pandemic was available in different languages.
“This makes it really difficult for patients with lower health literacy to know when and how to seek care, especially patients from immigrant backgrounds, or from non English speaking communities,” Chandrashekar said.
Since the project’s founding last week, 175 medical students representing more than 30 institutions and speaking a collective 37 languages have contributed.
The project includes seven one-page fact sheets. Three are separately dedicated to information, prevention, and management of the disease; three contain information for children and adolescents; and one focuses on coronavirus and pregnancy.
So far, the sheets have been translated into 34 languages, including Arabic, Hindi, Greek and Vietnamese. Sheets in ten languages are currently online, and the remainder of the translations will become available online soon.
Though medical students performed the majority of the translation work, all the materials were reviewed and vetted — both in English and after translation — by faculty members at the Medical School.
Alexandria Y. Lee — a student at the Harvard School of Public Health who helped translate materials into Mandarin — wrote in an email that thoughts of her grandparents inspired her to work on the project.
“My grandparents are already very good about trying to keep up with the news and health precautions/guidelines during this COVID-19 pandemic, but sometimes the information they get is passed around quickly and not very accurate,” she said. “I hope that by contributing this way that I might be helping other family members who may be nervous about our current situation and better inform them with more accurate information.”
Gabrielle Brauner, a student at Stonybrook University School of Medicine, also had a personal reason to join the project: her father is immunosuppressed and could be at a high risk of complications if he were to contract the virus.
“There is not much I can do about that, besides stay away from him, so I feel useless in that aspect,” she wrote in an email. “Knowing that the effort that I’m putting in may allow people who speak other languages to understand the severity of this virus means a lot to me.”
Edwin “Ned” Palmer — a faculty reviewer for the project and a physician at Boston Children’s Hospital — said the project is key in its ability to communicate a “core nucleus” of information about COVID-19 to a wide audience.
“This is an unprecedented time of crisis, and reassurance of people is built around a core of knowledge and understanding,” he said. “From there, you can have the more detailed conversation to really help people understand why public health interventions matter, why shelter in place is a valuable thing, why your entire life has been disrupted and turned upside down.”
Baruch Krauss — another faculty reviewer from Boston Children’s Hospital — said the project’s three informational sheets targeted towards children fulfill an “unmet need.”
“I thought the project really addressed an unmet need, which was to provide accurate, engaging, and helpful resources to children in an age appropriate way so they can really understand what’s going on,” Krauss said.
Rachel M. Reardon — a Harvard Medical School student who led the efforts to produce materials for children — said that like non-English speakers, children are often “forgotten” in times of crisis.
“A big goal of the Health Literacy Project at large was to think about people who are traditionally marginalized or forgotten, and how important it is that all groups in our society have access to quality, reliable and understandable information,” she said. “Thinking about children is a crucial part of that because I do think that they can be a demographic that is overlooked or forgotten.”
Rachel Conrad — another faculty reviewer — said the project also represents an important tool for medical students who have been removed from clinical care situations to cope with the crisis.
In traumatic situations, Conrad said that staying “active, engaged, connected and motivated” helps to stave off post-traumatic stress and encourage post-traumatic growth.
“It’s really important for their own resilience,” she said.
Deborah Plana — an MD/Ph.D. student at Harvard who helped translate materials into Spanish — said projects like the Health Literacy Project are one way medical students have found to contribute to the fight against COVID-19.
“We’re in the spot where we really want to help as much as we can but we’re kind of unable to do things directly on the front lines, and so there’s been a lot of creative efforts that have come out of the medical school — both at Harvard and across the country — to try to help,” she said.
Plana said that other efforts at the Medical School include fulfilling childcare and food needs for medical professionals and gathering much-needed personal protective equipment, like masks.
As for the Health Literacy Project, just a week after the project began, the fact sheets and translations are already circulating to clinics and having an impact on patients.
“I forwarded the link to my own medical practice so that it could be used for our non-English speaking patients, and I’m confident that is being replicated around the nation,” said Sara B. Fazio, another faculty reviewer.
Harvard Health Publishing — the consumer information division of Harvard Medical School — is also partnering with the project and will publish the translations on its Coronavirus Resource Center, according to its executive editor Nancy Ferrari.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of city and federal officials assured Cambridge business owners that economic relief from the federal government and local programs is on the way at a virtual town hall hosted by city leaders Thursday.
United States Representative Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.), who represents Cambridge in Massachusetts’s fifth congressional district, said she is “very optimistic” that a mammoth $2 trillion stimulus package will be able to pass the House of Representatives by voice vote on Friday, after it was unanimously approved by the Senate late Wednesday night.
“We want to make sure that the federal government is coming in and supporting small businesses, our municipalities, and our states who are really on the front lines of this crisis,” Clark said.
If even one House member objects to the bill on the voice vote, a quorum must be present in order to pass the package, which includes upwards of $370 billion for small businesses. Clark said she plans to travel to Washington, D.C. in order to be on standby in case a quorum is needed to pass the bill.
Clark, along with U.S. Small Business Administration officials Wendell G. Davis and Peter Kontakos, answered questions Cambridge Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon asked on behalf of local small businesses at the teleconference.
Clark stressed that the stimulus package includes a “Paycheck Protection Program” that would provide loans to small businesses at a low interest rate. The government may forgive loans for businesses that use them to cover payroll.
She added that “gig economy” workers — independent contractors such as Uber drivers who are not normally eligible for unemployment — will be able to collect benefits under the proposed bill.
“We are very aware that many people who normally wouldn’t be able to have unemployment insurance are going to be in a position where they will need it,” Clark said.
City officials on the panel also discussed local relief projects. Pardis Saffari, a City of Cambridge economic development manager, discussed a citywide database of all businesses remaining open or transitioning to e-commerce models. Saffari also informed town hall attendees of relief grants to small businesses the city introduced Thursday.
Michael Monestime, executive director of the Central Square Business Improvement District, also introduced a new economic impact report at the town hall. The report, “Grassroots Relief for Main Streets,” highlighted small business owners’ struggles across the Greater Boston area and provided economic relief recommendations.
The Central Square BID, East Cambridge Business Association, and Union Square Main Streets co-published the report on Thursday. Five Cambridge City Councilors, Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, and Mallon signed on to the recommendation in the report.
The report urges the Massachusetts state legislature to adopt relief measures, including an emergency relief fund for small businesses, expanded unemployment benefits, and anti-eviction protections.
Union Square Main Streets president Zachary C. Baum stressed the widespread economic losses surrounding the coronavirus outbreak in a Thursday interview.
“Zero percent of businesses from the Union Square community — zero percent reported that COVID-19 has not had an impact on their business,” Baum said.
Mallon likened current events to the 2008 financial crisis, when Wall Street firms were bailed out by the federal government, but remained steadfast in her commitment to local businesses.
“Main Street got left out, and we can’t have that again,” Mallon said in the town hall.
In spite of a dire economic situation, Nina Berg, communications director for the Central Square BID, said local business associations plan to support proprietors in Cambridge.
“Especially in Cambridge and Central Square, this is our extended family. We’re talking about our friends, restaurants, parents, the places you go to growing up,” Berg said in an interview. “It’s really an effort to support those people who we care about deeply.”

Prospective students from the Harvard Class of 2024 evaluated the impact of the College’s upcoming “Virtual Visitas” — online programming intended to replace the traditional on-campus admitted students weekend, which was canceled in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 announced the move to a Virtual Visitas in an email sent to admitted students earlier this month.
“Admissions and Financial Aid will manage specific larger events, including the president’s welcome, virtual visitas, and a few student/parent panels, but the majority of events are independently organized and produced by faculty, academic centers, and student groups,” College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email.
Students admitted to the Class of 2024 shared their excitement about being able to virtually meet some of their classmates and explore parts of Harvard, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
“I lost the opportunity to meet my class for the first time together before the semester starts,” Kristen A. Harriott, an admitted student, wrote in an email. “But I’m hoping the projected online Visitas may help bridge that gap.”
Melissa Meng, an admitted student, wrote in an email that she thinks the online programming will allow 2024 admits to stick together during such a tumultuous time.
“I think that a Virtual Visitas would pull the class of 2024 closer together,” she wrote. “We are all united by our sadness of not being able to attend Visitas in person, so I know that many of us would reach for the opportunity to replicate something like it virtually.”
The situation has also helped some families — who would otherwise be financially excluded from attending Visitas — engage more in the college decision process.
Taruna Singh, an admitted student, added that “college tours can be difficult to do sometimes because of financial hurdles.”
Other students were less optimistic.
“We would know a little more but won’t be gaining that much of an experience,” Abiba I. Dyuti, an admitted student, wrote in an email. “I think it’s a great alternative to physical tours and it’s a great initiative, but it’s just not the same.”
Kevin Wang, an admitted student, also acknowledged that online interactions can be limited.
“There is really no replacement for the face-to-face opportunities to interact with your future classmates and Harvard institutions and student organizations. I’d say it’s still pretty valuable, though,” he wrote.
Earlier this month, Harvard’s peer institutions made a similar decision to move admitted student programming online.
Stanford and Princeton, in correspondences sent to their own admitted students, said that they are in the process of creating a “compelling virtual experience” and a “robust digital preview program,” respectively.
Communicating with peer institutions is “in the normal course of business,” according to Dane.
Every spring, Harvard welcomes hundreds of admitted students for Visitas. The last time Visitas was canceled was in 2013, when law enforcement officials launched a massive manhunt for one of the two suspects involved in the Boston Marathon bombings.
Despite the challenges of a Virtual Visitas, admits for the Harvard Class of 2024 said they remained determined to get to know each other in any way possible.
“The computer science majors banded together to allow us to host giant video call sessions to meet each other already—our next call being right before Ivy Day,” Harriott wrote.
Christine A. Dela Cruz, an admitted student, said she is trying to meet prospective students through other online venues.
“Despite the hardships in terms of a lack of a physical Visitas, I'm still befriending a lot of people through GroupMe and other social media platforms and we've been holding our own online hangouts, so it's not too bad,” she wrote.
“We’re also all sticking together and maintaining hope, while making the most out of what we can,” Meng added. “So, while the situation is not the most ideal, I wouldn’t give it up for the world.”

The Office of Career Services suspended funding for summer study abroad programs, the office announced in a Monday email to program participants.
OCS wrote that it does not expect to provide any funding for such programs due to the coronavirus pandemic, and encouraged students to consider other summer possibilities.
“Even if an area is categorized as ‘safe’ by the beginning of the summer, many organizations, universities, and employers may not feel ready to host students,” the email read. “We do not anticipate offering any students summer funding for summer 2020, and we recommend that you investigate alternative summer options, online possibilities and opportunities closer to home.”
OCS is a common source of funding for students with international summer plans. Students on financial aid that receive funding from OCS can have the entire cost of their program and airfare covered; students not on financial aid receive $1,500 awards.
The suspension of OCS funding corresponds with University-wide policies prohibiting all Harvard-related international air travel and all non-essential domestic air travel.
OCS director Robin Mount wrote in an email to The Crimson that the office decided to suspend funding for Harvard Summer School study abroad programs due to the uncertainty surrounding coronavirus and international travel.
“Given that study abroad programs are logistically and operationally complex and require significant advanced planning, and due to the travel restrictions, the unpredictable nature of the spread of the virus, and to ensure the safety of faculty, students, and program administrators, Harvard Summer School made the difficult decision to suspend summer 2020 study abroad programs,” Mount wrote.
Ava M. Hampton ’21 called the move “disruptive” to her summer plans, but also said she understands the decision. Hampton — who would have studied in four cities in Greece, including Athens, Nafplio, Olympia, and Thessaloniki — also said the prospects of finding an opportunity in her field of interest, arts administration, is slim.
“The advice that they’ve given us is look for things nearby or things online,” she said. “And there aren’t really a whole lot of internships in my field in my area. So it’s difficult to know, without funding, whether I will be able to get anything because the opportunities are pretty limited nearby.”
Naomi Davy ’22 said she will no longer be able to attend a summer program in Aix-en-Provence, France, due to the loss of funding. Davy also said she planned traveling abroad during her sophomore summer far in advance, and that the situation “throws a wrench” in her plans.
“Originally, when I found out that I got this program fully funded, I had planned to go, so I didn’t apply for anything else,” she said. “I’m not sure how far I can travel or what sorts of businesses will be open, so it’s kind of all up in the air right now.”

As COVID-19 cases in the United States skyrocket and the health care system prepares to absorb the shock, Harvard University Health Services is working to adjust its services to keep both staff and patients healthy.
As of Thursday evening, 24 Harvard affiliates – including University President Lawrence S. Bacow – reported testing positive for COVID-19, according to an HUHS website. HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen said these cases include only those that have been confirmed by lab results. HUHS asks University affiliates to self-report positive test results.
“We’re relying on the self report of our patients, who reach out to us and let us know. And actually the majority of the tests that are being reported in these numbers are people who have been tested elsewhere,” Nguyen said.
Roger L. Shapiro, an infectious disease physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said in the last two weeks, he has had to perform more clinical duties at the hospital, which is beginning to see a significant increase in COVID-19 patients.
More than 2,400 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Massachusetts as of Thursday evening, including more than 160 hospital workers in Boston. Shapiro said that though what will happen in the coming weeks is unknown, Boston hospitals are preparing to deal with a surge in patients.
“We are probably a little behind New York City [in terms of current cases]. And I hope that we don’t have the same level of intensity of that first wave of patients,” Shapiro said. “It’s getting very, very busy. But so far, it appears we are staying on top of things, and able to keep up.”
“I can’t speak for what the situation will be like in one or two weeks — it’s really an unknown right now,” he added.
According to Nguyen, HUHS is taking its own precautions as well as following statewide guidance from government and public health officials. Though healthcare workers are considered essential and therefore exempt from the stay-at-home order issued by Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, Nguyen said HUHS is still trying to implement measures to reduce the amount of staff at its facilities.
“We have been doing everything possible to ensure de-densification of our facilities,” Nguyen said. “We’re only bringing in a small number of people at a time. People are going to be taking shifts to do that work so that we can minimize the density of staff who are present on-site.”
In order to compensate for decreased in-person services, HUHS began virtual care last week, primarily over the phone. HUHS is still in the process of transitioning to using video for clinical services because it first has to make sure that the service is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
“It took quite some time to go through the legal channels to create a new business agreement with Zoom that is specific to the privacy needs and then also to make sure that all of the protocols are in place to do it in a way that we can ensure not only safety, but also appropriate documentation,” Nguyen said.
Chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services Barbara Lewis said individual CAMHS sessions are available over the phone and clinicians are working to re-establish virtual group sessions once HUHS is able to use Zoom to provide services.
Lewis said providers have been quick to adjust to the transition to virtual services, which were announced to clinicians last Monday and took effect just two days later.
Sarah M. Fortune, Chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the School of Public Health, said mental health services are particularly important during this “anxiety producing time.”
Some students and clinicians are facing challenges with the transition, however. There are students and clinicians who struggle to find quiet, private places at home and clinicians who now have to look after their children during the day. Lewis said that some solutions to these issues include going for walks during sessions for privacy and or holding sessions outside of traditional hours.
HUHS vets patients from afar before deciding whether in-person services are necessary.
Harvard affiliates who are still on campus are asked to contact HUHS if they suspect they may have COVID-19 to determine whether they need to break quarantine and seek in-person medical attention.
“The act of going in terms of transiting themselves from home to a doctor’s office puts people at risk in the course of their transit to the office and also potentially puts other people at risk when they arrive in the office as well,” Nguyen said. “We want to make sure that folks are coming in only when it is absolutely necessary.”
Nguyen said HUHS will continue to adapt to the constantly changing situation.
“Even if you think about the way we deal with one particular clinical situation two weeks ago and compare that to how we might deal with it today, it might be very different,” he said. “And how we deal with it maybe a week and a half from now will be very different.”

Harvard Kennedy School professor David J. Deming discussed the epidemiological and economic impacts of COVID-19 in an online webinar Thursday afternoon with nearly 200 attendees.
Deming, the faculty director of the Wiener Center for Social Policy at the Kennedy School, based his talk on existing research on the disease’s symptoms, its economic consequences, and efforts to minimize its spread across the globe.
He credited the danger of COVID-19 to its high mortality rate and tendency to be asymptomatic — factors that are exacerbated by the lack of adequate testing, irresponsible social behavior, and insufficient medical supplies in many countries around the world.
“Like everyone else, I was really anxious about what was going on,” Deming said in an interview before the webinar. “I lived through the recession, I lived through 9/11, and this is the most traumatic thing that’s ever happened in my memory.”
Deming stressed the importance of testing throughout his talk, noting that testing in the United States falls short when compared to that of other developed countries.
“We were not only not testing people, we were only testing people who had severe symptoms. But also, the CDC required that in order to be administered a test, you had to have a known connection to someone who tested positive,” Deming said.
“It is sort of a catch-22 because if you don’t test anybody, you don’t know where the connections are,” he added.
Deming also discussed the main symptoms of COVID-19, which range from a dry cough to severe pneumonia, and compared the disease’s mortality rate to that of seasonal influenza.
“Is this more deadly than the flu? The answer is yes, it’s much more deadly than the flu,” Deming said.
COVID-19 has an estimated 2.3 percent mortality rate — though the rate differs greatly among age groups — compared to a 0.1 percent mortality rate for seasonal influenza.
During a question and answer session after the presentation, one attendee asked whether public health would receive more attention in the future.
“If history is a guide, we probably will learn the narrow lesson, which is we need to be more prepared for a global pandemic, but we will probably not learn the broader lesson, which is that the world is highly uncertain and unpredictable things can happen,” Deming said.
As the pandemic continues to spread across the world, Deming emphasized the importance of immediate action in “flattening the curve.”

“I just hope and pray, honestly, that we can pull that off in the U.S. and in every other nation in the world,” he said. “I think it’s urgent — it makes the difference between 100,000 people and a million people dying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists argued that the novel coronavirus outbreak makes democratic participation especially important during the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics’ inaugural “Fast Forum” Thursday evening.
Congressman and Chair of the House Rules Committee James P. McGovern (D-Mass.) and co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund and a fall 2019 IOP Resident Fellow LaTosha Brown discussed how lawmakers and activists are responding to the coronavirus outbreak. IOP director Mark D. Gearan ’78 moderated the 30-minute conversation, which was held on Zoom for Harvard affiliates and live-streamed on Facebook and YouTube for the general public.
“Even in the midst of this crisis, while it’s really important for us to address the financial issues and the financial crisis, democracy delay is dangerous. So we have to be just as diligent around protecting democracy in this moment. Matter of fact, I believe even more so,” Brown said.
Given that social distancing makes it harder for people to vote in person, the two speakers highlighted the need for increased accessibility to voting, through methods such as absentee ballots and early voting.
“We need to make sure that the people can vote and that everybody who’s eligible to vote has that right to vote,” McGovern said.
The coronavirus outbreak has also posed challenges to voting within Congress. McGovern — who was commissioned by Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to deliver a report on these issues — explained the constitutional, logistical, and security problems with remote voting in Congress.
“Technology’s imperfect, so if we do something like this for a debate and vote in Congress, if the Russians or the Iranians or the Chinese wanted to mess around with us, they could block some of our communication and make us look incompetent,” McGovern said.
“The second thing is, we have members of Congress, some of whom are very technologically advanced, some who are not,” he added. “We have a lot of members of Congress who still have used flip phones, so this technology is a very intimidating thing for many of them.”
When a student asked about the “bright spots” that can be seen from this crisis, McGovern said he has been moved by “the goodness in the American people” as ordinary citizens support each other during the pandemic.
Brown concluded the conversation by highlighting the potential for healthcare reform in this moment.
“I’m hoping that this health crisis allows us to really examine that 32 million people are without health insurance, that we realize how interdependent we are as human beings, that the health of somebody else actually impacts the health of us, so that we can have a real dialogue and a more open dialogue around healthcare in this country,” Brown said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students dispersed by the coronavirus pandemic complete their first week of online classes, faculty say they have faith in the College’s Honor Code to guard against the temptation of mid-exam Googling.
Several instructors have chosen to shift remaining exams in their course from closed-book to open-book, allowing students to consult textbooks and notes during the assessment. For example, the final exam in the course Statistics 171: “Introduction to Stochastic Processes” is now open-note and open-book.
Economics professor Christopher L. Foote said he decided to administer solely open-note assessments for the remainder of his course, Economics 1010b: “Intermediate Macroeconomics,” due to the technical challenge of asking his approximately 240 students to install exam proctoring software on their computers.
“Aside from the technical challenges of making sure that that software ran for everybody on their home computers no matter where they are, I just didn’t think it was appropriate to sort of introduce that level of intrusion of technological intrusion into the test taking process,” he said.
Foote added that he chose to rely on the College’s Honor Code in trusting students not to consult with others about their exam answers.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins similarly said he decided to change the final exam of his course Economics 3116: “Seminar in Environmental Economics and Policy” to a three-hour-long open-book exam.
“In my experience, the vast majority of students at Harvard demonstrate very high levels of academic integrity, but making the exam closed-book at remote settings, without opportunities for monitoring and enforcement, could lead to inequities among students,” Stavins wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Instead of instituting format changes, some instructors have chosen to proctor their online exams. Government professor Stephen Chaudoin wrote in an email that his teaching team supervised an online, closed book exam via Zoom for his course Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation”.
Chaudoin said more than half of his students had already taken the exam in person when it was originally scheduled on March 10, less than two hours after the College’s notice to evacuate. For that reason, he felt it was most equitable to give the remaining students a similar, closed book exam.
“I would consider doing another closed-book, online exam. I thought it went pretty well,” he wrote. “In International Relations, when people talk about arms control, they sometimes say ‘Trust but verify.’ The same applies here. We have to trust the students, and the online exam tools give us a partial way to monitor things.”
Chaudoin said he used an online proctoring protocol developed by the Office of Undergraduate Education. Spanish 20: “Intermediate Spanish: Language and Culture in the Hispanic World” will also use this protocol for closed-book exams, according to its updated syllabus.
“If you feel a closed-book, timed exam is important in your course, you can hold one in Zoom,” the protocol reads. “Students will set up their webcams to give you and your teaching fellows a view of their workspace while they work on the test.”
The OUE, however, generally discourages online proctored exams, according to the document.
“It is the recommendation of the OUE to try to adapt your assessments to use methods that do not require a closed-book proctored exam,” the protocol begins.
Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Robert A. Lue, the faculty director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, said he thinks it is essential for faculty to exercise trust in students.
“I have urged every colleague that will really listen to me — and the Bok Center has made this explicit — that we think it’s better at this sort of specific moment in time to focus on the Honor Code and not get bogged down in what can be rather complicated proctoring scenarios,” he said.
As courses have transitioned online, other instructors have echoed their faith in the College’s Honor Code, which asks students to sign a statement affirming their commitment to academic integrity.
Foote said he believes professors’ “default setting” should be confidence in students’ ability to conduct themselves with academic integrity — even during crises like the current coronavirus pandemic.
“Do I think that some students in the United States higher educational system have cheated? Yeah,” he said. “But I also think that professors should trust students to do the right thing and it improves the learning atmosphere for everybody involved.”
David Dockterman, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in the Technology, Innovation, and Education program, said emphasizing individual growth rather than competition is key to helping students maintain integrity.
“You’re trying to do a quick culture shift that has a higher focus on learning and learning how to learn in a new environment, rather than on competing for grades,” he said.
Despite course changes and exam supervision experiments, at least one aspect of the College’s cheating enforcement will persist: the College’s Honor Council — which adjudicates Honor Code violations — will continue to hear cases.
Allison J. Piper ’20, a student academic integrity fellow, said the dispersal will not significantly impact the Council’s work.
Honor Council voting member Taimur M. Kouser ’20 agreed, adding that, while the council will have to adapt its in-person outreach activities, its members remain dedicated to promoting and enforcing academic integrity.
“The Harvard community is dispersed, but it’s still intact,” Kouser said. “And so our commitment to the educational mission of the College and the values that we hold when pursuing that knowledge — being academically honest in our work even beyond just education — remains the same.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard College students, financial costs mounted as they raced to pack their belongings and vacate their dorms after the threat of the coronavirus outbreak led to their abrupt eviction earlier this month.
In response, Harvard alumni stepped up with offers of support. Experts say, however, their willingness to donate may not last.
In a March 13 email to alumni, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee wrote that some alumni had expressed an interest in aiding students and offered them a portal through which to donate.
“We have also heard from many alumni asking how to support students financially during this transition,” he wrote. “If you want to help in this way, you can make an immediate-use gift designated to areas of greatest need at the College. Contributions will be deployed immediately to support our students during this time of transition.”
After Pinney L. Allen ’76 saw Lee’s email, she said that she and her husband Charles C. Miller ’74 donated to the fund for “areas of greatest impact.” She also wrote to the Development Office asking how else they could support first-generation students.
“While individual health at this time is obviously the primary concern for all of us, one of the most profound and long lasting outcomes of the COVID-19 crisis will be the economic dislocation that follows and its impact on the life trajectory of Harvard’s first generation college students, many of whom may be called on to abandon their Harvard education to support their families,” Allen wrote in an email.
“We must work hard to make sure the hope and possibility they represent is not quashed; the call to support these students and their families must be loud and clear,” she added.
Alumni have donated thousands of dollars to help students meet certain costs, per University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy.
To help alleviate the unexpected financial burdens of the move, Harvard College’s Financial Aid Office subsidized travel and storage for financial aid recipients.
College students with a financial aid package that does not require a parent contribution will be fully reimbursed for travel costs. Other students on financial aid will be reimbursed up to $750 — depending on their level of aid — with exceptions made on a case-by-case basis. The College will also provide up to $200 to assist students on financial aid with costs incurred by shipping or storing items.
Hundreds of alumni also offered personal assistance with housing and storage, while a few even showed up to campus to offer-in person help, per Hennessy.
Hennessy wrote that the University is “deeply grateful” to alumni who have supported students during this time.
“We are also deeply grateful to our alumni, who have reached out to support students and the Harvard community, and who are working tirelessly to support their local communities around the world as teachers, healthcare providers and first responders, scientists, researchers, administrators, and business owners, as we all work together in this critical public health effort,” he wrote.
Despite donations, as the national and global financial situation has worsened, experts say that philanthropy may suffer in the long term.
Christian Lundblad — a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — wrote in an email that the economic downturn triggered by coronavirus could result in “a reduced propensity for alumni and other external constituents (both large and small) to give to the university as they face their own financial constraints.”
Hennessy wrote that philanthropy “critically supports” the University’s mission.
“Philanthropy critically supports Harvard’s teaching, learning, and research mission,” he wrote. “Currently, we see the real impact of this support in enabling critical research; public health diagnostics and tracing; vaccine testing; crisis and policy expertise; economic forecasting; technology support; and innovation and discovery across the schools.”
Allen said that she harbors “competing” sentiments about charitable giving during a time of financial uncertainty, acknowledging that the downturn will likely hit her own finances “very hard.” Still, she said, she feels an obligation to give.
“I feel both a need to be cautious in my own giving, and at the same time, a need to remain open to giving and to do it in ways that will really help in some important ways,” Allen said. She noted she likely would not make a “really large gift” at this time.
Philanthropic contributions across industries stand to decrease at times of economic crisis. A 2012 study from researchers at Stanford University showed that 2008's Great Recession resulted in significant declines in charitable giving, totalling a 10.9 percent decrease between 2007 and 2010.
The coronavirus crisis has already taken a particular toll on the higher education industry, forcing colleges and universities nationwide to send students home, switch to remote learning, and reimburse fees for room and board, among other changes.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, Harvard’s Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister said the pandemic will take a toll on all of higher education.
“Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the financial health of the higher education industry was under stress as evidenced by recent closures and mergers of schools,” Hollister told the Gazette. “The pandemic will put an additional, enormous strain on the industry.”
The United States Senate passed a $2 trillion stimulus package Wednesday that allocated roughly $14 billion for colleges and universities.
Hollister acknowledged that Harvard is “relatively well resourced” compared to other universities.
Allen said she hoped alumni could donate to aid the school but acknowledged that the University “will probably have to cut back on some things.”
“I hope that we can — particularly in the case of Harvard — that alumni can step up and provide the resources that are going to be needed,” Allen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High school junior Cole P. Anderson has worked for years to improve his game in the hopes of joining an elite men’s basketball program like Harvard’s. But as it shuts down sports nationwide, the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted his and many other athletes’ plans.
Anderson, who has communicated with Harvard’s coaching staff about prospectively playing for its program, will not be able to tour Harvard’s campus or meet with Harvard players and coaches this spring due to a rule passed earlier this month by the National Collegiate Athletics Association that prohibits all in-person recruiting until April 15 due to the public health crisis.
The Fresno, Calif. native said not being able to visit Harvard makes it difficult for him to know what it would be like to attend the College.
“It’s hard for me because Harvard’s so far away from where I live, so I don’t have really an idea of what it’s like there,” he said.
As a result of the NCAA’s rule, this spring thousands of high school athletes across the country will not tour campuses or meet with coaches — information-gathering events that help student-athletes decide where they want to go to further their academic and athletic careers.
Though prospective student-athletes go through Harvard’s admission process in the fall of their senior year of high school, many settle on a dream program months in advance.
Another high school junior who has communicated with Harvard men’s basketball, who requested anonymity because of the confidential nature of the recruiting process, said the moratorium on in-person recruiting does not affect his desire to play basketball at Harvard.
The student said he would like to attend a college that is both academically rigorous and athletically competitive. Despite the missed chance to visit Cambridge this spring, he said he does not need to go on an official visit to know that Harvard boasts strong academics as well as one of the top basketball programs in the Ivy League.
Still, recruiting visits can have value. Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy T. Delaney-Smith said she believes athletes who have joined her program valued in-person recruiting events.
“They care about the name of Harvard, but they care more about the relationships that their instincts tell them they’re gonna have with the coaching staff and with players and that’s not going to be easy for them to figure that out,” she said.
Delaney-Smith called recruiting during the global pandemic “the great frontier.”
“There’s a lot of unknowns,” she said. “From our vantage point of having to evaluate them, we know who we want. It’s their job to figure out the differences between all their choices. And that vehicle’s been taken away.”
Delaney-Smith said her program is coming up with new ways to connect with recruits. The team unveiled a social media campaign that spotlights different aspects of the program each day, including “Takeover Tuesdays” where student-athletes post videos capturing a day in their life to the team’s official Instagram account. Delaney-Smith also said she has recently spoken on the phone with all of her recruits and is considering conducting virtual home visits on Zoom.
Some recruits are also trying to familiarize themselves with different schools from afar. Anderson said he is researching different schools’ programs and their student life online.
Since the pandemic has brought nearly all athletic competitions across the world to a halt, Anderson added that he hopes he can showcase his talent in front of scouts again soon.
“Everyone works all year round just for this certain time period of their career, and this is going to be my last [Amateur Athletic Union] season to really prove myself to all these coaches,” he said. “So I’m just hoping that I can keep — that I can get on the court one last time and show what I’ve been working for.”

Harvard will guarantee regular pay and benefits through May 28 for University employees who are available to work but cannot perform their regular duties due to the novel coronavirus outbreak,  Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced in an email Friday afternoon.
The policy will cover all Harvard employees, including full-time, part-time contingent, and contracted workers, Lapp wrote in her email to University’s administrative deans and vice presidents. The policy also extends to any employee whose normal workflow was disrupted after the March 10 announcement that the University would move classes online.
Additionally, Lapp wrote that the University would provide a “financial stabilization package” to the six independent childcare centers on Harvard’s campus, enabling the centers to continue operating through June 2020. The move will guarantee employment for around 180 employees who work at the centers, which typically serve 380 families in the Boston and Cambridge area.
“For our workforce, who each day are so critical to the success of this institution, this unprecedented public health emergency has created innumerable challenges,” University Executive Vice President Katie Lapp wrote in the announcement. “The steps I share today are aimed and providing greater certainty for them in these uncertain times with regards to their pay and benefits, and greater stability for them and their families.”
The announcement comes after many campus facilities shut down as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Since asking students not to return to campus after Spring Break, President Lawrence S. Bacow and 23 other Harvard affiliates have tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease.
University employees subsequently switched to a work-from-home system as most research labs, libraries, and other academic facilities closed. Harvard initially agreed to guarantee 30 days of paid leave with benefits to employees whose workplaces closed and who could not work remotely.
Working conditions and compensation benefits have come under scrutiny amid the pandemic, with some of the University’s subcontracted employees, such as security guards, criticizing the University for not extending them the same emergency benefits as workers directly employed by Harvard. The Labor and Employment Action Project, a student advocacy organization at Harvard Law School, launched a petition which garnered more than 7,000 signatures asking the University to provide all Harvard employees full compensation for the remainder of the semester.
According to Friday’s announcement, the University will also provide pay and benefits to subcontracted employees working in dining, custodial, and security positions who cannot fulfill their contract assignments or obtain new assignments amid the coronavirus public health crisis from March 10 to May 28.
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents around 5,000 employees across campus, has been in ongoing talks with the University over the coronavirus’ impacts on its members, according to HUCTW President Carrie Barbash. Barbash wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s decision serves as an example of “good citizenship” as an employer during a difficult time for workers across the country.
Representatives from other campus unions also said they appreciated Harvard’s efforts to provide for its contracted workers in the midst of uncertain economic conditions and an unprecedented health crisis.
Harvard’s custodial workers and security officers are represented by 32BJ SEIU, a regional branch of the Service Employees International Union. Vice President Roxana Rivera wrote in an emailed statement that union members “applaud Harvard for doing the right thing.”
“Having access to pay and healthcare benefits will give the 1,000 cleaners and security officers we represent at Harvard peace of mind knowing they can stay safe and healthy while continuing to feed their families,” Rivera wrote. “These workers have been at the frontlines of fighting this virus, keeping the campus clean and safe even as students are sent home, and we’re glad that Harvard is acknowledging their important service.”
UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers, also “commends” the University’s decision, according to President Carlos Aramayo.
"We call on all other UNITE HERE Local 26 employers to follow Harvard and compensate their food service and hotel workers during this crisis,”  Aramayo wrote in an emailed statement. “Nothing can reopen until we tackle this public health crisis head-on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost as soon as Harvard College announced Friday that it would adopt a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system this semester, undergraduates variously responded with elation, relief, and fury at the change.
The new grading system mandates that all undergraduates receive grades of either “Emergency Satisfactory” or “Emergency Unsatisfactory” in their spring classes, according to emails sent Friday by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh. Faculty may supplement this terminology with a “qualitative assessment of student learning” in my.harvard.
The decision follows two weeks of heated debate among undergraduates about how the College should adjust its grading policies to accommodate students negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
A satisfactory grade is the equivalent of a C-minus letter grade or higher and does not factor into students’ grade point average, per FAS policies. An unsatisfactory grade, however, is considered a failing grade and is folded into GPA calculations.
Nearly a dozen undergraduates interviewed by The Crimson about the new grading policy expressed wide-ranging reactions to the College’s decision. They each cited different personal circumstances and opinions about what Harvard should prioritize more broadly as it seeks to adapt grading policies to a semester unlike any other.
Benjamin I. Sorkin ’20 said he was “heartened” to hear about Harvard’s decision to implement a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system, which he said would address student concerns about educational equity.
Sorkin said he believes the policy would help equalize disparities between more privileged students able to obtain high letter grades while studying far from campus and students who cannot due to certain disadvantages. He cited a number of obstacles the latter group might face: a lack of internet access, different time zones, additional family responsibilities, health concerns, and lost income from campus employment.
“A universal SAT-UNSAT policy ensures that students who need accommodations are not disadvantaged compared to students who are capable of getting a letter grade and doing well in a letter grade course,” Sorkin said. “It removes the stigma of taking a SAT-UNSAT class if everyone is doing SAT-UNSAT.”
However, some students said they believe the new grading system unfairly discounts students who have already put significant effort into earning a high letter grade this semester. They also argued the system especially harms two groups at opposing stages of their college careers — first generation, low-income freshmen who had a difficult transition into college and seniors seeking postgraduate opportunities.
Several undergraduates circulated a petition on Friday that opposes the new policy for this reason across House email lists, sparking email threads complete with memes about the grading controversy. But, almost as soon as that petition went live, another group of students began a counter-effort titled “Petition against the Students who created a petition against the new policy: y’all selfish.”
Sierra M. Moore ’20 said she signed the first petition because some students like herself require letter grades to reach a certain GPA threshold for graduate school applications. Moore said she believes students should have the option to opt-out of the satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system.
“I think that giving students the freedom to decide what's best for them in their academic plan is the right move for the College to make,” she said. “I think just having this system forced upon us has been unfair.”
Gay wrote in an email to faculty Friday morning that administrators believe a universal grading system is necessary because graduate and fellowship programs have indicated that they would only accept non-letter grades if such grades were instituted for all students.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that a semester of satisfactory-unsatisfactory grades in lieu of a semester of straight A’s will only minimally affect students’ GPAs.
“For more than 90 percent of our students, the impact on overall GPA would be less than 0.10 points. Grades of SEM and UEM will factor into GPA just as the standard SAT (satisfactory) and UNS (unsatisfactory) grades do,” she wrote. “That is, SEM will not factor into GPA, but UEM will.”
Other students said they oppose the new satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system because they argue it insufficiently addresses concerns about how inconsistencies in grading by different professors would underscore differences in students’ resources and living situations.
Undergraduate Council representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22 proposed an act for the council to endorse a universal pass system during a Wednesday meeting. The piece of legislation ultimately passed.
“Many parts of students’ lives have been put in complete jeopardy, and a SAT-UNSAT system still creates a hierarchy that I think in these times simply should not exist,” Jordan said. “Students should not be failing in a national emergency.”
Samyra C. Miller ’21 defended the new grading system, citing her belief that a universal pass grading model could lead to larger-scale educational inequity between universities. She argued allowing all Harvard students to universally pass their courses would offer them an unfair advantage over students of other universities that did not implement such a policy.
“If someone really cares about educational equity, that should also extend outside the realm of Harvard, considering that all these other universities had already announced their policies and none of them had done universal pass,” Miller said.
As disputes about the new grading system have flared up across Harvard email lists and group chats, Abigail R. Lockhart-Calpito ’23 said she appreciated Harvard’s acknowledgment of the unprecedented circumstances students are facing and encouraged compassion among College students.
“If we're at Harvard and we're learning to be student leaders and student advocates, we need to be compassionate to those who are vulnerable right now,” Lockhart-Calpito said. “We need to realize that our peers are vulnerable and that it's not always all about our own GPAs.”

Now that we’re all adjusting to Zoom University, one of the things we miss most (besides Science Center Hall B, of course) are the endless study spaces on campus. With parents and siblings running around the living areas, it can be hard to mimic that trademark Widener silence and get your work done. Check out these tips below if a virtual Lamont Zoom background just isn’t cutting it for you.
Set aside separate workspaces
Every single person says this, and while it may be overused, it’s all too true. While it may be tempting to log onto Zoom while in bed, you’ll only get more distracted. Set up a separate room or table to work at and while you are working there, try to avoid social media (warning: especially TikTok!) and replicate the workspace association that Widener commands. If you want to procrastinate, relocate to another place but make sure to keep your work and phone separate.
Take deserved breaks
There’s nothing you miss more than your 9 a.m. walk from Mather to Northwest Labs, and with a bit of social distancing, there’s no reason why you can’t enjoy the same mental break at home (during a more reasonable hour, of course). Got an extra 15 minutes to kill before your next class? Luckily for you, Spring weather is finally beginning to arrive. A breath of fresh air will leave you refreshed before your next class and ready to face yet another day of technical difficulties.
Put your best foot forward… literally.
As much as rolling out of bed and watching lectures without pants on is enjoyable – let’s be honest, it’s terrible for productivity. To start a productive day off right, put on the clothes you would normally wear to class and make sure to put on your shoes! The feeling of wearing shoes strangely snaps you into work mode instead of lounge-in-my-house-and-binge-Netflix mode.
Go to office hours
The worst thing is when you look up from your phone and that pset that could have been done five hours ago hasn’t even gotten started. Meanwhile, you’ve watched all of Charli D’Amelio’s TikToks three times over. Go to office hours to not only implement some structure in your day, but also to force yourself to dedicate a certain amount of time to a class, even if you don’t have questions.
We don’t know about you, but these days, productivity can be a real issue. Hopefully these tips inject some productivity into all of our days. And hey, if these tips don’t end up working out, hopefully a universal pass/fail will save us all.
