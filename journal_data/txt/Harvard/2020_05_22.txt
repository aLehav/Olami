After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mother speaks a broken English. Her words sail from her lips with misaligned subjects and verbs, mistaken pronunciations, and uncertainty, but while imperfect, they are never whispered. It is from her language, the pages of books partially-read, and the clever comebacks of black girls, that I craft a personal patois: my runway for unashamed flights of discovery, inquiry, and spilling of tea.
Before I carried them to Harvard, nothing ever suggested my words were malnourished. However, in my first weeks around tables in Annenberg, my classmates craved validation by referencing obscure books I had never consumed and using drawn-out words I found to be flavorless. I had always been a chicken-tenders for every meal type of girl, but each syllable was a well-done steak I hated to chew before I swallowed. Their letter counts were obese, every pound a campus-wide indicator of intelligence.
I thought my seat at the table was a mistake. Slowly, my contributions faded to silence. As a child of immigrants, hesitation is a familiar tradition. I have seen my mother’s Creole cross borders and take detours, attempting to decode the unfamiliar bends and turns of tongues in a land unknown. A voice cultivated on American soil was the greatest gift she thought she could give me. However, despite learning my alphabet domestically, the intricate ABCs of Harvard’s campus culture is still foreign and built a wall to keep out my understanding, extinguishing any fire sparked by my creativity.
In a class, the teaching fellow asks about black distrust and my classmates quote essays and manifestos from memory. My lived experience stands small in the shadow of theories by Socrates or Friedman. I don’t share the memories flooded with the smell of tea-tree oil or the tickles of Xpressions braiding hair that always accompany the theories of government conspiracy that my hairdresser shares with me each time I sit in her chair. Her hands cramp from hours of detangling the remnants of false promises and undercover injustice from the scalps of her people, and my tender head fights back tears between gossip and laughs every visit.
My courses harp on the importance of a “scholarly tone.” I wrestle with my keyboard as I struggle to follow the rhythms of scholarship whose sophisticated tongue is attached to a white face. It moves in pointed, rigid, white supremacist motions. I yearn for the circular shimmies and turnt up twists of colloquialisms.
The Queen’s English was never meant to address its subjects. Professors pace back and forth, wandering through dissections of inequality, racism, and all the phobias. I sit restlessly in class, feeling the fully formed braids that tickle my back, and fight to maintain ownership of these stories now camouflaged by language inaccessible to my hairdresser, my mother, and my community. I try to rebirth and redefine our history within the contexts of my books and lectures and to find space within my people’s tradition for a remixed language that is both broken and Harvardesque.
A semester passes and around the tables in Annenberg, the scars in my English have begun to heal. When I return home to touch up the new growth along the edges of my hairline and catch up on my mother’s tales, she hears my new carefully poised words and notes how neatly they fold into my mouth. My growing casual use of words three or more syllables in length leaves my patois unfamiliar to the tongues I so desperately want to protect, but it matriculates effortlessly into the conversations of my new friends who read big books and use a lot of commas. There is no trace of the words my mother once gifted me. As she sits perched on her salon chair throne, proudly boasting about her crimson blessings, she silently wonders if it is worth her child sounding like a stranger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The World Bank named Harvard Kennedy School professor Carmen M. Reinhart its new chief economist Wednesday amid predictions of a prolonged global recession.
Reinhart, whose appointment will take effect June 15, is the World Bank’s third chief economist in three years. Yale economist Pinelopi “Penny” K. Goldberg left the Bank in March after succeeding Paul M. Romer, who resigned in 2018.
Reinhart will also serve as the first Latinx person to hold the position.
“I was born in Cuba and came as a refugee to the United States when I was 10 years old,” she said in an interview with The Crimson. “That kind of experience colors everything in your life, so perhaps in that regard, I've been exposed to the kinds of uncertainty and risk that a lot of people have not experienced.”
At the Kennedy School, Reinhart teaches a course that focuses on financial crises. She will take a two-year leave from Harvard to tackle her new post at the Bank.
In the 1980s, Reinhart served as Senior Policy Advisor and Deputy Director at the International Monetary Fund and chief economist of the investment bank Bear Stearns. She has also served on advisory panels for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Congressional Budget Office.
Reinhart said she hopes her broad range of experiences will help her at the World Bank.
“A lot of my work has been dealing with currency crises, banking crises, debt crises, economic crashes. Every single one of those is present in this [COVID-19] crisis, which has a superarching health crisis,” Reinhart said. “Having that is a broad range of experiences that I hope will be useful in helping me do my job at the Bank.”
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in an interview that Reinhart is one of the world’s leading experts on international financial issues.
“Even when times are good, that is such an important area of expertise that she has been sharing with me and faculty colleagues and all of her students,” Elmendorf said. “But of course it’s a particularly important expertise in bad times.”
As the World Bank’s chief economist, Reinhart will be in charge of guiding the Bank’s intellectual leadership and shaping the economic research agenda of the institution. Amid a global recession, Reinhart says her main job will be “putting out fires.”
“The first priority is for countries to be able to respond to the needs arising from a health emergency,” Reinhart said.
She emphasized that even though the pandemic has prompted a recession, it remains primarily a health crisis.
“The biggest concern with resuming activity, unless it is done with all the suggested precautions is the fear of a second wave,” she said. “As long as you know that the COVID is out there circulating, you know, restoration of normality is not in the cards.”
Elmendorf said Reinhart’s experience at the Kennedy School will likely influence her time at the World Bank.
“Carmen’s global expertise has made her very interesting for her students, but also their questions for her, and their comments in response to things she says in class, have been informative for her, I’m sure,” Elmendorf said.
“It’s very natural for the World Bank to want her to come and help save the world now, but we will miss her being around campus over the next few years,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A student filed a $5 million dollar class action lawsuit against Harvard Wednesday alleging the University provided inadequate education after sending students home due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The student — referred to only as “Student A” — sued the University in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts Wednesday for breach of contract on behalf of themself and their peers, demanding a refund of tuition and fees for “in-person educational services, facilities, access and/or opportunities that Defendant has not provided.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in March that the University would transition to online learning following spring break as a result of the global pandemic. Since then, students have expressed discontentment with the grading model of the online semester, the inequities posed by online learning, and the inability to participate in extracurriculars.
Student A’s complaint alleges Harvard’s online learning options have been “subpar” due to a lack of adequate facilities, materials, and access to faculty. Citing the difference in cost for the University’s in-person and online classes, it states that remote instruction is “not even remotely worth” what students were charged for Spring Semester 2020 tution.
“Students have been deprived of the opportunity for collaborative learning and in-person dialogue, feedback, and critique,” the lawsuit reads. “The remote learning options are in no way the equivalent of the in-person education that Plaintiff and the putative class members contracted and paid for.”
“Even if Defendant did not have a choice in cancelling in-person classes, it nevertheless has improperly retained funds for services it is not providing,” it continues.
The filing argues that in-person classes allow students to interact with professors and peers; access the University’s libraries and laboratories; and participate in student governance, extracurriculars, and hands-on learning opportunities in ways online classes do not.
Attorney David Pastor, who is representing Student A, did not respond to a request for comment.
University Spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Harvard is the third university in the greater Boston area facing a multi-million dollar lawsuit related to the academic impact of the pandemic. A lawsuit was filed against Boston University over tuition and housing costs last month. Three federal class action lawsuits have been filed against Northeastern University regarding tuition costs, including $50 million dollar grievance by students.
