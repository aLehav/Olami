After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adam Sandler explained it best: "Hanukkah is the festival of lights. Instead of one day of presents, we get eight crazy nights."
That about sums up the holiday. But thankfully, there's more music than just Sandler's humorous song to keep you humming as you spin dreidels and eat latkes (or, more likely given the timing of the holiday this year, as you pray for the miracle that one can of Red Bull lasts for all eight nights of finals period).
Here are Hanukkah songs for every candle:
1. "Light One Candle" by Peter, Paul and Mary
This beautiful song poses big questions like "What      is the memory that's valued so highly that we keep it alive in that flame?      What's the commitment to those who have died when we cry out they've not      died in vain?"
2. "Mi Yimael" and "Maoz Tzur"
These      Hebrew classics retelling the glories of the Hanukkah story have been      around for ages. Now they're on YouTube.
3. "I Am a Latke" –      by Debbie Friedman
Renowned Jewish songwriter Debbie Friedman sings here not just about the      uncomfortable physical experience of being a latke in a blender but also      of Jews' obligation to help the homeless and hungry.
4. "Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel"
No list of Hanukkah songs is complete without the one you probably had      to learn in elementary school on the same day that you put up a Christmas      tree and colored pictures of Kwanzaa candles. Bonus: Watch Jeremy Lin try singing it.
P.S. If you want to expand your      repertoire of music about spinning tops, try "S'vivon." But      really, there's not much to say about a top. The lyrics of that one, in      Hebrew, essentially say, "Little dreidel, spin, spin, spin. Hanukkah, what      a good holiday."
5. "Can I Interest      You in Hanukkah?" by Jon Stewart
The incomparable Jon Stewart tries to convince      Steven Colbert to try a holiday that he sells as "not my least      unfavorite time of year."
6. "Sufganiot" by Rabbi Joe Black
For      some Jewish kids growing up in the '90s, Rabbi Joe Black was the first      person they ever considered a rock star. Or maybe that was just this      blogger. Here, the rockin' rebbe adds to the trove of dreidel and latke      songs with an ode to the second-most-popular Hanukkah food, jelly      doughnuts.
7. "Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah"
Another classic, sung here in Yiddish, English, and Hebrew.
8. "Shine" by The      Maccabeats
The Yeshiva University a cappella group responsible for the      wildly popular "Candlelight" (to the tune of "Dynamite") two Hanukkahs ago, is back this year with an      original song. This time, the video aims to raise awareness about bone      marrow donor registration.
And for your shamash:
Hanukkah Blessings by the Barenaked Ladies.
Apparently they, too, recorded a Hanukkah song. Who knew?
Chag sameach and happy listening!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days after the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would weigh in on two important cases addressing same-sex marriage, it has asked Harvard Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson to argue that the court does not actually have the authority to hear one of those cases.
The court invited Jackson on Tuesday to file an amicus brief arguing that it is unconstitutional for the body to rule on United States v. Windsor, one of two cases addressing the federal Defense of Marriage Act.
Jackson will assert that because the Obama administration has chosen to no longer defend the 1996 law, agreeing with the decision made by a lower court that it is invalid, the court does not have the authority to rule on the case.
A group of senior Republican leaders from the House of Representatives have stepped in to defend the law by taking the place of the executive branch in the case. Jackson will assert that they are not allowed to do so under Article III of the Constitution, meaning the court should drop the case entirely.
Jackson will not argue directly about the constitutionality of DOMA.
Jackson has been a professor at Harvard Law School since 2011. Previously, she was a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, where she also served as an associate dean for research and academic programs.
She has researched and written extensively about constitutional law as an academic and as a legal counsel with the U.S. Department of Justice.
Jackson is not the only Harvard Law professor tapped as an amicus curiae in recent memory. John F. Manning ’82 briefed the court regarding federal reimbursement of hospitals under Medicare earlier this year.
Both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case originally raised in California courts, could potentially lead to the federal redefinition of marriage, which currently says that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. United States v. Windsor was originally raised in New York.
Same-sex couples have long lobbied for a more inclusive definition of marriage that would provide them the same rights and financial benefits enjoyed by married heterosexual couples under the current law.
The court’s decision likely reflects a recent shift in public support in favor of same-sex marriage, as demonstrated by national polling.
The court will likely hear oral arguments for both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry in March and issue its final decisions on both cases in June 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 13, 2012, at 10:45 p.m.
Following months of pressure from students and alumni and similar decisions at other schools, Harvard announced on Thursday that it will create a social choice fund.
When the new fiscal year starts in July, contributions will be invested into one or more mutual funds that “take special account of social responsibility considerations,” according to a University press release. The Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility—a part of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body—will be responsible for selecting those mutual funds.
The press release also stated that every year, 20 percent of the fund’s initial market value would be allocated to support student financial aid. The fund will support this allocation with investment returns and donations, according to University spokesperson Kevin Galvin.
University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement that potential donors had approached her about a socially responsible investment option.
“I have heard from many students and alumni who have asked for additional avenues to support both the University and broader social interests,” Faust said.
In establishing the fund, Harvard follows the lead of several other colleges, including Hampshire, Williams, Vassar, Mount Holyoke, as well as Brown University, which in 2007 became the first Ivy League institution to start a social choice fund.
Responsible Investment at Harvard, an organization of students, alumni, faculty, and other community members, has been lobbying the University to establish such a fund for nearly a year. To this end, members of the organization created their own Fair Harvard Fund, which they hoped would be taken over by the Harvard Management Company, which invests the University’s $30.7 billion endowment.
The Undergraduate Council officially endorsed the Fair Harvard Fund in April, and a referendum endorsing the creation of a social choice fund passed with 80.5 percent of the vote in the November UC presidential election that drew more than half the student body.
Several weeks ago, University leaders met with student advocates to discuss the possibility of a social choice fund. Faust said at the time that she had approached the Corporation about creating a fund and was exploring best practices at other universities.
S. Krishna Dasaratha ’13, Responsible Investment at Harvard’s treasurer, said he was “very happy” when he learned of Thursday’s announcement.
“I was glad to see that the University had responded so quickly to the referendum,” Dasaratha said. “We hadn’t expected it to happen so soon.”
Dasaratha added that he was particularly pleased that unlike similar funds at other schools, Harvard’s fund will not have a minimum gift amount, which will allow even small donors to make contributions.
However, Dasaratha said that he and his organization would have preferred that HMC, instead of an external mutual fund, manage the money.
“They’ll be missing a chance to build up socially responsible investing expertise at the Harvard Management Company, which would prove beneficial to the entire endowment,” Dasaratha said.
Dasaratha also voiced concern about the University’s plan to re-allocate a portion of the fund to financial aid, questioning how the fund would be able to grow if such a large piece of it would be removed annually.
Along with calling for the creation of a social choice fund, Responsible Investment at Harvard has also advocated for transparent money management.
“That’s one of the major factors in making sure the investments are socially responsible,” Dasaratha said, adding that Thursday’s announcement was unclear about what level of transparency would accompany Harvard’s fund.
Galvin said that members the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility would work out “operational details,” such as the determination of which mutual funds would manage the money and whether they would be transparent to the Harvard community, by July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College accepted about 18 percent of early applicants to the Class of 2017 under its early admission program, the University announced Thursday. This year’s 895 early acceptances mark a 16 percent increase over the number of early admittances last year.
This year’s accepted students—the second group to be admitted early since the University reinstated the early action program in 2011—were selected from an early applicant pool of 4,856, which represented a 14 percent increase over the number of early applications received by the admissions office the previous year.
The proportion of students admitted early rose less than a percentage point from last year’s rate. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said the increase in the number of students applying and being admitted early may reflect a general shift in how students apply to college.
Since Princeton and the University of Virginia renewed their early action programs alongside Harvard in 2011, many of Harvard’s most highly regarded peer institutions now offer some form of early admissions. Students no longer need to wait for the regular admissions cycle to apply to their first-choice college.
“I think we’ve reached a point that this is the way people are applying to college,” Fitzsimmons said.
Students admitted early to Harvard this year are those who admissions officers were confident would be accepted during the regular decision cycle, he said.
“Our feeling is that we’re just admitting the same people under slightly different time table,” he said. Fitzsimmsons added that he thinks this year's total number of acceptances was conservative, given the high quality of the applicants.
Harvard’s early admission program is non-binding. Students have until May 1 to accept their spot and may apply to other colleges with a regular decision cycle.
Despite this trend towards applying early, Fitzsimmons said he hopes high school seniors consider their college choices carefully.
“People should, we hope, take the whole senior year to make up their mind about where they go,” he said. “We hope that we’ve at least afforded the opportunity for counselors and parents and the public to really think about that it might not be the best thing to rush into making a college choice.”
The admissions office deferred 3,196 students, who will be considered alongside regular decision candidates, and denied 651.
Although the Admissions Office admitted a larger proportion of the Class of 2017 under early action, Fitzsimmons said that students applying under the regular admissions cycle will not be at a disadvantage.
“We take great pains to say to people that we are not going to make a different decision on your application based on whether or not you apply early or regular,” he said.
Fitzsimmons said that last year the Admissions Office ultimately admitted about 100 students who had been deferred from the early cycle. He said this will likely be the case again.
Emails containing admissions decisions were sent to students at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.
Also this week, Dartmouth accepted 464 of its 1,574 early decision applicants. Most of Harvard’s other peer institutions have not released their early admission numbers yet.

CORRECTION: Dec. 13
An earlier version of this article misstated a quotation by Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. Fitzsimmons spoke of the “time table,” not the “time period,” under which Harvard admits applicants.

It's hard to say for sure which House has won Christmas this year. Eliot and Pfoho wowed judges with draped Christmas lights, and Quincy proved to be a real charmer with hand-cut paper snowflakes hanging from the ceiling and a blow-up penguin near the entrance. Currier put up a modest tree, dwarfed perhaps by its massive rooted mascot. (One hesitates to say that Currier's poor Christmas decoration performance is purposefully protesting the deaths of so many of its pine-y brethren.) As part of our own effort to dole out the holiday cheer, Flyby's giving awards to the best Houses in each category.
 
The Charlie Brown Award
Leverett House takes the twig for least extravagant Christmas tree. No more than seven feet tall, this fake tree does little to lift the mood of exam-crazed bunnies.
 
Bigger is Better
Dunster wins for biggest Christmas tree. The tree beats Adams' by a small margin, mainly because of the antlers on top. (T'was the night before finals, all studying has ceased, every student's out streaking, even the meese.)
The Scrooge Award
You're a mean one, Mr. Mather. Your D-hall's just no fun. The Mather Christmas tree was spotted behind caution tape on Tuesday—are they trying to cancel Christmas?
Most Festive Ambiance
Winthrop decked its halls with boughs of real holly and wreaths, contributing to the cozy atmosphere of its somewhat submerged eating area. Eliot, too, created an amiable atmosphere with its enormous wreath, paper stars, and artfully draped lights.
 
Come One, Come All Welcoming Award 
Kirkland has a kinara for Kwanzaa in addition to a menorah for Hanukkah. Lowell tastefully addressed two of the holidays with a modest tree and an overcompensating menorah. Exactly half of the Houses have decorations for Hanukkah, even if they're just window stickies of menorahs and Stars of David (we're looking at you, Cabot).
