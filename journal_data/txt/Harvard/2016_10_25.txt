After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“Eyewitness” taps into some of the more common storylines on TV these days. It is set in one of those remote and perpetually autumnal small towns. An untried local sheriff (of the brusque yet well-meaning variety) and an overeager partner are called in for their first violent crime. A loner teenager with a distinctive leather jacket faces some bullying in high school. However, “Eyewitness” does seek to upend some of these well-worn plots. The town sheriff is a woman, Helen (Julianne Nicholson), and is a new foster parent to the moody teenager, Philip (Tyler Young.) Philip is secretly best friends—and a little more—with local cool guy Lukas (James Paxton). The distinctive leather jacket is also surprisingly important to the developing plot.
A centerpiece of the show is the burgeoning relationship between Philip and Lukas. In the first five minutes of the premiere, they go from filming amateur dirt bike videos to possibly their first kiss. Their relationship already seems to fall into a well occupied category of gay relationships on screen. Lukas, the popular kid in Red Hook High School, is deeply closeted and refuses to allow Philip to engage him at school. What distinguishes the relationship is that their first romantic interaction is broken up when they witness a gang shooting less than five feet away from their faces. Further, it is revealed they are the only ones who know that the shooter escaped and framed the remaining three murdered victims for the attack.
The boys don’t take long to deal emotionally with the show’s catalyzing event.  Although he appears shaken, Lukas’s main concern is still remaining in the closet (he physically assaults Philip in school when the latter brings up that they are the only people who know the truth), Several scenes later, they are at it again (before Philip pushes Lukas away—a more interesting development in their otherwise trope-y relationship). “Eyewitness” struggles to balance the emotional processing of its scenes with the reveal of information. The clash between subtler moments of introspection and fast-paced plot building results in a disjointed, choppy flow. The camera does not even linger a full 15 seconds on the title card. “Eyewitness” is also stylistically too contrived: Cool, muted, and dusty color palette is overdone; the anxious indie rock soundtrack offers nothing unexpected; and the few establishing shots are either heavy handed metaphors or undescriptive landscapes.
Nicholson, so far, is the standout. She plays a firm yet nuanced sheriff and new foster mother. Moments of banter with her deputy at work or jokes over Chinese food with her husband and Philip add dimension to what could have been a cardboard cutout role. Young and Paxton are well cast as Philip and Lukas and bring an earnestness and realness to their solid performances. One reason to keep watching is Deputy Tony Michaels (Matt Murray), who drives several hours to buy color coded thumbtacks for the sheriff’s office’s first murder board.
It seems that “Eyewitness” could have taken a simpler path and been more successful. The emerging crime drama storylines (a possible inside job by an FBI agent and a growing conflict between local and national police regarding a transient mob) prevent “Eyewitness” from tackling the emotions it wants to in a meaningful and cinematic way. Moments with the potential to be subtle and revealing are hurried along to push more information. A quiet beat in which Helen gets up from bed with her husband to catch a bee is swiftly broken by a call about more information regarding the shooting, and the viewer is left wondering why it was shown at all.
“Eyewitness” overreaches but is overall an interesting revisit to a somewhat saturated genre. Good acting and interesting relationships will most likely continue and develop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the age of 12, Daniel “Danny” M. Troob made his musical debut at Carnegie Hall with a piece orchestrated by himself and conducted by Leopold Stokowski. After graduating from Harvard College in 1970 with a degree in music composition, Troob became an arranger and orchestrator for Disney blockbusters and stage productions. He holds music credits for Disney films such as “Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin,” “The Lion King,” “Pocahontas,” “Hercules,” “Annie,” “Enchanted,” and “Tangled.” He has also won Drama Desk awards for “Big River” and Rodgers & Hammerstein’s “Cinderella,” was nominated for Tony Awards for several of his orchestrations, and has been credited on numerous Broadway productions. Although he has worked across the nation and internationally, he has never “really lived anywhere but New York,” where he grew up and currently resides.
The Harvard Crimson: Music seems to have been a part of your life from an early age. Why did you decide to pursue music composition at Harvard instead of a school specifically dedicated to music?
Danny M. Troob: There are a number of reasons. First, I had studied music in the summers at Juilliard-related facilities, and there was also a [summer] program at Dartmouth…. I also attended Juilliard Prep in New York on Saturdays. I had seen what the conservatory approach was, and there was nothing in it for me. Conservatories are really designed to produce concert artists, and that was not my interest. There was no reason to pursue a conservatory approach. The other schools I applied to were Brandeis and Cornell—I didn’t apply to any schools of music.
THC: How do you feel that you benefited from having that liberal arts education alongside your focus on music?
DMT: I mean, most of my career has been in musical theater or in film, and liberal arts are important. The humanities courses I took were really direct preparation for the work that I do. Of course, the technical work of music you have to know, but I knew that well before I started at Harvard.
THC: Following college, did you immediately know you wanted to compose and orchestrate music for animated films, Disney in particular?
DMT: I knew that I wanted to compose music since I was 10 years old, but the fact that I wound up doing a lot of music… for Disney and other animated film people was because the jobs were available. They called me in for one, it went very well, and they called me in for more. I had started my career in theater in New York, and I still do that, but there was never an abundance of work in New York. It’s always been very dicey. The film and animation industries were very happening when I got into it in the ’90s. Once I got there, it was easy to stay there because that’s where the opportunities were.
THC: You mentioned the differences between classical music and the music that is composed for the stage and for films. How did you learn to compose and orchestrate to fit what the industry was seeking?
DMT: You don’t learn. That’s what the gift is. If you’re gifted, you have an intuition. You find you know things that you weren’t taught, and you’re able to create those things accordingly. Or if it’s less creative work, with orchestration for instance, is what you write on the page what you hear when an orchestra plays it? If you have that sureness of technique, that what you write is what you hear, then you have the most basic qualification for doing that kind of work. It also is a good thing if you happen to have some taste and some style, but the absolute rock bottom is whether or not you can execute.
THC: Could you take me through the process of composing or orchestrating for one of your works, either a staged production or film?
DMT: I can walk you through the process of one of my first stage successes. There was a show called “Big River” based on “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” and it opened in New York in the season of 1985. I was 35 years old, and it was my first really significant credit in theater, not as a player or music director but as a part of the creative team. Roger Miller was the songwriter; he had a really brilliant career in country, although he didn’t consider himself “country.” Anyways, I was called into that situation by a Harvard friend who had been in a Hasty Pudding show I composed, Ed Strong…. “Big River” had been done at Harvard, actually, and was later done at La Jolla, although I was not involved in those productions. They didn’t really think the music had reached its potential, and I had been given a script and—it was so long ago—a cassette tape. I listened, I had my interview, and they asked me if I would be interested in orchestrating the show. And I kind of reframed the question: I told them I had a lot of faith in the production, but they needed a music supervisor, someone to help make Roger’s songs, which were really quite brilliant but quite terse—two minutes, a minute and half, to bring them to the length required for theater—five, six, seven minutes—to develop the material without trashing it. They did not want it to sound like Broadway, but they did want to sell tickets in a Broadway theater. I felt that I was the right person to broaden the scope of this music. The raw material was Roger’s raw material and lyrics. The final product was Roger’s music and lyrics plus my contributions and the contributions of the vocal arranger and the orchestrators…. I became the other composer, and it worked out very well. We won the Tony Award for “Best Musical” and “Best Score.” There had been some years before then when I was struggling to find enough work professionally, but after “Big River” I was able to stay pretty busy.
THC: Could you describe one of your favorite projects?
DMT: There was a musical called “God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,” based on a Kurt Vonnegut novel of the same name. It was written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, who did the big Disney musicals: “Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin,” and “The Little Mermaid.” We were 29 years old, and I was a young musician working on the scene in New York, and they were very gifted writers…. I thought they were brilliant. And I got the job as the orchestrator of the official off-Broadway production, which was not a success. The show had been very effective on the tiny scale, but then when it moved to off-Broadway, it was an uncomfortable size: too big to be small, and much too small to be big. It wasn’t recorded, and it didn’t do much for anybody’s career. Then recently I was asked to reorchestrate the show for a substantial orchestra, 15 pieces, and it was produced this summer at City Center Encores, and I got to hear the work I had imagined it 35 years ago. It’s a wonderful piece: It was filled with the political rage of the 1960s, not camouflaged in any way, an overtly left-wing piece, but the style was mainstream musical music. The song writing was extremely self-assured, that was how I knew Howard and Alan were going to go far. I loved what I brought to it 35 years ago, but I only had five players and not what I would call a competent sound department. This last summer, we had a 15-piece orchestra and a very sympathetic sound department, and it just sounded wonderful. It was just how I had hoped and dreamed it would be experienced. That very rarely happens. Almost always when you get done with something, you’re left with more disappointment than satisfaction. But “Rosewater” was really a pleasure, and I understand that’s going to be recorded—I don’t know when—but just the experience of it at the City Center was extremely gratifying. It was a nice bookend to my active career because it started when I was a neophyte and it ended now when I’m just beginning to start working less than I used to.
THC: You mentioned that you orchestrated or composed for the Hasty Pudding. What other productions were you a part of here at Harvard?
DMT: Right, that was composing. Well, the Hasty Pudding was probably the most important because it was the peak of my Harvard career. Another show that I worked on as an arranger, pianist, and music supervisor, was called “Prince Erie”... which was a standout production. It was probably the most successful show to be done at the Loeb during my four years at Harvard.
THC: What differences do you have to take into account when composing for the stage versus for film?
DMT: The biggest difference is that there are so many more musicians available for film. You can have a 70 to 80 piece orchestra, an enormous orchestra. Stage productions, even if they have 20 musicians, it’s usually not as many as you need to create the sound that you want, and 20 would be considered a very big amount nowadays. When I started in theater, 22 to 25 was standard, but [for today] I would say 14 to 16. The other big difference is that when you orchestrate for theater, it has to be performed in real-time for eight shows a week. You have to be careful about creating parts that can be executed accurately (every time). It can’t be as technically challenging as for film. Anything that’s recorded only needs to be performed perfectly one time, while something done on stage has to be played perfectly eight times a week, 52 weeks a year. You’re drawing on a canvas of a very different size, and your priorities are much more limited…. With film, pretty much anything is possible: If you can write it, they can play it.
THC: Do you have a preference for one over the other?
DMT: Yes, I prefer writing for the stage. I’m from New York; theater was my first interest. I love the live experience. There’s some honesty in the fact that the real-timeness of it means that what the audience is seeing and hearing is what’s really going on. Things have changed so much in pop music and in film and all the things that are created for the internet—it’s nice when you write for the stage to have a connection with a form that’s thousands of years old.
THC: You touched upon pop music and the internet, but have the technological advances in animation and music production affected your process of orchestrating music?
DMT: When I worked for theater, I had to write for a combination of acoustic instruments, synthesizers, and prerecorded music and other electronic elements, and I’ve learned how to do all that, but I’m personally pretty much a throwback to the older way of doing things, and to some extent, that’s been limiting to my career. But it’s who I am, and since there’s loads of younger people who grew up more in the pop tradition and computer age, it’s pointless to try to compete on their terms. I’m more comfortable doing what I grew up knowing and where I feel that I’m on secure ground when I pick up a pencil. I still write longhand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 28, 2014, anyone privy to the premiere of “Lifestyle” by Rich Gang caught a startling glimpse into the future as Young Thug squalled these immortal words: “ENnemLIbmLIBLIKubuhGETenDISssALLenbuGEHNEEUEHN.” Since then, many in the mumble rapper mold have stepped up: Future, swimming backstroke up a river of codeine and Auto-Tune to mainstream success; Fetty Wap, whose infectious baying can still be heard on radios across the globe; even a new wave comprising rappers like Lil Yachty and Lil Uzi Vert, who have drawn the ire of respected figures such as Pete Rock, Anderson .Paak, and Ab-Soul by flouting the history and traditions of hip hop (and of speech).
Of course, emcees who place a premium on the meaningful, articulate use of language still remain relevant. Kendrick Lamar and Earl Sweatshirt, for instance, both enjoy enormous, devoted followings. Yet the vanguard of rap seems to consist primarily of marble mouths, more concerned with turning up than speaking intelligibly. Full disclosure: I think Young Thug is a true (if inconsistent) innovator, and when Lil Yachty comes in on “Broccoli,” I start hopping around with joy. However, if the prospect of rap being overrun by mumblers fills you with anxiety, know you have GZA’s razor-sharp, lyrically peerless “Liquid Swords” to fall back on.
In the halcyon, prelapsarian mid-’90s, where emcees like Nas could supposedly skyrocket to legend status based solely on their skill with the pen, GZA still stood alone. Even the other, uniformly top-tier members of the seminal Wu-Tang Clan prostrated themselves before “the Genius,” as Wu’s biggest star Method Man explained. “He’s the head, let’s put it that way. We form like Voltron, and GZA happens to be the head,” he said in the interview appended to “Can It Be All So Simple.” Indeed, GZA’s first solo outing after Wu-Tang’s explosive debut showcased his intensely cerebral nature and emphasis on lyrics above all else. He doesn’t waste ink; he thinks, and “Liquid Swords” is thus all about “murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft,” as GZA proclaims on “Duel of the Iron Mic.”
You’d be hard pressed to find a rapper with as strong a handle on and as abundant a love for words as the Genius. According to Polygraph, which traffics in “visually-driven essays” about pop culture, GZA has the second-largest vocabulary in hip hop, and he draws from it liberally as he interlocks internal rhyme after internal rhyme like pieces in a puzzle. Any given verse is dense with intricate constructions. “And from that point, the God made a statement / Draftin’ tracements, replacements in basements / Materials in sheet-rock to sound proof the beatbox / And microscopic optics to see through the boxes / Obnoxious topic,” he raps on “Living in the World Today.” He also has a novelist’s knack for literary devices: Genius (the lyrics website) counts 11 similes and 13 metaphors on the title track alone, with the Genius (the rapper) tossing out the word “like” more frequently than a valley girl. Couplets such as “I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe / On some wild out shit to insert a fiend,” evince his near-Shakespearean facility with language.
GZA, of course, is perfectly aware of his skill and enthusiastically carries on the ancient hip-hop tradition of rhyming about how good he is at rhyming. In the process, he betrays one of his favorite pastimes: dispatching weaker emcees. The second line of the whole album is, after all, “In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns.” These fantasies pepper the album, with GZA executing the deed aggressively (with “double-edged guillotines” and “fatal flying spikes”) or subtly (“I’ll be that whiskey in your liver”). Much of his disdain for his victims stems from their single-minded pursuit of a record deal, as he explains on “Shadowboxin’”: Instead of “[breaking] through like the Wu, unexpectedly” as they should, they “flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate industry.” Yet his main problem with the competition? Their misplaced priorities make them disgracefully shabby when it comes to the craft itself. He tellingly refers to them as “non-visual”; meanwhile, GZA has an eye like Scorsese. While it has become a cliche to refer to any Wu-Tang project as “cinematic,” it is hard to avoid that word when it is built into the Genius’s style. As he told British music magazine “Select” in 1996, “I’m on a different level, trying to be cinematic…I’m tryin’ to make it more visual.”
He succeeds wildly in his aims: Listening to “Liquid Swords” with your eyes closed feels like GZA has set up shop inside your head, pointing a projector at the backs of your eyelids. For instance, when he dips into mafioso rap, the subgenre resurrected by Wu compatriot Raekwon, the results are stunning. On “Hell’s Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304,” he reels off vivid, imaginative vignettes, featuring “bombs in bottles of champagne” and an “ex-worker [who] tried to smuggle a half a key / In his left leg, even underwent surgery / They say his pirate limp gave him away / As the Feds rushed him coming through U.S. customs.”
“Liquid Swords” brims with such powerfully evocative touches. On “Gold,” GZA waits for the subways to rumble overhead so he may inconspicuously execute his rivals, who “pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop / Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock.” In the next verse, a man runs out of ammunition, and “his Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors.” RZA’s signature pummeling drums and discordant samples amplify the eerie cold-bloodedness of GZA’s scenes, as does the genuinely chilling dialogue lifted from martial arts films: The album opens with a child quietly informing the audience that his father decapitated “a hundred and thirty-one lords” for a shogun whose “brain was infected by devils.”
Of course, GZA’s subject matter is not limited to braggadocio and creepy violence. On “I Gotcha Back,” he advises and reassures his nephews, all while painting a painful portrait of his upbringing. “My lifestyle was so far from well / Could've wrote a book with a title ‘Age 12 and Going Through Hell,’” he raps, before offering up this heartbreaking image: “Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard / Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard.” On “Swordsman,” he urges the idea of shunning dogma and thinking for yourself: “Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on / And got caught up in superstition […] / But with knowledge of self from off the shelf / Made things seemed complicated now small like elves.”
No matter the topic, GZA brings intelligence and eloquence, an approach which served him well in the end: Twenty years later,  “Liquid Swords” has endured. Today, its varied subject matter, rich details, and considered lyricism make it the perfect respite from a world where thoughtful rap is in short supply. If hearing Lil Yachty haltingly rap “I know you want this for life / Taking pictures with all my ice” leaves you paralyzed with existential dread, you can always throw on “Liquid Swords” and, as RZA intoned on the title track, let GZA “take y’all back to the source.”

1990, Manchester. A young woman weaves her way through the crowd to board a packed train en route to London. As she sits down, a black-haired, bespectacled, and scarred boy strolls into her head. He arrives “very fully formed.” By the time she arrives home, she has developed the outline into what will become the smash hit Harry Potter series, which will sell more copies than any other series ever. Throughout her subsequent plethora of interviews, J.K. Rowling has been asked again and again for her favorite books and their influence upon her own writing. Some of her answers: “The Iliad”—the desecration of Cedric’s body. “Macbeth”—Voldemort’s hearing of the prophecy. “The Chronicles of Narnia”—the Hogwarts Express, equivalent to that wonderful wardrobe.
Early 1900s, Switzerland. A foreigner buys a postcard entitled “Der Berggeist” (“the mountain spirit”) and decorated with a painting of a bearded figure in a forest, extending his hands to a white fawn. On the postcard’s paper cover, the man scrawls “The origin of Gandalf.” The postcard may have contributed to the image of J.R.R. Tolkien’s famous wizard, but Tolkien drew inspiration from several sources for Gandalf’s creation. The name itself originates from the Old Norse words for “magic” and “elf.” (Later, Tolkien regretted borrowing his character names from Norse, as he had to account for how their meanings make sense in the context of “The Lord of the Rings”). The first character bearing the name Gandalf appeared in Norse mythology as a legendary king; in 1896, we spy him again as a character in William Morris’s fantasy novel “The Well at the World’s End,”a book known to have deeply influenced Tolkien.
January 28, 1865, Cincinnati. Margaret Garner and her family are recently escaped slaves on the route to freedom. They have only been at their first stop for a couple of hours when their slave master and an army of marshals arrive at the house. To Margaret, slavery is a heavier chain than death, and only one option remains. By the time the marshals reach her, she has slit the throat of her two-year-old daughter, wounded the others, and is attempting to kill herself. A hundred years later, Toni Morrison tells the woman’s story in her novel “Beloved.” “It was not a story to pass on,” as Morrison describes it. But she chooses to tell the story anyway—on her own terms. She admits to purposely not investigating the facts of the case, in order to assure “an alliance with my imagination.”
Above are snapshots of inspiration. There’s no theft here, because no one can lay claim to the long history of storytelling. But we see the copying and borrowing that goes on with every additional grizzled old wizard or fallen hero. The pieces aren’t new: sets of archetypes, motifs, themes, symbols, a handful of plots. What we’re trying to express, largely, is not new. For instance, “The Lion King” is “Hamlet” with lions; the plot of coming-of-age ’90s flick “Clueless” is loosely based on that of Jane Austen’s “Emma”; Taylor Swift’s albums were co-written by the dozens of boys who broke her heart. Disney takes inspiration from itself, recently committing to 16 remakes of its classics, many of which are adapted from fairytales. Dumbledore himself treads on the coattails of Gandalf, who set the modern-day archetype of a grizzled old wizard in charge of helping the protagonist do his thing.
Yet each new piece, by merit of its addition, changes the story that our art is telling. As Telegraph book reviewer Kasia Boddy notes: “There may be only seven basic plots, but there are thousands of stories. What we call the greatest of these are works that stand out from the crowd, and their greatest readers are those who give due weight to each one's own peculiarity.” By virtue of these individual peculiarities, authors have the ability to reshape the current standard; archetypes and themes evolve with use and time like a cliff constantly exposed to the sea. We see this evolution in the 11th century invention of Merlin, which reshaped the archetypal “wise old man” into the form of a magician or wizard and paved the way for such big names as Gandalf and Dumbledore. As our mediums change, we are able to bring dusty stories back to life, just as the family-friendly animation of Disney classic “The Lion King” acquaints young children with a tale that was written down four centuries ago, and just as Toni Morrison’s novel “Beloved” shares the story of a woman that would have otherwise been lost in the archives along with its horrible lesson. We return to the same old stories, even as they are endlessly rewritten, and endlessly new.

Can you judge a book by its cover? Or, more importantly, can you judge a music video by the little still on its YouTube preview?
If so, The Weeknd’s recently released music video for single “False Alarm” may not be for the faint of heart. The video’s preview shows a woman covered in splattered blood and giving the camera a set of dead eyes. For the sake of the review, we proceeded.
The track “False Alarm” is one of the new singles off the R&B singer’s latest album, “Starboy.” The uncharacteristically quick tempo of the music is echoed in the fast pace of the film. And here, it seems, the resemblance between the two ends. The video soon reveals itself to be a riff on a GTA-esque first-person shooter game. We start with a bloody bank robbery, which we seem to be expected to associate with alarms under the crime umbrella. But this is no false alarm. A couple poor souls meet their end by machine guns, and the rest of the room gets an unhealthy dose of (suspiciously aesthetic) purple gas. Yup, this is starting to look like some grade A Weeknd fun. The man who crashed cars in “The Hills” and burned alive in “Can’t Feel My Face” is alive and well and has apparently learned nothing about the grim realities of mortality.
Then the video gets to the meat of the story. A young, frail waif of a woman is captured by the bank robbers (which includes you, because of the first-person perspective) and thrown in a truck. “False Alarm” as a track seems to be a thematic break from The Weeknd’s other material. The premise of the song is that the woman in question is a “false alarm” because “She loves everybody / She gets off all the time.” For a singer whose songs are not exactly filled with female empowerment, this seems to be a blindingly bright display of femme fatality.
But The Weeknd is having none of this chick’s sexual independence, and he takes it out on her in this bloodbath of a music video. She gets handcuffed, tossed into trucks, tossed out of trucks, and splattered with blood. What happened to her false alarms? Or any sounds of any kind? The punky lighting schemes in this clip make her doe eyes look even more doe-like, but we never actually see her assert much of any power. Possibly at the end, when she uncuffs herself and walks away? That must have been her manipulative femme fatale persona coming through!
The end of the piece provides some hope for those panicky about The Weeknd’s next foray into dangerous conflict. When the camera finally leaves first person to turn us onto his face (before he cocks a gun to his mouth), his shaky hands grip the cross on his necklace. The Weeknd may be approaching religious epiphany, and the world may be a safer place for women yet.

The creation of a space may begin with its physical features, but it does not end there. The architectural aspects of a space, its use and purpose, the people who pass through every day and the things that they do there all combine to define a space. Often, a space is designed for a particular usage, and its physical aspects therefore complement its purpose. Other times, it evolves to fit a purpose over time. Whatever the case, this human aspect of definition allows spaces to drastically change, even while their architecture remains exactly the same.
As the Harvard University Dining Service workers strike, many of the dining halls have stopped serving food. As a result, the spaces that are the House dining halls have fundamentally changed. While no food is served in the halls, these spaces remain open, and students have continued to use them. Based on my limited observation as I sat and sketched, it seems that Adams dining hall has become primarily a place of study. Without the draw of meals, it is now emptier and quieter, creating an atmosphere similar to that of a library. Yet chatter still fills the space, as some of the informality of a dining hall is retained. Almost overnight, without any alteration to the physical features or architecture, the house dining halls have been transformed into spaces that are entirely new.

In an era dominated by innovative console gaming, eager fans just can’t get enough. It seems as though every year, every month, a new and exciting idea is introduced to the ever-expanding world of console gaming. Game designer George Batchelor plans to raise the bar even higher with upcoming game “Far from Noise,” which attempts to combine video gaming with philosophy and introspection. In “Far from Noise,” “you play a young woman who is basically stuck in a car that is trapped on the edge of a cliff. All she can do is talk. Talking to herself, rationalizing the situation,” Batchelor says.
That is the premise for the entire game: a woman trapped on the edge of a cliff, awaiting her own death. “Eventually a deer walks in. This story can go in different ways. Ultimately, you start to figure out who she is, why she came out there, if any of it is even real,” Batchelor says. Directed through dialogue chosen by the player, the woman is led down a path of self-reflection, enlightenment, happiness, sadness, and hopefully an appreciation for life itself.
The transcendentalists of the 19th century had significant influences on the development of this game. “It’s based a bit on what I was reading at the time. I read ‘Walden,’ and then some of Emerson’s work. That type of writing, passion about nature, the spirit—that influenced where the story went. It’s quite a central theme of a game. Although she is trapped in this life or death situation, it’s still an opportunity to look at nature and take all of that in,” Batchelor says.
Based on the player’s responses during the conversation, the game goes down one of many possible paths. Each one is unique, with each decision branching from each previous one. However, Batchelor urges players not to mistake the general feeling of the game. “[It] is quite lighthearted. It is very jokey, not that serious. The serious bits are woven into the funny parts. It’s a nice mix, I hope,” he says.
More than anything else, it is a personal odyssey. The game is Batchelor’s expectation-defying attempt to create a 21st century medium through which players can experience the soul-opening effects of truly journeying into oneself. “I want them to see what they think they want to say. And then I want them to see what the other voice in their head is thinking about saying. It’s meditative,” Batchelor says.

Matvey Soykin rolls his alto saxophone, tied to a small metal dolly, around Paine Hall, home to the Harvard Music Department. A tall, lanky nine-year-old, Soykin may well weigh less than his instrument, and the sight of him pulling the case along, as if walking a large dog, is especially endearing as he walks down the hallway of austere practice rooms usually occupied by virtuosic Harvard musicians.
For the past year, Soykin has taken saxophone lessons with David A. Armenta ’17 through the Phillip Brooks House Association Harvard and Radcliffe Musical Outreach to Neighborhood Youth Mentoring program, which offers free private music lessons to Cambridge public school students. Matvey’s mother, Alisa T. Apreleva, never thought she would be able to find a saxophone teacher willing to take on such a young student—or who charged affordable fees. But when she received an email publicizing HARMONY, Apreleva gave it a shot. “I didn't think it would work,” she says, “but I just wrote ‘saxophone’ as the instrument [on the application form]…. And suddenly, there was David.”
HARMONY is one of around 10 student groups at Harvard that fall under the umbrella of arts service organizations. These groups vary in size, media, intended audience, and mission, from Harvard Artistz’s (HARTZ) 10 undergraduates bringing visual arts activities to the Cambridge Rehabilitation Nursing Center to CityStep’s 30 to 40 undergraduates and around 100 Cambridge public school students clapping, jumping, and stomping their way through original choreography.
Incorporating art into community outreach poses its unique challenges—most notably, ensuring that art-making’s technical aspect does not become a barrier between student artists and the people with whom they want to connect. The relationships and experiences these organizations make, however, also offer unique fulfillment. As the roles of service and art in society remain under debate, Harvard’s art service initiatives continue to evolve and expand, broadening arts access in surrounding communities and, in turn, shaping campus artistic life.
Student who participate in community outreach through art come from all concentrations and artistic backgrounds. Many became involved as a way to exercise their skills in a more casual setting and as a component of their general interests in public service.
Emma F. Stone ’19 didn’t have space in her freshman fall semester schedule for visual art classes, so she joined Harvard College Stories for Orphans to continue making art. She took a gap year before matriculating, in which she spent interning with an artist who illustrated story books. “I just want to constantly be doing or [be] engaged with the arts despite whether my academics or concentration involves [arts specifically]—just to constantly have that as an outlet,” she says. Stone had also done service work before, though none that actively incorporated the arts. Now, as artistic director for Stories for Orphans, she is using her talent to illustrate and edit personalized picture books for orphans around the world.
Rose M. Whitcomb ’16 has wanted to become a music educator since her senior year of high school, as her formative years of band and orchestra drew to a close. She spent two summers at Harvard directing Summer HARMONY, leading fellow undergraduates as they taught basic musical theory to students across PBHA’s Summer Urban Program. “Music has been a part of my life ever since I was small,” she says. “It’s a space where people come together…. And just watching how excited people were about what I was doing, let alone my own excitement, I knew this was something I wanted to continue.” Upon graduating with an A.B. in music, Whitcomb decided to stay in Cambridge, where she now works as a substitute teacher at Prospect Hill Academy, helping to restart the school’s drumline program.
Whitcomb’s desire to grant others access to art-making experiences as profound as her own is a motivation other volunteers and mentors widely share. Armenta has played saxophone for about 10 years, during which music has not only helped him develop discipline and rigor applicable to every aspect of his life but also served as a method of introspection. “There are a lot of moments when you stop and think, ‘Why am I doing this? Why am I spending hundreds of hours learning this?’...  and you're forced to figure out why you're doing it. I think a lot of times the answer you come up with is useful for the rest of your life.” Private lessons were essential to Armenta’s growth as a musician, but he realizes their prohibitive costs. “If I could offer whatever I can to people for free—at least help a young student grow and sort of expand their base of musical knowledge—I think that's a really cool thing to be able to do,” he says.
Those interviewed also overwhelmingly mentioned the opportunity to deeply connect with people as one of the most gratifying aspects of what they do. The enjoyment generated by the experience of dancing, singing, or painting together nurtures familiarity in a way that other types of service may not be able to. “For me, a lot of people look at volunteering as a chore or something you don't want to do but should do out of the goodness of your heart,” says Missy J. Dreier ’19, a co-director of PBHA’s Student Theater Advancing Growth and Empowerment program. “But I think for me, it's never really felt that way. I think of volunteering as something you should want to do and be excited about, and for me that kind of manifests in bridging my interests in theater and my love of kids with doing STAGE, which is something I love to do.”
Even as Stories for Orphans literally ships picture books across the world, art creates an extremely personal space: Each orphan sends a biography from which their writer-illustrator team crafts a narrative. “It's a way to connect with someone whom you would never know from any other aspect of life,” writing director Lance M. Johnson ’17 says. “It shows [the orphans] that they are important as individuals, that their unique qualities and preferences matter.”
Fellow writing director Andrea N. Colon-Perez ’18 agrees. “I feel like... you can kind of connect to the child instead of just doing something for them that might not really connect with…. You can do it better through arts if you have a story or music or crafts or stuff like that... instead of a general ‘I'm going to make food’ or stuff like that.”
For many students volunteering with arts service groups, however, artistic proficiency has required years’ worth of practice. Art’s technical demand raises the question of exactly how to reach out using such specialized activities, especially in the case of underserved or dispossessed communities. Groups that work with the elderly, for example, must navigate interactions with those in drastically different living circumstances, some of who suffer conditions that render even basic physical and verbal communication difficult. Volunteers teaching children who are very young or who do not have the bounty artistic resources many Harvard students have had must find innovative ways to motivate students and provide them with impactful experiences within their means. And looming behind it all is the peril of the unsavory power dynamic, which haunts every service-based interaction but may be especially exacerbated by art-making’s technicality.
Andrew G. Clark, Harvard director of choral activities and a senior lecturer on music, has brought these questions into a formal classroom setting: Last spring, he taught the first iteration of Music 176r, “Music and Disability.” The course’s syllabus spans the literature of music education and therapy, disabilities studies in music and arts activism, and cognitive neuroscience, among other topics; it also incorporates an engaged scholarship component that sends students to shadow various organizations in the greater Boston community providing inclusive art-making opportunities for people with disabilities.
“We were really careful, just for [Music 176r], not to frame this as service or outreach or help,” Clark says. “Our students were simply making music in a new environment, in an unfamiliar context, as a way of reflecting on how music can shape community; how music can contribute—or not—to one's quality of life; and how those experiences… informed their own musical values.”
Clark works closely with Music in Hospitals and Nursing Homes Using Entertainment as Therapy—which, since its founding in 1996, has followed a more traditional music outreach mold. Students arrive at the nursing homes, introduce themselves, perform, speak to the residents for a little, and then leave. After taking Music 176r and working with Clark through Collegium, respectively, MIHNUET vice president Alan Z. Yang ’18 and co-president Ryan B. Song ’17 have begun to reconsider the program’s structure.
“We’ve had wonderful relationships for the past two decades,” Yang says, “but then Dr. Clark's class got me thinking: How can we better engage the seniors? It's better to think about how we can perform with… instead of at or for.” Song and Yang’s brainstorming generated Crooners, which they now co-direct. Crooners is an initiative within MIHNUET in which the senior residents and undergraduates sing together in a circle, sometimes pausing to reflect on what songs mean to them or to listen to student performances and give the seniors’ voices a break. Residents who are nonverbal, unable to read the song lyrics, or unwilling to sing can follow the beat using small percussion instruments provided by MIHNUET.

So far, Song and Yang say, Crooners seems to be going well. But dynamic and impact remain contentious points with which individuals running the programs must constantly grapple.
Whitcomb always keeps music’s inherent limitations and finitude in mind. “It’s not just like… they’re going to have the same experiences that I have,” she says. “Music is such a personal thing to people…. And it’s always something you can worry about late at night: Does this really make a difference, or do these kids really believe in me?.... You question that of yourself too—like, do I really believe in my students? Those kinds of worries are just the nature of this type of work, and you have to confront those questions, otherwise you’re not connecting deeply enough. And they’re also kind of unanswerable. I can’t say whether I did a good job, only the students can really say… not even really in the moment, but years later, whether that program is effective for them or not.”
Despite the constant uncertainty, Whitcomb and her peers persist from moment to moment. “There’s a sense of completeness in that I helped somebody have a good hour of their morning,” she says. “Not that it was bad before, but I could just be part of having a good experience, of having a good moment.”
HARTZ co-director Jang H. Lee ’19 expresses a similar opinion. “It’s not just about the art-making,” he says. “For some of the elderly, they don't even care about drawing or painting, and we're completely fine with them. Some of them just want to talk to us.” He recalls a resident who initially would not participate in the art activities or interact with him at all. As the weeks passed and Lee continued to approach her, she slowly opened up. “Every time she sees me now she smiles and speaks and talks with me,” he says, laughing. “It’s really cute.”
American culture generally regards art as a luxury, a private activity for and accessible to only those with disposable time and income—or at least this belief seems to be the case, if government spending is any indicator. In the past two decades, the government has slashed public funding for in-school arts programs and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The NEA’s budget decreased an astounding 50 percent in 1980, followed by a prolonged decline of over 77 percent to the present day. According to the Atlantic, the overall amount of public art grant money, adjusted for inflation, has decreased by 26 percent since 1995.

While Harvard’s volunteer-staffed arts service organizations operate on relatively low budgets gathered from across various College and PBHA grants, and typically only cover transportation and some materials, the questions remain: Why place art at the focus of service at all? What use do people have for art if they lack homes, food, motor control, a good education, or any of the other immediate needs that well-meaning volunteers could spend their time addressing instead?
André de Quadros, professor of music at Boston University and a mentor to the students in Harvard’s MIHNUET program, regards the last question—and the general attitude toward art as “supplementary”—as misguided. De Quadros has dedicated his life to building musical community: Among other things, he teaches music in state prisons and juvenile detention centers and conducts Common Ground Voices, a choir comprising Israeli, Palestinian, and Swedish musicians. De Quadros points out that Article 27 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares the enjoyment of and participation in art a universal right.
“And that is perhaps crucially different from making a case on the basis of needs,” he says. “In order for me to say you… need music… I have to make a judgment about what your needs are. But if you have a right to music, then it's not up to me or anybody to decide.... There's also a needs-based argument, obviously, because we have a hunger for music. And I understand… about food and shelter and all those other things that are critical, but there is no human society, including in circumstances where people are suffering deeply… in which some form of music doesn't exist.” In de Quadros’s view, it is those most lacking in resources—whose engagement in art may be overlooked in the face of more immediate needs—who actually need art the most.
Winfield S. “Scott” Benner can testify to the importance of art, even—or perhaps especially—to the underprivileged. A series of misfortunes struck Benner between 2009 and 2013: The steel company he had been working for laid him off; he was diagnosed with Horner’s Syndrome, an optic nerve inflammation that caused crippling headaches; and his wife, who had been employed on-and-off, was diagnosed with cancer. By October 2013, Benner was living on the streets and spending nights at a shelter in Quincy. To alleviate the monotony and harsh reality of life in the shelter, Benner turned to drawing, his longtime hobby. Upon seeing Benner’s work, a counselor told Benner about a group that had come to his church and sold art by homeless and disabled artists. Benner searched “homeless artists” online and found the website of a company named ArtLifting.
Founded by Liz J. Powers ’10 and her brother Spencer Powers, ArtLifting curates and sells work by underprivileged and homeless artists. When Benner stumbled across it in early 2014, the company had just launched. Benner emailed Powers and, after a few meetings, signed onto the ArtLifting team.
“That was the beginning of the change of my life,” he says. “May of that [2014], I did the City Art show… at the Prudential Center. That was the very first time I ever showed my art in public or intended to sell it, and I made 300-something dollars that afternoon. At that point, I probably hadn't had more than 10 dollars in my pocket at any given time for the last six months…. I remember thinking, ‘Wow, I can really do something with this art.’” Since that first show, Benner’s art has displayed in a solo exhibition on Newbury Street. He now lives in Maine, where he works on his art full time.
Regaining financial stability was undeniably critical for Benner, but the dignity and recognition of being able to lift himself up as an artist were also extremely important—not only to him but also to others at the shelter. “A lot of people were inspired by what was going on with me,” Benner says. “I had guys who didn't have artistic talent coming to me and asking for paper and pens and bringing me finished pictures…. I've seen some other guys... trying to make a go of it. I've seen pictures of some of them on Facebook… I know some of them are in the selling phase and doing that stuff.”
Though ArtLifting operates for profit, its philosophy, like those of its non-profit peers, is rooted in the belief that art serves as a powerful and integral aspect of human expression and dignity. Powers, a visual artist herself, worked with homeless individuals for many years before starting ArtLifting. “I did a lot of listening,” she says, “and a lot of my clients have said, ‘Liz, I don't want another handout, I just want an opportunity. Opportunity to change my own life.’ And that was why we created ArtLifting as a for-profit, as a business, because we thought: ‘People don't want to be charity cases; they simply want their invisible talents to be seen.’” In the future, she hopes to start more companies that allow people to contribute their hidden skill sets to the economy.
In addition to these more quantifiable benefits of artistic engagement, CityStep founder Sabrina T. Peck ’84 points to the body of research that ties art to neurological development. “An artistic experience is a critical piece of cognitive development,” she says. “And it's a critical piece of identity development…. All the research shows that children who are able to express themselves creatively, who are able to build a sense of identity from the inside out, do better. Do better in school, do better with peers, do better in society.”
Caroline A. Butler-Rahman has taught sixth and seventh graders at the Amigos School for more than eight years and now helps coordinate between the school and CityStep. Her daughters went through the CityStep program, too, for which she is very grateful. “Students... find it to be a safe and joyous place to find themselves and to get to know their classmates outside of school, outside of the academic, in a way where the playing field evens out,” she says. “It allows kids with equally strong but very different skills and strengths to feel really capable and be leaders.”
Apreleva can also corroborate the positive effects of music. HARMONY has provided the family with far more than saxophone lessons: HARMONY gives Soykin the opportunity to connect with a mentor and role model who is familiar with the language and culture, which, since Apreleva and her husband are both Russian immigrants, is harder for Soykin to access at home.
In Apreleva’s opinion, this aspect of HARMONY has made the biggest difference. “It was really difficult for [Matvey] to connect to other people [at school],” she says. “He really thrives on individual connection, and it is sometimes difficult to get this connection…. And here was an opportunity for him to… really know David and to really get known and be discovered…. I think it's huge for Matvey's sense of self-respect and self-worth. He knows that he can relate and he is worth something. It's about expressing yourself through music, and for Matvey that's a change we see.”
Though Soykin still speaks softly and sometimes haltingly, Apreleva says he has begun composing and singing to himself around the house—an outgrowth of self-expression that coincided with the start of his HARMONY lessons. And inspired by Armenta, who is concentrating in molecular and cellular biology, Matvey has set his sights becoming a scientist in addition to a musician.
“I think at that moment it is something like astrobiophysicist,” Apreleva says. “It changes all the time, but now he has this notion that you can be many things in life.”
For Peck, the most distinguishing aspect of service in the arts is its ability to foster rich, thriving exchanges that challenge and inspire all participants. “The reciprocal aspect of CityStep is extremely important to me,” she says. “That it is not just the benefit that these undergrads are providing students. It's that they, in turn, reap so many benefits from this service experience, because it is a life-changing experience.”
Laura E. Weidman Powers ’04, a CityStep alum, says that she learned at least as much from CityStep as she did in her undergraduate classes. “It was really influential in how I learned to work on teams and also lead peers,” she says. “It also showed me a lot about the power of using something like art as a medium and a message for connecting with folks who are from a different background or having a different experience from you.” Today, Weidman Powers channels CityStep’s spirit of growth and self-discovery as CEO of Code2040, a nonprofit that encourages and supports black and Latina women in tech and has received recognition from Fortune, The Knight Foundation, and the White House.
“I’m trying to, with Code2040, create a similar experience [to CityStep], where students can be exposed to, in this case, technology and what they can do with their academic skill set around computer science,” Weidman Powers says. “To create a chance for them to set themselves on a trajectory as a result of the experiences and exposure that they've had.”
Dreier thinks that her work teaching elementary school students how to write and put on plays directly benefits her other roles in theater. “I have mostly acted in my life, and now I’m actually directing [at Harvard], and I think STAGE has helped me a lot,” she says. “Being a director and being a teacher, there is a fine line… but I feel like practically it has… given me some useful skills in that way.”
For Yang and Song, MIHNUET has reshaped their perspectives as musicians. “[It’s] definitely helped me realize that as a musician, I have a responsibility to also make sure that I can make sure everybody, regardless of their age or background or socioeconomic status… has the means to be able to create and be involved with the music-making process,” Song says.
Yang adds that he has been rethinking why he makes music. “Sometimes it's all too easy to get trapped in a line of thought where we're pursuing… some very specific aesthetic ideal,” he says, “and I think my work with MIHNUET has shown me… that music can be collaborative and democratic. We don't always have to be pursuing technical perfection; we can think about how this experience can be meaningful for all those involved. And that was very liberating.”
Johnson, too, feels freed in his artistic perspective. “Working with Stories for Orphans has… made me think about this idea that any aspect of who I am can contribute something good to the lives of others when properly applied. I didn't think before that writing or art—just my hobby—would be something that does anything for anyone other than myself. And now it's a contribution.” As he works to confirm and support the humanity of the orphans he works with, they in turn have helped him confirm and support his work as an artist.
The impact community service has had on Clark transcends the bounds of art. “I've been doing this work for 17 years… because it absolutely continues to change and transform my life,” Clark says. “We’ve taken students to some music workshops in a prison here in Massachusetts, and we leave just so humbled—and not in a way that's like, ‘Oh, my life is so much better because I see what terrible suffering and oppression these incarcerated individuals are going through.’ It's actually quite the opposite: You sort of realize, ‘Wow, here are my prisons and my disabilities and what I'm working through as a human being.’”
Despite the national trend of funding cuts in the arts, Harvard’s arts service programs continue to strengthen and grow. Crooners is currently piloting its new group singing approach at Chestnut Park Assisted Living and hopes to eventually use it at all of MIHNUET’s partnered living facilities. ArtLifting now works with 72 artists in 19 cities across the United States. Harvard’s CityStep is working to expand to fifth through seventh graders at every school in the Cambridge public school system; higher up, Peck is preparing to launch CityStep.org, an undergirding platform through which the board will help facilitate and fundraise for program development across all four of its universities—and eventually, Peck hopes, make CityStep a national endeavor. HARMONY is eyeing a partnership with schools in Tunisia through Skype. And Clark’s class on music and disabilities was just one of 14 new courses that will be developed as part of the recently established $15 million Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship.
Clark, Song, Yang, and other members of Music 176r want to bring all of these currently disparate organizations together, united in their drive to broaden arts access for communities around Harvard and the nation. They’ve been working on projects within Arts First that would actively engage the festival’s audience in the art-making process. Current proposals include a series of workshops offered across all media, connected to the work of different arts service organizations at Harvard.
Peck thinks arts initiatives can play a crucial role in bringing together what feels like an increasingly divided world. “I was a social studies major, and I'm an artist…. What I see is: In our fractured society, CityStep uses dance and creative collaboration to build mutual understanding among children of different backgrounds, incomes, neighborhoods,” she says. “It's that mutual understanding… that community-building…. Those are the building blocks of why I think CityStep has such impact on young people and has such impact, potentially, on society.”
It takes two to tango—or to put on a play, or to harmonize. As Harvard’s student artists reach wider and wider audiences, we’ll be hearing the resonance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Urban Dictionary defines “Bone Apple Tea” as “like when the food hella good and you bout to eat it you say bone apple tea its like french or some shit.” The Crimson defines “bone apple tea” as a colloquial form of “bon appetit,” often paired with pictures of pathetically prepared food (i.e. a naked Ken doll in a bowl of water and uncooked pasta, trying to pass as “Chick-Ken-Nude-Doll Soup”). The failure to spell “bon appetit” correctly seems to mimic the failure of these dishes.
Buzzfeed reports that the origins of “Bone Apple Tea” can be traced back to another similar saying, “Bone App the Teeth.” Apparently, someone posted a picture of piles of corn on slices of limp, white bread, captioning it “just made some cornbread, bone app the teeth.” The two phrases can be used interchangeably.
Since then, Twitter users have caught onto the trend. Even the popular pancake house Denny’s has contributed, with a photo of a whole coconut lying on a stack of pancakes in a black take-out box. Many of these pictures also tend to have puns, as suggested by the “cornbread” and “Chic-Ken-Nude-Doll Soup.” Cameron Baird (@Cb123Baird) shared a picture of multicolored Sour Patch Kids lying on a piece of wheat bread, calling it “sourdough bread” and finishing off the tweet with the familiar “bone app the teeth.” Others do not necessarily rely on wordplay, but have gained massive popularity since: A goldfish cracker lying on a bed of rice passing off as sushi earned 44,000 retweets since October 12; Liz Bien’s “delicious vegan lunch for [her] daughter”—a Ziploc of air with a straw stuck through it—received over 2,000 retweets. A pale waffle covered in purple Dawn dish soap has 1,134 likes and counting. And like some of these examples may suggest, not all of these dishes are edible. Ezekiel (@kawiizeke) posted a picture of man going headfirst into a stove pot, his body stick straight. Bone app the teeth?
Ezekiel’s contribution, though rather jarring at first glance, highlights the undercurrent anxiety present in all of these pictures. While these photos may poke fun at inadequate cooking skills, they seem to suggest a legitimate fear of not actually being able to make decent food. As people venture away from their parents’ homes, they also give up the comfort of home-cooked food and pre-packed lunches and suddenly must cook for their own survival. Though Harvard students are spoon-fed by our unlimited meal plans, we will join the rest of our age group eventually in the struggle to prepare meals that are not Matcha-flavored Pocky sandwiches, or burned toast, however easy those may be. Sure, we may laugh as we retweet “bone apple tea” memes now. But in a few years, will we be fondly looking back on HUDS’s catch-of-the-day entrees, wishing we took “bone apple tea” seriously?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The gentle strums of a ukulele opened “Oz,” Harvard Ballet Company’s fall offering. Israel Kamakawiwo’ole’s dreamy rendition of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” floated through the theater as the dancers began. Their gestures were yearning and explorational. They began and ended the first dance on the ground, with their hands folded mute and uniform. But in the space between, they reached their hands up towards the sky and stretched their arms and necks to make birdlike shapes.
“Oz” is ostensibly a retelling of the “Wizard of Oz.” There was a delightful Dorothy with her pigtails and blue skirt and red ruby slippers (in this case, socks), and her three fabled compatriots: the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. There were the whimsical Emerald City citizens decked out in mint green and chocolate, bouncing about to the percussive sounds of tap dance. There was the pristine Good Witch of the North, who smiled a large cheesy smile at the end of a conventional prima ballerina solo, and there was the angular, languidly powerful bravura of the Wicked Witch of the West. And of course there was the grand Wizard himself. But the ballet went beyond this rehashing of familiar figures. It took advantage of the story’s remarkably flexible iconography to turn “Oz” into a fresh meditation on personal journey and authenticity.
The centerpiece of “Oz” was its elegant reimagining of the Yellow Brick Road in the transitions between dances. In these recurring interludes, single soloists dressed in black danced to the sound of “Mishima/Closing,” an excerpt from Philip Glass’s String Quartet No. 3, under a spotlight filtered through an abstract brick road pattern. With each new soloist’s interpretation the repeating music seemed to deepen in both familiarity and mystery.
The ballet concluded with two scenes that diverged significantly from the original story, called “To Dwell: There’s No Place Like Home,” and “Paper Trails: Self-Discovery.” In these last two scenes the dancers shed any vestige of the magic and colors of the Oz dreamland. This stylistic transition was made less jarring by its foreshadowing in the tornado scene, in which dancers dressed in gray moved angularly and chaotically to Alfred Schnittke’s metallic, off-kilter Gogol Suite. And the interludes, with music that so well evoked a yearning, searching mood, made a finale titled “Paper Trails: Self-Discovery” thematically fitting, although some of the symbolism grew more abstruse towards the end.
The ballet took its most poignant and unexpected turn with the unmasking of the Wizard. The scene opened with the dancers wearing black, stony-faced masks and the leader directing them to move in a uniform, march-like fashion. All the masked dancers bent at the waist with their hands clasped demurely behind their backs. The Wizard seemed to hide behind his position as leader of these masked, de-individualized marchers. The ballet took liberties with the original story to great effect, imagining that a beautiful relationship between Dorothy and the Wizard blossomed as Dorothy encouraged the Wizard to remove the mask, to be real and vulnerable.
The ballet turned this unmasking gesture into something that might resonate with an audience full of Harvard students. In the penultimate scene the dancers said aloud together the popular self-empowering slogan, “You are enough.” It was surprising to hear a human voice in the theater, and the audience had a clear view of the directors’ vision for this retelling of “Oz.”
The slogan “you are enough” seemed to manifest itself in Dorothy, who in the “Friendship Quartet” scene danced to the sounds of Simon & Garfunkel singing, “Got no deeds to do, / No promises to keep. / I’m dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep. / Let the morning time drop all its petals on me. / Life, I love you, / All is groovy.” The choreography for Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion was full of skipping, tripping, exploring, and simply taking in the wonders of the colorful landscape. The dancers created a dream world somewhere over the rainbow on the stage and encouraged the audience to take some of this wide-eyed spirit with them even after the show had ended.

“It ain’t about nothing else except getting out alive.” When Lethu A. Ntshinga ’18, as Zeus, growls these words late in the production of “Polaroid Stories,” it is easy to believe her. She and a number of other talented actors have spent the majority of the last two hours demonstrating just how hard surviving on the streets can be. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s show, running from Oct. 21 to 29, is a gritty portrait of the lives of drug addicts and runaways. Set in the underbelly of an unnamed but menacing city, the show somewhat messily interweaves city life with classical themes drawn mostly from Ovid. While the nonlinear structure and conceptual ambition are overwhelming at times, director Jacqui Parker’s show, bolstered by its mostly freshman cast, forcefully imparts the pain and pathos of life on the street.
This year’s Visiting Director’s Project defies narrative convention, moving in a disjointed fashion from the story of one character to the next. “Polaroid Stories” is just that—snapshots from the lives of nine characters, all of whom wrestle with poverty and drug abuse. A tenth character, Philomel (Desmond L. Green ’17, Hannah Lemmons ’20, Sarah B. Rossman ’19, and Madeleine Snow ’20) plays the part of a chorus, whose echoing voice enhances the tension of a number of scenes. Inspired by the “Metamorphoses” and interviews conducted with prostitutes and homeless youth, “Polaroid Stories” does its best to meld the drama of classical myth with the real-life turmoil of destitution. Sometimes the idea falls flat, especially within dialogue, where classical references dropped in between nearly constant slang and vulgarities feel forced. References are, for much of the production, a sufficiently minor part of the action that the play remains accessible to those who deferred to Sparknotes when Ovid appeared on the high school reading list.
Whatever Parker does conceptually, she has managed to pull impressive performances from the large cast. One particularly dynamic performance comes from Skinheadboy (Cole V. Edick ’17) as a reckless, joking speed addict; his acting hits its peak, as is often the case with performances in this production, with his monologue close to the end.  Similarly, Rory Wakeford ’20 as Skinheadgirl successfully affects the terror of someone quickly losing herself to the life of the street. Also impressive is the raw, angry energy between the world weary Eurydice (Enosa Ogbeide ’20) and the raging, desperate Orpheus (Derek P. Speedy ’18), in a reimagining of the classical couple as a sketch of animosity and codependence. However, the show stealer is Semele/Persephone (Chloe A. Brooks ’19, an inactive Crimson arts editor), whose junkie snarl is frighteningly convincing. She also shines in lighter moments, as when playing off Dionysus (an energetic Julius Wade ’20). The back and forth between Narcissus (Bobby Malley ’20) and Echo (Rachel Kahn ’20) also helps to prevent the show from plunging too deeply into its darkest elements; their delivery and pace provide some of the most fun in this production.  Rounding off the mains is Ntshinga as a leering version of Zeus whose saxophone skills provide some much needed comic relief in the second act.
The production features some bizarre special effects: Aggressive lighting changes flood the stage in blue or red light, the use of intermittent music continues between unconnected scenes, and the sound of a disembodied heartbeat is superimposed over dialogue. The number and nature of these theatrical tricks could have easily come across as gimmicky, but they are generally effective in setting a mood without obscuring the actors on the stage. The set is versatile and intelligently conceived; the stage is split between a park bench, a digital screen (used to incorporate video clips into the show), a pier, and a stripped down bedroom. The selection of these elements for the backdrop allows for a smooth transition between wildly disparate scenes.
“Polaroid Stories” can boast of excellent work from its ensemble in general, especially when given the opportunity to show off deftness in repartee or skill in monologue. Further, the unusual set and special effects underscore the acting rather than taking away from it. The structure, meant to consist of brief vignettes from the characters’ lives rather than a cohesive narrative arc, might leave audiences scratching their heads; but in the end, the scramble doesn’t take away from the power of the actors telling the story. The conviction and honesty with which the violence and ugliness of poverty and addiction are portrayed on stage overcome the faults of the production, illuminating just how complicated “getting out alive” is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 16, pianist, composer, educator, and social activist Danilo Pérez, brought the Jazz 100 ensemble back home to the Greater Boston area, where the program had kicked off earlier in September. The show assembled some of the most accomplished jazz players of our time to celebrate the 100th birthdays of four jazz legends: Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Mongo Santamaria, and Thelonious Monk. In the acoustically impeccable, dimly purple-lit Sanders Theatre, Perez’s ensemble created flawless renditions of some of jazz history’s greatest tunes.
Danilo Perez served as Goodwill Ambassador at the United Nations Children's Fund, and currently serves as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Artist for Peace. His musical works are known for the social-humanitarian overtone they carry, and it was no different at this performance. The program reflected on the role of music to promote solidarity in the collective struggle for peace, the civil rights movement being one of the main focuses. “We shall overcome!” boomed Martin Luther King’s voice before Lizz Wright came on stage to perform Ella Fitzgerald’s “It’s Up to You and Me”—a tribute to King for his lifetime work on human rights. Later that night, Perez narrated a short incident from his time working with Gillespie, asking the latter what he wanted to achieve with his music. “I want to make music that can create a culture of passport, so that through it, all of humanity can come together,” Perez said, quoting Gillespie. This response succinctly captures the philosophy that Perez has followed fervently to the present day.
Realizing Perez’s vision was a carefully chosen ensemble comprising virtuosos playing each instrument, from world-class soloist Chris Potter on the tenor saxophone to SFJAZZ Collective’s Avishai Cohen on the trumpet. Percussionist Roman Diaz, a native of Havana, explored the African origins of jazz music with his loud, powerful chants as he furiously tapped away at the bongo. At several points in the show he was not only commanding the performance with intermittent chants but also involving the audience, who immediately responded to his calls. Wycliffe Gordon on the trombone took the stage with Gillespie’s “Ow!”—the mesmerizing muting-unmuting of his instrument reminding the audience of his work with the legend himself.
Perez gave a generous and well-deserved introduction to Lizz Wright, whose vocal performance was arguably the highlight of the evening. Her rich, majestic voice rose steadily, unwavering as she sang Fitzgerald’s classic “How High the Moon” in a less upbeat, more modern arrangement. When performing “Shiny Stockings,” another Fitzgerald tune, her voice resonated soulfully around the theater and Fitzgerald’s jolly spirit came to life, as Wright even did the signature childish giggle with which the former’s vivacious personality was always associated.
Near the end of the performance, Perez managed to play a witty trick on the audience. After the players bowed and the audience responded with thunderous applause, Perez reappeared on stage just as many got up to leave, grinning, and in an “Aha!” moment, remarked in his Panamanian accent, “So you fell for the trick, I see!” The rest of the ensemble reappeared and presented a masterful rendering of Monk’s “Four in One.” As the standing crowd followed Diaz’s powerful chants, the show finally came to an end—certainly a fitting tribute to the legends.

The Harvard Radcliffe Modern Dance Company’s new show “40,” proves that at their middle age, the dance troupe is as graceful as it’s ever been and promises many more decades of inspired modern dance. A tribute to the organization’s 40th anniversary, the performance bridged the past and the present with 11 pieces that each took inspiration from their past productions but featured completely new choreography by both current students and returning alumni. The show incorporated both popular songs by the likes of Frank Ocean and Kanye West and poetry and music composed by students. Every piece was stunning in its own right, and the contrast among the dances contributed to the show’s overall success.
“40” began with “Pandemonium”, a piece choreographed by Jazmine K. Phillips-Acie ’18, which featured Kanye West’s “Wolves” and Lorde’s “Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” It was an intense piece to start the show, as it depicted a power struggle amongst the dancers, who fought for a coveted scepter. The only flaw in “Pandemonium” was the often too literal interpretation of the lyrics; cut the music, rather than the choreographer’s vision, seemed to be the author of the piece. However, in every other way, Phillips-Acie showcased brilliant craftsmanship. The drastic transition from Kanye to Lorde and the kaleidoscopic changing light schemes contributed to the sense of perfectly balanced chaos. Together, the lights, music, and choreography created a dramatic uneasiness, as if the dancers’ world were just barely on the verge of pandemonium, suspended momentarily in this beautiful instant of competition. The following dance, “In Transit” by Gabe S. Martinez ’18, offered a stark contrast, with the cool tones in both costumes and lighting lifting the tension the previous performance had created. Throughout the show, this pattern repeated itself—stress followed by tranquility, heartbreak followed by joy.
Another highlight of the first act was “With Intent” by Joel W. Bateman ’17, featuring Frank Ocean’s “Solo.” The eight dancers in Bateman’s piece wore simple Adidas track pants and white T-shirts, which drew more attention to the dancers’ body language. Teeming with emotion, the word was a beautiful portrait of the pain of a breakup. The end was a solo that continued after the lights turned off, which reinforced the feeling of loneliness.
A less successful piece of the night was “Reconfigured” by Julia Sweeney ’19, which was uncomfortable in an interesting but somewhat overwrought fashion. The piece began with a solo dancer who performed frequent, uncontrollable convulsions of his limbs. As more dancers entered the stage, they fell prey to similar struggles, such as beating their heads against their palms and various twitches. While the piece consisted of three distinct scenes, the dancers ultimately reverted to their bad habits. Had it been shorter, “Reconfigured” would have had more provocative power. However, the piece was so long that eventually it pushed past the uncomfortable and simply became disturbing.
Sofie R. Seymour ’16 began the second act with her gorgeous reflections on mankind’s relationship with nature, “Enough Space.” The soothing earth tones of both lighting and costumes, along with the magnificent wooden headpiece that crowned Harvard Extension School student La’Toya Princess Jackson, set the scene in a forest. The dance ended with the other five dancers worshipping Jackson as Mother Nature in a cultish manner.
Two pieces in the second act incorporated other student artists: “Tempo” relied on the live performances of Laila M. Smith ’17, Carlos A. Snaider ’17, and Alex S. Graff ’17, who played original music by Tree A. Palmedo ’16, a former Crimson Arts executive, while “Excerpts” featured a poem by Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 and Yasmeen E. Audi ’15. The musicians in “Tempo,” who sat around the theater, came on and off stage and even sat in the audience, further emphasizing the theme of connecting past and present. However, the movements of the musicians at times also distracted slightly from the piece.
Ultimately, “40” contributed to a variety of ongoing conversations within the arts about topics such as nature, breakups, mental illness, and power. As a dance company, HRMDC entered these discussions in a unique way, using the human body as a voice for opinions. Moreover, it successfully brought together past artists to reinforce the idea that inspiration is cyclical and that creative energy can constantly be borrowed and repurposed.

After a four-year hiatus, TEATRO!, Harvard’s Spanish-language theater troupe, returns with “Nuestra Señora de las Nubes,” or “Our Lady of the Clouds.” The show explores the story of Oscar and Bruna, two political exiles from a fictional Latin American country, who learn to define their home in a world of constant hostility. Written in response to the Argentine Dirty War, the show is an original translation by director Nicolas E. O’Connor ’17. The play will run Oct. 28 to Nov. 5 at the Loeb Experimental Theater.
According to O’Connor, the endeavor of translation spanned almost five months, beginning in April and finishing in mid-September. During this time, O’Connor consulted with Vargas, who lives in Ecuador, where O’Connor was studying abroad.
Other than difficulties with translating puns and wordplay, O’Connor says, preserving the narrative tone in translation was especially challenging. “There’s always the traditional difficulty of trying to find the voice that exists,” he says. “It’s one thing to just straight translate it. Anyone who kind of knows the language can straight-translate it. But there’s a particular art to actually figuring out how the characters speak and how that’s going to be preserved in translation.”
In addition to translation, the unconventional character-to-cast ratio proved an interesting challenge. Though the show features 17 characters in total, the cast comprises only four actors who take on multiple roles throughout the show.
All of the actors in the cast are Latin American. “[The show] tells a very unique story [with] a unique Latinx perspective that other shows don’t really capture,” O’Connor said. “Other shows have tried… casting race-blind or gender-blind, but oftentimes if a Latinx person ends up in the show, it never ends up being the focus of the production. What’s interesting here is that it’s very much the focus.”
Besides its all-Latinx cast, the content of the show centers around an experience that will be familiar to Latin American students. The play will be a defining piece of theater for Latin American audiences typically underrepresented onstage, according to Danny L. Rodriguez ’18, the stage manager of the show and president of TEATRO!. “I feel like everyone should be able to have that option to see a show that they say, ‘This is me. This is my family,’” he said. “This is definitely the first show where I read the script and said, ‘Okay, I see myself in this show.’”
Rodriguez, who worked on shows with BlackCAST, says he noticed how race representation fostered a spirit of inclusion in the theater world among African American students. “I would love for this show and our next shows to have a similar effect on the Latin American community,” he said. “I want them to get excited and think, ‘Theater can be about us.’”
Thematically, the show will likely resonate with audiences who identify with the immigrant narrative. “It’s an experience very specific to someone who lived through the Argentine Dirty War and had to flee to another country, which also makes it relevant to the immigrant experience,” O’Connor said. “Just like people coming to the United States and not fitting in here…. A lot of the cast will tell you that they feel personally connected to it because they have a family member who had that experience or maybe [have had that experience] themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a year of the unexpected, one thing surprises me more than anything else: Cosmopolitan America is trying to take the white working class seriously.
The white working class has spoken. It spoke for Bernie Sanders and it spoke for Donald Trump. And so in the run-up to Election Day, the media’s been churning out feature after feature on “forgotten middle America.” Even Foreign Affairs is getting in on the action!
But at Harvard, cosmopolitan America’s most famous training ground, while there are plenty of Sanders voters to be found, there are almost no Trump supporters at all.
You’d think that Harvard would try to understand Trumpism better—it’s chock-full of sympathetic, unobjectionable liberals who often agree with Trump on free trade and campaign finance. But Harvard the University has trouble processing the Trump phenomenon because Harvard the Admissions Office and Harvard the Research Institution are not particularly interested in the archetypal white working-class Trump voter. The last 18 months have demonstrated that the sentiment is wholly reciprocated. And that’s a shame, because Harvard has so much to contribute to our understanding of Trump’s rise.
The first bone Trump’s original base has to pick with Harvard is that it is unrepresentative, particularly with respect to them. The slogan of Trumpism is “unfair”—unfair racial preferences, unfair trade deals, unfair Supreme Court decisions, unfair elections, unfair everything. And the truth is that if working-class and lower-middle-class Trumpites (in my experience, the most fervent kind of Trump supporter), understood how unrepresentative Harvard is they would try to burn it to the ground.
Income is a popular talking point, and last year, the median Harvard senior was raised in a household making more than $125,000 a year. That’s two and a half times greater than the national median.
Moreover, if there’s a working-class student at Harvard, that person’s very unlikely to be white. We can argue whether race-based affirmative action is a good thing. We cannot deny that the way Harvard does it, race-based affirmative action disproportionately hurts the white working class because it is not coupled with a sufficient commitment to economically based affirmative action. Poor white people are just as incapable of paying for test prep as poor minorities, after all. If you don’t see classic Trump voters around campus, it’s not because they don’t want to be here, it’s because we won’t let them in. Last year, only 8.9 percent of white Harvard seniors were first-generation college students (not a perfect stand-in for class, but close enough). This is even smaller than the figure for South Asians (10 percent), the single wealthiest ethnic group in the United States. (If you were wondering, Hispanics are at 33 percent.) With barely any representation from Trump’s demographic base, how exactly can a student community like Harvard’s approach the Trump phenomenon in any intellectually rigorous way? As prejudiced as many of Trump’s views have been, if we are not going to provide a forum where we can approach them head-on, we are not going to figure out how to change anybody’s minds. That process starts with taking an honest look at why Trumpites vote the way they do. We can’t do that without actually meeting Trump voters, and students just can’t do that here. If we brought in more students who are demographically likelier to vote Trump, we’d dim the flames of Trumpism a little, and we’d learn about Trump voters a lot.
The second big issue is that Trumpism is in large part a rejection of experts, and in 2016 Trump’s voters fervently rejected the sort of policy wonks that tend to congregate at places like Harvard. The kneejerk reaction is to cry anti-intellectualism. There’s still more to it than that.
Speaking broadly, Trump’s base doesn’t feel like Harvard has the answers they need. If I might hazard a suggestion, it’s because Harvard has chosen to focus on the plights of minorities far more discrete and insular than the white working class. A university whose human-studies professors predominantly specialize in ethnic studies or critical legal studies (or, for that matter, in computer science or art history or financial modeling) is hardly the sort of school that is best placed to understand the rise of Donald Trump. And it’s not just Harvard—across the board, grant funding in sociology and anthropology is rarely going to go to somebody who wants to study the plight of the lower-middle- or working-class white American. But if you were looking for a university with the prestige and the resources to buck that trend, you’d probably put your finger on a school like Harvard. The new trend might as well start with us.
Even now we can make a difference. Harvard does have people who can shed light, little by little, on how the Trump base feels. We have economists who can talk about wage stagnation and sociologists who’ve explored the soaring price of rent. We have policy experts in every field known to man. But as Colin Powell noted, coaches who have never played lack a certain credibility, and most of our professors did not come from the white working class. Even fewer have devoted their careers to studying it specifically.
The credibility issue can’t be solved overnight. (It doesn’t help that New England’s universities have the most liberal faculties in the country by a factor of five.) But even coaches who have never played the game can win over their players with success. We need to offer clear, coherent, and actionable answers to the problems of the white working class—and so far we have failed to provide them.
Until that happens, I leave you with the fact that the American university was not ready for Donald Trump in 2016. And I’m not sure we’re going to be ready for him in 2020.
Perhaps somebody will understand why Trump voters feel the way they do, connect with them, and channel their energies into a different direction. But all the evidence suggests that the person to do this will not be found at Harvard.

While the rest of the Harvard community is busy speaking out against gender-based violence and working to create a more inclusive campus, this past Saturday, Harvard Business School proudly hosted the man who has become the most visible leader of a powerful, procrustean movement against women and the BGLTQ community in Colombia: former president Alvaro Uribe, who gave a keynote speech at the 19th Annual Latin America Conference. This is his second invited speech at Harvard this year, and his fourth in five years. Less than two years ago, the Law School’s Program on Negotiation extended an invitation to another architect of this movement’s agenda to disenfranchise women and the BGLTQ population, former Inspector General Alejandro Ordoñez. It seems as though some of Harvard’s institutions have a curious fascination with hearing from misogynistic and homophobic Colombian leaders. Unfortunately, this predilection may be getting in the way of its educational mission.
Since the end of his presidency in 2010, Uribe has been the undisputed leader of the opposition to the government, and a vocal critic of the peace process ever since it was first announced in 2012. Ordoñez—an unapologetic burner of "immoral magazines and books" and ardent opponent of sexual and reproductive rights who served as Inspector General from 2009 to 2016 (when he was deposed on charges of corruption and other irregularities)—is one Uribe’s closest political allies. Uribe and Ordoñez have rallied a militant, sexist, and homophobic constituency that has become a decisive political force in Colombia. Their movement proudly claims to have contributed over two million votes against the peace agreement between the government and the FARC guerrillas in the recent plebiscite. This constituency—which succeeded in bringing down the peace accords by a margin of less than 54,000 votes—galvanized around Uribe’s and Ordoñez’s propaganda that the agreement promoted gay marriage, “homosexual dictatorships,” and “gender ideologies.” However, “gender ideology” does not feature anywhere in the text of the agreement. Rather, Uribe and Ordoñez distorted its progressive gender focus, which seeks to address the specific forms of violence faced by women—the demographic most affected by the conflict—and BGLTQ victims during the country’s 50-year civil war.
The defeat of the accords is largely the culmination of a programmatic agenda to roll back hard-won minority rights. Earlier this year, in reaction to a decision by Colombia’s  Constitutional Court legalizing same-sex marriage and making it easier for same-sex couples to adopt children, Uribe and his supporters organized massive protests across the country denouncing gender-inclusive education programs and other “sexual garbage” in public schools, and demanding a return to “traditional” family values. As Inspector General Ordoñez defied the Constitutional Court’s rulings by obstructing women’s rights to an abortion in cases involving rape, danger to the mother’s health, or fatal fetal abnormalities, and initiating judicial actions against judges and public notaries performing same sex marriages. Both men used the fear generated by the peace process to advance discrimination and promote their political agendas for the 2018 presidential election. These actions are in opposition to Harvard’s mission—as stated by the Office of BGLTQ Student Life—to create a more inclusive campus by engaging and educating the University community “about the multiplicity of sexual and gender identities.”
Most troubling about Harvard's evident fascination with hearing from Uribe and Ordoñez is the apparent lack of interest in examining their controversial views and their illiberal agenda. Advertisements of their visits celebrate Uribe’s apparent successes in promoting economic growth and Ordoñez’s ostensible achievements at combating corruption. No mention is made about the fact that their political capital is largely built on misogyny, homophobia, bigotry, and human rights abuses, despite the fact that Colombian students and allies have consistently highlighted these silences.
On Saturday, these matters were only addressed as a result of the peaceful student rally outside HBS conveying messages of urgency and peace to Uribe, which spurred an impromptu Q&A. When asked to define “gender ideology” and indicate its places in the agreements, Uribe blamed the negotiators for not being clear in their speeches about the difference between “ideology” and “focus,” failing to identify where the articles reference such ideology. He deflected further questions by asking that they be directed to Ordoñez.
Perhaps those who keep inviting Uribe are stubbornly unaware of political dynamics in Colombia; a more generous interpretation is that they are simply more interested in the economy and other such matters. Whatever the reason, in failing to recognize and engage with Uribe and Ordoñez’s illiberal agenda, Harvard is failing to fulfill its core educational mission. Not only does this lack of engagement raise questions about the University as a place for critical thinking, it also suggests that the University endorses a certain order of priorities with respect to what is worth discussing amongst policymakers and business-minded people. Apparently, there is no time to waste on sexual and gender-based violence or minority rights—let alone deliberating about the ethics of leadership—when economic growth is on the agenda. Is this how Harvard puts into practice its mission of educating the citizen leaders of tomorrow’s world? We have to ask ourselves what message this sends to students who are female or who identify as BGLTQ. Silencing Uribe and Ordoñez’s disenfranchising agenda ultimately limits the possibilities of building an inclusive and non-discriminatory community at Harvard and beyond.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Antiguan Ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Sanders, asked Harvard to follow in Georgetown’s footsteps and provide reparations to Antigua and Barbuda, citizens of which are descendants of slaves previously owned by the Royall family whose donation funded the University's first law professorship. Sanders argued that since the profits of Antiguan slave plantations helped finance Royall’s founding gift to the Law School, Harvard has an outstanding debt to the country and ought to offer special annual scholarships  to Antiguan students or provide monetary support for the building of  Antigua’s first university.
While we agree that Harvard should aspire to atone for its discomfiting history with slavery, we do not believe that pursuing Antiguan-specific reparations is the most efficacious approach. As a university with ties to many historical injustices, Harvard ought not to be pursue debts of symbolic merit. Rather, it should be tackling continued, systematic injustices with broad, systematic solutions. Harvard’s imperative of institutional change dwarfs the particularities of this injustice.
For slavery was, unfortunately, anything but endemic to Antigua and Barbuda. It constituted intricate part of the American economic system, and Harvard and the rest of this nation reaped the benefits of the labor of innumerable nameless slaves. A remedy is owed to the entire Black community, which still faces tremendous disparities in income, health, safety, and educational opportunity. Harvard ought to continue to pursue race-guided admissions policies and pay close attention to the educational access available to various students.
Antigua does, however, serve as a vivid example of a country that has been so ruined by slavery that it does not even have an institution of higher learning. As part of a greater international system, Harvard’s actions will continue to impact the world.  Harvard must to continue its financial aid assistance and realize that despite its current financial offerings, talented Antiguans still rely on government funds to attend.
Moreover, though Harvard should not implement preferred admission or scholarships for Antiguans, it should still consider Antigua’s call for help in building a university of its own. Harvard’s substantial technical and administrative expertise will allow it to help Antigua establish itself with the funding that it can receive from Harvard and elsewhere.
As Harvard moves further away from its past, we hope it will continue to remember that the slavery casts a long and dark shadow over its institutional history, and that racial and systematic discrimination continues to strongly cut the opportunities for achievement not only for African-Americans, but also the wider international world, which is structured to reflect the disfigured realities left from practices such as colonialism. As an institution that has profited from inequality, Harvard needs to use its admissions practices, financial aid, and other resources to guide the world towards a better future.

Illuminated jack-o-lantern orange from below, the Lowell bells shatter the nighttime hush. Craning my neck to see the tower, I feel tiny and just a little anxious about the onset of tinnitus. The bells seem to slice through the air of their own accord until I catch sight of first a spectral hand, then a looming figure. With clothing as black as night, his head seems to float against the starless sky.
This figure is not, at least to my knowledge, performing an exorcism on the Lowell bells. His name is Father Roman, and, as hierodeacon of the Danilov monastery, he’s come to tutor a new generation of disciples in the ancient art of Russian bell-ringing. If there’s any black magic involved, he doesn’t care to mention it in our conversation—or maybe I ask the wrong questions.
“I sometimes can look frightening,” Father Roman says the next day. “I do not mean to cause these faces of fear.” I laugh, as if I can’t imagine being scared by him. Certainly, on this cloudless morning, he doesn’t look occult: He smiles in a way that sends his eyebrows shooting up under his cap, and his blue eyes twinkle. Yet I’m keenly conscious of how intimidating the expanse of wiry red beard and floor-sweeping black robe seemed the evening before, when I tried to look at his face and couldn’t see past his chest. It was oddly reminiscent of gazing up at the bell tower.
Both he and it are, for the moment, quiet. I don’t know if I’m just too enamored of my own analogy, but I am surprised when his voice lacks any sonorous quality—it does the opposite of reverberate, and I have to lean in to catch his thoughtful murmur. His black robes, less stark in the sunshine, are complemented by black shoes, a black coat, a black cap. I catch a glimpse of a black watchband under his sleeve; he has a black rolling suitcase by his side. The color lies in his huge red beard and in his art.
His primary artistic medium is bell-ringing, but Father Roman loves painting, too. “When you ring bells, you combine tones, like paints, into a sound picture,” he says. “Both are a way to express your inner world, to hear colors.”
Bell-ringing, to Father Roman, is a marriage of art and science: campanology. “As a subject, it’s quite narrow,” he concedes, before launching into a summary of campanological theory. He’s well-versed, having studied at music school for seven years. He subsequently participated in and conducted a choir, and he conducts his own campanological research, all to promote the “very special” knowledge of “the language of the bells.” He hopes to spread it here, as part of the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers’ cultural exchange.
Bells are not Father Roman’s sole purpose in visiting, though. “I also like American nature,” he says earnestly, and for one hopeful moment I think that he’s complimenting our collective personality. “I mean natural parks and different landscapes,” he clarifies, and gestures around us at the damp greenery of Lowell courtyard. He aims to spend some time in a different national park every time he visits Harvard—call it inspiration, if you will, for his responsibility as landscape architect for his monastery. For this trip, his 10th, “I think Yosemite.”
He is “first a deacon,” second a campanologist, but bell-ringing is nonetheless his passion.  Having grown up in the suburbs of Moscow, he rang his first bells at the age of 13 for church services, but didn’t grow to love them until he came to the Danilov monastery and was appointed bell ringer there. He helped to found a bell-ringing center in Moscow and was crucial to restoring the Danilov bells to their rightful home from Harvard. (The current Lowell bells are replicas, installed in 2008.)
When I ask him why he plays the bells, he seems almost pained, or at least I assume that’s what the sudden halt in his thumb-twiddling signifies. I’m about to venture another question, worried that I’ve upset him, when he finally speaks. “Playing the bells, trying something new—it makes you a better person,” he says.
I try something new by witnessing one of Father Roman’s bell-ringing workshops. Part of one, anyway. I intend to try more new somethings and attend the lesson in its entirety, but I underestimate the number of steps required to scale the belfry. (Learn from my mistake: It’s 128.) By the time I’ve surmounted the last narrow metal ladder, I’m too winded to celebrate, and wordlessly join the small group watching from the corner as Father Roman and his team conclude their lesson.
They give the largest central bell a final, judicious tug that makes my teeth chatter. In one choreographed movement, as if a signal were given, everyone present rises and rests a palm on the swaying behemoth. I am hypnotized and have to be prodded to my feet. I expect the bell to buzz angrily under my fingers, a bee trapped by a window—but the giant bell purrs under my hand.
The thrum continues for what feels like whole minutes, hanging electric in the evening air. Finally, Father Roman clears his throat. “I have to go pick my friend up from the airport,” he says sheepishly.
Just like that, the spell is broken: He is no longer an enchanter working his magic over these great cacophonous creatures. He’s just another guy trying to figure out the Silver Line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 25, 2016, at 3:18 a.m.
Monday marked a showing of force in support for Harvard’s dining services workers as more than a hundred students and supporters flooded the lobby where negotiations between the University and HUDS’s union took place.
After roughly 500 students walked out of classes and rallied in Harvard Yard, more than 100 students and supporters of Harvard’s picketing dining services workers sat in the lobby of 124 Mt. Auburn St., singing, and chanting—and, eventually, doing homework—for nearly seven hours.
Harvard’s dining workers have picketed for nearly three weeks, demanding the University increase their wages and maintain their current health benefits.
Students had planned to occupy the building until Harvard’s negotiating team came to a “fairer resolution” with the union, Gabe G. Hodgkin ’18, an organizer with Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement, said earlier in the afternoon.
Indeed, Harvard and UNITE HERE Local 26, the union representing HUDS employees, did reach a tentative agreement early Tuesday morning. Though Local 26 President Brian Lang did not provide details, he said the agreement “accomplished all of our goals.” That agreement must first be sent to a 30-member bargaining subcommittee Tuesday, he said, before the full membership of dining workers in the union vote on the deal Wednesday.
The lobby was near capacity at about 3 p.m. when the sit-in began, as students sporadically broke into protest songs and chanted “We love HUDS” while bemused office workers looked on from above. Roughly 100 HUDS workers, union members, and supporters demonstrated outside the building initially, dwindling to nearly a dozen by 10:30 p.m., when police asked demonstrators inside the building to leave.
The demonstration at 124 Mt. Auburn St. followed a rally Monday afternoon at 2 p.m. in which roughly 500 students walked out of class in a show of support for striking dining services workers, the second such walkout of the nearly three-week long strike. 
The crowd of supporters gathered around the John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard, where Jonathan S. Roberts ’17, the first student speaker, urged continued action as workers spent their 20th day on picket lines.
“They’re not on strike to hurt us or to hurt the community, they’re on strike because they understand what their rights are,” Roberts said.
Dining hall employee Anabela A. Pappas also addressed the crowd in the Yard and thanked the students for their support.
“First and foremost I want to thank the students who have been side by side fighting with us,” Pappas said. “My coworkers and I would not be here without you.”
At 10:30 p.m. in 124 Mt. Auburn St., Aaron J. Duckett, a dining services worker who attended Monday’s negotiations, addressed students and said both bargaining units “made a lot of headway” that evening.
“The specifics we can’t get into… but we have a little bit more work to do upstairs right now,” Duckett said to the roughly 50 students remaining in the building near 10:30 p.m. “I feel like we’re on the right path.”
Earlier in the day, The Boston Globe’s editorial board called on Harvard to meet its dining workers’ demands, and one dining hall employee—Rosa Ines Rivera—shared her story in a New York Times op-ed entitled “Struggling to Serve at the Nation’s Richest University.” Both articles came after a weekend of fervent activism, and a roughly 1,000 person march in support of dining services workers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what appears to have been a yearly team tradition, a member of Harvard’s 2012 men’s soccer team produced a document that, in sexually explicit terms, individually assessed and evaluated freshmen recruits from the 2012 women’s soccer team based on their perceived physical attractiveness and sexual appeal.
The author and his teammates referred to the nine-page document as a “scouting report,” and the author circulated the document over the group’s email list on July 31, 2012.
In lewd terms, the author of the report individually evaluated each female recruit, assigning them numerical scores and writing paragraph-long assessments of the women. The document also included photographs of each woman, most of which, the author wrote, were culled from Facebook or the Internet. 
The author of the “report” often included sexually explicit descriptions of the women. He wrote of one woman that “she looks like the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated.”
Each woman was assigned a hypothetical sexual “position” in addition to her position on the soccer field.
“She seems relatively simple and probably inexperienced sexually, so I decided missionary would be her preferred position,” the author wrote about one woman. “Doggy style,” “The Triple Lindy,” and “cowgirl” were listed as possible positions for other women.
The author also assigned each woman a nickname, calling one woman “Gumbi” because “her gum to tooth ratio is about 1 to 1.”
“For that reason I am forced to rate her a 6,” the author added.
“She seems to be very strong, tall and manly so, I gave her a 3 because I felt bad. Not much needs to be said on this one folks,” the author wrote about another woman.
Concluding his assessment of one woman, the author wrote, “Yeah… She wants cock.”
The “report” appears to have been an annual practice. At the beginning of the document, the author writes that “while some of the scouting report last year was wrong, the overall consensus that” a certain player “was both the hottest and the most STD ridden was confirmed.”
Several members of the 2012 men’s team declined to comment on the document, including whether subsequent men’s soccer teams continued to create similar “reports.”
Before the document was sent out to the team, an older member had emailed the list ordering that “someone man up and send out a proper scouting report on the incoming freshman [sic] for girl’s team.” Responding to that email, another teammate addressed the author, writing “what the fuck where are you on this?”
When the document was sent, several members of the team responded to the email. One member expressed approval of the document, writing “hahahahaha well done.”
The document and the entire email list the team used that season were, until recently, publicly available and searchable through Google Groups, an email list-serv service offered through Google.
Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise viewed the document for the first time Monday and said he had been unaware of the document until then.
Directly after seeing the document, he said “Any time a member of our community says things about other people who are in our community that are disparaging, it takes away from the potential for creating the kind of learning environment that we’d like to have here at Harvard.”
He added: “It’s very disappointing and disturbing that people are doing this.”
Scalise said the document reflects issues that extend far beyond Harvard’s campus.
“We’re not insulated from these types of things,” he said. “These things exist in our society. Society hasn't figured out a way to stop these things from happening.”
“Whenever you have groups of people that come together there’s a potential for this to happen,” Scalise added.
“It could be an individual, it could be a group, it could be a rooming group, it could be an athletic team,” he said.
Pressed on whether the “scouting report” affected campus culture beyond impacting “the kind of learning environment” that Scalise described, he said “I don’t have a comment on that right now. I have to think about it a little.”
“We need a little bit of time to just think about it and not rush to anything,” Scalise said. “But it’s totally inappropriate and disturbing.”
Though Scalise said his first steps for responding to the document would “certainly” include speaking to coaches of both men’s and women’s athletic teams, he added that “there’s a role for the administration at the College to also play in this” in addition to the athletics department.
Any reaction to the document, though, should be “an internal Harvard matter,” Scalise said.
“This is not a media thing,” Scalise said. “This is something that should be looked at by us in the administration to figure out what our steps are, but we shouldn’t do anything more with the media on this other than ‘thank you for letting us know about this, okay. We need to look at it.’”
First contacted about the document late Friday afternoon, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana did not respond to multiple requests for an in-person meeting to view the document. College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that Khurana was unavailable for an in-person interview. Khurana instead emailed a statement, after Dane had viewed the document herself in person.
“As a human being, and a member of the Harvard College community, I am always profoundly disturbed and upset by allegations of sexism, because I feel it is wrong and antithetical to this institution’s fundamental values,” Khurana wrote. “No one should be objectified. In light of all the attention that has been given to issues of inclusion, gender equity, and personal integrity at Harvard and elsewhere, we must work together to build a community of which we can all be proud.”
Khurana also wrote that because “I was not Dean of Harvard College in 2012 and do not have knowledge of this particular email, I cannot speak to the alleged conduct of these particular students.”
Evelynn M. Hammonds, who was the Dean of the College in 2012, deferred comment to Dane.
“When I first heard of this report from the Crimson, I was shocked and disgusted,” wrote current Men’s Soccer Coach Pieter S. Lehrer in a statement provided by Director of Athletic Communications Tim Williamson. “I will take this opportunity to address this document from 2012 with my current athletes. I hope their seeing how offensive and hurtful this is will be a valuable lesson for everyone involved with this program.”
Neither Lehrer, who was not the men’s soccer coach at the time of the 2012 email, nor the team’s current captains responded directly to inquiries as to whether there were “reports” produced after 2012.
“The information contained in this document from 2012 is unacceptable, and I am saddened to see this level of disrespect shown to these women,” wrote Women’s Soccer Coach Christopher P. Hamblin in an emailed statement, adding that “since Coach Lehrer's hire in 2013, I have seen a huge shift in the culture of the men's soccer program at Harvard.”
The document, though written four years ago, surfaces amid a year at Harvard defined, in many ways, by campus discourse about gender equity and campus sexual harassment. It also comes at a time in which national conversations on the current presidential campaign focus on the same subject. After the surfacing of a 2005 tape in which Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump boasts about groping women, Trump dismissed his comments as “locker-room banter.”
In March, a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention released a report aiming to address what University President Drew G. Faust called a “troubling” climate of sexual misconduct on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of current and prospective Harvard College students have filed an amicus brief in support of Harvard’s race-conscious affirmative action policies in an ongoing lawsuit between Harvard and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, which is representing the group of current and prospective students, filed the brief last Wednesday in response to two motions Harvard filed in late September—one to dismiss two counts of the lawsuit and another to dismiss the lawsuit entirely.
The lawsuit began in 2014 after SFFA filed a complaint alleging Harvard’s affirmative action admissions policies disadvantage Asian American applicants. The group also alleges Harvard uses “racial quotas” and “racial balancing” in its policies. Harvard faculty and administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, have staunchly defended the University’s race-conscious admissions policies.
Matthew M. Cregor, one of the attorneys in the Lawyers’ Committee, said the legal group is working with the law firm of Arnold & Porter and the organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice to represent current and prospective students “who believe that Harvard should be allowed to conduct race-conscious admissions for the benefit of its student body.”
The 10-page brief argues the court should rule in favor of Harvard’s motion to dismiss two counts of the lawsuit because they contradict previous Supreme Court cases, including the recent Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin case, that have established the use of race-conscious admissions policies as constitutional.
Cregor said, “Our Supreme Court has only made clearer since the lawsuit has been filed that our colleges and universities are allowed to use race-conscious admissions to pursue a diverse campus.”
The Lawyers’ Committee first sought to intervene in the lawsuit last May, but the case’s presiding judge rejected the motion. The group received amicus status instead, allowing the group to submit briefs and participate in oral arguments at different points in the case.
“At any critical stage in the litigation, such as this one, we hope to weigh in in support of those students who value racial diversity at Harvard and the University’s ability to foster it,” Cregor said.
Meanwhile, the plaintiff in the case, Students for Fair Admissions, filed two memos over the weekend opposing Harvard’s motions to dismiss. In the memos, SFFA’s legal counsel argues Harvard has not followed rules of procedure by filing the dispositive motions ahead of the court’s schedule.
SFFA also claims that the two counts in contention are still relevant and could be supported by possible information uncovered in the process of discovery.
The court previously ordered Harvard to produce six cycles of admissions data in discovery, including applicant files from the 2009-2010 admissions cycle through to the 2014-2015 cycle. Harvard informed students of the use of their application information in an email sent on Oct. 13.
In a letter to the court, Felicia H. Ellsworth, one of the lawyers representing Harvard, wrote that a “number of applicants, students, and alumni” have objected to the the use of their application information, and the University has directed them to contact the court directly.
Spokespeople for Harvard’s Admissions Office and SFFA declined to comment on case developments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jose Antonio Vargas, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and activist for immigrant rights, shared his experiences growing up as an undocumented immigrant in the United States and critiqued the way American citizens view undocumented immigrants living in the country at an event Monday night.
The event, entitled “Define American: Humanizing the Immigration Debate” was co-hosted with the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and took place in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
Vargas came into the public spotlight in 2011 after he published an essay in the New York Times Magazine discussing his life in the United States as an undocumented immigrant. Having moved from the Philippines to live with his grandparents in Mountain View, Calif. when he was 12, Vargas did not know he was living in the United States illegally until he was 16 years old.
Shortly after the publication of his 2011 piece, Vargas called the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to ask why he had not been deported. He said he was told “the Department refuses to comment on specific cases.”
Vargas highlighted what he said were contradictions in the way the government and American citizens treat immigrants. He said that undocumented immigrants pay money to the government, yet the government spends almost as much to keep them out of the country.
“An estimated seven million undocumented workers have paid about $100 billion in Social Security taxes using fake Social Security numbers,” he said. “Yet since 9/11 we have invested $100 billion in border security.”
Vargas said Americans need to alter the way they understand immigration before being able to enter into an informed discussion on immigration policy. He said he thought the terminology the media uses to discuss immigration “dehumanizes and marginalizes immigrants.”
“Journalism schools are going to study the failure of the mainstream media of contextualizing [immigration]. We in the news media have bought into the story that Trump has sold the media,” Vargas said. “The New York Times doesn’t even talk about it. The framing of the issue has been wrong, just wrong.”
Vargas’s  remarks were well-received by members of the audience.
Zid N. Mancenido, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said, “I was so compelled when [Vargas] said white people need to have the conversation too about what immigration means to them.”
Alfredo Garcia Garza, a student at the Divinity School, said, “What I liked about the event was that he touched on the facts of imperialism and colonialism, which are usually left out of the conversation.”
Vargas graduated from San Francisco State University in 2004 and was a member of the  Washington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning team in 2008 for its coverage on the Virginia Tech shootings.

Amanda N. Nguyen ’13, founder and president of advocacy group Rise, criticized the lack of support the legal system affords sexual assault victims and emphasized young people’s ability to change that system during an address in Currier House Monday.
Nguyen has made national headlines in recent months for her advocacy for individuals who have been sexually assaulted. In early September, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act, which outlines legal rights for victims of sexual assault, including ensuring that rape kits are preserved until “the expiration of the maximum applicable statute of limitations.” The Senate version of the bill passed unanimously in May, and President Barack Obama signed the bill on Oct. 7.
“People don’t know how broken the criminal justice system is for survivors,” Nguyen said. “People don’t know that in some states survivors don’t have access to their medical information, people don’t know that in some states survivor’s rape kits are destroyed before the statute of limitations.”
It is rare for bills to pass at the federal level with such high levels of bipartisan support.
Nguyen, along with her partners at Rise, authored the bill. Rise also authored a similar bill that passed in the Massachusetts State House on Oct. 11 and was signed by the Massachusetts Governor on Oct. 19. The bill was inspired by Nguyen’s experiences navigating the criminal justice system as a victim of sexual assault.
Since the bill’s passage at the state and federal levels, 19 states have reached out to Rise to inform the group of their intent to pass similar pieces of legislation. Nguyen said Rise will be involved in the research and legislative processes in those states. Other nations, such as Japan, have also asked Rise to help write similar legislation.
A mix of College and graduate students attended the conversation, which was sponsored by Currier House Faculty Dean Latanya A. Sweeney.
Nguyen, who this past month left her job as Deputy White House Liaison at the State Department to dedicate herself full-time to her job at Rise, has previously worked at NASA and plans to become an astronaut.
“We can see the victory line, and that victory line is states taking those civil rights seriously,” Nguyen said. “Hope is contagious; if you are able to shine a spotlight on something that is a problem, you can solve it.”

Reflecting on his nearly three years as Boston’s mayor, Martin J. Walsh discussed his initiatives to advance diversity in government and his goals for the future of local governance, particularly in light of his bid for reelection in 2017, at the Kennedy School of Government on Monday night.
The Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership hosted the event, which was moderated by Patricia S. Bellinger ’83, executive director of the Center for Public Leadership.
Walsh discussed the ways in which his administration has revisited race and diversity in city hall and throughout Boston. Walsh said following his first campaign, he went back to his policy committee and sparked a conversation about addressing systemic racism.
“In Boston, we have a history of racism that goes back pre-busing… We never really dealt with the issue of busing, we never really dealt with the issue of race,” Walsh said. “My equity agenda is based on feedback I’ve received and constructive criticism.”
When asked about components of his agenda, Walsh first turned to residents’ distrust of policing in the city. According to Walsh, the Boston Police Department’s command staff did not reflect the city’s racial diversity. He sought to correct this issue in his first term by increasing the number of officers of color in the force.
Walsh added that the police department has also begun a pilot program in which 100 officers have been selected to wear body cameras to boost transparency and that officers are “more engaged with conflict resolution on the streets, rather than arresting people” in an effort to build trust between officers and residents.
He called the relationship between officers and residents a “two-way street” that involves teaching new officers about race and encouraging them to engage in community events.
Walsh’s vision of increasing diversity in city leadership positions has not been limited to the police force, but has also driven hiring practices in Boston city hall. He said he “[asked] every department head, every cabinet minister to really take a deep look inside government to be fully inclusive [and] to give people opportunities.”
He also emphasized the importance of building pipelines for minorities and marginalized groups to ascend the ranks in municipal government and said he hopes his precedent will “[challenge] the business community to look within its own ranks.”
Walsh extended this theme of diversity to several issues raised in a question and answer session. He also discussed other initiatives of his administration, such as pushing for increased female representation in government and creating additional affordable housing throughout the city.
While Walsh said his administration has made “some gains” in increasing diversity in local government during his tenure, he thinks there is still room for growth.
“I’m not afraid to try anything, because it’s important,” he said.

Four undergraduates debated Harvard’s new policy penalizing members of single-gender social organizations at a debate hosted by the Harvard Political Union Monday night, focusing arguments both for and against the policy on whether it will be effective in preventing sexual assault on campus.
The historic sanctions prohibit members of Harvard’s unrecognized single-gender social groups—such as final clubs and Greek organizations—from holding leadership positions in other clubs and teams and receiving College endorsement for fellowships. The policy, which University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in May, came after months of discussion about the College’s off-campus social scene, which many students have characterized as exclusive and discriminatory.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 and Tom Osborn ’20 argued in favor of the policy at the debate—which about 50 students attended in Harvard Hall—while Madeleine Lapuerta ’20 and Alexandra C. Tartaglia ’17 argued against it.
In their opening remarks, Lapuerta and Tartaglia said they considered the policy “disloyal” to the College’s stated mission: to educate citizens and citizen leaders. Khurana frequently cites this mission in speeches and emails to students, and has repeatedly said he finds single-gender social organizations at odds with that message.
“The sanctions… are unprecedented and disloyal to the very mission of this College,” Tartaglia said. “Ironically, many of the single-sex organizations are committed to the very same principles and ideals that Harvard stands for.”
Throughout the debate, the two characterized the sanctions as “paternalistic” and a “blanket solution” to sexual assault—a problem Faust called “deeply disturbing” last fall.
Arguing in favor of the policy in their opening statement, Osborn and Goldberg praised College administrators for taking steps to combat class and gender discrimination on campus, as well as a climate they said perpetuates sexual violence.
While both students and administrators have pointed to single-gender social groups—specifically all-male final clubs—as breeding grounds for misconduct, Lapuerta and Tartaglia said the sanctions would not be sufficient to stop sexual assault at final clubs or Greek organizations. A University report issued in March found that 47 percent of undergraduate women who “participated in final clubs”—including women who attend male final club events and seniors who are members of female final clubs—reported “experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college."
“We need to stop blaming the final clubs for rape culture. We need to blame rapists for rape culture,” Lapuente said. “The solutions to rape culture should not be regulation, it should be education on sexual assault, on what consent is, and what safe sex looks like.”
In response to Lapuente, Goldberg, arguing in favor of the sanctions, said she finds final clubs responsible for creating an environment where sexual assault can occur.
Goldberg and Osborn said they think the policy is necessary to combat what they characterized as unhealthy power structures between men and women and the gender binary perpetuated within club and Greek life culture.
Rape culture “includes individuals, but it also includes institutions and systems that make it possible for individuals to behave in this way,” Goldberg said. Goldberg added that she thinks events like fraternity-sorority mixers and date events enable an environment where sexual violence can happen.
The College recently announced the faculty chairs of a committee charged with recommending how to best roll out the policy when it goes into effect. The committee chairs recently hosted a public forum in which students aired questions and criticisms about the policy.

Over the past several weeks, Harvard faculty have shown their support for striking dining hall workers, bringing their classes to the picket lines and signing a petition—which has now garnered around 130 signatures—calling on Harvard to reach an agreement with its employees.
Early Tuesday morning Harvard and its dining workers did reach a “tentative agreement,” which, though not yet officially ratified, “accomplished all of our goals, Brian Lang, president of the union that represents HUDS workers, said.
The faculty petition—which History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy said began out of conversations he had with Kennedy School professors Richard Parker and Marshall L. Ganz after workers voted to strike—has circulated among faculty since the first week of the strike.
McCarthy said he worked with his former student and Gabriel H. Bayard ’15—an organizer for UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union representing HUDS—as well as dining service workers to come up with a draft of the petition. McCarthy also said he sent a “targeted email” to about 75 Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors.
“As faculty members, we recognize the indispensable role dining service workers play in maintaining Harvard as a community,” the petition reads. “We avail ourselves of the many dining options here every day, and we appreciate that HUDS workers not only serve food, but create and nourish community in ways that are absolutely invaluable to this institution.”
Of the 130 signatories, 65 are listed as being employed in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—there were 964 total faculty in FAS in the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Among the signatories  are both senior and junior faculty members, and one member of the Faculty Council—Professor Vincent Brown.
“There’s quite a diverse range of people who have signed on to this, in terms of school, in terms of discipline, and also in terms of rank,” McCarthy said, adding that he is “proud” of the “courage of junior faculty signing on and being heard at this particular moment in history.”
McCarthy said some departments have been more receptive to the strike than others.
“The humanities and some social sciences are probably more robustly represented than other departments and other disciplines,” he said. “I think we always have trouble, unfortunately, getting members of the Economics department to sign on to this, although we have a couple.”
Two economics faculty members—professor Stephen A. Marglin and professor emeritus John Womack, Jr.—signed the petition. McCarthy said this petition is a continuation of the work he, Ganz, Parker, and others were engaged in during the “living wage” campaign in the early 2000s, during which workers and students who were in what was then called the Progressive Student Labor Movement sought a wage of at least $10.25 for all Harvard employees.
Indeed, Parker said, he and Ganz have been involved in many types of campus activism for decades.
“Any time there’s a question of those who are more vulnerable needing help, it seems to both Marshall and me that we have a moral duty to act,” Parker said.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga could not be reached for comment.

Harvard and its dining workers reached a “tentative agreement” around 1:05 a.m. Tuesday morning—the closest the two parties have come to a contract settlement during months of tense negotiations.
Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers—said the accord “accomplished all of our goals.” The deal is yet to be ratified; it must first be sent to a 30-member bargaining subcommittee Tuesday, Lang added, before the full membership of dining workers in the union vote on the deal Wednesday.
Though he declined to provide specific details on the agreement, Lang said HUDS employees could return to work as early as Thursday. According to an email sent last week by College Dean for Finance and Administration Sheila C. Thimba, it will take at most two days from the official end of the strike before the University’s dining halls can resume “normal operations.”
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email that further details about the agreement would be forthcoming Tuesday morning.
Protesters greeted news of the tentative deal with cheers and jubilation outside 124 Mt. Auburn St., the Harvard office building where Monday’s negotiations took place.
“I’m feeling great about it, everything feels good,” dining services worker William H. Sawyer, who participated in the negotiation process, said at around 1:30 a.m. as he prepared to bike home. “The students and everyone behind us [have] been really inspirational… they kept us up, up, up, up and alive about this.”
“Even right now, they still here,” he added, pointing to the handful of students—all members of the Student Labor Action Movement—who remained outside the building, shouting and jumping up and down in celebration in the wee hours of the morning. “Everybody else gone home.”
In early October, HUDS workers launched an unprecedented strike—their first to take place during the academic year—calling on the University to increase wages and to maintain the current health benefits package it offers to dining hall employees. The last HUDS strike occurred more than 30 years ago.
The tentative agreement came after a day of intense picketing and rallying by both HUDS workers and student supporters. More than 500 students walked out of class—the second walkout of the strike—before marching to 124 Mt. Auburn St. for a sit-in that lasted late into the night, wrapping up around 10:30 p.m. at the urging of police officers.
By the time Harvard affiliates and union negotiators announced their tentative agreement, only a small cohort of students remained outside the building, along with a few HUDS workers. At one point during the night, students and strikers joined hands and marched in a circle, singing “We Shall Overcome.”
Abhinav Reddy, a School of Public Health student and graduate student union organizer, described the final moments of the night. Local 26’s bargaining team joined the demonstrators remaining outside, he said, and “everyone gathered back up and started chanting.”
“You could just see it on their faces before they even said anything,” Reddy said. “And everybody was like screaming and yelling, and then they said ‘we won, we got it.’”
SLAM member Grace F. Evans ’19, also present at the negotiations’ conclusion, said workers came out of the building visibly emotional before Lang announced to the assembled crowd of supporters that the union had “won.”
“It was a really emotional moment,” she said. “The workers were crying but Brian Lang was smiling, so we knew it was good news.”
Reflecting on the day’s events, Evans said she felt students had been important to HUDS workers’ success, a sentiment some workers echoed.
“It was definitely powerful that we were here,” Evans said, referring to the earlier lobby sit-in. “The negotiators looked down and they saw that.” 
The nearly three-week long strike shook Harvard’s campus, led to multiple dining hall closures, and spurred waves of student activism and nation-wide support. At the largest strike event Saturday, more than 1,000 HUDS workers and supporters marched to Cambridge City Hall.
Edward B. Childs, a dining services workers who picketed from 7 a.m Monday morning until around 1 a.m Tuesday, said he had suspected Monday’s negotiation session would be fruitful.
“Well, with the escalation we had this weekend and today, I was expecting something,” Childs said. “I knew something had to break.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­The No. 12 Harvard field hockey team’s biggest threat to winning the Ivy league this year came this past Saturday when the team traveled to New Jersey to face off with No. 10 Princeton.
The Tigers, coming off a 5-1 win against Brown the previous weekend, came into the matchup undefeated in its four games in conference play, tied with Harvard for the top spot.
Not only did the Tigers enter with momentum, but they were also entered with history on their side. Princeton had won the past 22 matchups between these two teams. Harvard hadn’t emerged victorious over the Tigers since the first term of the Bill Clinton administration.
The Crimson knew that someone needed to step up in a big way for the team to overcome such a challenge and stay atop the Ancient Eight standings.
It turns out that sophomore forward Kathleen Young was that someone.
In Harvard’s 3-2 overtime victory, Young scored twice, including the crucial winner in overtime. Her efforts helped end the Crimson’s 22-game losing streak against Princeton (9-6, 4-1 Ivy) as well as giving the team sole possession of first place in the Ivy League.
With the win, Harvard (9-4, 5-0) now has its longest win streak in program history, having posted seven consecutive victories.
“I think she is a phenomenal athlete,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “Her work-rate and speed have been a huge part of our offensive prep and our pressing, which has worked really well so far. She was able to get one goal earlier this season. It matters so much more that she did it against Princeton, who is one of our rivals.”
Senior Marissa Balleza opened the scoring for the Crimson the 13th minute. In the 27th minute, junior midfielder Ellie Cookson brought the ball into the circle and sent it towards the net.
As the ball bounced around in front of the net, Young gathered it and knocked it in for the score, her second of the season. Due to Balleza and Young’s efforts, Harvard went into the half with a 2-0 lead.
“The team was comfortable that we could compete with Princeton,” van Herwaarden said. “This team has set a goal for themselves to win the Ivy league and that’s the mission and we approach it on a game by game basis. I think we started really well and took a well deserved 2-0 lead.”
Despite the score at halftime, the Tigers rallied in the second half. Princeton senior attacker Cat Caro, the team’s leading scorer, scored twice, in the 45th and 64th minutes, to tie the game up.
With neither team able to score again in regulation, the game went into overtime.
After a long 70 minutes, during which momentum swung back and forth between them, both teams headed into overtime prepared for another grueling session. However, only 59 seconds into overtime, Young received a pass just to the right of the Tiger’s zone. Gathering the ball, she raced along the end line and tucked her shot just inside the near post for the winner.
“The team that comes back usually has the momentum in overtime,” van Herwaarden said. But we were able to get forward; and the goal setup was exactly as we discussed it. Kathleen’s phenomenal skills and speed allowed her to get past the defender and she kept herself calm and collected and was able to score the winner.”
After this weekend’s game against Princeton, the Crimson have two remaining games in Ivy league play: against Dartmouth and Columbia in the final week of the season.
Winning both of these games would seal Harvard’s first Ivy league title since 2004 and its fourth in program history. The team is glad to have Young on its side for these final games of its season.
“What we’re really hoping for is to win Ivies, especially all the senior girls because it’s their last year and they want go out strong,” Balleza said following Harvard’s win against Cornell last Saturday.
Now, because of Kathleen Young’s performance against the Tigers, that hope is still very much alive.

Flyby arrived at the Charles River donning our Crimson vests and Bean Boots under the pretense of cheering on internationally-renowned rowers. We stayed to inhale free samples, drool over cute dogs and European Olympians, and capture the perfect #Insta. Here are our takeaways from the 2016 Head of the Charles Regatta.
The Best
Free FoodHaving braved nearly three weeks of subpar menu items in the HUDS-less dining halls, this was a definite draw. After multiple laps up and down the River, we scored quite a variety of snacks. Our inner kleptomaniac emerged at the sight of open containers of bagged Popcorner chips and kettle corn, which were among the aggressively promo-ed freebies. We shamelessly went back for thirds (okay... fourths) of Ghirardelli chocolates, sriracha chicken samplers, and BBQ ribs to fill us up for breakfast and lunch. All these morsels were washed down by free Bigelow tea and “Celsius” negative-calorie energy drinks, which claims to burn fat for you by raising your heart rate (read: have mini heart attacks to lose weight!). We ended the day by taking several 12-pack boxes of Chobani hummus dips and more free chips (to dip in our many dips, of course), which are now sitting in our dorm rooms untouched. At least we're prepared for another 3 weeks of only getting $50 in oh-so-flexible Crimson Cash.
DogsHead of the Charles should be renamed Puppy Heaven. Never in our college careers have we seen so many dogs in one place, especially with elderly owners amiable enough to let us cuddle and photograph them. We’re talking dogs with sweaters, people. All the cute canine sightings definitely made the trek to the river worthwhile, despite reminding us of the dearth of unconditional affection in our daily lives.
Athlete Eye CandyImagine: tall, lanky studs scattered for miles. Forget the ones actually rowing in the water—because we’re not hardcore binocular-wearing fanatics, we could barely see their faces. Instead, we strolled along the banks to ogle the athletes up close and hang on their every enchanting word about erg machines. Bonus points for accents. Note, the aloof species of crew boy is much less attainable than that of canines, and is not to be approached.
The WorstOur tummies full, our dog quota maxed out, our boy fantasies realized—HOCR seemed too good to be true. There were, however, a few drawbacks.
Darties (or Lack Thereof) Maybe we’re not cool enough, but these were virtually non-existent. Granted, Saturday’s rainy weather was not ideal for outdoor gatherings, but we expected at least a smattering of kickbacks on Sunday. We were disappointed to find the Head of the Charles is more of a classy, family affair than cause for inebriated undergraduate festivities.
Overpriced MerchandiseIf you wanted to commemorate your HOCR experience, good luck doing so without throwing down some cash. Sponsors like Brooks Brothers, which even came up with a posh geotag for the event, were definitely catering towards a clientele other than broke college students.
TouristThe journey down JFK street was near impossible, as everyone walks significantly slower than the average go-getter Harvard student. Just because we knew what we were getting into as spectators from around the world descended on Cambridge for the weekend doesn’t mean we don’t get to complain.
