After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Economics 10 lecture last Wednesday, Professor Andrei Shleifer ’82 waxed poetic about the macroeconomic implications of tuna fish sandwiches. According to Professor Shleifer, Harvard is analogous to the U.S. government, and Harvard University Dining Services, which runs the Science Center Greenhouse Cafe, is analogous to a government agency. Since tuna fish sandwiches at the Business School, where food services are contracted out, are cheaper and better than those at the Science  Center, the dining hall workers’ union is directly responsible for rising tuition costs. Thus, both universities and government should privatize or contract out as many public services as possible.
If that logic seems far-fetched, it is interesting to note that it breaks down every step of the way. To start, the Science Center sandwiches are in fact not prepared by HUDS workers, but rather are bought from an outside, private company. At the same time, the tastier and cheaper business school sandwiches are prepared by workers who belong to Unite Here Local 26, the union that represents all of Harvard’s food service workers. In fact, the business school workers earn the same wages and have better benefits than their Science Center counterparts. Furthermore, contrary to Professor Shleifer’s claims, Harvard’s food service workers have consistently advocated for students’ best interests. For instance, in response to student demands, the union secured healthier, more sustainable, and tastier food in the dining halls during its contract negotiations with HUDS management. Dining hall workers are often also the first to notice students’ physical, mental, and emotional health problems, including eating disorders, and to take action to care for and protect the students. As committed members of Harvard’s community, the workers are dedicated to the well-being of students and faculty in a way that contracted-out workers are far less likely to be.
What’s more, Professor Shleifer did not provide evidence that unionization or rising wages have caused tuition increases. College tuition is rising rapidly (far outpacing inflation) at a wide variety of public and private institutions around the country. The pervasiveness of this trend indicates that it is not rising input costs, but rather increasing application numbers, higher willingness to pay, and expectations of future benefits that are driving tuition increases. In fact, even though Tufts’ dining hall workers receive lower wages than Harvard’s workers do, Tufts students pay more for their meals/board (as well as tuition) than Harvard students do.  It is important to remember that Harvard students are luckier than most, for the university’s financial aid makes our education more affordable than ever; over the past five years, Harvard has increased financial aid by over 70 percent. It is clear that, especially at a school with a $32 billion endowment, decent wages and affordability can and do go hand in hand.
Of all people, Professor Shleifer should know that contracting out and privatization do not always work as advertised. In the early 1990s, as head of Harvard’s Russia Project, he advised the Russian government on the privatization of state-owned properties, advocating for “shock therapy,” a particular form of rapid market liberalization. During this process, gross domestic product and living standards fell significantly while unemployment, crime, and homelessness increased. Life expectancy in particular declined by an unprecedented 4 years. According to a 2009 study published in The Lancet, many of the 3.4 million premature deaths could be attributed to the negative effects of shock therapy. At the same time, a handful of individuals closely to the Yeltsin regime became billionaires virtually overnight.
Professor Sheifer also benefitted, for his wife's hedge fund participated in the privatization deals. This conflict of interest led to a Department of Justice investigation and a lawsuit against Shleifer and his associates, which Harvard eventually settled for $26.5 million, or $4,000 per undergrad.
We don’t need to go as far as Russia to witness the limits of privatization. In the United   States, private, for-profit schools significantly underperform compared to their public counterparts, while profit-maximizing private prisons frequently lobby to put more people in jail for longer periods of time. Since the interests of management do not always line up with those of workers, consumers, students, or the general public, unions often play an indispensable role in advocating on behalf of these groups.
In his lecture, Professor Shleifer claimed, “I am not trying to make any value judgments. That’s not what we do in economics.” Yet, in the very same lecture, when a student asked whether Harvard, as a nonprofit, might have a moral responsibility to treat its workers fairly rather than exploiting them for financial gain, Professor Shleifer responded that Harvard had very little, if any, obligation to its workers at all. This stands in stark contrast to the utmost care Shleifer himself has received from Harvard University, in the form of the $26.5 million settlement paid on his behalf. The union members take their responsibility to care for every student, faculty member, and worker on campus seriously. Rather than pitting students against workers, we should all work together to further our community’s well-being and our university’s ideals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent, widely circulated feature in Rolling Stone has shed light on hazing and fraternity culture at Dartmouth College. Andrew Lohse, a Dartmouth student currently on leave and former member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, has made public some of the most egregious abuses that he has witnessed and engaged in as a fraternity brother, including coercing pledgers into entering vats of vomit and other bodily fluids, drinking at extremely dangerous levels, and eating omelets made of eggs and vomit, known as “vomlets.” Dartmouth’s hazing culture, as expounded by Rolling Stone and other sources, is unequivocally horrific. But particularly troubling about the controversy is that Dartmouth administrators have failed to adequately address hazing and, indeed, may even have been complicit in the abuses perpetrated at fraternities.
Regardless of the truthfulness of Andrew Lohse’s specific allegations, it is undeniable that his testimony has helped bring Dartmouth’s problematic culture of hazing into the spotlight. Some have alleged that Lohse, who has been ostracized by SAE and much of Dartmouth’s undergraduate population, may have intentionally exaggerated or fabricated incidents of hazing in order to legitimize his position and bolster his public image. While there is certainly reason to doubt the accuracy of Lohse’s story, the hazing culture that he has exposed has been well-documented and protested by other students at Dartmouth.
There are significant amounts of objective evidence that verify Lohse’s accusations. In one particularly harrowing example, Rolling Stone reports, Hanover police planned to intervene at SAE’s “Hell Night,” the final night of pledge season, after Lohse tipped of Dartmouth overseers. Before they could do so, however, Dartmouth administrators corresponded with the president of SAE to ensure that the fraternity’s public activities on Hell Night would not constitute hazing. The police operation was ultimately unsuccessful.
In this incident, it appears that the Dartmouth administration did not just remain willfully ignorant of hazing at SAE, but, in fact, went out of its way to avoid publicly penalizing the fraternity for violating anti-hazing policies. The reasons behind this compliance are not difficult to imagine: No university wants to become a subject of national scrutiny for its flagrant violation of anti-hazing laws. Some have suggested, significantly, that Dartmouth fraternities may be effectively immune from university oversight because wealthy alumni that hold leverage in university affairs are interested in preserving the hazing culture that they experienced and sustained in college. Such an arrangement, if truthful, is unacceptable. Dartmouth College should not be in the business of allowing abuses to go unpunished, regardless of the economic influence of a group that wishes to sustain them.
Unfortunately, hazing is not just endemic to Dartmouth. According to one estimate, over half of college students in the U.S. involved in extracurricular organizations have experienced hazing. While Harvard College is lucky to not have a strong culture of hazing and an administration that has taken a strong stance against the practice, hazing nonetheless occurs at social organizations on our campus. Hazing is particularly difficult to identify and address because there are powerful psychological phenomena that ensure its survival. According to one study, for example, members of organizations are more likely to identify strongly with their peers and place great value on their positions within groups if their initiations included violence or other psychologically taxing activities. Hazing can also create a culture of fear that discourages victims from speaking out about the abuses that they experienced. Indeed, an astonishing 95 percent of students who knowingly experienced hazing did not report the activities to university administrators.
For these reasons, it is important that we do not perceive students who haze or are complicit in hazing as monsters. Powerful psychological tactic that it is, hazing has persisted not because those who sustain it are violent sociopaths, but because of the misguided notion that it is an appropriate way to build camaraderie. If victims and enablers of hazing are empowered to speak out against a system in which they were once complicit without fear of harsh judgment, we may finally begin to combat the deeply entrenched but enormously damaging phenomenon of hazing.

Crafting a successful simile is an immensely satisfying experience. It is one of the real pleasures of language—marrying together likeness while also scintillating with the risk of difference. To hazard one myself, it is one of the preeminent gambles we can take with words, because it requires daring, a dash of bravado, and a sympathetic ear. One might think that Erik Fehrnstrom, a senior advisor to Mitt Romney’s Presidential campaign, won the jackpot when he compared his boss’s transition to the upcoming general election campaign to a certain toy: “Everything changes. It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.” Fehrnstrom’s delivery is flawless; the statement of a general truth about universal change, the leap into simile, with the hedging qualification “almost” (poets are not yet, alas, the legislators of the world), and then the glossing of that simile, just in case our memories of Etch A Sketches are appropriately muddled. It is, without a doubt, the Simile of the Year. But when then was it greeted with more consternation than approbation by Team Romney?
Explicating a simile is almost as bad as explaining a joke, as both suffer rather than thrive under the microscope. But the image of the Etch A Sketch, with its interlocking resonances of writing and erasure, composition and blankness, is a plastic and aluminum (no, not sand) aperture into the consistently bedeviling problem of constancy in our politics. We demand unwavering conviction, but reality requires flexibility. Principles and pragmatism dance uneasily, with the former aspiring to the flexibility of the latter, and the second striving for the rectitude of the first.
As with so much else about our country, Ralph Waldo Emerson articulated a truth about us early on; “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” This certainly seems to be true in our politics, although Emerson most likely did not foresee the tribulations of his fellow Massachusite John F. Kerry, who was crucified on a windsurfing board and blown adrift by the winds of pro and con votes on the very same issues. But Lyndon B. Johnson, in his persistence in pursuing the war in Vietnam, would have done well to recall Emerson’s advice, and many of us would have liked to etch our own actions with erasable ink, turning the dial to obscure immature opinions, poorly constructed arguments, and intemperate ripostes.
Certainly, no one would like to more than Mitt Romney. A conservative persona punctured by such lacunae in orthodoxy as pro-choice positions and universal healthcare is especially vulnerable to the awkward edges of a palimpsestic personal history. So far, he has avoided the dogmatic bonfires of so many primary Savanarolas. But shape-shifting has its prices, especially if Obama, like Hercules, can get ahold of this ideological Proteus.
But turn the knob on your mental Etch A Sketch and return to our original contention that every simile is a risk, an essaying of the delicate balance between likeness and difference. The beauty of the Etch A Sketch is that it allows for risks; impermanence can be midwife to invention. Static sincerity tends to be imaginatively poor and stylistically stunted. People are interesting because they change, and notice themselves changing, and chart the courses of these micro-evolutions. Oftentimes, the call for pragmatism and compromise in politics is indicative of a kind of flabby impulse toward moderation, a lazy splitting of the difference. Romney’s late career reinvention strains all manner of credulity, as one’s political convictions often undergo renovations earlier in life. But still, we should be equally skeptical at claims to steadfastness.
The best kinds of leaders consistently admit their own inconsistency and remain certain about ends, even as they experiment with means. The Etch A Sketch, invented in 1960, was the perfect medium for a decade that erased so much of what came before and re-jumbled a whole host of relations, a decade where sex and family and politics all became breathtakingly and thrillingly erasable. Our age is still thinking about new ways to order all of the writing we do, all of the record we generate. As we grow into a world we have entirely inscribed, how we erase will become a question every bit as urgent as how we write.

It’s that time of year—across campus, students are checking email and voicemail messages in anticipation of what seems like the golden ticket to success: a chance to commit three months of summer to a low- or unpaid desk job. As we send out cover letters and set up interviews, there’s a low rumble of anxiety: “Hire me! Even for free!”
As many as three-quarters of college students undertake internships before they graduate. As Ross Perlin documents in Intern Nation (recently released in paperback), many of these internships are unpaid, and many are illegal. Interns have no access to benefits and protections. In many cases, they don’t even gain any skills, not to mention any advancement in their career paths.
Unpaid internships are a feminist problem as well as a labor one. Women make up the bulk of unpaid interns: According to one study, as many as 77 percent of unpaid interns nationwide may be female (with some survey bias). The industries women often go into, such as media, fashion, or the arts, tend to rely on freelancers, temps, and other forms of “precarious” and poorly compensated labor, Perlin told me in a phone interview. With unpaid internships, pay disparities between men and women begin before we even graduate from college. Further, according to Phil Gardner of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute, companies sometimes offer two tiers of internships—paid ones to students in male-dominated fields like engineering and unpaid ones to students working in female-heavy fields like human resources. Unpaid interns, in a legal limbo between paid employees and full-time students, are often not even covered by standard workplace protections. In cases of sexual harassment, workplace regulations may simply not apply. As recently as 2008, an intern’s sexual harassment claim was dismissed because Washington  D.C.’s anti-discrimination law did not include unpaid interns in its definition of employee.
The disposable nature of the unpaid intern’s position affects the way we view our own worth. Perlin points out in his book that students do not readily think of themselves as workers, even when they are, in fact, logging in hours of paid or unpaid labor. They are likely to justify any experience as an “educational” one—although that experience may be as menial as entering data into a spreadsheet without compensation.
The students I talked with did find that they had acquired skills by working over the summer. One woman told me that her internship had informed the content of her thesis; another said that it helped eliminate arts management as a possible career path. But they acknowledged at the same time seeing no option but to work unpaid, even as they recognized having been overworked considering their lack of compensation. “The thing about theater is you need an unpaid internship to get into [the profession],” said one student who worked as a marketing intern for a theater company in New York. “The people that I want to work for really can’t afford to compensate their interns like private companies can,” said one student who had spent three consecutive summers working unpaid (with a school stipend) in a variety of policy or law positions.
It is obviously not an intern’s responsibility to ensure that the work conditions he or she enters are fair ones. This onus falls on employers, regulators, and schools, which should more clearly inform students of their rights as interns and take a more discerning eye to the postings they offer every year.
But we owe it to ourselves to learn and recognize our rights in every environment we enter, even “educational” and “beneficial” ones. If your internship immediately benefits your employer and does not train you, it may be illegal. Your employer cannot use you as a substitute for regular employees, nor should he or she use it as a “trial period” for future employment. More information can be found on the U.S. Department of Labor website—but be aware that at least one court has rejected these criteria.
This is especially important considering the emphasis on compliance and flexibility in a job market that has become more and more precarious. Unpaid internships don’t just introduce you to an office environment; they teach you to be thankful for whatever work opportunities you may have, even if these opportunities are unfruitful and unfulfilling, as others have noted. It’s similar to what feminist and lecturer in philosophy Nina Power has termed “the feminization of labor:” In an uncertain office environment, we’re all expected to be demure, enthusiastic and flexible—the characteristics of a good secretary.
Work is not good will in exchange for good conscience. Our time and our energy have value. We deserve something more than to work unpaid for no gain—as students, as workers, and as people.

Over 170 teams submitted applications for the President’s Challenge, a university-wide competition that encourages students to develop entrepreneurial solutions to the world’s social problems.
The Challenge, sponsored by University President Drew G. Faust and supported by the i-Lab, will award ten finalist groups with $5,000 each to develop solutions to five global issues—clean air, clean water, education, global health, and personal health.
Due to the surprising number of applications, the results will be announced April 9, instead of April 2 as originally planned.
The President’s Challenge provides the finalist groups with the resources necessary to actualize their proposals, with up to four of the ten winning groups eventually allotted portions of a $100,000 grand prize.
This new model of education – in which ideas and action projects of great relevance and significance to the world are combined- has had a dramatic effect on students and the roles and responsibilities they take on in the world, said Gordon M. Bloom ’82, professor of Sociology 159: “Social Entrepreneurship & Global Innovation.”
“That over 170 teams participated in Harvard’s event shows that there are a lot of students here excited about making a tremendous impact on the world,” said Aaron N. Cheng ’15.
Cheng’s group worked on a project that could address global health, focusing on sanitation problems in slums.
Consistent with the i-Lab’s mission to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation across the University, the Challenge hosted mixers throughout February and March to help the students develop their ideas.
“The mixers held at the i-Lab helped tremendously,” said Cheng. “It was amazing to be able to talk to students with different fields of expertise and hear their thoughts on our idea.”
Emily M. Kraemer ’15 said that she thinks the Challenge has helped Harvard students feel more connected, especially to the broader Harvard community. Her group, formed after mixers in the i-Lab, consists of students from the College, Graduate School of Design, and Divinity School.
Some groups, however, formed before the competition was announced and decided to apply in the hopes of receiving the funding necessary to realize their goal.
“You have to put a lot of effort into it,” said  Rahim A. Mawji ’15. “They ask for so many things, and if you don’t have a contextual background or framework to guide you in the process, then it’d be very difficult to get through the process.”
Mawji’s group, which hopes to increase literacy and create a stronger book culture in parts of Africa with e-readers, had already prepared more than half of their proposal before hearing about the competition.
Still, difficulties with the competition process were not enough to deter applicants. The possibility of becoming finalists and earning recognition for their projects was enough to keep students involved.
“I think this is winning the hearts and minds of students and faculty across campus,” said Bloom. “Change at Harvard can be slow, but this is an important and I believe inevitable direction.”

Individuals with mutations in specific genes have a high risk of autism, according to scientists working independently at Harvard, Yale, and the University of Washington in Seattle.
The scientists said they have already identified several genes that lead to an increased likelihood of autism. But there is a possibility that several hundred genes are involved in autism, said Mark J. Daly, an associate professor of medicine the senior writer of the Harvard paper.
“We’re moving away from the single gene Mendelian idea of disorders or the idea that only a few genes cause the effect,” Daly said. “There are many genes in the biological pathways.”
This discovery will allow a better treatment for autism to be developed that targets the mutated genes, according to Daly.
“It’s not good for a predictive model but can help us develop a hard biological model of autism and eventually develop a therapeutic treatment,” Daly said.
The scientists expect to find 25 or more genes by the end of year, said Stephan J. Sanders, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale and lead author of the Yale paper. Although the genes do not allow for diagnosis, it may eventually be possible once they have achieved a comprehensive knowledge of the genes that cause autism, he added. Even more powerful, their findings might lead to a treatment.
“The study of genes helps us understand what autism is at a fundamental level,” Sanders said. “This understanding will help us develop a treatment. Right now we don’t know what autism is, except that it is genetic.”
The scientists at Harvard, Yale, and University of Washington worked independently, only coordinating at the end of their studies when the papers were being submitted for publication, according to Sanders.
The three teams each had papers published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.
Sanders and the team at Yale studied 238 families, who each had only one child diagnosed with autism. This process was essential so mutations in specific genes could be found, which would indicate the gene’s link to autism. Sanders said that by the end of the year, the Yale research team plans to have studied 2600 families.
“We see genes as part of a jigsaw puzzle; find enough of them and you can see what the disease is,” Sanders said.

In response to last month’s killing of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, students across the University have begun photo campaigns to protest racial profiling.
About 15 residents of Eliot House have photographed themselves wearing hooded sweatshirts alongside questions like, “Is this a ‘black’ problem?” The questions are accompanied by a hashtag that says “#hoodiesup,” referring to the popular Twitter topic commemorating Martin’s death.
Across the river, Harvard Medical School students posed together wearing lab coats and hooded sweatshirts in front of the Longwood campus with the words, “Do I look suspicious?” printed above them.
Martin was shot and killed in February while walking home through a gated community in Sanford, Fla. by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who claimed that he acted out of self-defense. In a 911 call, Zimmerman told authorities that the unarmed teenager appeared to be suspicious.
Though Zimmerman has not been formally charged with any crimes, the shooting has renewed nationwide debates about racial profiling and discrimination.
After attending the rally to raise local awareness about Martin’s death in Harvard Square last month, Nyamagaga Gondwe ’13 said that she was inspired to organize a campaign similar to The Million Hoodies Project in Eliot House. According to their Facebook profile, The Million Hoodies Project asks participants to upload photos of themselves and others wearing hooded sweatshirts in order to “vent, express outrage and support one another in response to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.”
“Imagery is such a poignant and fast way to have a person empathize with what you’re trying to tell them,” Gondwe said. “A picture gives a person who sees it the opportunity to grapple with the situation themselves.”
Gondwe sent an email to other students and tutors in the House explaining why she was interested in The Million Hoodies Project and asking for support.
Pauline Mutumwinka ’12, said the email was “extremely moving” and that it made a compelling case for why, as a black person, she needed to participate.
Mutumwinka said that she hopes the project gets people to think more critically about the problem of racial profiling.
“It’s not something that’s just going to go away,” she said.
The project was particularly meaningful for Eliot House race relations tutor Carl L. Miller. Miller said that he frequently wears hoodies and, as a black man with younger siblings, the Martin shooting really hit home.
“I hope [the project] levels the playing field in terms of how ridiculous it is that wearing a hoodie and happening to be African-American can be thought of as a cause for being followed and assaulted,” Miller said.
Medical School student F. Garrett Conyers organized a similar campaign with his peers to show support for Martin’s family and others who have lost loved ones as a result of racially-motivated violence.
“We realize that taking a picture can’t have this genuine lasting impact on an issue, but to think that if we can even slightly change someone’s worldview makes a difference,” Conyers said.

As several of Harvard’s regional centers continue to cope with a 50 percent reduction in federal support, they must also suffer sustained cuts in financial assistance from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, according to various administrators.
In the past, FAS’ regular operating budget has covered the costs of a number of programs provided by regional research centers—including language training and graduate student fellowships. But after the financial crisis, these monies were diverted to other academic priorities within FAS, forcing centers to trim their budgets and reach into their endowments.
“In the three fiscal years since the crisis hit, CES [the Center for European Studies]—like other area centers—has redirected part of its income to the FAS to help the process of closing the FAS budget gap,” Director of CES David G. Blackbourn wrote in an email.
Centers reduced their budgets by at least 10 to 15 percent for Fiscal Year 2010, as requested by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith in Dec. 2008. These cuts helped FAS recover from the $225 million two-year deficit it suffered following the 2008 economic meltdown.
At the peak of the crisis, for example, the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute for Japanese Studies paid approximately 30 percent of its annual budget to FAS administration, according to Andrew D. Gordon, director of the Reischauer Institute.
According to Gordon, continued redirection of money from the regional centers to FAS could potentially harm Harvard's world-class reputation in international studies. But “to the extent that this was a short-term response in a crisis, we all understood the need,” Gordon wrote in an email.
FAS is poised to balance the budget by the end of this academic year. But in a process called “FAS debt relief,” the centers’ annual contributions to FAS are now permanent, according to Susan M. Kahn, associate director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
The financial restraints imposed by the redirection of money from centers to core FAS operations have been exacerbated in four of Harvard’s regional centers, which saw their sources of federal funding reduced by nearly 50 percent in the beginning of Fiscal Year 2012.
Reduced funding to centers from both FAS and federal sources has impeded the launch of new programming, such as international mini-courses sponsored by the Reischauer Institute during Winter Break, Gordon said. And the Center for Middle Eastern Studies has had to eliminate its academic journal, Kahn said.
The decision to redirect funds from the budgets of the Harvard’s regional centers was part of a broader strategy by Smith to “eliminate the structural budget deficit and [put] the FAS on the path to sustainable excellence,” according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
“It is important that we continue a budgeting approach that focuses first on academic priorities, today and in the years to come,” Neal wrote in an email statement.

As a part of the internationally-recognized Free Speech Week, the Harvard Libertarian Forum has built and maintained a free speech wall in front of the Science Center for this week.
Made of white paper taped onto a chain link fence, the wall features comments written by passers-by. The short messages include reflections on religion, academics, social life at Harvard, gender, and sexuality, as well as the occasional obscenity.
The wall is a statement against Harvard’s speech policies, “which state that you’re basically not allowed to say racist, sexist, classist, any other kinds of discriminatory things,” according to HLF member Corinne H. Curcie ’15, who organized the display. This system “is really not conducive to this type of learning environment,” she added.
Commenters even jested about the traditional limits of free speech. For example, one person wrote “Fire!!! (in a crowded theater).”
Curcie said that traditional censorship is not needed, because racist or libelous comments can be negated by further speech. Forcing people who make derogatory remarks to defend their opinions will expose the flaws of their beliefs, she added.
Indeed, near a comment implying a conspiracy theory about September 11, someone wrote, “Conspiracy theory = Not true.”
“That’s the epitome of what we’re trying to demonstrate,” she said. “You don’t need to cross things out. You need to reply to things.”
HLF Vice President Dana L. Modzelewski ’13 said that “one of the greatest ways that we’re controlled in our thoughts is how we’re allowed to express them.” The purpose of the wall, she added, is to return liberties to members of the community.
The wall was also supported by Students for Liberty, an international non-profit student organization that began hosting annual free speech weeks.
Karina Zannat, northeast regional director for SFL, said HFL’s effort is in line with SFL’s broader goals of advising and supporting student libertarian organizations. Zannat met Curcie at Harvard last fall and worked with her to organize this event.
The wall has been up since Monday, from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. each day, and will be removed Friday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many students expressed dismay in response to 7-Eleven’s anticipated departure from Harvard Square this fall, when they will make way for a new branch of the Boston burger restaurant, Tasty Burger.
The 7-Eleven has been a staple of Harvard Square since 1998, when it first opened at the corner of JFK and Mount Auburn Streets. Since then, the minimart has provided late night snacks and beverages to over a decade of Harvard students.
“I have a sentimental attachment,” Conrad I. Shock ’15 said, who first bought food at 7-Eleven during his pre-orientation weekend.
“That’s where I get my cheap, disgusting coffee when I’m writing a paper,” Brian K. Mwarania ’15 said. He listed cheap soda, mixers, and chips “with that disgusting artificial cheese” as essential foods he would miss from 7-Eleven.
Students also mentioned the convenience store’s trademark slurpees and one-dollar donuts.
“Their slurpees will definitely be missed,” Eric A Zuckerman ’15 said.
But several students said they were apathetic at the impending departure of 7-Eleven. With CVS only a few blocks away, many said that they would continue to use CVS as their convenience store of choice.
Only one student interviewed for this article said she was happy to see 7-Eleven leave the Square.
“I’m not gong to miss it,” Mandi Nyambi ’15 said. “Their food is really gross.”
Nyambi said she is excited for the arrival of Tasty Burger, which she considers a healthier and better tasting choice. In particular, she said she hopes that the restaurant would shorten lines in other burger restaurants in the Square.
“It’s cool that we have so many options,” Nyambi said.
However, some students remain skeptical.
“Do we really need another burger place in Harvard Square?” said Mwarania, who listed burger restaurants, such as Flat Patties, Bartley’s and b.good, as comparable alternatives. Indeed, Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14 said that he would prefer a restaurant that served new or unique food in Harvard Square, as opposed to another burger or burrito restaurant.
“Eww, I hate that chain. It’s all over Boston,” he said. “We need more vegetarian places!”
“The general sentiment is boo, boo, boo,” Mwarania added.
“Competition is always good, but I’d prefer a 7-Eleven,” Zuckerman said.

Harvard professors discussed the challenges of maximizing returns on the University’s investments while simultaneously integrating environmental, social, and governance considerations at a panel hosted by the Undergraduate Council yesterday.
Panelists, including Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and founder of Zevin Asset Management, Robert Zevin, spoke on the tension between long-term returns on investments and social responsibility.
“There is a potential problem in assuming that what is good for Harvard is what is good for the whole world,” Khurana said.
Speakers said that while the Harvard Management Company, which oversees Harvard’s endowment, aims to consider these environmental, social, and governance factors across all asset classes, it is still under the University’s mandate to ensure that investments are sustainable over a long period of time.
“We are also responsible for the following generations,” said Robert Kaplan, acting president and chief executive officer of the Harvard Management Company from 2007 to 2008. “Through Harvard’s endowment, we want to make sure that future students who need financial aid and future professors who need support for ground-breaking research  also have the capacity to continue making a difference.”
Delara Z. Alameddine ’14, who spearheaded the event as a UC Dunster House representative, said that the purpose of the event was to bring an open forum of discussion where students could voice their concerns, particularly current seniors who are passionate about the issue.
In response to questions about the Fair Harvard Fund, which aims to give alumni the chance to specify how they want their donations spent, Kaplan said that the decision to integrate the fund into the Harvard Management Company’s portfolio was out of their hands.
“Unfortunately, this is not a decision for the Harvard Management Company, but a decision for the University,” said Kaplan. “But if they choose to accept it, we will figure out a way to do it and do it successfully.”
Evelyn D. Chow ’12, a member of the coalition Responsible Investment at Harvard said she understood that some of the speakers were constrained by the positions they held, but felt that some questions were not fully answered.
“[The speakers] did not address my question about moving beyond a risk management framework towards the integration of environmental, social, and governance factors,” said Chow. “We need a concrete system through which the Harvard Management Company will actually display that they are taking these factors into consideration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congressional candidate Joseph P. Kennedy III ventured out of the Fourth Congressional District Tuesday night to make a campaign stop of sorts at Winthrop House, where he was the inaugural speaker in the Perini-Woods Memorial Speaker Series. His address, part campaign stump speech, part motivational charge, called on young people to become politically engaged and help turn the country around.
“You are an essential part of this conversation. Not only because of the contributions each of you can make to a campaign, but also because the choices that politicians are making now down in Washington will have a dramatic impact on your generation, my generation, our generation,” the 31-year-old Kennedy said.
Youth was the subject of much of his speech and much of Kennedy’s still-unfolding Congressional campaign to fill the seat vacated by long-time Representative Barney Frank ’61-’62.
The Perini-Woods Memorial Speaker Series was announced in March to commemorate two members of the class of 1986 who died shortly after graduation.
According to Winthrop House Master Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., the decision to invite Kennedy as the inaugural speaker was not accidental. Not only a rising political candidate, Kennedy was also a logical choice because of his family’s historic tie to the house.
Indeed, any political appearance by a Kennedy at Harvard is liable to cast a glance back at history. The speech at Winthrop on Tuesday was in part a coming home for Kennedy, whose grandfather Robert F. Kennedy ’48 and great-uncle John F. Kennedy ’40 were both Winthrop House residents. As part of his visit, Kennedy toured the former president’s suite in Winthrop and knocked on the door of his grandfather’s room across the hall.
Perhaps appropriately, Kennedy’s speech leaned heavily on his family’s intellectual legacy. Referring to a speech his grandfather delivered in South Africa in 1965, Kennedy called for youth to reinvigorate the political arena.
“We are not too young, too naïve, or too inexperienced to demand change,” Kennedy said. “We are exactly the ones to drive it.”
“There’s an old rule of thumb in politics that 90 percent of all 90 year-olds vote and 25 percent of all 25 year-olds vote. In the 2008 election, you helped change that,” Kennedy added. “But now it’s up to you again to help decide if that was the exception or the rule.”
Kennedy also spent a good portion of the speech discussing his own experience and background, including his work in the Peace Corps, at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, and as an assistant district attorney—points that have, to those following his candidacy, become increasingly familiar. Within these descriptions, the recent Harvard Law School grad highlighted the similarities that he shares with many Harvard students and alumni.
Kennedy used his experiences in pubic service as a springboard to talk about his current campaign, sharing stories from the trail and some of his own political views.
Kennedy is considered the frontrunner to replace Frank in the Fourth District in November’s election. In the most recent poll, Kennedy held a nearly 2-to-1 lead over his foremost Republican opponent, Sean Bielat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A total of five students turned out to discuss the College’s new alcohol policy at a series of three meetings this week.
According to Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, three undergraduates came out to a meeting in Pfhorzheimer House on Monday, while two students showed up to a meeting in Boylston Hall on Wednesday. A third and final meeting in Eliot House on Thursday evening drew no students at all.
The College invited undergraduates to this week’s meetings in a March 30 email to the student body announcing its new, largely unchanged regulations for on-campus drinking, which will go into effect next fall.
Although Nelson said she was unsure why so few undergraduates had attended the meetings, she said she thought the students who did show up were “generally happy with the process and outcome.”
The College had originally intended to consider making further changes to the policy based on the feedback they received from students at the meetings.
But Nelson said that due to the positive response of those few undergraduates who did attend, the policy will likely be presented in its current form to the faculty next fall to be approved as an addition to the student handbook.
Although this draft of the policy will see no further changes based on student input, Nelson defended the College’s cumulative efforts to listen to undergraduate voices, saying she thought “students will agree that this was an inclusive process.”
The meetings were part of a year-long effort by the College to solicit student feedback about Harvard’s drinking culture. As the alcohol policy committee—composed of students and administrators—drafted a new policy over the past year, the College hosted seven meetings for students last fall. When these meetings saw low turnout, the College launched an online survey for students in February.
Nelson, who co-chaired the alcohol policy committee with Cabot Co-House Master Rakesh Khurana, said she was not disappointed by the low turnout at the meetings.
“As House Master Khurana has said, it’s more important that you have a good process, that students have an opportunity to have a voice,” Nelson said.
Eliot House Committee Co-Chair Wesley W. Mann attributed the lack of turnout at Thursday night’s 8:30 p.m. meeting to a busy night in Eliot House. A House Stein Club and an intramural soccer game were both scheduled for 9 p.m.
Mann also noted that the event was not “heavily, heavily publicized”—it was not, for instance, advertised over the Eliot House email list.
“The process has been very long,” Mann said. “People definitely gave their input and their opinions—I don’t think that they really need to say the same thing over again.”
Eliot Co-House Master Gail O’Keefe said that some of the students she spoke with had “heard about [the meetings], but they were politely declining” to attend.
Eliot resident Dipona K. Bandy ’14, who did not know about the meeting before it happened, said she didn’t think the low turnout indicated a lack of interest.
“I don’t think people are disinterested in the issue,” Bandy said. “I’ve heard a lot of people are frustrated with the new policies.”

Two entomologists discussed the nuances of communication and temperature regulation in honey bees at a presentation hosted this past Tuesday by the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
The presentation, titled “Learning from Insects: How Our World is Shaped by Bees, Ants and Other Social Insects,” was given to commemorate the recent publication of “A World of Insects: A Harvard University Press Reader,” a compendium of excerpts from some of the most well-known entomology books ever published by Harvard University Press.
Professor Naomi Pierce, Curator of Lepidoptera at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, moderated the event, telling the crowd of over 200 people packed into the Geology Lecture Hall that much of entomology’s value lies in detailed field work.
“What you find here are not just landmark stories describing animal behavior[...]what is clearly evident in this book is a rich collection of natural history, something not taught as much at Harvard in this genomic age,” Pierce said.
Pierce introduced the evening’s speakers, Cornell University neurobiology and behavior professor Thomas Seeley and University of Vermont biology professor Bernd Heinrich.
Heinrich, a dark horse winner of the Boston Marathon in 1980, is known for his studies of ravens, where he drives a truck with carrion in the trunk in order to study the communication methods of the ravens that follow him.
Seeley first discussed the behaviors of bees relating to honey production and hive organization.
He emphasized the view of bee colonies operating “like a factory” whose input is nectar and whose output is honey.“Different individuals [do] different jobs in the overall process,” said Seeley. “There is a division of labor.”
Seeley also explained that bees have a surprisingly complex system of communication using body movements (“dances” and “signals”).
The more famous “waggle” dance and shaking signal are used to signal to bees in the hive that more foragers are needed in the field.
Seeley closed his part of the presentation by emphasizing the need to appreciate the complexity of the bee hive community, saying “I hope that the next time you smoozle some honey onto an English muffin or some toast you’ll give a little thought to the bees and their shaking and waggling.”
Heinrich took to the podium next, discussing mechanisms of body temperature regulation in honey bees. He explained that regulation of body temperature is correlated to the honey-making process, where bees will maintain higher temperatures while airborne in spite of cold air temperatures.
Heinrich explained that bees have a shiver mechanism for added warmth, and also have to regulate the temperature of their abdomens because the hollow cavities inside them are used for storage of nectar on the return trip to the hive, the so-called “honey stomach.”
Heinrich then addressed the quintessential feature of the honey bee: the buzz.
The bee’s buzzing sound is caused by body vibrations the bee produces to stay warm.
Heinrich explained that this vibration mechanism “locks the wings in like a clutch,” allowing them to shiver while their wings stay in place.
In the question and answer session at the end of the presentation, Winnie Nauda, a nine-year-old in attendance with her mother, raised her hand and asked a question that had not been addressed up until that point: “How do the bees make the honey?”
Seeley and Heinrich answered Nauda’s question, explaining that the bees take the nectar and concentrate it’s the sugar dissolved in it, producing the sweet and thick honey they are so well known for.

History of Science Lecturer Christopher J. Phillips researches the cultural authority of mathematics in modern America. Last semester, he co-curated an exhibition called “Cold War in the Classroom: The Material Culture of Mid-Century Science Education” in Harvard’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. Currently, he is teaching a class called “From Lab Rats to Venture Capitalists: The Making of a Scientist.”
The Harvard Crimson: Did you ever consider becoming a scientist?
Phillips: When I first started college, I thought I wanted to be an applied mathematician—but I realized that for me the most important and interesting questions were the relationship between mathematical models [...] and tools and the cultural, political, and institutional authority that they hold. It very quickly became apparent that my field was history of science as opposed to a scientific field explicitly, though I still teach math through the summer school and I’ve taught math in college as well.
THC: As someone who studies the scientific community and process from the outside, what have you noticed that most scientists don’t realize?
Phillips: What I’ve noticed most is the discrepancy between the authority and deference that science and scientists receive, and the lack of knowledge about science broadly in society and the community. It’s amazing to me that people will defer to mathematical methods or scientists or the authority of certain kinds of knowledge claims even though they have no idea where they come from and can give no account of them.
THC: Many Americans trust math without understanding it. Do you think this trust is misplaced?
Phillips: We defer to certain mathematical ways of knowing even though we are not always aware or made aware of the kinds of tradeoffs that occur…If you cared about poetry, or religion, or history, [you] might have completely different ideas of which decision to make. But there’s not really a conversation about those tradeoffs. We typically say that mathematical methods are more powerful, more accurate, and more precise without really investigating what it means.
THC: You teach a class called “From Lab Rats to Venture Capitalists: The Making of a Scientist.” What inspired you to teach the course, who do you think should take it, and is there a take home message that everyone should learn at some point?
Phillips: I was inspired to teach the course because I think one way of answering complicated questions about who scientists are historically is to ask how they’re trained … The take home—the thing I think people will get out of this course—is the ability to be reflective about what we’re learning, why we’re learning, the institutions in which learning takes place, and  what is sometimes know as “the hidden curriculum,” the moral, political, and social standards that are communicated to us through these  institutions.
THC: Do you have any advice for students headed for careers in science?
Phillips: I think as a historian of science, I would encourage all science students to know something of the history of science—to really think critically not just about the future of their field, but also about the history of the field and about what they are doing in the context of the larger development of science as an institution and as a practice.
THC: Many people become scientists, far fewer study science from a historical or social perspective. Why do you think this research is important?
Phillips: If you’re interested in the way we live now, then certainly it should matter to you what role science plays in our lives, and how science came to play that role.  That’s the question that historians of science are constantly engaged with.

A team of researchers at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering recently announced a milestone in the development of a new biomedical technology that may make animal models a phenomenon of the past. The device, known as the “gut-on-a-chip,” simulates the microenvironment of the human intestine by creating a miniaturized three-dimensional scaffold that supports growth and development of a patient’s own cells—even including microbes essential for digestion and normal physiology.
The research team, led by Wyss Institute director Donald E. Ingber, is focusing on creating a system that can address fundamental problems in modern pharmacology and therapeutic research.
“The big inspiration really was being aware of the fact that there is a major crisis in getting drugs through development and clinical trials,” said Ingber. “There is also the problem that animal testing really doesn’t accurately predict what happens in humans.”
The device—which consists of a single layer of human intestinal epithelial cells that grow on a porous, flexible membrane—recreates the intestinal barrier. With proper implementation, the system can mimic the peristaltic motion of the digestive tract and facilitate the growth of valuable intestinal microbes within the luminal space.
“Normally, we have billions of bacteria living in the lumina of our gut and they are absolutely critical for survival, including absorption and metabolism,” said Ingber. “With the simulated flow and peristaltic-like motion, we were able to keep the cells alive—which means we can start doing toxicity testing and also look at complex disease processes in which the microbiome plays an essential role.”
By recapitulating human diseases with “gut-on-a-chip” technology, scientists may soon be able to pursue a more comprehensive understanding of cellular pathways and medical prognoses, according to Ingber. Amongst other gastrointestinal diseases, this technology may provide valuable insight into the mechanics underlying Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
“Not only could this drug be used in development of new treatments for many gastrointestinal diseases, but it could also be used to test mechanisms for drug delivery,” said Sujata Bhatia, Assistant Director for Undergraduate Studies in Biomedical Engineering. “I also believe that because this tool does such a nice job of mimicking the actual environment of the intestine, it could be an amazing tool for both biomedical students and biomedical engineers.”
Though this is a significant breakthrough for the biomedical field, Ingber says this is only the beginning.
“We are looking into a lung-on-a-chip and a beating heart-on-a-chip and [chips] that could link many organs together,” said Ingber. “This is the future challenge and we are very excited to look into that.”

With the publication of the online Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia—detailed in Nature last Thursday—researchers are one step closer to effective personalized cancer therapy.
The encyclopedia was a collaborative endeavor between the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the biotech company Novartis. It catalogues data on the genetic composition of nearly a thousand cancer cell lines—about 75 percent of those commercially available, according to Levi A. Garraway, senior academic author and member at the Broad Institute and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
Researchers looked for and analyzed mutations and variation in epigenetic control of expression in each cell line, said Gregory V. Kryukov, a senior computational biologist at the Broad Institute and co-author of the paper.
“Working on a project of that size is exciting but can involve some unglamorous work,” said Nicolas Stransky, co-first author and lead computational biologist for the project. “Someone has to carefully check the data so that in the end we have a resource of great quality.”
The encyclopedia will be a critical resource for scientists.
“So much cancer research has been carried out in a matter agnostic to the underlying genetics,” Garraway said. “It almost seems silly that you’re doing research on a genome without even knowing what is happing to the genome.”
By treating several hundred cell lines with various drugs, researchers were able to correlate drug sensitivity to specific genetic markers in the cell lines. This will provide researchers and doctors with greater predictive power—the ability to screen tumors and prescribe medication specifically suited to the genetic composition of the tumor.
“If it were not for the great variability between human individuals, medicine may be a science and not an art,” said Kryukov. “It’s really amazing how much data we have.”
As is the case with most large projects—the CCLE is the largest collection of cell line data to date—researchers working on the project experienced logistical challenges like obtaining cell lines.
“It’s easy to get lost in the amount of data,” said Stransky. “There are thousands of samples—the project can get very complex at times—but this is where we’ve been really lucky to collaborate with extremely efficient people.”
Research for the CCLE first began in early 2008 after nearly a year of contract negotiations between the Broad Institute and Novartis.
The delay was necessary so that researchers could ensure that “data generated by us on the academic side was completely going to be publically available,” said Garraway.
Companies must maintain a greater focus on the bottom line than academic institutions, but Garraway said that overall this was an advantage.
“It kept the project going and accountable in ways that we don’t necessarily do in such a strict way academically,” he said.
In fact, multiple researchers cited the interaction between scientists at the Broad and Novartis as one of the most engaging aspects of the project.
“Being really at the middle of all these people generating data at the Broad, I could see how everyone was interacting and collaborating,” said Stransky.
Kryukov said he anticipates at least two more years of work on the project to deepen characterization of existing cell lines and test new compounds.

Ally M. Freedy ’14 came to Harvard leaning heavily towards becoming a Neurobiology concentrator. At the beginning of freshman spring, she sought out research opportunities and secured a position in the lab of molecular and cellular biology professor Takaoa K. Hensch ’88, studying brain development.
However, within the first 12 months of college, Freedy determined that her true passion lay not in the science of the brain, but in chemistry.
By sophomore spring, Freedy had already accumulated a year’s worth of lab experience and all the associated acumen. But to broaden her research horizons, she enrolled in the class “Chemistry 100: Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Biology.”
The course is “designed to have students in lab as much as possible,” wrote chemistry and chemical biology lecturer and director of undergraduate laboratories Ryan M. Spoering in an email to The Crimson. Enrolled students work in pairs on a project, and their research is supervised by two teaching fellows. The course requires students to attend two five-hour lab sessions each week as well as a 90 minute session in which pairs present their progress the rest of the group.
According to Spoering, the distinguishing feature of this class is the autonomy it gives to students. Freedy describes Chemistry 100 as a class where you are doing “real research” because you are looking for answers that no one has ever found, rather than “doing something which has been done a million times before,” as in more basic courses that feature weekly lab components.
Freedy’s project involves synthesizing an improved version of existing PNA molecules. PNA, which stands for Peptide Nucleic Acid, is very similar in its structure to DNA, but instead of having an overall negative charge, it has a neutral charge. As a result, PNA is able to bind to other DNA molecules more efficiently. This property is powerful because it allows biologists and chemists to actively modify a strand of DNA. She said the molecule could be useful in fighting cancer, since PNA can target and bind to specific DNA strands, whereas traditional chemotherapy treatments cause additional damage to any rapidly dividing cells.
“It would only wipe out the cells in which that gene is overly expressive,” she said.
Freedy remarked that her background in neurobiology made working on this type of research particularly gratifying. She said she appreciates the balance of structure and freedom in her research class, especially because doing research in a young field like neurobiology was a little like “fumbling in the dark.”
Spoering also emphasized this notion of structured freedom within the class.
“Students can get a good sense of the challenge of research, of the effectiveness of applying their own ideas [..] ultimately this knowledge only comes through failing and figuring it out,” he wrote. “So Chem 100 is very flexible, the projects are designed to be starting points with many possibilities, and the course has minimal structure to get in the way of bench work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his 1959 lecture “The Two Cultures,” British physicist and novelist C.P. Snow famously lamented the gulf between scientists and literary intellectuals—thinkers who, although comparable in intelligence and social circumstance, shared such mutual incomprehension that in a trip from the scientific societies of South Kensington to the bohemian haunts of Chelsea, “one might have crossed an ocean.”
And if one actually traversed the Atlantic, Snow continued, “one found Greenwich Village talking precisely the same language as Chelsea, and both having about as much communication with MIT as though the scientists spoke nothing but Tibetan.”
But if Snow had visited MIT in 1959 and walked but two miles west, he would have found one newly appointed Harvard Professor of Zoology whose work on ants was about to catapult him toward both a prolific scientific and literary career: Edward O. Wilson.
After a half-century’s work at Harvard, Wilson is regarded as the father of sociobiology—the biological study of behavior. He has written over 25 books, two of which won Pulitzer Prizes. Now, at the age of 82, he presents his summa work, “The Social Conquest of Earth,” which will be released on April 9. It is a radical treatise on the human condition, and an attempt to overturn the very evolutionary ideas that have distinguished him as “Darwin’s natural heir.”
Wilson frames “The Social Conquest of Earth” as a dialogue with painter Paul Gauguin, who penned on the canvas of his 1897 Tahitian masterpiece: “Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?”
The painting, which graces the book’s cover, provocatively depicts Wilson’s dual identity as a man of science and letters.
“Innovators in both of two domains are basically dreamers and storytellers,” Wilson writes. “In the early stages of creation of both art and science, everything in the mind is a story…some [parts] which are discarded and new ones added.”
SCHOPENHAUER’S THREE STAGES
Wilson discards and adds evolutionary ideas aggressively in “The Social Conquest of Earth.”  In a professional about-face, he argues that “eusociality”—which describes a group of organisms with members that forego reproduction to carry out specialized labor—does not evolve through kin selection, a theory which he helped champion at the height of his career.
First proposed by British biologist W.D. Hamilton in 1964, kin selection explains that under certain circumstances, an organism will forego reproduction—the ultimate Darwinian sacrifice—to promote the survival of those who are genetically related to it. Kin selection explains the existence of sterile female worker castes of ants, wasps, and bees—who peculiarly share more genetic similarity with each other than they would with their offspring. According to Hamilton, this altruism is a façade: it is in the sisters’ evolutionary interest to care for their queen, who would bear them more sisters, than to propagate their genes through their own reproduction.
If Hamiltonian kin selection was sociobiology’s gospel, Wilson was its evangelist—he advocated the theory in his field-defining 1975 work, “Sociobiology: The New Synthesis.” In the work, Wilson applied kin selection to the persistence of altruistic behavior from insects to the higher vertebrates.
It was in his final extension of kin selection to human beings—proposing that altruism and morality were in fact evolutionary adaptive, and employed in one’s self-interest—that Wilson came under fire.
“I thought my ideas would be welcomed, but boy, no person in the history of science was ever more wrong,” Wilson says.
“It was the white heat of the Cold War,” he continued, and he faced vicious animosity from leftist social intellectuals who recoiled at his proposal of a genetically determined human nature. The idea of “nature over nurture”—that one’s nature was shaped by genes—uncomfortably echoed the eugenic bigotry of the Nazis.
Nearly four decades later, Wilson remains unafraid to advocate unpopular ideas. Furthermore, he has shown, with the mark of a scientist, that he is willing to change his mind.
In recent years, he has felt that evidence for kin selection beyond the eusocial ants, bees, and wasps has grown equivocal, and has admitted that he was mistaken in supporting it.
“The beautiful theory never worked well anyway,” he writes, “and now it has collapsed.”
In its place, Wilson poses a new theory of eusocial evolution called “group-selection” as the driving factor toward eusociality and altruistic behavior.
Group selection acts not on the traits of an individual organism, but on those of a well-defined group that can reproduce itself as a unit and compete with other groups of the same species. Eusociality is selected for through the formation of groups that come by chance to establish a defensible, communal “nest” and acquire mutations that diminish the instinct for dispersal. From these conditions develop eusocial traits like caste determination, division of labor, and communication. Wilson argues that only after these traits are established do groups of organisms begin to display the genetic relatedness attributed to kin selection.
In 2010, Wilson partnered with mathematicians Martin A. Nowak, who is the director of Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, and Corina E. Tarnita ’06 to present the theory of group selection in a “Nature” article titled “The Evolution of Eusociality.”
The response was not one of political furor, as in 1975, but of scientific outrage. In a promptly written rebuttal that contained nearly 140 signatures, Wilson’s colleagues protested that the paper was published on grounds of reputation rather than sound science.
“It was an A to Z of the most important people in social evolution, and they all think it’s bogus,” says OEB Lecturer Andrew Berry. “Kin selection has allowed for beautiful insights and has proven predictive power—it would be insane to throw it away.”
Even Richard Dawkins, one of Wilson’s greatest supporters, could not accept his change of heart. But co-discoverer of the DNA double helix James D. Watson—an early departmental rival whom Wilson once described as “the most unpleasant human being” he had ever met—has pledged his support, and remains unfazed by the controversy.
“Both Ed and I are old enough to know that there are critics—and then there are critics,” he says. “We were grown up before the time of political correctness so we’re not at all bothered by offending anyone—including each other.”
“In time we realized we even liked each other,” he adds with a laugh.
Perhaps it is Wilson’s age that allows him to take on the controversy with similar lightheartedness.
He has taken to paraphrasing Arthur Schopenhauer, as he did on this occasion, to describe how he shepherds young scientific ideas—first kin selection, and now its challenger, group selection—through three phrases.
“First, the truth is ridiculed,” he says. “Then it meets outrage, and then it is says to have been obvious all along. We’re currently in the outrage stage, but I think before long it will be obvious.”
PART SAINT, PART SINNER
In “The Social Conquest of Earth,” Wilson distills group selection into a single “iron rule” of evolution: selfish individuals will beat altruistic individuals, but altruistic groups will beat selfish groups.
“If our behavior was driven entirely by group selection, then we’d be robotic cooperators, like ants,” he writes. “But, if individual selection was the only thing that mattered, then we’d be entirely selfish.”
The result of the constant tension between these two selective extremes, Wilson writes, is our human nature: the malleable expression of genes that shapes the way our senses perceive the world, the options for action that we pose to ourselves, and the decisions that we find most satisfying to make.
The tension between individual and group selection has also resulted in giving us a conflicted nature of motivations.
“It renders each of us part saint and part sinner,” he writes, tracing the origin of human morality, honor, and religion through the lens of group selection.
OEB Professor Richard C. Lewontin, one of the fiercest critics of the 1975 “Sociobiology,” holds that Wilson’s inquiries fall outside the domain of science.
“The impulse to make grand generalizations about our world is very powerful—we’ve all been taught that this is what it takes to make a great scientist, like a Newton or a Darwin,” Lewontin says.
“The danger of this impulse,” he continued, “is to tell a ‘Just So Story’ like Rudyard Kipling’s ‘How the Camel Got His Hump.’ I fear that Wilson has been lured down that path.”
It is true that Wilson is relentless in chasing stories—and the story of our evolution is among the grandest. But he is unapologetic. “There is a real creation story of humanity, and only one,” he writes, “and it is not a myth.”
THE TWO CULTURES
Echoing C.P. Snow’s 1959 lament near the end of his book, Wilson writes, “If there was a reason for bringing the humanities and science closer together, it is the need to understand the true nature of the human sensory world.”
He holds that the humanities, however fruitful, are filtered through what he describes as “the narrow biological channels of human cognition”: our eyes capture only a miniscule fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum, while our ears catch only a few frequencies of sound and our noses even fewer chemical scents.
The scientist works to heighten and extend our senses to fill in the details.
“In my fieldwork as a scientist, I can leave the intellectualization of academy behind me and become a hunter of a scientific bent, investing myself in something extremely literal—in touch, smell, taste, and sight,” Wilson says. “But when I write, it’s a different kind of discipline, and it becomes my objective to illuminate my experiences in nature in a captivating way.”
In this light, Wilson attempts to answer Gauguin in “The Social Conquest of Earth” by embracing the existential questioning of the humanities without sacrificing the “unrelenting application of reason” at the core of empirical science.
Balancing these motivations, as C.P. Snow writes, is the challenge: “the clashing point of two subjects, two disciplines, two cultures—of two galaxies—[ought] to produce creative chances.”
As a man of two cultures, E.O. Wilson—ever the dreamer, ever the storyteller—is one such creative chance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Senator Scott Brown announced Friday that his campaign for reelection raised $3.4 million in the first three months of 2012, pushing his total cash reserve to about $15 million.
Brown’s first quarter total is a slight increase from the last quarter of 2011, when he raised $3.2 million. According to a press release from the campaign, 71 percent of Brown’s first quarter donors are from the Bay State, again a slight increase from the last reporting period.
“The people of Massachusetts appreciate the independent, pro-jobs perspective that Senator Brown brings to each issue and they have rewarded him with yet another strong quarter of fundraising,” said John Cook, Brown’s campaign finance director, in a statement.
Brown’s Democratic opponent, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, has yet to disclose her own fundraising totals but announced in an email to supporters Wednesday that her campaign has raised $2.5 million from more than 30,000 donors in Massachusetts alone.
Political analysts expect that Warren’s first quarter total will likely exceed Brown’s. Warren’s fundraising has outpaced Brown’s in each of the last two quarters. As of the end of 2011, Warren had raised a total of $8.8 million.
Despite Warren’s stronger fundraising, 2011 returns revealed that Brown had twice as much cash on hand, since he has bolstered his bid for reelection with unspent funds raised during his 2010 race. Even if Warren posts strong numbers on par with the nearly $6 million she raised last quarter, experts said she will likely still trail the incumbent senator.
“She’s done surprisingly well for a first-time candidate. That said, no matter what, she’s going to have to close the gap,” said Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh.
The race is considered one of the most important in the country this election season for its strategic and symbolic value. Warren hopes to retake a seat that was held by Democratic mainstay Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 for 46 years before Brown won it for the Republicans in 2010.
In accordance with the national attention focused on the race, experts expect it to be one of the most expensive Senate campaigns this year as well.
Both Brown and Warren have drawn a great deal of money from out-of-state donors. Warren in particular has drawn Republican criticism for the lucrative backing she has received from Hollywood and other prominent California Democrats.
“In a sense, it’s a national campaign,” said Harvard Kennedy School lecturer M. Marty Linsky. “Because of what the campaign represents, both of them will be attracting huge amounts of out-of-state money, and that has its own consequences.”
A recent poll by The Boston Globe showed Brown and Warren in a statistical tie with the election a little more than a half a year away.
Warren’s complete fundraising numbers could be released as early as next week, but the Federal Election Commission does not require candidates to file until April 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore softball player Kasey Lange has a lot going on in her life. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year and All-Ivy third baseman is currently batting .346 with four home runs as she leads her team in its title defense. The neurobiology concentrator and Currier House resident has quite a few connections to Crimson athletics beyond the diamond. Her boyfriend, sophomore Tom Hamel, is a forward on the men’s basketball team and her roommate, sophomore Jacquelyn Cooley, played outfield alongside Lange last season before switching over to the sailing team this year. But which of the two knows the slugger better? The best friend or the apple of her eye? To find out, we gave Kasey a few questions and asked Tom and Jacquelyn to guess her answers. So what will it be? For love, or the game?
Kasey Lange, sophomore third baseman
Favorite Movie: Bridesmaids
Pre-game superstition: My lucky ribbon and eating Pinkberry
Proudest Athletic Moment: Winning the Ivy League title last year
Most Embarrassing Athletic Moment: Falling off a treadmill after a treadmill sprint
Guilty Pleasure: Felipe's nachos

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of the 2011 season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team found itself tied for second-to-last in the EIVA rankings with only one conference win to its name.
But 2012 has been an entirely different story, as the Crimson has stormed to second place in the conference and is on the brink of guaranteeing itself a place in the EIVA semifinals in late April.
To do so, Harvard (16-3, 8-2 EIVA) will have to overcome stiff challenges from the two teams flanking the Crimson in the rankings, as the squad travels to Pennsylvania to take on third-place St. Francis and conference leaders, No. 7 Penn State.
"Last year…we were hanging in there with teams but not getting the wins that we needed," sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. "So to not only be getting those wins, but looking at the playoffs this year is pretty cool. All the guys on the team are pretty excited."
The Crimson should expect an easier matchup Friday night against St. Francis (11-13, 6-5 EIVA), as Harvard comfortably won their last meeting in straight sets. But considering the importance of the final games, the Crimson is not taking anything for granted.
"St. Francis is going to come out hard," Gibbons said. "They are fighting to stay alive and find a way into the playoffs. But we know their tendencies. We’ve watched a lot of film on them…so we have a pretty good game plan for our defense."
A road win Friday night against the Red Flash would lock up a spot in the EIVA semifinals, and would also go a long way in assuring Harvard at least the two seed heading into the conference tournament.
But to do that, the Crimson will face two strong middle blockers in Adam Roche and Mark Kochan. Roche currently leads the EIVA and ranks third in the country in blocks per set with 1.54. Kochan sits at fourth in the league with 1.14.
Harvard will rely on outside hitters Nick Madden and co-captain Matt Jones, who currently ranks third in the conference in kills per set (3.74), to break through the St. Francis defense.
Freshman outside hitter DJ White, third in the EIVA in hitting percentage (.329) must also make an offensive impact for the Crimson to earn the win on Friday.
Saturday will be a clash of two of the best hitting and serving teams in the country.
The Nittany Lions (18-3, 11-0 EIVA) and Harvard rank fifth and sixth, respectively, in hitting percentage, with both teams registering almost 13 kills per set.
Penn State is led by outside hitter Joe Sunder. The 6’7" junior boasts the highest hitting percentage (.339) in the EIVA.
At the heart of its defense, the Crimson looks to Gibbons to resist its opponent’s strong hitting. Gibbons paces Harvard with 2.31 digs per set and is known for his ability to make impressive defensive bids to keep points alive.
The Nittany Lions also have strong service from middle hitter Nick Turko, who maintains the second-best service ace per set ratio in the EIVA. It was the overpowering service from Turko and the rest of the Penn State lineup that prevented the Crimson from finding its offensive rhythm in its Feb. 17th loss at the Malkin Athletic Center.
But Harvard has powerful serves of its own, as Jones has kicked up his jump serve for the Crimson as of late. The senior now ranks fourth in the country in service aces per set, with .47 per set.
"Last time we played them, the key was our serve-receive and blocking," Madden said. "We worked a lot in practice on those things. We got a serving machine this week, and we could practice the same serve in hard areas and get a lot of good reps."
The top spot in the conference, while mathematically possible for Harvard, would require both the Nittany Lions dropping all four of their remaining games and the Crimson winning its final four games. And as Penn State has only lost three games all season and maintains a perfect conference record, that scenario does not appear likely.
But despite their pristine EIVA record, Harvard is still gunning to knock the Nittany Lions off of their perch.
"They have definitely had their moments in the season when they have shown some weaknesses," Gibbons said. "We have been looking to take advantage of that."
And Gibbons knows that this might not be the last time the two teams meet.
"Assuming we do make the playoffs, Penn State is likely going to be the rival that we are going against to see if we can make the NCAA tournament," Gibbons said. "So this is a nice preview for us to see what the outcome could be at the end of the playoffs."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In each of the past three years, the result has been the same.
Every time the current seniors on the Harvard men’s lacrosse team have taken on Cornell in a regular season contest during their collegiate careers, the final scoreboard has read: Cornell 13, Harvard 12.
Last year, the one-goal defeat cost the Crimson an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Harvard got another shot at the Big Red in the Ivy championship game a few weeks later, but fell, 15-6.
So in this season’s version of the rivalry, the Crimson (5-4, 2-0 Ivy) only has one goal: to finally get over the big, red hump.
"I’ve had this game circled since last year when we lost to them in the Ivy League tournament," sophomore attackman Dan Eipp said. "I’ve never felt so down than after that game."
"[The three straight 13-12 losses are] definitely kind of a funny thing that have been in the back of everyone’s mind this week," tri-captain Terry White added. "We need to get a little motivation from it and then put that behind us and have confidence in our gameplan when it comes time to play."
But pulling out a win in Ithaca will be no easy task. No. 5 Cornell (7-1, 3-0) currently holds the longest home winning streak in the nation at 13 games and is 62-23 all-time against Harvard.
This season, the Big Red offense is as good as ever. Cornell ranks seventh nationally with 12.75 scores per game and has tallied 16, 17, 18, and 19 goals in individual contests this year.
But for the past six matches, that attack has been without one giant piece—senior Rob Pannell, who is widely considered to be the best player in the country. The 2011 USILA National Player of the Year, Lt. Raymond Enners Award winner, and No. 1 overall pick in the 2012 Major League Lacrosse Draft broke a bone in his foot in Cornell’s Mar. 3 defeat of Army, leaving him out six weeks.
With Pannell out, a number of players have picked up the offensive slack. Steve Mock leads the squad with 18 goals, while Chris Langton and Connor English have each scored 13 times. Matt Donovan paces the squad with 11 assists.
"[Pannell’s] obviously a great player," White said. "He does huge things for them. But I think what we’ve seen this year is that they have a really balanced offense and a ton of different guys contributing. It’s almost going to call on us to play a more complete game defensively. We’re not using [Pannell’s injury] to take them lightly, because it’s more difficult to beat a team than it is to take down a single person."
But the Cornell defense will certainly have its eye on one individual—Harvard senior attackman Jeff Cohen, who ranks second in the nation in goals (36) and goals per game (four). This Saturday could potentially be a historic one for Cohen, who is just two tallies away from tying Dave Bohn ’60 for first place on the Crimson all-time scoring list.
"We’re not really sure what exactly their defense is going to do, but it’s very probable that they’ll shut off Cohen," said Eipp, who ranks second on the team with 19 scores. "I personally don’t think that’s going to throw him off his game, because he’s so good in the crease that he finds a way of getting open and scoring."
The Big Red has been inconsistent in Pannell’s absence, taking No. 1 Virginia to overtime but struggling against Ivy foes Yale and Dartmouth, whom it beat by just one and two goals, respectively.
Nonetheless, Harvard will have its hands full against a Cornell defense that ranks eighth in the country playing in front of sophomore goalie Andrew West, who is ninth nationally with a 7.37 goals-against average. But Eipp thinks the Crimson—which is off to its first 2-0 start in conference play since 1998—can get the job done.
“If we move the ball and play unselfishly, we shouldn’t have a problem against their defense,” the sophomore said.
Between the opposite set of pipes will be Crimson goalie Jake Gambitsky, who took over the starting job midway through in the season.
"I think Jake’s getting better and better each game," Eipp said. "I feel very comfortable with our defense, and especially him leading the defense."
But Gambitsky, a freshman, has not had to experience the numerous heartbreaking defeats that his senior teammates have endured at the hands of the Big Red, giving them extra motivation tomorrow afternoon.
"It’s a game we always have marked on our calendars," White said. "Cornell is the only team that our class of seniors hasn’t beaten in the Ivy League. There’s definitely revenge on our minds.... It’s huge for us."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Kentucky’s victory over Kansas Monday night in the NCAA tournament signaled the official conclusion of the winter sports season, spring athletics have been rolling for over a month now. The story lines are coming into ever clearer view, the trajectories of the teams now decipherable and somewhat predictable. Yes, we’re long past the stage that so often characterizes the start of a season, when teams are infected by that bug called unbridled optimism.
You know that phase; it’s not confined to the field or the diamond or the court. But boy, on those playing surfaces, the disease does perhaps its most deadly work. All of a sudden, every player is an all-star. Every team is a championship-caliber squad.
Of course, sometimes those preseason hopes are vindicated. But other times, they’re more off-target than Carl Lewis’ rendition of the National Anthem.
And Harvard teams are no exception to that rule. In an interview before the 2011 season, Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh proclaimed, "I’m not going to give you a ‘we’re cautiously optimistic’ or anything. We’re good. We’re good right now." But the team wasn’t good then or at all in 2011, stumbling to a lowly 9-36 mark and a last-place finish in the Red Rolfe Division.
This year, for certain teams, expectations were equally high. Ranked No. 14/15 before the start of the season, the men’s lacrosse team had what some called the best recruiting class in Ivy League men’s lacrosse history. For others, like baseball, after last year’s debacle, expectations were a bit more tempered.
Over the past month and change, these expectations have squared off against optimism’s antidote—reality—thereby morphing the predictions of the season.
For the spring teams, these outcomes are still far foregone conclusions. But for many, this weekend is a crossroads. It’s not do-or-die yet, not by a long shot, but victories would be critical, much-needed momentum boosts that could carry the teams towards fulfilling those lofty preseason ambitions.
Take baseball. The team’s ugly 4-19 record doesn’t convey the whole story. Eleven of the Crimson’s 19 losses have been by two runs or fewer, and seven of the defeats came against top-25 teams. Most importantly, the team’s first 22 games came away from O’Donnell Field. In game No. 23, the home opener, Harvard topped ACC opponent and crosstown rival Boston College, 5-3.
With this victory in hand, the Crimson, which has a 1-3 conference record, has a chance to make a move this weekend in back-to-back doubleheaders at home against Ivy League foes Columbia and Penn, respectively. Four wins, and Harvard could quite possibly be sitting atop the Red Rolfe Division. The Crimson, somehow, still has a shot at the division crown this year, if for no other reason that the league is horrendous. Dartmouth has the best overall record at 5-13, followed by Yale at 6-18-1.
But four losses, which would give Harvard a 1-7 league mark with 40 percent of Ancient Eight play in the books, and the Crimson would likely be in a Soldiers-Field sized hole.
This isn’t just a critical weekend for baseball, though. Men’s lacrosse, after falling out of the national rankings, travels to Ithaca, N.Y. to square off against a No. 5 Cornell team that picked Harvard apart last year in the Ivy League Tournament Championship, 15-6. A win on Saturday, and Harvard grabs back some of that lost national prestige, not to mention securing a firmer hold on first place in the division. A loss, and Harvard’s largely back to where it was last year: second fiddle to the Big Red.
And there are more. Like women’s lacrosse, which hosts Brown on Saturday and will either move to 2-2 or 1-3 in conference play. In a seven-game league slate, that’s a sizable one-game flip. Or men’s volleyball, which will try to secure an enormous boost going into the conference tournament this weekend with a victory over league juggernaut Penn State. And men’s tennis, which, riding a 12-game winning streak and a national ranking, now enters league play. A top-25 ranking is nice, but what does it mean without an Ivy title?
For these spring teams, the end of the season is fast approaching. The chips are down. It won’t be long before we know if baseball was dealt the 7-2 off suit like last year and if men’s lacrosse got the ace-king suited. It won’t be long before we know who’s got the killer hand and who’s got, well, nothing.
This weekend will be a good indication of exactly what’s in the cards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the recent end to Linsanity, we at The Back Page wanted to say a final adieu to all the puns, merchandise, and slogans out there that were a little, well, linsensative to Jeremy Lin ’10. And how else would we do that other than by rank.
5. We all know that the New York Post likes to think of the most outrageous, punny headlines possible. The question here, though, is is this too far? Judge for yourself. After Lin hit a three-pointer to capture a win over the Toronto Raptors on Feb 14, the NYP decided to go all-in with this headline: “Amasian!”
4. Before all the hype, Lin wasn’t quite as well known. In fact, the “Voice of the Clippers” Ralph Lawler didn’t know him at all in late 2010, accidentally replacing the name “Lin” with “Lee”. On national TV. Ouch.
3. Getting hurt isn’t a funny situation. But, for thousands on the internet, the puns just kept on coming when it was announced that the Harvard alum would miss six weeks due to a torn meniscus. Naturally this involved into a “torn Liniscus,” a “Linjury,” and, of course, a “oh-hopefully-he-won’t-be-walking-with-a Linp.”
2. At our very own Harvard Square Ben & Jerry’s, the ice cream franchise decided to make a claim of its own in the Lin craze. Unfortunately, it did this through creating a flavor whose ingredients included bits of fortune cookies and lychee honey, an ill-judged reference to Lin’s heritage. Bad form, Ben & Jerry’s, bad form.
1. The name of ESPN, the self-proclaimed “Worldwide Leader In Sports”, should be synonymous with professionalism, class, and headlines that aren’t incredibly politically incorrect. Clearly no one told that to Anthony Federico, a former ESPN employee who, after a bad night on the court for Lin and the Knicks, decided to post the slur of “Chink in the Armor” as the international headline to the less controversial article.  Federico was fired shortly thereafter.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:

April 2, 1929: Historic Engine Makes Debut in Square Today
At exactly five minutes past one today a fire engine of the Cambridge Catamounts, historic New England fire-fighting aggregation, drawn by six "Fire B'hoys" will make its appearance on Harvard Square.
The engine, the one to be used by the Hasty Pudding Club for its production "Fireman, Save my Child," will start from an unrevealed place on Church Street and go up to the Square.
April 1, 1937: More Athletics Asked for by Law School Students
Law School students are making a concerted demand upon the H.A.A. and University Hall through the means of a special committee appointed by the Law School Committee of Phillips Brooks House for better and wider athletic facilities.
In a letter which was sent to President Conant, the director of athletics, William J. Bingham '12, the Dean of the Law School, James M. Landis, the Corporation, the Board of Overseers, and the Hygiene Building through Arlie V. Bock, Henry K. Oliver Professor of Hygiene, as well as others, the committee made plain that they desired that a wholly new plan of athletics be put into force for the Law School.
Specifically they are desirous that there be a paid secretary appointed by the H.A.A. to organize intra-mural sports for the Law School dormitories. It is expected that touch football teams and soft ball baseball teams will be organized among the Law School Halls, and among those outside the Halls.
April 6, 1953: Communists Unqualified for Faculty Posts, States Report of Universities
Communists are unqualified to teach in the universities, and professors should be wary of hiding under the Fifth Amendment, according to a statement of the Association of American Universities, issued over the vacation.
Provost Buck officially represented Harvard at the meeting of the 37 colleges, which also urged universities to cooperate with legislative inquiries.
April 6, 1970: Professors Seek Autonomy for Social Psychologists
The decision of Harvard sociologists to leave the Social Relations Department and form a department of their own has encouraged some social psychologists in Soc Rel to consider taking similar action.
The Soc Rel faculty approved on March 6 the creation of an independent Sociology Department, subject to final approval by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The fields of social psychology, developmental and personality psychology, and social anthropology remained within Soc Rel.
"What's left is a kind of 'Remnant Relations,'" Thomas F. Pettingrew, professor of Social Psychology, said yesterday. "It makes very little intellectual sense and is extremely bad for the development of social psychology."
Pettigrew has suggested that social psychology combine with developmental and personality psychology, with social anthropology shifting to the Anthropology Department.
April 4, 1980: Toxic Fog Drifts over Area
A railroad tank car rupture in Somerville sent a huge white cloud of toxic gas drifting over parts of that city, Cambridge and Boston yesterday, forcing thousands to flee their homes and jobs, and sending 100 victims to local hospitals.
Police evacuated nearly 10,000 residents from parts of Somerville yesterday, while in nearby East Cambridge officials bused students to schools in other parts of the city, away from the haze of phosphorous tricloride.
Workers covered the last puddles of leaked phosphorus trichloride with dirt last night, and officials said the area was out of immediate danger as evacuated residents began to return to their homes.

"Titanic 3D" hits theaters today, and everybody's wondering: What is going to happen in this movie? Oh, wait...
It's been fifteen years since the story was suspenseful, so spice up your re-viewing with a little alcoholic fun. The Titanic's sinking (spoiler alert!), so let's get drinking.
Whenever someone says the word "unsinkable," toast to dramatic irony.
If someone talks about the diamond, take a drink.
If someone stares at the diamond with an intense gaze, take a drink.
Drink every time you see a scene that has sexual implications you did not understand as a child.
Drink every time a teardrop falls into your glass. Salty!
Kate and Leo look so young. Slurp, slurp, slurp every time you think about that.
If Cal says or does something evil, take a sip and then spit it towards his face on the screen.
Drink every time you hear the words "women and children."
How did the same person who crafted this tragic love story also write "Avatar"? You can dwell on that thought, or you can erase it with a drink.
Take a drink every time Kathy Bates is randomly on screen. (This can apply to any movie.)
Everything's cooler in 3D, so take a salutatory drink to the future.
Now that you're equipped, go hit the cinema with some friends and some tissues. The main goal is to anesthetize the ending—it's really sad.

Are you nostalgic for those Easter Sunday mornings when you raced your siblings to find the last hidden egg? Just in case you find yourself in the Easter spirit this weekend, Flyby is here to suggest some easy ways for you to ditch all that homework and feel like a child again.
