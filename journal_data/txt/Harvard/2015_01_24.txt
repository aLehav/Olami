After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of 38 Harvard Law School professors have signed a letter “in support of” Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, who was recently accused of having sexual relations with a minor who was allegedly trafficked by billionaire Jeffrey E. Epstein.
In the letter, the professors argue that Dershowitz was unable to directly respond to the recent allegations in a legal setting, citing the fact that he does not have standing in the civil case in which the allegations of sexual misconduct were first filed and that Dershowitz denies.
“Responding to highly destructive and highly publicized allegations requires finding a forum that can credibly resolve the disputed facts,” they wrote. “The courts should not be used to make such attacks while preventing any effective response.”
The civil court case in which the allegations surfaced challenges a plea deal that Dershowitz helped to negotiate for Epstein, who pleaded guilty in state court to soliciting prostitution, but per the plea deal, avoided federal prosecution. Dershowitz is not named as a defendant in the civil case, but has filed to intervene in the case to protect his “reputational interest.”
A group of three Law School faculty members—Nancy Gertner, Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., and Philip B. Heymann—began the effort to write the letter in support of their colleague late last week, Gertner and Heymann said. Initially, 36 Law School faculty members had signed the letter when Gertner shared it with The Crimson early Thursday morning, and two more—Charles R. Nesson ’60 and Lewis D. Sargentich—have added their names since.
In an interview, Heymann said he took issue with how “Jane Doe No. 3’s” lawyers presented their allegations against Dershowitz.
"[The allegations have] been set up, either purposely or by accident, I don't know which, in a way that denies him all opportunity to defend his reputation [in court]," Heymann said, adding that "he can say it, but to have the [charges] resolved officially [in court] has been put out of reach."
The professors’ letter comes just after “Jane Doe No. 3” signed a sworn affidavit reaffirming her earlier allegations in a court filing submitted in response to Dershowitz’s intervention motion.
Gertner and Heymann said they were not aware that “Jane Doe No. 3” had filed the sworn affidavit when they released the letter, but Gertner said she still would have signed it if she had known about the affidavit. She said the issue at hand is Dershowitz’s ability to respond to the allegations and defend himself.
In an interview, Dershowitz said he was thankful to his colleagues for voicing their support.
“I appreciate their willingness to support me in a time of difficulty,” he said.
The letter is not the first time in recent months that a group of Law School professors has spoken out publicly about those accused of sexual misconduct. In October, a group of 28 Law School professors wrote an open letter to The Boston Globe criticizing Harvard’s University-wide sexual harassment policy and procedures.
Heymann said that in his tenure at the Law School, he has never seen as many faculty members sign an open letter as the 38 signatories supporting Dershowitz.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: JANUARY 24, 2015, at 10:30 a.m.
ITHACA, N.Y. — Third-line center Eric Freschi scored with 40.3 seconds left in regulation to lift Cornell, 3-2, over the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s hockey team on Friday night.
With under a minute to go, Big Red (8-8-2, 6-5-0) senior Cole Bardreau pushed the puck up ice in the midst of a Crimson line change, catching the visitors on a 3-on-2. Bardreau connected with Freschi, who beat junior goaltender Steve Michalek nearside from the top of the left faceoff circle, sending the Lynah Rink faithful into a frenzy.
For Harvard (11-4-2, 7-3-2 ECAC), it was a frustrating finish to a game that led to possibly more important losses than the one on the scoreboard. Top-pair junior defenseman Patrick McNally and second-line sophomore forward Luke Esposito left the first period with injuries. Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 does not expect them to return for Saturday’s game against Colgate.
McNally and Esposito’s departures placed extra responsibility on an already-understaffed Crimson roster, which entered Friday without the services of both sophomore centers Alex Kerfoot and Sean Malone for the fifth straight game. After starting the season 10-1-2, Harvard has now dropped three of its last four.
“I’m disappointed,” Donato said. “I’m frustrated, but [I] mostly just feel bad for the guys because I know with the short numbers, guys were really battling.”
McNally crumpled to the ice at 5:58 after an errant Cornell stick tripped him up at the Crimson goal line. It was the second time in four games that the junior was forced to the dressing room early, with McNally having sustained an upper body injury against Yale on Jan. 10. He would leave the rink on crutches with a wrapped ankle.
Esposito followed McNally 10 minutes later, clutching his left arm after tangling sticks with Big Red center Jared Fiegl off a faceoff in the Harvard zone. He would leave the rink sporting a large ice compress.
In response to McNally and Esposito’s absence, Donato shuffled combinations, moving freshman center Eddie Ellis up to fill Esposito’s spot on the second line.
Jimmy Vesey opened the scoring two minutes into the second frame with his team-best 15th goal of the season. The junior forward sprawled around Cornell senior defender Joakim Ryan to put back a rebound created from the left point by freshman defenseman Wiley Sherman.
Yet the Big Red responded with two quick strikes off Crimson turnovers.
Bardreau found Michalek’s top shelf at 4:28 of the middle frame off a rush created by sophomore winger Jake Weidner. Junior forward Christian Hilbrich followed less than two minutes later, finishing a 3-on-2 low in the slot on a feed from freshman linemate Dwyer Tschantz.
The game’s physicality increased throughout the second period as Harvard struggled to beat sophomore goaltender Mitch Gillam. The Crimson spent six of the frame’s final 13 minutes on the penalty kill, and sophomore forward Tyler Moy shot wide on a shorthanded breakaway midway through the period.
The Harvard power play, meanwhile, continued its recent struggles, going 0-for-3 on the night and generating few shots on goal with the extra man.
“It’s certainly tough when you’re changing two out of the five pieces on your first power play going into a game…but there are no excuses,” Donato said. “We need to generate more opportunities, more shots, and it’s something we’ll continue to look at.”
The Crimson gained momentum in the third period as Ellis delivered an equalizer at 6:26 in the frame. The freshman netted his first career goal on a redirection in front of the net following a slap shot from sophomore blue liner Victor Newell.
Harvard held the Big Red to only three shots on goal in the final 20 minutes, yet the hosts caught the Crimson flat-footed in crunch time. Ryan stopped a clear attempt by Ellis at the Cornell blueline and forwarded the puck to Bardreau to gain a game-winning head step on a Harvard line change.
“The shot had eyes a little bit,” Donato said. “And that’s all it took.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 24, 2015
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Cornell's Joakim Ryan caught Harvard's clear attempt with his glove before Cornell's game winning goal in the third period. In fact, Ryan handled the puck with his stick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a little over 13 minutes remaining, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers found a slicing Wesley Saunders streak across the lane. The senior wing received the ball before immediately sending it back to Chambers in the left corner. Chambers put the rock on the floor, giving Saunders enough time to sprint to the top of the key, where, moments later, he would catch, shoot, and drill a trey.
While the three-pointer gave the Harvard men’s basketball team a 43-29 lead over Dartmouth—its biggest advantage of the night—it was also the last highlight reel-type moment of the afternoon for the Crimson, as its highest high led to a series of lows, culminating in Dartmouth’s 26-2 run minutes later.
With its offense struggling and the Big Green (8-8, 1-1 Ivy) surging, Harvard (11-5, 1-1) couldn’t hold on to its lead and fell, 70-61, Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We came out with a lot of energy to start the second half, but we didn’t sustain it—they kept chipping away and chipping away, and finally broke through,” Saunders explained. “And that was the difference in the game.”
The moment that Saunders’s shot went through the hoop, the Big Green turned to junior guards Alex Mitola and Malik Gill to shoulder the majority of the offensive burden for the remainder the half. And from that play on—the 13:09 mark of the second period—the backcourt duo outscored the entire Crimson squad, 20-18.
The offensive onslaught began on a Gill layup and continued when Mitola drilled a right-wing three to bring his team within seven. Two assists and a steal from Gill in the next few minutes enabled Dartmouth to tie up the ballgame for the first time since the opening period, and, fittingly, it was Gill who responded to Harvard’s first basket in six minutes, penetrating into the paint, converting the layup, and drawing the fifth foul on co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi.
With Moundou-Missi sidelined and the Big Green streaking, the Crimson wouldn’t score again for over three minutes, at which point it was too little, too late.
“They scrapped and clawed and we weren’t efficient,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We had [] offensive droughts that hurt us.... We had chances to finish around the rim, we just didn’t do enough that we needed to do.”
MISTAKE MANAGEMENT
While Harvard’s season thus far has been unpredictable at best, it was perhaps the most obvious commonality of its first 15 games that came back to hurt the home team on Saturday.
It was a turnover that led to Dartmouth’s game-tying layup with 7:44 to play and it was a turnover that gave way to a Big Green three-pointer that earned the underdog a double-digit advantage, 55-45, capping off the 26-2 run. These were just two of the 18 mistakes that Harvard committed on the afternoon, its most since its second game of the season against Holy Cross over two months ago.
“It was obviously a tough afternoon for us,” Amaker said. “It was very disappointing in terms of how we handled the ball and how we couldn’t finish.”
While Saunders, per usual, was the Crimson’s go-to man on both the offensive and defensive ends, pacing his team with 13 points, six rebounds, and four steals, he also had a game-high six mistakes, three of them coming in the span of four minutes amidst Dartmouth’s comeback effort.
The Big Green managed to score off of more than half of its opponent’s turnovers, tallying 21 points off mistakes and six in transition. Harvard, meanwhile, notched only seven points off turnovers, a discrepancy that ended up being the difference in the game.
ALL OVER AGAIN
As the clock ticked towards the final minute of play on Saturday afternoon, there was a feeling of déjà vu in Lavietes Pavilion.
Two years ago, these two teams matched up against one another in the same venue on the same Saturday before Harvard’s winter semester began. And then too, Harvard faced an unexpected deficit in the waning moments of the contest: it was down 10 with less than two minutes to play. But thanks to three clutch threes from then-co-captain Christian Webster and two layups from Chambers, Harvard was able to climb back into the game, force overtime, and ultimately earn the win.
“We were able to steal [that one],” Amaker recalled.
So, late in Saturday’s contest, when the Crimson found itself down 10 to Dartmouth once more and Chambers took the ball coast-to-coast, slicing with ease into the heart of the Big Green defense to score the layup, it seemed as if—maybe, just maybe—history would repeat itself, and Harvard would once again claw its way to the top of the scoreboard.
But Webster wasn’t on the court this time. He was on the bench, as an assistant coach, and Harvard managed to put in only two of the four three-pointers it attempted in the final minutes of play.
So just as Harvard’s 11-game winning streak against Dartmouth came to an end on Saturday afternoon, so, too, did the feeling of déjà vu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard men’s fencing team could not find a way to stave off its second defeat at the hands of Penn State for the second time this season to start off the St. John’s Invitational, the group won out the rest of the day to take the tournament in a tiebreaker.
“The team came out with so much energy—we wanted to prepare for [Ivy matches] to make sure that we were ready for that environment,” junior foilist Michael Woo said. “All of us were in our most intense mode...and the freshmen [who] haven’t had much college fencing really stepped up today.”
After beginning their day with tie against host St. John’s, the Crimson women had a tougher afternoon, finishing with a 1-3-1 record despite 12 individual bout wins from senior épéeist Emma Vaggo and sophomore sabré fencer Adrienne Jarocki.
HARVARD MEN’S FENCING
0-10 stood the group’s all-time record against Notre Dame before Saturday, a matchup that has vexed Harvard coach Peter Brand’s teams for years.
And like last season’s 14-13 loss at the hands of the Fighting Irish, the outcome came down to the wire. But thanks to stellar performances from freshman foilist Eli Dershwitz and others, the match ended with the Crimson (7-2) putting an end to Notre Dame’s historic dominance.
“Eli is an amazing competitor, [and] I’ve never seen a freshman come in here with [his] kind of work ethic,” Woo said. “He actually started off pretty rough today...but he responded well by going 8-0 in his next bouts and finishing the day strong.”
Another strong Brand recruit, Dershwitz, who earned gold at the Budapest Junior World Cup last year, has notched 23 bout wins against just four defeats thus far in his first season with Harvard.
Three of those first to five touch losses came against Penn State, which was the only team to defeat Harvard as a team on Saturday.
“I started slowly…[and] the whole team was counting on each other, so I tried my best to forget about it,” Dershwitz said.
Despite sharing a 4-1 record with the Nittany Lions and the Fighting Irish, the Crimson was awarded the invitational win as the team with the most total bout wins for the day.
“Even in the bouts where we were losing, we still fought...push[ing] each other the whole day,” Dershwitz added.
11 bout wins from the Sherborn, Mass. native was only enough to propel the sabré fencers to a 2-3 match record on the day. It was the foil contingent Woo, junior Jerry Chang, and sophomore Stephen Mageras who carried the team with a collective 5-0 match record, with each of the three finishing with 10 bout victories apiece.
“We tried to make [the non-Ivy matchups] as serious as possible and treat it like the real thing,” Woo said. “So I think the mentality [was] different today.”
Sophomore épéeist Alexander Eldeib also had 10 bout victories to make it five Crimson men with double-digit wins on Saturday.
HARVARD WOMEN’S FENCING
Outside of the sabré trio’s 4-0-1 match record—upping the weapon’s mark to 10-0-1 for the year—the Harvard women had a tough time finding the few extra individual bout wins necessary to notch team wins. With the competition much stronger than fencers the Crimson faced at the Tradition Tournament in early December, Harvard came away with its first three losses of the season.
The major bright spot of the day came with the Crimson’s second victory over Penn State this season—though it was a 14-13 nailbiter rather than the 21-6 rout of the Nittany Lions in December.
“For me [as] a freshman, it’s still pretty nerve-wrecking going into [the tournament],” said épéeist Claire Dinhut. “But [it] being the second time we faced Penn State also, we had more confidence, since we had done well against them last time.”
With the Ivy League Round Robins in two weeks, the Crimson women will have to put the losses of 16-11, 15-12, and 16-11 to Columbia, Notre Dame, and Ohio State, respectively, behind them. If the past is any indication, Harvard finished 2-3 at last year’s closely contested St. John’s Invitational and then went on to a second place finish at the round robins.

Harvard scored some major pop culture points this Wednesday when comedian Kathy Griffin was spotted hiking in Hollywood while rocking a Harvard t-shirt. Though we at Flyby don’t fully understand how it’s possible to hike in Hollywood, we’re still jazzed that the current host of E! network’s “fashion police” would even consider wearing a Harvard shirt while accomplishing this.
Perhaps more impressive than Griffin’s matching “plum red” lipstick is the fact that she didn’t even have to buy the shirt. Harvard University, and the reigning world’s chillest former interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, presented it to her back in 2013 in recognition for her work with veterans.
Although Griffin never went to college, instead choosing to study comedy with a troupe in L.A., she hasn’t been held back by her lack of a formal degree. From writing a best-selling novel to dating Apple co-founder Steve Wozniack, she’s done things Harvard students can only dream of.

Thanks to fundraising efforts by photojournalism blog Humans of New York (HONY), the class of one Brooklyn middle school is set to tour Harvard– and for years to come. Along with HONY creator Brandon Stanton, educators from Mott Bridges Hall Academy in Brooklyn raised enough money to integrate a Harvard trip into the school’s curriculum.
For those of you who’ve yet to experience the ultimate form of procrastination that is scrolling through dozens of HONY’s touching pictures, Humans of New York is a popular (and we mean over 11 million likes on Facebook) blog that posts portrait shots of New Yorkers, complete with a short interview.
It’s a heart-warming story that began when Stanton posted a photo of a boy from MBHA last Monday. The unnamed boy credited his principal as his biggest influence, specifically recalling a time when “she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of [them] that [they] matter[ed]." The post exploded on the internet– even Harvard’s own Facebook page liked it!
But the story didn’t stop there. Stanton tracked down the principal, whose full name is Nadia L. Lopez, and visited the school, located in Brownsville, Brooklyn, a neighborhood with the highest crime rate within New York City according to Stanton. There, Lopez, Stanton and another teacher conceived of the idea to create a fund that would provide each incoming 6th grade class a chance to visit a “new place,” which, it was decided, would be Harvard.
“I want every child who enters my school to know that they can go anywhere, and that they will belong,” said Lopez in her interview with Stanton.
Though the original goal was to raise $100,000, the fundraiser has already received almost $500,000, which Lopez hopes to use for an educational and safe summer program for her students.
And to make things even better, Stanton himself is visiting Harvard in February! Who doesn’t want to revel in all of his artistic and philanthropic glory in person?
