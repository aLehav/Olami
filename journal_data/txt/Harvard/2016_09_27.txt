With “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation,” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” under his belt, it seemed that writer and sitcom creator Michael Schur could do no wrong. Now, Schur attempts to add to his illustrious track record with “The Good Place,” an NBC sitcom whose premise of life after death is perhaps harder to translate to the sitcom structure than his other TV successes. But while “The Good Place” does indeed get bogged down in trying to maintain a recognizable format, there are still frequent moments of high-spirited whimsy that lighten the subject matter and convey an infectious sense of fun.
Here’s the basic idea: Eleanor, played by Kristen Bell, has died and been chosen by Michael, a cosmic city planner played by legendary sitcom star Ted Danson, to become a part of his select afterlife community, a picturesque neighborhood filled with spacious gardens and immaculate pastel décor. She meets her appointed “soul mate,” a likable Senegalese ethics professor named Chidi, played by William Jackson Harper, and attempts to settle into the idyllic community. But here’s the problem: Eleanor has been mistaken for someone else—she’s actually a horrible person who has the potential to quite literally destroy the Good Place at its core. With Chidi’s help, Eleanor must learn to coexist in a society replete with an almost nauseating amount of virtue and selflessness.
These first episodes (written by Schur and Alan Yang of “Master of None” fame) clearly have a lot of exposition to get out of the way. Although the velocity of jokes remains high, it’s obvious that the show is sticking to typical sitcom dialogue and plot, with Eleanor and Chidi often trading inane banter about moral redemption and getting into rather predictable misunderstandings. A few laughs scattered throughout the hour fall flat; the show relies too much on pop culture references and surface-level characterization (Tahani, an antagonist, is simply a haughty upper-class stereotype, and Danson’s character is given far too many fish-out-of-water jokes as an omnipotent being in a human body). Over-the-top flashbacks depicting the depravity of Eleanor’s past life and several other recurring jokes yield quickly diminishing returns.
That said, the jokes that land really work. When the show briefly contemplates the unspeakable horror of the Bad Place below (which the Good Place residents cheerfully gloss over in their daily lives), Schur introduces a gleefully dark sense of humor to his pastel world, promising a bit more edge than what the traditional network show might offer. Fascinatingly odd and cartoonish sight gags (although some are hindered by the rather unrealistic effects) are also littered throughout, and the genuine chemistry between Eleanor and Chidi shines through most of the show’s pitfalls.
It’s evident that the high-concept nature of the show allows a lot of opportunity for worldbuilding, which provides many of the more colorful jokes. The show also holds a mirror to contemporary society in rather subtle ways, as everything from casual remarks on the ubiquity of frozen yogurt to Tahani’s narcissistic behavior seems like passing jabs at us as a whole. The show is relatively uninterested in the critiques of religion that one might expect from its premise; its preferred target seems to be the hollow altruism and narcissism of today. If “The Good Place” continues to dig into this treasure trove of material over the course of the season, the show promises to be not a forgettable diversion but instead a thoughtful, whimsical journey toward moral virtue and inner fulfillment that can’t fail to leave a grin on your face.

“We have a Housing and Urban Development secretary running the free world.”
Big deal, one might think. Stranger things happen weekly in this election cycle. Even Kevin Spacey recently admitted that reality has caught up with the once unthinkable plots of “House of Cards.” In terms of political antics, the bizarre nature of 2016 makes it difficult for any fictional commentary to remain compelling. Regardless, ABC’s new series “Designated Survivor” manages to stay original through its consideration of the different facets of Washington life, tastefully blending elements of national security, personal conflict, and power struggle into a promising new type of White House drama.
The pilot depicts the rapid transition of a quiet government official from fading Cabinet secretary to commander-in-chief—so rapid, in fact, that  it occurs in half a day. The title of the series alludes to a contingency for utter carnage: One member of the presidential line of succession, the “designated survivor,” is chosen yearly to sit out the State of the Union address at an undisclosed location. “The West Wing” briefly explored this role [sixteen][16] years ago, placing a Secretary of Agriculture on standby to take the presidential oath. This time, protagonist Tom Kirkman (portrayed by Kiefer Sutherland) heads an agency even lower on the so-called food chain, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a position mocked by another character as a “glorified real estate agent.” Regardless, the Capitol explodes during the address, and Kirkman soon ends up in the presidential chair.
This episode is ultimately defined not by conventional politics but rather by the logistical and personal strain caused by a sudden transition of power. Secretary Kirkman begins his dynamic day with a visit to the Oval Office for a reason converse to his eventual destiny: his unexpected firing by the president’s chief of staff. Due to his public differences of policy with the rest of the administration, he will soon be replaced as HUD Secretary in order to bolster the president’s second-term agenda (and he will thus have no reason to attend the president’s speech that night). It remains to be seen whether Kirkman suffers from survivor’s guilt or imposter syndrome as he struggles to run the administration that was about to dismiss him, and whether news of his dismissal will be made public and plague his mandate. White House staffers already doubt their new boss for his inexperience, and an ambitious general is conspiring against him. Furthermore, Kirkman has many family concerns that make him hesitant about moving into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He is a father of two (including a teenage son who deals drugs), and while his children have never been targets, they are now at tremendous risk.
Another refreshing aspect of “Designated Survivor” is its impressively current timeline. A significant portion of the pilot—and likely of the season altogether—deals with the analysis of the explosion by a counterterrorism expert in the FBI, Hannah Wells. Having been present during the bombings in Paris and Brussels, she has tracked the social media activity of terrorist groups enough to notice patterns. When no terrorist group or enemy state takes ownership of the D.C. attack, she predicts future attacks to come. Her investigative role is enthralling so far, yet largely undefined. Additionally, while no foreign government demonstrates support of the bombing, Iran exploits potential American weakness by sending large ships into the Strait of Hormuz, giving the new president a foreign policy crisis in his first few hours. The combination of the enigmatic Wells subplot and the show’s overall reaction to cyclical global affairs will be an intriguing counterbalance to the more linear Kirkman story.
It is inevitable that “Designated Survivor” will be compared to peer dramas about the American presidency. It is less buoyant than “The West Wing” but less cynical than “House of Cards” (although the Capitol eruption tops anything that the Netflix flagship has done in terms of improbability). Its characters are more competent than those of “Veep” or “Parks and Recreation,” even when less experienced, yet demonstrably less teflon than those of ABC’s current top political show, “Scandal.” Nonetheless, the young series benefits from the ability to cherry-pick the successful ingredients of its acclaimed predecessors. Allegorically, “Designated Survivor” is crafting its own narrative for the presidency, one of great nuance and little cliché. It will be worth watching over the coming months, especially after November 8.

In 1892, after reading a fairytale about devilish wintry sprite Jack Frost, an 11-year-old girl wrote a short story called “The Frost King.” Upon its publication in the Perkins School for the Blind’s literary magazine, the story was reported to the school’s head. Not long after, the young girl—who happened to be future author and activist Helen Keller—was accused of lifting her story straight from Margaret Canby’s “Frost Fairies.” Luckily, tween Keller was eventually acquitted of the charges.
We are taught from an early age that plagiarism is practically a capital offense, punishable by a zero on an assignment, expulsion from school, and so forth. Today’s world of copyright infringement and copy-paste mentality drills it into our heads that copying is wrong. Instead, postmodern culture praises the values of authenticity and originality. Innovation and creation require us to be authentic, to be fresh, to come up with ideas no one else has yet considered. These are the new principles that society values and encourages. If copying another person is not outright illegal, it is at the very least disappointing.
Ten years after the Frost King incident, author Mark Twain expressed his frustration about how it was handled in a letter to Keller: “The kernel, the soul—let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterance—is plagiarism. For substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources…”
Ideas, much like the ocean’s fish supply back at the height of the fishing industry, appear to be limitless. They are abstractions of the mind, neural firings of an inconceivably complex brain. Approximating the number of potential ideas feels comparable to approximating the number of stars in the universe: impossible. Our gut reaction is to push back against Twain’s suggestion that the pool of ideas might be finite. It’s alarming to consider that Twain could be right, that we are in fact doomed to echo our predecessors without any new words to offer. If so compelled, one could even take it a step further into the realm of existentialism: How can we justify our individual existence if we are only mimicking lives that have passed by before us
Ralph Waldo Emerson, after reaching a similar conclusion to Twain’s, took comfort in the fact that originality may have never really existed anyway, saying: “The originals are not original. There is imitation, model, and suggestion, to the very archangels, if we knew their history.”
What is not innate must be learned, and humans learn best through imitation. It’s a smart way of doing things: Leonardo touched a stove and burned his hand? Don’t do as Leonardo does. Leonardo created a mind-blowing painting that has been studied and lauded by art experts around the world for centuries? Do as Leonardo does. In its most innocent form, copying is a compliment. Imitation stems from inspiration—we copy what we like. As such, imitation has worked its way into every facet of our lives, whether it be the visual arts, films, novels, poetry, music, fashion trends, consumer products or even our conversations with other people: Studies show that we tend to imitate the person who we are speaking with in order to make the interaction more comfortable. When we are born, our brains are stuffed with mirror neurons in order to make living life a little easier. Do as others do. Don’t touch the stove. Paint the Mona Lisa.
And the appropriation marches on. A surprising number (or perhaps not?) of the last century’s brightest and freshest minds have been found guilty at some point or another. T.S. Eliot, renowned poet and Nobel Prize winner, was accused of creating a potpourri of other people’s texts and rebranding it as the famous poem “The Waste Land.” In June, rock legend Led Zeppelin was declared not guilty after allegedly stealing the opening of hit “Stairway to Heaven” from an instrumental song by singer Randy Wolfe. And this past July, even the scintillatingly original Melania Trump fell into the hole of plagiarism when her convention speech bore striking resemblances to Michelle Obama’s 2008 version. Not to mention the possible sharing of ideas within the Gospels, with Mark borrowing from Matthew, or Luke borrowing from Mark. The question then becomes—would we be better off in a plagiarism-free world if it meant the loss of these iconic pieces? In the majority of these cases, probably not.

Some might say that jazz and country music belong on different continents. Yet at the opening night of his alma mater’s annual Berklee Beantown Jazz Festival, John Scofield demonstrated that each genre is merely an island in a musician’s pond and that bridges can be built to connect them. From the abstract unaccompanied guitar to the organ chords over syncopated drumming and the jazzier solos, the inherent nuance of the 10-song set list kept the spectators lively and won Scofield a standing ovation.
Scofield released his new album, “Country for Old Men,” on the day of the concert to high expectations: His previous record, “Past Present,” won the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and was nominated for another award. Nevertheless, there was no evident pressure in the room as Scofield and his bandmates—drummer Bill Stewart, bassist Steve Swallow, and pianist and organist Larry Goldings—masterfully captured the calming spirit of country balladry and the vivid energy of western rock and roll.
One of the early highlights of the concert was the folk song “Red River Valley,” which Scofield introduced as something he doubted was sung in school music classes anymore (“Oh, they don't have music in school!” he followed, to hefty audience laughter). Beginning with Goldings boldly playing the famed melody on organ at an upbeat tempo, the song soon broke to a quiet swing for a calm guitar solo. This section lasted for a few minutes, with Scofield tinkering with various scales and descending diminished chords (in contrast to the basic major progression of the intro), and was followed by shorter solos by Goldings, Swallow, and Scofield again. After a few bars of Stewart’s drumming, the jarring shift occurred again—the fast organ melody was recapitulated to the end of the song. This number seemed, in a sense, allegorical for the entire concept: highly experimental and intriguing, yet simultaneously familiar and crowd-pleasing—a juxtaposition that elicited much surprise and many smiles.
From the mysterious “Jolene” to the ebullient “Wildwood Flower,” the rest of the country-jazz program was varied and unpredictable. Perhaps the most unconventional song was the rendition of “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” by Hank Williams, played under purple lights to octatonic guitar scales and a rapid 4/4 construction. The original, for comparison, was a major-key, downtempo waltz. Larry Goldings took a more prominent role during the second piece of the night, Merle Haggard’s “Mama Tried,” in which he had an extensive and highly technical piano solo. The slowest song of the night came at one of its most beautiful moments: the encore. After introducing “Just a Girl I Used to Know,” a George Jones classic, Scofield read the lyrics of the first verse aloud: “There’s a picture that I carry / One we made some time ago / If they ask who’s in the picture with me / I say just a girl I used to know.”

Can you be friends with a computer? This is one of the questions you are asked to answer with “Event[0],” the first game developed by Paris-based studio Ocelot Society. It is, without a doubt, one of the most uniquely styled games I’ve played in a long time. The conceit: You are an astronaut for a private company, one of the privileged few. Your ship, for some mysterious reason, breaks apart after it reaches Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons. You plummet towards a defunct, long-abandoned ship still in orbit around the moon. As you make various narrative decisions about who you are and why you’re currently hurtling through space, a hauntingly beautiful smoky jazz piece plays over the speakers, accompanied by a variety of high-quality sound effects to go along with your decisions. Once you’re on the ship, you begin your game-long conversation with Kaizen, the ship’s onboard AI, which might not be as helpful as it seems at first.
I was instantly impressed by how quickly this sequence draws you into the game world. It only lasts for a few minutes, but by the time it was over I was entirely ready to move forward with “Event[0]”. At first, chatting with Kaizen is a novel bit of fun. You walk up to a console—I quickly altered my control scheme to use the more standard WASD movement, rather than holding down the left mouse button to move forward. The idea behind the design decision is that the player can walk right up to terminals and engage them right away, but I found it too hard to adjust and changed to a more vanilla movement scheme. Maybe next time, Ocelot Society.
But as is the nature with just about any chatbot, you quickly realize that that’s all Kaizen is: a (not particularly clever, to be honest) chatbot. You can’t say anything too complicated, or not complicated enough, or else it starts to spit out the chatbot’s last resort of random catch-all phrases. At times when all you want is a nudge in the correct direction or for a door to open, Kaizen is just as frustrating as the infamous Word help paperclip; periodically offering assistance without really being all that helpful.
The game consists mostly of opening and closing doors through the console and combing through rooms or information logs looking to unravel the mystery of the ship. There’s even a really cool couple of sequences spent flying around outside the ship. The game on average, though, seems to lack direction. I spent 20 minutes going in and out of the ship, trying to figure out what to do, before I asked Kaizen for help. After 10 unhelpful minutes of conversation, I had no choice but to commit a cardinal sin of gaming: I looked up a walkthrough.
This is a red flag in game design. If a reasonably competent player cannot understand from either context clues or overt instruction what his or her next move might be, there is a problem. I’m not saying the game should have waypoints or objective markers, but it would be nice to have some way for completely lost players to reorient themselves. For example, at one point Kaizen wouldn’t let me leave the ship because it was worried it would lose its new friend. At first I was touched and interested that the game had taken this step; 10 minutes of fruitlessly trying to get the damn robot to let me out quickly disabused me of this notion. I would have loved a little hint about halfway into the experience. Instead I turned to my good friend Google once more.
It’s really too bad that the game doesn’t have this feature, because other than these snags the game is a great time. The visuals are breathtaking, especially for an indie studio’s first game; every room is highly detailed and well-textured. Much of the strength of the experience comes out of that visual detail, the way each room tells a story with magazines and reactive storage compartments and all the trappings of retro-futuristic space life.
In fact, “Event[0]” is absolutely replete with graphic detail. “Metropolis,” an old German science fiction film imagining workers as machinery plays on a projector screen in the living room, offering a nod to predecessors and reinforcing the game’s thematic material at once; there’s a piano in the same room that plays itself until the player takes over; and as the game progresses, equations and scientific mumbo jumbo are graffitied on the walls. There was clearly a huge amount of thought and care put into making each room feel like it belongs in the game world.
The game itself is very short: Even with my half-hour of confusion, I finished the entire piece in just over two hours. The puzzles it presents are fun but relatively easy to solve, and despite Kaizen’s sometimes obstinately unhelpful logic, the overall experience is pretty smooth. There are some technical issues—the game ran dangerously hot on my rig and crashed a few times while I was alt-tabbing—and “Event[0]” is not a game that really offers a lot of replay value. If you’re looking for something to sink hours into, this is not it. But if you’re looking for a highly polished (if somewhat experimental) hand-crafted short narrative experience, then you can do much, much worse than “Event[0].”
“Event[0]” can be purchased on Steam, GOG.com, the Humble Store, Itch.io, or from the developers directly at event0game.com for $19.99.

I must have walked by Widener hundreds of times without giving it a second glance. Then one morning, as I made my way to an unfortunately early class, the capital of one of the library’s columns caught my eye. The next day, I stopped to look. At this point, I’ve spent quite some time staring at the capital, as I’ve tried to understand its details and translate them to a graphite sketch. Its intricacy is astounding. The capital, just one tiny detail on the enormous structure that is Widener Library, stands on its own as an impressive piece of art.
Widener is, however, more than the overall structure, and more even than the minute details. Every building has a purpose and a relationship with the people that walk its halls. For many structures, that purpose is not immediately evident or observable. With Widener, one begins to see that relationship even before setting foot inside the building. Students spill out of the building, sitting, studying and reading on its steps, in proximity to the great library but not hidden from the bustling Harvard Yard. In this way, the world of books and records that is Widener Library and the living, breathing world of the students who browse its shelves  blur together.

On Saturday, the Boston Symphony Orchestra opened their 136th season with a brilliant program of Russian pieces and a performance by Lang Lang, one of the world’s most famous pianists. Both Lang and the orchestra, conducted by BSO music director Andris Nelsons, received multiple standing ovations from the full concert hall, this weekend unusually festive with patrons in black tie and evening dress.
At first, Lang’s piece, Sergei Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 3, seemed an odd choice for a pianist known for his expressive, even excessively performative, playing style. By turns lyrical and playful, the 1921 piece demands a certain crispness and exactitude from the pianist. Prokofiev leaves no room for grandstanding, and though technically demanding, the piece lacks the kind of drama that Lang Lang often brings to his playing.  Throughout the first movement, Lang Lang’s gestural playing seemed slightly out of step with the tone of the piece, but by the beginning of the gorgeous second movement with its twisting variations, he had settled into the piece perfectly. From the haunting first notes on the clarinet, the orchestra performed brilliantly: At times, their playing was so effortless that the music itself seemed to carry the musicians along, rushing them headlong through the whirling figures. Lang Lang received several calls back to the stage and performed as an encore Mexican composer Manuel Ponce’s Intermezzo No. 1, a meditative piece that revealed a more emotional and impressionistic side of his playing.
The BSO began the night with Dmitri Shostakovich’s Festive Overture, a short but rousing work that displays the optimistic side of a composer known for his more somber music. The piece was finished in 1954, when the composer’s life had improved dramatically with the death of Stalin and the lessening of the threat of persecution that had hung over many Soviet artists and writers for decades. Quick-paced and exuberant, the piece deploys a double brass ensemble—six trumpets, six trombones, and eight horns, some of which were placed directly behind the audience in the second balcony—to deliver a heroic climax, which the BSO rendered in all its slightly overblown yet still lovable glory.

High fashion borders on the wack, it’s true. Just when you think you’ve seen it all—from terrifyingly foot-contorting “Armadillo” shoes to models strutting down the runway wearing other models as backpacks to soft tufts of fur used as nail polish—someone, namely Tom Ford, steps in and slaps you in the face with the family jewels. And no, that’s not a figure of speech.
Sure, a gold-plated penis necklace isn’t everyone’s preferred form of aesthetic expression. Like any great work of art, Tom Ford’s phallus-shaped pendant has simultaneously fanned the flames of controversy and adoration. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights allegedly protested the necklace on the grounds that it too closely resembles a crucifix, but this simply adds to its artistic charm. Theories abound that the resemblance is not merely an accident but rather a pointed allusion to similarly phallic Roman “fascinus” charms, the wearing of which is a practice that originated in the Church itself. Also, like a good modernist painting, Ford’s necklace leaves room for interpretation while still acknowledging the diversity of its audience. In sizing—a sensitive topic for many—Ford’s design team has taken care to include a comprehensive array of sizes for the sensitive male ego: small, medium, and large. 
Need more convincing? Look no further than your sartorial experts—the necklace has its fair share of fashion-world admirers. High-powered fashion blogger Bryanboy, for instance, just about sums it up in his stirring critique (circa 2014):
“It’s shiny.
It’s gold. (ok, fine, if you want to be technical, it’s gold-plated brass)
It’s a piece of jewelry.
It’s a penis.
It’s Tom Ford.
Best Christmas present to self EVER!!!”
Pure art is priceless. Consider yourself lucky, then, to have this penis pendant at your purchasing disposal for the low price of $800.

Lance I. Oppenheim ’19 gained national attention this fall with his documentary “Long Term Parking,” which was published on The New York Times’ website. The short film follows flight attendants, pilots, and mechanics who have taken up residence in an unofficial trailer park in a lot behind the Los Angeles International Airport. Oppenheim, an active multimedia editor, discussed his inspiration for this documentary, as well as the ethical issues that come with representing such an intimate topic.

The Harvard Crimson: How did you come up with the idea for this documentary?
Lance I. Oppenheim: Last January, I received a grant from Harvard to make a film about a parking lot in LAX, where pilots, flight attendants, and mechanics have been living for the past ten years. The first time I saw the park, I was trying to get to LAX faster and took a different route, and I thought, “What the hell is that?” I never really thought about it until I left LAX. Ever since the recession, I had been thinking of how the idea of home ownership faded into obscurity, and when I traveled I also saw that what might be a home in other countries may not be considered a home here in the U.S. From that, I got the idea of making a bunch of little vignettes about this transient, non-permanent, non-traditional idea of home.
THC: Even though these are non-traditional homes, they are still really private. How did you get the residents to open up to you?
LIO: I started doing research about this parking lot, but I wasn’t really sure it still existed, and the airport was obviously very tight-lipped. So I bought a flight and a hotel for the night, and I rolled my luggage to the lot and literally just started knocking on people’s doors. I talked to a lot of people, and the three people in the film were actually the only three that I was able to interview with a camera, but there were dozens I interviewed without one. I wasn't there for very long, which is a testament to the kind of condition these residents are in. A lot of them are lonely, and some of them like that loneliness, but they don’t really have people peering in, curious about how their lives are like on a daily basis. I think that was one of the reasons why most let me in; it was because I was very interested in what they were doing and why they were doing it.
Even though life hasn’t been totally great for these residents, they have somehow found a way to be happy and be free. Some people in the film are just trying to convince themselves that they are happy with where they are, but other ones have managed to find a sort of freedom in the deep, deep abyss that they’ve sunk into. I went into this thinking I would find some kind of quirky story, and I came out of it finding something way more melancholic than the people that were involved in the documentary could have imagined.
THC: One of the main themes of your film is the thwarted American dream, as well as the romantic idea of loneliness and self-sufficiency taken to the extreme. How did you manage to tease these themes out during the film, and what were some others that stood out to you?
LIO: I’m a big fan of narrative movies, and I just wanted to tell their stories in the way they were presented to me, in as unvarnished a way as possible. The central theme of the film is about the idea of home. Here are these residents, and the things and people and places they associate with home have not been in their lives for years. What makes the film interesting is that we get to see how these people carry on despite all this. Amy, one of the flight attendants, has a harmonium, and she plays it to quiet down the noise of planes and the emptiness of her trailer. She almost craves the loneliness, because she’s constantly in the air, 24/7. Amy told me that serving people on a metal tube is more lonely than being alone in her trailer.
Another undertone in this film is the idea of a service industry. I think most people who fly just don’t pay attention to flight attendants, to the people who have these pasted-on smiles that they have to give everyone, and if they don’t do one thing right then you will have a negative experience. If your TV isn't working, then you blame it on them; if anything goes wrong, you blame it on them; and then where do they go afterwards?
THC: One of the things this film portrayed very well is how deceptive appearances can be. These people look like average, middle-class Americans, but behind this financial front is the crushing reality that they cannot afford even the basics of the American dream. How does it feel to puncture through that in your film?
LIO: It's really interesting to put it that way, and many of the people in this film do put up that façade, especially when there is a camera involved. They’re treating me to some degree like how they would treat people on one of their flights. They desperately want to please me, but I don’t think any of them ever really got comfortable with my presence, which is why I think they act the way they do in the film. Because of this experience, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to make people’s lives into a film.

Scott Rothkopf ’99, chief curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, began his career in art history at Harvard, where he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees, curated exhibitions at the Harvard Art Museums, and wrote art criticism for the The Crimson. Since joining the Whitney in 2009, Rothkopf has organized exhibitions of the work of Mary Heilmann, Jeff Koons, Wade Guyton, Glenn Ligon, and others. James Cuno, former director of the Harvard Art Museums and now president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, has called him “the leading contemporary art curator of his generation.” Last week, Rothkopf talked to The Crimson about his student days, his passion for art and museums, and his current work at the Whitney.

The Harvard Crimson: How did you come to be where you are? What drew you to art history?
Scott Rothkopf: I was always drawn to art, since I was a little boy. That began with a fixation on the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, when I was probably nine or ten years old. Later my interest migrated more toward visual art: painting, sculpture, photography. But it’s been a lifelong passion of mine. I think it wasn’t until I showed up at college that I understood that this was actually a discipline that you could study. Although I knew a little bit about art history, it was my freshman year [of] taking classes in the art history department, that was really an earth-shattering revelation to me. I was exposed to so many kinds of artists and so many new ideas about art. So I give Harvard a lot of credit in helping to turn me into an art historian at that stage.
THC: And how did you decide that museum work was where you wanted to take that interest?
SR: One of the things that was most exciting about studying art history at Harvard was being around so many great works of art at the Fogg and having access to so much curatorial expertise. I very soon fell in love with the idea of museum work. I didn’t know exactly what that meant, and at times I also considered becoming a professor. But in graduate school I really expected that I would become a curator, and it was actually something of a surprise to myself that my first job out of school was as a senior editor at “Artforum” magazine, where I had been writing reviews. I ended up spending six years on the editorial side, at an art publication, before transitioning back to museum work at the Whitney.
THC: What do you find so compelling about museum work and museum spaces?
SR: One of the reasons I like working in museums is that I love being around art objects, as corny as that sounds. I don’t have the financial resources to live with them in my daily life, so this job gives me proximity to all of these things that give me great pleasure, that challenge me, that inspire me. And I love sharing that with our audiences. And I use that word audiences in the plural, to indicate that I’m aware that many different kinds of people come to the Whitney, whether as schoolchildren or artists or tourists from abroad. I could work in a gallery or an auction house, and I understand those roles too. But for me museum work has a missionary quality, to the extent that I’m doing a public service in bringing these works to the attention of the public, sharing them with people who, like me, couldn’t otherwise afford them, and caring for them for future generations.
THC: When you’re curating an exhibition, what do you think really makes an exhibition space work?
SR: There are a lot of different factors and different kinds of exhibitions. For me, one component of all of shows that I do is really thinking about the sense of experience that a person has in the galleries. Often a mistake that people who are art historians make when they come into curating is just to think about these works as elements in an argument that could happen outside of time and space. What’s unique about the museum experience, what’s different from the space of art criticism or from writing a book, is that you’re actually encountering this narrative in the physical setting. I want people when they move through my exhibitions to have a real sense of surprise, maybe a sense of drama, maybe a sense of quiet, or a moment when they’re challenged. They can feel things at all different emotional and perceptual pitches. I think a lot about architecture and space when I bring works of art together and about how these objects speak to one another. I also like to think about storytelling in my shows, such that there is a quality when you walk into a gallery that you can intuit instantly, without having to read the labels on the walls. You can just see this conversation among the works happening all around you.
THC: I saw in our archives that you wrote for The Crimson while at Harvard, and in a 1997 review of the Whitney Biennial, you wrote, “It may be impossible to [put a finger on] the zeitgeist of contemporary art, but lucky for us the Whitney Museum would rather die than give up trying.” Now that you’re at the Whitney Museum, how would you answer the question of who are some of the artists responding to the contemporary situation, whatever that may be, in compelling ways?
SR [laughs]: I feel so old, having you read that back to me! Thankfully, I’m not curating the Whitney Biennial, although I am leading the advisory team, so I don’t have to be the one to define the zeitgeist for the museum in that way. There are so many great talents who are emerging right now or are due for recognition at mid-career. We’ve had an amazing time with our emerging artist series showcasing artists like Rachel Rose and Jared Madere and Njideka Crosby. These may not be artists who are well-known to your readers, but they have helped ignite our emerging artist program. I’m working on a show right now with an artist called Laura Owens, who’s in her forties, for a “mid-career” survey of her work from the last twenty years. When I go to younger artists’ studios, artists who are in their twenties and thirties, I often ask them who are artists older than them who they are looking at. Laura was someone who kept coming up in conversations with artists who are ten to twenty years younger than her. Sometimes you’re guided toward exhibition ideas by the arts community itself, and I always find that an interesting way to land on people.
THC: Could you speak more about that, about the relationship between a museum of contemporary art and living artists?
SR: It varies from museum to museum, but the Whitney has always had a very close relationship with living artists. It was founded by an artist: Our founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, in addition to being an heiress, was also a sculptor. She founded the museum at a time when American artists were stuck between two problematic categories: On the one hand, compared to the European avant-garde in the early twentieth century they were rather conservative, but on the other hand, those artists who were trying new things in their work were disparaged by the more academic art community in New York. This museum since its founding had always had a commitment to showing and buying the work of living artists. It’s great to work in a place that takes that mission so seriously, that can be a space for debate, that often shows work before it’s been proven, and that brings to the public’s attention the work of younger artists or even older artists who didn’t get the recognition they deserve.
THC: Do you see a divide between art history as it’s taught and studied in universities and art history as it’s practiced in museums?
SR: I think that divide is actually a little less than it was twenty years ago. When I was in school in the nineties and early two thousands, there was, I think, a greater mistrust between museums and art history departments in general. This had come out of the debates of the sixties, seventies, and eighties, in which the academy really sought to critique the normative standards of museums as institutions that constructed meaning. There were canons being deconstructed and narratives being dismantled, and I think there was a sense of antagonism there that had emerged by the time I was in grad school and college. Now, I think, you find many museums opening themselves from within, and you find many museums courting curators who are well-trained in the very academic discourse that might [formerly] have threatened their existence. And I think you have many art history departments turning to thinking about the value of studying objects closely, the value of sending their students off to work in institutions like the Whitney as opposed to just the academy. I’m hopeful that there is a rapprochement that will grow stronger still.
THC: There’s also been a strong tradition of institutional critique, of deconstructing museums as institutions, in contemporary art for the last several decades. Have those ideas coming out of artists’ practices influenced the way curators and museum professionals are thinking about how to present work now?
SR: Oh, absolutely. First of all, the Whitney has a history of showing many of those artists. Hans Haacke is in our collection, and we recently invited Andrea Fraser to do a project at the museum. Michael Asher, before he died, won [the Whitney Museum’s] Bucksbaum prize. So we’ve embraced those artists and given them opportunities to show, but the way that our programs have been changed through those conversations has to do with making more manifest some of our funding structures, and I would say with dismantling or at least reconsidering some of the core narratives of American art. When you look at the opening exhibition at this museum, we tried to highlight many under-known figures. We were trying to be the most diverse that we could be in terms of artists, in terms of race and ethnicity, and in terms of including more women than had ever been the case. We also worked hard to combine mediums, not to insist on a hierarchy of painting and sculpture over prints or photography. We’ve also tried to integrate ephemeral and time-sensitive performance work into our exhibition program. These are all things that many of the artists who are engaged in institutional critique helped to call for. Interestingly, the project that Andrea Fraser participated in was called “Open Plan,” and that was a project where we gave five different artists essentially the entire fifth floor of the museum to use as they wished. That spirit of the curator stepping aside and the institution laying itself open to this kind of inquiry is, I think, one of the many legacies of institutional critique.
THC: Is there anything else you would like to add?
SR: I would just say, since the article is appearing in The Crimson, that really one of my most formative experiences in thinking about art was as an art critic at The Crimson. It was the first place where I felt like I had a forum for expressing my ideas and felt something like a grownup when it came to thinking about art or participating in the art world. This was in the late nineties before blogs and online publishing platforms were as common as they are today, and The Crimson gave me a real sense of responsibility, a sense of reaching audiences, and a place to cut my teeth. To this day I think that the experience of learning how to write there—and of convincing my sometimes skeptical editors that a show like the Whitney Biennial was worth covering in a student newspaper in Cambridge—was a great learning experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven-year old Anna O’Donnell is a living miracle: She has not had anything to eat for four months. If this seems impossible, it is because it is actually impossible. Lib Wright—the protagonist and a nurse—sets out to prove this by taking up a job in the “dead centre” of Ireland. However, all of her expectations are shattered after she gets to know Anna. She realizes, “‘This fast, it’s Anna’s rock. Her daily task, her vocation.’”  Everything else is likewise not as simple as it seems, and the book ultimately shapes up to be a shocking and suspenseful piece of work. With its well-drawn characters, unusual setting, and fluid plot, “The Wonder” shines.
Emma Donoghue, author of the international best-seller “Room,” flawlessly portrays her characters, as well as the emotional relationship between nurse and patient. Seemingly insignificant riddles, vulnerabilities on both of their parts, and Lib’s eventual choice to save Anna’s life establish their connection. The riddles cleverly show moments of bonding—“She repeated the [riddles] about wind, paper, and flame; she turned to Lib only to confirm one or two words”—that lead up to comfort and eventually love. Anna also confides in Lib, and Lib breaks formalities. A particularly tender moment occurs when Anna learns her nickname: “‘Lib,’ said Anna with a satisfied smile. ‘Hello, Lib.’ It was sweet to hear. Like childhood days, when Lib’s sister still looked up to her, when they’d thought they’d always have each other.”
Donoghue also successfully presents Lib as a special character both within and outside the novel because her voice is portrayed through third-person limited point-of-view, and she is the complete opposite of the other characters. She is singled out within the plot by her level of education (she was taught by Florence Nightingale), her religion (Protestant), and her country of origin (England) in contrast to most of the others characters, who are uneducated, Catholic, and Irish. The diction is so precise that it performs Lib’s educated mind with word choices such as “creosote,” “menses,” “antediluvian,” and “thaumatrope.” Also, the reader experiences the events of the novel entirely through Lib’s perspective. Donoghue distinguishes Lib from the rest of the characters through this distinctive point-of-view and contrast with the other characters.
The setting, an equally strong aspect of the novel, is original in that it is rarely used in novels. The story takes place in mid-19th century Ireland in a town that Lib describes as dull, extraordinarily ordinary, and poor. Not only a distinctive backdrop, the setting serves as an explanation for the popularity of Anna’s story. Little technology and a deeply religious country that suffered a famine a few years before successfully provide a motivation for the characters to believe that Anna can survive without eating.
The plot flows fluidly and rapidly as well. The beginning half of the novel opens with several curiosity-provoking mysteries and conflicts such as whether or not Anna is eating and where her brother has gone. The only distinct separations within the novel are short poems at the chapter breaks. These poems resemble definitions of the words “nurse,” “watch,” “fast,” “vigil,” and “shift,” which adds to the narrative continuity and tension by reflecting the events that occur within the chapter.
The greatest thematic paradox in the novel is that the O’Donnells, Dr. McBrearty (Anna’s doctor), and Mr. Thaddeus (the priest), all of whom are Catholics, do nothing to aid Anna, while Lib Wright, whom a character named William Byrne affectionately calls “blasphemous” and a “heathen,” does everything in her power to save Anna’s life. The narrator effectively criticizes the Catholics for their blind faith in the abstract and their blindness to the physical. They refuse to acknowledge the true psychological issues that Anna battles yet easily claim her to be a living miracle.
On top of all the book’s other strengths, Donoghue adds emotion to the novel by successfully convincing her audience that Lib will do anything for Anna, no matter the personal cost. When speaking to Sister Michael, Lib movingly asserts, “Good nurses follow rules, but the best know when to break them.” Sister Michael and William Byrne help Lib help Anna, but Sister Michael would never have disobeyed from orders if it were not for Lib, and William Byrne does everything primarily for Lib’s sake. There are people who want to help Anna, but Lib learns to love Anna like family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Do you remember your first kiss?” This seemingly-simple question sat at the center of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Stop Kiss,” originally a 1998 American play written by Diana Son. The play, which ran from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24 at the Loeb Ex, answered this question through the lens of the budding relationship between Callie and Sara was additionally interspersed with various scenes following the violent assault after their titular first kiss. As a whole, director Casey J. Durant ’18 presented a passionate retelling of this story due largely to impressive acting, although it suffered from certain sound and lighting choices that detracted from the overall storyline.
“Stop Kiss” unravels two stories at once, alternating scenes that occur before the vicious attack and after. The former story is innocent enough: Callie (Peryn Reeves-Darby ’18) and Sara (Victoria Brancazio) begin to develop feelings for each other in the closed-off setting of Callie’s apartment, and the two share laughs, takeout food, and their experiences. The latter carries a much darker tone. The aftermath of the assault deals with Sara being in a coma, a biased interrogation of Callie by the homophobic Detective Cole (Scott Kall ’20), and the strained hospital visits by both Sara’s ex-boyfriend Peter (also played by Kall) and Callie herself. The dichotomy of these narratives is striking, and as a result, a successful framing of the show presents a rollercoaster of emotions, of highs and lows.
While the cast was generally successful, the star of the show was, without a doubt, Reeves-Darby. Her depiction of Callie was incredibly realistic, and she showed off her skills with a range of emotions, from her awkwardness and playfulness with Brancazio to her utter despondency at Sara’s hospital bed. The performances from the rest of the cast were similarly effective: Robert Rush ’18—who played George, Callie’s close friend—brought a strong comedic presence, while Brancazio impressed with a convincingly awkward Sara that turned endearing. The chemistry between the characters became more compelling as the play went on: Callie and Sara’s relationship developed naturally, bringing the audience along for the ride. The final scene, in which they shared their first kiss, was painfully bittersweet, with the knowledge that the assault would come moments after.
The experimental seating arrangement, in which audience members needed to walk through the set to get to their seats, further set the mood. The cast often used the audience as an invisible mirror, highlighting the confined nature of the show and also allowing the play to be more introspective to the characters themselves. In her director’s note, Durant wrote that she wished to give “voice to these conflicting, complex experiences,” and the design of the show managed to provide a literal reflection for these intricate characters of the BGLTQ community. The music used during transitions between scenes also reflected the mood of the previous scenes: an upbeat, jaunty song after Callie and Sara shared a playful experience; an ethereal, slow set of notes intermittent with a heartbeat tone after the audience saw Sara in a coma. In this way, “Stop Kiss” was unguarded and vulnerable, even naked, allowing its onlookers to personally connect to the lives being played out on stage.
However, several of Durant’s decisions also diminished the play’s success. Most notably, the interrogation scenes with Kall appeared stilted and unrealistic. In part, this was due to an important choice: Using blue and yellow lights over a hotter red rendered these scenes too visually similar to the lighting in Callie’s apartment. As a result, there was no noticeable tone shift between the two scenes. And while Kall did well in portraying Sara’s ex, Peter, his performance as an interrogator was less natural. There was gravity in the actors’ lines, but it was mismatched with an insincere setting and tone. Furthermore, the music used between transitions did little to mark the passage between the past and the future, as the music was awkwardly cut off whenever the next scene started, leading to an irregular progression of the storyline.

iO Tillett Wright is a writer, photographer, TV host, and LGBT activist. In his upcoming memoir, “Darling Days,” Wright describes his relationship with his mother, the challenges of growing up poor, and his transition from girl to boy.
The Harvard Crimson: What has motivated you to be vulnerable and to write this memoir?
iO Tillett Wright: My motivation to write this book was about the fact that my parents are people who are easily classifiable as certain things. People who were neglectful or irresponsible or took a lot of drugs or drank a lot of alcohol and did a bunch of things that people don’t classically associate with parenting. But one thing that my parents really got right was that they always accepted me for who I said that I was. I think that that’s a very important piece of raising a child to be a strong human in the world… and I wanted that story to be told…. There aren’t a lot of people like me who tell their story openly, so I wanted to add another voice to the conversation so that kids who grow up feeling like they aren’t a part of the mainstream world have more of a home in popular culture.
THC: You identified as a boy for eight years. Then at 14 you chose to identify as a girl again. Now you identify as a transgender man. What were those moments of transition like?
iTW: When I was six, I was just living as a boy. I didn’t switch anything…. And I kind of was forced to pick one, and if I wanted to keep doing the things that I liked to do, like play sports…then I had to be a boy. So I was just like, this is what society associates with the way that I live my life, so I guess I will go with that…And then when I was 14, I got taken away from my mom by the government and had to live in Germany… with my father, and while I was there I hit puberty…. I just didn’t know what it would be like to live as a girl, and I thought maybe that’s what my body was telling me it needed, and so I tried that. But that felt very unnatural and very uncomfortable, and it took me about 14 years to figure out that actually, I’ve been expressing my truth all along. And this last transition has been a very long, slow, gradual—hair shorter and shorter, clothes more and more masculine, eventually trying out pronouns, then asking everyone to use male pronouns, and now exploring the possibility of physical transition.
THC: How did you come up with your idea for the Self-Evident Truths project?
iTW: Self-Evident Truths came about because when Prop 8 happened… when marriage was granted in California and then taken away… I was really struck by that notion that I was legally a second class citizen which I had never faced before…. I never really assessed my legal standing as an American. I was appalled. I thought it was a problem with the lack of familiarity because I couldn’t imagine a person who felt that they were defending some free way of living who would be able to look into my eyes and then tell me that I deserved any less rights than they did. So I thought, people just don’t know each other, and they demonize each other… and I want to introduce them to each other.… I decided that I needed to photograph every different… type of human on the spectrum of gender and sexuality as possible. So I started to photograph 10,000 people in all 50 states, and what better place to display them than the National Mall if you’re trying to make a statement about what it is to be an American.
THC: Do you have any ideas or themes you are afraid that may be misunderstood or misconstrued by your readers?
iTW: I think, again, that people are very quick to decide what type of people others are. And I worry about how they will classify my parents. I worry that people will think that gender is something that people just forever switch in and out of because that’s just my narrative. And in a lot of people’s case what they express as a child is not going to change when they hit puberty…. I don’t want that to be taken as some kind of banner for how that always goes with people who express that they are not the gender that they were born as…. Gender is the most deeply personal journey for everyone. And everyone’s journey is different.
THC:  What do you hope people will get out of reading your memoir?

A few nights ago, I stayed up way too late drawing up a CV of my various professional failures. For most of America’s existence, we’ve made a point to celebrate risk-taking, boldness, and even sometimes failure, and I wanted to get a sense of how I stacked up. But what I learned from that exercise was absolutely not what I had expected: While I make a lot of mistakes and get rejected from a lot of opportunities, in the grand scheme of things, I frankly don’t think I’ve failed enough.
The man who popularized the idea of a “CV of failures,” Princeton professor Johannes Haushofer, chose to publicly admit his disappointments and shortcomings because he understands that “Most of what I try fails, but these failures are often invisible, while the successes are visible.” Just look at his actual CV—it’s a holy terror. By any account, he is one of the most highly educated men on the planet. But as his anti-CV demonstrates, he went through a lot of failure to get to where he is now.
In fact, if a CV of failures seems small, it’s almost certainly because you haven’t dared to push yourself to your limits. And if your CV is big but bland, like mine, it’s probably because you haven’t allowed yourself to fully pursue your dreams. Haushofer notes, correctly, that failures are the product of trying. In a preface to his anti-CV, he writes, “[I]f it’s shorter than yours, it’s likely because you have better memory, or because you’re better at trying things than me.”
“Better at trying things than me.” What’s that supposed to mean?
And then I understood.
Before coming to law school, my last four jobs were in political policy, a political campaign, an investment firm, and then another political campaign. The jobs I’d been rejected from were almost entirely government-centric, with a few finance and consulting positions thrown in. The schools I hadn’t gotten into were almost entirely analogous to the schools I actually attended. I had to ask myself: What about the failures that don’t show up in my anti-CV because I never even tried?
And while I think it’s good to know exactly what you want to do, I also think you should be skeptical—relentlessly so—when looking at an anti-resume like mine. In particular, you should continually ask whether the person you’re dealing with simply has a one-track mind.
A great school expands your field of possibilities, but the pressure it places on you to perform in a particular way is psychologically limiting. As a country, we want people who go to great schools (and generally graduate with little or no debt) to follow their dreams—to make decisions independent of concerns about salary or prestige. Yet our alumni—and this is hardly unique to Harvard—generally take the path of least resistance. They don’t normally become authors, activists, or military officers. A military lawyer did try to recruit me a few days ago, but the truth is that I myself won’t be doing any of these things. They’re not what I want to do for a living. But I also have to consider the fact that around here, they’re also simply not the done thing.
Part of this is unavoidable, and not unique to a university. Sometimes, the world eliminates possibilities for you. Growing up, I wanted to be Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, but life eventually taught me that I couldn’t throw a strike. Some things you realize you don’t want to do forever—for me, journalism, travel writing, scripting for the silver screen. And to a certain extent, making money is important—the only shame would be in denying it. But some of my interests I’ve never taken the time to fully explore.
Specialization is unavoidable, but we can try to be thoughtful about the inevitable. I don’t regret the path I’ve taken. Given my particular skills, interests, and obsessions, it’s hard to imagine doing something substantially different. But where we as a university fall short is in the very act of imagining itself. And yet, in life, we rarely regret the things we tried; we always, however, seem to regret the things we never dared to do.
So here’s my suggestion. Harvard is the second-most-cramped school in the Ivy League. People here are everywhere in a way that is truly difficult at times for a California kid to conceptualize. So carve out some time for yourself. Take a moment to be alone.
Few here have the time to meditate like monks. But you can still get out of the Harvard bubble. Bring a beach chair to Boston Common, take a trip to Cape Cod, or even find your own secret spot on campus—trust me, there are a lot of them. Think about where you came from and the person you want to be. Erase the pressure, the distractions, the deadlines, if only for an afternoon. Reclaim your right to think about the big picture.
Your mind will always point you in the rational direction. But don’t let the chaos and clamor of ordinary life completely foreclose the possibility of following your heart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 27, 2016 at 10:50 a.m.
For a school so infatuated with finance, Harvard sorely lacks a grasp of how it actually works. Once again, students are holding its uber-big endowment against it, and once again they are missing the mark. In the midst of a looming University Dining Services strike, which has now ballooned into a proxy war for broader social issues, a myth as old as Harvard itself has resurfaced: that the university has carte-blanche access to its whopping endowment, as if the fund were a bloated piggy bank and Harvard a miserly Scrooge.
The university’s eye-popping seven-billion-dollar fundraising haul has student activists incensed about recent cuts to HUDS workers’ compensation. Students have circulated copious petitions, flyers, and other communiques that give the university a thorough tongue-lashing for its lavish fundraising and concurrent employee neglect. But students have made a connection where there is none by linking the university’s fundraising spree to its employees’ compensation.
Alumni who give money to the University tend to be choosy about where they want their gifts to go. They often give to the financial aid fund, as opposed to the house renewal fund, for example, because they are able to connect their contribution with individual students and have a personal link to their gift. So when they give money to Harvard, and to its colossal endowment, it is usually set aside for a certain purpose—it is not dumped into a general-purpose free-for-all checking account.
The goals listed by the multibillion dollar Harvard Capital Campaign are farcically vague, but even still, they have nothing to do with funding employee health benefits. Donors give money to support “advancing the power of integrated knowledge,” “advancing innovation and hands-on discovery,” and “advancing meaning, values, and creativity” (whatever that means).
Harvard’s gargantuan endowment has become a liability for the university and a straw man for groups seeking to challenge the administration. Divest Harvard has very publicly lambasted the Harvard Management Corporation for investing in fossil fuels. The university has been equated with hoarders for sitting on its endowment. And John Paulson’s gratuitous four-hundred-million-dollar gift to Harvard was as humiliating for the university as it was impressive. Is Harvard’s endowment too big for its own good?
Even accomplished alumni conflate Harvard’s wealth with its available funds.  An “outsider slate” of Candidates for the Harvard Board of Overseers—led by Ron K. Unz, a banker—campaigned on eliminating Harvard tuition on the strength of its hefty endowment.
Perhaps it is time for the university—or even better, one of the countless, interchangeable financial analyst clubs on campus—to give students and alumni a primer on how the endowment actually works.
While it is entirely plausible that HUDS employees are in the right to demand better compensation, they are not helped by students who conjure spurious relationships between the school’s endowment and its employees’ benefits. It is a shame that students’ support of HUDS is marred by this misconception, but it is especially embarrassing that they are retreading a misconception about the university that has been debunked every time it reappears. Their cavalier exploitation of such an easily refuted claim casts doubt on their whole platform.
This will not be the last time Harvard’s fortune is used against it. The endowment haunts the university as much as it sustains it. Now that it has been propelled to center stage in the HUDS showdown—which has been hijacked by students from peripheral schools promoting peripheral issues—the endowment is all but guaranteed to be a bone of contention for many student-led conflicts to come. Even if HUDS employees come to a neat agreement with the university, the battle between students, workers and the university has opened a Pandora’s box of endowment-related angst.
Like those arguing on behalf of HUDS, future student activists will likely be tempted to use the endowment as a rhetorical tool to argue for otherwise credible points. Hopefully they can learn from their predecessors’ errors and not poison their message with a misinformed notion of how Harvard’s wealth works.

Cristian D. Pleters, a Crimson Editorial writer, lives in Lowell House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students across the College begin to prepare for midterms and essays this semester, an unfortunately large number must do so without the laptops that have been stolen from their dorms. During one recent weekend alone, 10 laptops, representing thousands of dollars worth of property, were stolen from River Houses and the Yard. This rate greatly outpaces the 90 annual laptop thefts the Harvard University Police Department estimates occur on campus.
Fortunately, common sense measure could prevent most of these thefts. While tightening Harvard’s comparatively relaxed building security might appear to be necessary as a response to increasing burglaries, restrictions on ID card access have drawbacks that outweigh the advantages to tightened security. It may appear strange or superfluous that a Harvard University college student ID can swipe into nearly all residential spaces at the College, but the advantages of this system are many, as it allows for a more unified campus community.
Each residential college at Yale, by contrast, is only accessible by ID card access to its affiliates. This security protocol is more airtight, but the potential benefits must be measured against the inconvenience students would face. Furthermore, this approach may not even resolve the root of the problem: The Yale system would not have done much to combat laptop theft at Harvard, given that much of it is due to propped-open room doors, poorly hidden room keys, or strangers following a student into a building.
While further ID restrictions are not the answer, other steps can help to keep students’ belongings secure. We continue to endorse the Student Life Committee of the Undergraduate Council’s vote to install security cameras in the entryways of residential buildings on campus, and we agreed with the Committee’s proviso that these cameras should only be used to monitor theft and not other student activity. While these proposals have yet to materialize, we encourage students to take advantages of the resources the University already offers to safeguard laptops. HUPD offers its own laptop database system, and the Department also collaborates with Absolute Software for students that subscribe to the LoJack laptop locking and recovery system.

Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Imagine, if you can, the odor of a 100,000 artisanal globs of curdled milk perspiring gently in the midday heat.
On a Saturday afternoon as mild and earthy as the particularly delicious chevre we’d later try, we find ourselves at an event which 30,000 other people had expressed interest in on Facebook. No, not the [BLANK] party––the Massachusetts Cheese Festival, the fourth annual celebration of the state’s 30 most prestigious cheesemakers.
According to its website, the festival prides itself on offering “enough questions and information to help everyone enjoy our cheeses in traditional, creative, and unusual ways.” We were intrigued. How unusual is unusual? How much cheese does one get for $40? Will FM reimburse us? Are we still lactose intolerant?
Despite our misgivings, we open the twin doors to what appears to be a cheese warehouse––correction: a glorious cheese temple, a glistening aromatic altar to caseiculture. The tables are dotted with framed photos of cuddly baby cows. The staff members wear shirts that say “fromage à trois” (for real cheese lovers?). Giant signs by the entrance bear the message “Healthy. Tasty. Divine.” At the Massachusetts Cheese Festival, cheesiness is next to godliness.
We realize, as we blink at this cheese shrine filled with its cheese people going about their cheese business, that we are out of our cheese league.
The website had promised traditional cheeses, and traditional cheese there is. “This cheese is so fresh, it was in the cow yesterday,” one flannel-clad artisan says, holding aloft a glistening bulb of mozzarella.
More interesting are the creative cheeses. A faintly scatological brown log, about four inches long, rests on a table. Its vendor introduces it as chocolate cheese, and he is continually running out of samples. “We don’t sell as much as you might think,” he says. We wonder how much he thinks we think he sells. “We sell a ton right here, but if you try to approach a cheese department in a supermarket, they don’t know where to put it. They think it’s kind of schmaltzy or gimmicky. But once they try it, it’s wonderful.” He isn’t wrong: It tastes like a well-ripened frappuccino, but in a good way.
At a nearby table, a man politely declines the offer of a spoon with his free sample of locally-made maple yogurt and instead tips his head back and downs it like a shot. As cheese purists, we initially feel conflicted about this, but it’s a brave new pan-dairy world and we eventually come around.
Exhausted by the ceaseless onslaught of free samples (well, “free” in a $40-cover kind of way) and unnerved by the initial grumblings of an enzymatically-challenged small intestine, we decide to participate in the time-honored tradition of cheese-rolling.
We fight our way in search of tips through the adoring crowd to Kelly, the reigning champion of the sport. She assures us that we, too, can roll cheeses in the big league. “I had no experience before this,” she says. “I don’t think you need any.”
The organizer plops a red wax disc ceremoniously into our arms. “Feel how heavy it is,” he says. Determined to make Kelly proud, we roll it like a horribly disfigured bowling ball across the scuffed black stage. We hit the target both times and win a wedge valued at nearly a quarter of our admission to the festival. Kelly was right––no experience necessary.
Bloated with victory, we decide to quit while we’re ahead. On our way out, we accost a few passersby. Everyone we interview seems overjoyed to have spent $40 on the festival; money is no object when cheese is involved.
“Here, cheese is currency,” one man says. It’s hard to gauge his sincerity, and not only because cheese aficionados are a cryptic bunch: Any tell-tale signs of humor are obscured by a quivering spoonful of chive-and-onion cloumage.
Stomachs full and wallets empty, we emerge, sweaty, blinking, from the cheesy twilight into the mild, creamy afternoon of the real world. Everything tastes like cheese. It is high time for us to roll out—waxen, wobbly, but nonetheless triumphant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 26, 2016 at 11:14 p.m.
Black, Canadian, the child of immigrants, queer, woman.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Cassandra Extavour considers each of those descriptions parts of her identity, she said Monday during a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences panel discussion on BGLTQ identities and academic life.
“I can’t separate being queer from any other part of my identity,” Extavour said.
The panel, “Out in Academia: Navigating the job market, grad school, and early career as an LGBTQ academic,” comes in response to GSAS students’ calls for discussions about managing academic life while identifying as queer, according to graduate students.
Speaking to a full Dudley House common room on Monday, four professors addressed some of the challenges they have faced, simultaneously identifying themselves as queer publicly and cultivating professional lives.
Last year, graduate students revamped the organization formerly known as LBGGS (Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Graduate Students) as LGBTQ@GSAS to “create a community of LGBTQ graduate students in GSAS and beyond,” according to the LGBTQ@GSAS Facebook page.
“We are a safe and welcoming space for people of all genders and orientations to meet, socialize, share experiences, discuss issues, plan actions, and get to know each other,” the Facebook page reads.
One graduate student organized Monday’s discussion, which was sponsored by the Women, Gender, & Sexuality department, the Office of Career Services, and GSAS, according to an email from GSAS Director of Communications Ann Hall.
GSAS does not track students who identify as BGLTQ, Hall wrote.
English professor Steph L. Burt, who uses the pronoun “they” and identifies as transgender, outlined four categories that BGLTQ-identifying graduate students will have to consider when applying for jobs and pursuing a career: who they date, how they look, how they describe themselves, and what they choose to study.
Echoing Burt, Assistant Dean for Faculty Affairs Sindhu Revuluri said some academics may end up focusing on race, gender, and sexuality both in their research and in how they present themselves.
“[Any aspect] may be important to you in multiple ways, it may actually not be,” Revuluri said.
Extavour said she often lets her work inform how she wants to present herself in a given situation.
“I’ve been very driven by the science I wanted to learn,” Extavour said, adding that running her lab and serving as a mentor to her researchers has played a role in shaping how she presents herself.
“Because at the end of the day, it’s my lab,” Extavour said. “Cassandra Extavour has to feel comfortable.”
But some graduate students who identify as queer may face housing discrimination, isolation, and other challenges on the job market and in their careers, History of Science associate professor Sophia Roosth said during the panel.
Roosth shared several anecdotes from BGLTQ colleagues who faced discriminatory interviewers. In discussing parental leave policies, for example, Roosth said she heard about one interviewer who assumed that the queer academic would not have children due to her sexuality and said, “‘We can skip this chapter because this does not apply to you.’”
When people do not know how to talk about identity, they may make offensive and demeaning comments, the panelists said.
“My own tactic was trying to have a sense of humor about it,” Revuluri said, adding that the job market vexed her for many reasons. “I wasn’t very publicly out, I was very quietly out.”
Revuluri said she used her inexperience as a tool, preparing for tough interviews and questions that she thought interviewers might ask and that might make her uncomfortable.
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences provides departments with a “Guide to Unacceptable Interview Questions.” Interviewers cannot ask an applicant about maiden name, age, sexuality, religious affiliation, birthplace, relatives, disability, or other personal matters.
The job search remains a precarious period, because for seven to eight years, the people who make those assumptions are both colleagues and bosses, Roosth said.
“Those kinds of interactions can be very exhausting,” Revuluri said.
Extavour urged the students in attendance to prioritize the aspects of their lives that matter most, which could include becoming a professor, conducting research, or running a lab.
“This is a high-luxury job; society doesn’t need us,” Extavour said, advising attendees to determine what they can live without. She said that academia may not suit all people, regardless of how they identify.
“I think the first thing to think about is the first thing you want to be doing,”  Extavour said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nobuo Tanaka, former executive director of the International Energy Agency and president of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, argued Tuesday that cooperation in energy efforts should play a vital role in collaboration and peacekeeping in Asia.
During a talk titled “A Vision for Asian Collective Energy Security” at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Tanaka highlighted the potential for energy issues to both stir conflict and inspire partnership between nations, citing recent territorial disputes over oil-rich waters in the South China Sea.
“Energy has a very geopolitical and strategic nature,” Tanaka said.
Drawing on the success of the European Coal and Steel Community in encouraging European cooperation and peacebuilding after World War II, Tanaka illustrated the potential benefits of energy collaboration in ensuring regional stability.
“For Asia, if countries are interested in peace in the future, starting with controlling and coordinating energy is ultimately the first step,” he said.
For example, the “Asia Super Grid”—a prospective energy infrastructure project that would link electrical grids in Japan, Korea, Russia, and China—could serve as a source of political collaboration as well as a practical solution to rising energy demands, Tanaka said.
According to Tanaka, this rising energy demand is reflected globally. State actors and policymakers will likely face challenges after U.S. shale production subsides and oil prices increase, he said.
Tanaka also addressed climate change and said significant political motivation will be required to maintain carbon dioxide emissions within reasonable limits. In 2007, the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrote that a rise in global mean temperature of more than two degree Celsius by the end of the century “poses significant risks to many unique and threatened systems.”
“The [International Energy Agency] believes that, despite the [2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference], CO2 emissions will continue to grow,” Tanaka said. “To make it to the two degree Celsius trajectory, you have to really reduce CO2 emissions with different technologies.”
These changes would be costly, according to Tanaka, and would require sufficient political mobilization in order to invest in a more diverse “energy mix,” including renewable and nuclear energy. The influence of large carbon producers is particularly important in combatting this issue, Tanaka added.
“If China starts getting serious about combatting climate change, then other countries will follow,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously voiced its support for Harvard University Dining Services workers’ potential movement to strike and delivered biting criticism of the Harvard administration in a vote Monday evening.
In a resolution sponsored by Mayor E. Denise Simmons, Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., the Council pledged to join the picket lines on Harvard’s campus in the event that HUDS does, in fact, strike. The resolution’s passage sparked loud cheers from the public gallery, a rare event at most City Council meetings.
In an overwhelming 591-18 vote, HUDS workers moved to authorize a strike if Harvard does not comply with their demands for altered health benefits and increased wages. Local 26, which has been bargaining with the University since mid-June, said it may strike if significant progress towards a settlement has not been made by the end of its next scheduled session with Harvard Tuesday; other sessions could me scheduled.
In a statement, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that the University “deeply values the contributions” of HUDS workers, and that Harvard is “committed to bargaining in good faith towards an agreement....”
McGovern, who attended a rally the workers held in early September, said during the council meeting that he was frustrated with Harvard’s current position on the negotiations.
“It seems like we’re in this position a lot, where there are institutions that have an abundance of resources and are asked to simply do minimal things for the people they work for,” McGovern said. “Harvard crying poor is not something that goes over well with me.”
HUDS supporters have cited the University's recent announcement that it has raised more than $7 billion in its capital campaign as an indication it has enough resources to supplement workers' salaries. But the University and analysts contend this argument, saying Harvard cannot simply pull money from the campaign.
Mayor Simmons suggested marching in front of Massachusetts Hall to gain the attention of University President Drew G. Faust, whose offices are located in that building.
“We’ll have to continue to do this and maybe we’ll have to don our red shirts and sneakers and walk a few blocks just to get Harvard’s attention,” Simmons said.
HUDS workers, undergraduates, and Medical School students attended the meeting and many spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting. Their presence continues a month-long publicity campaign by a cohort of Harvard affiliates.
Indeed, September has been punctuated by fervent cries of support from organizations across Harvard’s campuses, particularly at the Medical School. Most recently, four medical school student advocates penned an analysis denouncing the health care plan Harvard proposed to its workers at the start of the contract talks, though Harvard contends much of their analysis.
Last week, 15 groups at Harvard Law School released a statement slamming the Universtiy for its stalemate with its dining workers. The week before, more than 100 students from Harvard’s Medical and Dental schools gathered in front of Longwood’s iconic Gordon Hall to demonstrate their support of HUDS’ intent to strike.
Additionally, a petition started by the Student Labor Action Movement—a group that has supported Harvard unions in the past—has garnered more than 2,700 signatures since it was first launched two weeks ago, according to SLAM member Farris M. Peale ’18, who attended the meeting.
This is hardly the first time the Cambridge City Council has waded into labor conflicts at Harvard. Last semester, the body backed Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student efforts to form a union. The Council passed an order last week commending the National Labor Relations Board victory for GSAS unionization.
The Council also publicly supported the Local 26-led boycott of the Harvard-owned Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Suites hotel during unionization negotiations in 2014. Those employees succeeded in their efforts and unionized with Local-26 in 2015.

The letters “TM” could eventually adorn the T-shirts and posters seen around campus for Harvard’s flagship undergraduate computer science course, now that “CS50” is one step closer to receiving a trademark on its name, according to public filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Both the University and CS50’s instructor, David J. Malan ’99, have made efforts to trademark the popular course’s name, though now only Harvard’s application remains active. Harvard’s push to trademark the course’s name faced difficulties last April when the USPTO denied portions of the University’s application, saying that “CS50” and “CS50X” were too similar to “CSO50” and “CSO40,” conferences hosted by International Data Group, a Boston-based technology and media organization. 
In early September, though, the University filed documents with USPTO indicating it had entered into a coexistence agreement with the International Data Group, in which both parties agreed their respective trademarks were distinctive enough to coexist without causing confusion for consumers.
“Based on the differences in the marks and the nature of each party’s services [...] Harvard’s use and pending registration of the CS50 and CS50x marks, and IDG’s use and registration of the CSO40 and CSO50 marks as set forth above, do not and will not create a likelihood of confusion among consumers,” the agreement reads.
Coexistence agreements can help expedite patent applications in situations like CS50’s, although they do not necessarily guarantee success, according to Georgetown Law professor and trademark expert Rebecca L. Tushnet ’95.
“The agreement of the parties is treated as some kind of evidence that they can coexist, but it’s still the case that for [trademark] registration purposes, the examiner still asks can they coexist without confusion,” Tushnet said. “It’s a way to let both of them go forward, and usually they do it in order to get a trademark registration or have them both appear.”
While coexistence agreements are not uncommon, Tushnet said, they are not generally preferred by applicants in that they often represent a kind of “concession on both sides” or set parameters for each party’s use of the similar names.
CS50, officially titled Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” has grown rapidly in recent years. It has seen high enrollments, along with an expansion to Yale last September and a foray into high school computer science curricula. Its office hours have filled Widener Library’s Loker Reading Room and inspired a mock protest. This year, the course can be completed almost entirely virtually, and students have access to even more extensive office hours.
Now that the USPTO has received Harvard’s filings, it will consider the evidence presented and decide whether CS50 and CSO50 are indeed distinct enough to coexist. This process could take a few months, Tushnet said.
Malan did not respond to request for comment, while University spokesperson David J. Cameron declined to comment on Harvard’s efforts to trademark the course’s name.

Harvard moved Friday to dismiss an ongoing lawsuit alleging race-based discrimination in its admissions processes, arguing that the plaintiffs in the case—anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions—lack grounds to litigate on behalf of its members.
SFFA first brought the case against Harvard in 2014, claiming that the University uses “racial quotas” and “racial balancing” in its admissions processes, arguing this would disadvantage Asian American applicants. The suit is currently in the “discovery” phase, and earlier this month the presiding judge ordered Harvard to release six cycles of admissions data, including the more than 35,000 applications it has received per year. 
Legal counsel for Harvard presented two motions for court review Friday. The first, which calls for the dismissal of the lawsuit entirely, argues that SFFA “cannot demonstrate that its members control the organization and that it genuinely represents them,” therefore leaving SFFA without legal standing to litigate on their behalf.
The other motion asks for the dismissal of two clauses of SFFA’s complaint against the University on grounds that they contradict Supreme Court rulings, including the recent Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin decision, which upheld race-conscious admissions policies as constitutional.
Legal counsel for Harvard filed several documents in support of the first motion, including the deposition of SFFA Director Edward J. Blum—who, as director of the Project on Fair Representation, helped assemble Fisher’s legal team—and the organization’s 2013 tax exemption request to the Internal Revenue Service.
In a memorandum filed Monday outlining the arguments for dismissal, the University used these documents to argue that SFFA’s members “have no power to influence [the organization’s] conduct, play no meaningful role in funding it, and do not otherwise participate in its activities.”
Harvard cited SFFA’s tax exemption form, in which organization states in its articles of incorporation that “The Corporation shall have no members.”
Harvard has called for the release of details of Students for Fair Admissions membership throughout the discovery process, arguing in a letter in April that the University is “entitled to discovery related to SFFA’s standing.” Responding in another letter, SFFA argued that releasing membership details would infringe on the privacy of its members. The presiding judge has previously denied most of Harvard’s requests for SFFA’s membership information.
SFFA filed a letter Monday in response to Harvard’s motions and memoranda in which it calls the motions “procedurally improper.” In the letter, SFFA asks that the court refrain from judgment on the motions until the end of the discovery process, which is slated for March 2, 2018 according to a court agenda filed at the beginning of the month.
Stetson University law professor Peter F. Lake ’81 said it is common in the litigation process for both sides to point to structural organization as legal grounds for dismissal.
“Very often one of the things that gets resolved or at least argued about early on in the case is, ‘Does the organization have a right to argue the case?’” Lake said.
Despite Harvard’s motions this weekend, the case could continue without a ruling on either motion because the judge does not face a specific time frame.
“Harvard is trying to end the litigation now, and there’s always a chance that could be successful but if it’s not, this could go on for some time,” Lake said. “What is a little interesting, I think, is that it is one of the first litigations in the immediate post-Fisher universe, and so people will be watching.”
Representatives of Students for Fair Admissions and the Harvard Admissions Office declined to comment on the new motions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirty-three candidates jockeyed for positions on the Senior Class committee on Monday—a decline from previous years—employing campaign strategies that ranged from Facebook events and semi-personal emails to canvassing in dining halls.
For the past two years, about 50 candidates have vied for eight Senior Class Marshal positions, through which class members help plan events throughout the year and May’s Commencement exercises.
Seniors cast their ballots on Monday in the first round of voting; the second round will begin Wednesday, after the candidate pool is winnowed down to 16 people. The top two candidates from Wednesday’s vote will be crowned First and Second Marshals and the next six as Program Marshals.
Voting did not proceed without incident. According to Leanne C. Gaffney, assistant director of undergraduate engagement at the Harvard Alumni Association, some seniors did not receive the voting link when it was first released Monday morning. Gaffney said HAA reset each senior’s voting link after hearing of the issue.
Some candidates’ platforms touched on key campus issues such as the availability of social spaces and Harvard’s new policy penalizing members of unrecognized single gender social organizations, starting with the Class of 2021, like final clubs and Greek life.
David J. Coletti ’17, who uses the pronoun they, wrote in an email that they believed discourse on the sanctions revolves largely around questions of “inclusivity, safety, and respecting the voices of those who identify with a marginalized group,” and that they intend to tackle this issue if elected.
“The events I want to plan and collaborate on would not be punch events—they would be open to all, regardless of one’s background,” Coletti wrote. “My platform would not isolate those who, because of their personal experiences and identities, feel that they could not contribute or participate in the programs of their class.”
Other platforms were more light-hearted. Sally H. Na ’17 said she “wanted to take time to spend with people,” and so she ran for the position to get to know more members of her class. Na said she specifically intends to host a “multicultural drink tasting night” for seniors should she win.
Candidates took to Facebook and sent emails, both personal and impersonal, in attempts to reach as many classmates as possible to remind them of the election, detail their platforms, and make best impressions before the vote Monday.
Stephen A. Turban ’17, running on a platform of “More small spaces for reflecting outside of Harvard,” said he sent so many Facebook messages in his campaign efforts that the social media site blocked him from sending any more.
Coletti  said their campaign strategy prioritized face-to-face conversations with voters in an effort to promote honesty and transparency.
“Senior year can be very, very stressful, so I have been trying to approach this campaign in a manner that respects other people's space and schedule,” Coletti wrote.
Campus jokesters also quickly jumped on the bandwagon.  A Facebook page dubbed “President Drew Faust for Class Marshal,” promised the senior class “[a] Class Day speaker who is a civil war historian, a feminist icon, and the President of Harvard University” and a “Larry Summers Dunk Tank.”
Faust did not appear on Monday’s ballot.

The Institute of Politics’ John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum was filled to capacity with students eager to watch Hillary R. Clinton and Donald J. Trump duke it out during Monday’s presidential debate, leaving nearly 50 people outside in the cold, barred from entering the packed auditorium.
Across Harvard’s campus, students, professors, and affiliates crowded residential House common rooms and packed into lecture halls to watch the much-anticipated first presidential debate of the general election.
Crowds did not take long to reveal their political leanings; Clinton’s introduction was greeted with loud applause, drowning out debate moderator Lester D. Holt’s introduction of Trump, the Republican nominee. Throughout the night, the crowds expressed their approval for Clinton’s policies, while generally disapproving of Trump. At the IOP watch party, one heckler shouting that Trump is “an idiot” was met with approval from the rest of the audience.
Monday night’s debate touched on race relations with police, nuclear proliferation, NATO, and the candidates’ proposed economic plans, among other topics. The contest also featured attacks on both of the candidates’ characters, with Trump taking on Clinton for her “temperament” and “stamina” and Clinton attacking Trump for employing disrepuable business practices and propagating the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.
While a strongly pro-Clinton crowd dominated the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, the Harvard Republican Club, which earlier this year declined to endorse Trump for president, met in a smaller room next door.
“I’m happy we were able to get this room reserved,” Republican Club President Declan P. Garvey ’17 said. “Many people in here were cheering for Hillary, just a little bit quieter.”
Garvey emphasized that “the vast majority of people in this room are neither for Trump nor Clinton,” but added that he thought “Hillary did way better than Trump.”
Vice President of the Harvard Republican Club Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said most people in the room “weren’t rooting for either” candidate and “can’t see either [Trump or Clinton] running the country.”
Meanwhile, the Harvard College Democrats, after being turned away from the full event at the Institute of Politics, migrated to the Harvard In  to watch with a group of Winthrop residents.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, the campus outreach director for the Harvard College Democrats, said “The IOP was really crowded tonight and for those who wanted the community feel that we have here [in Winthrop] that just wasn’t possible there…. The Dems tried to organize a section [at the IOP] and they shut the doors off so more folks couldn’t enter.”
“I think they saw who was the fit person for president and who was throwing a temper tantrum up on stage,” Freeland added. “I don’t think the questions were as hard-hitting as they could have been but I do think that each candidate was actually held to answer the questions, which I do think is important just for dialogue and democracy.”
Alexandra “Sasha” Shpitalnik ’19, also a member of the Democrats, said she “thought [the debate] was a good representation of both of the candidates.”
The debate, held at Hofstra University in New York, marked the first of three debates in which Clinton and Trump will face off. Going into the debate, the former secretary of state held a 2.3-point advantage in an average of eight major polls, down from the 7.9-point advantage she held at the beginning of August.

Freshman forward Bente van Vlijmen had a stellar weekend for the field hockey squad, scoring three of Harvard’s five goals to lead the group over Yale by a 2-0 score and No. 19 Maine by a 3-1 count.
Bente’s strong play against the Bulldogs (4-4, 0-1 Ivy) and the Black Bears (7-3) came as no surprise to her coach.
“Bente is a fantastic field hockey player,” Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “She’s from the Netherlands, where people get a stick put in their hands when they’re three years old, so she has those skills.... The goal today and the goal on Friday show her quality.”
If van Vlijmen was experiencing freshman jitters, she certainly did not show it in the weekend opener at home against Yale. The forward made her mark just seconds into Crimson’s first Ivy League contest of the year. Sophomore forward Kathleen Young intercepted an errant Bulldog pass and relayed the ball onto van Vlijmen.
With the composure of a seasoned veteran, the freshman forward dodged and weaved past two Yale defenders in the circle. Staring down the Bulldog goalkeeper, van Vlijmen did not hesitate and scored with a backhand shot to put the Harvard up, 1-0.
After the fast start, the Crimson dominated, maintaining possession and testing Yale senior goalkeeper Emilie Katz often. Yet with less than 10 minutes to go in the half Harvard had failed to capitalize on any more of their chances.
“We had a great start with a goal in 31 seconds, and then it became a typical Ivy League game,” van Herwaarden said. “Balls can be fought for, and it’s going to be a matter of who works the best and who wants to put in the most work.”
The Crimson continued to grind and generate opportunities. In the 26th minute on the team’s fourth penalty corner of the game van Vlijmen came up big again. Senior midfielder Kyla Cordey passed up the ball to junior midfielder Ellie Cookson, who stopped it at the top of the circle for van Vlijmen to strike. The forward blasted the ball off Katz and into the cage for her second score.
“I just did my thing,” van Vlijmen said. “But it’s amazing to score two goals in your first Ivy League game as a freshman…. I couldn’t believe it.”
Harvard had a quick turnaround in play, facing regional powerhouse Maine less than 48 hours after the Yale game. The Crimson didn’t show any signs of weariness, however, jumping out to a 2-0 lead, following goals from freshman forward Maddie Earl in the 19th minute and senior forward Marissa Balleza in the 38th minute.
After such a dominant showing against Yale, it would have been easy for van Vlijmen and the rest of the Crimson team to take their foot off the offensive gas pedal. The group did just the opposite, and van Vlijmen delivered another goal in the 43rd minute for Harvard’s third and final goal of the day.
The play was strikingly similar to her second goal of the Yale game. Off a penalty corner, Cordery delivered to Cookson, who settled it at the top of the circle. Again, the freshman forward unleashed on the ball with smooth swing. This time it went un-touched, flying into the cage past Maine junior goalkeeper Emma Cochran.
Van Vlijmen has started in six of eight games this year and is already ranked second amongst a talented Crimson squad with six points on the year. Her performance has earned her the high praise from her teammates early in the season.
“She’s awesome. She’s dynamite,” Balleza said. “Especially on the forward line, she has an unreal shot...it’s fun to play with her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Last Saturday in Providence, R.I. was a perfect day for football—close to 70 degrees and slightly breezy. It was not, however, a perfect day for Harvard football.
Although the Crimson eventually pushed past Brown, 32-22, the visitors failed to score in the first and fourth quarters and made plenty of mistakes in between. The Bears held a 3-0 lead for much of the opening period and came a single two-point conversion away from forcing a single-possession game in the final four minutes of the contest.
Decisive the game may not have been. But in Ivy League standings, just as in football standings everywhere, a pretty win counts as much as an ugly one.
SECONDARY IS SECONDARY
The premier matchup in Saturday’s contest pitted Brown wide receiver Alexander Jette against Harvard captain Sean Ahern. In 2015, both players made the All-Ivy first team for the second time in their careers, setting up this 2016 showdown as a clash of titans.
Ahern and Jette did in fact square off throughout the contest, but by the end of the afternoon, a larger battle has seized the headlines: the Crimson secondary versus the Bears receiving corps.
In the final 30 minutes, Brown quarterback Kyle Moreno torched Harvard for 208 yards and two touchdowns. However, he also threw two interceptions during the half.
“With the interceptions, it’s always nice to get off the field and kind of shift the momentum,” senior safety Kolbi Brown said. “But we definitely have a lot to work on as a secondary unit.”
Frequently targeted was sophomore defensive back Wesley Ogsbury. Normally a second-teamer, Ogsbury came in for senior Raishau McGhee and struggled at times: On one third down in the third quarter, he slipped on the grass, allowing Jette to scamper to a 36-yard gain.
Yet Ogsbury atoned for his mistakes when, with eight minutes to play, he picked off Moreno near midfield and ran down the Harvard sideline in celebration.
The defensive back’s checkered afternoon mirrored that of the rest of his teammates. On one hand, junior defensive back Tanner Lee and Brown both grabbed picks. On the other hand, Bears receiver Troy Doles broke free for a pair of wide-open scores. Even Ahern had a moment of weakness when senior wideout Garrett Swanky out-leapt him in the end zone for a late score.
“I think we did well besides a couple coverage busts, which is the reason behind the large amount of passing yards,” Lee said. “I think we played well as a unit.”
SEE MORE OF SEMAR
As a team, Brown accumulated 54 rushing yards; as an individual, Harvard running back Semar Smith eclipsed that mark in one half of play.
By the time all the dust had settled, the junior had accumulated 89 yards on 22 attempts and settled the question of who would lead the Crimson’s rushing attack.
He ran with force throughout the game, bowling over defenders. That physicality awarded him two touchdowns, one to get Harvard on the board in the second quarter and one to put the visitors out of reach in the third. Smith topped a ground game that netted 189 yards on 43 rushing attempts. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano accounted for 76 of those yards, while sophomore Noah Reimers, the only other back to take a handoff, ended with zero yards.
Last season’s running back Paul Stanton Jr. ended a three-year reign of dominance with an 809-yard season, but besides a legacy of 38 touchdowns, he left behind the question of who would succeed him. Both Reimers and Smith had shown moments of potential, and sophomore rusher Charlie Booker also entered the mix.
But after two games, it appears that Smith has seized the starting job for good—or at least until fate or coach Tim Murphy intervenes.
“He’s our best back,” Murphy said. “He’s a really good football player.... Obviously he’s a guy that’s hard to take out of the game when he’s playing so well.”
POOR RICH
As Smith’s star rose, left tackle Max Rich watched his own come crashing into Earth.
One of two returning starters on the offensive line, Rich entered preseason with a task as large as his 6’7” frame: replacing the hole left by the graduation of Anthony Fabiano, Adam Redmond, and Cole Toner. All three of those players had led a dominant Crimson line and later signed contracts with NFL teams.
Early in Saturday’s game, Rich was performing well, yielding no sacks and opening up large holes for Smith. But after one goal-line play, he remained on the ground for a few seconds, eventually willing himself off the field. He didn’t reappear for the rest of the game.
“Max said he could play,” Murphy said. “Sports med[icine] held him out, and that’s all that matters. If they think he should be out, then he’s out.”
To compensate for the absence, Harvard trotted out a few different offensive line combinations. Sophomore Ben Shoults took some snaps at center, but no look worked perfectly. Midway through the fourth, Viviano took two sacks in three snaps, leading to the Crimson’s second three-and-out of the afternoon.
Rich’s absence was likely temporary, however. At the end of the game, Murphy stressed that Rich hadn’t gone through the full medical protocol but expressed confidence that the senior could return for this Friday’s contest against Georgetown.
“From his demeanor, I would say he has a good chance of playing next week,” Murphy said. “Anytime you get a [replacement] that’s never really played in there at left tackle, which is a premier position, it’s a challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While freshman standout Bente van Vlijmen earned Athlete of the Week honors for her three-goal weekend performance on the field hockey pitch, other Crimson athletes had solid games of their own.
PAIGE KEBE, OUTSIDE HITTER, WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL
In its first Ivy League matchup of the season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team defeated rival Dartmouth with an offensive performance from junior outside hitter Paige Kebe.
Despite losing the conference opener to Dartmouth (6-5, 0-1 Ivy) in the two seasons prior to this one, Friday’s match was won handedly by the Crimson (3-7, 1-0) in three sets (27-25, 25-16, 25-23). Kebe led the team in kills with 11, while teammates sophomore Christina Cornelius, freshman Maclaine Fields and freshman Grace Roberts Burbank each added seven of their own. Kebe also tallied a dig, a block and, with her 26 total attempts, a hitting efficiency of .346. Overall, the junior hitter led the team with 11.5 points on the match.
With the win, Kebe’s kills for the season rise to 76, the second best for the team behind only Cornelius, who currently sits at 83. Now with 270 total attempts, her hitting efficiency has risen to .167 and her total points to 82.5, the third highest for the team.
This Friday, the women’s volleyball team looks to maintain their undefeated Ivy League record in a match at Princeton. The Tigers (7-3, 1-0) are also looking to sustain an unblemished conference record as they are coming off a close five-set victory against Penn.
DEFENSIVE BACKS, FOOTBALL
Traveling to Providence to play Brown in their annual Homecoming game, the Harvard football team (2-0, 1-0) held its pass-happy opponent to only three touchdowns through the air in the path to a 32-22 victory.
The Crimson’s defensive backs played a heavy hand in holding Brown (1-1, 0-1) standout senior receiver Alex Jette to 79 yards, in addition to intercepting quarterback Kyle Moreno on three separate occasions. The first of these came early in the second quarter at the hands of senior safety Kolbi Brown. Grabbing the ball at the Brown 45, the Crimson safety returned it to the 20, giving the offense the opportunity to capitalize on the turnover with a field goal.
Up 32-16 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Crimson defense struggled as the Bears marched down the field. As Brown drove to the Harvard 19, their offensive push was stopped with a well timed interception by junior safety Tanner Lee on the Crimson’s own two-yard line. Lee would return the ball 21 yards to the Harvard 23. However, the drive would end in a fumble for Harvard.
Again, Brown charged down field, stopped by yet another interception, this time by sophomore cornerback Wesley Ogsbury on the Harvard 37 yard-line. It would be these two late interceptions that kept the Brown offense at bay throughout the fourth quarter, securing the win for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first home matches of the fall season, the Harvard women’s tennis team faced three competitors: Boston University, Boston College, and Ivy League rival Yale. After claiming a close victory in the first match of the weekend against the Terriers on Friday at the Beren Tennis Center, the Crimson was unable to best either of its weekend opponents, resulting in a 1-2 weekend performance.
Facing injuries and illnesses among a few of the squad’s returning players from a year ago, Harvard thrust its rookies into the lineup, as Nika Besker, Natasha Gonzalez, Irene Lu, Lexi Milunovich, and Kaelli Thiel all played impactful roles throughout the weekend in both singles and doubles. With the group playing in its first home match for the Crimson, the experience gave it exposure to greater challenges and opportunities than junior tennis had to offer.
“Although we weren't as strong as we could be due some of last year’s starters being injured, it gave several freshmen the opportunity to play and work with the coaches on court,” Milunovich said. “This is a change from junior tennis when you can't receive coaching unless you split sets and for only 10 minutes. Coach Traci [Green]’s advice helped me clinch the second set and win my match against Yale.”
In the match against BU, the team kicked off the doubles events on strong footing, winning three of the four events in the category. The competition was much tighter in the singles matches, however, as the group of co-captain June Lee, sophomore Isabel Jasper, Besker, Gonzalez, Milunovich, and Thiel went 3-3, allowing Harvard to clinch a narrow victory through the doubles tiebreaker.
Lee provided the decisive victory in the match at the No. 1 position as the afternoon sun faded to darkness in the final matchup of the day. After losing the first set, 7-6, against Terrier junior Iryna Kostriko, she pulled even with her own victory, 7-6, in the second set and used that momentum to carry her to a 10-8 win in the third set tiebreaker. Had Lee lost, the Terriers would have claimed the match win for themselves.
“We had a strong showing against Boston University in our opening match,” Milunovich said. “June [Lee]...was the last match playing. It was a thriller under the lights as she came back from down a set and down, 5-2, to win the second set in a tiebreaker and then win the deciding tiebreaker after they split.”
The Crimson’s other Boston competitor, Boston College, proved to be a much greater test on Sunday, as Harvard went winless in doubles. In the singles portion of the event, sophomore Erica Oosterhout was the only Crimson competitor to claim victory, as she bested No. 103 ranked Lexi Boor of Boston College in two sets, 7-5, 6-3.
Harvard fared similarly in its match against Saturday against Yale, winning two of the six singles matches, while again failing to claim victory in doubles. Lu and Milunovich produced the two successful outings for the Crimson, both having fought back from first set losses only to win in three. Gonzalez nearly completed her own come from behind victory against her Yale counterpart, Amy Yang, but ultimately faded in a hard fought third set.
“Yale is always a tough matchup,” junior Nikki Kallenberg said. “It was a great opportunity to see some of their cards going into the Yale Invite in two weeks and of course for Ivy season in the spring.”
Overall, the team will treat this weekend as a platform to build off of, as they look forward to the challenges ahead in remainder of Harvard’s fall and spring matchups.
“Since this is one of our first matches of the season, we definitely still have to get into the rhythm of match play,” Kallenberg said. “With seven freshmen adjusting to college tennis from juniors, the fall will be a great time for them to prepare before the spring.”

With the onset of the fall semester comes the usual rush to prepare for an all new set of classes that promise to be panic-inducing in all new ways. But an additional rude awakening was in store this year for students taking Ec 10a. The course now requires that students buy a new loose-leaf course pack for a whopping $132, a change that the course head and textbook author N. Gregory Mankiw stands by. You could be glad you didn’t enroll, or holding back tears because you did; either way, we at Flyby have a carefully curated selection of objectively better things you could’ve spent that cash money on.
Get your H sweater on
Technically, fall has arrived, which means it’s time to be the early bird and get your classic, cliché H sweater. Priced at $100, well below the Ec 10 course pack, the staple Harvard sweater will ensure you never look less than obnoxiously Ivy League. You could actually own the sweater before Harvard-Yale in November if you step on it! Bonus: on those chilly days around town, you can just point at your sweater if anyone asks you what school you go to. Better not to waste your breath on plebes, right?
Beat back hunger
Need a little something to fire up your brain before getting back to psets? Or a nighttime snack to cheer you up after that terrible party you ditched? No fear, because Insomnia Cookies delivers 100 cookies for $121. Alternatively, if the sweet stuff doesn’t do it for you, make your way to JFK Street’s Tasty Burger and get yourself 21 burgers, or 13 burger-fries-beer combos. You could share with your whole squad… or not. Who are we kidding.
Free shipping, and streaming? Check
All that you didn’t spend on the Principles of Economics, you can spend on the capitalist trappings that every college student needs: Amazon Prime Student, Netflix, and Spotify Premium. According to our calculations, you can use your $132 on 17 months of Netflix, 26 months of Spotify Premium, or nearly three and a half years of Amazon Prime. Yes, you read that right. Why would you ever want to spend on higher education again?
Fancy food, not fast food, please
That saved $132 sure makes you feel like you’re rolling in it. So why not look at some more upscale dining options? At Alden & Harlow on Brattle Street, you can treat yo’self six times to warm smoked lamb breast, grilled bluefish, or merguez tortellini, whatever that is. Bogie’s Place in Boston will spot you with $70 Russian caviar. Asta, also in Boston, serves a three-course meal for $50, so how about two fancy meals in a row, hmm?
Leave the Harvard bubble
If you want to leave campus far, far behind—seriously? The semester literally just started. If you insist, though, fly to Las Vegas in October for $117! Just one caveat: that’s a one-way fare. Well, Flyby can’t do everything for you. Maybe taking the leftover $15 to the roulette tables might win you a way back?
Take a stand against what Mankiw stands for!

With the tragic closure of Greenhouse Cafe last spring, Harvard students are on the hunt for another venue where they can satiate their appetites in between classes. Because we’re just as desperate for a new place to waste our board plus, Flyby sampled the fare at the Barker Center cafe.
In terms of presentation, Barker gets an A+; it’s an idyllic cafe, and all of the sandwiches are neatly wrapped on a display under the counter. The price is not particularly damaging to your wallet, as  you can get a half sandwich for four dollars and some change, and full sandwich for just a little under $10.

We sampled two of the most recognizable Barker sandwiches to see if they new Barker Center fare can live up to the sterling reputation of the Greenhouse Cafe
Classic Grilled CheeseWith the classic grilled cheese, you get almost exactly what you expect—but with somewhat of a twist.  With cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses, sliced tomato, and spicy mustard on thick sourdough bread, it’s a solid sandwich, albeit difficult to stomach when it’s not heated up. Not to mention the tomato is a bit soggy. Still, overall, it’s a solid rendition of a classic favorite, although it may be a little underwhelming and simplistic given its high price tag.
Allan Likes it GrilledBizarrely named “Allen Likes it Grilled,” this sandwich is made with grilled chicken breast, Monterey Jack cheese, roasted tomato, arugula, sweet pickles, and serrano mayo dressing on sourdough bread. Aside from the tiny fact that the flavor of the sandwich can be drowned out by the overly rich mayo dressing, the sandwich is a solid pick for an afternoon snack. Still, when this bad boy is heated up, it’s like eating something from a professional deli (are you sensing a trend here?)
The VerdictOverall, the fare at the Barker Center cafe seems much haughtier than the food offered by the Greenhouse cafe. Those students looking for a quick slice of pizza will likely leave disappointed. But for those who are willing to take the 5 minute walk and spend nearly 5 dollars on half a sandwich, the “Allen Likes it Grilled” is definitely the best bang for your board plus; it’s richer and definitely more fulfilling than its smaller, yet equally priced cousin, the simple grilled cheese.
While those who consider (probably falsely) their palates to be more refined than that of the average Harvard undergraduate, the Barker Center cafe is a good bet. However, those who desire a similar gastronomic experience to Greenhouse should search elsewhere. If only there were still places to search for…

What’s up, Harvard? Guess what– your favorite journalistic, blockmate/BFF, crime-fighting (not really) duo is back to answer all your burning questions in our biweekly advice column, Listen Up! That’s right, we’re Betty and Hyemi, just two senior girls living in Dunster who want to share all of the knowledge we’ve accrued from our time here at Harvard with you. We know you’re all dying to benefit from our guidance before we graduate. And did we mention that we offer advice pertaining to a ~wealth~ of topics? Want to impress your TF? We can help you there. Need help getting the attention of that cute guy you always see at LamCaf? Yep, we got it. Exhausted all other methods of procrastination and need something else? Oh, do we have solutions for you.
Submit your questions here because how could you possibly turn down advice from those two lovely faces above?
Below are some questions we received from last semester that we’re going to answer because we’re #responsible:
What’s your worst date story?
Hyemi: My worst date story is actually from a date back in high school that I wasn’t even on personally, but was third-wheeling to introduce two of my friends to each other. I was setting up my best friend with another friend I knew from class who both expressed interest in each other but for some reason felt too weird hanging out without me (see, not my fault). We went to see the movie Lincoln, and when my friend Bob (fake names or else both parties could potentially murder me for sharing this publicly) entered the row of seats in the theater, my best friend Jane hesitated sitting next to him so I went in next and sat between them. Let it be known that watching movies is my least favorite activity ever, especially at movie theaters because I basically pay for a nap. Yes, I fell asleep as soon as the trailers started and when I woke up, Lincoln was dead and the movie was over. Jane and Bob eventually went on a real date without me and had a lovely little fling, but they told me that the movie date was the most awkward 2.5 hours of their lives. Oops.
Betty: My worst date story is that I’ve never really been on one. Pretty brutal. I hope my parents don’t see this. Hit a girl up, though.
When is it appropriate to fart in front of a significant other?
Hyemi: Oh my goodness, this question was made for us. Betty and I love to talk about our digestive health – and for all of you judgmental readers, health is wealth! This is one of those questions that is super ~probing and revelatory~ about how comfortable you feel in front of your significant other. If you spend a lot of time with your significant other and like to go out to eat, chances are you will probably have to #LetItRip at some point. If it’s not one of those “oh my goodness who just unpeeled 5 million hard-boiled eggs” farts, I’d be fine letting it loose because your significant other will probably find it cute in one of those “aw, this is relatable” and “yay, you feel comfortable enough in front of me” ways. And if it’s a deadly one, save it for a fight.
Betty: This means everything to me. I am a firm believer in the mantra “treat yourself,” and you can’t “treat yourself” if you’re feeling the flatulence. It’s simply never a comfortable situation. I will never trust anyone who thinks that passing gas, if you will, is inappropriate or disrespectful. Anyone who forces you to hold in the cheese is a sadist. Sometimes, you just gotta relieve the tension. Especially in front of your significant other. And if they can’t handle the heat, kick them outta the kitchen asap. That being said, let her rip. Treat yoself.
