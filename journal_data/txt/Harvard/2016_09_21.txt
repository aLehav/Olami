After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colombian cartoonist Javier Mallarino, protagonist of Juan Gabriel Vásquez’s “Reputations,” dominates his field: Powerful people fear his caricatures, average citizens know his name, and his country has honored him with its highest national award. In retrospect, the 65-year-old Mallarino seems to have built a respectable reputation and lived a respectable life. The day after the Colombian national award ceremony, however, a young woman named Samantha Leal comes to Mallarino’s Bogotá studio seeking to clarify a dark memory that occurred there decades ago. Her questions about that afternoon, which cemented Mallarino’s reputation and destabilized Leal’s life, force Mallarino to reassess the value and meaning of his entire illustrious career.
Although the novel’s premise seems too broad and heady to handle well in such a slim volume, the potent efficiency of Vásquez’s prose allows him to satisfyingly delve into all its themes. In a story spanning only two days of plot-time, Mallarino and the reader successfully confront questions such as: Should one be moral if one’s surroundings require amorality to survive? What are our responsibilities in wielding power? Who deserves the power to judge, or to dictate which truth the world remembers? Is it acceptable to claim knowledge of such subjective concepts as memories and truth? Does absolute truth—or only its consequences—matter?
The exceptionally forceful and incisive language in “Reputations” stands out as one of the novel’s most salient elements. Vásquez’s prose, as translated by Anne McLean, assuredly guides the reader from one sentence to the next with inexorable momentum. A combination of violence, sexuality, and evocations of untamed nature saturates the writing’s figurative expressions; every description heightens the novel’s tense atmosphere and looming sense of self-conflict. A seat belt crosses a woman’s breast “like a hunter’s quiver.” Reporters’ hungry pens are “erect like phalluses.” A receipt becomes tangled in a jacket pocket’s loose threads like “a fish in seaweed.” Vásquez also manages to adopt the keen eye of a cartoonist, seeing inside mechanisms and underneath bones. When Mallarino looks at his watch, for example, he does not simply read the time: He notes the “the angle of the watch hands turned down in reproach.” And the watch does not simply sit on his wrist, but rather “[rests] with the dial… at the prominence at the end of the ulna, the half sphere of bone that some people touch when they’re worried.”
Every individual in the small cast of Mallarino’s life, in fact, seems to be just as sharply reflective and clear-eyed as the cartoonist; when needed, their conversations comprise eloquent turns of phrase and monologues few people would utter spontaneously. Vásquez authoritatively wields his characters’ dialogue and the free indirect discourse of his close third-person perspective to directly express pieces of his own wisdom. A lesser writer might alienate readers through these techniques, making the characters flat or the story narrative unbearably pedantic—but Vásquez’s view of the world is so clear and compelling that he avoids both pitfalls. Just a few sentences, like elegant strokes of an India-ink pen, suffice to capture the essence of individuals, humanity, nations, and emotions. Vásquez writes of Rodrigo Valencia, the executive editor of the newspaper at which Mallarino works: “[His] voice was guttural and deep, one of those voices that give orders naturally, or whose demands are accepted without a fuss. He knew it; he’d grown accustomed to choosing the words that best suited his voice.” “A child’s memory is made of plasticine,” Leal says ruefully; “Forgetfulness was the only democratic thing in Colombia,” thinks Mallarino. These aphoristic moments embody the purpose of literature: to recreate the world in a way most of us do not possess the experience or insight to clearly see.
The book’s spareness and unflinching dissection of its own elements lead naturally to a comparison with caricature. “Life turns us into caricatures of ourselves,” Mallarino says during his award acceptance speech, at a moment in which he himself is acts out the caricature of a grandiose, eminent artist. “Reputations” could be both a powerfully told story and an irreverent self-effacement of the story medium itself, of any attempt at all, whether Mallarino’s or Vásquez’s, to capture anything resembling the truth. Despite the novel’s distrust of representation and memory, however, and despite the central themes of shortcomings and deception, “Reputations” feels driven by some terrific moral engine—or, at least, by the belief in or astounding illusion of one. The conviction with which Vásquez writes his characters and world ultimately creates the sense that perhaps, somewhere, a golden absolute exists. Somewhere—most likely, it seems, in Vásquez’s pen-—there is a semblance of surety, of understanding, of a way forward and upward and beyond.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every so often, my peers express concern that the Army may stifle my “intellectual independence” or “make a robot” of me. Personally, their concerns concern me little. After all, I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of operating as part of a large, well-oiled machine. Individual strength pales in comparison to that of a group.
Nevertheless, I understand why my colleagues fear for my individuality. Marching to the beat of a cadence, running in formation, wearing a uniform, and losing my hair all seem emblematic of the government’s attempt to erase my identity. Some worry that ROTC hinders my Harvard experience by providing me with a set of values that run contrary to those of a self-respecting scholar.
However, Harvard has its share of groupthink as well. A disproportionate number of our students come from the Northeast, and a large percentage hail from America’s more privileged upper class. Many come from a long lineage of educated professionals; to them, college was simply the next natural step after high school.
More importantly, the majority of students on our campus share a similar drive: the desire to leave a legacy. Our administrators only encourage our relentless pursuit of success. Every day, we’re inundated by emails and speeches outlining how we’re somehow an integral part of America’s future. We’re told that we’re the spearhead of tomorrow’s social change, creating the illusion that success will befall us wherever we go.
Thus, our diversity is minimized by our assumedly shared thirst for success. We drown ourselves in unnecessary work, partake in an ungodly number of extracurricular activities, and feel pressured to prolong conversations with professionals that frankly don’t spark our interest. We inadvertently compare our summer experiences amongst ourselves and unintentionally push one another to constantly fret about our future. As a result, our alleged emphasis on individual development instead becomes a narrow quest to impress (and sometimes deceive) our peers and ourselves. Soon we become nothing more than a walking resume.
In comparison, it’s not as if the Army is America’s last true bastion of individual freedom either. As any sociologist would gladly explain, the devaluation of the self remains a core component of most military training. As stated in the Soldier’s Creed, one’s mission and comrades always come before the self. Additionally, the Army has its own share of overly competitive individuals, self-styled star-spangled “patriots” who, in their attempts to impress our superiors, regularly assume command even when no one wants them to. Their cheesy attempts to emulate Captain America in both posture and dialogue earn them few friends and fewer followers.
However, the Army has exposed me to what I consider a far more diverse and accurate representation of the American experience than Harvard has. During my past two summer training sessions, I’ve enjoyed the company of crocodile farmers, raccoon hunters, architects, conspiracy theorists, Slovak sergeants, and cannibal boars.
Through summer training I’ve had the pleasure of arguing with rural anarchists, urban ultra-conservatives, and a Puerto Rican socialist. Furthermore, whereas most students come to Harvard as part of their lifelong pursuit of success, I’ve heard a whole host of reasons given for joining the military. Some seek a new beginning; others search an escape from boredom. A few desire glory, while others crave social mobility and the benefits that accompany members of the uniformed services. A significant portion simply think they’re doing the right thing.
Thus, despite the uniforms and exposed scalps, the Army has opened my mind to a greater portion of the American experience than I would have ever obtained through my studies alone. Ultimately, I’m not afraid of any one organization making a robot of me. After all, both Harvard and the Army have their share of automatons. If anything, my experience with ROTC has introduced me to America’s (as well as Slovakia’s, but that’s a story for another time) strange array of forgotten individuals.
And who knows? Maybe my choice to join the Army will come at the cost of other pursuits. Maybe ROTC has led me away from countless opportunities only Harvard had to offer. Regardless, the Army offered me its own invaluable reward, one I only recently realized: a chance to tell the stories of countless individuals worth remembering, stories that compose the full American experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On my desk sits a copy of a photograph published last May in the Boston Globe. Outside Mass. Hall, a young woman stands amid a crowd of students protesting the newly announced College policy on single-gender social organizations. The sign she carries proclaims: I SHOULD’VE GONE TO BRYN MAWR.  The point, I assume, was that I did go to Bryn Mawr—long before this student was even born.
When I arrived excited to begin my freshman year in the fall of 1964, everything at Bryn Mawr was open to me. Every space, every opportunity, every dream. Had I entered Radcliffe at the same time, things would have been quite different. (And it is worth noting that I could not have applied to Princeton or Yale at all.) A quota system for admissions set the ratio of Radcliffe women to Harvard men at one to four, so I would have been in a distinct female minority. The right to live or even eat in the River Houses belonged exclusively to men. Women were not permitted in Lamont Library. There were only two tenured women, an anthropologist and an astronomer, in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In all probability, I would never have had a female professor to help me see myself in her image—with a Ph.D. and a future in academic life. Instead, I attended a college where I was not a second-class citizen.
In the past half century, both men and women—beginning with Radcliffe president Mary Bunting in the 1960s—have worked steadily to eliminate barriers to full citizenship for women at Harvard, ending admissions quotas, establishing co-residence, and opening to women Lamont Library, Commencement, the Faculty Club, the Society of Fellows, the Alumni Association, deanships, University professorships, the Governing Boards, and the presidency. The legal merger of Radcliffe and Harvard did not occur until 1999, and it was only then that undergraduate women no longer received letters of admission to Radcliffe and no longer had Radcliffe inscribed on their diplomas.
This long path was not smooth or easy. In the 1960s, President Bunting’s vision of merging Harvard and Radcliffe into a fully co-educational institution was stymied by the Radcliffe board of trustees. When women at last took up residence in the Yard, one Harvard alumnus proclaimed, “Civilization is dead.” Professor Katharine Park ’72 has described the harassment she experienced when she moved into Winthrop House and men regularly expressed their displeasure by urinating against her door. But it was in fact often Radcliffe that put the brakes on the integration of women undergraduates into Harvard life, regarding the continuing existence of the college as a necessary “haven from the male-dominated hurly-burly of life at Harvard.” Even with the merger signed, some Radcliffe alumnae still feared and opposed the formal end of Radcliffe College, which they believed had ensured that “undergraduate women at Harvard would always have a place, if not a room, of their own.”
But, in the eyes of many at both Harvard and Radcliffe, separate had implied and embodied unequal. Their goal had long been to enable women to claim their rightful place in the “hurly-burly,” to emerge from a room of their own to be part—to borrow the words of the current Broadway blockbuster “Hamilton”—of the “room where it happens.” Opening such rooms to all has been a goal not just for my presidency but for my life.
The policy on single-gender social organizations Harvard College announced last May is intended as another step in the long and historic movement to ensure that opportunities central to Harvard undergraduate life are not limited by accident of birth, but open to every student. I want all undergraduates to have the experience of full citizenship and to be able to do so in the world of unparalleled intellectual, social, and cultural resources that is Harvard.
I am glad I went to Bryn Mawr, but I want all 6,696 of you—now and 50 years from now—to be glad you went to Harvard. I want Harvard to nurture the belief that you never should settle for second-class citizenship—or for an identity fashioned out of the arbitrary exclusion of others. That is the direction in which Harvard has been evolving for more than half a century. Let us do our part to complete the work.
Drew G. Faust is the President of Harvard University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past year has witnessed tremendous and rapid changes to Harvard Square, with the beginning of the renovation of the Smith Campus Center and the closures of various restaurants and businesses along Mass. Ave. The new academic year has seemingly failed to halt the momentum of these alterations, with proposals floated in recent weeks by both the city of Cambridge and landlords to renovate various buildings in the Square. Both of these plans, however, have been met with vocal opposition by members of the wider Cambridge community, who seek to protect the historic nature of the Out of Town News kiosk and the Curious George store that fronts the intersection of JFK Street and Brattle Street. Partly in response to the aforementioned closures and also in response to the plans proposed by Equity One—the real estate investment firm that owns the building—to turn the Curious George store into an atrium and add two further stories, the Cambridge City Council is considering changes to zoning regulations to provide the city with more oversight to new developments in the Square.
It is undoubtedly true that change is vital to urban centers as a vehicle for regeneration, progress, and innovation. Though blockading change solely for sentimental purposes is misguided and shirks the need for progress, it is equally important to maintain the singular identity of Harvard Square and its surrounding area. Furthermore, given that the Square is the venue for the day-to-day lives of many Cantabrigians, respectful and democratic debate over proposed changes is essential.
Much of the value and charm of the Square derives from the nature of the businesses and restaurants that currently populate it, and from its accessibility to Cantabrigians, Bostonians, and other locals, as well as to tourists from around the world. The Curious George store—as just one example—is a cherished landmark of the Square, as are the various other small restaurants and local shops. New developments and renovations to the infrastructure in the Square run the risk of raising rents beyond what is affordable to these businesses. Sacrificing local institutions in favor of big, outside corporations runs counter to the Square’s distinct character, which, in conjunction with the University itself, makes the Harvard area such an important landmark.
Though accessibility may be an area in which the Square gains from modifications to its buildings and businesses, we are still concerned about the extent to which the Square has become unfriendly to the small, iconic businesses that have populated the area for decades. Ideally, these institutions would make strides toward greater accessibility as we work to preserve the traditions, institutions, and unique character that define Harvard Square.

“In the syllabus I have to declare quite categorically that any student who voluntarily engages in a knife fight in the course of the term will receive an F. That’s the only blanket grading rule that I have.”
Assistant Professor in the History of Science Matthew H. Hersch's office is filled with, among other things, a life-sized astronaut cut-out, a model spaceship, and a cardboard bazooka. His knife-fighting rule is based on his extensive knowledge of combat.
“No one ever wins in a knife fight, and you can’t tell the difference between the person who won a knife fight and the person who lost a knife fight when you’re done with it,” Hersch says.
The knife-fighting stipulation appears in the syllabus of History of Science 182: “An American Way of War: Technology and Warfare,” which Hersch is teaching for the first time. The course is an atypical one for the Harvard course catalog, which seldom features offerings on the nuts and bolts of warfare.
“Courses on [technological history] should be part of the rich tapestry that is undergraduate education at Harvard,” says Hersch, who aims to provide an opportunity for students to learn about a topic highly relevant to real-world affairs.
The course has unconventional elements beyond its knife-fighting rules. On the first day of class, for instance, Hersch demonstrated how one might load a musket while riding a horse.
Hersch jokes that his hands-on approach does have its downsides.
“One of the problems associated with this course is that I keep acquiring things—like that helmet there,” he says, pointing to some camouflaged headgear on one of his many bookshelves, “and I have no place to put them.” Indeed, at the beginning of our chat, Hersch had to move a large model battleship off his desk in order to make space for some of my things.
Out of necessity, much of this military miscellanea consists of models as opposed to real weaponry.
“The Commonwealth of Massachusetts makes it extremely difficult for me, for very good reason, to use actual weapons in class for demonstrations,” he says, opening up a large trunk filled to the brim with mock weaponry made specially for the class.
Though the props are fun, Hersch uses them to relay a serious message. “The ships and the occasional hats and the costumes are very important aspects of our story for increasing memory retention and for illustrating points, but once I get students in the classroom, there are a lot of really meaty issues that we get to have an opportunity to discuss,” Hersch explains. “Nothing is ever as it seems.”
Hersch says facing these issues can even become “emotionally draining” by semester’s end.
“We’re forced in the course to often confront a lot of often very ugly things,” Hersch says. “I believe in national defense. I have always considered myself a patriot, but the business of defending yourself can be an ugly, difficult business.”
To that end, Hersch spends much of the course trying to “shed the romanticism and fantasies” of war. He emphasizes, among other subjects, the difficulties of marksmanship, the extreme discomfort of serving in a submarine, and the struggles of veterans reintegrating into everyday society after serving. “I like to confront these sort of mythologies, not because I don’t love our country, but because I love it as much as I do,” Hersch says. “I think one thing that makes our society terrific is the freedom and the willingness we have to truly know ourselves.”
History of Science 182 is just one of six new courses on the history of technology, with a focus on material culture, that Hersch is in the process of introducing. He is also helping develop a new concentration track entitled Technology, Information, and Society, which he hopes will “give people the opportunity to understand the technological world and make thoughtful and reasoned arguments about it.”
As for the knife fight? His first piece of advice is to “turn around and run the other way as fast as you possibly can,” but, if pushed, he does have a game plan. Sadly, though, he reserves those “secrets for people who take the class.”
“I guess you’ll just have to enroll,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The committee tasked with implementing the College’s new policy penalizing unrecognized single-gender social groups will craft regulations that could pave the way for a formal relationship between Harvard and private student organizations that do have gender-neutral membership, according to the committee’s newly-launched website.
The group is charged with, among other tasks, “out[lining] the expectations and principles that would characterize a formal relationship between private, gender-inclusive social organizations and Harvard College,” according to the website, “[l]eaving open the possibility of defining a new category” of student groups.
Douglas Melton, a Faculty Dean of Eliot House and a University professor, and Kay K. Shelemay, a professor in the Music and African American Studies departments, will chair the  committee, according to a College-wide email sent Tuesday afternoon from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. 
The group, to be composed of students, staff, and faculty members, will offer recommendations about the extensive logistics of implementing the new policy—which starting with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender social organizations from leadership positions in student groups and top fellowships—by the end of the spring semester.
The committee’s full membership is still undecided; students will be selected through a nomination process. Khurana’s email did not name other faculty set to serve.
Over the course of the year, the committee may hold “town halls, focus groups, and/or solicitation of information from various community stakeholders,” according to the group’s website.
Khurana’s email outlined three broad questions the committee will consider. First, the committee will determine “what leadership roles and endorsements are affected by the policy.” The committee will also develop recommendations for how student organizations “fulfill the expectations of inclusive membership practices.”  Lastly, the committee will decide how the College should “handle transgressions” of the policy.
The committee will also develop “a comprehensive communications and outreach plan” to explain the new policy and its enforcement details to students.
Implementing the College’s wide-ranging policy is sure to be an extensive undertaking. Each year, scores of students apply for the fellowships affected by the policy—like the Rhodes Scholarship and Fulbright fellowships—and hundreds of recognized student groups elect leaders in and outside of of single-gender social organizations.
Melton and Shelemay’s committee will have to decide whether, and if so, how, the College will investigate cases in which a student group names a member of a single-gender club to its leadership.
The committee will also convene amid continued criticism from alumni, faculty, and students.
While prominent former administrators, national media outlets, and hundreds of women have made their displeasure with the sanctions known, the policy has its supporters among certain varsity coaches, members of Harvard’s highest governing body, various students, and a former Massachusetts Governor (and one-time member of the all-male Fly Club) Deval J. Patrick ’78.
What’s more, a faculty motion set to be considered in the coming weeks could cast a pall over the implementation committee’s work, especially if Former Dean of the College and opponent of the policy Harry R. Lewis ’68 is correct in asserting that a motion approved by members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences could override the College’s sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Angelina R. Massa ’18 might not be running students through SAT vocabulary lists, but she will be running 67 Mount Auburn Street next year.
Massa, who is currently managing director of the Harvard Student Agencies’ tutoring agency for high school students, will begin her one-year term as president of the business on February 1, 2017.
HSA, founded in 1957 and run entirely by students, now employs over 500 undergraduates and consists of 15 agencies, from laundry services for Harvard students to publishing.
Outgoing president Stephen Xi ’17 said he was enthusiastic about Massa’s upcoming presidency, on which a board of undergraduates, faculty members, and alumni voted confidentially last week. Matthew M. Hawkins ’18, current managing director, was the runner-up.
“I’m really excited for Angelina. She’s going to be a fantastic president,” Xi said.
Massa began her career at HSA as a tutor during her freshman spring.  By sophomore fall, she had been promoted to a manager of the tutoring agency, and the next semester she became the managing director of the entire tutoring agency.
Dominique Sanders ’17, current HSA vice president, said Massa is an example of sustained commitment to the organization.
“Something that’s really great about Angelina is that she had a lot of upward mobility in HSA,” Sanders said. “I think that really speaks to the opportunities that students have at HSA to become involved in the organization.”
After deciding to run for president in early August, Massa met with all 30 current HSA managers to learn more about each agency. The past few years, she has seen the tutoring agency grow rapidly and plans to expand the entire agency as president.
“Tutoring is the third largest and fastest growing agency in HSA,” Massa said. “So I want to take that growth, learn what’s working there, and make it company wide.”
She cited a recent collaboration with Computer Science 50 staff as another example of recent growth.
“We recently partnered with CS 50, and we share a fourth floor office with the CS 50 TFs,” she said. “When they came in, they redesigned the whole office—bean bags and everything. So that’s been fun for us.”
Massa also wants to foster a tight-knit working environment like the one she experienced while working this summer as the managing director of the tutoring agency. She said she enjoyed attending weekly barbecues and bonding activities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 21, 2016, at 10:10 p.m.
A sophomore hopeful of joining the Porcellian Club may have expected some big changes to the club’s punch process this year. Last April, the club privately committed to opening its punch—a club-specific term for the weeks-long process of recruiting new members.
When this fall’s invitations to the first punch event arrived, though, they looked just as they do every year. Cards handwritten in green ink and slid under the doors of a select group of sophomore men—not the entire class—requested “the pleasure of [their] company” at the Cambridge Skating Rink.
Nowhere did the invitations mention that this year’s punch was supposed to be “open.”
The club, it seems, is testing new definitions for what it means to turn a centuries-old selective process inclusive.
Unlike the all-male A.D. club, which heavily publicized its own open punch with advertisements and an email blast, the Porcellian took a far less public approach to advertising.
Though they may have had trouble finding any details, interested sophomores who had not received an invitation were, in fact, welcome to attend the PC’s first punch event, according to a member of the club familiar with this year’s punch.
The member said some men who were not invited did participate in the event, either telephoning the club beforehand to express their interest or simply showing up at the event after learning the details from invited friends.
Graduate president of the Porcellian David T. Lawrence ’67 declined to comment on the punch; undergraduate leader Johann F. Colloredo-Mansfeld ’17 did not respond to a request for comment.
The Porcellian’s move suggests varying definitions of what constitutes an open selection process on a campus increasingly wary of perceived social exclusivity.
The Sablière society, which this year ran an open punch for Harvard women with the aim of going gender-neutral next fall, intended to distribute a physical invitation to every sophomore woman at the College, according to an early September interview with undergraduate president Reva Nohria ’17. The currently all-female Seneca,  meanwhile, also planned to widely publicize, as it does every year, its open recruitment process, which this year will be gender neutral.
Many of the recent moves to open punch were motivated, at least in part, by a new College policy which, starting with the Class of 2021, will penalize student involvement in single-gender social organizations. The Porcellian Club was one of the more public opponents against administrative involvement in the Harvard’s unrecognized single-gender final clubs, with the club’s former graduate board president releasing a controversial statement against the College’s efforts to urge the clubs to go co-ed. Later that month, the Porcellian sent Khurana a statistical analysis questioning a Harvard report that associated final clubs with greater risks of sexual assault.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has started to narrow its list of candidates to replace Stephen Blyth as CEO of Harvard Management Company and has at least two higher education investment veterans among potential candidates for the position, according to a story in the Wall Street Journal.
Amy C. Falls, the chief investment officer at Rockefeller University who currently sits on HMC’s Board of Directors, and N.P. Narvekar, Columbia University’s investment head, are being considered to manage Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment, according to the WSJ. Representatives for Narvekar declined to comment for this story, and Falls could not be reached for comment.
Blyth’s tenure ended this summer when he took a then-temporary medical leave of absence and eventually resigned from his post. When he ascended to the head of HMC in September 2014, Blyth had launched an effort to regain Harvard’s competitive edge in endowment investing and match returns of peer institutions like Yale, Stanford, and Princeton, who have recently outperformed Harvard.
Now, the University finds itself again searching for a new executive and winning investment strategy during a year that experts are saying could spell trouble for Harvard’s and other university endowments. In a statement, Harvard spokesperson David J. Cameron said “there is an active search underway for a new head of the Harvard Management Company, and there are a number of excellent prospective candidates.” He did not confirm that specific candidates were being considered.
According to the WSJ, Harvard was considering seven people for the position earlier this month, and winnowed the list down this week. Seth Alexander and Neal F. Triplett—who direct MIT’s and Duke’s endowment investments, respectively—both passed on the job, the WSJ reported.
While Robert A. Ettl, an HMC executive since 2008, has served as the Management Company’s interim CEO since May, experts say turnover and discontinuity among executives could muddle the firm’s investment strategies. HMC had two CEOs in the first 31 years of its history; the position has changed hands three times in the past 11 years alone.
“They’re coming into a portfolio that’s had five different chefs in the kitchen, six, seven, all trying to cook the same dish,” said Charles A. Skorina, who manages a firm that recruits financial executives. “So they’ve got a mess on their hands.”
Blyth unveiled his vision for HMC’s future in a letter to shareholders released alongside the FY 2015 results, including a turn away from traditional siloed allocation and plans to tie compensation to the fund’s overall performance. But when the new CEO is named, some experts said, those plans could change dramatically.
“Ultimately the new people start with a clean state, and any new manager typically has a grace period to unwind some of the errors of their predecessor,” said David L. Yermack ’85, a professor of finance at New York University. “I think they’ve had a lot of bad luck, frankly. They never intended to be changing managers as quickly as they are. Whoever comes in next, I think there’d be a mutual expectation that they’d be there for at least 10, 15 years.”
In the recent past, searches for new HMC CEOs have lasted months: When Mohamed A. El-Erian resigned after only one year leading the company in 2007, Harvard spent more than six months looking for a new CEO in Jane L. Mendillo. Harvard spent about three months searching for Mendillo’s replacement after she resigned in 2014; according to the WSJ, Narvekar was considered for the position but ultimately withdrew his candidacy.
In the last few years, Harvard’s endowment has struggled to keep pace with returns at peer schools like Yale, Princeton, and MIT. During fiscal year 2015, Yale, Princeton, and MIT returned 11.5 percent, 12.7 percent, and 13.2 percent, respectively, on their endowments; Harvard’s investment pool grew 5.8 percent. University President Drew G. Faust said last year that the endowment’s performance was concerning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Relocated out of the Smith Campus Center amidst ongoing construction, the College’s Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors are bringing their condoms and peer counseling resources to campus dining halls.
While SHARC in the past has typically offered drop-in advising every night, renovations to the Smith Center—which houses Harvard University Health Services—have forced the group to adapt with new initiatives and outreach in the Houses as they await a new interim location.
Other health resources have also been forced to move around during the construction, which is set to last through summer of 2018, including the temporary relocation of Harvard University Health Services’ after hours urgent care to the Law School’s Pound Hall on nights and weekends.
Despite the potential for inconvenience, SHARC co-Director Jamie S. Tanzer ’17 said going on the road has allowed the group to think about new avenues for engaging with students.
“It’s actually been a great opportunity for us to sort of consider some new ways that we can reach more students on campus and think about education and outreach that we haven’t been doing as much of,” Tanzer said.
SHARC has been holding office hours in dining halls across campus during dinner and brain breaks. Along with dining hall office hours, the organization has piloted other initiatives like hosting a table at a September Club 1636 event in Tasty Burger.
“This is one of the things that we brainstormed when thinking about in this time period when we don’t have a concrete space,” Tanzer said, referring to the dining hall office hours. “What’s a way to make sure that our presence is still felt on campus?”
The past year has been a busy one for HUHS. In total, 26 different units within HUHS have been forced to move since last October, according to HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira, who emphasized the difficulty of operating these medical services during the Smith Center construction.
“So you can just imagine, right, trying to continue to run a medical service [while] simultaneously moving people around,” Barreira said. “And I’m not just talking about a single individual, I’m talking [about] whole units moving different places and back again. So it’s been pretty disruptive.”
At least for SHARC, there will be some measure of permanence amidst all the change, as the organization is currently in the process of finishing the search for a temporary office, and Tanzer is hopeful of finding one in the “next couple of weeks.”
“We are just looking for places that are conveniently accessible to the most people,” she said. “We have a couple of leads that we’re continuing with, but we haven’t completely set what our new location or our new hours will be yet.”
SHARC is still currently staffing QuadTalk, a joint initiative by multiple peer counseling groups to expand mental health resources to the Radcliffe Quadrangle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 is becoming increasingly vocal in his opposition to the College’s new policy that will penalize student involvement in single-gender social organizations.
In the past week, Lewis has spoken out against the policy to students in his computer science class, faculty colleagues in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Faculty Council, and to the public in a blog post that decried the policy as “the height of arrogance.” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, through College spokesperson Rachael Dane, declined comment on any of Lewis’s recent criticisms.
The policy in question, which, starting with the Class of 2021, will bar members of single-gender social organizations from College endorsement for top fellowships, varsity captaincies, and many leadership positions, was announced in May after almost a year of meetings and reports on the topic.
In announcing the policy, Khurana wrote that “Harvard has the obligation to establish the general regulations and standards governing Harvard students, faculty, and staff that are consistent with our educational philosophy.” University President Drew G. Faust has continued to defend the new policy in recent interviews and a video feature for The Atlantic.
Lewis’s opposition to the policy first became public when The Crimson published a private letter that Lewis sent to Khurana. In the 3-page letter, Lewis called on Khurana to roll back the sanctions, which he said broke “dangerous new ground” in administrative oversight of undergraduates’ lives.
Lewis’s recent ramp-up in anti-policy rhetoric comes ahead of an Oct. 4 Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ meeting in which the Faculty could vote on a motion submitted by Lewis and 11 colleagues that resolves that the College “shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.” Lewis and other signatories of the letter believe the motion, if passed, would strike down the administration’s sanctions given that the University’s statutes put the Faculty in direct control of the College.
While FAS administrators have declined to comment on the potential power of a successful motion, members of this year’s Faculty Council, which decides the agenda for faculty meetings, met with Lewis and co-signatories Margo I. Seltzer and Richard F. Thomas last week.
Though Lewis said Faculty Council rules prohibit him from characterizing what other people in the meeting said, he wrote in an email to the Crimson that he “asked the members of the Faculty Council how they would feel if the new policy applied to faculty as it applied to students.”
“Would that give you any discomfort? If yes, why would we make this the rule for students?” Lewis wrote.
More a dozen members of the Faculty Council did not respond or declined request for comment on the meeting. FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to comment.
The same day Lewis met with the Faculty Council, Wednesday of last week, he also polled students on their views of the policy in Computer Science 121, the large lecture course Lewis teaches.
In an account of the poll later published on his blog, which has been inactive since 2015, Lewis wrote that he first asked any students supportive of the new policy to hum audibly, next asking students who opposed the policy to hum. Lewis wrote that he employed the humming technique to achieve a rough consensus while maintaining student anonymity.
“The consensus was there and it was overwhelmingly negative,” Lewis wrote.
Sathvik R. Sudireddy ’19, who attended Thursday’s lecture, said he thought “a lot of people hummed against it” also and that Lewis seemed “satisfied with the results” of his survey.
While Lewis acknowledged the sample was far from representative, he wrote that he was still surprised the class was not in favor of the policy.
Two days after posting about the CS121 straw poll, Lewis published another post on his blog that related to the final club sanctions. The post, which ranged in topic from Godwin’s law and Nazism to the Communist witch hunts that dogged Harvard in the 1950’s to the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe, again criticized the new policy.  Lewis was particularly critical of what he saw as the scant student feedback the administration solicited in crafting the policy.
“Harvard’s confidence in the judgment of its students is at a modern low—they were not even consulted,” Lewis wrote, pointing to the dearth of town halls and House discussions on the issue before the policy was announced.
In announcing the policy, Khurana wrote that it was developed “with careful deliberation.”
“Over the past two years, we have engaged with students, including those who are members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations,” Khurana wrote at the time.
On Tuesday, Khurana officially announced the implementation committee—which will include students, faculty, and staff—that will spearhead the rollout of the new policy.

Yale Law School Professor Stephen L. Carter argued the relevance of slavery in the United States by addressing its impact on the law in the first installment of his W.E.B. Du Bois Lecture Series on Tuesday.
The lecture was the first of a three part installment called “Blackness and the Legal Imagination” hosted by the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research.
In his speech, titled “Thinking Property,” Carter explored the notion that slaves could simultaneously be treated as both property and as human beings—a paradox that Carter said is difficult to resolve.
According to Carter, laws regarding slavery were often decided arbitrarily, and slaves were left without many legal rights. In early common law, slaves largely lacked “legal personality,” which Carter defined as the ability to form contracts, own property, and act autonomously.
Carter said racial advocates often face criticism for continuing to argue the relevance of slavery during the discussion of contemporary race relations.  However, according to Carter, the legacy of slavery has shaped the American political, social, and legal landscapes in significant ways.
“A lot of the things we see in the news today, a lot of the things that characterize an American...are things that have their origins not too much [with] slavery but rather in attitudes that developed in politics, and particularly in law, over a very long period beginning with the enforced arrival of enslaved Africans,” he said.
In her introduction of Carter, Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow recalled her memories attending Yale Law School with Carter, after which the two would both go on to clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Minow compared Carter’s reflections on his experiences with affirmative action to Du Bois’s double consciousness of the Negro and American identities.
Many who attended the lecture felt Carter’s message was particularly relevant.
“As Professor Carter today mentioned, history repeats itself,” said Anthea Meng, a visiting fellow of the African and African-American Studies department. “Some of the problems still remain today, so I think there’s this kind of academic turn of interpreting history.”
Carter will continue the W.E.B. Du Bois series with his second lecture “The Invisible Race” on Wednesday and his third “The Visible Future” on Thursday in the Barker Center.

With just 47 days until voters cast their ballots, audience members packed the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum to watch journalistic veterans Ann Compton, visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics, and Bob Schieffer, former moderator of CBS’ Face the Nation and now fellow at the Shorenstein Center, discuss the media’s role in this election cycle.
The event, moderated by Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center, was entitled “Media, Politics & Power: Trump, Clinton & the 2016 Election.” Mele noted that Compton and Schieffer have important insights on presidential debates, with Compton having served as a panelist on two and Schieffer having moderated three.
According to the panelists, the first presidential debate, just days away, is a crucial event for both the candidates and the moderators.
Schieffer said this presidential campaign has highlighted the importance of television news because of Republican candidate Donald J. Trump’s media tactics.
“He just realized that if you called a certain number of television programs, and agreed to be on them, that two or three would invite you to be on,” he said. “While [the candidates] were all going through all this old-fashioned kind of politics, he was just getting out there and getting on television.”
Schieffer cautioned the moderators against becoming part of the show during the debates.
“People go to baseball game to see the baseball players, they don't go to see umpire. And you’re the umpire,” he said.
He also urged the moderators to challenge the candidates when they give misleading statements, though he maintained the chief fact-checkers should be the candidates themselves.
When pushed by an audience member about the media’s treatment of Trump, Schieffer disagreed with the notion that the media has not been tough enough on Trump. He specifically cited David Fahrenthold’s ’00 reporting in the Washington Post, as well as Maggie Haberman and David Sanger’s ‘82 interview on foreign policy with Trump in the New York Times as exemplary pieces of journalism.
Compton, meanwhile, argued that new technology has also played a unique role in this election cycle.
“We have put the tools of journalism in the hands of the candidates themselves,” she said.
Because of the candidates’ increased control over their message, Compton and Schieffer agreed that the media must educate citizens in addition to informing them.
Audience member Abigail N. Burke ’19 said the talk provided her with new perspectives on the media.
“It was interesting to hear about the race from the media's point of view, because we get all of our news through the media.”

With Harvard’s help, grocery chain Trader Joe’s will open a new store in Allston next year at Continuum, a residential and retail complex built on Harvard-owned land.
The store will occupy a 13,000-square foot portion of the ground floor of Continuum, which sits on the corner of North Harvard Street and Western Ave., south of Harvard Stadium. Interested in developing the neighborhood around the University’s developments, Harvard administrators helped alleviate concerns about limited parking to facilitate the store’s arrival.
Joel Sklar, the president of Boston-based real estate developer Samuels & Associates, presented the first details about the new Trader Joe’s to Allstonians at a meeting of the Harvard-Allston Task Force on Monday night. Harvard chose Samuels & Associates to develop the site in 2012.
“When we first came in here we felt there was a need for an anchor, some critical mass of retail here, not just for the building but to create energy on the street,” Sklar said. “We’re thrilled that Trader Joe’s is coming.”
Sklar said Trader Joe’s first came to Samuels and expressed interest in leasing the property from Continuum roughly eight or nine months ago. Negotiations were delayed, however, by concerns over Continuum’s limited parking space, according to Sklar.
After several months of discussions between representatives from Harvard, Samuels, and Trader Joe’s, Harvard agreed to repurpose its landholdings at 175 N. Harvard St., on the former site of the Harvard Ed Portal, as extra parking space to accommodate the increased demand from Trader Joe’s customers, Sklar said.
Harvard has yet to go to the Boston Zoning Board of Appeals to obtain a permit for the new parking area, Sklar added. The University will seek a parking permit in coordination with Trader Joe’s efforts to obtain a liquor permit from the City of Boston for the store.
As Sklar wrapped up his presentation, interim task force chair John A. Bruno gave his own thoughts with cautious optimism.
“This is a wealth of information,” he said. “To some people it may be exciting, to some people not so exciting.”
Benjamin I. Pleat ’17, meanwhile, called the new Trader Joe’s an “amazing” development both for the Allston neighborhood and for Harvard students involved with the Harvard Innovation Lab. The i-lab, the oldest of three entrepreneurial centers Harvard operates in Allston, is on 125 Western Ave., close by Continuum.
“We’re there all the time,” said Pleat, who participates in the i-lab’s Venture Incubation Program. “So it [will be] super convenient for us to literally go right across the street to get a sandwich, get some groceries from Trader Joe’s.”
Pleat also noted that the new Trader Joe’s may help to foster interaction between Harvard affiliates and Allston residents, one of the stated goals driving Harvard’s Allston developments.
“I think what we [will see] is a kind of mixed use,” he said. “I think there will be a really good convergence of residents of the building, [the] general Allston community… I imagine a bunch of start-up students from the i-lab will go there all the time.”
Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote in an emailed statement that “this new retail will increase the vibrancy and vitality of the community and continue to serve the needs of faculty, staff, students, and our neighbors alike.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly six months after a University task force submitted a number of recommendations to combat sexual assault on campus, the College has submitted a plan to address the proposals,  revamped training, and introduced a new policy that will penalize single gender organizations—but many action items are still pending.
Campus discourse over the past year has been dominated by the topic of sexual assault, as administrators responded to high rates of sexual violence on campus and students called on the College to bolster resources and support for victims.
Last September, University President Drew G. Faust sent a University-wide email sharing the results of the sexual climate survey administered over the past spring, which indicated that about a third of female undergraduate respondents reported experiencing some form of sexual assault during their time at the College.
A full year since University President Drew G. Faust called the results of a Harvard-wide campus sexual conduct climate survey “deeply troubling,” the College has implemented some recommendations a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention released in March.
Indeed, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview earlier this month that the College submitted a plan to the task force in response to the report released in March, though that plan has not been made public.
While the survey results and task force recommendations were distributed to the entire University, findings focused heavily on misconduct among undergraduates. The report, for example, wrote that recommendations disproportionately target the College’s students and administrators, citing the school’s residential character and unique social atmosphere.
Since the University released the findings of it sexual assault survey, administrators this fall introduced a mandatory online sexual assault prevention training module. College spokesperson Rachael Dane cited a series of town halls hosted by administrators including Faust and increased staffing in the Office of BGLTQ Student Life as initiatives administrators have also spearheaded in the last year.
Dane also pointed to the historic sanctions Harvard announced last spring, penalizing membership in the College’s unrecognized single gender final clubs and Greek organizations, as a step taken to address sexual harassment and assault. That policy will go into effect beginning with the Class of 2021. Those sanctions have proven controversial, and drawn backlash from across the country. One final club, the Porcellian, commissioned a statistical analysis questioning the connection between sexual assault and clubs.
In an email to undergraduates debuting the policy in May, Faust wrote that Khurana’s policies are meant to tackle gender exclusivity.
The number of reforms made thus far are just a start, Khurana said in an interview earlier this month.
“But I would say that over the coming weeks you will be hearing a lot more,” he said. “This is an ongoing effort of things we will be doing and announcing.”
Several committees at the College are working to further develop sexual assault prevention plans; one recommendation yet to be accepted, for example, is a study of the role of hard alcohol on campus.
One committee, composed entirely of students, provides input to administrators as they process the report.
In the background, the federal Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is still conducting a Title IX investigation into Harvard. That investigation has been ongoing since 2014.

Wednesday marks a year since University President Drew G. Faust unveiled what she called the “anguishing” results of a University-wide survey about the sexual climate on campus. Among other data points, that survey—conducted in the spring of 2015—found that nearly a third of senior undergraduate female respondents who were enrolled in Harvard College had experienced some form of sexual assault while at the College.
When somberly presenting the data to a crowded room at a townhall Sept. 21, 2015, Faust said Harvard’s response to sexual assault was “completely insufficient.”
Since the release of the survey results, Harvard has spent the year doubling down its sexual assault prevention efforts, culminating in a wide-ranging, 20-page report in March that recommended students receive annual sexual assault prevention training and that the University hire a new administrator to take charge of prevention efforts, among other suggestions. The report also lambasted historically all-male final clubs for their “deeply misogynistic attitudes” and said combatting sexual assault on campus could not be done without addressing the organizations.
The College has publicly accepted some recommendations, but not all. And the College, while still under investigation by the federal government for its compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, also faces an ongoing lawsuit with an alumna who charges Harvard administrators mishandled their response to her sexual harassment case.
What follows is a sketch of the past year, one in which Harvard students, faculty, and administrators grappled head-on with the realities and prevalence of campus sexual assault.
A sexual climate survey conducted in conjunction with the American Association of Universities revealed what administrators called a “troubling” climate of sexual misconduct on campus. The survey indicated a widespread lack of knowledge about University processes surrounding reports of sexual harassment or assault, and undergraduate respondents also generally reported they did not have faith in Harvard to respond to offenders.
Faust held a town hall the day the results were released, making clear her concern over the survey’s findings and promising action moving forward.
In mid-February, Cabot House alumna Alyssa R. Leader ’15 filed a lawsuit against Harvard charging the University with mishandling her case of sexual harassment. In the filings, Leader argued that administrators, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, ultimately let the alleged perpetrator live alongside her in Cabot despite her case against him.
Leader ultimately requested both compensation for herself and punitive damages for Harvard, claiming that Cabot House Resident Dean Tiffanie L. Ting not only refused to accommodate Leader after her assault, but actively discouraged her from filing an official report. The lawsuit is ongoing, and the University will go to court soon.
After months of information gathering, a University-wide task force appointed by Faust and charged with crafting recommending  ways to prevent sexual assault on campus submitted its final report. The 20-page report addressed topics ranging from expanded BGLTQ support to the rethinking the College’s alcohol policy, additionally calling on the University to more closely scrutinize the College’s historically all-male final clubs.
Touted as a move to combat gender exclusivity, Faust emailed announced to all undergraduates a historic policy penalizing members of single-gender, unrecognized social groups, such as final clubs and Greek organizations. Effective with the College’s Class of 2021, students involved in such organizations will be ineligible for fellowships, club leadership, and team captaincies. The policy, which has prompted widespread debate, was characterized by some College officials as one to prevent sexual assault in addition to ending gender discrimination.
The College unveiled an online training module for students to complete annually, intended both to inform students of available resources for gender-based harassment and sexual assault and also educate students about Havard policies.
The interactive training, which undergraduates are required to complete by mid-October, complies with recommendations from the University-wide sexual assault prevention task force.
While students voiced praise for the online platform, some noted that the module should not replace frequent and in-person trainings for sexual assault prevention and response. After launching the module, both College Title IX coordinator Emily J. Miller and Khurana noted that more measures for undergraduate sexual assault prevention are soon to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the season opener last Friday, the Harvard football team faced a slew of questions. How would the program rebound after losing a stout senior class? Who would replace two-year starter Scott Hosch at quarterback? Could this year’s Crimson deal with the expectations that come with three straight Ivy titles?
While some uncertainty still lingers, many doubts were silenced last weekend thanks to a 51-21 rout of the Rhode Island.
INTRODUCING JOEY FOOTBALL
Harvard football has had its share of solid quarterbacks. Last year Hosch led the Crimson to a 9-1 record and its first ever three-peat in the Ancient Eight. Before that Connor Hempel recorded 21 touchdowns versus six interceptions in the final 12 games of his career. And a decade before that, Ryan Fitzpatrick commanded Harvard Stadium, captaining the team to an undefeated season in 2004.
Suffice it to say, coach Tim Murphy knows a good playcaller when he sees one.
Before Friday night’s game, quarterback Joe Viviano had never complete a collegiate pass - a fact that many, including this paper, made a point of mentioning. Plagued by injuries throughout his career, the senior made his first start against the Rams.
But if there were any doubts about what he could do, the 6’5” Viviano put them to bed early.
After three-and-a-half quarters, the starter left the game with 290 yards through the air to complement 51 rushing yards. He accounted for four of the Crimson’s seven touchdowns, tossing three and running for one.
“I thought Joe played very well,” coach Tim Murphy said. “[He] has had not only little to no playing time, but he [also] has had very limited practice time…. He’s made the most of the opportunity.”
While quarterback success is nothing new, an interesting contrast emerges when comparing Viviano’s playing style with the strengths of previous playcallers. Neither Hempel nor Hosch surpassed 300 running yards in a season; Viviano is on track to accumulate nearly 500. This mobility gives Murphy more play-calling flexibility and could prove to be a crucial factor in Harvard’s quest for a fourth straight Ivy League title.
When watching Viviano, the on-field comparison that jumps out immediately is Johnny Manziel. Both have a creative ability to extend plays with their feet when protection breaks down.
For instance, take Viviano’s rushing touchdown at the end of the first quarter against Rhode Island. As the pocket collapsed and defenders closed on him, Viviano spun out left but collided with a defender and offensive lineman. He then jumped back, side-stepped another defender, and scampered in for the touchdown. This play was remarkably reminiscent of Manziel, specifically his touchdown pass against Duke in the 2013 Chick-Fil-A Bowl.
“I just try to run the plays the way they’re designed,” Viviano said. “If stuff breaks down, I’ll just try to make a play with my feet. Ideally throw, but if I have to, run.”
SHOTGUN FUN
Running a spread offense is all the rage in football these days. From high school to the NFL, this strategy allows a team to move players out of the box and use the whole field.
But the tactic isn’t news to Harvard football. In fact, Murphy has been running this offense longer than nearly anyone else in the country.
By spreading the field, an offense forces the opposition to stretch its resources thin. More linebackers have to play outside the box, making it easier to run the ball against a lighter defensive front.
In addition, the passing game remains a threat. There are anywhere from two to five receivers on the field at any given time, and even the simplest routes pose significant danger due to the lack of defenders in a given space.
“We’ve been running the up-tempo, no-huddle position probably longer than anyone in the nation,” Murphy said. “The bottom line is, the minute you put the quarterback in a shotgun situation...you don’t have to block as many guys.”
While the spread has clear benefits, it certainly has drawbacks. In the game against Rhode Island, the Harvard offense hardly went under center, even in short-yardage situations. As potent as spread offenses can be, they lack the strength of power formations when a team needs a few feet to convert a late down.
Less than nine minutes into the game, for example, the Crimson faced a fourth-and-one from the Rams’ 32. Although the down marker stood a mere three feet away, the offense elected to snap the back back an extra four or five yards before even thinking about forward progress.
In this case, the playcall didn’t make much of a difference as a Harvard lineman jumped offsides, resulting in a fourth-and-six.
“We don’t pretend to have all the answers,” Murphy said. “But we do what we do.”
AIR TO THE THRONE
Perhaps the most decisive takeaway from Friday night was that Viviano likes two particular receivers a lot. A whole lot.
Sophomore wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley and senior tight end Anthony Firkser each finished with over 100 yards receiving. Shelton-Mosley reached that milestone on nine catches, while Firkser made seven grabs, two of which went for touchdowns.
To put those numbers in perspective, both players alone had more receiving yards than the rest of the Crimson combined.
“It’s pretty clear that they’re both probably my favorite targets to throw to throughout preseason,” VIviano said. “Not that other guys can’t step up...but they’re very reliable guys to go to.”
Reliable might be an understatement. Last season, Shelton-Mosley tallied 589 yards through the air despite starting play as a true freshman. Meanwhile Firkser had tallied 857 yards in his career before Friday, including 372 last season.
If either player enjoys a breakout season, then you can trace the start of dominance to last Friday.

So it's 2 in the afternoon and you're starting to feel kind of drowsy. Maybe it's all of those lectures you've been sitting through, or maybe you went just a little overboard last night at your entryway's kickback. Either way, now you're stuck with what is perhaps the greatest dilemma you will face during your time at Harvard besides whether you should do a thesis or not: to nap, or not to nap? Luckily for you, Flyby has the answer—and it's nowhere near as complicated as Shakespeare's convoluted advice.
Did you...?
...get a solid 8-10 hours of sleep last night?
“I always get the optimal amount of sleep for my health,” said nobody ever But, on the off chance this is you, the overwhelming answer is NO, don't take a nap! You owe it to the rest of us bleary-eyed night owls to make the most of your alert and productive brain. Trust me, you’ll thank us later when you’re relaxing in your bed while your roommates trudge off to Lamont.
...sleep at all last night?
Okay, so you didn’t exactly get your beauty sleep. Was it 5 hours? 2? Either way, you're probably crabby and not thinking very well. You're pretty sure that guy you just said “'Sup” to was actually your professor. In any case, it won't hurt to get a little extra rest before your next class. Napping is definitely the call.
...pull an all-nighter?
You stayed awake all night for a reason, didn't you? Hurry up and finish that assignment. Honestly, are a few more hours awake really going to hurt? But if you pulled more than one consecutive all-nighter (you unnatural creature), then no p-set is worth it. In fact, why are you wasting your time reading this post when you could be hitting the sack?
