No widows appear in the first image of Agnes Varda’s exhibition “Les Veuves de Noirmoutier” (“The Widows of Noirmoutier”) at the Carpenter Center’s Sert Gallery. Instead, just a table, long and bare, stands on an empty beach. Without human presence, the table looks out of place and useless, as if its only purpose were to disrupt the stretched smoothness of the coast. As the widows trickle in and out of the next four photographs, they circle around the table, leaning on it and then looking away, suggesting perhaps that they do not know how to treat the remains of a domestic life.  
Agnes Varda, herself a widow, is a French photographer and filmmaker whose work forms part of the canon of French New Wave Cinema. In 2005, Varda directed a documentary on the French island of Noirmoutier, “Quelques Veuves de Noirmoutier,” a series of interviews with widowed women. That same footage, displaced and rearranged, makes up the exhibition at the Sert Gallery. In the gallery context, these encounters become at once personal and jarring, an intimate look at women to whom death has brought not only grief but also a new identity. 
After the five photographs at the entrance of the gallery, the viewer passes into the main room, where fifteen video screens cover the back wall. Fourteen of these, all featuring interviews with widows, surround one large screen with footage of the same beach scene. The sound of waves permeates the entire gallery, interrupted occasionally by the melancholy note of a violin.
To hear the interviews, the viewer must sit down in one of the fourteen chairs placed in the middle of the gallery. Each chair comes with a set of headphones and a written English translation of the interview (originally in French). Arranged in a square, the pattern of the chairs mirrors the display of the interviews on the wall so that one faces the widow head on. It is as if Varda has invited the viewer to the widows’ table, into the secret realities of their daily lives. Varda never appears on the screen when questioning, so as not to disturb the intimate, seemingly direct conversation between viewer and widow.  
And yet one is aware at all times of the other viewers and their widows. Focus on one screen does not shut out the others. As the viewer absorbs one tale, images from neighboring stories flicker in and out of his sight. The artifacts from one life—a bed, a photograph, a shot of the salt mines—encroach on the account of another. At times, sounds from the big screen break into the widow’s monologue. So while the widows speak of empty houses and long days spent in solitude, they are never alone in Varda’s exhibition. They belong to a collective built from misfortune.  
Throughout the tales and across all screens run images of the landscape of Noirmoutier—flying seagulls, overgrown gardens and fishing boats—rooting the widows’ tales in the story of the island they will never leave. Just as they remain loyal to their husbands, the women remain faithful to the land on which they celebrated their love. Attachment to the land is an extension of their loyalty.
Being by the sea took on special significance for particular widows. A life based on the rhythm of the tides meant a life slowed by long periods of waiting. Their husbands were as tied by the ocean as by their marriage—they were fishermen, boat mechanics, salt miners. The widows waited for days, sometimes months, while their husbands lived with the sea. And still now, each widow waits to be joined with her husband, not by his return but by her death. In the words of one: “It’s long.”

Secretly, society has a fascination with the enigmatic, dynamic, and unreported events of the all-boy prep school. The HRDC’s newest drama, “The History Boys,” rips this mystery wide-open with a witty, yet tense, tale of eight English schoolboys as they prepare for their college entrance exams. As “Oxbridge candidates,” they must face the reality of adulthood, while their flavorful, poetical English professor Mr. Hector fights to protect the boys’ playful youth.Ostensibly, Hector (Ilan J. Caplan ’10) parallels the Mr. Keating of “The Dead Poet’s Society.” But while Keating only provides literature, Hector offers illicit sexual encounters. His inability to distance himself emotionally enables “The History Boys” to dig deeper into the student-teacher relationship, divulging the unspoken sexual tensions that can develop when malleable adolescents love and respect their role models a little too much.This well-cast group of boys quickly traps the audience’s attention with their slapstick humor and catchy one-liners; however, they soon prove to be more than a bunch of goofballs. Each one bright and opinionated, they straddle the line between embracing 1980s counter-culture, and respecting the old-world tradition embedded in British society.Fueling their taste for literature, self-expression, and the corruptible purity of art, Hector declares, “Forget Oxford! Forget Cambridge!” only minutes into the first act. He demands instead that they memorize literature and use that breadth of knowledge as a means to defy all that society expects of them. “You give them an education. I give them a way to resist it!” Hector explains to his fellow teachers.Fascinated by Mr. Hector’s teachings is Mr. Irwin (played by Emerson junior Sean Dalal)—a young, harsh Oxford graduate hired to train the boys for their forthcoming exam. Irwin’s presence in the play also sharpens the distinction between “The History Boys” and “The Dead Poet’s Society.” Although Irwin could easily be portrayed as the stock-character of a dispassionate figure against which the boys may rebel, he actually struggles with personal issues of his own. Hired to be the manifestation of the headmaster’s (James Smith) beliefs and expectations, Irwin is both annoyed and captivated by Hector’s eccentric teachings. However, his own attempts to remain unemotional and detached from the boys fail, and he falls into the same trap as Hector—he can’t help but care for them.Though all the boys are loveable, Stuart Dakin (Noah A. Hoch ’11) stands out as the seductive heartthrob of the show. Representing “class hunks” everywhere, Hoch certainly delivers as the one boy with whom everyone is in love. Hoch successfully maintains an essence of arrogance necessary to his character, causing the teachers, classmates, and audience to fall for him. Flirtatious and brilliant, Dakin recognizes the power he holds over everyone saying, “I never realized how easy it was to make things happen.”Both Caplan and Dalal play off each other well, Caplan as the dramatic artist and Dalal as the straight-suited authority. While Caplan’s utterly vivacious and animated performance deserves many high regards, Dalal’s portrayal of Irwin’s inner turmoil guarded by a severe façade also warrants a great deal of praise. The third teacher of the school is Mrs. Lintott (Alison H. Rich ’09). As the sole female in the cast, Rich certainly holds her own, hitting a homer with an impassioned monologue on women’s lack of recognition in the classroom.Further merits go to David J. Smolinsky ’11, who plays Scripps, the aspiring-writer who narrates the play in the form of a memoir. Yet more of Scripps’ narration would have helped ground the audience’s understanding of the basic plot, points of which were sometimes lost amidst a barrage of historical, literary, and political references delivered in over-practiced British accents. Nevertheless, this does not diminish Smolinsky’s fantastic performance both in the scenes and along the sidelines as the narrator.Highest of all accolades should be awarded to James B. Danner ’12, whose performance as Posner—the “almost-out-of-the-closet” boy completely smitten with Dakin—is both remarkable and memorable. The seeming ease with which he portrayed Posner’s soft-spoken nature and the nuanced rendition of his growing homosexual identity set him apart from the rest of the performers. This high-energy cast gives themselves over to the audience for two full hours as they weave humor, sincerity, and passion into a solemn exposé of the complex male-to-male interactions often imagined to exist at all-boys school. As the college entrance exam draws near, hearts are broken, grown men humiliated, and the unspoken code of conduct and silence is shattered, spewing all secrets right out onto the stage floor.—Staff writer Noel A.

A monster has been gnawing at the avocados, explains the white suburban couple, Clay and Kelly, to Mr. Hadid, the man with an African accent sitting in their living room.  Like their spotless carpet and the shiny flat-screen TV, the couple possess a pristine appearance in “The Pain and the Itch,” which runs until April 4th at the Boston Center for the Arts. But as Clay and Kelly (Joe Lanza and Aimee Doherty) tell their guest (Cedric Lilly) the story of a strange Thanksgiving that begins and ends with the mysterious bites in their avocados, it becomes apparent that there is not just one monster and not just one painful itch in their outwardly perfect lives. While the play’s overarching message about the hypocrisy of white Northeastern liberals becomes overbearing at times, it is not easy either to write or perform a play about intolerance in post-September 11th American culture without becoming too preachy. “The Pain and the Itch” comes close to crossing the line but manages to avoid doing so due to the company’s excellent performance and M. Bevin O’Gara’s subtle direction.“The Pain and the Itch” shows how one family’s secrets can affect the life of a complete stranger. Clay and Kelly invite Mr. Hadid into their home in order to explain, as revealed at the end of the first act, how they have indirectly killed Hadid’s wife. They tell him a story of a family Thanksgiving rife with tension. Clay is hiding his daughter’s mysterious rash from his wife and fighting about the values of his lifestyle with his brother, Cash (Dennis Trainor Jr.). Cash is arguing with his young girlfriend and trying to hide a darker secret from his brother. As the night continues, arguments escalate, a mistaken call to the police is made, Mrs. Hadid dies, and the life of everyone on stage is completely altered. The energy on the stage never falters, from the opening conversation between Clay, Kelly, and their out-of-place guest through the many strange confrontations that occur over the course of their story. There is no weak link in the company; the silent and troubled seven-year-old daughter (Helen Steinman) has a stage presence as forceful as that of Clay’s officious mother (Nancy E. Carroll).  The standout performance, however, is given by Philana Mia as Kalina, the young Eastern European girlfriend of Clay’s obnoxious brother, Cash. Her warm presence onstage allows her to alternate effortlessly between her character’s comedic and serious moments. Kalina is tender and loving, if at times offensive (she makes one particularly awkward comment about exterminating the gypsies, like they did with the Jews). In spite of these moments of bigotry, Mia makes Kalina’s lines the most heartfelt ones in the play.The set, designed by Cristina Todesco, is a beautiful backdrop to the cast’s exceptional performance. Although in the small theatre the audience is already seated close to the action, the detail of the set draws them in as if they were in fact sitting in Clay and Kelly’s living room. Because of the set’s intricacy, the few inconsistencies—such as the fact that the cast drinks water when they are supposedly drinking wine—feel oddly conspicuous.Such inconsistencies are quickly forgotten, however, in the midst of O’Gara’s complex and constantly changing stage pictures. Also thanks to O’Gara’s direction, the transitions between present and past throughout the play are clear and smoothly executed. In one moment, Clay and Kelly are talking to Mr. Hadid about the price of the dinner table, while in the next the audience is transported into the middle of their terrible Thanksgiving dinner.Despite the clarity of these temporal shifts, there are several key plot questions that go unanswered through most of the play, but this ambiguity shapes its tempo. Who or what is eating the avocados? What is the mysterious rash afflicting Kayla? Why did Clay and Kelly invite this man into their home, and why are they telling him the story of their dysfunctional family? These questions drive the action of the play, while the fast pace and constant banter prevent the audience from getting too impatient to learn the answers. More importantly, the play raises a series of questions about white upper-class liberal culture that are never resolved, saving “The Pain and the Itch” from becoming overly pedantic. How long can we keep children safe from the many dangers of the world inside and outside the home? What are the lasting effects of our biases and misjudgments? The audience may find out what has been eating Clay and Kelly’s avocados, but these larger, darker questions have no easy answer.—Staff writer Rachel A.

The agonizing wait is finally over. Last week, the College Events Board announced that pop singer-songwriter Sarah Bareilles and electronic group Ratatat will be performing at Yardfest this year on April 19. Whether the event will be successful has yet to be seen. We hope, however, that the CEB has learned its lesson from the disastrous Girl Talk pep rally this fall.Bareilles and Ratatat are a departure from the series of outdated artists that the CEB has booked over the past couple of years. With Gavin DeGraw and Wu Tang Clan on stage last year, and Third Eye Blind in 2007, many criticized the CEB for selecting artists who were past their primes. Both Ratatat and Bareilles, on the other hand, are up-and-coming performers who, while perhaps less well known, offer an element of freshness that is a welcome change. Bareilles’s career just picked up momentum in late 2007, while Ratatat began its musical ascension in 2004.As for logistics, the CEB seems to be off to a good start. Earlier this year, the organization polled students for their preferences of different artists and music genres and took into account the student body’s opinions when selecting artists. Students following the pop culture scene will enjoy Bareilles’s upbeat singles, and electronic fans can get excited for Ratatat’s innovative mixes. While more high-profile artists might have been preferred over these selections, the choices make sense given CEB’s limited budget.The CEB, however, needs to do more than just polling to redeem itself in the eyes of students after the Girl Talk fiasco. At the Harvard Pep Rally in November, Harvard University Police decided to cut DJ Girl Talk’s concert short when the crowd swarmed a poorly constructed stage. In April, we expect the CEB to do a better job organizing the event, communicating with HUPD, and managing the crowd. One decision we find regrettable is the scheduling of the concert on a Sunday given student work constraints, but we understand that this might have been primarily due to booking conflicts with the artists themselves.Ultimately, the success of the event still lies on CEB’s shoulders. They have made an important move in selecting upbeat contemporary artists. There is still a lot that remains to be seen though, and we hope that CEB puts a good deal of thought into preparations as we get closer to April 19.

The British film critic Anthony Lane once posed a rather devastating question. “What is the point of Demi Moore?” he asked. Now, after this year’s Oscar season has finally come to a close, Lane’s question deserves a broader application. Demi Moore aside, in a time when real, palpable problems shake our country, what is the point of Hollywood?
If you watched the Oscars this year, you will undoubtedly have seen Sean Penn’s acceptance speech for his prizewinning performance in Milk. The film, a masterful exploration of this country’s embarrassing intolerance of homosexuality, is a particularly poignant one in a year in which Proposition 8 passed in California. But, in an apparent attempt to reiterate such artistic profundity, Penn chose not to give the usual Oscar spiel of effusive gratitude. Instead, he urged those who supported the ban on gay marriage to reflect on their decision’s impact.
I don’t know about you, but I found it difficult to keep from rolling my eyes throughout the entire thing. And not because of what Penn said—I happen to be in complete agreement with him on this issue—but because it was clear that he believed that I (and the millions of others watching) had an obligation to listen.
Unfortunately, the same sort of celebrity arrogance, which presumes that the American public should listen to actors by virtue of their being famous, is pervasive. In the recent “Presidential Pledge” video that Moore and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, created with the help of dozens of other “inspired” actors, a group of Hollywood celebrities comes together with the intent to catalyze the deep, profound change America “needs” at the dawn of its forty-fourth presidency.
Beginning with a clip of an Obama speech calling for “a new spirit of patriotism and responsibility,” the video has the idea that we should all make a pledge to do what we can to save our ailing country. Not just any pledge, though—only a “Presidential Pledge” will do. What that means, I’m not quite sure—Moore, for instance, pledged to smile more; Eva Longoria said she’d laugh more; and, best of all, Eva Mendes promised to use less bottled water (not to give up bottled water altogether—just to use less). You get the picture—now that all the “right people” are talking about it, citizenship is something America should embrace. Again, the arrogance. 
While there’s clearly something wrong with trivializing important issues and causes like gay rights, the environment, or citizenship for the sake of having the political equivalent of the “It Bag,” it’s the air of self-proclaimed importance that’s really the problem. I take no issue with celebrities having political opinions, and (most of the time) I don’t mind when they vocalize those opinions. After all, that’s their constitutionally guaranteed right. But, when they use (or, rather, abuse) their celebrity status as a vessel for advancing some cause, too many Hollywood “A-listers” seem to have forgotten how they came to be what and who they are.
The reason celebrities are famous in the first place is that the movies they make entertain a huge number of people who will pay the $8 ticket fee to watch a two-hour show. When the American people flood the box office with cash, they do so out of a desire to be entertained, not to be preached to. With every ticket they buy, moviegoers aren’t necessarily endorsing the views of the actors they see on the screen. Celebrities are agents of entertainment, not the “elect” who are destined to transform our society for the better. They are merely a group of people with the rare ability to make their audiences laugh and cry on cue, and such talent is merely a matter of good fortune. And why should we allow people whose “prominence” is as arbitrary as the films playing at a local theater to wield any major influence on political and social discourse? 
Aside from new and improved special effects, what Hollywood seems to have been producing lately is noise, noise that we don’t need. In light of everything threatening the fabric of this country, what is the point of a place like that? Lane’s question, albeit in an altered form, deserves an answer.

Last Friday, we discovered that guests at the Chinese Students Association’s Graffiti Party had scrawled racial slurs on the walls of the Lowell Grille. This blatant act of intolerance is unacceptable. Unfortunately, this event is just one of the most recent in a series of discriminatory incidents that have transpired in the past two weeks.
Earlier this month, controversy boiled at Dartmouth concerningits newly appointed president, Dr. Jim Yong Kim. An anonymous e-mail referred to Dr. Kim as a “Chinaman” and even went so far as to claim that “Dartmouth is America, not Panda Garden Rice Village Restaurant.” A few days later, xenophobic comments on the Crimson’s website began to circulate over many email lists: “Asians and Indians are not creative and are basically just cookie cutter academic grunts.”
Though these recent attacks have been directed toward the Asian American community, no community at Harvard has been exempt from overt discrimination over the past few years. The Quad incident, the vandalizing of the Chabad House Menorah, and other incidents affecting the Latino and queer communities are only a few of too many examples of individuals being marginalized at Harvard. While each incident may represent a minor, isolated instance of bigotry, collectively these events reveal a deeper, systemic problem: Discrimination still laces our society and crosses lines of race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, and creed. 
From this perspective, the messages left on the wall in the basement of Lowell House are indicative of a larger, unseen level of discrimination in society. The ignorant quips that we overhear on the street, the judgmental glances of passing strangers, the unconscious but offensive actions of others—these all remind us that none of us is immune from hatred. They reflect the intolerance that permeates our community. These experiences are our own messages on the wall. 
When discrimination occurs, it is natural for the targeted communities to focus inward on solidarity. At the same time, for those of us who do not directly identify with the victims of intolerance, it is easy to feel that the problem is not our own. 
But defamation of walls and monuments, racial profiling, and discriminatory layoffs all stem from the ignorance present in our shared community. We must realize that attacks on individual groups are fundamentally divisive and tear at the fabric that holds our community together. These incidents are thus not only an assault on our human dignity, but also an assault on our community as a whole. 
Rather than allow such matters to pass unaddressed, we should view them as opportunities to unite as a campus and to highlight the values that connect us rather than the differences that divide us. To conceptualize these incidents as isolated events targeting specific groups is to deny the fact that we are all connected as a student body and as a community. Whether these incidents of ignorance and racial discrimination strike far away or close to home, we are all affected. 
The Harvard community now faces an important choice. Do we choose to stand back divided, or do we step forward as one? 
This is our moment. We call upon you, the Harvard community, to seize this unique opportunity for solidarity. This Wednesday at noon, we will rally together as one community, with one voice. We will gather in front of University Hall to demonstrate our commitment to tolerance and acceptance. Though we cannot eradicate discrimination through a single rally, we only ensure its survival through silence. Only when we unite as one Harvard can we wipe our walls clean of ignorance.

“Michael Steele should be raising money, instead of hip-hop-itizing the platform,” former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell told the Harvard Republican Club at this year’s Lincoln Day Dinner. His words were well chosen for the audience. While many Harvard Republicans are confident in their beliefs, some are self-conscious about their affiliation. Skepticism of party dogma is an admirable trait, no doubt, but embarrassment over your party label is an unnecessary handicap.
These Republicans are sheepish because, like most students, they want to fit in. Imagine yourself, a Republican, at an Institute of Politics Director’s Dinner. Shirley Temple in hand, you prattle on with a state representative’s chief of staff. As he gushes about Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, you realize—surprise, surprise—he’s a Democrat. Do you tell him you think Patrick’s speeches sound as corny as a 1950’s jingle? No, you just smile and nod—no reason to rock the boat, you think.
Unfortunately, some Republicans apologize for the few waves they make. In 1985, HRC president Mark Lagon chided the Crimson for portraying the club as a group of pro-life “extremists.” In 1995, HRC vice president Scott Tribble asserted, “We are not the stereotypical bad-guy Republicans who are rich and hate minorities and women.” And in 2000, HRC vice president Michael Housman agreed that the club had been uninviting to moderates since “[s]ome people would even wear coats and ties to meetings.” 
Certainly, many Republicans are moderates, and their cautious rhetoric accurately describes their views. But conservatives incriminate themselves by acting like they’re guilty until proven innocent.  First, blending in is unlikely on a campus where, according to a Crimson poll, 80 percent of students voted for Obama. Like it or not, Republicans always will be on the fringe. Second, apologizing for stereotypes aids the opposition because it implies that others’ misconceptions are well founded. It’s like answering the question, “When are you going to lose weight?” There’s no right answer.
Moreover, Harvard Democrats rarely apologize for their beliefs. For example, several Democrats are vehement supporters of gay marriage; a few even label their opponents “bigots.” But the Dems seldom reassure the Crimson that their club is “tolerant” or “inclusive” of social conservatives. Democrats aren’t embarrassed about their views; why are Republicans?
Most importantly, this embarrassment with the party alienates allies from other schools. Imagine you’re at a College Republicans’ summer conference in Washington, D.C. You’re chatting with students from more conservative campuses when one of them calls George W. Bush his hero. You cringe—you liked Bush, but not that much—and the others roll their eyes: They think you’re a New York Times-reading, sushi-eating liberal.
In fact, you’re a conservative; You even listen to Rush Limbaugh, not just read about him in Gail Collins’ columns. And you’re annoyed at these other students judging you. Many of them aren’t challenged as often or as aggressively as you are to defend the GOP. Who do they think they are?
This is the wrong way to think. Harvard Republicans should show more confidence against their opponents and more solidarity with their allies. Otherwise, they will fall prey to the strategy that the majority routinely employs against the minority: divide and conquer. When Republicans point fingers at each other, Democrats pick up the scraps.
Look at the history: In 1957, moderates split from the HRC to form the Eisenhower Club, which died soon thereafter. In 1995, centrists again jumped ship, forming the Republican Alliance, another short-lived group. To capitalize on the HRC’s bloodletting, the Democrats offered moderate Republicans free membership in their club. Today, the HRC is in fine form, with a comfortable mix of moderates and conservatives at the helm. Still, some Republicans get antsy when asked whether Limbaugh is the de facto head of the GOP.
There’s no need to apologize. And, before they abandon Limbaugh, Republicans should see how liberals are treating future New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02. The Salient editor emeritus is more measured in tone and more pragmatic in policy than Limbaugh, yet, when the Old Gray Lady announced his hiring, liberals pounced. A leftist think tank, the Center for American Progress, blasted Douthat in a newsletter, taking passages from his Crimson columns out of context and labeling his stances “hard-line.” As long as you have an R next to your name, some ideologues never will accept you.
So Harvard Republicans should revel in their distinction and enjoy the benefits of “tolerating” those conservative “extremists.” For instance, when Reagan won the presidency in 1980, the HRC ballooned to 290 members in the euphoria surrounding his election. How’s that for inclusive?

For students looking for personalized, one-on-one career counsel in July, the Office of Career Services may not be the place to go.  Amid sweeping budget cuts across the University, OCS is considering the option of slicing operation costs by cutting one-on-one advising for the month of July, according to Interim Director Robin E. Mount.In early April, the University will assess the expected figures for next year’s budget based on the number of eligible staffers­ that have accepted the retirement incentive package. Eligible employees are those over 55 years of age who will have worked at the University for at least a decade by June 30. According to Mount, if a substantial number of employees accept the package, then the University-mandated budget cuts will be less drastic for offices within Harvard, such as OCS.Currently, six OCS staffers would be devoted to counseling undergraduate students on an individual basis in July, among other duties. These employees—and additional OCS staffers—may be expected to take extended unpaid vacations in July, while OCS is in “sleep mode,” according to Mount.   In past years, OCS employees have tended to take their vacations during July, in part because they are in high demand during the academic year, the interim director said. But Mount also emphasized that students who depend on certain OCS resources during July—including the Harvard Business School 2+2 program applicants, students on fellowships expecting checks in the mail, and graduate students writing dissertations—would still receive these services. Additionally, undergraduate interns who unexpectedly find themselves without a summer job could still rely on OCS for impromptu bailouts. But what OCS does not anticipate doing, according to Mount, is laying off employees. Instead, she has spearheaded an effort to seek consensus among the OCS staff to determine how to best cope with expected budget cuts.Mount referenced the president of Wheaton College, who she said reduced his own annual salary by 7 percent, saying that she is open to the possibility of taking a direct hit from budget constraints herself.”All leadership [at Harvard] is going to do it. It’s our way of responding together,” she said, noting that budgetary belt-tightening is required across the board in a recessionary economy. “We’re a team.”Mount added that OCS has already “trimmed the fat” in its expenditures, reducing food, travel, and the purchase of paper products.  Other, more long-term alternatives to cutting back on operation costs included closing OCS on Fridays during the academic year, but Mount said that this wasn’t even a viable option for her.“From the students’ perspective, we want to be fully staffed during the year,” she said. “We want to be the best for students.”­—Staff writer Bita M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to create a task force examining alternative social spaces on campus, while raising the possibility that the UC might pay for property to give students recreational opportunities in the future.  The new task force will be staffed by six Council representatives, including UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10, and will hold meetings open to all interested students in anticipation of presenting its findings to the Council on April 12.“We are going to employ every option that we have to secure an alternative social space,” said Flores, adding that the purchase of property was on the table.Forty-five Mt. Auburn Street, a property currently housing the Democracy Center, an activist support organization, was mentioned by name in the legislation. The property is now for sale and has been used as a student meeting space in the past.Yesterday’s legislation requested that the owners of the property take it off the market for the time being to “give time for students to develop viable proposals.”Before beginning its legislative work, the Council hosted a Town Hall meeting on social spaces that featured a five-member panel moderated by UC Treasurer Anthony R. Britt ’10, and included Flores as well as the presidents of the Harvard College Democrats, the Black Students Association, and the Chinese Students Association. Panelists discussed issues such as strategies they employed to get rooms for socializing, current spaces they relied on, and what they would like to see in an ideal social space.Yesterday’s work on social spaces came in a meeting that lasted just under three hours and spurred debate over whether UC business could be conducted more efficiently. The meeting, which included the Town Hall meeting, six pieces of legislation, and an update on the status of a cable TV project, was also punctuated by lectures from the chairs of the Council’s two major sub-committees, who scolded representatives for complaining about the two-hour duration of last week’s meeting. “I understand that the meetings have been longer,” said Student Affairs Committee Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10. “Quite frankly, it’s because we’re doing more things this semester.”UC Representative Sonia S. Dara ’12 suggested that perhaps meetings could be shortened if “people kept clapping to a minimum.” Representatives typically clap to celebrate the passage of legislation or to mark major speeches. This week’s grants package proved contentious, with the debate centering on two separate allocations—one for a $2,000 allocation for movable lights for house theaters, and another for an $1,850 grant for the restoration of Quad Sound Studios, a student-run recording studio. The house theaters grant passed, but the vote on Quad Sounds Studios funding was pushed back to next week after Josh J. Nuni ’10, who said he had experience with the organization, called some of the group’s practices into question.—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

Nearly 100 students gathered atop the Science Center last night to witness the Space Shuttle Discovery flicker across the skies of Cambridge after its launch from NASA’s John F. Kennedy Space Center.The shuttle took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 7:43 p.m., and a mere six minutes later it emerged from the South-Southeast area of the sky and traveled to the East-Northeast part of the sky.Students made their way up to the tenth floor of the Science Center for the chance to catch a glimpse of the spacecraft, which appeared as a fast moving, relatively bright, star-like object.“I had never seen a shuttle launch before and thought it would be an interesting sight,” said Levi H. Dudte ’11, one of many spectators.For another observer the spectacle reflected her future aspirations.“I have always wanted to be an astronaut and thought it would be cool to see a rocket launch,” said Diana Suen ’11, another onlooker.The congregation of students on the roof of the Science Center to watch the launch was organized by STAHR (Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe), an organization that also trains students on the use of the observatory and gives access to the 10th floor of the Science Center.According to Daniel A. Handlin ’11, a STAHR member, shuttle launches are only visible from Cambridge once or twice a year.“You can only see a shuttle launch one minute a year and this was that minute,” Handlin said.Although there are several shuttle launches a year, they can only be seen when they occur at night. “Orbital mechanics dictate the launch time,” said Kyle J. Herring, a NASA Spokesman.According to Herring, the launch time is chosen in order to optimize the use of propellant for the shuttle’s trip to the International Space Station (ISS).The shuttle mission STS-119 will last 13 days and will bring the last US-designed component to the ISS. There are seven astronauts aboard STS-119: Lee J. Archambault, Dominic A. Antonelli, Joseph M. Acaba, John L. Phillips, Steve R. Swanson, Richard R. Arnold, and Koichi Wakata.The mission was originally supposed to launch in mid-February, but was delayed because of problems with the shuttle’s flow valves. The launch was again delayed from March 11 to yesterday because of a leak in a vent line.The final component of the ISS will be delivered at the end of 2010 on the space shuttle’s final mission before its expected retirement, according to Herring.

The Aspiring Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs student group recognized singer, actress, and entrepreneur Tatyana M. Ali ’02 at a conference Saturday focusing on nontraditional business fields and resourceful job-seeking in the midst of an economic downturn.The conference, attended by about 150 students and held in the Charles Hotel, featured panels on creative career tracks like entertainment, sports, and fashion, followed by a luncheon that seated students with industry panelists. The luncheon featured Ali, who is the CEO of HazraH Entertainment—an independent film company specializing in urban entertainment, according to its Web site. She is best known for her role as Ashley Banks on the popular 1990s sitcom, “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”A few students have secured internships and full-time jobs through previous conferences, according to the event’s organizers, who pointed to Christina S. Wells ’08 as one such example. Attending this year’s conference to support her current employer, Wells said that she would advise students to seek more creative careers outside of the typical investment-banking and finance fields.“All my roommates had done e-recruiting,” Wells said. “I never got through one application.” Instead, when Wells attended the AMBLE Spring Career Conference her senior year, she met Alvin Bowles, the senior vice president of integrated marketing at BET Networks. According to Wells, Bowles initially told her, “Sorry, we’re not hiring,” but she continued e-mailing and calling before finally securing an internship in New York City the summer after her graduation.Wells called the current economic conditions a “great opportunity,” forcing job-seekers to be more flexible than in times past.“This pushes students to think outside the box,” she said. “E-recruiting is very easy to fall into, but this challenges students not to rest on the comfort of e-recruiting and to do their own research.”Ali seemed to agree. “At Harvard the traditional route is investment banking, which is not where you want to be,” she said, drawing laughter. The singer-actress stressed “blazing a path that is unique,” advising attendees to “stay true to yourself, and the money will flow.” Conference attendee Robert C. Watson ’09 said he believed some students were already turning away from the financial sector to overseas employment, fellowships, and public service in light of the current financial crisis.Panelists at the event stressed the importance of adaptability and persistence. “In this environment, be resourceful and resilient,” said Bryant S. McBride, the CEO and founding partner of Accrue, a venture capital sports and entertainment firm.“We might hear a thousand ‘Nos,’ but it’s that one ‘Yes!’ that’s important,” Ali said during her address Saturday.—Staff writer Ellen X.

This weekend, the Black Law Students Association held its annual spring conference, titled “The Fierce Urgency of Now: Effecting Change at Home and Across the Globe”  with New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin, Jr., as a keynote speaker.The conference, which ran from Friday through yesterday afternoon, was open to Harvard students and the general public. It was intended to inform attendees of issues affecting the Black community, according to the BLSA’s Web site.Brigid K. Ndege ’10, a Harvard Law School student and BLSA member, said she attended the event to learn about topics that aren’t brought up on a daily basis and also to interact with a larger community.Similarly, freelance business consultant Melanie Morris, a Boston resident, said she was there to network and to meet people of color who share her interests and goals. One of the speeches that attendees, including Morris, looked forward to the most was Nagin’s keynote address.Nagin, who gave the speech at Friday’s dinner, delivered the message that challenges are everywhere and that odds can be defeated.“You can overcome even when you think you can’t...[but] it’s also about being willing to accept [your] Katrina,” he said. He spoke about what he had done for the city, the changes he had made to procedures in dealing with hurricanes, the new charter schools, and the new playgrounds.New Orleans faced a dip since Katrina, according to Nagin, “but [New Orleans] has risen every year since. Katrina’s rainbow is in effect,” referring to the idea that with every storm comes a rainbow.Brian C. Smith, a representative of sponsoring law firm WilmerHale, said the mayor’s words were honest and it was inspiring to hear about a city that is coming up after having been through so much. Smith said his firm contributes to the annual conference because they are committed to informing students about their options and to let Harvard graduates know they can practice outside of Boston.Smith added that he thought the conference gave a home to “a community who wants to get to know each other while pushing each other to strive.”BLSA Co-Chairs Rachel E. Clarke, Katrina J. Copney, and Nicole A. Thompson could not be reached for comment yesterday.

The number of on-campus recruiters at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences fell by nearly 20 percent this spring, leading to an ever-more competitive job market and the diversification of students’ career choices outside of the finance and consulting sectors.According to Robin E. Mount, interim director of the Office of Career Services, recruiting at Harvard College fell 10 percent in the fall of 2008 and 19 percent this spring. Six thousand eRecruiting interviews were held on campus this year, she said.“The economy’s sinking, and we weren’t surprised,” Mount said.Students shared similar sentiments about the shrinking job market. Tracy L. Meng ’10 said she secured an internship with a consulting firm this summer, but said that this year’s job process had been especially difficult.“It’s been tough, and I’ve been grateful to have an offer,” she said. “I think that eRecruiting is one of the most stressful processes someone can do...It’s your life for the month of February.”Meng said that she came up with several backup plans before the recruiting process, thinking of going back home to work for her dad’s business or entering the public sector this summer.Many students have considered similar paths, leading to a more competitive applicant pool for fellowships and other non-finance-related internships. The trend has allowed non-traditional companies to capitalize on the worsening financial job market. Mount said that businesses that may have not traditionally recruited at Harvard are now planning to do so, such as Pepsi, Madison Square Garden, and smaller boutique investment banking firms.“New companies feel like they now have the chance to get in front of Harvard students,” she said. “From the company’s perspective, it’s an evening of the playing field.”She said students will also be able to take advantage of new opportunities in alternative energy and other 21st century industries.Malcolm R. Rivers ’09 said he views the shift away from finance and consulting as a somewhat positive phenomenon, as it has forced people to expand their options and discover passions that they may not have otherwise realized. Rivers will work for Teach for America next year, a path that an increasing number of Harvard students have taken.“It’s interesting to see how the [culture of Harvard] has changed,” he said. “It’s good to see people who are directing their energy toward something based more on improving the lives of underprivileged youths.”OCS is providing support for seniors who are still finding postgraduate opportunities. The “Job Search Boot Camp,” a program that has seen an increase in demand this year, consists of personalized guidance and one-on-one consultations with OCS counselors.—Staff writer Victor W.

The weather has always been an easy thing to blame for seemingly unprovoked aches and pains. Now, researchers at Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) have made it even easier, publishing a study that links high temperatures and headaches.
“Amongst the most readily cited but poorly studied triggers of headaches are these weather related variables,” said Gregory A. Wellenius, one of the co-authors of the study. “Although there have been a number of earlier studies linking headaches with weather conditions, the large, better studies of weather effects have really had mixed results.”
The classic methods of studying headaches involve comparing the number of people coming into emergency rooms for headache-related causes in the winter as opposed to the summer, or to ask patients to keep diaries. But these methods don’t necessarily illustrate the triggers of headaches.
“A trigger is: why did something happen to you today?” said Kenneth J. Mukamal, the first author of the study. “What was the acute thing that brought this event right now?”
The researchers took an individualized approach in order to ascertain what specifically was causing headaches. They looked at records of 7,054 headache patients over a 7-year period who came in to the emergency room of BIDMC and compared weather and pollution levels before and after each patient experienced severe headaches.
This method was first developed at Harvard, according to Wellenius, and its advantage is its independence from the type of population it is studying. 
“If I were to ask how many people came to Harvard Health Services every month of the year it would be obvious that headaches are much worse in the winter, because that’s when the students are around. But in the summer, miraculously they would all go away,” Mukamal said. “In our case, we are not reliant on the population. We are asking each individual what happened to trigger his or her headache.”
While this study establishes a correlative relationship rather than a causal one, it could influence the way patients and clinicians alike think about headaches. 
“People could try to be careful on warmer days,” Mukamal said. “It [also] encourages us to keep an open mind about what kind of triggers we should be looking for.”
The study also raises the broader issue of the relationship between the ongoing environmental changes and public health. 
“It’s important to recognize that this starts to build a case for the public health impact by environmental changes over time, and how this may influence lots of different diseases including severe headaches,” Wellenius said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Waving rainbow banners, American flags, and signs that displayed messages such as “God Strongly Dislikes Hate” and “We’re Staying Gay, Sorry,” approximately 400 counter-protestors waited for the arrival of the Westboro Baptist Church at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School last Friday morning.
At 11:24 a.m., six members of the anti-gay religious organization—including a 15-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy—finally appeared, entering the area the Cambridge Police had designated for their protest. From the other side, separated by two fences and a neutral zone, the counter-protestors began chanting loudly, drowning out the church group’s words and songs.
Last month, the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church, whose nationwide picketing activities against homosexuality have earned them a “hate group” designation, announced their plans to protest the high school’s gay-straight alliance, Project10East. Since then, the school had worked with the mayor’s office and the police department to determine an appropriate response.
When the day finally arrived on March 13, the protests engendered an ironic consequence: although they propounded a divisive message, their effect on the community was decidedly uniting. 
CAMBRIDGE COMES TOGETHER
According to Jeffrey M. Walker, the mayor’s chief of staff and a member of the city’s GLBT commission, the initial plan was simply to ignore the protest. Later, after realizing that many Cambridge residents were going to plan their own protests, city leaders decided to act as the unofficial coordinators of the counter-protest for safety reasons.
But Walker noted that—despite its homophobic slogans—the WBC can bring unexpected benefits to the community.
“What I sometimes secretly believe is that they’re gay rights activists,” he said. “They galvanize the community in a way that wouldn’t necessarily happen if they didn’t deliver their crazy hatred message. Because they’re so extreme, they get people to come out and respond to them.”
Christopher M. Mason, a Cambridge GLBT commissioner who organizes Phelps-a-thon fundraisers—named after WBC leader Fred Phelps—to raise money for every minute that the WBC is holding a protest, said that the WBC encourages unprecedented unity among its opponents.
“They’re bringing conservatives and progressives together and that’s a positive thing. That rarely ever happens, so if Fred Phelps can make it happen that’s great,” he said. 
Those protesting the WBC—including students, teachers, city officials, clergy members, and Harvard students—saw the counter-protest as an opportunity to celebrate unity.
“The most important message of today’s counter-protest is that the students of CRLS are loved and respected and when haters attack their school, we will have their backs,” said Sue Hyde, a leader in the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
“THE BIBLE PREACHES HATE”
The Westboro Baptist Church was founded in 1955 by Rev. Fred Phelps with an anti-gay agenda. The group has 213 members, a majority of whom are related to Phelps.
According to the church’s Web site, www.godhatesfags.com, its members “adhere to the teachings of the Bible, preach against all form of sin (e.g. fornication, adultery [including divorce and remarriage], sodomy), and insist that the sovereignty of God and the doctrines of grace be taught and expounded publicly to all men.”
Famous for picketing Matthew W. Shepard’s funeral, the group also holds anti-gay protests at productions of “The Laramie Project”—a play based on Shepard’s murder—and the funerals of AIDS victims. Recently, they have begun demonstrating at soldiers’ funerals across the country, saying that their deaths are evidence of “God’s judgment” of America.
The group also stages protests near high schools, like CRLS, that have a gay-straight alliances.
“I think Fred Phelps is a man who has not enough to do,” said Mayor E. Denise Simmons.
The church has demonstrated in Cambridge in the past, including at Harvard’s commencement in 2003 and at the city’s celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2004.
The WBC members, who have conducted over 40,000 protests, state on their Web site that they preach hate “because the Bible preaches hate.”
Christopher Ott, the communications manager for the ACLU of Massachusetts, said he believes that the WBC’s message is “reprehensible” but upholds their right to state their opinions. 
“As long as they stay within the law, they have the right to free speech,” Ott said. “And for those who are unhappy with what they think, they have of course the same right.”
LOVE, NOT HATE
The response within CRLS was organized by the Rainbow Coalition, a group of students led by Project10East coordinator Kathy Keegan.
While some students wanted to stage a “flamboyant” counter-protest, others thought it was best to ignore the group completely. Principal Christopher Saheed emphasized that student safety was of the utmost importance, saying that he preferred that students not engage directly with members of WBC.
Ultimately, the activities planned for the students were not open to the public.
On Thursday afternoon, the coalition members held a screening of “Milk,” the biographical film about gay activist and politician Harvey Milk that recently won two Academy Awards. On Friday morning, they handed out pink triangles—symbols of gay pride—during the students’ homeroom period. Mayor Simmons also spoke at a rally held by students during the first half of lunch.
The public protest was held in a fenced-off area behind the school.
Although students were not officially allowed off campus during the protest, many students joined the larger demonstration during their lunch period.
Jacob M. Harris, a junior at CRLS, brought a life-sized plastic cow to protest against the WBC.
“I think it’s ridiculous that they are here and this [cow] is just as ridiculous,” he said.
Singing “All You Need Is Love,” a mass of counter-protestors arrived in a parade around 11 a.m. While others danced to “I Will Survive,” Andrea Hart of Art Street-Sidewalk Sand drew peace doves on the sidewalk “to remind people we’re here about creating love, not hate.”
The WBC members carried signs that read, “Thou Shalt Not Kill,” “God Hates You,” and “God Hates Obama.”
Elizabeth M. Phelps, daughter of Fred Phelps, said she disapproves of the President because he “fiercely” supports gay rights.
“Obama is rising out of the sea of people like the anti-Christ. He is going to usher in the final destruction,” Phelps said, adding that the process will be “thrilling” to watch.
“We’re here to tell the young people of doomed America that they are the last generation and the most cursed. They have no jobs, no homes, no prospects, just curses,” said Margie J. Phelps, another daughter of the Church’s founder. “They are the legacy of their lying preachers, teachers, and parents, who also hate them.” 
“The only hope for them is to obey God,” she added. “Period.”
Several representatives from Cambridge churches, who wrote a joint letter to the community criticizing the WBC before the protest, said they did not condone the group’s message of hate.
“We do not support the gay/homosexual lifestyle based on our belief. However, we do have gay and lesbian people in our congregation and we feel that kind of language is unacceptable,” said Bishop Brian Greene from the Pentecostal Tabernacle Church.
Father Antony Hughes, the pastor of St. Mary’s Orthodox Church, said he believes the WBC interpretation of the Bible is “blasphemous” because it is a misrepresentation of God.
“The scriptures are very plain. He is very loving,” he said.
Hughes also said he objected to the Phelps’ decision to include their children in their protests.
“Frankly, I think it’s a form of child abuse,” Hughes said. “They’re teaching their children hate-filled ideology.”
Elizabeth M. Phelps, who also brought her eight-year-old son Daniel J. Phelps, said in a Crimson interview that he has been to about 2,100 protests so far. He said that he enjoyed protesting “because it’s fun and there’s a whole audience here.”
Lydia R. Phelps-Davis, the 15-year-old granddaughter of Fred Phelps, also said she was pleased that so many counter-protestors showed up.
“They’re angry because they know we’re right, but they don’t want to believe us,” she said. “That is why there’s this huge crowd over there shouting at us, thinking they’re going to get somewhere with us.”
WBC GOES TO HARVARD
Evelyn R. Wenger ’11, the campaigns director for the Harvard Democrats, said that she was disquieted by Phelps-Davis.
“She was dancing along with glee on her face and I found that disturbing,” Wenger said. 
About 50 Harvard students and tutors, organized by the Harvard Democrats and the Harvard College Queer Student and Allies (QSA), participated in the counter-protest. 
“We’re going [to CRLS] to show support for the students and to let them know that the students there deserve respect,” said QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11.
Chan said he thought the protest went well. 
“I felt like we did a good job of accomplishing our goal,” he said. “The tone remained relatively positive.”
Wenger also said she believed that the message of unity and respect was generally maintained, but she added that it “devolved a little bit.”
“There were a couple of [chants] that were kind of negative and more personal than I would have liked.” Wenger said. “But generally nothing was bad or really mean-spirited.”
According to its Web site, the WBC members plan to return to Cambridge this Friday to protest Harvard specifically. They plan to assemble on Quincy Street, right outside the Barker Center.  
Members of the Harvard Democrats and QSA who are organizing the response said they hoped to sustain the positive tone.
Wenger said that Harvard’s counter-protest, which will be more of a celebration with live music, will not have an official schedule of events. 
Several Christian groups have also taken a stance against the WBC.
Rachel A. Esplin ’10, president of the Harvard Latter-day Saint Student Association, said she believes the WBC is “distorting the gospel of Christ.” 
“I can definitely say we don’t support the beliefs and practices,” Esplin said. “We believe in loving all people.”

Vice-Chairman of the Republican National Committee’s Platform Committee J. Kenneth Blackwell called young Republicans to action at the Harvard Republican Club’s seventh annual Lincoln Day Dinner on Saturday.The formal celebration of Lincoln’s legacy and Republican ideals was held in Eliot Dining Hall, where white tablecloths littered with pennies and a hand-drawn elephant greeted the 150 students in attendance—a record, according to HRC President Colin J. Motley ’10.Past speakers at the event have included conservative activist Star Parker and Michael S. Steele, who has since been elected chairman of the Republican National Committee. The evening began with a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, led by HRC Secretary Rachel L. Wagley ’11. In his speech, Blackwell repeatedly emphasized the importance of returning to Republican values and not losing hope despite President Barack H. Obama’s victory and his enduring popularity.“As a Republican party, the issue is how do we respond to the political valley that we now find ourselves in,” Blackwell said. “If we respond by trying to blend in, we lose.” Blackwell targeted Republicans who had “campaigned like Ronald Reagan and governed like Jimmy Carter,” as the primary reason for the loss of confidence in the political right. He encouraged a return to an ideology of faith, free-market Capitalism, and individual liberty. Blackwell framed his speech in the context of a growing threat to the American way of life. He called the Democratic Party’s current initiatives an “attempt to pull off the most significant realignment of political power in our 232 year history.”Nevertheless, his tone remained inspirational and surprisingly upbeat. He concluded by encouraging those in attendance to “bring light and truth and freedom to this American discussion.”Motley said he was extremely pleased by the turnout for the event. The record number of attendees included representatives from the Harvard Kennedy School as well as the Harvard Business and Law Schools, Boston College, Wellesley, Tufts, and Brandeis, according to Motley. “It’s great to have the opportunity for Republicans from all these different places to get together,” Motley said.Blackwell also said he enjoyed speaking at the event and encouraging young Republicans not to lose hope. “The Republican party leadership has to talk about winning elections and rebuilding the base, which you do with an inspirational message,” he said. —Crimson Staff Writer Evan T.R. Rosenman can be reached at erosenm@fas.harvard.edu.

In a walking tour of Allston and Brighton Saturday morning, local residents reiterated their concerns about the slowdown in construction of Harvard’s Allston Science Complex, but also said the University should focus on finding “creative solutions” to improve the current state of the neighborhood.
Tim and Jane McHale, Allston residents and members of the Allston Brighton North Neighbors Forum, emphasized the need to connect the Allston and Brighton neighborhoods—currently separated by empty industrial facilities and the Brighton Mills Shopping Center—perhaps by building small-scale housing and parks. And Anne C. Lusk, a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Public Health and a Brookline resident, said that Harvard and the city should take advantage of the economic downturn to focus on other aspects of Harvard’s development plans—such as reducing automobile usage and facilitating bicycle transportation.
“I think especially with the downturn in the economy, we need hope, some forward movement in creative ways,” Lusk said, suggesting that University and city planners look at constructing European-style, barrier-separated, bicycle tracks with a parallel sidewalk in Allston. She noted that because Boston is sorely lacking in bike lanes and cycle tracks, such a development strategy would make Allston a model for alternative transportation.
Lusk said that Harvard and city planners have been receptive to including bike paths and cycle tracks in their development plans, but that budgetary restrictions may be forcing the University to prioritize other initiatives.  
Zakcq Lockrem, a member of the Boston Planners Network which advocates for socioeconomic justice through urban planning, said that one inexpensive and short-term project that would increase foot-traffic in Allston would be to install public art—possibly in cooperation with the Graduate School of Design—on vacant Western Ave. storefronts. 
“We now have opportunities...to start thinking about [community development] from perspectives that aren’t as time-crunched,” Lockrem said. 
Harry Mattison, an Allston resident and founding member of the Allston Brighton North Neighbors Forum, echoed his long-standing concerns about Harvard’s vacant property holdings in the neighborhood, and lamented that Barry’s Corner—the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave, envisioned as a center of commerce akin to Cambridge’s Harvard Square—is still largely defined by an abandoned Harvard-owned Citgo Station. 
While he acknowledged that finding “the right kind of tenants” in order to attract customers and foot-traffic is difficult given Allston’s current state, he said that filling property vacancies is crucial to improving the existing neighborhood and would not require expensive new construction projects.
“[Harvard] needs to start thinking creatively,” Mattison said. “Something has to jump-start this, some sort of stimulus.”
The walking tour, coordinated by Mattison, aimed to provide Harvard students and Allston residents with an opportunity to see the University’s impact on the community first-hand. For several residents—and the three Harvard students that attended—Saturday was the first time they saw the massive “hole in the ground” at the Science Complex site.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Been posted in the library for a good 15 hours at this point?  Ever since you attempted to ease that hangover with eggs way back during brunch?  Sunday VOIDs can be the ultimate test of one's mettle.   Your efforts will not be in vain, though.  As Nike tells us just in time for the tourney: there are no Cinderellas.
...Except for that really smart kid you know who studied for about three hours and will do better than you.  In a cynical mood, eh?  You might enjoy re-watching the hanging, drawing, and quartering of former Crimson President Jim Cramer '77 by John Stewart.  While we're pleased Stewart has found a new target after his best buddy rode off into the sunset, FlyBy still holds a soft spot for Cramer from its days watching Mad Money as a budding i-banker (pre-crisis, of course) and this infamous clip.  Yes, we still hate Bill Poole to this day.
If all this real world nonsense is just too much for your VOID state of mind, we'll draw it back for you.  Bad paintings of Barack? Still too much?  First of all, you probably shouldn't be reading this.  Second of all, we've still got the potion.

President Faust held the first of her generous two "office hour"-s of the semester from 4-5 this afternoon in Mass. Hall. If you were not aware of this opportunity, don’t feel bad--you’re in good company. The office hour was really only publicized on the President’s Web site and drew less of a crowd than FlyBy (and probably the administration) expected.
The breakdown of the available slots went something like this:
2-3 = graduate students
1 = an undergrad who wanted to talk about accessible education
3 = Crimson Editors (shout-outs to Photo, FM, and Editorial for representation...though there is no proven correlation, FlyBy is guessing it doesn’t hurt to be part of an organization with tabs on all campus happenings and a slight obsession with stalking University figureheads)
1 of those people was also a student group leader (“Harvard College Act On A Dream is a student sponsored group whose purpose is to motivate Harvard students to become actively involved in immigration reform,” according to their mission statement.)
Even though you've missed your chance this month, Faust will have another office hour on Thursday, April 23 from 4-5 in Mass. Hall. Sign-ups start at 2:30 on the day of and are first-come, first-served.
Maybe sign ups will be more of a battle next month, if FlyBy's readership is high enough.

Need some stimulating new reading material for your bathroom? Has your interest in that stale copy of Diamond Magazine gone a little limp? Well, you're in luck. H BOMB IS BACK!!!! Details after the jump.
But you know as well as we do, that’s not really what H Bomb is all about. According to H BOMB, this is their:
Indeed, they have done a great job on the beyond garnering national attention every time they’ve released. But to FlyBy’s sadness, this remains only the fourth issue since 2004, as they’ve struggled with administrative and funding woes.
A recent e-mail from H BOMB expressed that these woes continue in the face of the nationwide financial crisis--and that might pose problems for the magazine:
H BOMB is now soliciting donations from supporters.
FlyBy is looking anxiously forward to the latest, and (hopefully) greatest revival of H Bomb, even if it cost you $10 a piece. If you want them around more, buy the mag and donate! According to the e-mail, every student organization that gives $20 gets an ad within their pages. What better branding than getting having your org next to…

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you’ll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
As the youngest House, Currier rebels against the austere Harvard standard: while its façade may look like a '70s era retirement home, over the weekend this Quad pad transforms into a campus hotspot.
Location: The Radcliffe Quadrangle, also known as far away from everything.
Rooming: Sweet with a dash of salt. Sophomore housing is generally more palatable than in other houses, though the majority of Currier rooms are singles sans common rooms; for these setups, party-throwing takes creativity. Thanks to a wealth of common spaces, however, Currier maintains a status as party central for ambitious river dwellers and lazy quadlings alike.  Seniors also have a great shot at suites such as the Ten Man or one of three Solaria. Although rooms are cockroach-free, they definitely require some interior decorating--otherwise you'll be staring at cement walls all year.
Dining Hall: Currier's dining hall features two standouts: a giant fountain centerpiece and a warm, friendly staff. You will often find yourself striking up a conversation with Patricia at the checker's desk or catching up with Amy M. Lester, dining hall manager. Dining hall hours go mercifully late and the doors often open early. Currier has also been called the crown jewel of HUDS, as food is characterized by excellent preparation and nice touches, such as cherry tomatoes and peeled cucumber slices.
Late night munching, however, is a sad affair. The average brain break is abysmal after 9 p.m. Quad life is one far away from any late-night food establishment, and night owls either become vending machine regulars or takeout speed-dial savants.
House List: A haven for some, a nuisance for others. Like many house lists, Currierwire features an antagonizing aristocracy, along with mainstays such as Christopher L. Hartl '09 and Frances I. Martel '09. Though the list has its share of borderline asinine threads, the relatively manageable volume and occasional gem make a subscription worthwhile. List moderator Jeffrey D. Nanney '10 attests to two or three subscription requests per week.
House Masters: Down-to-earth and debonair. In little over a semester as House Masters, Anthropology Professor Richard Wrangham and primatologist Elisabeth Ross have made enough of a mark to be beloved by residents. At House Masters' open houses, you're likely to catch Wrangham chatting about current events or giving a group of students an animated primer on animal behavior. The couple is wont to invite distinguished speakers, host impromptu events, and--only when asked--regale you with tales from their years in Uganda. If the Porters are the parents you never had, Ross and Wrangham are your eccentric, worldly, loquacious aunt and uncle. Resident Dean Katherine Stanton also ranks high, hosting wine and cheese tastings for House foodies.
House Culture: Peculiar, though generally positive. The Currier HoCo is dominated by maniacally devoted individuals who are willing to go to any lengths for house pride, and on Housing Day, you'll find them braving the Cambridge weather in barely-there Speedos.
Currier's modus operandi, of course, is partying. Stein Clubs may be standard, but the house is known for blowout Fishbowl events such as Currieroke, when tutors and tutees alike can be found belting out '80s classics, and the notorious Halloween party Heaven and Hell. You can bet something is going down on 64 Linnaean any given weekend.
The Verdict: A.* If you're going to get Quadded, The Tree House is the way to go. While it lacks even baseline aesthetic appeal, great food, a tight house community, and a festive atmosphere more than make up for this House's shortcomings.
*Ratings run as such: [AAA > AA > A > BBB > junk > subprime]
