After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the writers of our constitution included “freedom of speech” in the First Amendment, they probably were not anticipating Rev. Terry Jones.  Jones is currently experiencing his 15 minutes of fame—hopefully it won’t last longer—thanks to his plans to burn Qur’ans at his church in Gainesville, FL this September 11.  Although American citizens have the right to burn this holy text as an exercise of free speech, doing so would be egregiously hateful, as well as dangerous for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. The plans simply should not be carried out.
Jones has made clear that he believes the Qur’an incites violent behavior among Muslims, and insists it is his mission to publicly denounce it.  Not only is this view and “Burn a Qur’an Day” grossly intolerant towards the millions of non-extremist, non-violent Muslims who worship the book, but it could also have an extremely destructive backlash.  As General David Petraeus said on Tuesday, “Images of burning a Qur’an would undoubtedly be used by extremists…to inflame public opinion and incite violence.” Instead of suppressing Islamic radicals, Jones is giving them more motivation to harm our troops.  The best thing he could do for our country is to “back down,” remain silent, and halt his upcoming events.
Unfortunately, Jones’ planned Qur’an burning has already attracted international attention. Sheikh Abdel-Muti Bayyoumi, a Sunni Muslim top official at Egypt’s Al-Azhair University, said the book burning “would ruin America’s relations with the Muslim world.”  Our best hope for damage control is for American public figures to speak up and show that the vast majority of American people does not support Jones’ actions.  Petraeus deserves commendation for expressing his opposition, and we hope that more people in the Obama administration follow his lead.
In the past, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have often been characterized as fights against religious extremism.  Jones’ actions are simply another form of such extremism that must be condemned, especially since it would do great harm to our international image just as we begin to diminish our military presence in Afghanistan and establish a new era of peaceful diplomacy with the Middle East. Only a small group of Muslims extract violent messages from the text, and thus Americans should not disrespect the central tome of a large population of peaceful worshippers.
While Rev. Jones remains within his constitutional rights if he goes through with “Burn a Qur’an Day,” he is completely wrong-headed in regards to the safety of our soldiers, the respect of other cultures, and our ultimate goal of forming peaceful ties with the world’s Muslim community.

Video games are huge these days, and unless you are still challenging your grandfather to games of Pong, you have probably noticed that video games have improved drastically in our lifetime. Today’s video game graphics have evolved simultaneously with computer-hardware technology, which means that games with realistic and jaw-dropping visuals have become industry standard. While popular culture still treats gaming as niche, the industry pulled almost $20 billion in revenue in 2009, an increase of 250 percent since the beginning of the decade. Sixty-five percent of households in the U.S. own a game console, further proving the growing power that interactive media has over the next generation of Americans.
This new power has caused many people to look at games with harsher scrutiny. Video games that are violent are often subject to heated controversy from angry parents who see their kids glorifying guns, car theft, and gang violence. A game using religious background music was recalled from shelves after outcries from certain religious groups. Take Two, a game developer and publishing company, had to pay $20 million because of a sex scene found in a Grand Theft Auto, a game that was already riddled with sex, violence, and drug use, that was only accessible to those who could hack their copy of the game.
Even further, there have been claims of racism in recent video games. For example, Mafia 2 was deemed a “pile of racist nonsense” by Unico National, an Italian-American service organization. The group argued that the game would cause younger Americans to associate Italian-Americans with violence and organized crime. Another game, Left for Dead 2, was accused of being racist by a blogger from The Houston Chronicle. His argument was that by including African-American zombies that a player has to shoot, you make the game unpublishable and racist.
However, it must be acknowledged that elements of race-based caricaturing have been accepted in video games since the inception of the first console. The poster boy for Nintendo, Mario the plumber, was first introduced in 1981 and has since appeared in some 200 games. Many can argue that his appearance and mannerisms represent horrible Italian-American stereotypes, but has Mario really been bad for America? Additionally, the Punch Out! series of video games from 1987 has the main character battle ethnic stereotypes with names after their respective cuisines (Pizza Pasta and Vodka Drunkenski). Much of the hysteria regarding irreligiousness, racism, and general tastelessness in video games is, in fact, due to an oversensitive public.
The general public needs to stop terrorizing the video-game industry. Like novels, video games tell a story of an alternate reality, where the reader or player can escape to for a few hours at a time. Yet, the consumers of video games feel entitled to be able to demand the content that they wish to be sold. Games with lots of violence, sex, or otherwise objectionable content would not be sold if nobody wanted to buy them, and if one doesn’t want to be subjected to its content they can simply not play those games. There is no requirement to buy video games, and a consumer can avoid ones that they don’t want to play by looking at the ratings that are required to be put directly on the front of each game. If parents are concerned, they should more closely monitor the games that their children play.
Game developers have a job to create the most captivating, quality games they can make, not to spread social commentary. Settings such as the Civil War, post-Katrina St. Louis, and World War II may push buttons with some, but they are just as valid for use in a video game as a setting in a novel. It’s important to lend respect to these video-game developers as much as you would to author or an artist. Ultimately, as consumers, we have the ability to dictate the content we receive by buying only the things we want to see and boycotting products that we don’t find suitable.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit landfall in the Gulf and moved on. On August 30 the levees in New Orleans failed. As the fifth anniversary of Katrina comes into focus, we claim to have learned many lessons from this disaster—but judging by what many Americans write on blogs, comments sections in media reports, and reporter’s follow up stories, we are destined to repeat our mistakes.
As a San Diego tourist who arrived in New Orleans on August 26, 2005, when the New Orleans Saints were playing football in the Superdome, I have had plenty of time to reflect on what actually took place beginning two days later. Only if we dispel some of the myths that are still in the consciousness of society may we make sound judgments on one of the greatest tragedies in United States history.
As someone who was trapped in the Superdome I learned how quickly misinformation and rumors can spread. This groupthink mentality and spreading of rumors still persists amongst those who comment, blog, write letters to the editor, and even amongst some major media outlets.
I’d like to share some of the major myths regarding New Orleans and Katrina, all of which have been researched and disproved.
“Residents had many days to evacuate from the storm.” In reality and in major weather reports, it wasn’t until two days before Katrina hit landfall that there were indications that it would head to New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf coast.
“Those who chose to stay got what they deserved.” Actually, most disaster preparedness officials say that the evacuation in such a short time period in New Orleans was one of the highest percentages ever achieved. Also, few Americans realize that the Airport, Amtrak, and Greyhound all shut down a day prior to the mandatory evacuation. Many of us could therefore not get out of town.
“Those 100 school buses that we saw flooded in the pictures should have been used to bus the evacuees out.” First off, only a bit more than half of those buses were in an operable state. Secondly, even if all could have been used it would have only made a small dent in the total number of residents and tourists stranded. Finally, many of those same people who proclaim that these should have been used fail to tell us who in the world would drive these since most of those local bus drivers had already evacuated with their families.
“There was widespread raping and murdering in the Superdome and shooting at helicopters outside of the Dome.” Weeks later public officials involved directly in this could verify no murders, no rapes, and no shooting at helicopters. Unfortunately this initial fear-based reporting adversely affected how many Americans viewed the residents of New Orleans, most likely increasing racism, ignorance, and reducing compassion.
“New Orleans sits below sea level and offers little to our nation and its economy so why rebuild it?” Actually, half of New Orleans is at or above sea level according to Tulane and Xavier Universities. As for the U.S., 55 percent of us in America live in counties that are protected by levees, many of which are more vulnerable to flooding than New Orleans. As for the value of New Orleans, the Port of New Orleans is the largest in the U.S. and the fourth largest in the world. It is estimated that 62 percent of the consumer spending public in our country receive our products through this port. So many consumer goods such as gasoline, seafood, coffee imports, sugar, and cotton rely heavily upon the New Orleans area for cheap distribution throughout the U.S. The city was founded in 1718, making it 292 years old, and has survived far longer than almost all towns and cities in the U.S. It is the birthplace of jazz, and home to incredible culinary creations, architecture, arts, and musicians.
“Hurricane Katrina was a Category Five natural disaster that destroyed New Orleans, leaving death and destruction.” The fact is that Katrina, a Category Three storm, arrived on 8/29, and moved on that day. The levees in New Orleans failed on 8/30. Independent engineering studies and a federal judge have all ruled that this was a civil engineering disaster; almost entirely manmade. Dr. Ray Seed of UC Berkeley went so far as to say that this was the worst engineering disaster in the world since Chernobyl.
“No one could have foreseen the severity of Katrina or the breach of the levees.” A video and transcripts were uncovered six months after Katrina that clearly showed President Bush being forewarned by Gov. Blanco, the Head of the Hurricane Center, and even FEMA Head Michael Brown saying that the levees might be breached and that this storm was very likely to be devastating. Bush seemed indifferent, said things were taken care of, and days after Katrina he stated, “No one could have foreseen the breach of the levees.” Regardless of your views of his response, this video and transcripts caught him in a lie and fully warned.
These lies and misinformation cannot just be swept under the rug. Nor can we just move on. When a democracy fails to hold those accountable for their mistakes and when society keeps perpetuating misinformation we do not take steps to improve our infrastructure and planning. How many other Army Corps of Engineers levees must fail for us to reconsider our priorities in society? How long can we allow certain bloggers or journalists to increase anger towards poor and minority people based on false information?
I have many conservative friends who have since confessed to me that they would have shown much more compassion and understanding towards New Orleans residents if they had not heard of all the exaggerations in the media about what went on after Katrina. Ironically, as evidenced by a large number of New Orleans Police Officers under investigation for killing innocent unarmed citizens, it seems that local residents may have had far more to fear from their own police than from their neighbors. I urge all Americans to take some time to reflect and really educate yourselves on what took place, what still needs to be changed, and how your family and you can better prepare for such incidents. Furthermore, it’s up to us to hold our media and our elected officials accountable for their actions or inaction and decide if we want to continue to spend billions of our tax dollars on a Gulf area thousands of miles from our own border at the expense of our own U.S. Gulf.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday marks the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, yet there still remains a hole in the ground where the World Trade Center was desecrated, and many of the courageous rescue workers from this tragic event still go without adequate healthcare for injuries caused. Instead, we appear to be concentrating all our energies on two blocks around the corner at a site where one can’t even see Ground Zero. It is ironic that we have failed to memorialize by corrupting our memories with the rhetoric of hatred and fear.
The construction of the Park 51 Muslim community center in Manhattan is not just about an established legal right to build the site, nor is the issue solely one of preserving multicultural values. Rather, in addition to both of these rationales, it is imperative that the site be built in order to engage Americans in a dialectic of what it means to be American and how to best preserve our future security.
If the 9/11 attacks are seen as the culmination of an era of terror imposed upon the United States, then it is crucial to ensure that such an event never occur again. The best place to curb the hatred that provokes terror is at home. There is no definitive reason why a Muslim living in America would wake up one morning and decide that he is no longer an American, but instead, a jihadist fighting a sacred war against his newly perceived enemy. Nevertheless, there is a post-9/11 trend of American Muslims converting to terrorism. In 2009, Fort Hood witnessed American-born army major Nidal Malik Hassan kill 13 of his comrades in a shooting spree. On May 1 of this year, Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized American citizen, attempted to detonate a crude car bomb in Times Square.
The very act of terrorism is an act of generalizing on the basis of ignorance. Innocent people are attacked because they are labeled and hated for the policies of a larger and more powerful entity. Islam is much bigger than the extremism that pollutes and degrades its name. Therefore, we must not generalize on the basis of such fear or resentment, because to do so would cause a retreat from our goal of inclusion. The logic of former Republican Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, that “there should be no mosque near ground zero so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia,” again reduces America to values that don’t define to our inclusive state.
It is for this very reason that President Obama followed President Bush’s rhetoric that the war on terrorism is not to be perceived as a war on Islam. In May, the White House published its national security strategy, which outlines that one way to guard against radicalization at home is to ensure diversity as a strength of America, not as a source of division, insecurity, tension, or fear. Perhaps it is due to the extensive religiosity of the United States, or perhaps due to the principle  of separation of church and state, but America has throughout history been a nation of welcoming embrace to followers of Islam, and it must remain so not only for the sake of its values but also for the sake of self-interest. America is safer if its Muslims feel included, incorporated, and overall American, instead of isolated and polarized because of their identity.
Any argument opposing the Cordoba House inherently leans on the false notion that all Muslims are implicated in the atrocities of September 11. To argue that this site is “insensitive” is to contend that Islam, over anything else—crude or whatnot—that resides in Manhattan, is offensive to the American ideal of the preservation of freedom. This is to generalize and target Islam, as well as to forget all of the innocent Muslims that died on September 11, 2001.
The community center is inspired by New York’s 92nd Street Young Men’s Christian Association, a Jewish community center that also reaches out to other religions. Its site was selected precisely as an attempt to deal with some of the wounds caused by the attacks on the Twin Towers and the events that have since followed. To be hurt by the construction of this site makes sense only if one buys the false idea that Muslims in general were perpetrators of the atrocities.
The best way to commemorate the victims of September 11, therefore, would be to honor them rather than to create an enemy. We must maintain the values that made these people American, and we must build the Cordoba House.

Students scavenging for caffeine at Crema Cafe or searching to quell a sugar fix at Hidden Sweets may have noticed Harvard Square’s own “Green Monster,” a large construction pit blockaded by fences covered in green tarp. The tarps conceal a construction project that will result in a renovated staircase, as well as a new elevator connecting the Brattle Square Plaza to the Red Line Upper Bus Platform.
The project is on time and is expected to reach completion in the coming spring, said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
The renovation began as a result of a 2006 settlement of a class action ADA lawsuit filed by Greater Boston Legal Services on behalf of 11 individual plaintiffs and the Boston Center for Independent Living. As part of the settlement, the Masssachusetts Bay Transportation Authority agreed to spend $122 million over five years to upgrade and replace elevators and escalators at selected locations, including Harvard Square.
Dust and noise from the ongoing construction have disrupted several Brattle Street stores.
“Nobody likes it but everyone understands that it is necessary and required and they could not have performed better than they are right now,” Jillson said. “We are welcome to the project because we want Harvard Square to be welcome to all people.”
According to Liza Baer-Kahn, one of the owners of Crema Cafe, business has not been badly affected.
“We haven’t been terribly hurt—it just affects the environment of our customers and how pleasant it is for our customers, but we understood it had to get done,” Baer-Kahn said.
Construction on Brattle Street follows the recent completion of the renovated crosswalks across Brattle and coincides with the current reconstruction of DeGuglielmo Plaza, the site of the construction.
The project will lead to significant improvement in infrastructure, according to Katherine F. Watkins, supervising engineer at the Cambridge Department of Public Works. The renovated site will place an emphasis on keeping the design open and lending visibility to businesses that line the street.
Similar construction projects sparked by the settlement are also taking place at Park Street, Downtown Crossing, and Porter Square.

In a quiet ceremony in May, a team of Harvard professors, graduate students, and undergraduates announced the completion of the Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations—an interactive online database that gives students and scholars access to a wealth of previously unavailable information.
The atlas—which claims to provide analysis on “all aspects” of Western Eurasian civilizations in the first 1500 years of modern history—maps subjects such as the Roman road network, the voyages of the Crusades, and the path of the rats that spread the bubonic plague.
In the 1990s, history professor Michael McCormick first conceived of the idea while working on a book on communication and commerce. At one point, in order to understand the circuitous route the Vikings took in their various explorations, McCormick wanted to see the world as it would have appeared to medieval Norsemen.
The only problem was that no such maps existed, with or without a Scandinavian focus.
“Every year since the 17th century, at least five maps of the Roman Empire have been made,” McCormick said. “But why do we have to keep making the same map over and over again?”
After several years of using such maps, McCormick was awarded a small amount of funding from the Office of the Provost to create maps that would supplement his undergraduate course on the Roman Empire. After a trial run with those maps proved successful, McCormick and his team began to create maps for his other courses. In 2006, however, the project’s reach expanded even further.
“Four years ago, we realized that we had created something that would be useful to scholars and students around the world,” said McCormick, who had by then begun collaborating with Chinese history professor Peter Bol and research associate Guoping Huang of the Center for Geographic Analysis, and a cadre of 20 graduate and undergraduate students.
Later, McCormick won a $1.5 million distinguished achievement award from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation, which has funded large portions of the project.
Although the atlas’s information became available online just before the beginning of this academic year, the team now has plans to allow free downloads of all its basic data sets. McCormick said he hopes his team’s efforts will help to expand the knowledge pool even further.
According to medieval historian Daniel L. Smail, McCormick’s atlas is “particularly useful” because the field of medieval studies “is so scattered.”
“Historians in this period are very much like Sherlock Holmes—we tend to have to work by inference,” Smail said. “Something like the digital atlas has an added value that gives us statistical correlations that we couldn’t see before.”
For the undergraduates involved, the project provided a chance to conduct real historical research with a senior Harvard professor.
“[The atlas] was a great opportunity to see how to get involved with history research,” said Brendan Maione-Downing ’13, who plans to concentrate in history with a secondary field in archaeology.
“It’s much more difficult to see how you get involved with history research than it is with scientific research,” he added. “It was a really exciting thing to do so early on.”

After a dip in hiring rates amid the financial crisis, Harvard Law School graduates’ employment prospects are steadily improving.
According to the Office of Career Services, 95 percent of the class of 2010 secured employment by graduation, a figure in line with the office’s  predictions and consistent with Law School employment rates from the last 15 years.
As a result of the financial crisis, many recent graduates received “deferred” start dates—generally 6 months to a year after graduation—from their employers. Although Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark A. Weber said deferrals are expected to drop this year, the backlog from previous years has left fewer spaces for new graduates.
“Imagine there was a snowstorm at Logan Airport a few days ago. Now it is sunny outside, but the passenger is being told it will take several days to get out because of backlog,” Weber said. “That’s exactly what has been happening in the marketplace right now.”
But not every firm is experiencing the deferral domino effect.
“Our pipeline is completely clear,” said Michael J. Summersgill, the chair of the hiring committee for the Boston office of law firm WilmerHale.
All of the 25 summer associates at WilmerHale’s Boston office received offers of full-time employment without deferral.
Last year, firms nationwide extended offers of full-time employment to only 69 percent of their summer associates, according to the National Association for Law Placement. In 2005, the “offer rate” was 90.6 percent.
Weber said he believes the percentage will rise this year, primarily because firms are simply taking fewer summer associates. According to Weber, the number of summer associate positions offered this year was down about 44 percent nationally.
“Before the financial crisis, [hiring] was overly inflated. Jobs were being given out like candy,” said second year Law School student Sarah E. Davis. “Now hiring is at a more realistic level.”
Clerkship applications have also risen over the past several years as students attempt to delay the job search process in the hopes that the market will improve.
The biggest spike in clerkship applications is among recent graduates, not current students. According to Law School Professor David B. Wilkins ’77, alumni may look to clerkships as an exit option in the case that corporate firms begin declining.
A clerkship is an extra credential, and “credentials are a way to protect yourself against uncertainty,” Wilkins said.
According to Weber, the challenging job market is something law students will have to get used to, at least for the time being. “This is just what the new ‘normal’ will look like for the next couple years,” he said.
After a dip during the recession period, starting salaries also appear to be creeping back up. In 2008, some firms scaled back their starting salaries—for example, from about $160,000 to $145,000 at a large corporate firm—to avoid cutting additional positions. This year many of those firms are returning to their original starting salaries, perhaps in an effort to remain competitive employers, according to Wilkins.
Along with higher salaries, Wilkins also predicts that summer associates and new hires will likely be expected to work more hours per week than in the past.
“[Prospective students] have to be a little more careful about their decision to go into law school because a job isn’t as much of a guarantee as it used to be,” Davis said.

Republican candidate Barbara T. Bush is running unopposed in the primary election for the Middlesex, Suffolk and Essex State Senate seat. She will face either Democratic incumbent Sal N. DiDomenico or his challenger Timothy R. Flaherty following the Sept. 14 primary for the state seat.
According to Bush, her political platform rests on three points—lowering taxes to incentivize self-sufficiency, providing more private sector jobs, and encouraging a small, fiscally conservative government to minimize business regulations.
“Lower taxes enable more citizens to have more of their money, which enables businesses to have more money to work with, which will expand business,” Bush said. “I will do whatever I can to ensure that we have laws that people will support and that we spend money wisely—after all, it’s the people’s money.”
Bush, a resident of Charlestown who has lived in both Boston and Cambridge for more than 40 years, decided to run for the Senate after a conversation she had at the Massachusetts Republican Party Headquarters.
“I was getting concerned with the way things were going in the state as well as in the country,” Bush said. “As a result of the conversation, I thought ‘Why shouldn’t I run?’”
“I wanted to do something myself,” she added.
Chairman of the Cambridge Republican City Committee Henry R. Irving said he fully supported Bush’s straightforward platform, noting that she “sticks to basic Republican principles” and “feels the call of public service.”
“I admire her energy and willingness to get out there and put herself forward; it takes a lot of nerve,” Irving said. “She approaches [campaigning] in a sensible way, she’s a good candidate, and I think she has a chance, given Scott Brown and the enthusiasm for conservative values, but time will tell.”
Bush said she considers her lack of political work experience “a big plus,” as it allows to contribute her experiences from working in the private sector. Bush taught high school and middle school in Nigeria as a Peace Corps Volunteer, then worked for 30 years in the mainframe computer industry before retiring in 2002.
Bush’s largely self-run campaign team consists of a close friend’s husband serving as treasurer and various volunteers who help her stuff envelopes. Their biggest challenge in the campaign will be pushing for greater visibility in governance, she said.
“I go knock on doors myself,” Bush said. “I think people want to meet me and not people working for me. I care about what they have to say.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Armed with a biodiesel van, a 31-year-old solar panel, and a historic mission, Harvard affiliates and eco-friendly enthusiasts gathered at the Park Street School in Beacon Hill yesterday morning as part of a four-day road trip to the White House.
Their objective: to return a solar panel that once sat atop the presidential building to its home.
The campaign, called “Put Solar on It,” was founded by William E. McKibben ’82, a former president of The Crimson, and launched with 350.org, an international campaign to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 350 parts per million—the benchmark to cure the climate crisis.
President Jimmy Carter had installed solar panels on the White House in 1979, but they were removed to Unity College in Maine by President Ronald Reagan seven years later.
This road trip, which started on Sept. 7 at Unity College, will deliver one of the solar panels back to its home on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
The goal of yesterday’s press conference in Boston was to “focus publication attention for the need to immediate and bold solutions to the climate crisis,” said Craig S. Altemose, who graduated from Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School graduate in 2010 and has been involved with the 350.org campaign. “We have the technology. We just need to get to work and make it happen.”
Yesterday’s stop used the Park Street School in Boston as an example of innovative eco-friendly reform.
The school, founded by John Zvara 10 years ago, underwent a green renovation five years ago, when two thermal solar panels were installed on its rooftop.
The installation process and hardware cost $15,000, according to Zvara, who is now seeking a major grant that would fund the installation of electric solar panels.
“It’s wonderful what the Park Street School is doing,” said Samuel B. Novey ’11, a member of the 350.org initiative. “If an elementary school can do it, why can’t the president?”
The press conference at Park Street was also attended by Mac D’Alessandro, a Massachusetts Democratic candidate for U.S. Congress. D’Alessandro echoed the need for the U.S. government to play a leadership role in this green initiative.
“It’s great to see Park Street School do this, but we need to do this on a larger scale,” D’Alessandro said.
The van is now headed toward New York City before bringing the solar panel back to its home in Washington, D.C. and is set to arrive tomorrow, exactly one month before October 10, 2010—the day of the Global Work Party co-sponsored by 350.org where the world will spend the day working on climate solutions.
“The science says that political reality needs to follow physical reality,” Altemose said. “There’s no ‘ctrl-z’ button for climate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jacob A. Brandt ’14, Kyle E. Rawding ’14, and James Brooks ’14 all play guitar and piano.
Da-Bin  Ryu ’14 wanted to live with an international student, and Samantha M.  Barkowski ’14 went to Jordan and traveled to Kuwait during her gap year.  Their third roommate, Sarah Abushaar ’14, is from Kuwait.
And Shirley Z. Ai ’14, Shee Mungai ’14, and Shelbi Olson ’14—well, their names show part of their common thread.
While  this final group’s similarity is a coincidence, the fact that these  roommates have similar—but not too similar, they say—personalities and  interests is the product of a careful and unusually nuanced process, in  which resident deans hand-select rooming assignments for freshmen.
COLORS AND CARTOONS
The day is June 10, and Resident Dean of Freshmen  Sue Brown embarks upon what will be a five-week quest: sorting 398  first-years into rooms in Grays, Matthews, and Weld Halls.
Much of  this task remains the same as it has been in years past. She sorts  freshmen largely by hand, thoroughly reading incoming freshmen’s  responses to roommate questionnaires. During the process, her floor is  covered with a mass of paper that is eventually divided into nine  distinct piles—one of the early steps in the lengthy matchmaking  process.
But in the midst of that process, technology rears its head. In Adobe  Acrobat, Brown categorizes freshmen, using colors to sort the incoming  students by geography and stamping the freshmen’s rooming surveys with  various logos made in Photoshop. A cartoon of a chess piece marks a  chess player. A compass is reserved for the “curious and adventurous”  freshman, Brown says.
Emblazoned with colors and cartoons, the surveys are printed out and  scattered on a floor in Brown’s home. From there, she divides the  students into three categories based on students’ self-reported levels  of sociability.
Social tendencies are one of the most important factors in determining  roommate compatibility “because it’s going to be something that will  come between roommates before they ever really get to know each other,”  she says.
But other factors matter as well, Brown adds. From the sleeping habits  freshmen keep and the sports they play, to the neatness they maintain  and the number of roommates they want, the resident deans take into  account a slew of determinants of each first-year’s personality.
Some factors, like musical tastes, are often stronger predictors of compatibility than others, according to Brown.
“If you can find a group of guys who all like rap and country/western,” she says, “you think, ‘They might get along.’”
ATHLETICS AND ARABIC
A group of guys lives in Matthews, and they all like rap and country music. And so far, they get along great.
Occupying  a room on the third floor of Matthews, Colin T. Quirk ’14 says he wrote  on his housing survey that he wanted to live with two athletes. One of  his roommates, Tyler Ott ’14, is a tight end on the Harvard football  team. And his other roommate, Cameron J. Croy ’14, was wearing a dappled  gray t-shirt that read “Property of Harvard Wrestling” while being  interviewed.
Brown “couldn’t have matched [them] up better,” Croy says.
Another  key to their match is their hometowns. Ott is from Oklahoma and Croy is  from Tennessee, while Quirk is from Boston. Resident deans often try to  place local freshmen with those from outside the area, especially  international students for whom going home during vacations is more  difficult, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
To go home for long weekends or vacations, Abushaar would have to travel  for more than 12 hours to her home in Kuwait. On the other hand,  Abushaar’s roommate, Barkowski, is from Dorchester, Mass., only a  20-minute drive away.
At Harvard, Barkowski said she wants to study Arabic, and  Ryu, Abushaar and Barkowski's roommate, also expressed an interest in  diversity on her rooming survey.
“We’re both very interested in languages and foreign cultures,” she says of Barkowski and herself.
Across  from Matthews in Weld Hall, six language aficionados live in a suite.  Together, the six women speak English, French, Italian, Spanish, Creole,  Korean, and Telegu.
They hail from all over the Western hemisphere, but despite their  geographic and cultural differences, the six exuberant freshmen say they  are already incredibly close.
“We like having each other,” Medha-Kameswari Gargeya ’14 says. “They’re kind of like my security blanket.”
COMFORT AND COHABITATION
The security blanket may be a comfort, but  the primary goal of the Freshman Dean’s Office, says Dingman, is  twofold—to ensure that freshmen “feel a level of comfort in going home  every day” while still allowing them to “grow and learn from one  another.”
Roommates Sheyda Aboii ’14 and Stephanie Charles ’14 said they had a  “really enlightening” conversation about Haiti’s history after Aboii  shopped Societies of the World 25: “Health, Culture and Community: Case  Studies in Global Health.” Charles is from Haiti, and one of the  course’s instructors is Harvard Medical School professor Paul E. Farmer,  known for his work in Haiti with his non-profit health care  organization Partners In Health.
But despite the FDO’s best efforts, their matches are not always perfect.
Every  year, a small margin of freshmen—”about half a dozen”—are switched out  of their original suites after approaching the FDO, Dingman says. Many  more choose to block with and live with others in future years.
Still, Brown says a successful rooming match does not require cohabitants to be best friends.
“It’s  not that we want to create these perfect little lifelong friendships,  although I’m happy to hear when that does happen,” she says. “We’re okay  with good working relationships, although we prefer it to be a little  more dynamic than that.”
After organizing the rooms, the deans turn to assembling the entryways.
“You want it to be a diverse group, a microcosm of the freshman class,” Brown says.
But  at the same time, the entryway can’t be so diverse that a student feels  isolated. For example, the FDO tries to avoid placing only one  international student in any entryway, Brown says. She also avoids  putting two students from the same varsity sport or the same high school  in a single entryway.
REQUESTING RESPECT
Despite the deans’ detailed perusal of freshmen  rooming surveys, roommates don’t always need to share uncanny  similarities—like a love of trivia or the ability to speak French—in  order to get along.
Some people say virtually nothing in their rooming application, making  them more difficult to match with other freshmen who share their  specific interests, Dingman says. Incoming freshmen request intangible  traits like respect, balance, and humor just as often as they list  detailed preferences in their rooming questionnaires.
“We had a lot of people this year, more so than in the past, just say:  ‘As long as my roommates are kind and respectful, we’ll get along just  fine,’” Brown says.

Horace Gray Lunt ’41, a revered linguist and philologist who served in the Slavic languages and literatures department for 40 years, died Aug. 11. He was 91.
While many Slavic linguists prior to Lunt were natives of the region and based their study on cultural grounds, Lunt—who was born in Colorado Springs, Co.—worked to “ensure that linguistic argumentation rested on a rational, factual basis, countering any discussion based on nationalism or demagoguery,” wrote Ukranian Professor Michael S. Flier in an obituary of Lunt for the University.
At a time when Macedonian heritage was a politically charged question, Lunt’s controversial book “A Grammar of the Macedonian Literary Language,” published in 1952, lead to a disagreement between those who viewed Macedonian as an offshoot of Bulgarian and those who viewed Macedonian as a independent language.
Lunt’s “Old Church Slavonic Grammar” and “Fundamentals of Russian”—books published in 1955 and 1957, respectively—also both became definitive works in the field.
As a professor, Lunt favored having his students work directly with texts after only a preliminary taste of the grammar they would encounter in the reading.
“It was a baptism of fire that was both intimidating and salutary,” Flier wrote.
Lunt graduated from Harvard magna cum laude, having written an honors thesis on Nobel Prize-winning poet Hermann Hesse. He left the University in 1942 to serve in the army’s Counter Intelligence Corps, during which time he interviewed Yugoslav refugees and enhanced his knowledge of Serbian, Croatian, and Slovene.
After the war, Lunt returned to Harvard, where he held a wide array of positions, including chair of the Slavic department from 1959-1974, director of the Slavic and East European Language and Area Center from 1983-1989, and member of the Executive Committee of the Ukrainian Research Institute from 1973-1991.
Though Russian was Lunt’s language of choice, he learned it only after having already mastered Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and German.
A series of prominent linguists served as Lunt’s advisors through the years, including Blaže Koneski—a Macedonian philologist who suggested Lunt write on Macedonian—and Russian structuralist Roman Jakobson, who preceded Lunt as the Samuel Hazzard Cross professor of Slavic languages and literatures.
According to Lunt’s longtime friend and MIT linguist Morris Halle, “Lunt completely commanded this field.”
A memorial for Lunt will be held on October 22 at 3:00 p.m. in Fong Auditorium.

As psychology professor Marc D. Hauser faces allegations of research misconduct—which the American Association of University Professors states may be grounds for revocation of tenure—some in the scientific community question whether Hauser should keep his teaching position at Harvard.
But a review of Harvard’s recent history of faculty scandals suggests those calling for the University to dismiss Hauser should not hold their breath.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has never begun dismissal proceedings against a faculty member because of research misconduct, according to FAS spokesman Jeff Neal.
Several incidents from the past two decades show that tenured Harvard faculty have kept their jobs, whereas junior faculty resigned from their positions.
Take the case of Shervert H. Frazier. In 1988, the then-head of the Harvard Medical School psychiatry department and the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital resigned after the school found him guilty of four instances of plagiarism, according to The Crimson’s archives.
Three months later, he was rehired by the McLean Hospital as a staff psychiatrist and received the title “psychiatrist-in-chief, emeritus.”
But junior faculty facing similar accusations of research misconduct saw their affiliation with Harvard end.
In 2009, Medical School associate clinical professor Lee S. Simon resigned after being accused of plagiarism. Harvard School of Public Health assistant professor Ali A. Sultan, also accused of plagiarism, resigned in 2004 and took a position at Cornell that same year. In 1995, Weishui Y. Weiser, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, resigned after the National Institutes of Health concluded that he had committed “falsification of data in biomedical research.”
Though some junior faculty find other appointments, others who lack the protections of tenure may not be able to continue in academia with a record of serious misconduct.
“An assistant professor or an associate professor would probably resign, with the logical outcome being that they’d lose their job anyway,” said Cathy A. Trower, research director of the Collaborative On Academic Careers in Higher Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “Some tenured professors might have decided to resign under these conditions rather than face the sanctions and the lawsuits, but they have the extra protections of tenure.”
According to Trower, a 1994 study found that between 50 and 75 tenured professors are dismissed annually nationwide. Trower said that number is unlikely to have changed since the study was published.
The AAUP states misrepresentation, falsification, and ethical or policy violations—including scientific misconduct—can all be grounds for tenure termination.
“If the administration and the faculty believe that a professor has engaged in research misconduct, certainly according to our standards, they would be in a position to initiate dismissal proceedings,” said Gregory F. Scholtz, director of the AAUP’s Department of Academic Freedom, Tenure, and Governance. “Tenure is not supposed to protect academic misconduct or academic incompetence.”
In Hauser’s case, some have suggested Harvard’s investigation, which found him “solely responsible” for eight instances of scientific misconduct, should preclude him from his teaching duties.
“One view of teaching is that you are an ambassador for the science you are teaching and for the institution at which you are teaching,” Gerry T. M. Altmann, a psychology professor at the University of York and editor of Cognition, the journal that retracted a 2002 article written by Hauser, in an e-mail to The Crimson late last month. “I personally do not believe that someone who is found guilty of misconduct is ambassador material.”
Misconduct has led to dismissals of both tenured and non-tenured faculty at Harvard’s peer institutions. In 2008, Madonna G. Constantine, a tenured professor at Columbia Teachers College, was fired for plagiarism, and in 2005, Luk Van Parijs, associate professor of biology at MIT, was dismissed after admitting to falsifying data.
But tenure terminations remain a rarity. A 2005 Yale Daily News article stated only two Yale professors have ever had their tenure revoked.
A copy of Harvard statutes revised in 2004 states that only the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, can dismiss a permanently appointed faculty member for “grave misconduct or neglect of duty.”
The Corporation can also require a faculty member to resign due to “ill health” or serious disability.
For example, during the McCarthy era, the Corporation found that Wendell H. Furry, an associate professor of physics and former member of the Communist party, had committed “grave misconduct” for providing a government agent with false information. But the Corporation stopped short of revoking his tenure because he had left the party due to the “increasing violence and untruth of its propaganda and its growing hostility to the United States,” according to a statement it made in 1953.
It is unclear whether the statutes have been revised since 2004, and a request to Neal for information on Harvard’s procedures on terminating tenure was not returned in time for this article.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, who has been on the faculty since 1962, said he could not recall a tenured professor being removed for misconduct.
“People [leave when they] don’t get tenure, but that’s a perfectly honorable departure. And often people leave for a better job. But hardly anyone is dismissed,” he said.

Harvard’s endowment grew to $27.4 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, an 11 percent investment return that comes a year after it plummeted in value by 27.3 percent to $26 billion.
Though the fund—the largest in higher education—posted a marked gain, it underperformed a theoretical benchmark portfolio that includes 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds by about two percent, according to Harvard Management Company’s annual report issued today.
While markets have broadly begun to recover after the recent financial crisis, the second half of fiscal year 2010 saw a great deal of market volatility due in large part to turmoil in the sovereign debt market sparked by concerns surrounding Greek debt. But according to HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo, the University endowment is better equipped to handle market turbulence than in the past.
“It has been a productive year,” wrote Mendillo in a report announcing the investment results. “In comparison to one year ago, our portfolio and our organization are significantly better positioned to continue to deliver strong long-term returns as well as actively manage our risks.”
According to the report, University money managers have continued to retool the portfolio to increase its liquidity, a move that gives managers more flexibility after the recent financial crisis found the University with a need for cash but unable to sell off illiquid assets.
HMC had previously invested heavily in alternative assets, which saw huge gains in the run up to the financial crisis but quickly dropped in value in the aftermath of the housing market’s crash and proved difficult to remarket.
“Senior management at HMC has been working closely with the University this year, and I believe all would agree that we have achieved deeper understanding of appropriate risk parameters and better alignment of the endowment’s risk/return profile with the University’s goals and needs,” Mendillo wrote.
Over the past two years the University has decreased its uncalled capital commitments from $11 billion to $6.5 billion, a change that further increases fund liquidity by decreasing the amount of money pledged to external managers in the future.
The past year has also seen HMC strengthen its risk management division, an effort that included hiring Neil Mason as Chief Risk Officer.
While emphasizing that HMC has taken strides to align its priorities more closely with the University’s, Mendillo’s letter sounded a note of caution.
“We also need to be mindful that our portfolio, while large, still operates under liquidity constraints and spending demands that are great than they were 5-10 years ago,” Mendillo wrote, adding that the endowment spending now accounts for 35 percent of Harvard’s budget.
Despite the scare of two years ago, the endowment has continued to invest in unusual asset classes such as natural resources including timber and agricultural land, a sector which continued to outperform its benchmarks.
Notwithstanding August media reports that HMC was considering selling a large chunk of its real estate investments, managers are focusing on the sector as an area with room for growth. Harvard’s real estate portfolio underperformed its benchmark, today’s report said, but HMC has strengthened its team in the area to prepare for future opportunities.
“The repositioning of our real estate portfolio will take several years, but it began in earnest this year with several new investments outside of the traditional LP fund structure,” Mendillo wrote.
The global financial crisis and increasing government regulation of financial firms have also had peripheral benefits for HMC.
The endowment has hired a number of managers seeking refuge from Wall Street as banks trim staff.
“The environment for attracting investment talent and experience to HMC has been favorable over the last two years and we have taken advantage of this opportunity,” Mendillo wrote.

Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has secured his first recruit in the class of 2011. Jonah Travis, a 6’6, 220-lb combo forward at DeLaSalle High School (Minneapolis, Minn.) verbally committed to the Crimson last month.
Carrying about 20 Division-I offers from schools across the country—including Cornell, Northwestern, Boise State, Wofford, Lafayette, Bowling Green, and Miami of Ohio—Travis is rated a 90 by ESPN and No. 44 at his position nationally.
“He should be a great pick-up for Harvard,” said Kevin Alsteens, editor of Twin Cities Boys Hoops, where he has Travis ranked fourth in the Minnesota class of 2011. “‘Relentless’ is probably the one word I‘d use to describe him—either that, or ‘fearless.’ One hundred percent effort all the time, a great motor.”
Called by the NBE Basketball Report “a long kid with athleticism and three-point range,” Travis said his role with the Crimson will likely be that of a three or four, depending on the match-up.
Jeremy Miller, Travis’s coach on the AAU squad Pump N Run, agreed with the hard-nosed forward’s assessment of his game.
“If he gets a chance to play the four, I think coaches will pull him away from the basket and let him take bigger guys off the bounce, which he’s very capable of doing,” Miller said. “He’s going to be able to finish over bigger and stronger players with his strength and his athleticism. And if you put any guy 6’6” or smaller on him, he will destroy anyone on the block his height or smaller.”
“He’s the best rebounder in Minnesota—he’s great on the offensive glass and the defensive glass,” Miller added. “He brings a toughness to any team that he plays for. The coaches that were recruiting him this past spring said that he plays harder than anyone that they saw all summer. The kid just doesn’t know any other way than full speed. He’s athletic, he’s great in the paint, and he’s developing his perimeter skills—taking guys off the bounce and his outside shooting.”
Travis said the main factor behind his decision was his unofficial visit to campus during early August.
“I got to experience everything, got to talk with the coaches, had a great time with the coaches,” Travis said. “The number one overall thing was probably the coaching staff...I really got to feel how I would be treated and how badly they wanted me there. I just couldn’t say no. Everything was just so great—I just loved it out there.”
Travis will be returning to Cambridge next weekend to accompany the high-level trio of recruits that Amaker is welcoming to campus.
“I’ve been texting Andre Hollins a couple times,” Travis said. “Hopefully we can get him in a jersey with me.”
Kenyatta Smith and Spencer Dinwiddie are also expected to visit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Isn't shopping period fun? For many, it means minimal academic work, maximal social life, and hoping for the best when school really starts to pick up.
A lot of Ivy League teams seem to take similar strategies in out-of-conference play. What could be more fun than winning an easy blow-out victory over a winless team? Of course, easy victories aren't necessarily the best way to prepare for the wear and tear of the conference season.
In this edition of the Back Page, we look at five Ivy teams which have had some success in the early season. One team will coast to an Easy A, two will have to cram for the occasional midterm, and two will end up pulling frequent all-nighters, wondering how the could have misread the Q guide so badly.
It seemed as if the entire campus erupted when No. 10 Harvard topped No. 13 Stanford in men's soccer, but up north, fans clad in green have had reason to celebrate as well. Up in Hanover, NH, the Dartmouth men used four second half goals to top Holy Cross, 4-1. The Big Green women, meanwhile, posted a 1-0 victory over Northeastern. A year ago, the Huskies and the Crimson both beat Brown by the same score, 1-0. Meanwhile, Harvard's men's and women's soccer teams both beat their Dartmouth counterparts by a score of 2-1 last fall. The women's team's victory over Northeastern likely precludes another close match, while the men's victory does little to indicate what will happen when the Crimson and Big Green tangle once more. Dartmouth's road through the Ancient Eight will be anything but easy, but the Big Green has what it takes for another competitive year on both the women's and men's sides.
League juggernaut Princeton doesn't look to be slowing down any in field hockey. The Tigers, which blanked Harvard 9-0 en route to a run to the NCAA semifinals, were picked fourth in the Kookaburra/NFHCA Division I Preseason Poll and opened their season with a 7-0 victory over Bucknell on Saturday. The winless Bison likely won't be the last to suffer such a fate at the hands of Princeton. Expect the Tigers accumulate easy conference victories and make another deep run in the postseason.
Speaking of 7-0 wins over winless opponents, the Cornell women's soccer team had some fun this past Saturday against Delaware State, toppling the Hornets by that same score. If Delaware State had a better record, the win might signal some change in the Ivy League hierarchy. But the Hornets had already lost 7-0 before they fell to the Big Red and lost 6-0 the game before. So Cornell's big win probably won't translate into Ivy dominance down the road.
Meanwhile in Philadelphia, the Quakers men’s soccer team topped winless La Salle by a score of 5-0 on the same Saturday. Last year, Penn finished tied for fifth in the league with a 2-4-1 record. The Quakers played well in some games, pushing the Crimson to the limit in a 1-0 loss. But more often, Penn was defined by mediocrity, and the win over the Explorers doesn't suggest any change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How I Spent My Summer Vacation.” Everyone’s favorite third-grade assignment.
And while we may be wistful for the days when we could write about summer camp or lying on the beach, Harvard students seem to get a bit more out of vacation these days—and Crimson athletes are no exception. Whether on the pitch, field, or pool deck, Harvard standouts left their mark all across the world this summer.
“If you’re serious about baseball, it’s expected that...you should play summer ball,” said junior pitcher Brent Suter, who logged a league-high 49.2 innings in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League in his home state of Ohio. At the Division I level, the same holds true for numerous sports.
Six female Crimson swimmers avoided the offseason letdown by competing in the US National Championships, and two of the athletes—co-captain Kate Mills and junior Meghan Leddy—quickly dispelled any notion that the event was just a training exercise. The pair notched top-30 finishes in the 200-meter butterfly and 200 backstroke, respectively, earning invites to the US Olympic Trials.
And they weren’t the only stars to shine on the water. Half a world away, Harvard rowers took Belarus by storm, bringing home hardware from the 2010 U-23 World Championships. Assisted by Crimson men’s lightweight coach Linda Muri, three American women’s boats took gold at the four-day event, and co-captain Liv Coffey figured prominently in the bow seat of the victorious eight-woman boat.
“It’s always really exciting traveling with the team and representing the US,” said Coffey, who joined the American team in Prague last year as well.
But despite the accolades for Coffey, Leddy, and Mills, the success of summer is not judged on honors alone. As the crew captain noted, the daunting national team camp, which ran from June 1 to the end of July with just one off day, proved invaluable in maintaining the team members’ skills.
“There’s no substitute for rowing...so if you can never stop working out, you’re at your best,” Coffey said. “It’s great if you can maintain a level [of fitness] and push really hard when you have to in the spring.”
And sometimes, the victory is not even staying in peak form, but just being able to return to it. Senior pitcher Max Perlman garnered his own fair share of summer honors—earning a place on the Cape Cod Baseball League All-Star Team for his work with the Wareham Gatemen—but for the Harvard right-hander, the more important accomplishment was proving that he could once again dominate on the mound after elbow surgery.
“I just needed to play. It had been so long since I had pitched a full season,” Perlman said. “The Cape helped me find my rhythm and find my mechanics.”
Perlman certainly had his arsenal of pitches working, as he quieted some of the best hitting prospects in college baseball to the tune of a 1.92 ERA. The Crimson ace fanned 42 opposing hitters in 51.1 innings, good for fifth in the league, and, perhaps more impressively, walked just six batters—a sign of greatly improved command.
“I think I got a feel for all my pitches that I didn’t have initially coming back from surgery,” he said.
If Perlman can maintain this form throughout the year, Harvard may have a formidable 1-2 punch atop its rotation, as Suter found equal success in his Great Lakes outings.
The junior hurler put up staggering numbers en route to being named the GLL’s pitcher of the year and top pitching prospect.
Suter went undefeated over the summer, leading all pitchers with a 1.27 ERA and 47 strikeouts, simply gaudy numbers compared to his sophomore season.
Last spring, in the exact same number of innings, Suter allowed almost twice as many hits while posting an ERA of 5.26.
“My philosophy was better [over the summer],” he said. “I was spotting my off-speed pitches, and they were moving more than they used to.”
Clearly, Suter was not intimidated by the lineups featuring Big 10, MAC, and A-10 hitters. With a sterling summer under his belt, the lefty knows that 2011 in the Ivy League can be more of the same.
“It’s very valuable to be able to come back this fall with a lot more experience,” Suter said. “The confidence aspect is huge. I want to go out and keep the team in the ballgame every time.”
And in the end, this ability to help their teams may be the ultimate motivating factor for Crimson summer athletes. When they could have pursued the intense internships that fascinate so many of their peers, these competitors instead honed skills that could translate to progress during the season.
“There are a lot of great things the national team does,” Coffey said. “The women have done really well recently, and there’s a style of training we can bring back to school.”
It may not have been as fun as beach time, but at the start of the season these athletes may find that a few more breaks go their way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshmen aren’t the only rookies on the varsity fields this year.
Four new head coaches have been hired to lead Harvard teams­—in men’s soccer, water polo, men’s lacrosse, and squash respectively. Although their achievements make up an impressive list of qualifications, there is one thing they all lack: prolonged time as a head coach at the collegiate level.
But is previous college coaching experience necessary to be successful?
At the helm of men’s soccer, Carl Junot is already showing results.
After last season’s head coach Jamie Clark, the 2009 NSCAA Northeast Region Coach of the Year, resigned, Junot was chosen to fill his shoes. Junot served as a Harvard assistant coach for the last two seasons and as the Tufts head coach for three months before returning to lead the Crimson program.
Already he’s led tenth-ranked Harvard to victories over No. 13 Stanford and UMass, and the squad shows no signs of slowing down.
Crimson players feel that Junot’s personality and familiarity with the Harvard program outweigh any lack of head coaching experience.
“All the players thought it would be a good idea to have someone who was close to the program and had an idea what the players were like,” said sophomore forward Brian Rogers over the summer. “[Junot] definitely has an enthusiasm about the game that’s contagious [and] that everyone seems to respond to really well.”
New water polo coach Ted Minnis similarly inspires his players. Minnis has experience at the youth, club, and high school levels, but he is getting his feet wet for the first time at the college ranks with the Crimson.
Although the men’s team has started off with a 1-2 record after last weekend’s MIT Invitational, responses from his players have been enthusiastic about Minnis’ coaching style.
“Ted has brought a new energy to the team that I think all the returning players and new players have responded to really well,” co-captain Bret Voith said. “Ted has been able to come in and get everyone excited to play this year...Even though he hasn’t coached at the college level, at the club level he has coached with some of the best coaches in the country, and he is fully ready to lead our team.”
“He is one of those people who has a natural charisma,” sophomore center Elise Molnar added.  “A lot of those close games really come down to having someone who can motivate you to that next level. I think Ted will be able to do that for us.”
On the lacrosse field, Chris Wojcik hopes to bring his knowledge of the game to motivate the players of his alma mater. The former Harvard captain went on to serve as an assistant coach for the Crimson and Bowdoin before joining Penn as the top assistant coach and recruiting coordinator. His new position allows him to return to Harvard Stadium once again, but this time, at the top of the staff.
“It’s been a dream come true,” said Wojcik shortly after receiving the position. “I hoped at some point down the road that I was going to be the head coach at Harvard.”
He already has plans to speed up the squad’s style of play and is enthusiastic about continuing to improve the program.
Rounding out the fresh faces is Mike Way, the new head coach of the men’s and women’s squash teams. With over 25 years of professional coaching experience, including time at the National Squash Training Center in Canada and at the Oakville Club, Way has trained and developed over 50 world and national champions, including Crimson sophomore Laura Gemmell. Although he has never coached an American college team, Way is definitely not lacking in experience.
“He is world-renowned and is very knowledgeable about the game,” Gemmell said. “I don’t know anyone who knows strategy and tactics better than him.”
Way’s strengths are not only limited to his knowledge of the game.
“He is super inspiring,” Gemmell continued. “He brings a lot of passion and enthusiasm. He has already brought a lot of new energy to the team.”
These four men may not have experience as head coaches at the college level. But will this make a difference? They are experts in their respective sports. They have trained competitive athletes at high levels. They are passionate and inspiring. Only time will tell, but with these coaches in the lead, the future seems bright for these Harvard programs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard men’s basketball players have spent the preseason working on ball handling and perfecting their jump shots, freshman point guard Matt Brown has been enduring a different kind of preseason workout. Instead of setting screens and throwing bounce passes in pickup games, Brown has been running passing routes and catching footballs as a wide receiver on the Crimson’s football team.
Brown—the first basketball recruit from the class of 2014 to commit to play for head coach Tommy Amaker—decided last month that one sport just wasn’t enough. So the heavily recruited high school football and basketball player decided to join the football team, making him Harvard’s lone male two-sport athlete.
“I think I’m capable of playing both,” Brown said. “Not too many people have the ability or the opportunity, so I thought, ‘Why not give it a shot?’”
At Northfield Mount Herman in western Massachusetts, Brown had little trouble balancing the two sports. As a high school senior, Brown spearheaded his football team’s offense as the starting running back while also running the point on the school’s nationally recognized basketball team.
When it came to picking a college, Brown’s options included offers from Notre Dame and Boston College to play football, and he was hearing from Providence and Stanford about basketball.
While most high school athletes in Brown’s shoes choose only one sport to focus on in college, Brown had different ideas.
“Playing two sports in college was always sort of in the back of my mind,” Brown said. “So when I was looking at schools, I always thought, ‘Would that be a place where I would have an opportunity to play both?’”
At most schools, the answer was ‘No.’ Even if coaches told Brown he would have the opportunity to play both, Brown suspected it was just a ploy to get him to commit.
“Some of [the ACC, Big East, and Pac-10] schools said that they would give me the option, but honestly I didn’t really believe them,” Brown said. “When the [Crimson] basketball program first started recruiting me, my dad and I had a conversation with Amaker and asked if I would have the opportunity to play both. And he said, ‘I’ll give you a shot. I’ll let you try it out.’”
One year after Brown committed to the Harvard basketball program following his junior year of high school, Amaker stayed true to his word.
Throughout the summer, Brown vacillated between whether or not he should play both sports, weighing the pros—getting a chance to continue with a sport he enjoys playing—and cons—missing basketball preseason and risking injury. In early August, Brown decided the opportunity to suit up his football pads for at least one more year was too much to pass up.
Following a couple of conversations with Amaker and head football coach Tim Murphy, Brown, after spending the majority of his summer on the hardwood, found himself on the gridiron, running routes and catching passes. With the Crimson’s football opener less than two weeks away, Brown is still trying to make the transition into a collegiate wide receiver. The athleticism is already there. At 6’3, 205 pounds, Brown is not only one of the biggest wide receivers on the Harvard’s roster but also one of the quickest.
“He’s been doing really well with picking stuff up and letting his athletic ability shine through,” said senior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi. “At the top of the route, we have lots of options. Those kind of cater to him really well because he can give a juke and get past his defender.”
But before Brown sees much playing time on the Crimson’s deep wide receiving corps, he still has much to work on—namely, learning Harvard’s expansive offense.
Brown should have the playbook down pat by Nov. 20, the last day of the football season. Brown plans on finishing up the season with the football team, then transitioning to the basketball squad, which plays its first game on Nov. 13.
While Brown will miss most of the basketball preseason and will likely miss the Crimson’s first three basketball games, he still plans to put himself through individual basketball workouts in the fall.
“It’s not like I’m not going to touch a basketball until I go to practice,” Brown said. “I’m going to be as much a part of both teams as possible.”

UPDATE: Sept. 10, 2010. Mather, not Dunster (as was previously stated by the University), will be open for dinner tonight.
If you were annoyed by the unceremonious end to "Camp Harvard"  last week, you will soon have closure, followed by realization that the semester is about to start for real.
The College Events Board's annual Harvard Carnival—which was cancelled last week due to Hurricane Earl's anticlimatic sweep through town—will occur tomorrow (Friday), Sept. 10, from 5-8 p.m. All dining halls (except for Mather and Currier) will be closed for dinner during the carnival, so come hungry. We know we're looking forward to the carnival games and pork sandwiches that we missed last week, so we hope to see you all there!

As you may (or may not) have noticed, Harvard University Health services has opened a new “Center for Wellness” in the Holyoke Center, offering workshops, massages, and general information regarding well-being. If you don’t get a chance to drop by, however, you can still check out their website to see a list of programs, make appointments, or find out more about the center. We took a minute to read the “tools and tips” provided on the website and decided to translate a few into versions that are more useful for the average Harvard student.
Physical
Their version: Replace your soda, juice, or coffee with a glass of water, and you've taken one small but important step toward well-being.
Useful version: Alternate each shot of vodka, bottle of beer, or glass of wine with water, and you’ve still most likely taken in too many calories and hastened the death of your liver, but DAPA would be proud.
Behavioral
Their version: Before you can stop procrastinating, you need to figure out why you’re doing it. Most people procrastinate for one of three reasons: perfectionism, emotional avoidance, or fear.
Useful version: You’re probably procrastinating for one of three reasons: you haven’t done the reading, you don’t want to do the reading, you have better things to do besides the reading. If you’re going to forgo the work altogether, you might want to make sure that section participation isn’t a large part of your overall grade.
Spiritual
Their version: Open yourself to chance: Some choices take you exactly where you need to go; others take you by surprise. Let them. All we have is the integrity of this moment, and the calm that comes from trusting what lies ahead. 
Useful version: As shopping week comes to an end, you might have ended up with classes that will turn out just as interesting (or just as boring) as you expected. If that new gen-ed course isn’t the 4.3 Q-score you expected, hold onto the "calm that comes from trusting [that add/drop period] lies ahead."
Social
Their version: Invest in the relationships that bring meaning to your life and that you know will be with you for the long haul.
Useful version: Don’t drunkenly hook up with that kid in your entryway, your section, or your study group. It will lead to awkwardness when you run into each other and you may have to find someone else to help you with your p-sets the night before they are due.
Their Version: Active listening means devoting your attention to what someone is saying. It requires you to listen with an open mind uncluttered by inner dialogue. Concentrate on understanding what the other person is saying, not on phrasing your response.
Useful version: Don’t feel bad if you zone out when "that kid" talks during section. When someone else is talking though, try to pay attention, because even if you didn’t do the readings, he or she might have.
Intellectual
Their version: Try doing something creative for five minutes everyday. Draw a quick picture with colored pencils just for fun or write a short poem. Even the smallest burst of creativity may inspire you.
Useful version: Comp the Crimson!
