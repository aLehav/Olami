After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the summer after fifth grade, I spent many afternoons lying on my parents’ big, cozy bed reading Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s “The Little Prince” cover to cover. Even for a kid that age it was a tiny book, so it was always possible to complete the little prince’s journey before dinner. By the end of August, I was no longer just reading. Whenever I turned to a new page, just by glancing at a few words and the occasional sketches by Saint-Exupery himself, I would remember what was going to happen: the little prince’s love for his rose; his travels to different planets and encounters with the troubled grown-ups living there; and his friendship with the narrator, a pilot in the desert...
I had read “The Little Prince” before, but it was not until that summer that I started to understand the fairy tale as also a love story. Later, when I had become much busier and picked up the book again on a whim, I realized that what had always attracted me was the book’s poetic nostalgia and romantic melancholy. Without me being aware of the process, the time I spent with it defined my aesthetic and even my personality.
In the end, “The Little Prince” is a story about a suicide. What else is it that the little prince does in the desert, if not self-sacrifice? He dies for a rose, a fragile sentimental flower on his tiny planet that he fell in love with as a child. Both of them were too shy and too naïve at the time, and now that he has finally learned to love, his flower is far away on another planet. He killed himself so that the time he spent with her would become eternity and [hiis][SP] love would remain pure.
By the time the little prince dies, the world has become different from what he used to know. Since he left his planet, he has met businessmen, salesclerks, and other grown-ups that he cannot understand. When he comes to the earth, he finds himself in a garden with hundreds of roses, all as gorgeous as the one he knows. If he had stayed longer, maybe someone would have offered him the conventional wisdom that it is stupid to spend so much time and effort on just one flower; were he to become as rich and successful as the businessmen, he could easily get them all. Maybe at that point he would agree with that someone and feel embarrassed for having genuinely believed in love.
The contrast between the little prince and the grown-ups can be easily compared to what many of us experience in real life, from outgrowing innocuous childhood friendships to studying something we don’t like and dying to get an offer from Goldman Sachs. A film adaptation from last year depicts this contrast as a god-awful Disney-esque dichotomy between adorable children and boring adults. The real, profound dilemma at the heart of the comparison, however, is that the businessmen and the garden roses are the people who really belong to this world. The little prince is too sensitive and too romantic. He has no place in this Darwinian society of competition, advertisements, capitalism, and survival of the fittest. This is why he must die.
From then on, I have been obsessed with the artistic themes of the us-against-the-world love affair, of people incompatible with society, and of suicide. I have found these ideas in David Bowie’s and John Lennon’s music, in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Pierrot Le Fou” and Ernest Hemingway’s “The Sun Also Rises.” But “The Little Prince” is different from all of these works. Saint-Exupery was an aviator first, then a writer. He loved the sky and the freedom it suggests. Despite living in a time of war, he believed in the beauty he saw from above the clouds and wanted to show it to the people on the ground. This [committment][SP] sets him apart from writers like Hemingway, who are so profoundly disappointed in the world that they no longer care.

The Harvard Krokodiloes sang and shared favorite snippets of memories with the audience during their 70th anniversary concert in Sanders Theatre on Friday. Hundreds of Kroks alumni of all ages came from around the country to celebrate with festive banquets, reunions with friends, and renditions of old standards during the weekend-long event.
Surveying the packed house, Peter S.S.Y. Wu ’16, the group’s general manager, and Tom M. Keefe ’16, gave virtually no introduction to their set. Instead, their fellow current Kroks sauntered and jumped from the theatre’s wings and aisles onto the stage, where they moved in time with the jazzy, snappy harmony of “House of Blue Lights,” a Kroks classic opening number. The singers ricocheted from stage right to stage left before settling into a loose arc. Scatting, smooth jazz, and some signature whoop-de-doops ensued, triggering smiles and cheers from the audience.
Twenty minutes before, Kroks alumni, friends, and family had filed into Sanders and mingled among the rows of red leather benches. In the audience, Mark H. Rubenstein ’90 and his Kroks peers launched into tales about their time in the group in the early 1990s, reminiscing about their annual trips to Bermuda and their undergraduate-years tuxedos, which they affectionately dubbed “battle tuxes” because they sang and danced in them until the suits burst at their seams. “I think they brought their original battle tuxes [this weekend],” Rubenstein said, pointing assuredly to John D. Zedd ’90 and Jonathan H. Ebel ’92, sitting to his left. “I have a new one,” he added, as the lights dimmed and the show began.
After the Kroks of 2016 finished their first set—a scatty version of “Take the A-Train” and a rendition of “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” that featured high-powered snapping—the Kroks of the 1960s took to the stage. During “Stormy Weather” and “The Emblem,” standards from The Krok Songbook, the soloists, salt-and-pepper haired and often bespectacled, strutted to the mic, having ditched their tuxes, “battle” or otherwise, for suits and ties. When they took their bows at the end of the set, Sanders gave them a standing ovation.
Moving through the decades of the group, the Kroks of the 1970s put a political spin on “Let’s Do It,” by doctoring the traditional lyrics to sound like insults traded during recent presidential candidate debates. “This next song is about sex,” a 1970s Krok said to introduce the number. The musical jabs included, “Ben Carson might snooze through it,” “Bill and Hillary may not do it,” “And Donald Trump, he invented it—just ask him, they’re huge,” and “Bernie Sanders, we assume does it.”
When all the groups—current, alumni, and honorary Kroks—took to the stage for the traditional Scottish song “Loch Lomond,” their voices coalesced into one powerful strand. “It’s just heartwarming because all the groups come together,” Michael J. Sun ’97 said during intermission, with a smile on his face.
The current Kroks felt it too. “It was amazing,” Michael A. Wingate ’18 said, reflecting on the performance after the concert. “This whole weekend was spectacular. This one crazy thing we all have in common that all really comes together in ‘Loch Lomond.’” Keefe agreed, saying, “It transcends words.”

Last week’s Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay, "The Big Short," tells the story of how a motley group of investors saw the 2008 financial crisis coming when no one else did. The film’s heroes are bankers with consciences, plucky little guys standing up to the titans of Wall Street. (Two of the characters run their hedge fund out of a garage). They see the contradictions of the housing market—the ghost towns of foreclosed condos, mortgage lenders preying on anyone with a pulse—and, disgusted, place bets against it. When the deluge comes, they profit handsomely. The underlying message is classic Hollywood: Doing the right thing pays off. The big banks, The Big Short contends, were too blinded by their greed to see the crisis coming. Avarice is its own undoing.
But that’s not quite accurate. Betting against the housing market was a financial call, not an ethical stance. By and large, the investors who profited from the financial crisis saw it coming because they understood the economics, not because they were morally any better or worse than their competitors. The film omits John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made $4 billion betting against the housing market. (Incidentally, some of that money now funds Harvard’s new Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.) It glosses over the fact that Goldman Sachs—one of the chief targets of the film—predicted the housing bubble as early as 2005, and also shorted mortgage-backed securities.
Turning the story of the few who profited from the financial crisis into a moral parable is giving the tale a dimension it did not have. To borrow a phrase from the economist Paul Krugman, economics is not a morality play. This dictum is not limited to the financial crisis; in general, trying to glean moral lessons from economic ones is misguided.
Krugman originally coined the phrase during the debate over fiscal austerity in 2010. In Europe (and to a lesser extent, the United States), commentators were calling for a return to common-sense fiscal discipline: Stimulus packages should be rolled back and deficits should be cut, lest debt pile up and become unmanageable. On the face of it, this seems ethically sound; countries, just like people, should live within their means. Moreover, these critics argued, countries that prudently built up surpluses for a rainy day, like Germany and the Netherlands, should not be held responsible for supporting profligates like Greece or Spain.
But applying this “common sense” logic to economic management proved disastrous. In depressed economies like Greece, government spending has an amplified effect (in economic jargon, this is to say that the fiscal multiplier is high). Small cuts to spending become disproportionately painful, while increases to spending, even minor ones, can ease a significant amount of pain. There is even significant evidence that by causing so much economic damage, policies of fiscal austerity actually made the debt situation worse for some of these Eurozone countries. In this topsy-turvy economic world, thriftiness was a vice and profligacy a virtue; the normal moral intuitions about paying back your debts did not apply.
Here’s another brief example: Do greater levels of democracy promote economic growth? An influential 1994 paper by economist Robert Barro found that greater levels of political freedom were associated with faster rates of growth—but only to a point. Past a certain threshold of moderate political freedom, Barro found a negative relationship between growth and democracy; in other words, there was a trade-off between levels of political freedom and economic prosperity. Is the takeaway here that we should give up some of our rights in order to achieve a higher growth rate for GDP?
Of course such a trade-off would be absurd. Economic questions and moral concerns do not neatly align; they are orthogonal to each other. In the debate over fiscal austerity, prudence and prodigality were even reversed. As comforting as the David-and-Goliath story of "The Big Short" is, it is ultimately a fable. The traders at Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, who survived the crash, enjoyed no moral high ground over the employees at Lehman Brothers or Bear Sterns, who didn’t.
Telling the story of investors who acted ethically during the crisis but did not make money would make for a braver and perhaps more interesting picture. Pity that that sort of movie would not sell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, the eight head football coaches of the Ivy League voted unanimously to ban full-contact hitting from all regular season practices. Though the decision has not yet been fully finalized—it must still be approved by the schools’ athletic directors and presidents, as well as by the League’s policy committee—the coaches’ decision should be heralded as a move in the right direction for the future of the sport and the safety of its participants.
With its frequent head-to-head collisions, football is especially susceptible to the problem of concussions, an issue which has come to the forefront of public consciousness in recent years. There is a growing body of research about the effects of brain trauma and conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, as well as an ever-increasing list of lawsuits by former players against the National Football League. Football at lower levels—in college, in high school, in Pop Warner, and in Pee Wee—suffers from the same health hazards.
Unsurprisingly, evidence from high school leagues and the NFL has shown that reducing the number of hits players experience can help lower concussion rates. It thus makes sense to limit the contact that occurs during the season. In light of this, we applaud Harvard and the other Ivy League schools for moving to protect their student-athletes. The fact that some schools have already moved in this direction, with the banning of full-contact hitting year-round at Dartmouth since 2010 and in-season at Harvard for 15 years, reflects well on our conference.
Though the Ivy League is not considered a leader in the world of collegiate football, the Ancient Eight nevertheless hold a hallowed place in the early development of the sport and play a leadership role in the sphere of higher education. We hope that the coaches’ decision—and the already stringent practice restrictions of the Ivy League—can act as a model for other football conferences across the country at the collegiate level and below. Even if schools are hesitant to ban full-contact practices for fear of reducing their players’ tackling ability, we hope that they consider holding helmetless practices to mitigate the dangers of concussion-inducing hits and encourage the development of safer tackling technique.
A final reason to support these efforts is that the problem of head injuries in football may disproportionately affect athletes least able to handle the financial consequences. At Harvard, most football players receive financial aid, and suffering from severe head trauma is likely to be particularly economically burdensome for those students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a long time, I didn’t understand the whole Asian male emasculation thing, because to me, yellow boys were as boyish as boys could get, and they were masculine not because they were tall (some are) or sporty (ditto) or charismatic (you guessed it), but because I wanted them. And I grew up with them. And I liked them and hated them and learned the big life revelations about them—boys are immature/need to grow up—just as well as anybody in paper-white Ohio or Kendrick’s Compton did. But that is real life, and society is a theoretical one.
Yellow men have historically been emasculated in the United States; here is a story. Ko Shigeta is 17 years old and arrives to work on a Hawaiian sugar plantation in 1903. Years later, he remembers this: bathing in the same place as other yellow men’s wives and feeling them step over him “as if [he] were a dog or cat in their path.” He remembers their indifference to his nakedness. This story describes a difficult emasculation, one created but not directly imposed by a white presence. It feels tragic because it speaks of helplessness. It is one thing to be hurt by someone who is supposed to hurt you. After a while, you build resistance to that kind of hurt. You find yourself. You learn to shrug.
But Shigeta’s story talks about a completely different kind of hurt: the hurt that comes from being ignored by the people who are supposed to notice you, if not love you. Yes, when you are a yellow male and “the people” you are referencing are yellow females, this sentiment may be a problematic seed of male entitlement. But that does not mean that it slips through fingers.  This is the type of historicized emasculation The Yellow American Man comes from.
One product of this emasculation, Eddie Huang, is a “Big Dick Asian,” meaning he’s gone to jail; he calls himself Rich Homie Huang; the menu at his restaurant, Xiao Ye, features “Flat Taiwanese Bootycake;” he complains, “Asian people never get any pussy in movies;" and his response to feminists calling him out on misogyny is, “are we dating cause you wildin.” Maybe even more disturbing than Huang’s movement is the fact that it provokes almost no negative responses. Even if Huang is one of the most visible yellow people in America, no one believes that the militant language he uses poses a real threat to society.
There is no room in the racial equality movement for misogyny. But truthfully, saying that statement over and over again isn’t helpful. I don’t believe it is enough to call Huang out because his sexism runs too deeply. How does a boy become a man? Generally, by leaving his mother. Historically, he kills an animal. Traditionally, he has consensual or nonconsensual sex with a virgin. In every model of man-ing, the way a boy becomes a man is by hurting something, and usually, a female. This is why sexism is not just one aspect but rather the entirety of Eddie Huang’s racial identity. It is unfair to claim Huang chooses the “wrong way” to man himself when there are no other ways to do it right.
The dilemma of being both raced and gendered as a yellow American female does not lie in being called “eggroll” on the street. Instead, it lies here: Strengthening your race can mean weakening your sex. Which leads to other questions, questions we must answer not as yellow before female, or female before yellow, but yellow and female together, unapologetically. What does it mean for a race if its two genders do not and cannot get along? How can you love yourself when you are told to be disgusted by those who look like you? How can you, as a yellow American female, be viewed as strong when your male counterpart is viewed as weak?
This is not, of course, the first time people have remedied emasculation with hypermasculinity. Historically, black American males have done the same. But there are fundamental differences between yellow American and black American experiences that make yellow American feminism unique and not just a less developed version of the black American one. First, there is not and has never been a strong solidarity between yellow males and females. Instead, we repel each other. In Jenny An’s case, we quote Junot Diaz, New York Magazine, and the “bastions of liberal thought” to rationalize it. We know white supremacy when we see it. We know what Kool-Aid we’re drinking. But ironically, some of us will still claim that yellow men are patriarchal symbols, and white men are our saviors. Some of us will still hate ourselves enough to equate our skin inextricably with Ivy League mania, servility, filial piety, and hard working humility.
Second, while black people have identified with blackness, yellow people have not defined yellowness, in my experience. Dumplings, pandas, Amy Tan, JustKiddingNews, Dumbfoundead, and everybody’s Tiger Mom is not yellowness. Yellowness should be deep and vital and beautiful and complicated in order to be of use to its deep and vital and beautiful and complicated people. While black women are often resistant to identifying with white feminist agendas and concerns, yellow women are less resistant. Black women have argued for feminist theories that incorporate discussions about black lives, bringing items such as hip-hop and pleasure politics to the conversation. Yellow women do not. And it’s not because yellow women face the same issues as white women. That is untrue. Rather, I think it’s because we, yellow people, are more willing and able to separate our identities from our color.
I know that understanding your identity through your color is not inherently good. But it does give you a context, make you more aware of your personhood, which serves a purpose for some. And if you are both gendered and raced, the two work together to fumble up power structures, rendering strictly gendered conversations inadequate. This is true even if you are yellow. You don’t have to say anything. But still, if you choose to talk, talk right.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
I hope the Harvard Corporation will take a deep breath before it deliberates on the recommendation to change the HLS shield because of its connection to the Royall family and slavery.  I hope the Corporation remains true to Harvard’s commitment to honesty and wisdom—veritas indeed.  The urge to airbrush uncomfortable facts from history is dangerous.  Yale might have a real problem with the naming of Calhoun College, but the Royall family contribution looks quite different.
Getting rid of the Royall family crest seems too much like wanting to hide from our connection with slavery.  Today’s debate about and greater awareness of Harvard’s connection to slavery is all very beneficial, but, ironically, it would not even be happening if the Royall family emblem had not been chosen for the HLS shield in 1936.  No, better to have it out in the open to remind us all on a daily basis.  If we really must repudiate what Royall did, then we should find a descendant of the Royall family and give them back their tainted money, with interest, and insist that they set up a foundation for social and economic justice.
But, really, what is the Royall family legacy?  Today, we interpret it very differently.  Of course part of it is the evil, the crime of slavery—that Royall stole the lives of his slaves and stole the wealth of their labors.  But the past is past.  Is it not realistic to say that the law school is not Royall’s legacy, but is rather the slaves’ legacy, thanks to the wealth they created?  What better way to be reminded of this, and to acknowledge the conundrum of history, than to look at the HLS shield and always know that it was really the slaves who made the gift, not Royall.  If we could go back in time, it is they we would thank.
Further, what makes the shield an especially appropriate reminder is that the Royall crest displays three sheaves of harvested grain.  Well.  We know who toiled in the fields, and who did the planting, and who did the cultivating, and who did the harvesting, and who bound those sheaves.  Truly, that emblem doesn’t even belong to the Royall family, it represents the slaves.
If 18th century slaveholders saw the world today, many would say it has been turned on its head.  So, perhaps a solution is to keep the Royall elements in the HLS shield, but to turn the three sheaves upside down, as if they were drying.  This way we make a statement today about Royall’s slavery, and at the same time we have a constant reminder that Harvard must thank the slaves for the bounty created by their labors.  If we cannot see our way clear to think this way, then we are hypocrites until we give the money back.

Five finalists and the winner of the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Journalism discussed their projects and perspectives in front of a crowded room at the Kennedy School this past Friday.
The Goldsmith Seminar on Investigative Reporting, hosted by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, recognizes stories that have the potential to impact public policy, ranging from issues of police shootings to the use of slave labor in the seafood industry.
The event emphasized the importance of investigative journalism that exposes illegal activities as well as unethical practices.
Robin McDowell, an Associated Press reporter whose story on the widespread use of slaves in Thailand’s seafood industry won the Goldsmith Award, highlighted investigative journalism’s ability to create positive change.
“This is such a common story. Everyone in Southeast Asia knows about [the slavery]. Why is there no outrage?” McDowell said on the panel. “If we didn’t try and make the rest of the world care, then we weren’t doing our jobs.”
Some panelists hoped their stories would strengthen social justice and accountability.
Kimberly Kindy, a Washington Post reporter who conducted an analysis on all fatal shootings by on-duty officers in the United States in 2015, said she hoped her work would provide fodder for future journalists.
McDowell also stressed the need for continued reporting to ensure efforts for change continue.
“One of the problems of this issue, or human trafficking in general, is when you put a spotlight on some things, it’s like shining a flashlight on cockroaches: they all scurry away and then, as soon as the light’s off, they scurry back. Journalists, NGOs, government, consumers have to keep pushing,” she said.
Audience members also expressed their enthusiasm for the quality of this year’s stories nominated for the award.
“I think this type of journalism is a massive tribute to bringing up stories and bringing up issues and giving light and maybe in a more human fashion, as well,” Timothy J. Chambers, a School of Public Health student, said.
Shorenstein Center interim Director and panel moderator Thomas E. Patterson highlighted the importance of continuing to recognize news outlets for their investigative reporting.
“For news organizations, these awards mean a lot. They in a sense are the stamp of approval on the work that they’re doing, and in many ways this is a stamp that this is high quality work and they bring credit to the organization,” he said after the event.

Since the College has no Latino Studies concentration, Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17 said she decided to pursue a concentration in Sociology as a way of getting at her interests in Latin America. However, she said she has since been disappointed by the Sociology Department's lack of course offerings in Latin America.

Vasquez-Rodriguez said she has also found a lack of diverse and non-Western perspectives in the mainstay of many social science concentrations in the College: the required tutorials. She said she even approached a teaching fellow about a lack of writers of color on the syllabus.
Vasquez-Rodriguez's frustration with a Western-dominated curriculum in one of the social sciences leaves her in good company. As students and professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences increasingly call for courses that move beyond American and Western European foci and schools of thought, the slow pace of curricular change has left many dissatisfied. However, access to non-Western perspectives and methods continues to grow.
GLARING GAPS
Students searching for a non-Western take on the social sciences will first run up against a critical obstacle: there aren't many of those courses.
The availability of course offerings largely depend on the specialization of faculty in that department. According to History Department Chair David R. Armitage, his department recently went through a period of five or six years without any professors of Latin American history after the loss of several faculty members. Since then, the department has rebuilt its Latin American subset with the addition of one junior and three senior faculty members.
“We couldn’t claim to be a serious department without large scale coverage of Latin American history, both in time and in space,” Armitage said.
However, gaps in the department’s coverage still remain, he said, most notably in Middle Eastern history. The retirement of the department’s sole specialist caused the shortage. While Armitage said filling the gap is a priority, it is partly out of his control. Last year, FAS administrators allotted for no new hires in the History Department despite his requests, he said.
Government is another concentration that has recently suffered from a lack of Middle Eastern coverage. Government professor Melani C. Cammett, who began teaching at Harvard this year, said she is the first full Government professor with expertise in the Middle East that FAS has had in decades. As the sole specialist in the region in her department, she has a lot of ground to cover.

“People who work on India or China probably only work on India and China, and that’s more acceptable in American social science to only work on one of these big countries, whereas I have to be an expert in 23 countries because I work on this homogenous unit called ‘the Middle East,’ which isn’t homogenous at all,” Cammett said.
While Government concentrators interested in the United States can always count on faculty creating courses in their area of focus, others are not so lucky. Government concentrator Delany D. Sisiruca ’16 is doing thesis work that focuses on Latin America, which she said has been a challenge because the department’s only two Latin American specialists are currently on academic leave.
Like the History Department’s current lack of a scholar of the Middle East, Rodriguez sees the problem as one that can be remedied by hiring practices, not just of more faculty who focus on non-Western areas, but of more faculty of color as well.
LIMITED LENSES
Ted G. Waechter ’18 remembers sitting in Social Studies 10a, a required class for all Social Studies concentrators, and listening to his professor tell a joke about the Republican presidential primary candidates.
“I remember thinking, ‘In those three minutes, we spent more time thinking about the 2016 Republican presidential primary candidates than everyone in Sub-Saharan Africa,’” Waechter, a Crimson Editorial writer, said.
That moment hit home what Waechter had already started to realize: the Social Studies concentration was just not for him. He now concentrates in African and African-American Studies.
Waechter's experience encapsulates something other students have expressed—even in the most important courses within some social science concentrations, students say they are exposed primarily to Western perspectives and methodologies.
However, Waechter said the Social Studies concentration is working towards making the concentration less focused on men and white people. According to American History professor James Kloppenberg, who began co-teaching Social Studies 10 this fall, the course syllabus includes African American and women writers for the first time since the course was created in the 1960s.
Still, the emphasis of the course is primarily Western, Kloppenberg said.
“It’s a course that’s designed to introduce students to the social sciences, and the social sciences in universities in the Western world have been shaped by Western thinkers,” he said.
Brandon M. Terry, a professor of Social Studies and African and African-American Studies, co-teaches with Kloppenberg. He said he is in the process of developing Social Studies tutorials that will focus specifically on African American political thought and key moments in African American politics.
Western dominance can appear not only in the names of writers on a syllabus, but in the methodology of a course as well. Sisiruca said this was most apparent in her sophomore Government tutorial.
“There’s a huge Western perspective on things, and I remember noticing it most in our sophomore tutorial, which is entirely sort of this Western conception of democracy and it’s very normative,” she said. “It’s sort of like ‘why don’t all of these governments have our concept of democracy yet?’”
East Asian History professor Michael Szonyi said this Western-centric lens is prevalent in his field as well.
“Most scholars at Harvard would disagree with the premise that we study China using Western methods,” Szonyi said. “Most scholars would say that these are universal methods, that happened to be developed in the West, but that social science is not particular to any one culture, but it’s worth asking the question if that’s true.”
Szonyi said he himself subscribes to the South China School of history, which was developed by Chinese intellectuals. He said he believes that he was hired partly to provide this different perspective and that he is currently the only practitioner of this school of thought at Harvard.
THE CASE FOR DIVERSITY
Access to non-Western perspectives allows Harvard to meet students’ interests when they arrive on campus and to expose them to a broad range of experiences they might encounter after graduating.
Terry said his decisions about Social Studies 10 were influenced by what he saw students were interested in.
“For me, it was really important to kind of look at what are people writing theses about, what kind of questions are they trying to answer,” Terry said. “And to me, that’s why it was so important to really make sure people got a theoretical introduction to theory on issues of race, gender, post-colonialism, sexuality, because the students are writing about that.”
As for the History Department, Armitage said there is a balance of students doing thesis work in American history, European history, and history outside of Europe.
History professor Kirsten A. Weld was the first of the hires to repopulate the History Department with Latin Americanists.
“It means that the number of undergrad courses we’ve been able to offer has increased significantly,” she said. “It means that the number of potential thesis advisers has expanded a lot, so it has created a lot of new opportunities for students at the College to study Latin American and Caribbean history.”
But the case for non-Western curricula goes beyond diversifying senior theses. From a practical standpoint, Harvard students must be exposed to wider perspectives to thrive in the modern world, faculty members said.
Szonyi said, when he began at Harvard, most of the focus on China was found in the East Asian Studies Department and at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, which he now directs. Now, however, the study of China has spread throughout Harvard, and more students are coming to the Fairbank Center to ask for funding to study in China, reflecting the country’s growing prominence.
There is also the question of what students should gain from a liberal arts education. For many faculty members, exposure to different cultures and perspectives is part of the answer.
“I think it’s just really valuable to study a culture that is radically different from one’s own to the extent that it might question our assumptions on our own society,” Sunil Amrith, a professor of History and South Asian Studies, said.
RECENT STRIDES
Amrith’s appointment, as the first tenure-track professor hired in the new South Asian Studies Department, is part of a larger trend faculty members said they have noticed in FAS to hire peers with a non-Western focus.
“There is certainly room in the overall Harvard curriculum for a broadening of the kinds of things people read, and I think the appointments that have been made in recent years indicate that most departments in Harvard are quite alert to that,” Kloppenberg said.
Recently appointed FAS Dean of Social Science Claudine Gay, a professor of Government and African and African-American Studies, said she counts diversity among one of her core values.
“I feel like we really cheat ourselves an an institution if we don’t reflect the diversity of experiences and talents that are out there,” Gay said.
Where course offerings are still lacking, students and professors sometimes turn to resources outside of the classroom. Recently, working groups were formed in both Latino Studies and Asian American Studies, through the committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights.
Students also have access to the  international centers in FAS that fall under the purview of the Social Sciences division.
“I think of one of the things that the international centers... do is to try and break out of an ethnocentric focus and place Harvard better in the world and the kind of education we give more substantially in the context of the world,” Asia Center Director and Anthropology professor Arthur Kleinman said.
For David J. Coletti ’17, it is not enough to just provide students who seek out non-Western coursework or scholarship with those opportunities.
“One can easily graduate Harvard without taking a course on any other country besides a European country or the United States, and I see an issue in that,” Coletti said.
Coletti said he initially concentrated in Government but switched to the Latin America track of History and Literature, which he said has provided him with a greater opportunity to read primary texts about the region he studies.
Waechter, too, said he has found a concentration that better suits his scholarly interests in the African and African-American Studies Department. However, the issue is greater than one student’s intellectual interests, or even the social sciences at Harvard.
Anthropology concentrator Hanaa Masalmeh ’18 said personal identity is affected when a cultural heritage dominates an academic field.
“The reason that a lot of this non-Western heritage isn’t taught in schools is because it’s seen as unimportant, whether implicitly or explicitly,” Masallah said. “And so that eventually leads to dehumanizing, which eventually leads to this kind of chasm between people who have their history in the mainstream and who have their history as an elective class.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Semitic Museum is focusing its fundraising efforts on incorporating new technology into its exhibits to engage students in hands-on learning, as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ portion of Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign.
Between $10 and $50 million would be needed to renovate the museum building and gallery spaces, increase digitization efforts, and pursue international collaborations among other initiatives, according to Semitic Museum Director and Egyptology professor Peter Der Manuelian ’81.
“My goal is to revitalize the place further,” Der Manuelian said. “So I want to make this an exciting destination on campus. I’d love it if every undergraduate would set foot in the building at least once, and preferably more than once before they graduate.”
The Semitic Museum’s fundraising takes place under the “Leading in Learning” category of the FAS campaign, which was well below its goal as of October.
“The teaching and learning aspect of what we do and what the individual museums do, that’s one of the campaign buckets,” Jane Pickering, the executive director of the six Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, said. The Semitic Museum is one of the six museums.
Pickering also said financial support for the museums has come in many forms, including revenues from memberships, donors, federal funding, and various foundations.
Making museum exhibits into better resources for learning was a priority, Der Manuelian said.
“My goal then is to rethink the galleries on our three floors, and bring in new educational technologies as well. So we want to use the collection as display, as teaching tools, merge the old with the new,” Der Manuelian said.
Jiayi Peng ’17 said she enjoys walking through the museum on her way to Societies of the World 46: “Anthropology of Arabia,” which is held in the Semitic Museum.
“I like how diverse both the medium of information and the content of the information is,” Peng said, “but honestly, we have not yet used any of the collections.”
As one of its technology ventures, the Semitic Museum is partnering with Google to create a virtual tour of the galleries in hopes of raising interest and bringing more visitors to the physical spaces.
Der Manuelian said he also fundraises for his work on the Giza Project, which he said overlaps with the Semitic Museum’s interests, citing the creation of the throne of Egyptian Queen Hetepheres using 3D digital models, computer technology, and human labor. The recreated throne is now on display in the museum.
Modernizing building amenities remains a priority as well, according to Der Manuelian. In 2013, the museum obtained its first elevator, increasing its accessibility.
“That set us on the path to really better viability,” he said.
Pickering emphasized the role of the museums in the University’s educational program, citing a figure from the College’s annual senior survey that 89 percent of students reported using the museum collections at least once during their four years.
“It’s not only really special, but it’s unique to Harvard,” Pickering said of the more than 28 million objects in the FAS collections.

Sweetgreen, an east coast-based salad chain, plans to open a new location this summer in Harvard Square.
The company, which specializes in salads based on local and organic ingredients, was founded in 2007 and boasts locations throughout the east coast and California, including three in the Boston area. This will be the company’s first Cambridge restaurant.
Sweetgreen Spokesperson Amy Clark wrote in an email that the company is still planning the new eatery in preparation for an opening towards the end of the summer.
Sweetgreen will occupy the building at 39 JFK St., which formerly housed an American Express, and was recently bought by Hong Kong billionaire and Harvard donor Gerald Chan.
Sweetgreen’s permit application was unanimously approved the Harvard Square Advisory Committee, which reviews applications for permits within Harvard Square, on Feb. 22. In the application, the restaurant was listed as having seating for 36 customers at a size of around 4,000 square feet.
Many Harvard Square restaurant staples have closed over the past year, including Yogurtland, Panera Bread, and Yenching, and students said they were excited to hear about Sweetgreen’s planned opening.
Jenny Li ’19 said Sweetgreen is quite popular in Washington D.C., where she and Sweetgreen are both originally from. She said she’s a fan of Sweetgreen because of the chain’s commitment to sustainability and “yummy” salads.
“Before I got on campus, I actually looked up where the closest Sweetgreen from Harvard was, so I could satisfy my craving here in college,” Li said.
Upon arriving in Cambridge, Li was disappointed to find out the nearest Sweetgreen was more than two miles away.
Erin E. Masatsugu ’17 said she was “stoked” to hear about Sweetgreen’s plans to come to Cambridge, and said she felt a salad chain is a much needed option in the Square.
“I love Sweetgreen and it'll be nice to have a place to get good, fast salads, and bowls, and fresh produce and stuff which I think a lot of students are into but the Square lacks currently,” Masatsugu said.
Other students echoed Masatsugu, and credited Sweetgreen for an astute business move.
“There's really no other restaurants dedicated to salad,”  said Lola G.  Agabalogun  ’17. “I think Harvard Square is the perfect market for Sweetgreen to enter.”

Roughly 300 scholars, professionals, and students from both Harvard and around the world attended the third annual LGBTQ Conference at Harvard, hosted at Harvard Law School on Saturday.
Established in 2014, the conference directed attention to topics of non-binary identity and intersectionality—the overlap of social categories such as race, class, gender, and sexuality.
This year’s conference included panels of activists and students who discussed a variety of issues ranging from criminal justice policy to safe spaces. Keynote speakers included activist and educator Robyn Ochs, Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, who was the first transgender White House appointee in the Obama Administration, and Executive Director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders Janson Wu.

Conference coordinators focused on seeking a breadth of input through collaboration amongst representatives from each of the Harvard graduate schools when planning the conference’s topics and panels.
Members of the Harvard graduate student body were directly surveyed at the beginning of the academic year, allowing students to suggest conference topics through voting and free response, according to Kennedy School student Ted J. Sands.
“It let us embrace the specificity that sometimes comes with some of these intersectional conversations,” Sands said. “Having a smaller group of people at some of these events just meant that the people that were there were really engaged.”
One topic that has garnered attention at the conference was the ongoing debate regarding safe spaces on college campuses. A panel of Kennedy School and Law School affiliates hosted a conversation called “Safe Spaces: Continuing an Increasingly Important Conversation within LGBTQ Communities in Schools.”
Natara Gray, coordinator at the Office for Student Diversity and Inclusion at the Kennedy School, said achieving safe spaces stems from both an active investment in improving the classroom environment on the part of administrators, and a dialogue between administrators and students.
“They need to hone in on the student voices,” Gray said. “The key point for me is having the conversations with students and understanding what it is they need to thrive and to survive.”
The conference also paid significant attention to the role of religion for queer individuals, addressing what some characterized as an unexpected propensity among queer individuals to pursue religion and spirituality in their daily lives.
The LGBTQ Conference organized a new initiative this year that highlighted religion and BGLTQ identities.
The conference’s comparative religions panel the next day, titled “Sacred Struggles: Faith, Politics, and the Future of LGBTQ Equality,” engaged individuals from a variety of religious and professional backgrounds to discuss their experiences with the intersection of religion, identity, and politics.
Rabbi D’vorah Rose emphasized the need to recognize political motivations in conversations of religion, identity, and policy. She used the recent bills about gender-neutral bathrooms in state legislatures as as an example of how political agendas and religion influence the daily reality of BGLTQ people.
“We need a separation of religion as politics, and religion as what we’re all living and breathing and engaging in our daily lives,” she said.
Shane K. Hebel, a Law School student and a coordinator of the conference, emphasized his personal desire to have attendees continue to have conversations after the conclusion of the conference.
“One thing that I really liked about this year is that people seem to be extremely engaged,” Hebel said. “When people would come out into the hallways, everyone was talking on what they heard and kind of reflecting on it, and I thought that was awesome.”

Administrators at the College, Harvard University Health Services, and Cambridge Public Health Department are working to contain the spread of mumps and care for students who have been affected by the virus by relocating them to isolated housing for an extended period of time.
“We have officially an outbreak of mumps in this population,” HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira said. “It’s happening with students who are well-immunized, so it’s a breakthrough infection. So the task is to get the population to act in ways that minimizes the spread of the virus.”
The number of confirmed cases at the University has not increased since Barreira’s email last Wednesday, which stated that six students on campus had contracted the virus. Since that time, Barreira has circulated information about preventing the spread of the virus, and encouraged students exhibiting symptoms of mumps to contact HUHS.
“We have no way of knowing how it came on campus,” Barreira said. “Public Health is responsible with interviewing everybody, and then they try to do a contact mapping to see if they can identify how it came to campus, but at this point they’re not optimistic they will find what’s called the index case.”
Barreira said preventive measures against mumps include practicing hygienic habits like hand washing and refraining from sharing eating utensils, seeing a doctor at the onset of mumps-like symptoms, and isolating suspected cases early.
“We examine and identify clinically people who are at risk, do a buccal swab to check for virus, then we communicate to the College,” Barreira said. “Then the College notifies the House and then identifies the room that they’re going to move into.”
The Cambridge Public Health Department mandates that students infected with mumps be quarantined in a single room with an individual bathroom for five days. Since most dorm rooms share a bathroom, students are housed elsewhere on campus, according to Barreira.
In an emailed statement, College Spokesperson Rachael Dane said the College is “utilizing various locations on campus for students who need to self-isolate, including rooms in some of the Houses and Harvard-owned properties.”
“We are also taking special precautions with regards to cleaning these spaces, with Facilities Maintenance Operations custodians undergoing special training cleaning the rooms and disposing of waste,” Dane wrote.
Ninety-nine percent of undergraduates have been vaccinated against mumps, according to Barreira. Barreira added that although some other universities verify mumps immunizations through a questionnaire, Harvard requires documentation of the vaccine.
“In this state, we require two shots, one month apart,” Barreira said. “We often test to see if there’s adequate antibodies too. In some states around the country, they only require one shot, which by [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] standards is considered under-immunization.”
Though some Harvard affiliates have asked whether a third booster shot for all students would help prevent the spread of the virus, Barreira said there is no evidence that a third booster shot would provide more immunity.
“The CDC is very clear in their recommendations that a third shot doesn’t provide more immunity,” Barreira said. “So if you’ve been well vaccinated, there’s no indication that a third shot will give you any more protection.”
As undergraduates prepare for spring break, University administrators will send “a message encouraging responsible behavior when traveling with respect to careful hygiene and not using public transportation if ill,” Barreira wrote in an email.
In the meantime, administrators are informing parents of students about the recent mumps outbreak. On Wednesday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent an email to Harvard parents looping them into Barreira’s latest email about the virus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of nearly 500 alumni is mounting a campaign against an outsider ticket for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, denouncing its proposals to eliminate tuition and scrutinize affirmative action as antithetical to diversity.
The group, called “Coalition for a Diverse Harvard,” launched a website last Wednesday inviting students and alumni to voice their opposition to the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ticket running for the University’s second highest governing body. The ticket, organized by Ron K. Unz ’83 and headlined by five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, has drawn national media attention and criticism from Harvard’s top administrators for its two-pronged platform.
Jeannie Park ’83, a founder of the Coalition, said she learned of the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” campaign while its candidates were soliciting Asian American alumni groups for support in order to qualify for the Overseers ballot. Upon learning that most of the candidates had publicly argued against affirmative action, Park said she and her friends decided they “needed to do something to call attention to the larger agenda of the candidates, and, frankly, to stop them.”
“We were particularly disturbed by the idea that the slate was counting on Asian American alumni to give them the votes they needed,” Park said. "There is a long history of using Asian Americans to drive a wedge into affirmative action. We reject being part of any such strategy at Harvard.”
The outsider ticket, which also counts physicist Stephen D. Hsu, writer Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., and attorney Lee C. Cheng ’93 among its members, is calling for Harvard to release more detailed data about its undergraduate admissions processes, suspecting that the College’s use of affirmative action could be used to discriminate against Asian American applicants.
“The fact that these particular individuals are happy with the current system and who gets admitted does not mitigate the fact that the admissions process is potentially very unfair,” Unz said, referring to the Coalition. “Harvard proudly proclaims that it takes race into consideration and believes in diversity but it denies that there's any sort of an Asian quota. Harvard should be honest in what it’s doing.”
Kevin B. Jennings ’85, president of the First Generation Harvard Alumni Board and a member of the Coalition, called the “Free Harvard” tenet of the candidates’ platform a “red herring,” contending that making Harvard free would would unnecessarily subsidize tuition for wealthier students.
“It's very easy to come up with phrases that are catchy and appealing, like ‘Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,’” he said. “This strikes me more as a PR stunt than a genuine effort to understand how we can make Harvard a fairer place for people of all backgrounds.”
Unz countered Jennings’s criticism, pointing to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders who is “advocating free tuition for everybody in America, including the grandchildren of Donald Trump.”
“Nobody's accusing him of being a tremendous supporter of the rich,” Unz said.
According to Park, the Coalition sent a questionnaire focused on issues of diversity to all 13 Overseers candidates—counting both the outsider quintet and the eight nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association—and plans to endorse five based on their responses and biographies by the end of March.

UPDATED: March 7, 2016, at 12:17 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council voted unanimously to grant $488 to fund and establish a partnership with Feedback Hotline, a new startup that seeks to establish a phone number students can text to provide feedback to the Council.
The grant to Feedback Hotline is the first usage of the UC’s new $30,000 Grant for an Open Harvard College, which allocates funds to students and student organizations who submit proposals for initiatives that address one or more of the Council’s four “compelling interests”: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces. 
Under the Feedback Hotline program, students can text a phone number that passes along their feedback to UC representatives, according to a proposal by organizers listed on the meeting agenda, Akshar Bonu ’17, Bo Seo ’17, and John Q. Stubbs ’17.
“It’s the easiest way to give feedback, given that we’ve all probably sent an iMessage or a text in the last hour,” Bonu said.
UC Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18 said Feedback Hotline will help improve the existing resources on campus and address the Council’s compelling interests by allowing students to provide criticism and suggestions to student leaders.
“There is a breakdown of communication on Harvard’s campus,” Feedback Hotline’s proposal states. Seo pointed towards undergraduates’ desire for anonymity and the current inconvenience of providing feedback to UC representatives as potential barriers to effective feedback.
“You want to have the legitimacy of people believing that they’re being heard,” Seo said while addressing the Council during Sunday’s general meeting.
According to Feedback Hotline’s current timeline, the hotline will be launched for UC representatives by the week of March 28. Feedback Hotline hopes to expand to allow students to provide feedback to leaders of other student organizations by April. The developers also have plans to allow students to use Feedback Hotline to connect with school administrators by next fall.
The UC’s Executive Committee considered five proposals for funding under the Open Harvard College Grant, and ultimately decided to fund only Feedback Hotline.
During the Council’s meeting, representatives also voted to pass legislation that calls for the “need for inclusivity and respect” of all students in response to concerns raised after many undergraduates criticized a broken gender-neutral bathroom sign in Eliot House last Wednesday.
“As Council members, we want to acknowledge the necessity of mandating gender-neutral restrooms in renovated houses,” the approved statement says.
Some Council members expressed disapproval of the legislation, suggesting that although its sentiments were well-intentioned, the Council’s response should focus on policy action rather than a letter of solidarity.
“Instead of responding with empty words that we’re going to post on social media, we should respond with directives,” Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 said.
Still, most representatives defended the letter. “They’re not empty words,” Nicholas Whittaker ’19 said. “They’re declarations of solidarity, and they really matter.”
During the meeting, the Council also announced the establishment of a Digital Commission, which will work on technical projects that can help address UC initiatives. Non-UC members may be invited to join the commission after a technical interview, according to a proposal distributed at the meeting.
As its first project, the commission will seek to automate the Finance Committee’s Completed Project Form, which student organizations must complete after receiving grants from the UC. Council representatives Neel Mehta ’18 and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 will manage the project.

Harvard affiliates and locals interested in Africa gathered to discuss the continent’s future at the 7th annual African Development Conference, hosted at Harvard Law School this weekend.
The conference included discussion groups, panels, and keynote speeches focusing on highlighting successful development initiatives and rethinking development beyond 2015, according to pamphlets distributed at the event.
Achille Mbembe, a history and politics professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and Anas Aremeyaw Anas, an undercover journalist working in Ghana and around the African continent, drew on their professional expertise in discussing challenges facing Africa during the opening keynote speeches.
Mbembe emphasized the role changing demographics in Africa will have on the international climate.
“The future of our planet is being played out in the continent. If we want to have an idea of where our world is going, what is coming, Africa is the laboratory where we can see this,” he said.
Mbembe also highlighted the importance of creating a form of African nationality, which he said will require a re-opening of Africa and the abolition of colonial boundaries.
Anas, who works with law enforcement to not only expose, but also prosecute criminals, defended his controversial journalistic practices as necessary in protecting the people of Ghana.
“I believe that extreme remedies are the most appropriate for extreme diseases, and I belong to the remedy,” Anas said, covering his face to maintain anonymity.
Panel sessions on Saturday explored education, governance, health, and personal narratives, among other topics.
Debisi Araba, a Kennedy School fellow and student organizer for the conference, underscored the drawing power Harvard has in holding such an event.
“We created our unique selling point of bringing in not necessarily consenting voices, but bringing in people who have different perspectives on what Africa’s future will look like, and should look like, and have them create an atmosphere for healthy debate amongst all our participants,” Araba said.
Yusuph O. Mkangara ’17, who helped organize the event, emphasized his own desire to see the conference be made more accessible, both financially and institutionally, especially to members of the African diaspora in the greater Boston area.
“There’s a great Cape Verdean community here in Boston, and I just didn’t see Cape Verdean representation. There are tons of African workers within the Harvard system, people with African roots, that could really benefit from this conference,” he said.
Lisasa A. Opuka, who has attended the conference three times, said the conference allows him to gain a better perspective on solutions to issues in Africa.
“I decided to come because Africans have been marginalized and one reason for the marginalization has to do with the fact that people from the diaspora, especially Africa, are not as well-informed as they should be,” Opuka said.
The organizers emphasized a hope for the conference to leave attendees better informed and inspired to be a part of Africa’s future.
“The hope is that ultimately, out of the space, people connect, network, and start thinking about what are some deliverableswhat are some actions we can take, starting Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, this summer, or next month,” Mkangara said.

Bostonians experienced the flavors and sounds of Icelandic culture at the Taste of Iceland Festival, an event promoting tourism and Icelandic products in the United States, held this past weekend.
In its tenth year in Boston, Taste of Iceland, hosted by the marketing organization Iceland Naturally, has developed a following of people both with and without previous connections to Iceland.
“This is our third time coming,” attendee Rachel Busch said. “We visited Iceland a few years ago on vacation and we loved it, so we wanted to keep doing things that would remind us of our trip. We really enjoy the food and the music nights because you really get to try or hear something new and different.”
The festival is divided into four nights of different cultural experiences. Beginning on Friday and throughout the weekend, guests could sample Icelandic cuisine prepared by chef Thrainn Freyr Vigfússon, with a menu including Icelandic cod, skyr, and cocktails.
On Saturday, a combination of Icelandic and local bands performed at the Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub in an event dubbed “Reykjavik Calling.” Among the four groups performing was a diverse range of music genres, from folk to rock.
Performers credited Iceland’s competitive music industry with allowing them the freedom to juxtapose multiple genres in their musical work.
“We make electric rock with some folky bits in there,” said Hafsteinn Þráinsson, a member of the Icelandic band Ceasetone that performed at Reykjavik Calling.
“The reason why we’ve been able to put these diverse styles together is because the Icelandic music scene isn’t influenced by any major currents or labels, so creation just happens anyway,” Þráinsson said.
The Icelandic film “Rokk í Reykjavik” was also screened at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge on Sunday night. The film, which translates to “Rock and Reykjavik,” follows the story of Icelandic rock stars in the early 80s. Sigtryggur Baldursson, the managing director of Iceland Music Export, led a discussion about the film and Iceland’s contemporary music scene following the screening.
Taste of Iceland also hosted a night of Icelandic literature at the Prudential Center Barnes and Noble on Monday. Eliza Reid, founder of Iceland Writers Retreat, gave a talk about Iceland as an inspirational environment for writers.
At the end of the festival, organizers said they hope guests will leave with a new appreciation for and understanding of the unique culture of Iceland.
“Our best product is the culture. We are known for our culture. For us, culture is always number one,” said Kristjana Rós Guðjohnsen, manager of tourism and creative industries at Promote Iceland.

In its final competitive action of the season, Harvard men’s squash sent just one member, junior co-captain Bryan Koh, to compete in the Pool Division of the CSA Individual National Championships.
Participating in the event for the third straight time for the Crimson, Koh finished the weekend higher than his individual seeding for a third year with a 1-2 record overall. However, as the tournament field shifted from 32 to 16 players this season, the junior polished off the weekend with the highest individual ranking of his career.
“Squash-wise, I played possibly the best all season, and it's been a learning process tactically and mentally,” Koh said. “It's been a great year and I am happy with the improvements I've made since coming to college.”
Seeded 14th in the event, Koh faced off against the No. 3 seed, University of Rochester junior Mario Yanez, in the first round on Friday at Chelsea Piers in Stamford, Conn. The Singapore native was unable to best Yanez in a 3-0 decision, sending him to the consolation round.
In the first game of the match, Koh didn’t gain much traction, as Yanez came out firing in an 11-2 result.  But after collecting himself in the 90 seconds between the first two sets, Koh put forth a more concerted effort throughout the rest of the match, losing the final two games by a total of four points—12-10, 11-9.
Building on his momentum from the back portion of the previous match, Koh pulled out a five game victory—8-11, 11-9, 11-5, 10-12, 11-5—against his competitor in the quarterfinals of the consolation round, Bates’ ninth-seeded Ahmed Hatata.
Koh was unable to continue the streak against his next opponent in the semis. A defeat against Penn’s Marwan Mahmoud—11-6, 11-9, 11-8—forced the junior out of the tournament.  The loss ended Koh’s individual unbeaten streak against the Quaker’s top three players this season, as he previously bested the two players directly below Mahmoud at the top of Penn’s ladder, Hayes Murphy and Karim Tarek, during team events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week ago, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team called on its offense, and its attackers responded in style, firing home 21 goals in a rout of St. Mary’s. This weekend, it was the defense’s turn to lead the Crimson.
Harvard (3-1, 1-0 Ivy) opened Ancient Eight play in New York this Saturday with a 15-6 win over Columbia (1-2, 0-1). Although the Crimson offense was productive once again, it was a determined display from the backfield unit that secured the victory, as the defense held the Lions to their lowest goals total in the matchup since 2012.
“The defense was disruptive,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “They never let Columbia get comfortable or establish a rhythm.”
Harvard entered the game ranked in the top 20 in the country for scoring defense, and the backfield unit lived up to its billing against the Lions. Co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis led the defensive effort, tallying seven saves, while junior midfielder Meghan Hennessey took control of the outfield, picking up a game-high six ground balls and forcing three turnovers.
“Megan played incredibly well on the defensive side of the ball,” co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd said. “She lit a spark on defense and made the offense want to capitalize on her impressive play once the ball transitioned down the field.”
Despite an increased focus on the backfield, the Crimson, boasting the 17th-best scoring offense in the nation, did not disappoint on attack. The win marked the third game this season in which Harvard totaled 15 or more goals, and nine different Crimson players found the back of the net on the day.
“The team played like a complete unit today,” sophomore midfielder Glynn said. “It began with the stops on the defensive side and ended with finishing by the offensive unit. The energy from the defense made the attack want to capitalize on their great play.”
Spearheading the potent Harvard offense was junior attacker Marisa Romeo. The Syracuse, N.Y., native picked up an assist and notched a game-high four goals, taking her season total to 10. Glynn also continued her run of impressive performances, setting up three goals and scoring one of her own over the course of the afternoon.
The Crimson’s formidable attacking unit wasted no time in making its presence felt, as Romeo put the team on the scoreboard with her first goal of the afternoon a mere 41 seconds after the whistle. Junior attacker Maeve McMahon and freshman midfielder Keeley MacAfee added to Harvard’s momentum shortly afterwards, scoring less than a minute apart to put the Crimson ahead, 3-0.
Columbia found the back of the net twice to bring the score within one, but the Harvard backfield recovered, holding the Lions scoreless for the remainder of the half, while the Crimson attack exploded for a flurry of points.
Sophomore attacker Eliza Guild tallied two goals, and senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia collected one of her own before McMahon and Glynn each found the back of the net.
Romeo then picked up two more quick goals in the final five minutes of the first half to cap a 7-0 run and put Harvard ahead, 10-2, at the whistle.
Both the Crimson’s offensive and defensive units continued to shine in the second period.
Nicolia would score again shortly after the restart to stretch Harvard’s advantage to nine, and the Crimson defense kept Columbia off the board until nine minutes into the second half. In total, Harvard held the Lions scoreless for over 30 minutes between Columbia’s second and third goals.
While the back line continued to hold firm, the Crimson offense kept the contest out of reach for the Lions. Romeo would find the back of the Columbia net for the fourth time with 20 minutes left in the second half before providing the assist for a goal from Todd just 16 seconds later.
Tallies from Hennessey and senior attacker Meghan Bauer sealed the victory and pushed Harvard’s run of wins against Columbia to seven-straight. The win also extended the Crimson’s record against the Lions in New York to a perfect 9-0.
“The bottom line is that we did our job out on the field today,” Todd said. “We knew Columbia would give us a good fight, and we did a great job of making sure we set the pace of the game on offense and played solid defense on the opposite end of the field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hardworking, high-energy, and hungry—the Harvard men’s volleyball team may have earned a number of H-flavored praises last Saturday, but “hospitable” was not one of them.
Hosting Sacred Heart at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson thrashed the visitors, 3-0, to strengthen a hold on second place in the EIVA. Harvard is now two games behind league-leading Penn State, which has won 17 straight conference titles.
“I don’t think we’ve had a start like this since my freshman year,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “We’re feeling really good right now.”
Midway through the third set, with the Crimson trailing 17-13, the Pioneers’ Doug Dzema held the ball, and Sacred Heart held the momentum.
Minutes before Harvard had sported an 11-9 lead, the beneficiaries of three consecutive errors by Sacred Heart.
But the Pioneers had closed the gap and seized the lead. On the strength of three straight kills, Sacred Heart had opened up a four-point advantage and hushed the Harvard crowd—which was the reason that Dzema was behind the line right now, preparing for his third serve.
As a matter of fact, it turned out to be the junior’s final serve of the game. Harvard fielded the ball, junior outside hitter Casey White smashed it over the net, and that energetic response was all the prodding that the Crimson needed.
Capitalizing on a bevy of Pioneers errors, Harvard used an 8-1 stretch to take control. The frame ended at 25-21, with captain Branden Clemens clinching the match with a kill.
“Last night was a good game,” Clemens said. “We were playing some really good team defense.”
Harvard outside hitter Casey White was a star on the afternoon, setting a career high with 21 digs. He also contributed nine kills on a 47.1 hitting percentage.
Yet White received help from many teammates, with the offense posting a kill rate a smidgen below 40 percent and the defense putting up 13 blocks. Five players recorded seven or more kills, and Clemens topped the balanced attack with 11 overall.
“They’re a very good defensive team,” Schlossman said. “But we knew that as long as our serve-receive stayed strong and we were in system for most of the game, then we shouldn’t have a problem on the offensive end.”
Nowhere was the team effort more effective than at the start of the second frame, when sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch served the Crimson through a 6-0 run.
Although the Pioneers responded with a 5-0 run of their own, Harvard never relinquished the lead, completing a 25-21 win with a kill by freshman middle blocker Trevor Dow.
Throughout the season, middle blockers have put up efficient offensive numbers for the Crimson, and Saturday proved no different.
Among all players who attempted three or more attacks, sophomore middle blocker Riley Moore posted the highest kill rate at 80 percent while Dow was not far behind at 67. All afternoon the duo hit over a Sacred Heart defense that recorded as many blocks (two) as blocking errors.
The Pioneers’ offense largely came from the trio of Michael Comens, Chris Delucie, and Austin Arcala. All three players racked up nine or more kills, and Comens topped his squad with 13 finishes.
In the first set, the Crimson battled back from an early two-point deficit to tie the game at seven. The teams traded points until later in the set, when Harvard held a 19-18 lead. Then, partly thanks to four errors by Sacred Heart, the hosts turned on the jets, winning six of the last seven points for a 25-19 victory.
The Crimson limited the Pioneers to a 6 percent kill rate in the frame, an early indication of defensive dominance. For the fifth straight contest, Harvard ended with double-digit blocks as a team, led by five by Moore.
The victory positions the Crimson a full game ahead of St. Francis in the conference, roughly half of EIVA competition remains to be played.
“We want to be winning our conference,” Clemens said. “Ideally we want to win out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard softball traveled south for the second consecutive weekend, and the Crimson (4-4) dropped its first three games at the Eagle Classic in Statesboro, Ga. before earning a victory against Eastern Kentucky.
“This weekend was an opportunity to develop and grow through facing better competition than the previous weekend,” Captain Zoe Galindo said. “It was good to see better, faster pitching and teams that played at a slightly quicker pace of game.”
“We’re working on putting all three pieces of our game together at once, and when we do that we’re an unstoppable team,” Galindo added.
HARVARD 5, EASTERN KENTUCKY 2
Harvard picked up its lone win of the weekend in its final game, a rematch of Saturday’s first game against Eastern Kentucky (12-5).
Junior first baseman Savannah Bradley hit her first home run of the season and drove in three runs, and freshman catcher Elizabeth Shively added two more RBI to lead the Crimson to a 5-2 win.
Harvard jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the top of the third and never relinquished the advantage behind a complete-game win from junior starter Taylor Cabe.
Cabe went the distance and scattered five hits and two runs while setting down five batters by strikeout.
Shortstop Rhianna Rich continued to pile up hits in the first few weeks of her college career. Last week’s Ivy League Rookie of the Week singled twice in four at bats and scored a run.
NORTH DAKOTA 3, HARVARD 1
After giving up 12 runs against host Georgia Southern, the Crimson’s pitching staff rebounded to hold North Dakota (5-13) to three runs.
However, Harvard’s hitters were no match for North Dakota’s Kaylin VanDomelen. The redshirt sophomore tossed seven innings of one-run ball and struck out 12 members of the Crimson.
Harvard only managed three hits, all singles, against the Fighting Hawks’ starter.
“We saw some strong pitching that really challenged our hitters and forced us to get better,” Cabe said.
Senior Taylor Hansen, freshman Mary Martin, and junior Rachael Waynick drove in one run apiece for North Dakota, with Waynick’s RBI coming off a home run.
GEORGIA SOUTHERN 12, HARVARD 2 (5 innings)
Georgia Southern (12-7) scored early and often against the Crimson, putting five runs on the scoreboard in its first inning at the plate and building a 10-run lead which cut the game short at 5 innings.
Harvard’s batters struggled mightily against a dominant Dixie Raley. The freshman pitched all five innings and only gave up one earned run and four hits while striking out four.
The Eagles racked up 10 hits, including three doubles and two round-trippers. Sophomore outfielder Alexa Altchek recorded the Crimson’s only extra base hit, a double. That marked the second time in Saturday’s two games that Harvard was unable to muster more than one hit for extra bases.
“Even without the high number of extra base hits, we can still score a lot of runs as long as every batter does their job according to the situation,” Galindo said.
EASTERN KENTUCKY 7, HARVARD 6
In the Crimson’s first contest at the Eagle Classic, Harvard dropped a close decision to the Colonels in the seventh inning.
Heading into the final frame, the score was knotted at six. Captain Morgan Groom stepped into the circle for her fifth inning of relief after the Crimson had just tied the game up by pushing two runners across the plate in the bottom of the sixth.
Groom recorded two quick outs to begin the inning, but eventually Eastern Kentucky’s Rachel Minogue delivered with an RBI single to the left-center gap which plated Kayla Joyce for the go-ahead run.
In the bottom of the seventh, junior Alex Sallberg shut down the Harvard offense to preserve the lead for the Colonels. Eastern Kentucky committed four errors, and the Crimson was able to capitalize. Four of its six runs were unearned.
Harvard stranded nine runners on the day, which ties a season-high set in a win against Presbyterian in the season opener.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the end of their seasons on the line, three Crimson athletes managed to extend competition another two weeks at the EIWA Championships. In addition, senior Devon Gobbo captured an EIWA title at 165 lbs., becoming the 22nd Harvard wrestler to complete the feat in program history.
Thanks to their performances, Gobbo, co-captain Todd Preston, and junior Josef Johnson booked their tickets to Madison Square Garden for NCAAs, while several other Harvard wrestlers registered individual wins as well. The Crimson finished in ninth place, with a team score of 60.5.
“It was a rollercoaster of a tournament,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “I thought the guys did well, [and] we wanted to finish higher, but we still did well. We have a few guys going on the nationals...and I’m happy with that.”
Harvard saw several of its wrestlers fall early in the competition to injury, making a tough start for the Crimson.
“Those guys were guys who we had expected to go on and score some big points for the team,” Weiss said. “So it’s disappointing to have that happen. We had wanted to finish the tournament top five, but I still feel like we reached that since we weren’t too far from there points-wise.”
The standout performance of the weekend came from Gobbo at 165 lbs. Two years after Harvard’s last EIWA individual championship won by Todd Preston, Gobbo added his name to the list of Harvard wrestlers who have secured the title.
In the final match that stood between him and the Eastern Championship title, Gobbo faced off with an opponent who had pinned him at the beginning of the season at the Cliff Keen Invitational in Las Vegas, NV.
“Devon looked great throughout the tournament,” Weiss said. “For him to come back and beat that same guy is so exciting, and is just a testament to how much he’s grown. He can wrestle with anybody, and I’ve told him he looked awesome today.”
For the past three years, Gobbo has had fragmented seasons thanks to a multitude of injuries. In spite of these setbacks, the No. 20-ranked senior out grappled with Cornell’s Duke Pickett, the top seed of the tournament.
“My senior year of high school I missed the state tournament because of an injury, so instead of competing in that, I went and watched my future teammates wrestle in this same tournament at Princeton,” Gobbo said. “So from then on, it was a huge goal of mine, and getting it done at that same arena was really a dream come true.”
Sophomore Josef Johnson also notched his first bid to the NCAA tournament, outlasting his opponent through three overtime frames to earn a sixth-place finish.
“It was frustrating for him when he got pushed into overtime over a call, but he stayed really tough,” Weiss said. “That was a really exciting bout for all of us.”
Preston finished closely behind Gobbo, notching a second place finish at 141 lbs. The senior wasn’t able to repeat his sophomore year EIWA title, falling to Franklin and Marshall’s Richard Durso in the championship bout.
“He’s a warrior,” Weiss said. “He did awesome. Durso is very difficult to wrestle against. He has a certain style that you have to adjust to, and Todd did a good job of that…. Todd’s been at the NCAA tournament before, he’s been knocking on the door to being an All-American, and I have the utmost confidence in what he’s going to do in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite strong offensive showings from all three outgoing senior starters, the Harvard women’s basketball team (14-13, 9-5 Ivy) finished up an otherwise promising campaign with a couple defeats on the road against Penn and Princeton.
The Killer P’s both completed season sweeps of the Crimson, accounting for four of its five Ancient Eight losses. The Tigers (23-4, 12-1 Ivy) won Friday night’s contest, 79-69, thanks to a couple of big runs in the middle of the game. The Quakers (23-4, 12-1 Ivy) then came out ahead, 62-46, on Saturday night. Penn and Princeton will vie for the Ivy League title on Tuesday night.
Harvard struggled with rebounding and paint presence, recording double digit deficits in both rebounding and points in the paint in each game. Captain AnnMarie Healy rounded out her most complete season for the Crimson with another strong weekend, posting 21 points against the Tigers before dropping a team-high 17 against the Quakers. She finishes with 954 career points.
“My seniors are very proud of what they’ve accomplished,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It was short of what our ultimate goal was, but I thought their leadership, their hard work, they were great captains and great role models. They were instrumental in getting the culture back where I wanted it at Harvard. Next year, they’ve laid the groundwork for us to be a pretty strong team.”
Penn 62, Harvard 46
After being held to 25.0% shooting in the teams’ first matchup at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson’s shooters went cold once again against the Quakers, making just 16-of-56 (28.6%) from the field at The Palestra.
Healy went 6-for-12 from the floor for her 27th game with double figures in points this season, but her four fellow starters combined to make just six of their 29 attempts. The Crimson shot 21.7% from three-point range and made just 9-of-14 free throws as well.
Harvard started the game well, using a 5-0 solo run by senior Shilpa Tummala to take a 15-12 lead after one quarter. A dismal offensive second quarter doomed them, however, as they shot just 1-of-15 from the field; Penn overwhelmed them, 15-2, in the period to take a ten point halftime lead.
“We played really well,” Delaney-Smith said, “and I thought we started strong, played well, but unfortunately had a stretch where we couldn’t score. That was our demise.... We dug a hole and couldn’t recover from that.”
Quakers’ star forward Michelle Nwokedi was a thorn in the Crimson’s side, scoring 18 to go along with 14 rebounds. She helped Penn maintain a 51-37 edge on the glass and 30-20 scoring margin in the paint.
“I think we actually did a pretty decent job on them,” Tummala said. “We are undersized, they have four or five of the best post players combined in the country. We don’t necessarily have the size, but we fought.”
Six straight points by Healy cut the gap to seven midway through the third, but an immediate reply from the Quakers was capped off by a Kasey Chambers three-pointer that pushed their lead to 20 after three quarters.
Princeton 79, Harvard 69
Despite 24 points from captain Kit Metoyer and 21 from Healy, the Crimson could not outlast Ivy frontrunners Princeton at Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton, N.J. on Friday night.
Harvard grabbed a 14-7 lead midway through the first quarter only to see the Tigers go on a 10-0 run in the final 3:30 of the period and take a 20-16 advantage into the break. The home side grabbed seven offensive rebounds over the course of four possessions during that spurt.
“We were scoring against Princeton, we were getting stops, so they decided to go to the boards,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s what veteran teams do; if you’re sets aren’t working or your sets aren’t falling, you go to the boards.”
The teams went back and forth from there, with the Tigers stretching their lead to 11 at one point in the second quarter before a pair of Metoyer triples brought the Crimson back within three, 47-44, midway through the third.
Ultimately, Harvard was undone by another demoralizing Princeton run, with the Tigers opening the fourth quarter with 14 unanswered points to stretch their lead to 20, 71-51. During that time, the Crimson missed seven field goals and committed four turnovers.
“As a young team, we got stuck in our own heads,” Tummala said. “We didn’t score for a long time and they were scoring… you need to put the ball in the basket to win games. We couldn’t convert, and they’re a veteran team and they took advantage of that drought. That’s what killed us.”
Seniors Annie Tarakchian and Michelle Miller paced the Tigers with 24 and 20 points respectively, shooting a combined 16-of-27 from the field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. The Harvard women’s squash team (13-0, 7-0 Ivy) sent five players to Stamford, Conn., over the weekend to compete in the CSA Individual Championships this pas weekend. The team, which had had a dominant, undefeated season, came away with neither the Ramsay Cup nor the Holleran Cup.
RAMSAY CUP
The Crimson’s top three players, freshmen Sabrina Sobhy and Kayley Leonard, and sophomore Alyssa Mehta competed for the coveted Ramsay Cup.
Sobhy, who is ranked No. 2 and holds a 9-1 record on the year at the No. 1 spot, had just helped her team to win the team championships with a dominant performance the previous outing, including a game-winning match.
No. 5-ranked Leonard posted a 10-1 record, mostly at the No. 2 position, and also had a strong performance in the team championships.
Sobhy was matched up against Penn’s No. 4 player Marie Stephan in the first round. Sobhy, who had played a tough match against Stephan’s teammate just last weekend, knew going into the match that it was going to be one that she had to fight for. After losing the first two games, it seemed that the Quaker was going to get the best of Sobhy. But the freshman rallied to take three straight games, earning her a spot in the quarterfinals.
Leonard competed against George Washington’s Anna Porras in the opening round of 16. She dominated against the Colonial, dropping only one game to win, 3-1.
“I’m overall very happy with the way that I played this weekend,” Leonard said. “No match that I played this weekend was easy…. The semi final match was very tough and close, but Kanzy proved to be the better player that day [and] was deserving of the match.”
No. 13 Mehta had a 10-2 run this year, playing mainly at the No. 3 spot. Mehta’s opening match of her second Ramsay Cup bid was against current Ivy Rookie of the Year, Princeton’s Olivia Fiechter, but the Crimson player fell, 3-1.
On Saturday, both Leonard and Sobhy were met with stiff competition and could not pull out the victory.
Earlier, in the day, Leonard avenged Mehta’s loss and made quick of her Fiechter with a 3-1 win, but fell to Trinity’s Kanzy El-Defrawy, 3-0, in the semifinal round.
Despite picking up a win in one of the games, Sobhy was unable to ride the momentum of her win the day before and lost, 3-1, to St. Lawrence’s Samy Laila.
In the consolation rounds, Mehta swept her opponents—Porras and Trinity’s Raneem Sharaf—in both the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, which earned her a spot in the finals. Mehta then played Marie Stephan but lost.
“The highlight of my season was definitely winning the national title last weekend,” Leonard said. “I only recently realized how special of a feeling it is to be a member of a national championship team.”
HOLLERAN CUP
Both junior Dileas MacGowan and freshman Sophie Mehta made their postseason debuts in the Individual tournaments, with MacGowan vying for the D division trophy, and Mehta for the A division title.
MacGowan went for 11-2 this year while playing mainly at the No. 8 spot but seeing action at four other spots in the Crimson lineup. She played William’s Hayley Parsons in the round of 16, handing her opponent in a 3-1 win. She then lost by that score in the quarterfinal round against George Washington’s Breanne Flynn.
No. 49 Sophie Mehta had an 11-1 record in the eighth and ninth spots in the lineup. She was swept by Quaker Haidi Lala in the opening round, and faced St. Lawrence’s Emily Terry in the consolation quarterfinals. Like her elder sister, Mehta swept Terry and her semifinal round opponent to make it to the final round.
“I think some of my tactics got better over the season,” Mehta said. “Squash is a game that involves a lot of thinking and our coaches always emphasize playing 'smart' squash. I've tried to be more aware of the shots I hit over the season.”
She then faced Mary Fung-A-Fat in the finals, and swept her to take the consolation final match.
“I think I played well,” Mehta said. “It was nice to get to play some different girls who we don't play in team matches. We don't play Drexel as a team, but I played two girls from Drexel this weekend, so that was a good experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a successful fall season, in which the two divisions of the squad totaled 31 top-ten marks, the Harvard sailing team traveled down to Providence, R.I. this weekend to compete in the opening regatta of its spring season — the Sharpe Trophy Team Race hosted by Brown.  Seven athletes made the trip to represent the Crimson, racing in FJ vessels and Z420 dinghies against competitors from nine other top-tier collegiate sailing programs.
The Crimson squad finished the weekend with an overall 5-4 record for the regatta.
Historically, Harvard has performed well at this regatta, taking first in 2011.  However, the past two iterations of the Sharpe race were cancelled due to unsailable conditions.  This year, while the officials ultimately did not call off the event, the meager winds proved barely sufficient.
“Quite frankly, [the competition] was running despite less than ideal conditions,” senior skipper Marek Zaleski said.  “There weren’t really ample breezes and it was light and fluky pretty much the whole weekend.”
On Saturday, the racing commenced around 10:30 with a chilly north breeze of 8-12 knots, which gradually lightened up and shifted east throughout the day, resulting in progressively slower times across the board.  Nevertheless, the Crimson managed to finish the day with a 3-3 record with victories over Brown, Rhode Island, and Roger Williams, giving the squad a preliminary fourth place position for the day.  Capitalizing on the home field advantage, the Bears’ top boat finished the first day tallying six victories and emerging undefeated.
Moving into Sunday, the winds continued to be stagnant — remaining almost entirely in the single digits — frustrating sailors and race officials alike.  Despite this hurdle, the Harvard boats finished their respective races with a 2-1 record for Sunday, which placed them fifth overall in the competition.  However, since it did not place in the top four, the Crimson was precluded from participating in the last three races of the event.  Brown’s first boat wound up maintaining its early lead from Saturday and topped the regatta with an overall 10-2 record. Dartmouth earned a close runner-up position with a 9-3 performance.
“The results didn’t necessarily go as we wanted, but even in spite of that, I think we had a lot of good elements to draw from there,” sophomore co-captain Nick Sertl said.  “We’re looking forward to next weekend where we can hopefully get some racing in normal conditions.”
While the team’s placement did not meet expectations, the members of the squad are keeping this race in perspective and focusing on the bigger picture.
“The key to this season is going to be solid performance all around,” Zaleski said.  “All these upcoming regattas are mostly training for the big ones, which are New England’s and if we do well there, we go to Nationals.”
The New England Team Race Championship will be held at the Coast Guard Academy on April 9.   The Harvard squad is mindful of this date and understands how critical this upcoming month will be for honing individual boat feel and working together as a team.  The team mentality is especially important because, whereas in the fall the races are mostly individual, the early portion of the spring season consists almost entirely of team races.
“In setting goals for the [Sharpe Trophy Team Race] and the season, I think the emphasis is really on the fact that this is a process,” Sertl said. “It’s sort of our first time sailing together as a team, so I think that will take a little bit of getting used to, but I think we’re doing well with that.”

The Harvard track and field team set a number of personal bests and Ivy League records at the IC4A/ECAC Championships, hosted Saturday and Sunday at Boston University. Only 12 Harvard athletes were chosen to compete at the event, which featured athletes from more than 40 schools across the region.
On the men’s side, the meet was highlighted by a record-breaking performance from freshman Myles Marshall, who scored the top time in the event preliminaries by finishing the 500-meter dash in 1:01.63 seconds. Marshall did not compete in the event finals.
Marshall’s mark is the fastest time in the country this year—more than four-tenths of a second quicker than the second-fastest time—and is also a personal and Harvard-best. His run would have claimed first at the Ivy championships last weekend by more than a second.
Sophomore Ben Huffman also set a personal best in the 3000-meter run with a time of 8:13.62, good for sixth place out of 24 competitors.
The women’s side experienced similar success, claiming a trio of silver medals in the 1000-meter run, 400-meter dash, and pole vault. On the basis of those performances, the women’s Harvard squad scored an 11th place finish out of 44 teams despite fielding only four athletes who competed in event finals.
Senior Paige Kouba set a new Ivy-League record and personal best in the 1000 meters on her way to a second-place finish. Kouba completed the race in 2:44.76 seconds, roughly seven-tenths of a second faster than the previous Ivy record of 2:45.42 seconds.
Senior Autumne Franklin, fresh off a victory at the Ivy League championships, beat her personal record in the 400 meters twice, first by running a 53.64 in the preliminaries and one-upping that with a time of 53.03 seconds in the finals—nearly nine-tenths of a second faster than her old record before the meet.
Franklin’s finals time represents the second fastest in Harvard history—behind only a 52.96 mark, run back in 1990 by two-time Olympian Meredith Rainey—and was more than a second and a half faster than Franklin’s winning time last weekend at the Ivy champs.
Elsewhere, junior pole-vaulter Marlee Sabatino scored a second place finish behind a vault of 12’7.5”, capping off a successful meet for the Harvard field squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team opened their sevens with a strong showing against both old and new opponents this Saturday at the second annual Frostbite 7s Tournament. Hosted by the Crimson, the tournament was played in the sevens format with seven players on the field rather than a full 15 for each side.
In the first tournament of the sevens season, Harvard had an overall record of 5-1 against MIT, Siena, Yale, and New Hampshire this Saturday at Harvard Stadium, with the home team being split into Crimson and Black groups. The Crimson squad went 3-0 on the day and won the tournament, while the Black team finished 2-1 in third place.
“It was...a warm-up tournament with teams from all over, not really teams in our bracket, but it really went fantastic,” sophomore Maya Learned said. “I couldn’t have been happier with the results.”
CRIMSON SQUAD
It was just one of those days for the defense of the Crimson squad this weekend, as everything seemed to go its way en route to a 130-0 overall score.
The team played three games on the day without letting their opponents score a single try.
“Everybody came together,” Learned said. “It just really speaks to the girls’ work ethic and their willingness to commit to the defense plan that we have in place.”
The team’s first pool play game was against MIT, the only other team who played in last year’s Frostbite 7s Tournament. After coming out to a 29-0 advantage in the seven minutes, the Crimson squad ended the game 67-0. Dalton Youngblood, a sophomore out of Dallas, scored six tries in the match.
In the second pool play game, the Crimson’s defense held strong against Siena’s offensive attack, winning the match 46-0. The team entered halftime with a 24-0 lead before winning their pool.
The Crimson team’s last game was against New Hampshire in the first place game, and Harvard blanked its opponent, 17-0. Youngblood scored another two tries in the match.
“Sevens is a simplified version of 15s in some ways were your skills have to be really on top of it,” Learned said. “But it’s a very fun, really enjoyable way to...get a good feeling of the game.”
BLACK SQUAD
Contrary to the Crimson squad’s blow-out pool play games, the Black team was engaged in two defensive slugfests against Yale and New Hampshire, with the games totalling a score of 17-17. The Black team ended pool play 1-1 before winning the third place game against Siena.
With just over two minutes left in the Black team’s first pool play game against rival Yale, freshman Grace Chao scored a go-ahead try in what proved to be a 17-7 victory for Harvard.
“We have a lot of people who haven’t played sevens before balanced with a lot of people who had pretty high level experience with sevens,” Chao said. “Everybody contributed something significant. Our brand new players seemed to really enjoy it.”
The lone Harvard loss of the day came in the Black team’s second pool play game against New Hampshire. The Wildcats had a 10-0 lead at halftime which they retained throughout the game, shutting out the Black team.
The Black team, however, was able to win the third place game by blanking SIena 19-0. The freshmen were involved in this game as well, as Genevieve Quirion scored the opening try of the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first 20 minutes of their showdown, both No. 12/12 Harvard and No. 4/4 Duke lived up to their billings as two of the best teams in the country. The squads traded impressive goals, each trying to seize momentum and control of the game.
By the 10:10 mark of the second quarter, both teams had already found the back of the net five times. Neither had led by more than one goal at any point, and at 5-5, it looked like the Crimson was knotted in yet another close matchup.
After playing overtime in all three of its games thus far, however, and only leading for a total of about 25 minutes in those games despite coming back to win every one of them, Harvard erupted at the right time to put away the Blue Devils early. With an 8-0 run spanning most of the second period and lasting into the fourth, it put the game out of reach.
The Crimson (4-0, 0-0 Ivy) went on to secure a 14-9 victory, a big improvement after being overwhelmed at Duke (4-2, 0-0 ACC) by a 21-14 margin last season. In the process, it held the Blue Devils to a single-digit goal count for the first time since they lost to No. 1/1 Syracuse almost a year ago.
“The game was at a neutral site, but with a lot of the guys on the team from Long Island and the other areas around there [Shuart Stadium at Hofstra University], it felt almost like a home game,” Harvard co-captain Stephen Jahelka said. “A whole bunch of us had family and friends out there, and that helped us a lot.
Team play and cohesion were key for the Crimson on both sides of the ball during its big run, as six of  its seven second quarter goals came off assists. Senior attackman Devin Dwyer claimed three of these tallies and assisted on another to provide the main driving force behind his team’s run.
“We were bringing the energy the entire game, and we were able to put all of that together in one big run,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ‘96 said. “Our ability to win the crucial ground balls and play in transition were key to our success.”
At intermission, with the Crimson holding a 10-5 lead, Dwyer had the same number of points as Duke had goals. With a late assist to complete a six-point performance, he leads the country with 6.25 points-per-game.
Sophomore goalie Robert Shaw remains undefeated after making a string of tough saves in the second and third quarters.
When the game was still hanging in the balance with Harvard clinging on to a 6-5 advantage, Shaw made a reflex stick save on an uncontested shot in front of goal by Blue Devils junior attackman Jack Bruckner. Shaw proceeded to make two saves on star midfielder Myles Jones in the third quarter. Jones was recently picked No. 1 overall in the Major League Lacrosse draft, but finished the day against the Crimson without a goal.
“[Shaw] was huge in net all game and made several timely saves,” Wojcik said. “It definitely started with the entire defense, though. Duvnjak and Breit did a great job rotating on Jones and everyone else was shifting well too.”
Sophomore attackmen Morgan Cheek and Justin Guterding also had standout performances for Harvard and Duke, respectively, both scoring three goals and assisting on three others.
Harvard pulled out the victory by limiting penalties and causing disruption in the Blue Devils defensive zone. Duke completed only 16 of 25 clear attempts, failing to find a rhythm on offense until the game was out of reach.
“It was probably the best team performance, top to bottom, that we’ve had all season,” Jahelka said. “It’s good to finally get a win against them before I graduate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At home in Blodgett Pool for the Harvard Invitational, the No. 16 Harvard women’s water polo team finished the weekend with three victories by double-digit margins and one loss that came in a disappointing fashion on senior night.
Saturday evening’s game against Princeton honored Crimson seniors Yoshi Andersen, Charlotte Hendrix, and Rachel Lobato, drawing a large crowd of Harvard supporters.
“[These seniors] came and took a chance to come here and they’ve led very well,” coach Ted Minnis said. “They are leaving as the winningest class ever.”
The Crimson (11-2) opened the weekend with a 13-goal victory over Mercyhurst (4-6), but was unable to keep the momentum through the evening. Harvard dropped a close contest against No. 20 Princeton (9-1) on Saturday afternoon before returning on Sunday with 11-goal wins over both Siena College (1-12) and Fresno Pacific (7-7).
HARVARD 18, FRESNO PACIFIC 7
The Crimson offense generated more than sufficient goals against Fresno Pacific, churning out 18 en route to an 11-goal victory over the Sunbirds. Freshman attacker Kristen Hong scored three times, bringing her total on the day to nine, and along with Andersen and sophomore attacker Sami Strutner, who each tallied four goals, led the team in sweeping day two of the Harvard Invitational.
Both sophomore Cleo Harrington and freshman Sam Acker spent time in goal for the Crimson to wrap up the tournament.
HARVARD 16, SIENA 5
Junior attacker Michelle Martinelli set the tone of the game by scoring 11 seconds into the first frame, and a supporting cast of junior attacker Melissa Balding, Hendrix, Lobato and Hong each found the net multiple times to pace Harvard in its victory over Siena, 16-5.
The Saints scored for the first time just before the end of the first half, making the halftime score 10-1.
The Crimson was outscored 3-1 in the third quarter, but recovered with five goals during the final period to finish the game with its first 11-goal victory of the day.
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 8
Even with top Princeton goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson taking the year off to train for the Olympics, and Harvard entering the contest with the higher ranking and its best start to the season since 1995, the Crimson could not break its 21-game losing streak to the Tigers.
“We consider [Princeton] to be a huge rival for us and we knew it was going to be a big challenge,” Harrington said. “I think we came out not as confident as we should have. We were physically prepared for that game, but I think the mental side wasn’t quite there yet.”
Although Hong staked Harvard to an early 2-0 lead, Princeton quickly neutralized the score. In response, Strutner found the goal at the end of the first frame to give Harvard a 3-2 advantage after one quarter.
The Tigers matched the Crimson goal-for-goal in the second quarter, but just before the half, Princeton broke away with two unanswered goals to take a 7-5 lead, an advantage it didn’t relinquish.
Balding and Hong each found the net once during the third frame, and Hong scored the lone Harvard goal in the final quarter on a penalty shot, but their efforts were not enough to close the gap.
“I told the girls this didn’t define our season,” Minnis said. “We play Princeton at Michigan in….April and we’ll get another crack at them.”
HARVARD 17, MERCYHURST 4
Ten different players tallied goals for the Crimson, and a dominating first frame, in which it scored seven unanswered goals, sparked Harvard to a 13-goal victory over Mercyhurst.
Hendrix, Martinelli, Strutner, Lobato, and Hong all contributed to the offensive surge that pushed the Crimson to an early 7-0 lead.
“We came out really aggressive…. and with that attacking mentality,” Harrington said. “We wanted to make the other team react to us and I think we did a really good job of that.”
Freshman Colby Stapleton led Harvard in the second quarter with three goals. Andersen and Hong also each scored a goal to bring the Crimson to a 12-1 advantage at the half, setting Harvard up to maintain a decisive lead throughout the rest of the game.

Here at Harvard, we are in mid thrust of midterm season, and students have already began to barricade themselves within the unforgiving fold of Lamont Cafe  — pillows, textbooks et al. But that’s not the most important news buzzing around campus. For a campus literally filled with aspiring politicians and descendants of major political power players, the true education stands to come from a television show that returned to the most popular streaming service last week: House of Cards.
That’s right. Frank Underwood is back, and Flyby knows the best way to celebrate his return. Take notes, late night partiers: Flyby is about to teach you the best drinking game you’ve ever played in your life.
Take a shot every time:Claire thinks she’s one step ahead of Frank UnderwoodSomeone gets betrayedSomeone says “God bless America”Every time Claire flips her hair (you’ll be dead by morning)
Finish your drink when:Every time that Frank Underwood breaks the fourth wallEvery time Doug is disturbingly loyal to FrankEvery time Frank Underwood burns a bridge with someone who was on his sideEvery time Frank raps his ring against a table
Seeing as you probably have three midterms and two papers this week, chances are these drinking games will have to be on the backburner for the time being. However, with Spring Break on the horizon, we here at Flyby can think of no better way to celebrate all that extra free time than binge watching House of Cards and simultaneously getting tipsy.
