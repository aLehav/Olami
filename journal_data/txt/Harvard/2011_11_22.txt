After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fact that humans can be terribly destructive creatures is inescapable. The proof can be found as much in today’s headlines as in the pages of history. But one would think that a children’s film as seemingly innocent and carefree as “Happy Feet Two” would provide an escape from the harsher world we inhabit. Unfortunately, this is not such a movie. Ostensibly a story about penguins, “Happy Feet Two” is rife with reminders that we humans kill off cute and musically talented sea creatures on a regular basis. We created the global warming that is melting the ice caps; we’ve spilled millions of gallons of oil into the ocean and smothered countless underwater residents; and we’re also the ones who throw those plastic soda rings into the sea that strangle poor fish and birds. But while such a critique might be valuable in a documentary context, it proves an off-putting distraction in what should have been a happy-go-lucky kids’ movie. For all its colorful imagery and impressive use of 3D, “Happy Feet Two” is stuffed with too many storylines, themes, characters, and cringe-worthy songs.
“Happy Feet Two” rejoins the protagonist of its predecessor, Mumble the penguin (voiced by Elijah Wood), who is now a father. His son Erik (Ava Acres) has a problem: he is too timid to join the rest of the penguin colony in their colorful musical dance numbers. But this story is soon overshadowed when the colony is trapped by colliding glaciers, and Mumble, along with Erik and other young penguins, must somehow save it. The posse of penguins enlists the aid of magnificent flying penguin Sven (Hank Azaria) and embarks on a journey to save Emperorland. Along the way, they run into an aggressive elephant seal, sing a few songs, and put up with the antics of the lustful penguin Ramon (Robin Williams).
Alas, this animated sequel is neither as cute nor unaffected as the original. It seems as though the writers of “Happy Feet Two” had too many ideas and attempted to cram them all into a single script, rather than prune the possibilities into a clearer and more focused plot. In particular, there is the overblown cultural critique of human interaction with the penguins—ice caps fall into the ocean due to man’s dependence on fossil fuels, birds nearly perish in a suffocating oil spill, and so on. This portrayal of humans as alien interlopers on idyllic penguin society seems diverting and superfluous at best, and gratuitously political at worst.
Beyond its muddled moralizing, “Happy Feet Two” is hampered by a completely separate storyline that follows the existential crisis of a krill named Will (Brad Pitt), who attempts to defy nature by turning himself into a carnivore. He is coupled with the creatively named Bill the Krill (Matt Damon), who questions Will’s choice to break away from the krill colony. This plotline is completely unnecessary, and seems to exist purely so that the producers can include more A-list celebrities in the film, albeit as utterly extraneous characters.
Not only does the film have too many outlying characters and plotlines, its central location—the penguin colony itself—also has far too much going on. First, there’s the wondrous flying penguin who inspires young Erik to believe he could fly. Then there’s the tragedy that traps the penguin colony. There’s even another segment—a quite macabre one at that—in which an elephant seal practically falls to his death in front of his children. This stacking of storylines makes the film feel off-kilter and clumsy, and its scene changes seem random and uncoordinated.
Amidst this cinematic cacophony, the charm and memorable personalities that should be the stock and trade of any animated children’s movie are completely lost. For one thing, there is just no time for character development. Erik, the supposed new hero of the franchise and an uber-cute baby penguin, is barely introduced, and no connection is established between him and his father, or between him and the audience. His antics are largely forgettable—never a good sign for a protagonist—just like so many other characters in the movie.
The music, an aspect of the movie that had the potential to redeem and distinguish it from other similar flicks, is another disappointment. The dance numbers are tired parodies of outdated songs, like Justin Timberlake’s “SexyBack,” awkwardly redone as “I’m Bringin’ Fluffy Back,” complete with a cluster of strangely gyrating young penguins.
Ultimately, “Happy Feet Two” lacks a crucial element of a quality children’s movie: balance. It tries to do too much and so ends up accomplishing little. The presence of too many personalities results in a film with little personality. For all its 3D glitz and celebrity vocal talent, “Happy Feet Two” simply lacks the lighthearted fun that made its predecessor and its adorable foot-tapping penguins such a success.

“The Descendants” is simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. Its humor and tragedy are so closely intertwined that the laughs hit before the tears can dry. This true-to-life oscillation between the calamitous and the comic allows the film to present its story—that of a man who loses his wife in a boating accident—as not simply a senseless tearjerker but rather a compelling meditation on life, love, and forgiveness.
The raw power of the movie comes from the weighty realism of its main characters. George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer and self-described “back-up parent” whose personal philosophy of “give your children enough [money] to do something, but not enough to do nothing” has not endeared him to his two daughters. Once his wife is incapacitated, the overwhelmed Matt must keep his fraying family together, all the while negotiating the sale of his family’s no-longer-needed 25-acre land plot in Hawaii.
Elizabeth King’s (Patricia Hastie) accident could not have come at a worse time for her family. Matt hadn’t spoken to his wife for three days prior while on a business trip, but “in a way,” he remarks, “[we] hadn’t spoken in months.” Seeing Matt receive the news that his wife is going to be taken off life support—and that he is now solely responsible for their children—is gut-wrenching. The pain, guilt, shock, and grief of the moment are all expertly captured through close-ups of Clooney’s incredibly expressive face.
Clooney may be the perpetual bachelor of Hollywood in real life, but in this film he perfectly embodies King—a husband and father who is just trying to keep his head above water. He’s not quite an ordinary man, but he’s as human as we can expect from a movie character. His struggles, his pain, and small victories become our own.
After he receives the news about his wife, King decides to bring his neglected teenage daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) home from college. Though Alexandra has problems of her own, she helps her father take care of her younger sister Scottie (Amara Miller), a 10-year-old with a propensity for giving the middle finger. Scottie’s is a complex role, especially for a child actor. She is vulgar yet fragile, inquisitive, and quirky. But newcomer Miller pulls it off effortlessly.
Indeed, acting is undeniably the film’s strength, and not just from its big-name lead. Even Nick Krause is able to make Alexandra’s dopey friend Sid into more than just comic relief. The scene in which he nonchalantly tells Matt that his father recently passed away is tender and understated, as Matt finally realizes why Alexandra needs Sid. Few would expect a laid-back surfer to have as much emotional depth as Krause brings to the role. Together, Alexandra, Scottie, and Sid mix moments of bemusement with moments of misery, and along with Clooney lend a rare realism to “The Descendants.”
The lone exception among the film’s exceptional performances is that of Judy Greer, who plays the curiously named Julie Speer—the wife of Elizabeth’s illicit lover—in largely tone-deaf fashion. Perhaps the actress should stick to playing the bitchy best friend character in romantic comedies, as she has in “The Wedding Planner,” “13 Going on 30,” and “27 Dresses.” “The Descendants” seems too multi-layered and serious for her brand of acting.
“The Descendants” has the simplest of plots. It’s a movie more about characters and emotions than clever twists, much like many of writer-director Alexander Payne’s previous projects. The film will not test your brain like “Inception,” and it will not make you laugh like “The Hangover,” but it is a genuine slice of life. And isn’t a movie that makes us laugh, cry, and truly feel all that one could ask for from a day at the cinema?

Apologies in advance to the confused fathers, guilt-tripped boyfriends, and dragged-along younger brothers in the theater—you’re not going to like “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1.” And no one, least of all the actors or director, seems to care. The penultimate installment in this blockbuster series is an entertaining ride for fans, but its terrible dialogue, wooden acting, and lack of a dramatic arc seriously hamper its ability to move beyond its intended demographic of already converted Twilight aficionados.
In the film’s first few minutes, sullen vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and his brooding beau Bella (Kristen Stewart) tie the knot in a predictably lavish ceremony and immediately fly away to Brazil for an exotic honeymoon. This first half of the movie—genuinely lighthearted, filled with in-jokes and references to past installments—is undoubtedly the most enjoyable part. “I haven’t told you everything about myself,” Edward warns Bella the night before their wedding. “What, you’re not a virgin?” she retorts, cuing not only peals of laughter from the predominantly preteen audience but also a genuine appreciation for screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg’s ability to poke fun at the series itself.
As in previous films, Bella’s high school classmates add needed humanity and levity to a script often bogged down by its own self-importance. “Suddenly Edward’s all about Bella,” says the spurned Jessica (Anna Kendrick) in her wedding toast to the couple, “even though she’s not the captain of the volleyball team … or president of the student council.”
Even the vampires get in a few kickers during the movie’s opening moments. Double entendres abound about Bella’s upcoming vampire transformation and marriage. “I hope you got enough sleep these past 18 years,” Edward’s brother Emmett (Kellan Lutz) says, “because you’re not getting any more!” Right on cue, the enamored couple flies off to their island honeymoon, consummates their marriage in a beachside mansion, and explores the breathtaking Isle Esme. Stewart and Pattinson have great chemistry when they stick to this more whimsical fare. In one surprisingly human scene, Bella tries to seduce a reluctant Edward, and Pattinson rolls over and giggles with a compelling contagiousness that demonstrates the actor’s genuine magnetism. This is the relatable Pattinson that people can actually imagine falling in love with, but has rarely been seen throughout the series. So far, so good.
Alas, all semi-tolerable aspects of this movie must come to an end. Increasingly constrained by the progressively more ridiculous plot of the novel, the film comes crashing back to mediocrity in its second half, from the moment Bella realizes that she is pregnant until her macabre birth scene. The material calls for the actors to move quickly between fury, self-restraint, and other heavy emotions—a task for which the photogenic but superficial cast is not quite prepared. Too often, moments of foreboding and darkness are transformed into comic parody through painful overacting.
The worst offenders in this overwrought portion of the drama are werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and his pack. Much has been written about Lautner’s lack of dramatic chops, and nowhere is this more apparent than when the hunky, fresh-faced young man earnestly delivers lines like “I always knew you’d destroy her!” and “it’s a killer, Bella!”
Meanwhile, the crème de la crème of all the film’s missteps manages to implicate its directing, screenwriting, and even CGI. Rubber-like werewolves bound across the sweeping Northwest landscape, pausing intermittently to howl unconvincingly at the moon, and meet up at an abandoned logging site for a confrontation of great importance. The already unconvincing atmosphere instantly evaporates the second the wolves start talking, an act that comes off as completely bizarre. By the time wolf-Lautner yells “I am the grandson of a chief! I wasn’t born to follow you, or anyone else!” there is no doubt that the original ambitions of a mostly respectable movie have fallen apart.
Not all the fault can lie with the actors, of course. When sitting down to view cuts of the film, did various production members collapse in laughter themselves? How could they not? There’s something so sad yet undeniably magnetic about a movie that delivers unintentional hilarity with such dependable frequency.
In the end, “Breaking Dawn” has little to recommend it to non-fans of the Twilight franchise, but that’s almost beside the point. After all, given the helm of a literary and cinematic phenomenon, director Bill Condon had the freedom to create any end product without worrying about financial returns. The shamble that emerges is thus both a triumph and an abject failure—a film whose value and artistic merits largely depend upon who is watching.

Finding a balance between black comedy, philosophical musings, and high character drama is a challenge faced by every production of Neil LaBute’s multi-layered plays. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The Shape of Things,” directed by Allen J. MacLeod ’14, uses a stripped-down technical approach to help the talented cast shine. The show’s actor-focused attitude preserves LaBute’s witty, fast-paced banter while also allowing serious consideration of the ethical problems with “shaping” another human being, the play’s central thematic concern.
Tony J. Sterle ’11 is appropriately awkward in the role of Adam, the dorky but endearing protagonist who falls head over heels for an art student he meets while working as a guard at the art museum. The girl he falls for, Evelyn, is a dangerous and edgy artist played to perfection by Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12. Evelyn constantly decries the provincialism of their Midwest town and the locals’ lack of appreciation of “real art,” which in her mind takes the form of “graffiti penises” and a woman using her Tampax for finger painting. Her obsession with artistic achievement translates disturbingly into her treatment of new love interest Adam, whom she attempts to mold in a variety of increasingly drastic ways.
The audience watches as Adam turns from dud to stud, zero to hero, geek to chic—clichés that seem to adequately describe his metamorphosis from a shy, self-conscious dork into a confident and attractive man. At least, that is how it seems at first. It soon becomes apparent that these seemingly good changes are not as innocuous as they appear. Adam ditches his tweed blazer in favor of the “yachtsman line,” stops biting his nails, and loses 15 pounds, all the while dismissing these changes as “no big thing.” But when he agrees to go under the knife for a nose job while claiming to his friends that he fell, the extent of Evelyn’s influence becomes clear. As Evelyn’s controlling, possessive nature emerges, questions about the malleability of identity and the lengths that one can go to for love come to the fore.
The central duo of Sterle and Rossi carry the play, but John F. Morton ’15, playing Adam’s ex-roommate Phillip, and Leonie A. Oostrom ’15 as his fiancée Jenny ably assist them. Morton conveys Phillip’s amusingly stereotypical “douchiness”—at one point, Jenny calls him out for wearing sunglasses indoors—with panache, while Oostrom’s girl-next-door charm renders her character by far the most likeable of the bunch.
The cozy Adams Pool Theatre perfectly complements the intimate feel of the production. MacLeod’s minimalist style feels appropriate both to the space and to the play and strips  bare the compelling interactions between the characters. The production does suffer from poor lighting as well as slow, forced transitions between the scenes. But with the attention so firmly on the actors, their magnetic presence prevents these technical hitches from detracting significantly.
The play’s success is best seen in the gradual but ultimately heart-wrenching realization that Adam has lost much of what defined him as a person, a fact which he himself comes to realize in a beautifully crafted ending worthy of Agatha Christie. After an evening of laughter—albeit grim laughter—this production pulls the emotional rug from under the audience’s feet in consummate LaBute fashion, a fitting end to a gripping, brilliantly acted show.

“You will never see the world more clearly than you see it right now,” said acclaimed theater director Peter M. Sellars ’80 to an audience of undergraduates, professors, and others in the Harvard community as he sat among his collaborators—including composer John C. Adams ’69,  and librettist Alice A. Goodman ’80—to discuss the creation of the opera “Nixon in China.” “I love that artists have to find their own path here,” Sellars went on to say.
The proliferation of art at Harvard certainly leads to hard choices for artists between various media, publications, and academic pursuits. But as Goodman said, the main factor that changes an aspiring artist’s future is passion. “If this is the sort of thing you want to do,” she advised her audience, “you have to have the courage to do it.”
These and many other words of wisdom for young artists were shared on Tuesday, November 15 at the American Repertory Theater as part of Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebrations. All three speakers at the talk, moderated by University President Drew G. Faust, graduated from Harvard College and went on to collaborate on “Nixon in China,” a groundbreaking opera that just ended a revival season at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
“I was delighted at the prospect of bringing them here to do what they just did … which was to talk in such inspiring and powerful ways about the arts and what the arts mean in our world today, and how their lives as Harvard students turned into their lives as we now see them,” said Faust.
What Adams, Goodman, and Sellars set out to do in producing the opera was to change the way the world thought about preserving history. Too often, opera is perceived as an archaic art, too long and overwrought to be relevant to our culture today. “Telecast dead from the Met,” Sellars joked, but he claims that opera doesn’t have to be an art just for the elderly. The team took a risk in portraying the dramatic tale of Nixon’s visit to China in 1972 through opera, and they changed the face of the medium in the process.
‘Nixon in China’ premiered in 1987 at the Houston Grand Opera in Texas to a moderately enthused audience, but earlier this year, critics welcomed the unique piece to the Metropolitan Opera as an undoubted classic of American theater. The beauty of performance art is that it can be reborn in a time when the public is ready to reflect and accept a different spin on history. “The world manages to change enough to make the opera seem more relevant,” Adams said.
At one point, Faust asked what influence Harvard College specifically had on each performer’s career. Adams grinned, re-crossed his legs under his chair, and cocked his head to the side. “The most delicious irony was that we had our very first meeting in the Kennedy Center,” he said. Goodman mentioned that she and Sellars met in their freshman year, and Sellars talked about his participation in theater at Harvard. He said that one of the reasons he chose to come to Harvard was that Harvard does not have a theater major. “I regard theater departments as the death of theater in America,” Sellars said jokingly. But the freedom that students have here to create and to experiment is unique, and perhaps not having a theater department is a benefit in that respect—though there is now a Committee on Dramatic Arts.
Elaeanor T. Regan ’13, also a Crimson arts editor, was intrigued by the importance Sellars ascribed to undergraduate collaboration. “It’s interesting thinking about the fact that the friends we’re making here are the people whom we will collaborate with for the rest of our lives,” said Regan, a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club Board.
Certainly Adams, Goodman, and Sellars are excellent examples of undergraduate collaboration finding success in professional life. The supportive arts initiative on campus, spearheaded by Faust, is perhaps inspired by a similar attitude, providing opportunities for students to learn from artists in seminars and initiate creative, individual projects. “What you have at the moment is beyond precious,” said Sellars.

Austrian-born Gregor von Rezzori‘s 1966 autobiographical novel, “An Ermine in Czernopol,” has only been translated into English this year, but due to his relative obscurity, reviews will no doubt focus on the work’s context. The novel, which focuses on von Rezzori’s childhood in the titular city, located in the “godforsaken southeastern part of Europe,” will most likely be compared to Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum.” It may also garner comparisons to the work of Thomas Pynchon, an author who shares von Rezzori’s penchant for oddball characters, fragmented storylines, and cultural arcana.  Perhaps it will even be recognized as an antecedent to Hugo Claus’s 1983 work “The Sorrow of Belgium,” another novel about growing up in dramatic historical times.
Yet all of these comparisons would be somewhat misleading, because “An Ermine in Czernopol” is peculiar and unique. If novels were judged only by their evocation of place, it would surely rank as one of the finest ever written. It is a spectacular recreation of the world von Rezzori experienced as a youth. But it is little more than that: the work’s overwhelming focus on its setting, combined with a curious emotional distance, creates a book that functions less as a novel than as a travel guide to the city of Czernopol, complete with relevant historical anecdotes.
This pronounced emphasis on Czernopol itself is the work’s greatest strength as well as its worst weakness. When von Rezzori is simply describing the city, the novel works. Near the end of the book, he relates his impressions of the sounds of Czernopol. “The distant stamping of the musicians on the dance floors in the outlying districts,” he writes, “drifting on the wind, as they filled the tedious emptiness of a Sunday afternoon.” Here, as is often the case, his prose is fluid and confident. Yet in general, the novel’s descriptions of setting are maddeningly overwhelming, and all its other elements are there simply to serve the atmosphere. Certain characters are developed only so that von Rezzori can explain how they represent the spirit of Czernopol. The central narrative––the misadventures of a Hungarian military major named Nikolaus Tildy––is completely subjugated to setting; it has no broader significance except as an excuse for von Rezzori to rhapsodize about the city. Such unrelenting focus on the relationship between character and place eventually becomes tiresome.
These wearying aspects are compounded by the book’s distinctive narrative structure. As the epigraph, taken from the Greek text “Physiologus,” states, “the ermine will die should her coat become soiled,” and Tildy, the metaphorical ermine, shares that fatal sense of pride. His tribulations, which form the closest thing the novel has to a narrative arc, are set in motion by his challenging a native of Czernopol to a duel. At the same time, the reader is treated to numerous scenes taken from von Rezzori’s youth; some are seen through his eyes, and some are described to him by others. Long stretches of the novel are dedicated to the retelling of events by family friend and prefect Herr Tarangolian, von Rezzori’s tutor Herr Alexianu, and his uncle Sergei, among others.
Due to these disparate elements, the novel’s fragmented structure never comes together. Indeed, it can most accurately be described as a series of anecdotes. On one level, this is a sound choice: subjecting von Rezzori’s memories to a more conventional narrative structure would have detracted from the book’s documentarian project.  Yet on an individual level, the unconventional structure is misguided. This picaresque structure makes the relationships portrayed seem trivial, and creates emotional distance both from von Rezzori and from Czernopol. He repeatedly tells us that he greatly admires Tildy, but illustrates that by devoting a page to the major’s clothing.
Other elements of the book are even more confusing emotionally. For most of the novel, the narrator discusses little besides a bizarre fixation with Major Tildy. It comes as a surprise when, near the end of the novel, he turns to speaking about the women he finds attractive. He loves one “on account of her inner excruciating turmoil and the feminine tawdriness of her lost and faded elegance,” and another “because of her honey-colored eyes and the glory of her naked shoulders.” Such descriptions are well-crafted, if a little overwrought; still, they are typical of the novel’s emotional void.
The novel also suffers in numerous moments when von Rezzori is forced to pause the action and explain the intricacies of the situation. One scene featuring Tildy reads: “[he] found no other way to react... than to click his heels together so that his spurs gave a slight clink, ostensibly as a sign of polite respect, but one that showed the same provocatively dismissive mastery of military form for which he is all too well known.”
At certain points, these interjections lead to meaningful insights, but cumulatively they distract and annoy. Perhaps the book might have been more successful as a collection of short stories; the more frustrating elements of von Rezzori’s style might have been less evident that way. “The Ermine of Czernopol” may not succeed in its grandiose ambition to recreate individual consciousness, but nevertheless, it creates a powerful, arresting vision of Czernopol.

It seems incredible that a novella first published in 1999 by a Francophone Egyptian author––now three years deceased––might hold even more relevance in today’s political landscape than it did at the time of its own writing. It seems incredible, that is, that such a novel might capture the rampant corruption and government censorship in Egypt that spurred the nation’s uprisings in early 2011. But “The Color of Infamy,” Alyson Waters’s translation of acclaimed Egyptian ironist Albert Cossery’s eighth novel, does just that.
However, the real power of the novel lies not in the serendipitous relevance of its themes but in the sheer cynical joy it takes in expressing them. Rather than rallying, rebelling, and righting the wrong, the protagonists of Cossery’s novel mockingly reject the entire sociopolitical framework that allows the existence of widespread corruption. “The Colors of Infamy” recounts just one episode in the life of Ossama, a former student disillusioned with the power of knowledge who has settled comfortably into the life of a thief—“not a legitimate thief, such as a minister, banker, wheeler-dealer, speculator, or real-estate developer,” but a professional pickpocket who attires himself in a fine linen suit and suede shoes to escape the suspicion of the police.
On the job one day, Ossama manages to relieve the wealthy and corrupt real-estate developer Atef Suleyman—whose “physique [is] repugnant enough to disgust a nanny goat in heat”—of a letter implicating the shady brother of the Minister of Public Works in a recent housing scandal. The scandal arose when a public apartment complex built by Suleyman’s firm collapsed a mere three months after its unveiling, to the demise of 50 impoverished inhabitants inside. On finding the letter, Ossama feels he is “holding a bomb in his hands and he [does] not know how to explode it.” To find out how, he turns to his old master in thievery Nimr and notorious and pursued dissident journalist Karamallah, who has recently inhabited his family’s mausoleum to escape the attentions of “a pack of uneducated creditors … without leaving a forwarding address.”
Cossery’s narrative is interwoven with political commentary of a kind that might be distasteful were it not for his trenchant wit. His denouncements are sweetened by a cynical sense of humor. Thus the Egyptian government is not just a friend to censorship, it is “ferociously hostile to all information having any relationship whatsoever to the truth.” Theft is not only a profession to which the poor masses are driven in desperation, but “an activity that enjoy[s] international approval in proportion to the amount stolen.” The scandal at the focus of the narrative is itself absurd, especially when Suleyman tries to pass off the building collapse as the result of a selectively localized earthquake.
Nor does Cossery aim his wit exclusively at political targets. He has an eye for the subtleties of complex social interactions, and his treatment of a young girl’s unrequited love for Ossama is just as deliciously acerbic as the rest of his commentary. Safira’s situation is just as tragic as many others’: she is a painfully naïve, destitute 17-year-old girl who tries to support herself and her mother by becoming a prostitute. None of this, of course, keeps Ossama from being irritated by her clingy attention. Her sudden appearance beside his table is a cause for panic about the ensuing “pointless, poignant conversation detrimental to his optimism.” Her contrived surprise at finding him there leads him to suspect she’s tracked him through every road of the city. This is not to say the thief is entirely heartless; Cossery portrays a man torn between a sense of responsibility for the girl, frustration with her bumbling innocence, and annoyance at the timing of the whole encounter. It is ultimately Ossama’s complexity that makes him relatable; in a later scene he inadvertently betrays his concern for his blind and delusional father, who lives in a symbolically crumbling apartment. But in his inner candor—exemplified by his admission that Safira’s unrequited love is little more than an inconvenient and awkward distraction—Ossama also establishes himself as the comic star of Cossery’s novel.
But Cossery’s humor is more than just comic relief from the descriptions of Cairo’s destitution. Humor offers the only true escape from a world sagging under the weight of governmental greed. The self-important sobriety of those who try to formulate deep or academic pronouncements on the state of the nation is rejected as entirely impotent. He labels philosophers “inveterate scoffers … who believed that the city’s spectacular deterioration had been expressly created to hone their critical faculties.” Any academic pursuit is rejected by the wiser cynics of the tale as “a sure road to slavery.” Cossery is a kind of Jon Stewart of Francophone literature, an author who sees levity and irony as necessary prerequisites for sanity in a myopic political climate. According to Ossama, “nothing on this earth is tragic for an intelligent man,” and one can’t help but feel that Cossery feels exactly the same way.

Arthur M. Shepherd doesn’t spend much time at home, which for him is an RV parked behind South Station. Most days, the middle-aged man drags his acoustic guitar and a plastic folding chair into Boston’s Dewey Square to serenade Occupiers and visitors with tunes like the Beatles’ “Can’t Buy Me Love.” He’s become a fixture at least as permanent as the tarps blanketing the plaza since early October. “I don’t consider it performing,” says Shepherd. “I’m just playing songs.”
Shepherd took some music classes in college, though he was a philosophy major. He enrolled in graduate school for social work—to make his mother happy, he says—and stopped playing music for 10 years. “I should’ve been sent to hell right then and there for that decision,” he says. But he’s gotten back into it over the past year or so. Today, it’s a way for him to be involved in the Occupy movement, which he sees as a “product of tyranny” that will remain until “economic equilibrium is restored.”
For Shepherd’s form of street performance, there’s one big problem: it’s getting cold in the Northeast. The freak snowstorm around Halloween was a dismal portent for many protesters, 10 of whom was hospitalized for hypothermia in New York. According to Occupy Boston’s website, there was supposed to be a winterizing meeting on Sunday, November 13, at 2 p.m. It never materialized. Volunteers asked about it weren’t sure what to say. Shepherd isn’t facing hypothermia, but he is nervous about the difficulty of playing a string instrument in the bitter cold.
This predicament is natural. Throughout Boston—in parks, around plazas, aside the turnstile at the T—street performers wage a daily contest between themselves and their surroundings. Accidents in weather are only one unknown variable that street artists must confront. They are captives to circumstance, most obviously an early snowfall or sudden downpour, but more critically a police rebuke or an indifferent audience. In fact, circumstance is part and parcel of street performance. Rather than escaping random contingencies, the artists must instead work within them. They must work with the limitations of their stage in order to complete a successful show.
AUDIENCE YAKKING
An hour or two later on November 13, six blocks down Congress Street and a little to the west, other acts begin and other audiences take shape. Boston’s Faneuil Hall, a historic meeting hall and marketplace near the waterfront, hosts in an outdoor square a continual rotation of artists, from juggler Giles the Jester to the Eric Royer One Man Band. Jermaine R. Carter is a drummer of the pots-and-pans type, and a regular. A small group has formed around him and his set one Sunday afternoon, on the downtown side of the building, before a policeman approaches. He whispers in Carter’s ear and points behind Carter at a spray-painted red line that circles the building. The zoning laws have changed: performers hosted by Faneuil Hall must remain within a few meters of its walls. By the time Carter moves everything behind the line, the audience has dispersed. It takes a few minutes before others slowly regather.
Carter’s music depends on the venue.  When he’s booked for shows, he has a routine he usually follows. “But here I kind of freelance,” he says, contrasting such shows to his street performances, “so I can do what I want.”
As in other careers, most street performers are part of a network of fellow professionals—a social aspect often lost, perhaps, in the mythic idea of the solitary musician, his open case bathed in moonlight and strewn with quarters. “There’s a whole group of us in the city,” says Carter. “Some of us mingle with each other, some of us don’t.” As he packs up his set, he mentions that he’s about to join up with another drummer. “I kind of showed him the ropes out here,” he adds.
Though Carter is originally from Boston, the job lends itself to an itinerant lifestyle. “When it’s cold,” he says, “I’ll probably be in a tropical climate.” If not, he goes to Miami, or, if he’s lucky, out West. If necessary, he’ll stay in Boston and busk on the warmer days.
Around the corner, the ambiance is a bit different. The You Already Know (YAK) breakdancers tell a similar story about seasonal performance. They’ll go to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, or Miami when the Northeast climate becomes too hostile, according to bandleader Universal L. Fair (according to Fair, not a stage name). Here by Quincy Market, the show is self-consciously slicker, more polished, than Carter’s. Maroon 5’s “Moves Like Jagger” blasts from a stereo as the dancers spin and flip. They continually hound the audience to cheer on, yell out, and at one point join in. The crowd is larger than anywhere else by Faneuil Hall, and lingers longer; this is a show, unlike others here, with a definite beginning and end. For a breakdancing troupe, this setup makes sense. To the music, the sole or at least main event in a drum performance, these dancers add visual effects and a prearranged script. This degree of preplanned speech and sensory spectacle means that YAK’s art is as much dance as theater.
“It’s a mix of breakdancing, gymnastics, and acrobatics,” says Fair by way of describing the routine. According to Fair, YAK is currently in its third incarnation; the first generation of dancers started in 1974 or 1975. The training is strenuous, and especially difficult without access to a gym.
However, Fair is dismissive of indoor breakdancing, which he says is “basically like studio dancing.” For Fair, indoor breakdancing is a lesser offshoot of street performance. “They call this [outdoor] type of style freak dancing, and [they] hate it,” he says, “but they don’t even have the right to do that because breakdancing started in the street.” It is not clear that Fair objects to the existence of professionalized indoor breakdancing per se, but rather to its air of condescension, its disdain for street breakdancing as a cruder, less sophisticated art. Fair considers this conception unwarranted: “Everybody learned off of us—that’s the whole thing.”
REBELLION DANCE
Breakdancing is intelligible only when considered in terms of its geographical and formal constraits, and its history in the underground and then in mass culture. For traditional breakdancing, the stage is the sidewalk and pay is dispensed from voluntary audience members into a makeshift collection box. The form’s associations with youth and freedom and urban culture have lent it a rebellious tone since the 1970s. “Hip-hop has become an international vocabulary for young people to express themselves,” said nationally acclaimed author and critic Nelson George in a 2008 interview with web-based knowledge forum Big Think. “And particularly to express their rebellion.” But rebellion is a difficult note to sustain for over 40 years. As breakdancing has crept into mainstream culture, tensions have arisen between its roots and its appropriations. Contemporary breakdancing can still be distinguished from other types of hip-hop dance in its embrace of freestyle over choreography, but in moving away from the street breakdancing has complicated the traditional relationship between space and performer, and performer and audience. As with any street performance, the breakdancer can take advantage of (or be hampered by) the entropy of daily life, which, welcomed or dismissed, shapes every performance into a unique, improvised whole.
Such a space allows the performer to establish a rapport with those watching—however briefly—that destabilizes the barrier between professionals and spectators. On the other hand, the audience can often be quite willing to maintain such a divide. It’s impossible to predict whether an audience will enjoy detached observation or interaction with the performers.
So striking the ideal balance between street performance and conventional dance—a decidedly dynamic but uncertain endeavor—is the crucial struggle for breakdancers.
TOPROCK AND FLOATS
“Hip-hop culture has four original elements,” says Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dance Instructor at Harvard Henry Kasdon. “Breaking,” a bygone term for breakdancing like “b-boy” or “b-girl,” was only one of them; Kasdon’s other three are DJing, rap, and graffiti. Hip-hop culture has its roots in the Bronx of the late 1960s, as a fusion of 1930s “lindy hop,” a form of swing dancing, plus the Afro-Brazilian dance moves of capoeira. Hip-hop became a scene by the early 1970s, according to Kasdon, when “DJs would throw these block parties in the Bronx,” isolating “breaks,” that is, specific sections of a song, and playing them on repeat to allow for a greater exploration of rhythm and beat.
Ultimately it would join forces with a similar strain gaining steam on the West Coast, a funk-infused dance called electric boogaloo, and the combination of the two included such classic breakdance moves as “popping”—quickly contracting and releasing muscles in rhythm with a song; and “locking”—moving in rapid rhythm to a beat and then freezing in a certain position. A vocabulary specific to b-boying began to emerge as the result of the dance’s novelty. “Downrock”—any move on the floor—includes “floats,” in which the dancer supports his weight on his hands to appear as if floating, perhaps beginning to “tap,” or push himself around until able to freely spin. “Toprock”—footwork performed upright—also allowed time for popping and locking.
By the mid-1980s, the media had begun to latch onto the novel potential of hip-hop. The same DJs who had hosted block parties in the Bronx began to appear at clubs in Manhattan. B-boys dancing on the street were hired by L.A. production companies and fashioned into pop-culture sensations. This was the era of movies like “Flashdance,” “Wild Style,” “Breakin’,” and its sequel “Breakin’ 2.” The 1984 New York Times review of “Breakin’” dubbed it a solid portrayal of “break-dancing, the energetic street choreography that is now in the process of being co-opted and merchandized by big-time show business.”
There’s a moment in the movie after the three main characters begin their breakdance routine in front of a cast of stodgy old judges at a dance competition. At first the judges are skeptical, disapproving; they try to dissuade street dancer Ozone from beginning, even though breakdancing isn’t expressly forbidden in the competition. He doesn’t listen and begins. Then an eyebrow is raised, glances exchanged, and slowly the judges are enchanted, much to the dismay of the conventional group preceding: “This is nonsense,” says Franco, a professional dance instructor; “Go away, I can’t see,” responds a judge, shooing him aside. It’s a scene that relies heavily on tired cliché, but it suggests that breakdancing represents the vital future of dance.
More important for the visibility of breakdancing than the scene itself is the fact that a big-budget Hollywood film would be talking about the form at all. Breakdancing became appropriated by mass culture. It was considered a more wholesome alternative to “gangsta rap,” or perhaps a backlash against this other, coarser heir to hip-hop. By the turn of the millennium breakdancing had begun to be employed in commercials and music videos. Stars like Paula Abdul melded it with R&B and pop-friendly rhythms in their performances, drawing on Michael Jackson’s incorporation of breakdance moves beginning in the 1980s.
Yet in another sense, breakdancing began to diverge from other forms of hip-hop culture. In a 2009 Boston Globe article, Adam Mansbach, a writer and founding editor of the 1990s hip-hop journal Elementary, traced the genealogy of hip-hop: “Graffiti exploded onto the gallery scene in the early ’80s; rap records were selling millions of copies by 1979,” he writes.  B-boying, on the other hand, was a process instead of a product, so it was more difficult to package. As a result, it became “the kinetic counterpart to the soundscape of rap music and the visuals of graffiti art.”
The media appropriation had perhaps more to do with the music upon which breakdancing was grounded than with the rubric of its moves. Today insiders are quick to draw a distinction between all forms of dance set to hip-hop music and specifically breakdancing, which need not be set to hip-hop music. Despite their common source, and despite continuing overlap, to some they encompass entirely different attitudes and approaches, a difference framed by improvisation versus choreography.
NIMBLE COMRPOMISES
Y. John Mei ’12 is the first to arrive to a recent Harvard Breakers session. Music from the pulsing stereo echoes across Currier Dance Studio as Mei attempts an upside-down downrock. He’s been breakdancing since his final semester at high school, but has been watching the moves on YouTube for much longer. The Breakers have two types of practices, he says, session and rehearsal, depending on whether they’re preparing for a performance or just want to improve. “Everybody trains differently,” he says. “That’s the really great part about this.”
Outreach Chair Brian W. Yang ’13 says that the Breakers has between 25 and 30 active members, around 10 of whom will show up to an average practice. By 9:45 p.m. at this 9:00 p.m. session, there are eight or nine undergraduates. He points past a kid in a green bandanna spinning around on his head, to another student warming up with a friend, and says,  “I’ve never seen the girl in black before.”
Yang explains that for breakdancing in general, and popping—his own forte—in particular, there are a few basics, a core, upon which you build variations. He sees awareness and control of his own body as the key to success, a tool salvaged from his days playing football and running track in high school.
Yang sees this self-awareness and self-control as necessary to successful performance. “Breakers is very freestyle-oriented,” he says. As its original form, street dance continues to influence even more domesticated kinds of breakdancing. “We really feed off the crowd,” says Yang, contrasting Breakers performances with ballet recitals, in which applause is muted and restrained until the end.
Even the indoor version of breakdancing relies on the accidents of audience appreciation like its outdoor counterpart. There is therefore quite a bit of overlap between the Harvard Breakers and their broader hip-hop counterpart, Expressions Dance Company. It’s not uncommon for students to participate in both, though there can be tension when students leave one to join the other. Each group has a subtly different conception on the way breakdancing should look when performed in a proper theater.
Darcie M. Dieman ’12, who at one point was involved in both organizations, emphasizes that while breakdancing can sometimes be choreographed, “there’s a huge emphasis on freestyle.” Expressions, on the other hand, is always choreographed. It relies less on the vocabulary of the moves and more on the grammar of the dance, demanding an airtight conformity of the music to the movements. Though it also connects the background beat with the form of dance, breakdancing is more about “power moves and flips and foot work,” says Dieman. Breakdancing should transition seamlessly between skill and style, but pauses and abberations are more welcome in the Breakers.
It’s this fluidity that expresses the Breakers’ fidelity to the conventions of breakdancing. Jams might take place indoors, but, according to Dieman, “breakdancing is always going to hold on to that street feel,” even if “it’s not street—but it’s also not stage.” Rather than inheriting both the limitations of the street and the limitations of the stage, the best breakdancers move nimbly between the two. They include the audience to the extent that they encourage cheers and applause during the show, a contrast between the Breakers performance and a Harvard Ballet Company concert. That the Breakers also incorporate choreography gives their moves a more refined sheen of artistic skill, and allows the dancers to put on a theatrical show like YAK’s at Faneuil Hall.
This impure improvisation is a small departure from the heritage of breakdancing as a street art, in which the rebellion of youth culture was embodied by spontaneity. This fusion of two distinct forms inevitably proves irritating to some, who would prefer to characterize breakdancing as unadulterated by either the crudeness of the street or the staid orderliness of conventional dance. But breakdancing is messier than that. Its ability to cobble together distinct forms and strategies without becoming prescribed or systematic in its approach suggests its continued vitality as a form.

November 29-December 3, 8 p.m., December 3, 2 p.m.
Loeb Mainstage
Directed by Charlotte H. Alter ’12
Music directed by Will D. Ramsey ’12
Produced by Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13, Vaida Rimeikyte ’13 and Anne K. Sawyier ’12
“The goal of the show is to raise the standards for Harvard theater,” says director Charlotte H. Alter ’12 about the upcoming Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” the Howard Ashman and Alan Menken 1982 rock musical.
“Little Shop of Horrors” follows Seymour Krelborn (Matthew J. DaSilva ’12), a poor young florist who obtains a mysterious plant with a sinister taste for blood. The plant grows to enormous proportions and brings fame and business to the shop, but Seymour only wants the love of his coworker Audrey (Yasmeen E. Audi ’15), who is in a relationship with a sadistic dentist (Steven D. Bombino ’12). Seymour soon discovers that his plant (voiced by Jonathan P. Finn-Gamino ’12) can talk, and it offers to make all Seymour’s dreams come true—at a price.
This production will attempt to toe the line between the source material’s ridiculous, lighthearted aspects and dark, twisted plot progression without deviating into camp. “I think the dark comedy is one of the things that makes it appealing to audiences, and we’re trying to keep it there but also create a world that is believable,” says Alter. “I think what’s funny is such a fantastical element coming into a world that seems like it could actually exist.” The actors are also insistent that they are not creating caricatures. “The most interesting thing about this character is if you can give him depth,” says Bombino about his role as the villainous dentist. “At the end of the day we want him to be a mostly likeable character, especially when you first see him.”
The production also aims to be technically resourceful. Alter’s approach was “to go to people in the Harvard community that we know have skills in this area, but not necessarily go through the usual HRDC channels to find them.” As a result, many technical roles are occupied by people who have never been involed in theater. “I feel like we have one of the best staffs of any show on this campus so far,” says producer Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13.
The unusual staff had plenty of work to do, thanks to a last-minute switch of venues from the Loeb Experimental Theater to the Mainstage. This will be the first musical there since “Into the Woods” in 2010. “From there it’s really been sort of taking this show that we conceived on this very small intimate scale and blowing it up times a billion to fill the space,” says Batista-Pereira.

Emily B. Hyman ’13, a Crimson Magazine editor, is a literature concentrator and a resident of Currier House. She has been in 11 productions with the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) to date. She has played a wide range of roles in both comedies and tragedies, and will also act in “Little Shop of Horrors,” an upcoming musical. She has produced several student-run plays, including HRDC’s “Play It Again, Sam,” a comedy that ran in the Adams Pool Theatre this October.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you start getting involved in theater?
Emily B. Hyman: At Harvard, I started my freshman fall. I was in a show called “The Flies”—I was a townswoman and had about four lines, but it was great. Before Harvard, we had to do this big Shakespeare production in eighth grade, and that’s when I fell in love with theater. I did productions throughout high school—I went to an all-girls’ school, so it was a good way to meet people in my town outside of school.
THC: Which have been your favorite productions at Harvard?
EBH: I’ve gotten such different things out of almost everything I’ve done, and they’ve all been such different challenges, so I’ve been really lucky in that aspect. Another big aspect is whom I’ve gotten to know through theater—actors, student producers, and a few older directors. I think that I’ve grown the most in the student-directed productions, though.
THC: Which of those productions were you in this fall semester?
EBH: I was in three productions this fall: “Crave,” “Othello,” and now “Little Shop of Horrors.” “Little Shop of Horrors” is my first musical, so I’m really nervous. I have a singing part, which is really different because I usually just stick to straight plays.
THC: What are the types of roles you like to play?
EBH: It depends; I’ve been really lucky in that I’ve gotten a pretty big variety of roles. I love doing comedies, but I sort of took a very intense break from that this past year. I’ve been doing a lot of more serious stuff, which I love as well, and I learned a lot from that and feel really lucky that I was able to play those roles.
THC: What’s the difference, in your opinion, between acting in a comedy and a drama?
EBH: Comedy is all about the timing, while drama is a little more relaxed. Comedy is really hard in that way. You have to really be conscientious about how and when jokes land. It’s an art.
THC: Do you think that there is a specific group of Harvard students who identify with theater and frequently do theater productions together?
EBH: There certainly is a group who do HRDC productions, and I’ve been really lucky to know a huge group of people involved in Harvard theater; they’re all really wonderful, and I’m happy to work with them. It’s my hope that more than just those people see our plays because I fear that the theater community is lesser known among the larger Harvard community. In my world, theater feels really big, but I feel that other people I know who aren’t involved in productions don’t usually know what’s going on. It’s a problem that I hope we can one day fix.
THC: Considering that you’ve acted in so many productions, would you ever try playwriting?
EBH: I have never written a play, but maybe if I had a good idea. I think that to write a play you have to have something you’re really passionate about that you want to write about. Right now, I don’t think I have that yet.
THC: Do you think after you graduate you will continue on with acting?
EBH: That’s a loaded question. I would love to say “yes,” but it’s a very scary idea. I’m just thinking about next semester, and right now I don’t really know what I want to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College can be a difficult and stressful time, and sometimes it’s hard to remember to thank those who help us along the way. This past Thursday night, however, one undergrad at Berklee College of Music took the stage to express his gratitude to those who have aided him on his path to success. Surrounded by his friends—the backup singers and the band—Jonathan A. Rostamabadi sang 12 songs in his concert, “Miles to Go Before I Sleep.” The songs were quite varied, ranging from deep and soulful R&B to upbeat and fun country selections.
The title “Miles to Go Before I Sleep” comes from a quote in Robert Frost’s poem “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening.” The poem is relevant to Rostamabadi’s own experiences as he recently took time off of school after feeling overwhelmed. “The time off reaffirmed my love and passion for music, allowed me to recharge my creativity, and helped remind me why I came to Berklee nine semesters ago,” he wrote in his note to the audience. Rostamabadi took time to reevaluate his goals for the future and returned to Berklee reenergized and refocused. He then decided to create a concert out of appreciation. “This started out with an idea to have a fun blowout concert that incorporated all of my friends that helped me out in my years here.”
His friends, Kristen M. McCullough and Leah S. Washington, recently graduated Berklee students, were happy to support him in his endeavor. “We’re close friends … he asked me to help, so I arranged the rhythm section and brass,” said McCullough. Washington plays the flute and attended 9 a.m. practices for three weeks leading up to the final performance. At Berklee, it’s typical to help a friend out with a concert or performance. Rostamabadi and his friends practiced in the early mornings and all of the performers helped as a favor to him. Ultimately, he can use this concert as an academic requirement, but the initial purpose was simply to have fun, and his many friends spent a lot of time and effort helping him to make it a success. Their communal passion for music added an element of camaraderie and excitement to the performance. All of people on the stage shared the same desire to create beautiful music, either with their voices, strings, or horns.
The innovative arrangement of the music also played an important role in the performance. McCullough helped arrange some of the pieces, as many of the songs were only written for a rhythm section. The band was made up of violins, a cello, guitars, a bass, trumpets, saxophones, a trombone, a flute, and a piano. McCullough, along with Rostamabadi, Cam Moncur, Deborah Pierre, and Washington, helped arrange the music for the extra instruments.
This big band atmosphere is what inspired Rostamabadi to include so many instruments in the final product. “I always had this dream to have my own small orchestra, sort of à la Harry Connick, Jr. … How many different ways can I arrange something that’s only written for piano, bass, and drums?”
Rostamabadi included lighthearted songs like “I Don’t Want to Be” by Gavin DeGraw and “Lucky” by Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat and arranged both songs to be simple and clear. However, he also included more complex and intense songs such as “A House is Not a Home,” by Dionne Warwick as both a tribute to old-style R&B and to showcase his voice in a different type of music. He also included a country song titled “Tattoos on This Town” by Jason Aldean as his final number. “When I sit down and pick songs, I always ask my friends what songs they like, especially if they’re in the concert. I like to get their opinions because I always think it’s important that your band enjoys the music as well,” Rostamabadi said. In fact, the song “Only You” by Josh Kelley was introduced to him by one of his backup singers.  “I tried to pick songs that show my versatility as a singer and that have something unique about them that you wouldn’t necessarily always see going to a standard concert.”
Ultimately, however, the concert was for Rostamabadi to thank all of his supporters and friends. He dedicated the song “One More Tomorrow” by Eric Benét to all of those who have helped him get this far in his career. “This is my thank you song,” he said. “If you have someone you love—think about them. If you didn’t have one more day with them, could you go on?”

“I like flirting with things that seem dangerous,” artist Alexis Rockman jokingly shared with the audience as he explained his fascination with painting the effects of climate change and ecological disasters. Rockman, along with James J. McCarthy, Alexander Agassiz Professor of Biological Oceanography, and Susan Dackerman, Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Curator of Prints in the division of European and American art at the Harvard Art Museums, spoke in a lecture entitled “Artistic Visions and Scientific Truths.” The lecture, which took place this Wednesday night at the Boston Museum of Science, was part of the ongoing series “When Science Meets Art,” which supports discussion about how art can convey messages of science to people in a more striking manner.
“Artistic Visions and Scientific Truths”—a collaboration between the Harvard Art Museums and the Boston Museum of Science—stemmed from the ongoing exhibition “Prints and Pursuits of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe” at the Sackler Museum. According to Dackerman, the exhibition examines the intricate relationship between art and scientific investigations in the 16th century. “What I was interested in examining,” said Dackerman, “was the exchanges that happened between artists and scientists and the representative skills artists had contributed to projects that were under development.” As she examined Dutch printmaker Jan Saenredam’s print of a beached whale, she drew attention to the intricate ways in which people assessed the whale. “What the artist is doing for us and viewers ... is translating the data collected and presenting it to us in a form that is visually comprehensible to a non-specialist audience,” Dackerman said.
Rockman agreed, citing naturalist artists Charles R. Knight and Chesley Bonestell as some of his main influences. These painters were, according to Rockman, “my heroes as a child, and [the] people I look up to,” and partly inspired him to become an artist who focused his career on exploring the consequences of science such deforestation and climate change. This examination of the effects of science was clearly manifest in one of his paintings, “Mount Rushmore,” which depicts apocalyptically rising ocean levels. McCarthy praised the painting for its shock element that provoked thought. “This image is gripping,” he remarked. “I think an image like this conveys something no table, no graph, no hour-long lecture on the thermal expansion of the ocean and what is happening with melting ice could possibly do.” Rockman’s artwork has garnered much attention; his paintings having been exhibited in a wide range of museums including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.
McCarthy further elaborated on the ability of art to communicate messages in a visceral, powerful manner that scientists, thus far, have unable to achieve. Scientists, according to him, have a tendency to underplay their predictions and data findings. “If a scientist were to overstate ... that person will acquire a reputation as someone who over-reads data [and] exaggerates interpretation ... and this casts a doubt on anything and everything they say,” he explained. On the other hand, artists can be more hyperbolic without the having to put their reputations at risk. As Rockman mentioned, he and other artists can “[use] the authority of scientific pictorialism to walk a fine line between fact and fiction.”
However, Rockman did caution against giving art too much credit in advocating environmental and ecological awareness. “I’ve looked at all the civil rights activist traditions as role models and see the ecological movement as a pathetic disaster. There is no one charismatic enough [in the movement],” he said. “The ecological movement needs a charismatic leader to mobilize many people.”
The lecture was filled with thought-provoking ideas exploring the unity of art and science. Audience member Hilary C. Farlow discussed the dynamic relationship presented. “It was very interesting to have an artist … and a scientist … talk about how similar their fields are, and the overlaps between them,” she remarked at the end of the lecture. “It is interesting to see how art can almost get away with pushing the envelope more than science,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Making sense of Roberto Bolaño’s life and sprawling literary history has come to require something akin to detective work. “By Night In Chile,” originally published in 2000, was translated by Chris Andrews and released to the English-speaking public in 2003—the same year that Bolaño died at age 50 from liver failure—and it was this work and the event of his death that introduced this heir of the Latin American greats like Gabriel García Márquez and Jorge Luis Borges to English readers. Since then, several more of his works have been translated into English, and more papers are still being found among his estate. Bolaño already exists in the world in full, though perhaps aspects are still unfound, and readers must put the pieces together from what has been given after the fact. It is thus haunting and eerie—even verging on the prophetic—that puzzles and detective work figure so largely Bolaño’s oeuvre.
“The Third Reich” was written by Bolaño in 1989 but was not published at the time. The manuscript was found posthumously, and was serialized earlier this year by The Paris Review in a translation by Natasha Wimmer. The work bears all the characteristics that will later come to full fruition in his long-form masterpieces “Savage Detectives” and “2666.” Idiosyncratic formal elements, like hand-drawn diagrams and a first-person journal structure, as well as thematic elements of violence and anxiety, can be seen here. Yet it would be reductive of “The Third Reich” to view it simply as an addendum to the established Bolaño or as an extraneous detail. “The Third Reich,” itself exhibiting elements of the detective genre, should be viewed through the lens of a master detective: every sign is indicative of a narrative, and every detail further complicates the layers of complexity already present.
“The Third Reich” is the journal Udo Berger begins to keep from August 20, when he goes on vacation to Spain from Germany with his girlfriend Ingeborg. He is the German champion of the titular war game, and has garnered modest attention as an essayist and strategist on these types of games. He comes on his first vacation with his new, beautiful girlfriend to a beach town in a hotel where he stayed with his parents when he was a child. His plan is to finalize his strategy for an important article he needs to complete by the end of the summer. Starting with the setting itself, Bolaño begins to juxtapose binaries—starting with the simple mix of work and play Udo plans to achieve—a device he continues to use to strange and devastating effect throughout the novel.
The concept of a war game lends itself easily to such a trope. In the game called “The Third Reich,” players take on the roles of countries involved in World War II and use strategies often divergent from history to arrive at different results from what we know to have conspired. Having a game based on the most devastating event in world history is unexpected enough; another inversion takes place in that most players of this game take it very seriously, becoming involved in clubs, going to conventions to discuss papers, and publishing “scholarly” magazines. Play becomes work, and work becomes play. The result is a constant revision: on the level of the game, history is being retold and reformulated, and in a wider sense, boundaries between categories and concepts are becoming blurred while symbols take on completely different meanings from their original ones.
One of such upturned details is the book that Ingeborg reads throughout her vacation. It’s a “Florian Linden detective novel,” and Udo claims to have figured out who the murderer is from the beginning, despite only having leafed through pages. Ingeborg, curiously, does not seem interested or invested in the mystery, and even leaves the book behind when she goes back to Germany at the end of the summer. At first, Udo’s mention of the novel seems to be a mere device for him to be able to comment on his girlfriend’s fickle, carefree nature, but as the novel progresses, this small aspect of his life takes on sinister dimensions. In the September 6 entry, Udo writes, “Why, I don’t know, maybe because it was the nearest thing to me, I picked up the Florian Linden book and opened it at random. ‘The Killer is the owner of the hotel.’ ‘Are you sure?’ I closed the book.”
The seemingly disparate elements in “The Third Reich” undergo this type of transformation on their own terms. By the end of the novel, it is clear that despite Udo’s lack of reliability as a narrator, everything he has chronicled so far has come together, as if in a conspiracy, each event building irrevocably and irreversibly to a predetermined end. As in a strategy game, it is in looking back that Udo and the reader can pinpoint the decisive moment that led to the conclusion. Thus “The Third Reich,” yet another gift given to the literary world by Bolaño from the grave, is the perfect war game. The table is set, and the very first moves may well determine the entire play—but Bolaño is a worthy opponent, and his strategy will only be understood when it’s too late.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, after weeks of negotiations, Harvard’s janitors voted overwhelmingly to ratify the contract agreement negotiated with the University.
Their new contract includes language that will give employees who work at Harvard but are indirectly hired access to the same benefits enjoyed by directly hired employees, including child care programs and a Tuition Assistance Program. It also includes promises to move more janitors to full-time work and eliminate split shifts, as well as janitor wage raises of up to three percent a year, according to a press release by the Service Employees International Union Local 615.
We are happy that the janitors negotiated such an excellent contract. Harvard should treat its employees well, and full-time work, contiguous shifts, and equal benefits for directly-hired and contracted employees are important aspects to ensuring that Harvard’s jobs remain good jobs.
We hope that this contract sets a precedent for positive relations between the union and the University in future contracts and influences the University to apply similarly high standards for its other employees. Harvard’s labor practices continue to set a high standard in the city and state. Hopefully, this excellent contract will influence other employers, like the other universities nearby, to also guarantee their employees similarly favorable terms of employment.
SEIU Local 615 has repeatedly emphasized the connection of this contract campaign to the Occupy movement. In a press release immediately following a tentative settlement on Tuesday night, the union called the new contract “a victory for Harvard janitors and the 99 percent.” The union’s press release after the ratification vote explicitly thanked the students of Occupy Harvard for their support in the campaign. Indeed, Occupy Harvard publically expressed its support for a fair contract, and some of the students and staff involved with Occupy Harvard appeared at rallies and marches with custodians demanding a fair contract with the University.
We cannot be sure exactly how much effect Occupy Harvard’s involvement in the negotiations actually had. Although the goal of supporting workers is noble, the administration has not released any information about whether the presence of a dozen tents in Harvard Yard actually influenced contract negotiations. Despite this uncertainty, Occupy Harvard’s dedication to workers’ rights on campus is admirable. We disagree with the movement’s tactic of holding the Yard hostage, as it is a working and living place for thousands of students and a symbol of the institution’s openness to the outside world. However, the idea of fighting for higher janitorial wages is an example of proper and appropriate student activism. Harvard has a long history of student-worker action: In fact, this contract comes on the ten-year anniversary of the 2001 Living Wage campaign, which secured a living wage for all Harvard workers after a three-week occupation of Massachusetts Hall and pitching tents in Harvard Yard. Engaging with the University’s labor practices in a directed manner is a praiseworthy and useful form of activist engagement.
On the other hand, student political participation can lose legitimacy when it takes on too much. This is what the Occupy Harvard movement has done. By attempting to link local and global issues, Occupy Harvard has earned the credulity of the student body. Discussing the custodians’ contract in the context of the global Occupy movement seems misguided.
Supporting janitors is an admirable and praiseworthy cause. However, now that the janitors have won a good contract, we see little reason for Occupy Harvard to remain in Harvard Yard. It is time for the movement to cease their inappropriate and ineffective tactic of maintaining tents in the middle of Harvard’s campus. The Yard has been closed to non-ID holders for almost two weeks, and the administration has given no sign that it will open the gates before Occupy Harvard dismantles its camp. With the contract settled, it is absurd for student protestors to continue to hold the Yard hostage without concrete or achievable goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bringing Malthus’ pessimistic view of humanity into the twenty-first century, perhaps it was fitting for Nicholas D. Kristof ’81, the United Nations Population Fund, and other population control advocates that the world population surpassed seven billion on Halloween. Time called the birth of the seven billionth child not joyful but “sobering.” Kristof went further, blaming population for everything from “climate change to poverty to civil wars.” Clearly, according to those afraid of overpopulation, people are too expensive.
The foundation of the overpopulation argument is that people are a plague upon the Earth, harming the planet and themselves. Everything from poverty to terrorism is the result of “youth bulges” and “booming populations.” To solve the growing problem of overpopulation, Kristof and his allies argue for “the birth control solution” and ensuring “the protection of reproductive rights.” The United Nations even went so far as to pressure Ireland and nations around the world to legalize abortion as a “human right.” The right to life, it seems, no longer applies when babies threaten the world.
When the “solution to many of the global problems that confront us” is to reduce the number of people on the planet, the assumption is that population is the major cause of global problems. If one accepts the overpopulation argument, however, babies and unborn children are far from the worst threat to the planet. The majority of world population growth comes from the increased life expectancy of the world population, yet population control advocates do not support the end of medical research or medicine. However, the critical assumption behind their argument—that humanity is the problem—leaves them without the principles with which to defend human life from genocide and murder. When deer are overpopulated, people hunt them, yet Kristof would most likely not endorse hunting people to eliminate what he believes is the cause of so many problems. His overpopulation argument, however, would. There is something intrinsically sacred and good about human life that requires humanity to respect it. When the belief that all human life is good is removed, how does one distinguish between who should live and who should not when reducing the world’s population?
For a different perspective, look no further than Anne Frank. Writing with only a trick bookshelf separating her from near certain death, she still found time to remind the world why the human person was good, “Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you don’t know how great you can be! How much you can love! What you can accomplish! And what your potential is!” All people are capable of great things. Kristof and all others who blame the world’s problems on overpopulation failed to celebrate the death of Steve Jobs or Mother Theresa, most likely because of their contributions to the world. Perhaps they could exercise some humility and recognize the potential and beauty that lies within each human person, born and unborn. As reported by Thomas L. Friedman, Prem K. Kalra is doing just that. In India, where 75 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day, he created an affordable tablet computer to empower the poorest person in the nation. With the computer, millions of students will have access to an education and the tools to escape poverty. Instead of blaming poverty on people, he sought a way use the human potential of each person not only to end poverty but also to create prosperity.
In his last, everlasting words, Ronald Reagan’s tomb was inscribed with the promise of human life, “I know in my heart that man is good, that what is right will always eventually triumph, and there is purpose and worth to each and every life.” Conservative ideas recognize the intrinsic value of man, and the great potential that he holds within himself. To help mankind and solve the world’s greatest challenges, one must only entrust each person with the tools and faith to succeed. As the world seeks to solve its most difficult problems, it faces conflicting visions: one where humanity is limited only by its potential, and one where it is limited by what some technocrats think that the potential will be. Seven billion people have a rendezvous with destiny, and to place a ceiling on what that destiny could be is to fight blindly against a history of staggering human achievement and advancement. Yes, people are expensive, but our potential is so much greater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an epic win at Yale last weekend, many Harvard students are leaving campus this week to celebrate Thanksgiving with friends and family. Thanksgiving is always a strange break for me, however, because a few days is never enough time for me to fly home to the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. Commonwealth thousands of miles away. But despite the fact that I won’t be seeing my parents this weekend, I have a lot to be thankful for—unlike many of my friends from home, my parents are not part of the 32 percent of the CNMI’s population who may lose their legal status on November 28.
When the Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. Commonwealth in 1978, the Covenant between the U.S. and the NMI permitted the islands to retain control of their immigration laws, for the purpose of allowing the local indigenous people to protect their islands from being overwhelmed by foreign immigrants. Despite this original intention, however, CNMI immigration laws permitted a large foreign workforce to enter the islands. The workers filled all levels of jobs in the CNMI, ranging from accountants and nurses to domestic workers and gas station attendants. At one point, non-resident workers comprised 85 percent of the private sector workforce, and over time the CNMI became increasingly criticized for its two-tiered society in which a majority of the population was disenfranchised.
In response to these criticisms as well as reports of labor abuses over several years, Congress included provisions in the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 to replace the CNMI immigration system with the federal system. This process, called federalization, has been met with a mix of fear and gratitude by different segments of the population. Many local people resisted federalization because it imposed on CNMI sovereignty and threatened the islands’ fragile economy.  In contrast, many guest workers supported federalization in the hope that it would help them gain a better legal status after having worked in the CNMI for decades.
Yet federalization has so far fallen short of this promise. As former Assistant Secretary to the Interior David Cohen stated on November 11, 2011, the process has been “anything but flexible.” If workers are not sponsored by an employer for a federal visa by November 27, 2011, they will lose their legal status. Yet due to the sharp decline in the CNMI economy, thousands of nonresident workers are now unemployed. Even for those with jobs, employers have been dissuaded by the cost of sponsoring their employees. While workers can apply for a green card through the normal process, the CNMI’s low minimum wage and regulations that allowed many unskilled workers into the islands means that a large number of guest workers do not meet the eligibility requirements or do not have the resources to pay for the fees. Although the CNMI non-voting delegate to Congress, Rep. Gregorio Sablan, introduced a bill to grant a status for certain categories of foreign workers, the House of Representatives went into recess without acting on the bill and will not resume their session until after legal statuses expire.
Having grown up on the island of Saipan in the CNMI, I hear every day about the fear that has been increasing as that day approaches. Although the USCIS has said that they will focus on targeting criminals for deportation initially and workers may apply for parole, the uncertainty of being separated from families and place they now consider home is producing incredible anxiety throughout the small community, in which 16,000 of the 50,000 residents may be affected. People are protesting, writing letters, and seeking legal guidance. Every day there are new stories in the local papers about workers scrambling to maintain their legal statuses and fearing being separated from their families. For students like me in the mainland, it seems like there is little we can do to help.
This unique situation clearly calls for Congress to grant a pathway to permanent residency for long-term legal guest workers in the CNMI. This will allow workers who are unemployed to more time to find jobs in the islands and remain with their families. It will also allow others to leave the islands and find employment elsewhere without forcing them to be separated from the country they now call home. Long-term guest workers in the CNMI who came legally should not have that stripped away from them; after the years they have dedicated to contributing to the economy and community of the U.S. Commonwealth, they deserve to be treated with dignity and justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
History shows that those in power often need a push in the right direction. Harvard’s 2001 Living Wage Campaign, culminating in a tent city in the Yard (which, incidentally, remained open to the public), brought justice for workers across campus. As a student involved in organizing Occupy Harvard, I’ve been frustrated that while there are many legitimate critiques to make about both the broader Occupy movement and its Harvard manifestation, most of the arguments I hear fundamentally miss the mark.
I was disturbed to see campus support for Alexandra Petri’s ’10 critique of Occupy Harvard, which accused student activists of wasting time in smelly tents when they could be studying—what she claims we should do to remedy injustice in the world. If more students understood the issues Occupy Harvard has raised, they might be less inclined to write off its efforts as the ignorant whining of a few deviant ingrates.
I repeatedly hear arguments that Harvard’s generous financial aid policy invalidates our presence. While I personally benefit from this policy and am deeply grateful for the opportunity to study here, this does not preclude my criticism of Harvard’s lack of fiscal transparency. (Nonetheless, many graduate students suffer excessive loan burdens, a major concern of the national Occupy movement.) It saddens me that students are willing to accept the argument that the “greater good” of needs-blind admission justifies a swath of unethical endowment investments, including sweatshop hotels here in America. Months ago, members of the Student Labor Action Movement—many of whom helped organize Occupy Harvard—met with Robert D. Reischauer ’63, chairman of the Harvard Corporation, to discuss Harvard’s investments in HEI Hotels and Resorts. HEI profits through a variety of exploitative practices, including union busting, speedups, and slashes to wages and healthcare (Brown already declared it won’t reinvest). When we raised critiques about Harvard’s lack of transparency, Reischauer said that if Harvard were to agree to publicly disclose its investments, students would take issue with many other items in its portfolio.
This strengthens our call for dialogue on campus about the relationship between Harvard’s dual missions of providing students a quality education and serving as a positive force in the world. A commitment to socially responsible investment by the University would benefit people all across the globe whose lives are directly impacted by the practices Harvard condones with its current investment policies.
Students argue we are too privileged to claim to represent the 99 percent. Our privileged status and proximity to power are all the more reason to speak out against injustice and, in fact, make it imperative that we do so. Critics accused another former Harvard student, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, of being a class traitor for supporting New Deal social programs and regulation of big business.
Students’ main grievance, however, revolves around the lockdown of the Yard. Unfortunately, many have been unable to disentangle the importance of the Occupy Harvard protest from the hassle of the gate closure. It’s worth pointing out that the relatively minor inconvenience of having to flash one’s ID at the gate has resulted in important gains for hundreds of workers at Harvard.
With blatant disrespect for custodians’ concerns, Petri joked we’d complain even if our janitors made $300,000 a year. That salary is near that of the top one percent of income earners in the US—hardly what’s at stake when workers spend months in bargaining over raises of eleven cents per hour.
I attended two sessions of the custodians’ contract negotiations and was struck by their resonance with Occupy’s struggle for economic justice. In response to management’s statement concerning the impact of the economic crisis on negotiations, one worker said, “The economy may not be good, but don’t tell us how bad it is. We should be telling you that. Let us hear you tell your children that you can’t pay for their medicine or schoolbooks. We the custodians should not have to bear the burden of the economy alone.” He was negotiating with a team that represents individuals making $8.4 million dollars per year.
These wage talks came after the University had caved on one of the custodians’ key demands—parity in benefits between direct and subcontracted employees. Harvard’s former policy arbitrarily denied tuition assistance and childcare benefits to hundreds of subcontracted workers. During the security guards’ contract fight, SLAM met with Bill Murphy, Harvard’s Director of Labor Relations, regarding this issue. Murphy said the provision of such benefits was not under Harvard’s purview—that we should go talk to Securitas, one of the contractors, and urge them to provide these vital benefits. With this contract settlement, Harvard has made a surprising turnaround. Not only did custodians win parity, they won it for all campus employees, including security guards and food service workers.
This huge victory for workers was not possible without the occupation. But the struggle is just beginning. We have taken action because our concerns have not been addressed through formal channels and because we value our communities, both local and global. Students should abandon superficial discourse around Occupy Harvard and think more deeply about the values motivating these efforts—inconvenient though it may be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although most Wednesdays are reserved for leadership training, today is inspection day at the MIT Reserve Officers’ Training Corps Unit and time for ROTC cadets to take the grueling Combat Fitness Test.
It’s an uncharacteristically warm November morning, but the cadets’ breath still shows in the crisp air.
The midshipmen (the common title for any ROTC cadet who is still in college) fall in line and stand at attention. They move their arms out and back repeatedly until they are standing at what seems a perfectly measured and uniform distance from one another. None of them shake; none yawn. One of the inspectors coughs in the cold air, but the expression on his face quickly returns to its prior, stony look.
Catherine A. Brown ’14 stands at least a foot shorter than every man on the field this morning and at least six inches shorter than most of the women. But she doesn’t seem intimidated in the slightest as one of her fellow midshipmen looks her up and down, assessing the uniform she hasn’t worn in weeks. Her face doesn’t change much, but she says something quietly that makes the inspector break into a short laugh. He looks her up and down and, at the last moment, picks a single piece of lint off her hat.
After the rest of the cadets are inspected they are told to “fall out,” and they all let out an easier breath.
Brown helps set up the football field for the day’s test, and Pat Cassidy, the battalion’s commanding officer and a senior at Tufts, assesses who is missing. This day, the ROTC cadets will be tested in their ability to run 880 yards, lift and carry ammo, and move during battle by participating in a complex obstacle course. The maximum times and number of lifts are more grueling for the male cadets than the females. Historically, physical fitness tests such as these and ideas about women’s physical abilities have served as hurdles to their full participation in the military.
According to a report released by the Women’s Memorial Foundation in 2010, women make up 16 percent Navy personnel, 13.5 percent of the Army, and only 7.5 percent of the Marine Corps. Women remain prohibited from serving in combat roles in the U.S. military, though they have made some gains and are allowed to serve, for example, on submarines and as fighter pilots.
Despite these restrictions, the line between men and women in uniform has begun to increasingly blur as women soldiers have fought and died in significant numbers in both Iraq and Afghanistan. According to iCasualties, an independent group that tracks military casualties, 30 American female service members have died in Afghanistan. Of those, 19 died as a result of hostile action. In Iraq, 108 women have died. Of those, 63 died in hostilities.
According to ROTC’s website, women have been “an integral part of the Army ROTC since school year 1972,” but during that time less has been expected of them. The CFT, Combat Fitness Test, is an excellent example of this. The times for a “perfect score” are lower for female cadets than male ones, and each is measured based on what the expected “best” for their gender is.
Brown, however, consistently blows these scores out of the water, scoring closer to the men’s top scores than what is expected for female cadets. In this, she is an exemplar for what military women can do.
A VERY LOCKED DOWN MIDSHIPMAN
The Combat Fitness Test begins with a run.
“Y’all ready for the worst 8 minutes of your life?” Major Craig Giorgis adds under his breath to one of the sergeants.
“We will be timing you and recording those numbers,” a sergeant says with a smile. “So run quickly.”
When the run begins Brown is at the back, but in short order she has darted to the front of the pack.
On the field, the midshipmen cheer one another on as they run, making the intimidating setup seem more like track practice than boot camp. “Oh you look good!” one cadet yells. “You are flyin‘!”
Men are expected to finish the 800-yard run in under 2:45, the perfect score for male cadets. For those who do not finish in time, a sergeant walks swiftly to the side of the track and yells, “You are a male, you didn’t cross the finish line. You do not have 100 points.”
At 5’2” it’s surprising to see how agile Brown is on the field, easily keeping up with most of the men. She finishes with a time of 3:01, 22 seconds faster than the 3:23 perfect score for women.
Brown and others cheer on the women who do not hit the maximum time until they reach the finish line. They finish their run exhausted and red-faced.
“As long as—as a female—you work hard and show you aren’t trying to get out of anything [because you’re a girl] then [men] are definitely all for you being in the military and doing PT with them,” Brown says, “It’s pretty great.”
Brown credits her ease in a male dominated field simply to her “personality.”
“I’ve always had a lot of guy friends, ever since I was little I’d always keep up with the boys.”
As the boys grew up and got “stronger and faster,” Brown says, she kept trying to keep up—clearly she figured out how.
“A very locked down midshipman,” Lieutenant Jeff Ransom says of Brown, speaking in a clipped military tone. “One of our top performing sophomores. Consistently shows it in everything she does.”
Both Ransom and Giorgin comment on how impressive Brown is academically and physically, impressed with how she can keep herself on track. Yet, Brown doesn’t seem completely satisfied with her run.
“Wasn’t my best time,” she says. The boots add a few pounds.
AMMO LIFTS
The second part of the Combat Fitness Test involves the midshipmen lifting a 30 to 35 lb. ammo box above their heads as many times as possible in two minutes.
Brown seems easily at home here on the field, picking up one of the ammo boxes it and handing it—without a hint of sarcasm—to the sergeant in charge, “This one feels light,” she says.
She is fully in her element hoisting the weight above her head, barely shaking though many of those around her are. It’s hard to believe that Brown did not grow up wanting to be a Marine.
Brown says that she never considered the military until her sophomore year of high school after taking a field trip to West Point.
“The whole idea of serving my country and the leadership training and opportunities, really appealed to me.”
She kept the idea in the back of her mind until the end of her junior year of high school. Then, when she was more convinced that she wanted to join the military, she began to broach the subject with her parents.
“Mom said, ‘no.’ And my dad was really surprised.”
She then spent the better part of a year trying to convince them of her decision.
“I didn’t grow up in a military family,” Brown says, so the idea just “never occurred” to her.
During high school, Brown spent nearly a semester convincing them that she wanted to be in the military and, more recently, a year and a half convincing them that she wanted to be a Marine.
After a spending a year in Harvard’s ROTC program and a summer program that allowed her to explore options within the Navy, Brown decided to transfer from the Navy option to the Marine option in her unit at Harvard.
“My mom said definitely no Army but started feeling okay with Navy [before I came to Harvard] ... then I came here and decided I wanted to join the Marine Corps. So my mom says I cheated.”
Brown is quick to defend her parents’ reaction to her decision, “They have nothing against the military, they’re just concerned for my safety.”
During the ammo lift, Brown reaches her max ammo lifts after about a minute and takes a break sometime in her two-minute test. Afterward, she modestly says, “I got 88. That’s the max for girls so...”
“Sixty was the max for girls,” Sergeant Evans corrects her proudly.
CATHERINE BROWN, MIDSHIPMAN
The final event of the test is an obstacle course.
“It’s a lot of effort in a short period of time,” Giorgis says of it, recalling his last test a month ago.
Each midshipman starts on the ground, jumps up and runs to the first cone, crawls to the next cone, zig-zags across the second half of the football field. Then, the midshipman picks up a soldier, dead drags him halfway across the field, and throws him over his shoulder for the second half of the run. Then, they go back across the football field with two ammo boxes, chuck a grenade, do a few push ups, and run back.
“It does not get easier as you get older,” Giorgis says.
Before stating that her goal for this round of the test is to hit the maximum time for male midshipmen, Brown, who is also a varsity lacrosse player at Harvard, explains her ease on the field with the preparation that her experience playing lacrosse has given her.
She doesn’t quite hit the 2:14 time, but at 2:26 her run easily beats the female maximum of 3:01.
Brown talks easily and happily about her life and plans, seemingly unaware at how impossible her life looks from the outside. In her eyes she is not a 5’2” female lacrosse player and student about to join the 7.5 percent of women in the Marine Corps.
She is a ROTC cadet on her way to becoming a Marine, plain and simple.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first year that undergraduates working in Boston-area internships or studying for graduate school admissions exams will be permitted to stay on campus over winter break, 94 percent of students who applied to stay at Harvard were approved, according to College spokesperson Jeff Neal.
This year, the College received 1,351 applications from students seeking campus housing in one or both of two Winter Break sessions.
Two hundred nineteen students were approved to stay on campus for Winter Break I, which runs from December 22 to January 2, while approximately 1200 students were granted housing for Winter Break II, which runs from January 3 to January 12.
The percentage of approved applications increased over last year—when 91 percent of students who submitted applications were accepted—and two years ago, when 86 percent of student applications were approved.
Despite the surge in approvals, only a small number of students took advantage of the newly accepted justifications for winter break housing. According to Neal, about 15 students applied and successfully received housing for a Boston-area internship, while an additional 15 undergraduates sought and received housing to study for the GRE, MCAT, LSAT, or GMAT exams. These applicants were provided with housing as long as they submitted proof of exam registration.
As part of a review of January term programming conducted last spring, the College created the two new categories in response to student feedback to expand winter break housing opportunities for undergraduates.
According to Neal, the decision to allow students with Boston-area internships to stay on campus during winter break reflected an increased emphasis by the Harvard Alumni Association “on bringing alumni to campus rather than encouraging alumni to create internships around the country.”
But not all students who sought to return to campus early were approved.
According to Neal, students who planned to work a paying job, take courses at other schools or universities, or participate in a student organization that had not been pre-approved—including the Hasty Pudding, Dunster House Opera and Phillips Brooks House Association—were rejected.
Aruna O. Gnanasekaran ’12 applied for housing for both Winter Break I and Winter Break II because she could not afford to fly home to California and wanted to work on campus on her philosophy thesis, which focuses on one of Plato’s dialogues.
Although she was accepted to stay on campus in January, she was denied for the first half of winter break.
Gnanasekaran has begun the appeal process by setting up a meeting with her resident dean, but she said she is worried that she will be unable to find housing for Winter Break I.
“It’s kind of unsettling that it’s a possibility to begin with because I don’t have money to go home,” Gnanasekaran said.
Christopher D. Coey ’12, who would have to pay around $3,000 to fly home to Australia, was rejected from both winter break sessions after he submitted a proposal seeking campus housing to do research on the water supply following natural disasters.
Although he has non-Harvard housing for the second half of winter break with a water engineering field course, Coey has investigated housing options on Airbnb.com, which he expects will cost about $70 per night.
“If Harvard gives me housing, it will save me nearly $1,000,” Coey said.
Although the deadline to apply for winter break housing has passed, all students will be permitted to return to campus on January 13 for Wintersession, a week of programming modelled after last year’s Optional Winter Activities Week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten Harvard-affiliated hospitals have joined forces to make their facilities tobacco-free in an effort to encourage their employees and patients to quit or make a plan to quit smoking. The new policy comes as part of the American Cancer Society’s 36th annual Great American Smokeout, a yearly push to encourage America’s 45 million smokers to give up the habit.
Over the course of the next several months, employees, patients, and visitors of these Boston-area hospitals will begin to see signs that prohibit smoking throughout hospitals’ campuses and facilities.
Smoking rates have declined since 1965, when 42 percent of Americans were reported as smokers. Since then, widespread efforts to decrease the number of smokers have had an impact, but since 1990 the incidence has plateaued at around 20 percent.
Brigham and Women’s Hospital plans to adjust its existing program to encourage inpatients to quit smoking, and will also develop a program to help support employees who wish to quit smoking. They also plan to develop strategies for sharing information about free or low-cost resources for quitting smoking.
“As a hospital it is imperative that we provide a healthy environment for our employees, our patients and our visitors. Many of our patients are extremely vulnerable when they come to us, and we need to do everything we can to protect them,” Brigham and Women’s Hospital President Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel said in a statement.
Some hospitals, such as Saint Anne’s Hospital, have been smoke-free since July. Saint Anne’s has eliminated outdoor smoking areas and prohibited tobacco products on all properties that are owned or leased by the hospital—even extending to inside of cars parked on hospital properties, according to a statement issued by the hospital.
Tobacco products are defined to include cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes. The policy seeks to reduce the health costs associated with tobacco-related illnesses, according to a statement by Saint Anne’s President Craig Jesiolowski.
“In terms of death, health conditions, lost work days, and increases in insurance premiums, smoking is the number one preventable behavior that we can positively impact,” Jesiolowski said.

Harvard Occupiers and members of the Student Labor Action Movement will gather to celebrate the custodial workers’ new contract on Tuesday. But with the most visible Occupy goal achieved and Thanksgiving break looming, the movement faces a transitional moment.
Tuesday’s rally celebrates what custodial workers’ representatives have called a “huge victory” for workers on campus. The contract guarantees, among other things, that custodial workers keep their present health care benefits and receive an increase in wages. Additionally, the contract guarantees benefit parity between contracted and direct employees of the University.
Leaders of the Occupy movement said that with the custodial contract settled, Occupy will shift its focus to other issues, specifically what protestors’ perceive to be Harvard’s socially irresponsible investments.
“I think, with the resolution of the custodial contract, that the Occupy movement is reforming itself—taking on a different focus,” said William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement. “Occupy Harvard still has several other keys issues we want to explore, most notably socially responsible investing.”
Occupy has called for Harvard to pledge not to reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts, a hotel management company that has received several complaints from the National Labor Relations Board. Branches of SEIU, the union which represents Harvard custodial workers, are boycotting select HEI locations across the country.
The reformation of the Occupy Harvard movement comes not only on the cusp of Thanksgiving break, but also as the national Occupy movement begins to face obstacles such as government opposition, dwindling numbers, and dropping temperatures.
Occupy protesters across the country, including Zuccotti Park in New York City and Acacia Park in Colorado Springs, have been evicted by state police forces, leading to the arrest of several occupiers.
Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, a SLAM member and a Crimson editorial editor, said that SLAM, whose members have been an integral part of the Occupy movement, will be stepping back from “Occupy Harvard” to pursue other issues.
“SLAM has been devoting a lot of energy into Occupy, and a huge amount of support from SLAM is not really necessary any more,” Korn said. “SLAM is going to be focusing on other things—of course, we continue to support Occupy.  But now it’s SLAM working with Occupy Harvard, not necessarily in Occupy Harvard.”
Both Korn and Whitham emphasized their belief that Occupy would last through the resolution of the custodial contract and Thanksgiving break.
“What the contract being signed means is that some people who were putting a lot of energy into that will be stepping back a little bit, while others are stepping up and taking more responsibility,” Whitham said. “While there might be fewer people in the tents over Thanksgiving, we will be increasing our outreach and education.”
For Karen A. Narefsky ’11, the presence of the tents in Harvard Yard are secondary to the intellectual consequences of the movement on Harvard’s campus.
“Whatever eventual end to the physical encampment, the Occupy movement is not over because the contract has been won,” she said. “There has been a lot of mobilization and a lot of education about issues of inequality thanks to the movement, and people will continue to engage in education and outreach whether or not tents are still standing in the yard.”

A prominent Indian businessman visited Adams House on Monday to urge Harvard students who might enter careers in business to consider India as a potential place to invest.
R. Ramakrishnan, executive director of major Indian manufacturer Bajaj Electricals, told the audience of 20 students about dramatic economic, social, and educational upheaval in India and said that the transforming nation presents unique opportunities for business.
“You guys are at the cradle of innovation,” he said to the students. “If you can create relationships with India, you can really rewrite the rules.”
Ramakrishnan did not shy away from pointing out dismal statistics about Indian society alongside facts about recent growth.
His talk, sponsored by the Harvard College U.S.-India Initiative, presented a series of stark contrasts, abundant in a country where the GDP is rising rapidly but vast portions of the population remain uneducated and extremely poor.
“I don’t want you to think that everything is hunky-dory: 300 million women in Indian cannot write their own name. ... One hundred thousand villages in India do not even have electricity,” Ramakrishnan said. “It’s a tough environment, but therein lies tremendous opportunity.”
He blamed corrupt bureaucracy for hindering change in India. “
Transforming a country as large as India is not easy,” he said. “Red tape-ism and archaic legislation are a huge problem.”
To address these issues, Ramakrishnan advocated governmental reforms that he said would increase international capitalist involvement in India and expand access to education.
Economic development will help people in all social strata, Ramakrishnan said.
“When India grows this fast, the sheer amount of transactions will result in higher income levels, bringing the poor out of their social abyss,” he said.
He mentioned that he would like to see a Harvard satellite campus in India someday.
“If someone is willing to invest in India and increase our intellectual capital, that can only be good for India,” Ramakrishnan said.
Students said they were interested in Ramakrishnan’s speech because of his first-hand business experience running a company that ranks in the top five corporate employers in India.
“As a real Indian businessman, I think he’s possibly more on point than a lot of academics on what’s really going on a daily basis,” said Christopher K. Lee ’13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Boston-area children sat on a panel alongside a man who has devoted much of his professional career to protecting kids like them from youth violence.
Harvard School of Public Health Professor David Hemenway ’66 was honored with the Striving for Justice Award by Community Works—a portfolio consisting of 34 social justice organizations—for his extensive work on implementing violence prevention programs.
At the award ceremony last Tuesday, Hemenway was accompanied by children from several Community Works member organizations. The children discussed their thoughts on violence in their communities.
“We not only seek to alleviate suffering, but eliminate the cause of the suffering,” said Community Works Executive Director Fran Froehlich. “David’s work, we feel, is contributing to understanding what’s happening ... on a social level, on a public health level.”
Froehlich added that this understanding may provide ways to help victims and perpetrators of youth violence.
Hemenway’s work in Boston has involved surveying both high-school students and adults about youth violence, with the intent of helping Boston best distribute its resources.
Hemenway thanked the mayor and city of Boston, saying they served as valuable assets for his work.
“We’re very fortunate to have such a ... progressive, strong, interested, caring government in Boston,” he said.
Hemenway and others have found a link between sleep deprivation and increased violence. He has also found that children tend to go to sleep at similar times, but some must wake up earlier due to earlier school start times.
Hemenway has also investigated the overestimation of the number of people carrying guns, as studies have shown that children believe their peers and community members carry guns at a much higher rate than they actually do.
In addition, Hemenway stressed the need to protect LGBT children, especially those who are facing bullying, as these children are most likely to be depressed or considering suicide.
“You can see from his history David is someone who cares a great deal about his community—about what it is we need to pay attention to in order to bring greater physical and emotional well-being to that community,” Froehlich said.

Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 presented the eighth annual John F. Kennedy New Frontier Awards at the Harvard Kennedy School Monday, honoring two individuals who demonstrated the ideals of her father, former President John F. Kennedy ’40.
The New Frontier committee selected Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and activist Jennifer Staple-Clark for their contributions and work in public service.
The annual awards are presented to Americans under the age of 40 whose “contribution in elected office, community service, or advocacy, demonstrates the impact and value of public service in the spirit of John F. Kennedy,” said Institute of Politics Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94.
Ravenstahl was the youngest person to ever be elected to the Pittsburgh City Council when he was 23 years-old. Three years later he was elected mayor.
Ravenstahl reduced crime in Pittsburgh to a 40 year low and worked to make the city more attractive for visiting tourists.
Jennifer Staple-Clark brought international awareness to eye care with Unite for Sight, a non-profit she founded as a sophomore at Yale University in 2000. Unite for Sight coordinates outreach programs for patients in rural communities who are unable to find or afford eye care.
“I think it is really exciting to see both the IOP and the Kennedy School recognize young leaders who demonstrate the good things that can be done through elected office and public service,” Alex A. Wirth ’15, who attended the event, said.
The ceremony was followed by a reception, where Kennedy, Ravenstahl, and Staple-Clark spoke and took photos with those in attendance.
“I think this is a great partnership between the IOP and the Kennedy Library. People we have recognized have already gone on to do incredible work,” Kennedy said. “I think it will hopefully inspire kids here to see people who are not so much older than them and to figure out a pathway to make a change.”
The award ceremony reflected the ability of young people to change the world, said IOP President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12.
“I think it shows the capacity for young people to make a difference. Even though you are 21 years old, you can still do great things,” he said.
Grayson said he hoped Staple-Clark and Ravenstahl would have an impact on current students.
“They can say, ‘If he can do that, why can’t I do that?’ We can’t all fund a nonprofit and have it be successful, but [Staple-Clark] did start it in a college dorm room,” he said.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said the event reminded him that politics “is not always about mudslinging or name-bashing.”
“It’s really about making a positive impact on the community and inspiring others,” he added.

The number of students admitted to Harvard University Health Services for alcohol-related illnesses this semester has decreased after spiking last spring, Director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Ryan M. Travia said during a talk with students about alcohol policy.
The conversation was one of two held Monday evening as part of administrators’ ongoing effort to solicit student feedback on Harvard’s drinking culture while they work toward crafting a modified alcohol policy for the College.
Over the past three years, admittances to UHS due to dangerous drinking have been rising. The number of admittances in the fall 2010 semester alone equalled the number admittances for the entire 2009-10 academic year, according to tutors who learned the statistics from College administrators during a residential tutor meeting last year.
Administrators have attributed the increase mostly to the College’s amnesty policy, which since its introduction in 2007 has promised that intoxicated students who seek medical attention will not face disciplinary action.
Travia said that the decrease in emergencies this semester might result from the Office of Student Life’s increased financial support for late-night weekend activities like movie nights and from a College-wide effort last semester to crack down on dangerous habits like drinking games.
Monday’s two meetings were held in Adams House and Pforzheimer House. Residents of Adams, Quincy, and Lowell Houses and those who live in the Quad were invited to the two gatherings.
Although the meetings were advertised over House email lists, both were sparsely attended, attracting only seven students each.
Adams House Committee Co-Chair Collin A. Rees ’12 pointed out that the participants, who were mostly DAPA members, UC representatives, and HoCo members, might not be representative of the Harvard community.
“There was a very distinct set of people here and all viewpoints weren’t represented,” Rees said. “I don’t think we saw much of the drinking side or partying sides of Harvard.”
He and Sharon L. Howell, the acting Adams House Master, said that they hope to hold a similar meeting later in the year to bring more student voices into the alcohol debate.
This is not the first such meeting to be poorly attended. At a freshman-specific discussion last month about social spaces and the ban on alcohol in Yard dorms, six students attended—four of whom were Undergraduate Council representatives.
Students at both of Monday’s meetings said they believed a lack of College social spaces leads students who are seeking alcohol to off-campus spaces like final clubs and Greek organizations where dangerous drinking is more prevalent.
Cabot House Master Stephanie Khurana said she believes that the Houses can address this problem by creating more attractive community events, like improved Stein Clubs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 128th edition of The Game on Saturday, senior quarterback Collier Winters led the Crimson to all sorts of history.
During the annual matchup between Harvard and Yale, Winters completed 27-of-42 passes to give him a 68.6 completion percentage for the year, setting the record for the highest single-season pass completion rate in Crimson history.
Harvard’s records don’t end with the individual accolades. With a decisive 45-7 victory at the Yale Bowl, Harvard has won 10 of its last 11 games—including the last five—against the Bulldogs. The Crimson matched its longest-ever winning streak in the series, and the victory allowed Harvard seniors to go undefeated at The Game in their careers.
Winters’ success over the weekend was no accident—he had been training and working towards improving his accuracy leading up to the season.
“One of my goals as far as throwing the ball was to have a high completion percentage,” Winters said. “I worked on it all spring and summer, just trying to come into the season making really good decisions and being accurate with my throws.”
Some of the quarterback’s regular targets were confident that he would be able to realize this objective in his final season for the Crimson.
“It was something that [Winters] had mentioned early in preseason, during the first time we met as a team to set out some of our goals,” junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk said. “He mentioned that he had a very high goal for what his completion percentage would be, [and] we all felt that he would be able to meet that.”
Early in the season, Winters battled injury that kept him on the sidelines for four games.
But since coming back, he has reasserted himself as one of the best passers in the league. On Saturday, he threw for 355 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a third.
The quarterback fumbled at the Yale five-yard line on Harvard’s first drive, but it was the only major blunder in an otherwise seamless performance.
“Going into the game, my goal was the same as it is every week: take care of the ball and make good decisions,” Winters said. “Outside of the fumble I had in the first quarter, we were able to do that as an offense.”
The Bulldogs scored first, but the Crimson was resilient. Winters responded to the early touchdown by leading the offense on a 73-yard drive to tie the score at seven.
The Crimson never relented after that first score, putting up another 38 unanswered point en route to the 45-7 win.
Juszczyk, who has played with Winters in his three years as starting quarterback, was excited by the passer’s strong finish to the season.
“I think Collier had a phenomenal weekend,” Juszczyk said. “It was great to see him go out that way, and it is really nice to have such an accurate quarterback on our team.”
Despite the early injury, Winters was a powerful leader throughout the season.
His consistency under center helped Harvard win the Ivy League title and go undefeated in the Ancient Eight.
“He has been a phenomenal leader and a great teammate,” Juszczyk said. “Anytime you go down to the locker room, you will see that Collier is there before anybody else, watching film or studying up on his opponents. He is a vocal leader: He does a good job of speaking out, but also speaking with his playing.”
Juszczyk made it clear that this weekend was bittersweet for the younger members of the team. The exciting finish to the season was accompanied by the realization that Winters and the other Crimson seniors had played their final game.
“We are going to miss him a lot,” Juszczyk said of Winters.
But no one could have crafted a better send-off for the talented quarterback.
“It was a special weekend,” Winters said, “especially for the seniors to be able to go out like we did, undefeated against Yale and undefeated in the Ivy League this year. To be able to end my career and end our season that way was a lot of fun.”

After three losses on the road, Harvard women’s basketball could use a reversal of fortune at home. The Crimson (0-3) will play Rhode Island tonight in its first action at Lavietes Pavilion this season, the first contest of a three-game home stand for Harvard.
For the Crimson, the game plan is simple.
“We just have to come out hard and play a consistent 40 minutes of basketball with a tough defensive mentality,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “If we play as a team and depend on each other, good things will come.”
The Rams come in with a 1-3 record after losing their last game on Saturday at Siena, 73-65. Rhode Island’s sole victory is a 52-43 win over Providence, a team that beat Harvard on Friday.
Across a number of statistical categories, the two teams are evenly matched. Harvard and Rhode Island both average about 11 assists per game, shoot close to 40 percent from from the field, and have been plagued by turnovers in their first few games of the season.
But as Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith sees it, Harvard only needs to worry about itself.
“It is about our offense and our defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “It isn’t really about who we’re playing.”
For Harvard, that may be easier said than done. In its first three games of the season, the Crimson has averaged just under 70 points per game, but the team’s defense has surrendered about 77.
“I don’t worry as much about scoring, to be honest,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we have a lot of people who can score. If [Berry] doesn’t have a big night, someone else will.”
But taking care of the basketball has been an issue for a Crimson offense that has averaged 17.3 turnovers per game.
“We haven’t had any indication that turnovers would be a problem for us, so the fact that it was in the Providence game was a surprise to us,” Delaney-Smith said. “Some people that have stepped into a new role have to make sure that they make good decisions with the ball.”
The Crimson, who lost its first three games by an average of about seven points, understands the value of each offensive possession.
“[Minimizing turnovers] is extremely important,” Berry said. “During practice we’ve really concentrated on taking care of the ball along with the defensive side of the game. We need to focus on all of the little things in the upcoming game.”
Despite three losses to start the year, Berry looks at it more as an issue of growing pains than any long-term issue.
“We’re not connecting as well as we thought we would on the court,” Berry said. “We have a lot of team chemistry, and I think in the first three games, we haven’t been able to harness that and make it productive.”
That, Berry hopes, will change starting Tuesday.
“We’re really starting to focus our energy on being better teammates,” Berry said. “That involves being a better defensive and rebounding team because [defense and rebounding] were definitely our weak points in the past three years.”
A strong defensive effort will be a key factor in beating the Rams on Tuesday. In its first four games this season, Rhode Island has displayed a balanced scoring attack. Junior guard Ajannae Boone has not started a single game for the Rams but leads the team in scoring and is one of four players who average more than eight points per game.
Berry thinks the leadership of returning players will also help the Crimson get its first tally in the wins column.
“[Sophomore guard Christine Clark and I] definitely bring a sense of intensity and passion for the game,” Berry said. “I think if everybody can stem from that, our scoring, defense, rebounding, and passing will come. Hopefully everybody can bring that same level of intensity.”
But Berry believes that most importantly, the Crimson needs to focus on its own abilities instead of Rhode Island’s talents.
“We really need to focus on playing Harvard basketball,” Berry said. “We’re not going to lose to our opponents, we’re going to lose to ourselves.”

The Harvard University Boat Club’s 2010-2011 season was bookended by two-second losses to the University of Washington.
After an 8.5-second margin of victory in the Head of the Charles’ Championship Eight event opened this season, the Crimson has to be hoping for another symmetrical finish.
Last year, Harvard and UW came into Camden, N.J., for the season’s final challenge with undefeated 1V records, and although the Crimson drew first blood with a semifinal win at Washington’s expense, the Huskies still came out on top.
I can’t tell you that Harvard will run the tables this year, complete its second Sprints-Henley double in three years, and give Harry Parker a well-deserved 50th anniversary present of an IRA victory.
But as the fall season comes to a close and the team heads towards a long winter indoors, I can’t imagine a group more motivated.
With legendary coach Harry Parker battling cancer, motivation to win for him is higher than ever—if that’s even possible. Certainly, the senior class deserves high praise for its leadership as well. Two years ago, five sophomores—Pat Lapage, Matt Edstein, Nick Jordan, Sam O’Connor, and Mike DiSanto—made it into the first varsity eight, and the boat won both Eastern Sprints and the Ladies’ Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta.
Not all of these seniors are currently competing in the 1V this year, but the class of 2012 has embodied the work ethic and dedication on which the whole team prides itself.
You could certainly say Harvard’s success has a lot to do with the talents of its top rowers, many of whom have experience competing for their respective national teams. Just this past summer, Lapage and sophomore standout Andy Holmes earned a bronze medal at the U23 World Championships while competing with the Great Britain men’s eight. Closer to home, DiSanto stroked the U.S. four to the A final.
But whenever I spoke to DiSanto, now the team’s captain, after one of the team’s many victories last year, he talked about the team’s motivation coming “from the bottom up.” This past weekend, Lapage used the exact same phrase.
Lapage has been the stroke of the 1V since his sophomore year, and even he speaks of the need to fight for his seat. Junior James O’Connor, another one of the Crimson’s top rowers, expressed a similar concern.
“We’re all fighting tooth and nail,” he said after Saturday’s Tail of the Charles, which he, Lapage, and Holmes won while rowing with junior rower Josh Hicks and junior coxswain David Fuller.
Regardless of any desire to win Sprints, Henley, and IRA gold, the rowers are also motivated by a recognition of the talent on the entire team.
Because truly, no one’s seat is safe this year.
Last spring, the Crimson Sports Board named Parker runner-up to Coach of the Year, and when I was interviewing him for a 400-word article that in no way encapsulated his greatness, one of the first things he talked about was the team’s depth.
“One of the contributing factors is the fellows [who] have stayed with the program, whether they’ve been in the first crew or the second or the third,” he said.
Similarly, at the two Head of the Charles banquets I’ve attended, the first thing Parker has done is to call the members of the third and fourth varsity eights to stand up so their accomplishments can be recognized.
While covering the team last year, I watched the fourth varsity eight walk away from Princeton’s 3V, and Harvard’s 3V maintain overlap with its own 2V. Just this past weekend, the Crimson’s E four took sixth overall, ahead of its own C and D fours as well as Brown’s B four.
The determination of non-1V/2V rowers has kept the entire team on its toes and will continue to do so this winter.
When 1V and 2V rowers attribute their own successes to rowers in the 3V and 4V, it’s not to be nice.
It’s a statement of fact.

Though she already boasts four All-Ivy first team recognitions, two Academic All-American distinctions, and a Harvard diploma, Claire Richardson ’11 added something pretty special to her resumé on Monday: a national title.
Richardson, a former member of the Harvard women’s cross country team, competed in her fifth year of NCAA eligibility with Georgetown University in 2011. The Hoyas shocked the collegiate cross country world by edging out the University of Washington and two-time defending national champion Villanova University at the NCAA Division I Championship Meet to take home the trophy.
Richardson was Georgetown’s second runner at the meet, which was hosted by Indiana State University. The St. Paul, Minn. native led a pack of four Hoyas who sealed the squad’s victory by all finishing in a nine-second span. Richardson topped her personal-best time while at Harvard by covering the six-kilometer course in 20:38.
“Claire was incredibly hard-working,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “She was tireless in her pursuit of academic and athletic success. [The national championship] is very well-deserved, I couldn’t be happier for her.”
Georgetown fell to conference rival Villanova at the Big East Championship Meet three weeks ago. Though Wildcat senior Sheila Reid walked away with the individual title on Monday, it was Richardson and the Hoyas who had the last laugh.
Saretsky indicated that the cross country program played a major role in influencing Richardson’s decision to attend Georgetown for graduate school.
It looks like that decision paid off.

It's Thanksgiving break and most are headed home for some turkey and mashed potatoes. However, getting to the airport can be a hassle, especially if your plane leaves at 4 a.m. when taking the T isn't an option. If you're considering taking a cab, don't forget about UC Taxis, which can save you money by helping you find other Harvard students who need to get to Logan airport as well.
All Harvard students can gain access to the service by simply logging into the website with a Facebook account. Once logged in, students can search for fellow students with similar departure times and contact them to share a taxi. A neat feature of the site is that students are allowed to put a preference for their pick-up location, all in an effort to facilitate an easy journey back home.
Safe travels!
