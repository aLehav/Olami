After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I’d like to dedicate this to all the nematodes and hyperthermophilic bacteria who live in deep-water sulfide chimneys around the world,” says Mark, the narrator of Mark Leyner’s recent novel, “Gone With The Mind.”  While the phrase may sound like the beginning of a scientific research paper, “Gone With The Mind” is far from academic discourse, exploring Mark’s childhood, the artistic process, and a variety of other topics ranging from extremophiles to the Oedipal complex. With its honest stream-of-consciousness style and humorous absurdity, “Gone With The Mind” may seem to be about nothing, but its many disjointed ideas combine to make it a unique exploration of the life of an artist and human being in the modern era.
The premise of “Gone With the Mind” seems simple enough: The entire book takes place in a mall food court where Mark—called only by his first name—is giving a reading of his new novel. The plot involves almost no physical action, the story a journey of the mind rather than the body that features adventures through the landscape of memories, thoughts, and fears. In effect, the reading, with comments from Mark’s mother and the two uninterested food court workers, is essentially the novel itself. It would be impossible to understand Mark’s ramblings if it were not for his mother, Muriel, who conveys the tale of Mark’s childhood and roots Mark’s reading in reality.  Her portion of the novel mostly relates small details of his youth, such as his love for books and his loss of a sister due to the incompetence of the doctors attending to his mother at the infant’s birth. Beyond this section, there is no plot, as Mark jumps from topic to topic in his exploration of interiority. For example, he easily jumps from talking about the difficult process of writing the novel in one section to discussing the meaning behind Twizzler or Mr. Potato Head commercials, but he manages to unite these concepts thematically.
One such unifying motif is that of the Imaginary Intern. Mark nonchalantly mentions “how the Imaginary Intern was conjured up” from “the tiles on the bathroom floor… just staring at the vein patterns and at the craquelure on this one particular tile, and I discerned a legible face,” as if it were normal to create an imaginary being to talk to when one needs inspiration. From this point on Mark speaks about the Imaginary Intern as if he were a physical presence. The Imaginary Intern may seem like the delusion of a deranged man, but his presence in the novel provides a way to explore the artistic process in modern society.  With the overbearing presence of the internet and distractions in the modern world, it is no longer possible for an artist to immerse himself in a work so as to completely avoid the outside. Rather, Mark uses his observations about the world, which are many times random and unconnected, to explore his own relation to the people and events around him.  The Imaginary Intern’s input on what Mark should write reveals the strenuous process of using these different ideas to relay some sort of message and finding a means to use one’s talents to make something with purpose. While it may be an unorthodox way to explain art-making methods, Mark’s imaginary friend allows him to discuss the ways to connect his many thoughts and conveys how this is done right before the reader’s eyes, making this aspect of the novel both entertaining and instructional.
However, perhaps the most powerful theme is that of the strength of the relationship between a mother and her son. Mark’s mother is the only other main speaker in the novel, and the majority of his childhood is composed of experiences shared with his mother. While he sometimes says things that appear unflattering, such as saying that his mom speeds when driving drunk or that the Oedipal complex should serve as the inspiration for their relationship, he ultimately reveals that he adores his mother with profound devotion: “There was a golden age for me when it was just my mother and myself, and this is still the idealized world I long for, still the mythic, primordial time.” As the novel demonstrates, there is nothing strange about Mark’s relationship with his mother. In reality, the book is a moving way for Mark to give tribute to his mother for her lasting impact in his life.
Beyond being an exploration of deeper ideas,“Gone With The Mind” is simply enjoyable:  Leyner’s unique and at times grotesque humor lends the novel a light-hearted, interesting tone. For example, he often interjects his stories with a side reference to the actual state of the food court, with comments such as, “Mark clasps his hands to his heart and gives his MOM the most fervent look of esteem and affection one could possibly imagine” —which would not be strange if he had not just previously said, “How does it feel seeing your mother disappear with that lowlife scumbag who’s got his hand down her pants?” This strange, funny way of viewing the world keeps the book engaging as one tries to understand Mark, who is in turn trying to understand himself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 6, at the general meeting of the Graduate Student Council, student representatives from graduate programs across the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will vote on a resolution that condemns the University leaders for filing an amicus brief against graduate student unionization. The resolution proposed by John Gee, the Vice President of the GSC, states “Whereas graduate student workers at Harvard ought to decide freely and democratically whether they wish to unionize and bargain collectively…this [filing of the amicus brief] by Harvard interferes with the democratic rights of graduate student workers....” I believe the democratic rationale provided for the resolution is misguided and that it should be voted down.
The resolution’s underlying premise claims that the principle of democracy suggests students should be left alone to decide whether to unionize among themselves. This view is the basis of the union organizers’ efforts to solicit neutrality agreements from the University faculty and administrators. This argument is, however, based on a narrow conception of democracy and is therefore an insufficient ground on which to deliberate on the important issue of student unionization.
Democracy is a political instrument for the discovery of truth regarding justice and the good life. It requires active participation of informed citizens and political institutions to facilitate debate among them. Citizens must engage in good faith with one another and deliberate on issues that concern the public using reason and the best available evidence presented to them. Decision by majority is one important feature of democracy but not its sole defining character.
This vision of democracy forces us to confront many problematic features of the current unionization movement. First, we lack a body of students who are sufficiently informed about the specifics of the unionization necessary to deliberate properly on the issue. As a former organizer of the movement, I experienced firsthand how easy it could be to gain support from individual students, who often uncritically accepted without a moment of reflection on the suggestion that a union could significantly improve the experiences of graduate students. Such behavior is not conducive to forming an informed citizenry.
Unfortunately, this trend has not changed since the start of the organizing campaign. Too many still base their decisions to support or oppose on their ideological leanings without inquiring what issues a union can appropriately address and how. This tendency has been encouraged by the union organizers, who put a far greater priority on the rapid expansion of the organization’s membership over the education of its members on substantive matters. Despite its recent public celebration of reaching majority support as suggested by the number of graduate students who signed the authorization cards, the union supporters cannot claim a democratic victory.
More concerning is the union organizers’ efforts to suppress meaningful conversations among community members necessary for an effective deliberation on the important issue under the pretext of neutrality. The University faculty and administrators have legitimate roles to play in the conversation on unionization since the proposed student union will potentially impact the wider University community significantly. Along with students, they should actively engage in the decision making process. Asking them to remain neutral is asking them to abandon their duty as democratic citizens of the University to act according to what they believe to be in the best interests of the community as a whole.
One way the University leaders have chosen to partake in the conversation is by jointly filing the aforementioned brief with the National Labor Relations Board, the governing authority on labor disputes in this nation, before which contending parties argue for their positions on questions such as whether graduate students at private universities have the right to unionize. By filing the brief, the University is following the rules and procedures of the nation’s democratic system designed to deliberate on the present issue.
Union supporters should perceive the filing of the brief not as a threat to their right to organize but as an opportunity to engage the University leaders’ arguments. For instance, Section I(d) of the brief states “Because the Amici institutions do not measure teaching and research by graduate assistants in commercial or economic terms, the model of traditional collective bargaining cannot apply to them” and makes a strong case for the proposition. Union supporters should produce compelling arguments that can trump the logic behind the University’s arguments, like this one, rather than attempting to silence the University’s voice.
In addition, University leaders so far have not resorted to ungentlemanly tactics in advancing their position such as unfairly disciplining union organizers. They have acted in ways consistent with the democratic vision and have even made genuine efforts to improve the experiences of graduate students in areas that are purported sources of discontent and conflicts. For this, the leaders deserve our respect.
I am against Vice President Gee’s resolution because it is inconsistent with the requirements of democracy in its truer sense, as I have attempted to illustrate above. For this reason, I ask that the GSC representatives vote against it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One day last week, I woke up with a ringing in my left ear.
I pinched my nose and puffed up my cheeks. I moved my jaw from side to side. I went to the gym. I took a shower. Nothing worked, and the ear kept ringing.
Later, at University Health Services, a family nurse practitioner rang a tuning fork against the back of my head. He patted his hands along the sides of my face and down my jawbone, testing to see if I might have the mumps, which I did not. He asked me to smile, frown, lift up my arms, and squeeze his hands, testing to see if I might be having a stroke, which I was not.
This nice man diagnosed me with something called “idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss,” prescribed me steroids, and sent me to an ear, nose, and throat doctor who, two days later, told me my hearing was hunky dory. All the same, because better safe than sorry, he suggested I get a fuller battery of ear tests and an MRI.
“Oh, no,” I thought. “I’m dying.”
I spent the rest of the day thinking about the rest of my life. How would I spend my remaining year, month, or week? When was the right time to tell everyone I loved them? Whom did I love, anyway? Was it worth graduating, or should I skip town and see the world? And what did this whole “life” thing mean?
And then it hit me. I am almost definitely not dying. But, though the days of my life are far from numbered, the countdown clock on my college career is ticking toward zero. If there’s any mortality worth contemplating, that’s the one: College-me is about to bite the dust.
Thinking of the end of our time at Harvard the same way we think of the end of our lives might seem morbid, and perhaps it is. Yet it’s also useful. A version of each of us seniors really is about to die.
We’ve spent four years not just growing up, but growing into this particular place. We have formed around it, sometimes unconsciously but sometimes, as we’ve cultivated and even performed the kind of people we want to be, quite consciously indeed.
The moment we walk out of Johnston Gate for the last time, those selves will cease to be—they’ll have to, without the concentrations, clubs, and communities that made them who they’ve been from 2012 until today. In a very scary way, who we are right now depends on how we’ve built ourselves around and into the structures that make up Harvard—whether we’ve fashioned ourselves into artists or athletes, readers or writers. In the whole new world we’re about to enter, everything we’re contingent on will disappear. We will become whole new people. It might feel a little like rebirth.
It’s worth asking the same sort of questions about these final college-life moments that we’d ask about the final moments of capital-L Life. How will we spend our remaining two months? Should we go out more and drink more, or go out more and drink less? Should we stay home and talk to our roommates instead? When, and how, should we tell our friends we love them? Whom do we love, whom have we forgotten, and how can we remember? Most of all, if our college selves are whatever we constructed them to be, what does this whole "college" thing mean once we’re gone?
My ear is still ringing, but I don’t mind. My head is too full with the echo of these questions. After so much thinking in the classroom, we can finally start thinking about what matters most to us both in and outside of it, and why we chose that way. We can also start thinking about what we want our answers to mean going forward: whether we should preserve the personas we’ve so carefully curated here or whether we should cast them aside. We could also do nothing at all. Like death, leaving college is frightening. Also like death, the end may be less bitter than bittersweet. It’s only the end, of course, because there has already been a beginning and a middle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At last May’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, the College changed its policy to allow mixed-gender rooming in every upperclassman House. Less than a year later, some undergraduates are calling for the application of the same standard to freshman housing in an effort to meet the needs of all students. We believe that this change—now being contemplated by administrators—would be a positive step towards promoting student comfort and safety.
Under the current system, incoming freshman are able to contact the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and the Freshman Dean’s Office to request gender-neutral housing outside of the usual housing preference form. At the University of Pennsylvania, however, freshmen are able to easily request gender-neutral housing. The extra step of having to contact administrators directly could leave students, especially those who identify as BGLTQ, facing an uncomfortable rooming situation that exacerbates the already-difficult transition to college life. Because freshmen are not allowed to choose their roommates, those requesting gender-neutral housing are not doing so simply to live with friends of the opposite gender.
In expanding mixed-gender rooming to all Houses in 2014, the College effectively recognized gender-neutral rooming options as a matter of necessity, not one of convenience. And students seem to agree: In 2013, an Undergraduate Council referendum calling for gender-neutral housing across the College was supported by 85 percent of voters. “I look forward to the day when all students across this campus can go into their Houses and form gender-neutral housing arrangements without having to go through major hurdles,” Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said at the time. There is no reason that this standard should not apply to freshmen as well via the option to request a gender-neutral room on the first-year housing form.
In the case of transgender students, the issue is even more pressing. Last month’s vandalization of a sign on a gender-neutral bathroom in Eliot House is just one indication of why transgender students need options in their housing choices. Furthermore, as we recently opined, the pervasive nature of transphobia was reflected in North Carolina’s state government passing legislation that prevents municipalities from passing anti-discrimination laws based on gender or sexual orientation.
In addition to prioritizing this concern for freshmen, the College should look to standardize procedures across the Houses. In place of the varying forms and procedures, a uniform “check the box” process would prevent any disparities. Every student who wishes to live in a gender-neutral rooming group should be able to do so without jumping through unnecessary administrative hurdles. This is the logical next step in the implementation of the College’s 2014 policy changes and in the ever-evolving effort to cater to students’ needs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists at a discussion on campaign finance reform at Harvard Law School asserted that candidates in this presidential election cycle have not emphasized reform initiatives, despite public support for amending campaign finance laws.
Sponsored by the Harvard American Constitution Society, Law School Democrats, and Law School Republicans, the Friday afternoon panel featured four panelists from across the political spectrum.
Joseph L. Breen, an organizer of the event and student at the Harvard Kennedy School, emphasized that he wanted to demonstrate bipartisan support for campaign finance reform by having two conservative and two liberal members on the panel.
“This really is bipartisan when you talk to people on the street, but for some reason when you get up into Congress, it becomes a partisan issue,” he said.
Panelists also discussed the apparent disconnect between current party officials and the electorate.
“We’ve had many political conservatives stand up for campaign finance reform over many years,” Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who identifies as a conservative, said. “And one of the questions we have is why not the current elected members of the House and Senate.  And the answer to that is quite clear, they are addicted to the campaign cash.”
Panelists said that this year’s presidential candidates have also largely ignored campaign finance reform in the public sphere.
Max Stahl, director of political engagement at Democracy Matters, a  non-profit, said the national media’s focus on polling and primary results has led to less coverage of substantive issues.
“We really don’t have democracy, we have this illusion of democracy. As candidates put it, politics are reported on like sports on TV,” Stahl said.
John Pudner, executive director of Take Back Our Republic, a conservative group, said although Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump has come closest to addressing campaign finance reform, even the business tycoon has never gone beyond mentioning it as a problem.
"I don’t think Trump has ever proposed a solution,” Pudner said.
Multiple panelists stressed the importance of campaign finance reform because it influences other political issues.
“The current system of campaign finance reform does have these implications and effects on a number of issues that people may care about more personally,” said Breen.
Painter mentioned national security as one of the issues.
“Campaign finance is a national security threat because when you put global corporate wealth with first amendment free speech right to influence U.S. political campaign, we are opening up our political process to sources all over the world,” he said.
John Polansky, a first-year law student who attended the panel, also noted the divide between the public and election candidates.
“There is, just by nature of the disparity between the polling of the public and the candidates in the election, a huge issue,” he said.

To demand a fix for the “leaky pipeline,” members of the graduate student unionization effort, along with undergraduates and university employees, rallied just steps away from University President Drew G. Faust’s office for the formation of a collective bargaining unit on Friday.
The event, organized by the Civil Rights Committee of the unionization effort, brought together speakers from a broad spectrum of racial, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds outside of Massachusetts Hall. Organizers demanded that administrators address pipeline issues, which are obstacles that lead to higher attrition rates for underrepresented minorities in doctoral programs.
Felix Owusu, a graduate student and a member of the Civil Rights Committee who emceed the protest to the crowd of roughly 60 people, spoke about the issues minorities face in graduate education, including academic isolation, lack of a support system, and relatively few minority faculty who can serve as mentors to minority students.
“They told me that I would face isolation here. They told me that well-meaning institutions, even ones that meant the best, would be woefully unprepared in supporting me,” Owusu said, referring to cautionary warnings other minority students gave him about pursuing a Ph.D.
Owusu added, “I would not be up here, where I am today or at this institution, if it were not for a supportive group of graduate student workers who showed me solidarity and prepared me for what I was going to be facing.”
While several students touched on their personal experiences as minorities, graduate student David Nee spoke of his experience coming from a background of “privilege.” Nee said he personally believes that one cause of the leaky pipeline is “the failure of privileged students to be more active in demanding institutional change.”
Nee said being a “mixed-race man who passes for white” and coming from an upper-middle class family where both of his parents received Ph.D.s from Harvard  “cushioned” him against the issues that minority students face.
“We talk a lot about white privilege. I think we need to talk more about white complicity,” Nee said. “If I’m not oppositional, I am complicit.”
Owusu said a collective bargaining unit provides a “clear vehicle for change.” In late February, members of the union effort announced that a majority of graduate students employed by the university supported unionization.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences administration has sought to increase diversity within the school. In the 2014-2015 school year, eight percent of enrolled students were underrepresented minorities. The GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs “is committed to expanding the pool of talented students who apply to graduate school,” according to its website.
Undergraduate student Brianna Suslovic ’16, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, said visibility is important to show students of color that a doctoral education is possible.
“How am I supposed to feel about a career in academia when there are so few TFs of color, when there are so few graduate students of color who are visible to me?” Suslovic said.
GSAS has created several summer outreach programs in effort to help fix the pipeline, such as the Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program, which places minority undergraduates in research labs and matches them with graduate students for informal mentoring.
With regard to the speaker lineup, Owusu said there was no shortage of supporters from diverse backgrounds who wanted to share their experiences. Graduate student unionization members were joined by dining hall workers, women in STEM, and a member of Reclaim Harvard Law.
The rally was punctuated by high-energy chants, such as “Harvard fix your leaky pipes, support grad workers of all stripes.” A few freshmen living in Matthews were brought outside by the noise.
At the end of the rally, Owusu and others attendants said “we’ll be back.”

Students from the College and Harvard Medical School joined medical students from Tufts University and members of activist groups to stage a die-in Friday in front of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, claiming a recent study from a professor there is biased.
About two dozen protesters demanded that Joseph A. DiMasi, an associate professor at Tufts, disclose the specific names of the pharmaceutical companies that fund his research. The study, which DiMasi led and published in March, claims that it costs $2.87 billion, in 2013 dollars, to develop each new drug. A previous study he led in 2007 claimed it was $1.2 billion, in 2005 dollars.
“DiMasi’s figures are used by pharmaceutical companies to preserve the status quo and their bottom line,” a press release for the protest read, claiming his relationship with the pharmaceutical companies presents a conflict of interest for his research.
Apart from Harvard and Tufts students, protesters at the Tufts center included members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, an activist group advocating for rights to essential medicines for diseases including AIDS and Hepatitis B.
In an emailed response to protest organizers, DiMasi wrote that the studies do not imply an association between research expenses and the high cost of drugs.
“Our paper not only does not explicitly link [research and development] costs to price setting,” he wrote, “it does not do so implicitly either.”
According to Christopher Noble, a representative of the AIDS advocacy groups ACT UP Boston, while the financial disclosure statement on the Tufts center’s website says 40 percent of its funding comes from the pharmaceutical industry, the specific names of the companies are not disclosed.
“At the beginning of every lecture that we have when we have a guest lecturer, they always have a slide that says, ‘These are my conflicts of interest,’” Rolvix Patterson, a student at Tufts University School of Medicine who attended the protest, said. “We would hope that Tufts would hold industry leaders like the people at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development to the same standards that we hold our medical professors.”
Kenneth I. Kaitin, the center’s director and a professor at Tufts, said it was not the center’s policy to disclose specific names of pharmaceutical companies.
“If there was a question about who supports the CSDD I think that that is adequately described, not only in the paper he published, but on our website, so I’m not sure what else is required,” he said, referring to the center’s acronyms.
The protest was part of a larger movement against large pharmaceutical companies called “Pharma Fools Day,” and protests took place in 12 cities around the world, including London, Johannesburg, Sydney, and New Delhi, according to movement's website.
“The overall message [of all the protests] is that pharmaceutical company greed is killing patients,” Justin Mendoza, a new ACT UP member, said.  ACT UP organized the protests with support from more than 25 other health advocacy groups.
Protesters gathered at the Tufts Medical Center, came up with chants, and distributed signs,  according to Patterson. They then walked over to the the drug development center while chanting.
Once there, they staged a die-in which symbolized the notion that people are dying because they cannot access medicine, according to Shayla B. Partridge ’18, a member of Global Health and AIDS Coalition who attended the protest. GHAC is a student group at the College.

Responding to congressional inquiry about university endowments, Harvard released an extensive document Friday explaining how its $37.6 billion endowment advances its educational—and tax-exempt—mission.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Congressman Kevin P. Brady, and Congressman Thomas W. Reed II have begun to consider whether large university endowments, including Harvard’s,  should be taxed. In a letter they sent in February to colleges and universities with endowments larger than $1 billion, the members of Congress asked a series of questions about how their endowment funds operate. University President Drew G. Faust submitted a public, wide-ranging response Friday.
The explanatory document, prepared in consultation with several Harvard offices, answers the Congress members’ 13 questions and delineates the function and purpose of the University's investment pool. It makes clear that much of the money in the 13,000 individual funds that make up Harvard’s endowment—$31 billion, or 84 percent of the total—remains restricted by the original terms of donors’ gifts. Harvard uses about 5 percent of the endowment every year for its annual operating budgets. Last year, this money funded roughly a third of Harvard’s operating expenses, including financial aid, the document notes.
In an interview Friday, Faust said that she aimed to clear common misconceptions about Harvard’s endowment—the largest of any university—with the public document.
“So many people do not understand how endowments work and they criticize them for being pots of money that we are just hoarding, and I wanted to explain that we live on the income that that pot of money can make every year,” Faust said.
Portions of the document elucidate details about how the Harvard Management Company manages the funds. In response to a question posed regarding how much the University spends each year to manage the endowment, the document outlines that the Harvard Management Company is undergoing a review of its compensation system.
Over the last 5 years, HMC has consistently underperformed relative to its peers, prompting a series of leadership and administrative changes. Stephen Blyth took the helm of Harvard’s investment arm in early 2015 after Jane L. Mendillo stepped down the year before.
The document also notes that HMC conducted a study of its “hybrid” model of internal and external fund management. The results showed that the Harvard model consistently saved Harvard money over the last decade as compared to an all-externally managed model, like that of Yale.
“The management cost for HMC’s internally managed endowment funds is generally below 0.75 percent, while the cost of externally managed endowment funds generally averages 1–2 percent of assets under management,” the report notes.
Faust wrote an introduction to the 23-page memorandum, arguing that the Harvard’s endowment “maintains the teaching and research mission of the university.”
“The recognition and support the tax code offer to nonprofit organizations remain critical to Harvard’s success and excellence,” Faust wrote. “Fundamentally, as with all tax-exempt organizations, Harvard’s non-profit status guarantees to its supporters and the larger community that its resources are dedicated to its charitable mission and larger societal benefits rather than to profit-making.”
A number of offices and administrators across the central administration helped prepare the document, which comes as university endowments, and Harvard’s in particular, have increasingly become the subject of scrutiny. This is not the first time Congress has challenged growing university endowments—in 2008, Senator Charles E. Grassley proposed legislation that enforce mandatory payout minimums.
In Connecticut, Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced he would veto legislation intended to tax Yale’s $25.6 billion endowment.
In fiscal year 2015, Harvard’s endowment grew 5.8 percent to $37.6 billion, trailing the rate of growth at many peer institutions, including Princeton, Yale, and MIT.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly four years after stepping into Annenberg Hall for the first time, seniors returned to the freshman dining hall Sunday morning to reminisce over eggs, french toast, waffles, and champagne-filled flutes. 
Organized by the Senior Class Committee, the annual Senior Champagne Brunch reunites senior with their freshman entryways and proctors as an occasion to catch up just months before graduation.
"It was really awesome getting to see my freshman entryway and catch up with all of them again,”  Sarah S. Sohn ’16 said. “We drifted apart in the interim.”
A historic landmark on campus and a harbinger of memories during one’s freshman year, Annenberg Hall ushered in a degree of nostalgia for the seniors in attendance.
“The Senior Class Brunch is an opportunity for Harvard University to invite seniors back into their freshman dining hall, and for them to use it as a social space once again,” Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson, Crista Martin, said. “Many seniors miss Annenberg Hall after moving into their upperclassman dining halls.”
Between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., entryways rotated through the dining hall to take pictures, eat brunch, and catch up with classmates. To many in attendance, the event offered more than a entryway reunion.
"It's a really great thing just getting to walk around all the tables and talk to fellow classmates, not just those in my entryway.” Ali M. Monfre ’16 said.
Many seniors remarked upon the degree of separation they had felt from members of their entryway after freshman year, when they were no longer living under the same roof of a freshman dorm, or running into one another in Yard between classes.
"Getting to see freshman classmates will probably be the best part,” said Louisa McIntyre ’16, as she walked into the event.  “I miss them quite a bit.”
Others appreciated lighter matters, such as the ability to enjoy champagne, provided by Harvard for the special occasion.
“It’s a good thing I got here early for the champagne.” Steven P. Barroqueiro ’16 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent interpretations of Title IX by the Office of Civil Rights that broadly define sexual harassment have created a “chilling” effect at America’s colleges and universities, threatening academic freedom, due process, and free speech, argues a recent report released by the American Association of University Professors.
The report characterizes OCR as conflating conduct and speech cases, creating a “seemingly limitless definition of harassment” without explicitly reaffirming the protected speech of classroom instructors, leaving faculty who teach and research sensitive topics related to gender, sex, sexuality, and rape law vulnerable to sexual harassment charges.
The report points specifically to the 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter, a guiding document released by the U.S. Department of Education, which defines sexual harassment simply as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” including sexual violence, “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
“I have heard from a number of colleagues, not just in criminal law but in other subjects, that they are now unwilling to teach any cases having to do with sex or sexuality, that they’re scrubbing their syllabi of material that touches on those topics, because those topics are the areas in which [they] could be perceived as engaging in unwanted verbal conduct of a sexual nature,” said Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk, whose writings on the challenges of teaching rape law are quoted in the report. “As long as the standard that is being used looks at whether the act is regarded as undesirable or offensive, then of course anything that one teaches having to do with sex or sexuality can be regarded as undesirable or offensive.”
The AAUP is a national organization of professors and academics focused on advancing free speech and shared governance. It has chapters on 450 campuses, though none at Harvard.
The report also argues that the increasing corporatization of universities, now driven by “consumer-based approaches” and fearful of OCR investigation that could threaten their federal funding, has led to administrative overreach and punitive action against faculty for their work in the classroom.
Samantha K. Harris, director of policy research at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, said schools are afraid that potentially offensive presentations on gender and sexuality in the classroom could lead to expensive external investigation.
“If OCR would issue guidance clarifying that protected classroom speech and protected speech in general does not run afoul of Title IX and will not be the basis of Title IX findings, that fear would be lessened,” Harris said.
The AAUP report similarly suggests that OCR reiterate its interpretation of Title IX as protecting academic freedom, freedom of speech, and due process for both complainants and the accused.
TITLE IX AT THE LAW SCHOOL
The concerns raised in the report have already been the matter of extensive debate on Harvard’s own campus. In 2014, 28 professors at the Law School called for Harvard to withdraw a new set of Title IX policies that, among other changes, used the “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” standard to define sexual harassment and instituted a new “preponderance of evidence” standard to determine guilt in disciplinary proceedings. The professors argued that the University’s new policies “inappropriately expanded the scope of forbidden conduct” and “violate[d] its own finest traditions of academic freedom and faculty governance.”
Many Law School faculty members took issue with the “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” standard, arguing, like the AAUP report, that the definition could endanger academic inquiry on topics of human sexuality, including rape law. The school’s faculty later voted to adopt its own set of procedures around investigation of sexual harassment allegations.
In a “Frequently Asked Questions” document released last fall, Harvard’s Title IX Office clarified that when determining whether offensive speech creates a hostile environment, it “assesses the effect of the speech on the environment from the perspective of an objective, reasonable person, bearing in mind that the University encourages free and uninhibited speech and inquiry.”
For Suk, the Law professor, the clarification came as a “huge relief.”
“I hope that the faculty will shift after this initial phase away from thinking of themselves as potential targets of sexual harassment accusations, to people who can really help change the campus culture for the better,” Suk said.
‘A NON SEQUITUR’
Not everyone agrees entirely with the report’s findings. Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who studies higher education law, said it was conceivable that the guidance coming from OCR, though confusing to work with, had no issues and that schools were simply misapplying it.
“Will people do things with their Title IX systems that aren’t really ideal?” Lake said. “Yes, they will, that’s true with any court or grievance system… but it’s a non sequitur to draw the conclusion that because people may struggle to follow guidance that the guidance is axiomatically defective because of that—it might be, but it might not.”
Brett A. Sokolow, president and CEO of The NCHERM Group, a risk management consulting and law firm that works with universities on Title IX compliance argued that the cases in the AAUP report were entirely the result of errors of interpretation on the part of universities. He said that, even though the report may have correctly identified concerns with academic freedom and due process, it gave an incorrect and misleading diagnosis.
“Left and right, colleges and universities are misapplying due process standards, misapplying first amendment protections,” Sokolow said. “And so that to me speaks to a need to training, and a need for clearer standards from OCR, and for better guidance.” In particular, Sokolow called for tighter and more uniform policies around sexual harassment, nationwide.
Sokolow added that more faculty governance, which the AAUP report calls for, was not necessarily the solution, noting that he was concerned that a too-powerful faculty could stand in the way of Title IX compliance or become invulnerable to sanctions for its own sexual misconduct.
Scott D. Schneider, a professor at Tulane University who leads the Higher Education Practice Group at the law firm Fisher & Phillips, said the AAUP report’s findings could be a sign that intervention by the Department of Education in higher education has gone from one extreme—from deference to decisions made by universities before the 1970s—to another.
“You sort of wonder, has the pendulum swung the other way?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although often sweet, berries proved more tart at the Undergraduate Council’s Sunday meeting, when the small fruits stirred a large debate over responsible funding and budgetary priorities.
On Sunday, Freshman Class Committee Treasurer Scott Xiao ’19 introduced legislation to appropriate $850 to Harvard University Dining Services for a “Berry Brain Break” on Tuesday, as part of this week’s Freshman Health Project. The legislation proposed funding an assortment of strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries to feed about 400 students.
“Our constituents say they want to see berries at our enhanced brain break,” Xiao said.
When the berry legislation first went before the Freshman Class Committee, eight voted to pass it and four opposed it. That split vote, it seemed, predicted a more contentious debate at the Council’s general meeting.
Several representatives argued that given the Freshman Class Committee’s $10,000 budget, spending close to 10 percent of annual funds on berries for a single night would be a misuse of Council funds. Oak Yard representative Olu Oisaghie ’19 called such an allotment “irresponsible.”
Leverett House representative Jullian A. Duran ’18 said “there are definitely other foods that are healthy that don’t cost $850.”
“This didn’t feel like the best appropriation of money,” Oak Yard representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said at the meeting, explaining his opposition to the berry bill when the Freshman Class Committee debated it. “In my mind, it felt like we could spend money in different ways… that might be slightly more meaningful.”
Other representatives criticized the Council’s tendency to pass legislation as a general body without careful scrutiny.
“A lot of times we come here, and it’s just ‘unanimous consent,’ we pass things pretty quickly. But this is quite a large portion of our spending, and I want to make sure it gets taken seriously,” Crimson Yard representative Jack Kelley ’19 said.
But for representatives who supported the legislation, the berries could be a rare treat for freshmen who craved the fruits.
Some representatives pointed to survey results that indicated that berries were popular among freshmen and argued that the committee still had close to $2,000 in its budget remaining for the rest of the school year.
Others, however, were not sold on the alleged popularity of berries.
“I hear people talking about how a lot of their constituents are so excited to have berries at brain break. I’m not sure we have the same constituents,” Oisaghie said.
Still other representatives debated the definition of berries and their availability at brain break.
Winthrop House representative Vimal S. Konduri ’17, a Crimson news editor, said that “technically, there are berries at every brain break, because botanically, bananas are berries.”
After a lengthy debate, the Council ultimately voted to pass the bill. Of the 34 representatives in attendance, 24 voted in favor of the legislation, while five opposed it and five abstained.
“Hundreds of people will have berries that they otherwise wouldn’t have had,” Freshman Class Committee Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said before the vote.
Later in the meeting, the UC continued debate over responsible funding while discussing finances for the third grants pack under the Council’s new “Grant for an Open Harvard College.”
This week’s grants pack proved particularly contentious, as former UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 criticized the Council’s Executive Board for introducing the legislation without going through a committee first. Under the UC’s constitution, legislation must be proposed by a committee first before reaching the whole Council for a vote.
Steinberg-Otter argued that “trying to circumvent the committee process” prevents legislation from receiving scrutiny and input from Council members outside of the Executive Board. Boucher and Duran expressed similar sentiments.
“I just don’t know if due diligence is really being done,” Duran said.
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 defended the legislation, citing UC precedent and noting that the Council had previously voted to place the grant under the Executive Board’s purview. Banks also suggested that a constitutional amendment to allow the Executive Board to introduce legislation may be forthcoming.
Steinberg-Otter also raised concerns with the Executive Board’s decision not to fund the “Senior Outdoor Reflection Trips,” a series of camping trips designed to allow senior to reflect on their undergraduate experiences. The program applied for the new UC grant that provides funding for projects that focus on mental health, social spaces, race relations, or sexual assault and harassment.
According to the meeting agenda, the project was denied funding because the Executive Board did not “think it addresses the compelling interests because these students are leaving campus.” Banks also said the organization failed to provide a clear budget or curriculum for the project.
Although Steinberg-Otter introduced an amendment to allocate $3,000 in funding to the project, the amendment failed to pass with nine votes in favor and 19 against, and seven abstentions. Banks said the Executive Board may reconsider the organization’s request for funding in next week’s grants pack.
Ultimately, the Council voted to pass the $13,975 grants pack through the Open Harvard College grant, in addition to $10,785 in regular Finance Committee grants to student organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 4, 2016, at 7:20 p.m.
More than two years after she wrote an anonymous op-ed in The Crimson criticizing Harvard’s response to sexual assault on campus, a recent Harvard graduate will publish an essay again calling on the University to better combat sexual assault on campus.
Publicly discussing the 2014 op-ed under her own name for the first time, Ariane Litalien ’14 said she will publish an essay titled “Dear Harvard: This Fight is Not Over” as part of a forthcoming collection called “We Believe You: Survivors of Campus Sexual Assault Speak Out.” Her 2014 op-ed “Dear Harvard, You Win,” about Harvard’s response to sexual assault, galvanized campus dialogue and earned national headlines.
In an interview, Litalien said she hopes the new essay will spark more national debate about campus sexual assault in a way that anonymous essays cannot.
“It was really great to get to publish ‘Dear Harvard, You Win.’ It was really empowering and it made such a big difference in my life,” Litalien, a former Crimson design editor, said. “But I wanted to make sure I wasn’t this static, anonymous figure that had written this one op-ed and I wanted to engage in the national debate on this issue.”
Litalien said she began working on a piece for the essay collection after she was interviewed for “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary released last year about sexual assault at colleges and universities, including Harvard. Although Litalien’s interview did not make it into the film, which misrepresented statistics on instances of reported sexual assault at Harvard, she said Andrea Pino and Annie Clark, two women featured in the film, asked her to contribute to the book. 
In her essay, which she shared with The Crimson, Litalien describes her experience writing the Crimson op-ed and the reaction it received on campus and across the country.
Litalien describes her continued struggle with depression and anxiety since she left campus, writing that the day her anonymous op-ed came out remains “the best day” of her life because of the support she received. In her most recent essay, Litalien calls on Harvard to more effectively prevent sexual assault on campus.
In particular, she criticizes Harvard’s sexual assault policy for not including an affirmative consent clause. University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides has repeatedly defended Harvard’s policy, arguing that the current definition of consent provides for a more holistic consideration of sexual assault and harassment.
Since Litalien published her anonymous op-ed, Harvard has overhauled its sexual assault procedures. A few days after Litalien published her story, University President Drew G. Faust announced the creation of a task force dedicated to studying sexual assault prevention.
Later that spring, the United States Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation into Harvard College’s compliance with the anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. In her essay, Litalien says that she became one of complainants involved in the investigation, which remains ongoing.
More than concrete administrative change, though, Litalien says she hopes her Crimson op-ed inspired other people to come forward and discuss their experiences of sexual assault.
“When people tell me they have spoken up about their assault or they are inspired by my story—because I came forward—that means just as much as any concrete changes on campus could mean to me,” Litalien said.
Litalien’s new essay comes as sexual assault prevention remains the center of campus discourse. In March, the task force on the prevention of sexual assault released its final report, which mandates annual sexual assault prevention training for every Harvard student and calls for the creation of a new administrative position in the provost’s office, among other changes.
The book,“We Believe You,” is scheduled to be published on April 12.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School administrators amped up security and amended school policies in response to an escalating debate about free speech that began with a confrontation over posters last week.
Students in the group Reclaim Harvard Law have occupied the Caspersen Center Student lounge—which they are calling “Belinda Hall”—since February to advocate for increased support for minority students on campus. Last Monday, third-year law student William H. Barlow, a vocal critic of Reclaim Harvard Law, posted signs in the lounge comparing the group to Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, a move activists saw as offensive. Reclaim Harvard Law members removed the signs and told Barlow that they had  jurisdiction over what could be posted in the space.
Barlow considered their action a violation of his right to free speech, and returned to the lounge each day for the remainder of the week to post signs with messages such as “Stand Against Censorship, Stand Against Reclaim.” Tensions flared Friday as a group of activists confronted Barlow while he affixed signs to the walls in a stand-off Barlow described as “volatile.”
The school filmed activities in the room Friday to ensure that students were complying with the policy outlined in their emails. Activists said they identified several undercover Harvard University Police Officers masquerading as admissions officers stationed in the hall watching Friday’s dispute play out.
“At the request of Harvard Law School administrators HUPD assigned two plainclothes officers on a paid detail assignment due to safety concerns,” Officer Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email.
The dispute also prompted administrators to revise the school’s poster policy, which states that authorized student groups are only allowed to place posters on designated bulletin boards—meaning that both Reclaim Harvard Law and Barlow were violating school rules.
But on Friday, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow sent an email to students amending the policy to establish the student lounge as a free speech zone open to all viewpoints.
“We will continue to make the WCC lounge available as a temporary space for the community to engage in speech,” she wrote. “But that space must be available to all who wish to use it for such expression.”
The morning after Minow sent her email, members of Reclaim Harvard Law entered the lounge to discover that several of their posters had been defaced with the words “stop censorship.” Since spring break, activists have not been sleeping in the hall and did not see the vandalism occur. Administrators declined to say whether they had identified the perpetrator. Several months ago, the school installed video cameras in Wasserstein Hall after a racially-charged incident of vandalism, but administrators did not place cameras in the adjacent lounge.
Barlow publicly denied any involvement in the vandalism in a post on his Facebook page. Reclaim Harvard Law expressed disappointment about the incident, but did not accuse any particular student.
Administrators have warily watched the events develop over the past week. Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells observed students debating in the lounge on Friday afternoon, and earlier that day, Minow herself visited the lounge. In her Friday email, she reminded students of the school’s policy against threats and violence.
In an email to Law School affiliates Friday, Minow warned that interfering with other students’ posters would trigger disciplinary proceedings. Sells reiterated this message following the vandalism incident Saturday.
“The Dean's statement yesterday made clear that defacing a sign posted by another is in the same category as removing or moving someone else's sign,” Sells wrote in an email to students. “The wall space in the lounge is to be shared, on equal terms, by all members of our community. Matters are being referred to the Administrative Board as appropriate.”
Amidt all of the discussion about the pragmatics of poster placement and removal, a broader debate about the meaning of free speech and inclusion has emerged.
Activists said they can control speech in the room because they are occupying the hall and designating it a make-shift office of diversity and inclusion. Therefore, they argue, they have the right to remove signs they consider to be offensive.
“This is a place made for inclusion. Inclusion doesn’t mean that you let everything that anyone wants go up,” Bianca S. Tylek said. “Inclusion means protecting from exclusion.”
Activists have launched their own postering campaign under the premise “free speech is not neutral,” arguing that the Law School has historically silenced minorities and Barlow’s campaign about free speech is an attempt to stifle conversation about their demands.
“All of a sudden this is a distraction from that,” Reclaim Harvard Law member Titilayo S. Rasaki said. “To change the conversation...[is a tactic] that has been deployed at this institution and schools around the country to silence the voices of students of color when they are challenging substantively what’s going on in their institutions.”
Barlow and supporters, however, view the lounge as a public space where any student has the right to express their views freely. In their opinion, activists’ attempts to regulate signage amount to censorship.
Students have taken to the pages of the Harvard Law Record to weigh in on the debate. The poster dispute has soured several students on the Reclaim Harvard Law movement, which they say they initially supported but now disapprove of activists’ tactics. Marlen Thaten called the movement “authoritarian” in a Record piece, and third-year Law student Stephen M. Silva said activists’ tactics have created a “pervasive” silencing effect on dissenting speech at the school.
“They decided they’re going to stifle, basically, any other ideas people are going to say,” Silva said in interview. “I think it’s very unfortunate because they have some very good ideas.”
Barlow has said he will likely stop mounting signs, as he feels he has made clear his argument. Activists, on the other hand, said they are looking to broaden their postering efforts. Because administrators adopted “Belinda Hall” as a temporary free speech zone—using the boundaries activists had drawn for their occupation—Tylek said Reclaim Harvard Law might expand its physical reach.
“Perhaps we will think about redrawing our lines,” Tylek said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In rainy and slightly colder than normal temperatures, the Harvard men’s and women’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams got back to work for the spring season, hitting the water for early morning races this past Saturday.
MEN’S HEAVYWEIGHTS
The No. 6 heavyweight team opened the 2016 season on the road, taking on No. 7 Cornell and George Washington on Cayuga Lake in Ithaca, N.Y. The Crimson and the Big Red had met in head-to-head competition only 12 times before this meeting, with the Crimson taking home the win in five consecutive years. This year was no different, with Harvard extending its series lead to 9-4.
Though there was a slight tailwind that built up over the course into a stiff wind, Harvard powered through to win three of the five races.
“We thought it was going to be a big tail wind, which would make the boat feel lighter and faster, so we were prepared to change our stroke a little bit to take advantage of that,” sophomore Jack Kelley said. “There really didn't end up being much wind for my race, but there was for the other boats, and they handled it well.”
The day began with the Varsity Eights race. The Crimson, led by seniors James Croxford, and  Achim Harzheim, sophomores coxswain Cole Durbin and stroke Conor Harrity, crossed the finish line at 5:41.7, nearly five seconds ahead of Cornell, which finished at 5:46.3, and 11 ahead of George Washington, which stopped the clock at 5:52.5.
The second varsity boat, coxed by sophomore Jacqueline Goodman and stroked by freshman Liam Corrigan, won its race with the fastest time of the day, finishing with a time of 5:38.5, besting both Cornell and GW by open water.
The 3V boat also won, rounding out the Crimson wins of the day.
“The team did great,” Kelley said. “We're lucky to have such a deep team where everyone challenges each other to be better in practice. When we line up to race another team, we use the experience of racing each other.”
MEN’S LIGHTWEIGHTS
Over in Cambridge, the men’s lightweights raced against Boston College, Bates, and UConn in its first race of the 2016 season. The Crimson swept its competition, claiming first place in every race of the scrimmage.
The V8 boat finished at 6:17.9, five seconds ahead of the second place finisher, Bates, while the 2V and 3V boats both won by open water. The freshman eight boat also made a splash, winning over Bates by just under four seconds with a time of 6:56.7.
RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHTS
Also on the Charles was the No. 17 Radcliffe heavyweight team, which came into the race against Dartmouth and No. 1 Brown fresh off a strong showing in the Beanpot that included bringing home the trophy. With this momentum, the Black and White hoped to win for the first time in seven meetings against the Bears as well as extend its win streak against Dartmouth.
“We were definitely ready to get the season started,” sophomore Katherine Playfair. “We had done a lot of great work over winter break, put in thousands of meters both on, and mostly off, the water, and we were eager to see it pay off.”
Radcliffe ended the day taking second place, after nabbing the second spot in four of the five races.
Like the men’s team, the women’s heavyweights races were affected by the weather. The boats faced a quartering headwind and rain, but relatively calm waters.
The first race of the day was the V8 race. The Black and White boat, coxed by sophomore Katie Felsheim and stroked by freshman Raf Stalph, kept up with the top-ranked team for the first 1000 meters, but the Bears pulled ahead to finish 6:51.1, nine seconds ahead of Radcliffe, which stopped the clock at 7:00.7. The Big Green finished the race 23 seconds later, at 7:23.7.
In the 2V race, Radcliffe was behind and ahead of its opponents by open water. Dartmouth pulled away after 500 meters, and could not be caught. It finished at a fast 6:54.9, 15 seconds ahead of the Black and White’s time of 7:09.2.
The varsity four B and third varsity boats also placed second in their races, finishing with times of 8:20.6 and 7:49.6. The varsity four A boat was the only one to finish third.
“Most of our boats were proud of their performance but eager to make improvements for next weekend,” Playfair said. “We can’t be satisfied given that none of our boats won first place, so we will continue to find more speed. It’s important that every teammate pushes themselves to be the fastest they can be this spring, no matter what it takes.”
RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHTS
Like the heavyweights, the No. 2 Radcliffe lightweight team went into its race coming off of a solid start to its 2016 season in which it took back the Class of 1999 cup. With last week’s win, a strong dual race record—since 2012, the team has won 21 of 22 contests, and has a 1-0 record this year—and a home advantage, Radcliffe was ready to take on Georgetown.
Despite the weather, the Black and White did just that, winning both races to take the Class of 2004 cup.
The V8 squad, coxed by freshman McKenzie Parks and stroked by senior Naomi Lang, and 2V boat, coxed by sophomore Electra Lang and stroked by junior Serena Blacklow, raced together against the Hoya’s V8 boat, with both defeating Georgetown by open water. The V8 boat claimed first place with a time of 7:11.6, the 2V boat finished at 7:27.2, and Georgetown stopped the clock at 7:42.5.
The Black and White 4V boat, coxed by sophomore Jacqui Epstein, raced to a 8:44.2 finish, 15 seconds ahead of Georgetown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a five-match winning streak that spanned spring break, the Harvard women’s tennis team (10-8, 0-2 Ivy) fell to Cornell (12-7, 1-2 Ivy) and Columbia (13-4, 3-0 Ivy) this past weekend at home. Its recent success in California over the break included victories against multiple non-Ivy teams—Providence, Rhode Island, Loyola Marymount, UCSB, and Fresno State.  However, the Crimson was unable to carry the momentum home for its first two Ancient Eight matches.
“It was definitely a tough weekend,” junior June Lee said.  “I think all Ivy teams are going to be tough matches because it really comes down to a few points here and there, and I think that’s arguably what it came down to against Cornell and Columbia.”
NO. 37 COLUMBIA, 4, HARVARD, 3
Taking on arguably the Ivy League’s toughest team, Harvard fell to Columbia in a match at the Murr Center on Saturday afternoon.
“Columbia is the best in the league right now,” freshman Sabrina Xiong said.  “However, we almost had it and I think that that shows we are at their level and can definitely beat them next time.”
Unlike its previous game against Cornell, the Crimson did not prevail in the doubles category, forfeiting the point to Columbia.  The top pairing of Xiong and sophomore Annika Ringblom fell in a 6-1 loss. Likewise, the No. 3 pairing of sophomore Nikki Kallenberg and freshman Isabel Jasper fell, 6-3.
The Lions secured victory after winning the days first three singles matches. However, the final three softened the blow as Harvard managed to reduce its margin of defeat.
Harvard’s No. 4 Ringblom topped Columbia sophomore Alexandra Solovyev, avenging her loss to her in doubles, in a 6-2, 6-1 victory.  In a closer singles match, No. 5 Xiong managed to prevail over her Lion counterpart in a 6-2, 7-6 victory.  In the final match of the day, captain  Amy He sweetened the taste of defeat for the Crimson in the fifth spot, sweeping both sets, 6-0, 6-0.
“Against Columbia, we did better than expected and it really just came down to a matter of one singles match,” Lee said.  “We just need to keep practicing hard this week to pick up the wind for our matches against Penn and Princeton.”
CORNELL, 4, HARVARD, 3
Harvard dropped its first Ivy League match of the season in a close 4-3 contest against Cornell on Friday night.
“I think we did a really good job handling our first Ivy League match this weekend,” freshman Sabrina Xiong said.  “I was extremely nervous, but we all played really well and, even though we lost, that definitely showed in our performance.  I think we’ve certainly improved since the beginning of the season”
The team started off strong with twin victories in the doubles category to secure the all-important doubles point.  The top pairing of Lee and freshman Erica Oosterhout attained the first victory of the day, beating its opponents in a 6-1 match.  In the No. 2 doubles pairing, Xiong and  sophomore Annika Ringblom bested the Big Red, walking away with a 6-4 victory.
The Crimson failed to translate its momentum into the singles play, allowing Cornell to clinch four out of the six matches. Nevertheless, the two Harvard athletes who won the singles victories for the team had also been the victors in their respective doubles events—Oosterhout, playing from the third position, defeated Cornell’s sophomore Lizzie Stewart in a 6-3, 6-1 match, and Xiong, got the upper hand against the Big Red’s senior Jane Stewart in a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 match from the fifth slot.

Exactly one week after its men’s counterparts posted a comfortable 18-8 victory over Dartmouth, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team looked for similar success as a Big Green squad once again came to Cambridge. A comparable scoreline was unlikely, as both squads entered Saturday with the same record, both overall and in conference, and Dartmouth was coming off an impressive win over No. 16 Penn.
From the opening whistle, however, the Crimson was in control. The first half became a back and forth battle not between the two teams, but rather the Big Green and Harvard sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn. She answered each of Dartmouth’s three goals in the period with one of her own, and added two more to singlehandedly outpace her opponents, 5-3, in the first 30 minutes.
Three other Crimson players also found the back of the net to make the score at halftime 8-3. From then on, it was smooth sailing, as the Big Green did not pull within four goals again and ultimately lost, 17-9.
“Every game is important, but being able to win by a significant margin against an Ivy team and at home is always an amazing feeling,” Glynn said.
With the win, Harvard (6-3, 2-1 Ivy) is now back on track in conference play after suffering a nail-biting defeat to No. 10 Princeton last weekend. Dartmouth (5-4, 1-2), meanwhile, continues its road struggles, falling to 0-4 in true away games. The team, however, is still undefeated at home and when playing in neutral sites.
Despite being less dominant at home, sporting a 1-2 record in such contests, the Crimson came out strong in rain-soaked Harvard Stadium on Saturday. Glynn set the tone with her first two goals, both of which were unassisted.
In both instances, she dodged multiple defenders to find space before firing a shot past Big Green freshman goalie Charlotte Wahle. One was from the right half of the field, while the other was from the left, quickly establishing the Crimson’s ability to score from all angles.
After Glynn scored twice to hand Harvard its first lead of the game, 2-1 at the 23:12 mark of the first half, Dartmouth junior midfielder Taryn Deck answered with a goal of her own. Glynn then delivered an even better response, helping her team score three times in the span of four minutes to seize a lead it would not let go of.
Glynn assisted on goals by junior attackers Maeve McMahon and Marisa Romeo, and also tallied one more of her own during the stretch. Glynn continued her strong performance throughout the rest of the game and finished with six goals and four assists, both season highs.
“Offensively, everyone was working together,” Glynn said. “Each person had a role in creating the big lead, whether it was making space for a dodge, setting a pick off ball, or timing a cut for the feed. It's a great reward for the hard work done by the defense when we put our shots away.”
Romeo also had one of her best performances this year, matching season highs with four goals and three assists. She did most of her damage in the second half, helping the Crimson add on to its lead.
“Julia and Marisa have been huge reasons for our success so far this season,” Harvard co-captain Audrey Todd said. “Their ability to get to the cage and also use their vision to find cutters really helps us a lot on offense.”
The team as a whole improved following the intermission, even though it had already seized a large lead. After outshooting the Big Green, 16-11, in the first half, the Crimson continued to pile on the pressure and outshot its opponents, 21-10, in the second.
Glynn and Romeo scored more than Dartmouth on their own, but Harvard also saw four other players combine for seven goals. The squad was bolstered by a strong showing by co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis as well, as she finished with six saves.
For the Big Green, senior midfielder Jaclyn Leto led the charge with three goals, but her team as a whole lacked the offensive firepower to stay in the game.
“With only four teams making the Ivy tournament at the end of the season, we knew this was a big matchup,” Todd said. “Fortunately, we were able to get our offense rolling and execute our gameplan and come out with the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team continued its sevens schedule this past weekend at the Quinnipiac Sevens Tournament in Hamden, Conn. The eight-team field included West Chester, AIC, Dartmouth, Norwich A, Norwich B, Quinnipiac, and Army. The Crimson went 3-2 on the day, going 2-1 in pool play before losing to Quinnipiac in the semifinals. The team would go on to beat the Norwich A squad in the Cup Consolation game, taking third at the tournament. Harvard has made it to at least the semifinals of every tournament this season.
“I’m thrilled with the team’s improvement from each tournament,” head coach Sue Parker said. “The team has had significant improvement in all facets—in execution of skills under pressure... in terms of their understanding and implementing of the gameplan, and also in their ability to manage the game as [it] is winding down.”
HARVARD, 17, NORWICH A, 5
Just last week, junior Claire Collins and senior Lydia Burns were elected the the inaugural women’s rugby All-American team. In her first tournament since, Collins sealed the final game for the Crimson to take third place. Halfway through the second half, Norwich scored to bring the game within one try at 10-5. However, Collins scored a final try off of a penalty to win the game, 17-5.
In the first half, freshman Caitlin Weigel and sophomore Dalton Youngblood each scored a try to make the game 10-0 at half. Both players had been finding the endzone frequently throughout the day. Youngblood led the team with six tries while Weigel had four. The underclassmen on the team tallied 12 of the team’s 14 scores on the day.
“It’s been really awesome having a bunch of underclassmen that are very strong,” sophomore co-captain Maya Learned said. “[The upperclassmen] are the leaders, the playmakers on the field. They might not be the ones who score the tries, but they are the ones who are setting those people up for every try.”
AIC, 10, HARVARD, 7
After going into halftime down 5-0, Harvard came out strong in the second half. Weigel scored the team’s first try of the day early in the second half, putting the Crimson up 7-5 after a successful conversion. The Crimson defense held strong until the final minutes as the Yellow Jackets punched in the go-ahead try.
HARVARD 25, ARMY 5
The Harvard offense found its legs early in the second pool play game. Fueled by Learned, Youngblood, and senior Aniebiet Abasi, the Crimson scored three tries early to go into halftime up 15-0. The onslaught continued in the second half as Weigel found the endzone two more times, extending the Crimson lead to 25. Army scored in garbage time to end the game 25-5. The win was Harvard’s first against Army.
HARVARD 22, NORWICH B, 0
Last weekend, Harvard gave up 10 points in pool play while scoring 86. Against Norwich B, the dominance continued. For the sixth time this season, the Crimson blanked its opponent. The shutout was overshadowed by Harvard’s offensive attack. Youngblood found the endzone three times in the first half, putting the Crimson up 17-0. Learned scored again early in the second half to make it 22-0, advancing the Crimson the the semifinals against Quinnipiac.
“We spend a lot of time in practice on defense, especially on tracking and tackling,” Parker said. “It has to be your bread and butter in sevens, because if you miss a tackle, it’s a score for the other team. If another team scores a try, it has the potential to impact the momentum of the game.”
QUINNIPIAC, 29, HARVARD, 5
Last week at the Crimson 7’s Tournament, Harvard was shut out by Quinnipiac, 48-0. Early in this game, it seemed as if the Crimson could pull off the upset. After going down 7-0, Youngblood successfully drove the length of the field to put Harvard within two. The Crimson was down by only one try at half, 12-5. The Quinnipiac offense was too strong, though, as the hosts pulled away early in the second frame, stringing together three scores to beat Harvard, 29-5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paige Kouba, co-captain of the Harvard women’s track and field team, is no stranger to the Olympic Trials. After all, each year they’re held in Eugene, Oregon—her hometown—and Kouba has attended the last two contests as a volunteer, helping to carry gear for the athletes.
She’ll be attending the upcoming trials, though, in a different capacity.
This past weekend, Kouba—along with sophomore Courtney Smith and senior Autumne Franklin—qualified for the 2016 Olympic Trials at the Florida Relays and Stanford Invitational.
They will be joining freshman Gabby Thomas, who qualified last weekend in the 200 meter dash and qualified again this weekend in the 100 meter dash.
"It was a great weekend,” Kouba said. “Both coasts featured very strong performances from our girls…. [It was] just perfect weather, great meet, and a total blast.”
STANFORD INVITE
Kouba bested the field and the Harvard record in the 3,000 meter steeplechase with a time of 9:50.21, nearly three seconds ahead of the USA Olympic Trial qualifying time and the top time in the country to this point.
Sophomore Courtney Smith also posted the top time in the country—and, more importantly, one of the top eight fastest times in NCAA history—in the 10,000 meter by finishing the race at 32:08.32. Her time bested not only the USA Olympic Trial qualifying standard, but also the International Olympic qualifying standards, set for each games by the International Association of Athletics Federation.
Smith also beat her previous personal record by a whopping 2:45, and beat the old Ivy record by nearly 43 seconds.
“Courtney is 100 percent work ethic and dedication and grit,” Kouba said. “To say that she did well this weekend doesn’t even begin to capture it. She’s got a lot more coming in the future as well.”
FLORIDA RELAYS
On the other side of the country, the Crimson continued its weekend success with another pair of Olympic Trials qualifiers at the Florida Relays
Along with Kouba and Smith, Franklin will also be heading to Oregon this July as a competitor in the 400 meter hurdles, where she took second this weekend in a time of 56.81. Junior Jade Miller claimed fifth in the same race in a time of 57.63.
“Autumne’s been an elite performer at the international level for a long time now, and takes [the sport] very seriously,” Kouba said. “This is our last season in a Harvard jersey, and we both really appreciate how special that is.”
But the Olympic Trial qualifying times did not stop there. Thomas, who last weekend ran the 200 meters in an Olympic Trial-qualifying 23.18 seconds, bested that time by nearly half a second in winning this weekend’s race in a nation-best 22.75 seconds.
Moreover, Thomas also qualified for the Olympic Trials in the 100 meter dash by finishing the race in 11.30 seconds—yet another Ivy record, and the fourth-best time in the nation this year.
“The most exciting part is that you know [Gabby’s] got a lot more to give,” Kouba said. “She’s just a freshman…. I can’t wait to see what’ll happen when she gets settled in here and what the next couple years will bring.”
On the men’s side, sophomore Gabe Montague set a personal record in the 1500 meter, running a 3:48.23 on his way to a 22nd-place finish.
“My goal this season is get to the regional qualifying time, which every year is around 3:45 seconds,” Montague said. “I’m happy about the steps I took the last few meets, and I hope I can keep it going to get there.”
Freshman Myles Marshall also had a successful meet, scoring fifth in the 800 meter run with a personal-best time of 1:48.20.
“We’re really excited about Myles,” Montague said. “He broke his personal record this weekend in the 800, but we think he can go even faster—perhaps even become the first of the men to qualify for the Olympic Trials.”
If so, perhaps there he’ll see Kouba—this time, though, not as a volunteer but as one of the athletes she used to follow around.
“It’s unbelievable. [Qualifying has been] a lifelong dream of mine,” Kouba said. “We got a lot more season between now and [the trials], so for now I’m just kind of focused on the weeks ahead and getting to the Ivy Championships. I’m going to take it one step at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bracing near freezing temperatures, rain, snow, and bouts of gusting wind that caused many events throughout New England to forego any Sunday racing, the Harvard sailing team competed in four regattas over the weekend en-route to producing top 10 results in each of the events.
The fact that the Crimson has produced consistent results like these throughout the spring bodes well heading into next weekend’s New England Team Race Championships at the Coast Guard Academy.
“Overall, I think we did really well…, but his weekend showed we still have work to do, and that we haven’t peaked yet,” sophomore Kevin Coakley said. “[Our] finish at the Marciando is a good omen headed into the New England Championship.”
THE 35TH LYNNE MARCHIANDO TROPHY
In anticipation of Sunday’s forecasted snow and gale force winds, the event’s hosts, MIT, compressed the racing into a fast-paced Saturday. With each team sailing in both Fireflies and turbo FJs, the Charles River basin was crowded to say the least, as all of the 91 individual round robin races were completed on the day.
The compressed schedule, along with the rainy conditions on Saturday, had the potential to cause issues for the sailors, but with Harvard’s most experienced sailors at the helm, the team put forth a concerted effort.
“On Saturday, there were pretty good winds for most of the day and it was actually really nice conditions for team racing,” junior skipper Juan Carlos Perdomo said. “It was unfortunate we were unable to sail [on Sunday], I would’ve been nice to go out again and keep going for more, but all in all I think [the race compression] wasn’t too much of an issue.”
When racing was completed, the Crimson sat in seventh out of the 14 inter-conference schools in the event with its 8-5 record.
“We had a bit of a rough start, but I think we were able to get things together half way through the event,” Perdomo said.  “After we got through the first couple of races…the team was sailing well, making good decisions, and making good plays.  We lost a couple races against some teams we should’ve beat, but we also beat some of the better teams in college [sailing].”
Although rival Yale was able to sweep the field in its first place, 13-0, finish, Harvard’s 8-5 result was more competitive than meets the eye. The Crimson tied fourth place Bowdoin in aggregate record, and Brown and Dartmouth also finished with the same results as Harvard, 8-5, in their respective fifth and sixth-place performances.
CENTRAL SERIES 3
The Crimson hosted it’s own multi-divisional in-conference regatta on the Charles for the first time of the current spring season. The group of young sailors sent to the event represented the hosts well. They collectively put forth a 91-point performance over twelve total races, en-route to an eighth-place finish of the 16 schools in the event.
Racing in FJs, fellow freshman, skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and crew Alejandra Resendiz posted consistent results throughout the weekend, never finishing higher than fourth or lower than seventh in any of the A-Division races. Their 33-point effort was good enough for sixth in the division.
In the B-Division, sophomore skipper Benjamin Zheng and junior crew Zoe Kessler finished in 10th with 58 total points.
BU TROPHY
In this multi-divisional regatta hosted by Boston University, Harvard finished in ninth of the 16 in-conference schools racing at the event. With freshman skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Adam Brodheim competing in the A-Division and fellow freshmen, skipper Andrew Puopolo and crew Lena Episalla in the B-Division, the Crimson posted 62 points in eight races.
Although Harvard sat in fifth place after half of the races were completed, the Crimson was unable to capitalize on its early momentum.  Two finishes outside the top-ten by the B-Division crew helped determine the final result.
Tufts, the eventual champion of the regatta, finished with a total of 36 points aided its B-Division crew finishing in the top two in each of its four divisional races.
CAMEL TEAM RACE
At the only race away from Boston this weekend, a six-person Harvard contingent of freshmen and sophomores, Taylor Ladd, Coakley, Dylan Farrell, Christine Gosioco, Jackson Wagner, and Divya Arya, finished last of the seven schools competing at Connecticut College.
With its 1-7 aggregate record against the other competitors in the FJ team-racing event, the Crimson lagged behind well eventual winner, St. Mary’s College of Maryland, who finished 6-1 on the weekend.
A lack of breeze throughout the day on Saturday and the cancellation of racing on Sunday due to snow and gale force winds led to the schools racing in far from ideal conditions, but the group felt that the event was a learning experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 50 Harvard men’s tennis team (12-10, 0-2 Ivy) traveled to New York this weekend to face Ancient Eight foes No. 55 Cornell (8-10, 1-2) and No. 28 Columbia (13-5, 3-0) to start Ivy League play.
The Crimson was unsuccessful on its road trip to the Empire State. Despite the team’s three game win-streak coming into the match, the Crimson fell short this weekend and suffered two losses.
“Obviously we didn’t have the results that we were looking for this weekend, but I think there was a lot of good tennis played, and a lot of good lessons to be learned,” co-captain Conor Haughey said.
COLUMBIA 4, HARVARD 3
Co-Captain Nicky Hu shined for the Crimson at the Dick Savitt Tennis Center against the Columbia Lions as he helped the Crimson get a 2-0 lead to begin the day. The duo of Hu and junior Brian Yeung won a decisive victory over their opponents, No. 15 doubles partners Columbia juniors No. 64 Shawn Hadavi and Richard Pham, 6-3.
“Nicky came in really big today. He played really well in singles and doubles from what I could see,” freshman Andy Zhou said. “He’s been setting a really good example with his demeanor and competitiveness… that’s just something that the rest of us have to live up to.”
Hu would go on to win his singles match in the top singles spot against Hadavi in straight sets, 6-2 and 6-1.
“We were really fired up about the way that [Hu] competed, and he really went after it. He exemplified what we were trying to do as a team,” Haughey said. “To get on them early and play loose, attack, and stay aggressive.”
Junior Sebastian Beltrame and sophomore Jean Thirouin gave the Crimson a victory in doubles as well, defeating the No. 28 pair of Lions senior Mike Vermeer and sophomore Michal Rolski, 7-5.
Senior Kelvin Lam came back from a first-set deficit, rallying over the next two sets to take a victory over Pham, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. Despite having the doubles point advantage, the Crimson struggled on the singles side, and Lam and Hu were the only successful Crimson players.
Beltrame’s match at second doubles went into a tiebreaker in the third set, and Harvard stayed in close competition with Columbia throughout the day. The players’ efforts were not enough, however, and the Lions bested the Crimson by one point.
CORNELL 4, HARVARD 1
Harvard made the long trip up to Ithaca for its Saturday contest against Cornell. The Big Red overwhelmed the Crimson as a whole, and sophomore Kenny Tao would come out as the only victor for Harvard with a tough three-set victory against Cornell junior Chris Vrabel, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.
Cornell defeated the Crimson back in February in the semifinals in the ECAC Indoor Championships, and the Big Red picked up where it left off.
“The Ivy League is very similarall the teams are very good, but very similar. Whichever team that shows up and competes,” Haughey said. “One day it may go our way and one day it may go theirs, and today it happened to go theirs
The Crimson fell to a disadvantage early on with the loss of the doubles point, something the team has been struggling with throughout the season.
In the singles competition, Cornell had many dominating performances. Senior Stefan Vinti came into the match with a team-leading eight singles victories, and again competed well against the Crimson as he defeated Zhou at fourth singles, 6-4, 6-3. Although Beltrame put up a fight against Big Red junior Colin Sinclair, he ultimately fell 7-5, 6-4.
The Crimson hopes to quickly learn from their mistakes in their losses as the Ivy League season continues.
“It definitely stings, it’s unfortunate to come that close, [and] not come out with a victory,” Haughey said. “There was a lot of good things to come out of it. We’ll take that and learn from it, and hopefully take the anger from the loss fuel us as we head into practice and into next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off its third first-place finish of the season, the four-time defending Ivy League champion Harvard women’s golf team headed to Oxford, Miss., this weekend to take part in the Rebel Intercollegiate. After 54 holes over three days of play, the squad came away in a tie for third with Fresno State.
In addition to escaping the gloomy New England weekend weather, the Crimson was able to see how it matched up against some of the nation’s strongest programs. Other than 14th place finisher Yale, no other Ancient Eight schools were represented in the field of 15. Champion Troy came out of the gates hot and never looked back, shooting an 871 en route to cruising to a 17-stroke victory over host Ole Miss. Harvard and Fresno State were 24 shots off the Trojans’ pace.
“We’re still at that stage of the season where everyone’s game is constantly improving,” Crimson freshman Anna Zhou said. “Most of the Southern schools have been able to practice outside and play in tournaments all winter. Coming down here, we’re able to learn a lot from our playing partners as well.”
At the individual level, Harvard was led by Zhou, whose +2 performance was good for fifth overall. Zhou improved as the weekend progressed, following up a round one 75 with scores of 73 and 70 over the next two days. Junior Anne Cheng chipped in a 222, placing her in a tie for 11th at six over par.
Senior Christine Lin and junior Nina Fairbairn also cracked the top 30, tying for 21st and 30th with scores of 227 and 229, respectively. Also competing for the Crimson contingent over the weekend was freshman Michelle Xie.
“Coming out of spring break, I think we all realized the areas we need to improve on,” Lin said. “We had a good gameplan this weekend to put our skills up to theirs, find out what we need to get better at, and also focus on our strengths.”
Troy’s Fatima Cano walked away with the individual prize with a score of -7, besting Moa Folke of Murray State by five strokes. Cano’s third-round 66 was the lowest score for any player over the three days.
Fellow Trojan Bianca Lohbauer and East Tennessee State’s Loy Hee Ying were the only other players to finish at or below par, ending up in a tie for third place at even par.
The Ole Miss Golf Course, sporting a total yardage of 6,323, played at a par-72 for the invite. Only 21 times were competitors able to put together under par rounds in 268 opportunities, representing a rate of only 7.8%. Of those 21 occurrences, 11 happened on the last day of play.
“Conditions were certainly a bit easier today,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “The wind was less of a factor that it had been previous days, so I think that might be why average scores tended to be a bit lower.”
The Crimson was a model of consistency, holding onto the third position for the duration of the tournament. A first round 301 locked Harvard in at +13 after day one, behind only Troy and East Tennessee State. Firing a score of 300 in round two left the top three spots unchanged, as Troy and ETSU were more than up to the task.
The final day of play shook things up a bit.
The Bulldogs came into Sunday tied for sixth with Tulsa before shooting a 286 propelled them up the leaderboard, leaving their total score identical to the Crimson’s. The Rebels matched this accomplishment, climbing from fourth to second.
“This amounted to pretty much our first event of the spring season, so to have the scoring coming along how it did is a nice confirmation of what we’re working on and perhaps a little bit ahead of schedule,” Rhoads said. “But the players definitely aren’t completely satisfied. They don’t feel they’re hitting on all cylinders yet.”
Rounding out the top ten were Memphis, Western Carolina, Murray State, and Southern Miss. Next week the Crimson heads to the River Landing Classic in Wilmington, N.C. for what will be its final tune-up before the Ivy League Championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team began its 2016 Ivy League campaign the same way it ended last season’s. The Crimson (7-14, 0-4 Ivy League) dropped all four games of its weekend series, falling to Cornell (8-9, 2-0) on Saturday before dropping both contests to Princeton (10-11, 4-0) the following day.
“For whatever reason, we didn’t really have it this weekend,” captain Matt Sanders said. “We struggled pitching, we didn’t swing the bats well. I guess that’s what happens with that is you come back up north with four losses under your belt.”
PRINCETON, 14, HARVARD, 5
Harvard suffered its worst loss of the weekend in its final game. A four-run fourth inning and a seven-run sixth propelled the Tigers to the doubleheader sweep.
Junior first baseman Nick Hernandez and senior catcher Andrew Christie, son of the New Jersey governor, combined to drive in nine of the hosts’ 14 runs.
Freshman Kevin Stone was tagged for six runs in two and a third innings while senior Sean O’Neill surrendered five runs while only recording one out.
Sophomore third baseman John Fallon led the Crimson offense with three hits and two runs scored. Fallon leads Harvard with 19 runs batted in this season.
PRINCETON, 4, HARVARD, 1 (SEVEN INNINGS)
Despite only having two hits on the afternoon, Princeton scratched out a win in the day’s first game. Sophomore pitcher Ian Miller walked six batters on the night and surrendered three runs in the first inning and Harvard’s offense was unable to figure out Tigers’ senior righty Cameron Mingo.
The Crimson managed four hits, with its only run coming off a Ben Skinner home run, the second of his collegiate career, in the seventh. Senior Shaun Rubin pitched two and a third perfect innings out of the bullpen.
“It’s [about] encouraging guys to not dwell on everything we did wrong but to look at things we can improve and I think individually everyone’s got something they can work on and then just take the positives out of the weekend,” Sanders said. “I think if we just continue to grow a little bit, we’ll find enough positives to turn this thing around.”
CORNELL, 6, HARVARD, 4
A late charge by Cornell lifted the Big Red to a come-from-behind victory in Saturday’s second game. Harvard jumped out to a 4-0 lead as senior starter Sean Poppen did not allow a hit through the game’s first four innings. The wheels came off in the fifth as a wild pitch and fielder’s choice cut the Harvard lead in half.
Senior catcher C.J. Price homered in the next frame and Cornell took the lead for good an inning later, tagging Poppen and sophomore Dylan Combs for three runs. The top five hitters in the Crimson’s lineup combined for seven hits, but the bottom four could only muster two.
“We lost a couple tough games this weekend, but hopefully we can flip it and spin a couple wins next weekend,” sophomore outfielder Conor Quinn said.
CORNELL, 5, HARVARD, 1 (SEVEN INNINGS)
Harvard starter Nick Gruener quieted the Big Red’s bats for the game’s first five innings, but a four-run sixth propelled Cornell to victory to start the weekend. The junior surrendered just one hit before conceding a single, walk, and hit by pitch before recording an out in the sixth frame..
Junior first baseman Cole Rutherford drove in the decisive run on a single that plated Frankie Padulo. The Crimson offense managed just three singles and a walk. Junior right hander Paul Balestrieri was the winning pitcher, registering seven strikeouts in his complete game to pick up his first victory of the season.
“Every time you lose a game you’re that much more motivated to win the next one and so when you get embarrassed a little bit the first weekend, it’s the perfect motivation to go out there the next weekend and hopefully grab four wins,” Sanders said.

18 days of classes. 31 days left to prep for finals. Less than 41 days before you’re out of here. And while summer is nearly here and you cannot wait to start summer school and internships, there are still a few things (good and bad) that need to be done before all the fun can begin.
First off, if you have not already, finish using all of your BoardPlus. Start buying a Naked juice when you pass by Greenhouse or blow off HUDS and get sushi for lunch more often. Buy your Starbucks drink at Greenhouse or Lamont Cafe instead of Starbucks in the square. Spread out your usage and enjoy it instead of buying 20 granola bars on the last day of the semester and binge-eating them on the plane ride home. You’re living life large, and it’s time to treat yourself.
Secondly, start eating up all of the snacks in your desk drawer (the large tub of Nutella on my shelf gives me an irrational amount of anxiety). Mom’s care packages are not going into storage or back home with you, so now is a good time to start clearing house. Start bringing them to class or your next meeting. Or plan a night in with friends and swap snacks over a viewing of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
Lastly, start catching up on the textbook readings that you put off over the course of the semester because you figured you would get to it eventually. Finals are going to catch you off-guard so it if you get this out of the way you can have a more chill reading period. We know, we know, this is probably not ever going to happen, but we figured we’d be a good parent to you and let you know that this last month also means that big exams are quickly approaching. Another pro-tip: start participating in section so that your TF remembers you as an active discussion contributor instead of the person who online shops for the whole class period.
Follow these few tips and the rest of the semester will go almost as smoothly as your summer job search. Oh wait...
