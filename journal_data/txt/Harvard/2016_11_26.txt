After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 1,000 challenged ballots have delayed a tally to determine whether or not eligible Harvard students voted to unionize, according to Boston's National Labor Relations Board general attorney Gene M. Switzer.
NLRB deputy regional attorney Robert P. Redbord said University officials and union organizers continued to work through the challenges on Tuesday. Votes are challenged at the time of the election and set aside if there are questions about voter eligibility, whether or not the voter submitted his or her ballot at an unassigned location, or whether the ballot matches the name on the list of eligible voters for a given location.
“The actual count will not be starting today,” Redbord said at lunchtime Tuesday.
According to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall, about 3,500 graduate and undergraduate students were eligible to vote in last week’s historic, NLRB-supervised election, which will decide whether the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers—as of now, a union effort comprised of students across the University—will become a recognized union representing teaching and research assistants.
In an email sent Nov. 23 to eligible voters, Director of Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote, “Because this is the first such election, the number of challenge ballots is not surprising.”
In his email, Curran wrote that the process would resume Nov. 29 after the break.
“The University respects the votes cast by students in this consequential election and, along with many others across our community, we are committed to ensuring that the ballots of all eligible voters are counted,” Curran wrote.
An HGSU-UAW Facebook post reads, “We will return to the NLRB next Tuesday to continue addressing the remaining challenged ballots and to continue to ensure a fair process,” and writing that while “a number of board challenges to voters not on Harvard's eligibility list” were resolved, “there are still hundreds remaining.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to continue its current three game win streak, the Harvard women’s basketball team will take on Fairfield Saturday at Lavietes Pavilion for a 6 p.m. tip off.
On a roll, the Crimson (3-1) head into the matchup with wins against Maine, Samford and Boston University. Undefeated at home, their only loss of the season has come at the hands of Minnesota in a high scoring matchup that ended with Harvard down 16, 103-87.
The Crimson are shooting well from beyond the arc as they average 9.8 three-pointers per game, a number that ranks twelfth in the nation. Their long range shooting percentage is also twelfth in the nation at .424.
The Stags (3-2) come into the matchup after a close 72-65 loss to the Rhode Island. Fairfield erased a 17-point deficit from the first half only to fall victim to a Rhode Island 10-2 run early in the fourth. The team’s other loss came to Sacred Heart in the first game of the season while their three wins came against Loyola, the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Mount St. Mary’s.
However, the Stags have two straight road wins this season and a third would be the first time the team has achieved such since the 2007-08 season. The team also has a strong record against Harvard, winning the last four matchups.
Players to look for on the Crimson include freshman Katie Benzan who has led the team in scoring the past two games with 16 against Samford and 22 against Boston University. She represents a strong threat from three-point range having gone 14-24 on the season, a percentage of 58.3. Inside the paint, senior forward Destiny Nunley leads the team in points with 54 this year. She also leads the team in field goals making 22 of 43 different attempts.
For Fairfield, junior forward Samantha Cooper leads the team in three-pointers with 11 of her 29 attempts from beyond the arc. However, senior forward Kelsey Carey leads the team in field goals with 29 finding their way through the rim. As a team, the Stags have outrebounded their opponents by 21 on the season. Fairfield has so far dominated the offensive boards and a successful Harvard team will have to find a way to get these rebounds in order to prevent second attempt shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team will travel to Amherst, Mass. for its first true road game of the season as the Crimson will do battle with Massachusetts on Saturday afternoon (1 p.m., A-10 All-Access). The Crimson is coming off a sloppy home loss against Holy Cross, a team that the Minutemen defeated on the road last Sunday. 
UMass (3-1) will be the first of three Atlantic Ten opponents that Harvard (1-2) will face in an eight-day period. The game will mark the farthest road trip for the Crimson until the team’s clash with Houston on Dec. 23. Beat writer Stephen Gleason highlights three things to watch in Saturday’s Thanksgiving weekend matinee.
OFFENSIVE CONTRAST
The Minutemen enter the contest averaging 79 points per game. UMass boasts a balanced scoring attack led by junior guard Donte Clark, the heart and soul of Derek Kellogg’s young team. Five Minutemen players average in double figures, including sixth man Zach Lewis.
UMass will be the first team Harvard has faced with a true Division I center. Sophomore Rashaan Holloway is 6’11”, weighs 310 pounds, and will be a difficult assignment for senior center Zena Edosomwan and freshman forward Chris Lewis down low.
While Holloway provides size inside, UMass’s scoring is driven primarily by its guards. The Minutemen are adept at getting to the free throw line. UMass averages 26.5 free throw attempts per contest and is making 68.9 percent, right around the NCAA average.
While the Crimson has a size advantage on the wings with sophomore Corey Johnson (6’5”) and freshman Seth Towns (6’7”), it will have to do a better job on the offensive end than it did against Holy Cross on Tuesday. Edosomwan, the team’s leading scorer and rebounder from a season ago, is only averaging three points and four rebounds a game this season.
The Minutemen are holding opponents to 37 percent shooting from the field, including a 29 percent clip from beyond the arc. Ole Miss, the only team that has beaten UMass this season, capitalized on 38 points in the paint and 33 points via free throws. Lewis, Edosomwan, and the rest of the Harvard front court will have to have strong showings in order for the guests to bring a victory back to Cambridge.
TURNOVERS
The Minutemen’s Achilles’ heel through four games this season has been ball protection. UMass is averaging 20 turnovers per contest and conceded 25 points off turnovers to Ole Miss and 24 to Holy Cross. While the Minuteman guards can shoot and get to the free throw line, a key for Harvard will be making sure that they do not get easy shots or to the line in the first place.
The Crimson has struggled on the defense at times this season and has had its fair share of turnovers on the offensive end. Harvard has only averaged five steals per contest this season and turned the ball over 19 times against Holy Cross. The team that wins the turnover battle will likely leave the Mullins Center with the win.
FRESHMAN SHOWDOWN
While Harvard’s highly touted freshman class has seen significant minutes early on this season, UMass boasts its own crop of first-years which has been up to the challenge in key moments thus far. The five-member class was ranked 33rd in the nation by 247Sports.
Kellogg starts two of his freshmen, and two more have seen considerable playing time off the bench. DeJon Jurreau, a shooting guard from New Orleans, is the crown jewel of the class and is averaging 12 points, six assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game. Luwane Pipkins, a point guard who had to sit out last season for academic reasons, is second on this year’s team in both minutes and points per game. Forwards Chris Baldwin and Tryn Flowers have combined to average over 20 minutes per contest off the bench.
The Crimson’s seven freshman have been on the court a lot for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. Five have started at least one game and five have scored in double figures at least once. Amaker’s rotation is by no means set at this point in the season, but it will no doubt include a large proportion of the freshman class. If Edosomwan continues to struggle, look for Lewis and classmate Henry Welsh to keep receiving major playing time.
The strong freshman classes for both teams will help to ensure that this Bay State rivalry will remain competitive for years to come. The Minutemen took the matchup last season and leads the rivalry, 2-1, since Amaker and Kellogg have been in charge.
