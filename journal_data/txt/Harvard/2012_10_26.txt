After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I distinctly remember a moment in sixth grade when I took interest in a Kerry-Edwards ’04 sticker on my history teacher’s desk. I found the paraphernalia so perplexing that I immediately went home and asked my parents a question I will never forget: “How could my teacher possibly be Catholic and a Democrat?”
Growing up, I naively assumed being Catholic meant you were a Republican. Before you laugh at my ignorance, I will say that I had some pretty strong research to back my case. I had participated in a straw poll in second grade, during which only one student would admit that he (read: his parents) supported Al Gore. I went to a Catholic school, and my family went to church every Sunday. We supported Bush. Politics seemed pretty cut and dry.
Aging makes man wiser, and I now realize that nothing is that simple. As I became more interested in the political stage, I was surprised to see how wrong my original assumption was. I discovered the seemingly impregnable nexus between Catholics and the Democratic Party. I found out that historically, most Catholics (and Catholic politicians—Al Smith, John F. Kennedy, and Geraldine A. Ferraro, not to mention Joe Biden, and Kerry himself) belonged to the Democratic Party. My fallacious thinking was based purely on selection bias. Unbeknownst to me, not every Catholic lives in the suburbs and sends her children to parochial school. My elementary school may have taught me many things, but none were about diversity. It took me a long time to figure out that the suburban Catholic demographic is vastly different than the Catholic demographic as a whole. For example, I do not think the notion of an “immigrant” had even occurred to me.
Looking back on my youthful ponderings, I believe I unwittingly sensed the nascence of a national trend. Perhaps better known as “suburbanization,” the trend highlights the historic tendency of Catholics to participate fully in society and, by extension, to fight for the preservation of the institutions that helped them achieve the American Dream.
Despite my incorrect assumptions early on, a look at the panoply of Catholics in the upper echelon of American governance now indicates a general shift toward the GOP. Two of the top four candidates for the presidential nomination were Catholics, as is the vice presidential nominee, the Speaker of the House, and the five Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents. While Catholic Democrats still outnumber their rivals in the Senate, it is worth noting that almost half of the Republicans who came to power in the 2010 “wave election” are members of the Roman Catholic Church.
The trend has created a new tossup demographic, as, losing their connection with the Democratic Party, Catholic voters have become very important in electoral politics. Political strategists on both sides are greedily eyeing the Catholic vote, and they consistently peddle theories designed to justify and predict the trend lines.
One of the most plausible of these is the common theory that the past 20 years have been characterized by increasing Democratic antipathy to Catholic values and social positions. This argument is corroborated by the current lawsuit lobbied against the Obama administration by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops over the government’s mandate that birth control must be offered by insurance plans. A countervailing notion claims that the GOP’s social moderation and the diminishing power of Evangelical Christians within the party attract open-minded Catholics. A third possibility revolves around Catholic anticommunism and the cohort that came of age in the GOP’s golden days during the Reagan Era.
Each of these conjectures likely possesses some grain of truth. They each identify specific reasons why certain subgroups of Catholics may have reconsidered their party affiliation within the past quarter century. Yet they all seem to be missing the broader point. By attributing various explanations for three distinct types of Catholics, the punditocracy is implicitly acknowledging that the Catholic segment of America has finally arrived.
Fifty years ago, the Catholic Church was, politically speaking, nothing more than an interest group. Catholics in the early 20th century were mostly immigrants with the number one priority of feeding their families. This was no easy task in a prejudiced America that expressed a vocal populist sentiment verging on nativism. Catholics could not rely on society, so they relied on each other. Inner-city bosses and machine politicians easily exploited this fact in a successful attempt to cater to a growing voting bloc. Catholics formed powerful unions, like the Knights of Labor, to represent their interests collectively in a society keen on suppressing them. This lasted for decades as Catholics continued to vote along family lines.
That Catholics are now primarily divided between the two main political parties demonstrates an end to the Democrats’ monopoly on one of America’s largest religious denominations. As a quarter of the American population, Catholics are no longer a demographic swayable with pandering and petty promises. As fully engaged participants in this society, they have the luxury of being able to consider their options carefully. Different Catholics may come to different conclusions. At least now that is their choice to make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the heels of Mitt Romney’s most recent campaign gaffe on gender equality in the workplace, a group of students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government have staged a protest against the dearth of diversity among the school’s faculty, asserting that “at least Romney had binders.”
In 1988, a mere 10 percent of HKS faculty was female. In comparison, today’s 27 percent female junior faculty and 19 percent female senior faculty is a noteworthy improvement. Nonetheless, there remain significant structural impediments to women’s advancement in academia. Particularly, the rigidity of the traditional tenure track poses an undue burden on female academics seeking to balance the requirements of family and work. We urge HKS to examine and address its current tenure process to level the playing field.
Significant gender disparity among the faculty at any institution is worrying. There are many ways in which interacting predominantly with male instructors can shape students’ expectations of which careers they can expect to succeed in, and this is particularly relevant to HKS because many of its students will go on to pursue careers in government, a field that remains disproportionately male. It is not unreasonable to suppose that a greater number of female professors at an institution as prestigious as HKS would translate into greater female participation in government across the U.S.
The gender disparity at HKS is especially alarming because of the high profile that gender-related issues hold in contemporary politics. There is perhaps no better testament to this than the prominence of women’s issues in the current presidential and congressional campaigns, where issues like contraception, rape, and abortion routinely take center-stage. Students of government go on to shape policies that touch millions of lives, and the interests of men and women cannot be equitably addressed until all genders are represented equally in government.
That HKS employs a lower percentage of female faculty than its peers suggests that some practice specific to HKS is preventing women from obtaining professorships. Professor Jane J. Mansbridge notes that the Kennedy School’s system of tenure, unlike those of some of its peer institutions, is not particularly accommodating to female academics. We encourage HKS to remain cognizant of the unique challenges posed by the tenure track when raising a family. In a culture where women more often than men are expected to and will raise their families, women continue to bear the brunt of these challenges.
To this end, HKS should examine and consider reforming its system of tenure so that it may be more compatible with the lives of women. A number of universities, such as the University of California, have implemented systems under which tenure candidates can switch between part-time and full-time status. In the same spirit, Princeton University’s track automatically allows faculty extra time to pursue tenure after having a child. Such a system would not only enable more women to pursue tenure tracks rather than poorly paid lecturer positions, but it will also increase the diversity of perspectives and consequently the intellectual productivity of HKS by facilitating the entry of both women and men raising families into tenured professorships.
Though David T. Ellwood ’75, dean of HKS, has commendably doubled the school’s number of tenured female faculty since his appointment in 2004, he has stated that he has “no immediate plans” to continue closing the gap. In light of the national conversation on gender in the workplace prompted by Romney’s campaign blunder of “binders full of women,” we hope that HKS administrators realize the importance of prioritizing gender equality among faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Has Horace Greeley’s famous injunction to young Americans in the 19th century—“Go West, young man”— been revised in the opposite direction in the 21st century? In January, a New York Times op-ed declared: “Go East, Young Man,” and many at Harvard seem to be responding.
Students at Harvard are studying Chinese, spending summers interning in Beijing and Shanghai, and taking coursework on related topics (for example, Michael J. Puett’s course on classical Chinese philosophy is currently the College’s third most popular class, with over 500 enrollees this fall). Everywhere we look, our politicians and our teachers are encouraging us to prepare for a future of engagement with China. In 2009, President Barack Obama pledged to send 100,000 American students to China.
The message couldn’t be clearer. But how do students who are listening to this advice and preparing for careers involving China think about their prospects?
15 years ago, the now-clichéd answer might have fallen relatively neatly into a “passion versus paycheck” binary. One cohort headed to China to work in financial services as foreign capital poured into the country in the 1990s and 2000s (what we could call the “paycheck” group). They often spoke little or no Chinese and had begun working on China late in life. Another group went to China to work at schools and nonprofits (the “passion” group)—experiences vividly described in, for example, writer Peter Hessler’s “River Town.” They often focused on language acquisition and immersive experience in life on the ground in China.
Undoubtedly, exceptions to these broad categories existed—but to a remarkable extent, as I interviewed students for this article, they discussed these two received cultural types as the framework for how they had initially thought about their career options in China. Nowadays, though, the students with whom I spoke told me that this old “passion versus paycheck” distinction is fading. Instead, China’s continued development and the growing interconnection between the United States and China are allowing Harvard students to consider new, high-impact career paths involving China.
Charles G. Gertler ’13 is part of this young generation of Mandarin-speaking Americans who are innovating new forms of professional engagement with China. Before starting at Harvard, he spent a gap year in China, where he worked as an English teacher and learned Mandarin. In college, he developed a strong interest in climate issues and energy policy in China, and he intends to make his career dealing with these challenges.
Last summer, Gertler worked at a state-owned clean energy firm, the China Three Gorges Corporation. As he considers jobs after college, he is excited about the range of consultancies and think tanks that are built on “cooperation between West and East” on climate issues. “The jobs that I’ve seen be open to me have been jobs with institutions that are both Chinese and American or European,” he said, such as the China Greentech Initiative, a “commercial collaborative platform focused on identifying, developing and promoting green technology solutions in China,” and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which has offices in the West and Beijing. These jobs simply do not fit in the “passion versus paycheck” binary.
Instead, Gertler and other students like him said that they think about their decisions from a number of different perspectives. Geography is one obvious factor. “I would rather stay close to home than move to China right now, but China is certainly still my main area of interest,” Gertler said. Other students with primary career interests in China told me that they are looking at jobs in Great Britain, Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia. The jobs that these students are pursuing will place them in locations outside of China but will allow them to work closely on impactful China-related issues.
A more ambiguous factor that many students also emphasized is a company’s national identity. As American students gain better Chinese language skills and a deeper understanding of China, it becomes newly possible to work at Chinese companies or at employers that, as Gertler said, are built around cooperation between China and the United States. Taking these factors together, it is easier to see the novel way that young Americans are thinking about careers engaging with China: to many young Americans, these careers offer exciting possibilities to work with colleagues from diverse national backgrounds in diverse geographies.
Some campus groups and University organizations are facilitating this evolution in thinking about careers in China. The Harvard China Fund is one example. HCF arranges summer internship experiences in Greater China for Harvard undergraduates. They offer a few jobs in finance and a few at NGOs, as well as a variety of options in media, agribusinesses, and healthcare, according to Assistant Director Jennifer Downing. The program has a remarkable reach, with 43 participants in the summer of 2012, and Harvard should continue to develop programs of this kind, including programs for post-college employment.
As interest in careers engaging with China continues to intensify, students, the University, and prospective employers will need to understand and respond to these newly available opportunities. As the dynamic country of “socialism with Chinese characteristics” continues to grow, we may soon find a wave of “careers with Chinese characteristics,” too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent post on The Voice, an anonymous blogger described five types of students one would encounter at a campus recruiting event. Among a few standard college clichés of hipsters, bros, and ass-kissers, the author added a single racial category to the mix: The “indistinguishable,” “sort-of gushy, sort-of whiny” Asians.
The language in The Voice’s piece was nothing new or exciting. It didn’t shock us. It didn’t outrage us. For as long as we can remember, we’ve seen Asian Americans portrayed as lacking in individuality and personality. In much of American society, even among those who are usually quite conscientious about racial language, jokes about Asian Americans are familiar and socially acceptable, and the group has become an easy, permissible target for racial humor. Our experience actively promoting awareness of Asian American issues over our last three years at Harvard should have primed the three of us to react quickly to the controversial post, but even we had become desensitized. After all, no one wants to be that person who can’t take a joke.
But let’s be clear about the type of joke that the blog post actually employed. Satire, which the author claimed as his or her purpose, is defined as the ridicule of human folly and vice. If satire is constructed to lampoon stereotypes or to highlight a group's ridiculous treatment, it both entertains and illuminates a ludicrous aspect of our society. The audience comes away comprehending the absurdity of prejudiced behavior.
In contrast, the blog post on The Voice did not ridicule how common and foolish it is to think that all Asians look and behave the same; instead, the piece just repeated that exact mockery, placing the fool’s cap on the Asian, not the racist. Unlike effective satire, careless racial humor mocks not the irrationality of racism, but the racial group itself. Within the audience, many miss the underlying implications, laugh the joke off, and internalize yet another depiction of Asian Americans as uniformly uninteresting or otherwise unpleasant people.
Let’s provide some context for these racial jokes about Asian Americans. Unlike other minority groups, Asian Americans are expected to keep quiet about prejudice and just appreciate that the “Model Minority” stereotype is a positive image, even if false. Repetition of careless racial humor then plays right into this expectation that Asian Americans won’t speak up, making people comfortable with derogatory depictions of this particular group. As Jasmine Y. Miller ’13 identified to The Crimson, these negative portrayals include the “Perpetual Foreigner” and “the idea of Asians as an non-individuated mass,” both of which were at the root of anti-immigration, anti-miscegenation, and wartime internment policies in 19th and 20th century Asian American history. Today, an environment that still readily, comfortably accepts such perceptions is the foundation for serious and often unaddressed manifestations of modern anti-Asian racism, which include school bullying, workplace discrimination, political exclusion, and racial violence.
We are not asserting that casual prejudices directly result in oppressive policies and discrimination, but they are nonetheless damaging. Viewing Asian Americans as un-American, anti-social, segregated, indistinguishable, and uncharismatic perpetuates our exclusion from boardrooms, politics, and the media. These perceptions hurt us personally as well, for example when we see that our blockmates, teammates, and classmates accept them as nothing more than amusing, or when we realize we must overcome them each time we meet someone with a subconscious pre-conception. So if we ourselves laugh and stay silent, we signal our acceptance of the stereotypes that ultimately damage Asian America’s position in society. We do a disservice to victimized individuals and marginalized groups if we fail, especially in an environment like Harvard’s, to challenge the beliefs exhibited in casual racial mockery.
Given that anti-Asian racism remains a reality for many American citizens and even members of the Harvard community, we encourage our peers to be aware of the underlying issues in the blog post and the campus dialogue that it sparked. This humor piece and the ensuing discussion remind us that the beliefs we hold are incubated during these formative college years. But we don’t have to absorb problematic stereotypes about certain groups of people passively. Instead, our time at Harvard is an opportunity to model the values we want to see in society at large. Let us hold our community accountable for informed and responsible discourse about race. If we are aware of the implications of our words, we can more effectively utilize humor to dismantle racism rather than to perpetuate prejudice.

Scared of rejection? Don’t want to spend another faculty dinner spooning stolen dhall cereal into your mouth alone in your dorm room? Don’t worry, FM’s got your back with a few foolproof proposals to guarantee your professor won’t say “no” or “who are you?"
Slip a Note in Your Term Paper
If you have an essay due for one of your classes, this is the perfect way to ask your professor to the faculty dinner. Not only will it make for a pleasant surprise, but it will also help you reach your page limit. If you want to seal the deal you can even incorporate the invite into your thesis—the faculty dinner has everything to do with democratization in the Middle East.
 Let Him/Her Ask You
Manipulate the situation so that your professor asks you to dinner. Do whatever it takes to be the last one out of lecture. Fumble with your backpack, drop pens and pencils all over the ground, or just stand there awkwardly for a couple minutes. Then, when you’re left alone with the professor, sigh loudly and subtly hint that you have no one to take to faculty dinner. “Oh so it looks like I have no one to go to the faculty dinner with...cough cough. Hey professor, did you hear that?” Your professor should catch on from there, especially if you start weeping softly.
 
 Office Hours
This one is perfect if your TF or professor holds office hours in a cafe. When you go in for office hours offer to buy her a latte or coffee, then quickly write a message on the cup of coffee: “Will you go to the faculty dinner with me? Grande Soy Milk Latte”
 Hijack the Lecture
Time to put those CS50 skills to work. Take over the monitor during lecture, and in big, bold, obnoxious letters, with blinding, flashing neon colors, make your proposal. It couldn’t hurt to throw in some gifs of adorable animals for good measure. It’s sure to give the whole class a laugh, and the professor will be so impressed, he’ll have to say yes!

1) Procrastinate. Spend hours in the library café, dining hall, friends’ rooms—anywhere to distract you from even attempting to get work done. When you finally do sit down in front of your computer, browse Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media sites and blogs ad infinitum. Eventually begin school work sometime after midnight. Convince yourself that you are a night owl: “This is when I get my best work done.
 2) Feel inferior. Tell yourself you’re not smart enough to be here; think everyone else deserves to be at Harvard more than you. Your work is crap. You are crap. Let low grades or a low GPA define you. Let this feeling of inferiority color your world and affect your abilities. Start skipping class and turning in assignments late. Give less than your best because you truly believe your best wouldn’t be good enough anyway.
3) Sleep in—even though you told yourself that today you’d make it to all of your classes. On a good day, wake up around 11:00 a.m. Wake up in the afternoon if you’re feeling too depressed to get out of bed. Only show up to classes where attendance is taken. When present, be absent, not really following along. Feel extreme relief when class is over. Retreat back to bed.
 4) Do all these things in disguise. Joke with friends. Overcommit to extracurricular activities. Pass by acquaintances on the street: Smile, wave, and cheerfully call out, “Hey, let’s grab lunch sometime!” Wish you knew how to ask for help rather than spout meaningless greetings. Wish you had the words to explain. Fear that asking for help would validate your inferiority, not your strength. Perfect the art of barely holding yourself together.
 5) Repeat daily.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cyborg tissue is becoming more than fiction thanks to research by a team of Harvard and MIT scientists who have engineered nano-sized electrical wire scaffolds that can be placed inside living tissue. It’s a technology they hope will become a fundamental part of drug development and aid in replacing damaged tissue in the human body.
Published in “Nature Materials” earlier this year, the scientists built on an idea of merging biological processes in the brain with nanoelectronics developed by Professor of Chemistry Charles M. Lieber, a pioneer in the field of nanotechnology.
“Everything we think about in electronics is built on a chip, so the idea was very simple,” Lieber said. “But we wanted to use the techniques based on 2-D patterning and somehow make it 3-dimensional and mimic what holds our cells together—a type of synthetic scaffolding.”
Ultimately, the researchers believe this technology will be fundamental to the future of drug testing and development. The current drug development process relies on animal testing followed by human trials—a system fraught with ethical and technical issues, said Jia Liu, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, who along with Bozhi Tian and Tal Dvir pioneered this research in the Lieber Lab.
Liu said that major challenges in testing drugs for human use include overcoming the differences between human cells and those of other animals as well as harvesting human tissues. Nanotechnology, he said, could provide a way to monitor how drugs react with tissue samples directly in the lab.
“With nanoelectronics, the electronics are embedded intrinsically inside the tissue and we apply the drug so that we can directly record it from electronics to see how exactly human tissue reacts to certain drug supplies without damaging it.”
According to Lieber, the long-term goal of this research is to implant tissue samples built on nano-electronic scaffolds directly into the human body. In this way, the “cyborg tissue” can replace damaged tissue and connect to humans’ neural networks in the same way that cells connect to each other in natural tissue.
Senior author Robert Langer, a Chemical Engineering professor at MIT, said,“Not only can we create a tissue but we can actually monitor what happens in that tissue.”
“We can imagine making a tissue for someone who is ailing and getting diagnostics to tell you how it’s doing,” he added.
These nanoelectronic scaffolds could even be programmed to deliver drugs internally at the same time that they monitor the tissue’s internal state, according to senior author Daniel S. Kohane,  who is a Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School.
“In theory and hopefully soon in practice we can use these things to stimulate [cells] electrically—or even as drug delivery systems [to] have a desired effect.”

Nature seems able to take care of itself without our help, according to the results of a 20-year study at the Harvard Forest.
The research, soon to be published in the journal “Ecology,” outlines how forests bounce back after sustaining severe damage, independent of human assistance. The scientists studied ecological growth in a two-acre plot where they had pulled down trees to simulate the effect of a major hurricane on a forest in order to see how forests recuperate after natural disasters. The study looked not only at damage to large trees, but also ran experiments to investigate how climate change could affect the activity of microbes in the soil, nitrogen concentration, and plant growth.
The experiment was meant to simulate the damage done by the Great Hurricane of 1938, which toppled approximately 70 percent of the Harvard Forest. After that storm, locals led the biggest forest salvage in U.S. history, removing dead wood that researchers today say could have helped in reviving the ecosystem’s health.
The Harvard Forest study began in October 1990. Trees in the experimental plot were either uprooted or snapped by using heavy machinery, simulating the effects of a major hurricane. Compared to the older approach of chopping down trees and leaving them there, this methodology was a significant improvement, the researchers said.
Surprisingly, damaged trees in the plot not only grew back but fully uprooted trees continued to live and produce leaves for the first few years after manipulation. Within about six years, biomass production in the plot was still lagging but biological processes in the forest were back to normal. This contrasts with prior hypotheses that without human interference, growth would be hindered by pest infestation or fire outbreaks, neither of which posed problems in this experiment. Also striking was the discovery that the “new” forest was again dominated by previously dominant saplings and seedlings, as opposed to less prominent species that had out-lived stronger competitors immediately after the storm.
“The fact that the forest recovered so effectively was not surprising but the way in which it recovered was surprising,” said David Foster, Harvard Forest Director and overseer of the project. “Normally[...]we look at a forest that’s been burned, or a forest that’s been blown down, or an area that’s been flooded as being ruined or destroyed or damaged,” he said.
“But these are, of course, natural processes forests have dealt with forever.”
Audrey Barker-Plotkin, primary researcher on the project, shares Foster’s sentiment.
“It’s very humbling, in a way, to see a forest change before your eyes,” she said. “When you see a forest you love blown down or harvested, it’s really difficult to believe that it will come back.”
Both cited the importance of being able to conduct long-term studies such as this one.
“It’s important to see how critical it is to study ecological processes over a long period of time,” said Foster.
He added that these results have important implications for not only the way in which scientists conduct research in forestland, but also attitudes towards treatment of natural ecosystems at large.
“If we are trying to work with Nature and accomodate and help Nature,” said Foster, “We have to do it on Nature’s terms.”

At first glance, one might not realize that the Alex M. Willis ’14 on the poster of the upcoming Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of “Cabaret” is the same Alex Willis who spends 10 to 15 hours a week conducting cutting-edge chemistry research the lab of Chemistry Professor Theodore A. Betley.
Willis, a resident of Quincy House, has managed to pursue a truly diverse set of interests during his time at Harvard. However, he doesn’t perceive his busy schedule as something stressful to maintain.
“It’s all just a matter of calendar work,” he explained simply. “It’s mainly a time issue, not an interest issue.”
His blockmate Chris J. Masterson ’14 can attest to Willis’ incredible work ethic.
“He’s very dedicated to everything he does, and he definitely never leaves things unfinished,” said Masterson.
When the Chemistry and Physics concentrator is not spending hours choreographing dance pieces and shows like the Harvard Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players' “The Mikado,” he’s in the Mallinckrodt building working on “synthesizing novel multinuclear metal complexes.”
Essentially, Willis is testing metals under different conditions to form new metal structures. While most metals consist of atoms packed in a particular order, Willis is trying to construct new metal complexes with different internal orders.  In particular, he is experimenting with metal cores consisting of six iron atoms fused with two other metal atoms such as copper or manganese. He currently works with graduate student Raúl H. Sanchez, who shared how quickly Willis picks up on things.
“Recently, I was asking him to do a particular filtration. After that, I then went ahead to teach him how to do it when he says, ‘Oh, I know how to do that, I saw another student doing it the other day.’ Sure enough, he knew how to do it,” said Sanchez.
Willis’ adaptable mind is also evident in the way that he was able to smoothly transition from working in a physical organic chemistry lab in Japan this past summer to an inorganic chemistry lab here at Harvard.
“I was just trying different hemispheres of chemistry,” said Willis.
He had spent two months with the Nakamura Group at Tokyo University “combining all the best parts” of previous research experiments to build molecules that could help absorb the energy of sunlight in solar cells. Whereas most solar panels incorporated metal complexes, Willis’ work focused on using organic molecules instead. Through the Japan-U.S. Undergraduate Research Exchange Program, spearheaded by Harvard Physics Professor John M. Doyle, Willis was able to use the experience to discover that he preferred inorganic chemistry to its organic counterpart and returned to Harvard with fresh research ideas.
“Alex is really passionate about what he does, whether it’s staying up figuring out quantum physics problems or dressing up in drag for another performance of the Hasty Pudding show,” said blockmate Dylan J. Nagler ’14.
However, the specifics of his blockmate’s scientific experiments are lost on Nagler.
“I don’t know all that much about what he does inside the lab, although I remember him telling me that he spent the entirety of this past summer in a lab in Japan ‘trying to make something purple,’” he said.
When asked about his goals for the future, Willis shrugged and said, “I know I want to go to grad school for chemistry.”
“I just want to do good research.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While millions of tourists swarm to Brazil each year to experience the lush rainforests and bustling cities, an increasing number are visiting with a different agenda—to receive cosmetic surgery.
Although traveling abroad to receive medical treatment dates back to ancient Greece, the recent influx of “medical tourism” has garnered public attention. In his latest book, “Patients with Passports: Medical Tourism, Law, and Ethics,” Harvard Law School Professor I. Glenn Cohen explores various forms of medical tourism and their associated legal and ethical issues.
“Medical tourism is not the most intuitive topic; it’s a very sophisticated discussion,” said Professor Nathan G. Cortez, Assistant Professor of Health Sciences at Southern Methodist University, who has collaborated with Cohen on his work.
“You’re talking about medicine, law, and international dimensions, which adds up to very difficult but provocative phenomena,” he said.
Cohen’s own investigations were influenced by both increasing media reports and his own personal experience.
“I grew up in Canada, where many Canadians would go across the border to receive MRIs,” he said.
Cohen says that medical tourism has noticeably increased in the past 12 years due to the ease and diminishing costs of travel, increasing healthcare costs, and globalization.
Although patients in Canada may seek treatment abroad to avoid long waiting times, the demographics of medical tourism are evolving and expanding.
“It has usually happened from countries with weaker medical systems, but now there’s a focus in wealthier countries,” said Professor Jeremy C. Snyder from Simon Fraser University, who is currently developing guidelines for Canadian patients considering foreign medical care.
While wealthy foreign patients have traditionally come to the US for perceived higher quality treatment or procedures and technology unavailable at home, patients from the U.S. are increasingly traveling to Mexico, India, and China for cheaper or experimental treatment. Popular cross-border services include cardiac surgery, hip and knee replacement, cosmetic surgery, and stem cell therapy. A standard knee replacement, which costs an average of $45,000 in the U.S., can be performed for $6,500-$13,000 in India.
Cohen’s book, which will be published in late 2013, discusses the two categories of medical tourists: those seeking medical procedures that are legal in their home country, such as coronary artery bypass surgery and hip replacement surgery, and those seeking controversial or illegal procedures including organ sale and abortion.
He also describes the myriad of problems associated with each category, including quality of care, adequate documentation, doctor-patient relationship, and proper patient information.
“I was shocked at the number of parents taking their children abroad for stem cell therapy to treat conditions such as neurodegenerative and other diseases without strong evidence,” said Cohen.
Given the unlikelihood that the pressures fueling medical tourism will abate, Cohen believes it will be important to promote general awareness and knowledge and hopes his book will aid in that effort.
Although medical tourism will likely persist in a regulatory void for the forseeable future, Cohen recommends that countries provide better innovation pathways, more effective methods of organ procurement, and improved cooperation between state and foreign governments in the near term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here are three questions for your weekend reflections. Number one: how many people would it take to build a human pyramid 22 layers tall? Number two: if 23 people in a room shake hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes take place? Number three: what’s the chance that two of those 23 people have the same birthday? And the bonus: how are all of these questions connected?
First things first. Your pyramid has 22 brave Atlases on the bottom, carrying 21 people on their shoulders, 20 more balanced above, and so on and so on, up to the one lucky soul perched at the top. How many people make up this tower? Just add them up, row by row. 22+21+20+…+3+2+1.
Stop that hand drifting to your calculator—there’s a better way. As mathematical legend has it, child prodigy Carl Friedrich Gauss figured out a neat trick when he was just six years old. He decided to think about the numbers he was adding as if they were arranged in a long line, with 1 at the start and 22 at the other end. Now picture folding that line in half, so that 22 pairs with 1, 21 with 2, and so on until you reach 11 and 12, the kink in the middle. You can add numbers in any order, so add up each pair. The numbers make convenient partners—each pair sums to 23. You started out with 22 numbers, which gives 11 pairs, each equal to 23. You and clever little Gauss have made this problem much easier: 11x23 = 253. (That’s a lot of cheerleaders.)
One down, two to go. You’re in a room with 23 people, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. How do we go about counting how many handshakes take place? Here’s one way: arrange everyone in a long, single-file line. Person 1, at one end, goes down the rest of the line, shaking the hand of every other person. At the other end of the line 22 handshakes later, Person 1 is done with handshake duties and leaves the room. Now Person 2 shakes the hand of everyone left. With Person 1 gone, that’s 21 handshakes. And we keep going, with everyone shaking the hand of each person behind them in line, until we have Person 23 at the end, bored to tears and swearing off recruiting events. How many handshakes is that? Well, Person 1 performed 22 handshakes, and Person 2, 21, and so on, until we had Person 22 and 23 at the end. A familiar sum: 22+21+20+…+3+2+1 = 253.
But that’s not the only way to slice up this problem. If everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once, we can also think of handshakes occurring between every possible pair of people. How many pairs are there in a room of 23 people? We have 23 options for the first person and just 22 options for the second, since a person can’t shake their own hand. But handshakes are reciprocal; Romeo plus Juliet is the same as Juliet plus Romeo, which means we’ve double-counted our pairs. So our final number of pairs is this: 23x22/2 = 253. Mathematicians call this counting of pairs “23 choose 2.” We can count pairs for any number of n objects in the same way, which gives us the general formula for “n choose 2”: n(n-1)/2.
What do pyramids and handshakes have to do with birthdays? In a room of 23 people, the probability that two people share a birthday might seem low. There are 365 days! But as it turns out, the chances are pretty high—over 50 percent, in fact. It’s true that any specific pair of people has a low chance of sharing a birthday, just 1/365. But as we just found from our round of handshakes, there are 253 pairs of people in the room! That’s a lot of chances for an unlikely event to occur.
What’s really beautiful about math is how seemingly unrelated problems, like pyramids and birthdays, have deep and fundamental similarities. If you play with simple building blocks like “n choose 2” you will find many unexpected connections—and maybe even a shared birthday.

In an office full of ant models, butterflies in frames, and books on Nabokov, it doesn’t take much questioning to figure out what OEB Professor Naomi E. Pierce’s greatest passion is: entomology. Having conducted research on insects for decades, Pierce’s work warranted the University to build her a greenhouse atop the Museum of Comparative Zoology laboratories. There she keeps ants that hail from all over the world. Rich with stories, Pierce sat down with The Harvard Crimson to share stories about her fear of bugs, her husband and fellow OEB professor Andrew Berry, and even a brief bit about how the similar spellings of “organismic” and “orgasmic” warrant a good enough reason to consider changing her department’s name.
The Harvard Crimson [THC]: How did you begin your path in the field organismic and evolutionary biology?
Naomi E. Pierce [NEP]: I was a History Arts and Literature major at Yale but I had an interest in the sciences, and I though I might be pre-med, even though I didn’t really know what that meant. I also had a terrible fear of insects. So I decided to take an entomology course in order to get over my fear of insects. This ended very badly the first time I tried it...Back then they did vivisections where you would dissect a live cockroach and look at its beating heart and things like that. They had these great big cockroaches [Madagascar Hissing Cockroach] that they dissect for this because they’re hardy and they’re large. So they asked me to come and pick this cockroach up and take it back to my bench and pin it back and dissect it. And I hung back, and I hung back, and I hung back...I really don’t think the Teaching Fellow realized I was taking this course to get over my fear of insects. Finally, everyone had sat down with their cockroach and had started to work and I was still standing by the pit of cockroaches. And the Teaching Fellow, who at this point was just annoyed with me, said, “Go on! Go on! Just pick it up!” So I reached down and grabbed for it but it had these sharp little spurs on the sides of its legs, which felt like they were cutting me when I picked it up. And it was just too much. So I dropped it and at that moment I burst into tears in front of the whole class in a very dramatic way because they were all staring at me and the Teaching Fellow was yelling at me at this point. And that was it. For a while it didn’t look like I was going to be a biologist. But the next year, I felt so bad about the way that entomology had ended that I decided [in my senior year] I would try again. And I absolutely loved it. I found that not only was I not afraid of insects, but once I got over my fear of picking them up, I was so fascinated by them that...that was it. I just couldn’t study anything else. And I’ve never looked back.
THC: What has been your favorite trip taken for research?
NEP: I think my favorite recent field trip has been to Africa—to Kenya, where we’ve been working on ant plants on the savannahs of East Africa. These are plants that make...little swollen thorns that act as houses for ants. The African plains are covered with these ant plants. It is a kind of Acacia drepanolobium. So as far as the eye can see, you see these beautiful Acacia drepanolobium with the swollen thorns in them and the swollen thorns are full of ants. It’s the most fascinating habitat because browsing between these ant plants are giraffes, rhinoceroses, and elephants [and] whizzing atop the trees are butterflies whose caterpillars interact with these ants. It’s a very interactive and rich habitat; totally fascinating.
THC: You’ve done extensive research on ants; what would you say was the most fascinating results of this research?
NEP: The most interesting result we’ve had recently involved looking at the gut microbiome of ants. [In the lab] we had done an evolutionary history of ants; sort of like a family tree. We used the ants’ DNA to reconstruct the relationships of different species of ants [and then] took the DNA and screened it for bacteria. That enabled us to look at bacteria that resided in the guts of the ants...When we did this we found that most of the ants that had bacteria in their guts were also herbivores. This was a striking pattern—that there was a correlation between having bacteria onboard and also being herbivorous.
THC: Why is evolutionary biology a field that everyone should consider studying?
NEP: One of my favorite quotes is from [Theodosius] Dobzhansky: “Nothing in biology makes sense unless in the light of evolution.” And I think this is very true. We’re animals ourselves; how can you not be interested in other organisms? And if you’re interested in other organisms then automatically there is that quest for discovery. Every organism has a history and learning about that history and learning about the context of that animal is really what Dobzhansky is saying here.
THC: Your husband, Andrew Berry also works in OEB. Who do you think is a stronger force in the field?
NEP: There’s no question that Andrew Berry has much more of a presence on campus than I do. I would defer to him any day when it comes to making a point, delivering a lecture, and in fact he has a mind like a vise. So whenever I can’t remember something, I usually call him up and ask him. Nine times out of ten, he knows what I’m trying to remember....We do very different kinds of research. His interest is more in population genetics and now more macroevolution, or large scale aspects of evolution...He’s very broad in his interests; I’m quite focused on insects and the relationship between insects and plants. He’s more of a big picture person, and I’m more of a experimentalist.
THC: So is the work you do in research better than his?
NEP: Oh sure (Laughs). He’ll forgive me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lachlan Forrow, the director of ethics and palliative care programs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, posed a philosophical question to his audience on prescribing medication to end life: “Who has the right to tell anybody how to die?”
At Thursday afternoon’s public forum at the Harvard Medical School, this question was more than abstract. A panel composed of two medical and two legal experts explained the issues surrounding Question 2 on this November’s general election ballot for Massachusetts, known as the “Death With Dignity” Initiative.
If passed, the initiative would make Massachusetts the third state, after Oregon and Washington, to grant doctors the legal right to prescribe barbiturates to end the life of a terminally-ill patient, a process often referred to as physician-assisted suicide. At the patient’s oral and written request, and with the agreement of at least two physicians, the patient will be given either a pill or a liquid syrup to ingest, putting them to sleep in minutes and granting an almost certain death in the next half hour.
All four panelists at the forum supported the initiative, a leaning mirrored in the composition of the audience, which included both medical students and local community members. A hand vote taken at the beginning of the event revealed that fewer than 10 of the more than 100 people gathered expressed their intention to vote against the measure.
The practice, according to Forrow, is a phenomenon that already happens to some extent in the medical field. Forrow, who has served as the chair of the Massachusetts Expert Panel on End of Life Care, said he believed that the “only thing this law will change is making it not illegal.”
Still, the panelists emphasized that the instances of patients actually taking prescribed medication to end life have been relatively rare.
In an introduction before the panel, event moderators Robert D. Truog and Christine Mitchell, who both teach medical ethics at the Medical School, presented the results of a study on the prevalence of physician-assisted suicide in Oregon since its legalization. Though nearly 200 of every 1,000 adults who died had considered the option, only 20 made formal requests, two received the prescriptions, and one actually took the medicine.
Panelists at the forum said the greatest advantage of the initiative would be the choices offered to terminally ill patients.
Panelist Marcia Angell, a lecturer at the Medical School who was one of the original petitioners for the Death With Dignity Act, added that it gives people the ability to control their environment in their last moments.
“One of the greatest attractions is they can die at home around their loved ones,” she said.
Audience member Gary S. Gray—who works at Harvard Catalyst, a group that seeks to bring cross-disciplinary health care solutions to the public—said that the event, though thought provoking, had not changed his vote on the issue.
“I came undecided,” he said. “I’m still in the middle.”

Sooni Taraporevala ’79 bought her first camera with money she borrowed from her roommate. Decades later, she has returned to Harvard for the opening of her photography exhibition.
Taraporevala spoke on a panel Thursday with Professors Homi K. Bhabha and Sugata Bose to discuss her exhibit, “Parsis, The Zoroastrians of India,” on display at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts until Dec. 20. The collection of photos provides a window into the Parsi community, a religious and ethnic minority in India.
Before the panel discussion began, Taraporevala gave audience members insight into select photographs that she displayed in a slide show: her grandfather leaning in close to the shopkeeper because he was hard of hearing, her young cousin during the ritual seclusion that marked his preparation for priesthood, and her grandmother laughing. She was “probably saying ‘why are you taking my photo again?’” Taraporevala quipped.
“I just started photographing my family,” Taraporevala said of her career’s beginnings. “I wanted to document the older generation before they passed away.”
The Bombay native eventually spent 35 years on a project that began with intensely personal photographs. The collection also includes portraits of prominent Parsis, such as television stars, the former attorney general of India, a nuclear scientist, and Queen singer Freddie Mercury. Taraporevala said that she only included those photographs to make her project more comprehensive.
“I would rather photograph ordinary people,” she stated.
In her discussion with Bhabha and Bose, Taraporevala mused on her creative process and the meaning behind her images.
“As a photographer, you take a photograph and hope that someone interprets it in a certain way...I rely on other people to provide the subtext,” she said.
Bose and Bhabha, a Bombay Parsi himself, offered cultural and historical insight into the unique Parsi community. Bhaba noted that Parsis “don’t have great, stylistic markers” of their community, so a heavy importance is placed on the domestic and quotidian life—a theme that Taraporevala captures in her photographs of Parsis at home and in town.
The juxtaposition of Taraporevala’s earlier photographs with her later images allows viewers to trace the visible transition from more traditional Indian styles to contemporary life with its increasing Western influences.
Audience member Natanya E. Kashan said she found Taraporevala’s work inspiring. She was interested by the photographs of “a culture that is not well-known,” and could appreciate their aesthetics as a young photographer herself.
“Her images are really beautiful,” she said.

Amidst mounting anticipation surrounding the presidential election, Nina Perales, an advocate for Mexican-American rights, told audience members Thursday that minority voting rights are still not universally respected.
“[There is] a real fear about Latino growth and Latino voting,” Perales, who is vice president for litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said at a talk at Harvard Law School. She added that this fear has manifested itself in voter identification laws and Congressional districting plans that infringe on Latino choice.
Launching into a discussion on gerrymandering, Perales presented the audience with a map of Texas’s Congressional District 26. For the most part, Congressional District 26 is a square, but it has a skinny appendage on its southern side.
“That’s what we call the lightning bolt,” Perales said.
The lightning bolt portion of Congressional District 26 is predominantly Latino, she said. In order to dilute the Latino vote, Perales said, politicians have added this lightning bolt to a district full of “Anglo” voters.
Texas’ 23rd Congressional District, Perales said, is another example of how politicians can draw Congressional districts to lessen the impact of minority voters.
“They made [District 23] a Latino-majority district where Latino choice would not win,” she said. “They made sure Latinos were low-turnout, low-efficacy voters.”
In addition to districting schemes, Perales has found herself battling the various voter identification requirements that some states have enacted in recent years.
“People are convinced that there are all sorts of non-citizens voting, which isn’t true,” Perales said.
According to Perales, the effect of photo identification requirements is not to prevent voter fraud, but rather to keep Latino citizens, particularly young Latino citizens, from the polls. Perales discussed two young Latino women who interned at her office.
“They don’t have driver’s licenses because they come from low-income families,” she said. “Their insurance premiums would double.”
A common theme in Perales’s presentation was that the Republicans and Democrats were both at fault for the marginalization of Latino voters.
“They slice and dice minority districts in whatever way is best for them,” Perales said.
“I think the most important thing that she talked about is the idea of Latino choice and majority choice,” said Noah B. Kaplan, a student at Harvard Law School who attended the event. “It’s not about electing people of a particular party or a particular color but about giving voters the opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice.”
For Jessica K. Gorman, a Law School student from New Zealand, Perales’ lecture was an introduction to gerrymandering and the marginalization of minorities.
“At home, there’s never been talk that the boundary drawing has been done to include or exclude certain populations,” said Gorman.
However, for Kaplan, a Houston native, the lecture touched on issues which she said were all too familiar.
“I think she’s doing some really great work, because given the opportunity, the political system there will disenfranchise Latino voters, African-American voters, and pretty much whoever else they can,” he said.

The College has overhauled the system used by faculty members to report their students’ midterm progress grades.
A new online portal was launched earlier this month to allow professors to submit progress reports for struggling students to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ registrar’s office at any point during the term. Registrar Michael P. Burke said the progress reports, which include space for faculty members to write a message and choose from a list of options to indicate why the student is falling behind in a course, are directly viewable by the student’s resident dean.
“The purpose of this and the real benefit is more timely notification for resident deans to work with students who may have some concerns,” Burke said.
The new tool has been long in the making. When former FAS registrar Barry S. Kane left Harvard in 2010, he said that his biggest regret of his seven-year tenure was not digitalizing the midterm grade submission system.
Previously, under the old paper-based system, faculty members were required to submit progress grades for all students on their rosters to the registrar’s office by a single deadline midway through the semester. The unsatisfactory progress grades would then be scanned and sent to resident deans.
Faculty and administrators say that on the whole, the new tool is a marked improvement.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology lecturer Andrew Berry said that in the past, he has communicated directly with resident deans because he thought the old paper system was too slow to get help on time for struggling students in his courses.
Now, he said, he is pleased with the “massively streamlined” process.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky said that under the old system, his grade reports would often be due before his students had even turned in their first essays, making it impossible for him to evaluate which students were falling behind. While he would often informally contact his students’ resident deans throughout past semesters, he said he appreciates the “centralized reminder” of the new tool.
“It taps us on the shoulder and makes sure that we’re doing it,” Levitsky said. “It doesn’t guarantee, but it’s sort of one additional check to make sure that we’re looking out early enough for students who are slipping through the cracks.”
Adams Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell praised the new tool’s efficiency, but added that she hopes to see the system further streamlined.
“From the point of view of the resident dean, I think we would love to figure out a way to go even a step further and to connect the faculty even more directly with the student,” Howell said.
Undergraduate Council President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 agreed. He said he would like students, in addition to resident deans, to be able to view the online progress reports to encourage conversations between struggling students and the faculty members who can help them.
Burke said that another ongoing digitalization project—a portal that would allow students to access their unofficial transcripts online—is still underway. He said he hopes to implement the new records, which would include full course titles rather than the abbreviated listings currently viewable online, by the end of this academic year.
“It’s definitely still a priority of the registrar’s office, and we’re working with every relevant team to get that done,” Burke said.

Sexologist Jill McDevitt held a light blue bottle in her hands, twirling it between her fingers for her audience to see. The over 200 students who had gathered for her workshop on “The Female Orgasm and All Things Penis” started laughing. On the bottle’s label were the words: “Female Arousal Cream.”
“This cream will give you a pleasurable sensation,” McDevitt said, removing the bottle’s cap with a yank. “Who wants to go to the bathroom, try it out, and tell us how it feels?”
One by one, more than 10 students at the workshop during Harvard’s second annual Sex Week—the best-attended event of the week so far—stood and approached McDevitt to get some of the mint flavored cream. Cleopatra’s Secret Sex Creme also comes in strawberry and cherry vanilla, McDevitt said.
The audience watched these students exit and enter the room, gauging their facial expressions.
“There’s a lot of things going on down there,” Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 said as she returned to her seat.
The event, the eighth held during Sex Week, was a combination of two workshops, one focused on the female orgasm and the other on the penis, which McDevitt said she had “thrown together just for Harvard.” In addition to reminding the audience of what they had learned in high school sex education, she also spoke about the challenges of achieving orgasm, saying that 75 percent of women have faked experiencing the sensation at least once in their lives.
“Some go into sex on a mission to orgasm, others just swim past a water jet and accidentally experience it,” she said. She later shared that her personal record was 67 orgasms in one hour.
According to McDevitt, there are three main reasons that “reaching the big O” is so difficult: “misinformation about genitals, misinformation about orgasms themselves, and the general dislike people have for their genitals.”
“Genitals are not dirty,” McDevitt said. “They are beautiful not only to our appearance, but also to our experience of sex and sexuality.”
Students also played “pin the clit on the vulva,” learned more about anatomy with models of a penis and vulva, and anonymously wrote down their insecurities concerning sex and genitalia for McDevitt to read out loud.
Some students stepped outside their comfort zones and spoke about experiencing their first orgasm. One student said that he first experienced an orgasm when he was 11 years old.
“I was rubbing myself and thinking of Pokemon,” he said.
Students said that they appreciated the comfortable and safe environment that McDevitt established at the event.
“Some sex talks are really serious, but this was an informative, relaxing environment,” Anahvia Mewborn ’16 said. “It was comforting to hear that everyone has insecurities too.”
Arthur D. Kaynor ’12, who co-directed Peer Contraceptive Counselors last year, said he came back to attend this workshop, which he knew was going to be Sex Week’s most popular event. He showed his support by wearing the classic, pink vulva costume.
“I wore it a lot last year too,” he said. “I asked to wear it because it’s pretty and sparkly.”

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie became the latest out-of-state politician to lend a hand in the hard-fought Massachusetts U.S. Senate race on Wednesday, when he endorsed U.S. Senator Scott Brown at a rally in Watertown.
Speaking through a megaphone held by Brown, the firebrand New Jersey Republican called Brown an independent, open-minded leader who would not “posture and pose” along party lines like those who have forced Washington into gridlock.
“If you all like what’s going on in Washington, D.C. right now, if you like the divisiveness, if you like the fact that most of those folks down there don’t know how to work across the aisle, don’t know how to solve real problems...then you’ve got the perfect choice on the ballot for that candidate. You should vote for Professor Warren,” Christie said, referring to Brown’s Democratic opponent, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.
“She won’t even look across the aisle, let alone reach across the aisle,” Christie added a few moments later. “And yet, you’ve got a Senator here who has served this state extraordinarily well by making sure that he talks to Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everyone.
”Christie, who is thought to be a rising star in the Republican party, linked his own political career to Brown’s, explaining that his own 2010 gubernatorial inauguration coincided with Brown’s special election victory in Massachusetts and ushered in a new style of Republican bi-partisanship.
“We have been connected ever since,” Christie said.
Endorsements like Christie’s are not uncommon for a Senatorial candidate, especially one entrenched in a tight race that is thought to have national importance. The New Jersey Republican is the latest in a growing group of out-of-state politicians who have swooped into the Bay State to bet their chips on either side of the Massachusetts U.S. Senate race in recent weeks.
U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) used his national importance to boost Brown’s candidacy at a rally here on Oct. 20. Leaning on his own political capital and incorporating flares of his characteristic humor, U.S. Senator Al Franken ’73 (D-MN) spent much of last weekend firing up volunteers and voters on the campaign trail with Warren. The Democratic candidate had also previously received support from former U.S. Senator Max Cleland (D-GA).
Massachusetts is one of a handful of swing states that could determine which party has a majority in the Senate starting in January. A WBUR poll released Monday by MassINC Polling group showed Warren up by five points, leading Brown 48 percent to 43 percent. The poll, which surveyed 516 likely voters from Oct. 21 to Oct. 22, had a 4.4 point margin of error, indicating that the race is still close.
The endorsements and campaign trail appearances reflect what robust out-of-state financial donations have long suggested: Republicans and Democrats across the country are willing to go a long way to see their party win this Senate seat.
To what degree out-of-state endorsements will make a difference is unclear. While party leaders are well positioned to excite voter bases, they may not sway independent voters, especially if the endorsements are expected, said Democratic political strategist Dan Payne.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just months after Boston’s Hubway opened its first bike station in Cambridge, Zagster, one of the nation’s oldest bicycle sharing companies, has moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to Kendall Square.
With the new offices less than a mile from the pioneering car sharing company Zipcar, Zagster’s arrival earlier this year has continued to develop Cambridge as a center of sustainable urban living.  Zagster, founded in 2007 as CityRyde, aims to provide bikes through contracting with businesses, hotels, and universities. This model stands in contrast to Hubway’s program, which is a regional network intending to serve the greater Boston community.
Zagster has opened two locations in Cambridge so far, one at University Park at MIT and another at the Hyatt on Memorial Drive.
The company offers use of the bikes at its University Park station for $9 per day, $30 per month, or $50 per year. Contrastingly, Hubway’s options include one-day, three-day, or annual memberships, which include both a flat fee and per-use charge for rides longer than 30 minutes.
Zagster has not yet made contracts with Harvard or MIT, both of which have already sponsored Hubway stations.
Hubway, a city-wide initiative, began operating in Boston in July 2011 and expanded to Cambridge in April 2012.
“I know both MIT and Harvard have been involved since the get-go,” said Adam Serafin, a MIT campus planner. “It’s a great opportunity to provide another means of transportation for students.”
MIT opened two stations, located at Mass. Ave and Amherst Street and in front of the MIT Stata Center on Vassar Street, in August 2012.
Harvard has invested in 12 stations across its Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood campuses.
“It not only connects our campuses, but provides bike sharing to communities and residents throughout the Boston region,” Harvard sustainability spokesperson Colin B. Durrant wrote in an email.
Five of Harvard’s stations currently operating are located near the College campus: Mass. Ave., the Charles Hotel, Brattle Street, the Law School, and DeWolfe Street.
One station is expected to be installed in the Quad, though the location has yet to be finalized.
Durrant said the Quad station may not be installed this fall, but he expected it to be operating by next spring. Another station is expected at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Unlike Harvard, MIT signed on as a Hubway corporate member and offers subsidized annual memberships—$25, rather than the standard $85—as well as discounted hourly rates to MIT employees and students.
According to Serafin, MIT has sold over 500 subsidized passes.
Harvard has not yet subsidized the program.
“We are focusing on expanding access and providing students and others in the community with an integrated bike network throughout our campuses, while also supporting the growth of the regional bike sharing network,” Durrant wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The shrinking source of elements used in fertilizers and the practices of corporate farming pose significant problems for the agriculture sector, Harvard Business School graduate and Grantham Foundation founder Jeremy Grantham said in a panel on agricultural leadership and innovation hosted by the Harvard Alumni for Agriculture.
Grantham, along with three other Harvard affiliates, spoke Thursday to an audience of students and representatives from local food companies about the global implications of sustainable agriculture and the need for leadership in the field.
“You can’t grow forever with finite resources, but everyone thinks you can,” Grantham said. “It’s baked into capitalism, it’s baked into the American corporate way.”
Gary Rodkin, the CEO of ConAgra Foods, spoke directly to students pursuing careers in agribusiness about the importance of spreading business worldwide.
“We follow our customers globally, we supply them globally,” Rodkin said. “You can see McDonalds and KFCs building five restaurants a day in China, and we supply them. Whatever you debate as the merits of french fries, I’ve never met a person in the world who doesn’t like them. So it’s just about availability.”
The panel also discussed the global problem of coordination within food industries. Calestous Juma, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School whose work focuses on technology and sustainable development, drew from his experience working with the Kenyan government.
“Looking at the agricultural system, we realized that very little of what supports agriculture is under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Agriculture,” Juma said. “We started to think about how to coordinate it, and it became evident that no one minister could do it.
”The final panelist, Business School professor Ray A. Goldberg ’48 added to Juma’s commentary on issues in agribusiness. He described his work in the past two decades to bridge gaps between business leaders.
“How do you get people who distrust each other to sit down and realize that they’re working for the same common denominator?” Goldberg said.
Goldberg encouraged the students present, many of whom are studying subjects related to agribusiness at the Kennedy School or the Law School, to approach the sector with a different outlook from that of the previous generation.
“The challenge has never been greater, the opportunity has never been greater,” Goldberg said. “Instead of ‘I win, you lose’ mentality of transactions, you’re going to live in a world that says ‘we both win.’ It’s a win-win situation.”
A reception that featured food and beverages from local startups founded by Harvard alums preceded the panel. Lorin A. Fries, a recent graduate of the Kennedy School and the director of corporate relations for the Harvard Alumni for Agriculture, described the event as an opportunity for the students to interact with panelists who are already experts in the field.
“This is meant to introduce people to each other across the schools, introduce students to panelists, and introduce local businesses,” Fries said. “It’s meant to be representing a number of aspects of the Harvard community who are engaged in food and agriculture and to establish those sorts of connections.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part IV of a four-part series analyzing how successful the 2009-2010 reforms have been in making the Administrative Board’s disciplinary process more educational, transparent, and empowering for accused students. Part I, Part II, and Part III were published Oct. 23-25.
When Natasha faced disciplinary proceedings for a non-academic infraction at Harvard, she was questioned by two faculty members, both at least twice her age.
Natasha said that at her hearing, she was intimidated by what she perceived as aggressive questioning by her two interrogators, both of whom serve on the Administrative Board with other professors and administrators.
For Natasha, the presence of a third judge closer to her own age and status at Harvard would have eased her anxiety.
“Having a student on the subcommittee would have made me feel so much more comfortable, because I think a lot of the weirdness there is the power dynamic,” said Natasha, who requested that her name be changed because she did not want it known that she had been in disciplinary trouble at Harvard.
Harvard’s lack of student representation in its disciplinary body is unusual among Ivy League institutions—of the seven others, six offer at least an option for accused undergraduates to be judged by both faculty and students.
Three years ago, the committee charged with reforming the Ad Board suggested that Harvard should fall in line with its peers. In its 2009 report, the Committee to Review the Administrative Board recommended further discussion about creating a second board made up of both students and officials.
But without any formal discussion, the idea fell by the wayside.
This fall, as a massive cheating scandal revives dormant calls for a Harvard honor code, some say it is high time for the dropped proposal of an alternative board to be reconsidered.
A JURY OF THEIR PEERS
Technically, the College has had a secondary disciplinary board populated by both students and faculty for a quarter of a century. But the Student Faculty Judiciary Board, designed to hear cases not covered by existing faculty legislation, has heard just one case since its 1987 inception.
But the alternative board proposed by the reform committee would have had a much wider jurisdiction, covering non-peer disputes, like cases of plagiarism caught by professors. It would have consisted of three students and four additional voting members.
Accused students would have had the opportunity to go before either the traditional Ad Board or the alternative board to have their cases heard. Under the proposal, peer disputes such as sexual assault cases would continue to be heard by faculty and administrators only.
In 2009 and 2010, Harvard adopted parts one and two of the reform committee’s three-part proposal, including changes to the size of the hearings and the penalties doled out to cheaters. Part three, which called for discussion of a board including students, was never addressed.
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement that the
College chose to focus on implementing other recommendations first.
And Danny P. Bicknell ’13, the current Undergraduate Council president, said that conversations are currently lodged at a much more modest point.
In talks with Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison, he has discussed creating a watered-down alternative to the reform committee’s proposal: a student advisory committee that could recommend decisions but not vote on cases.
Bicknell said he does not foresee his proposal being implemented quickly but believes it could find support among administrators.
But Neal suggested that student representation in disciplinary proceedings was unwanted.
“In truth, we have heard from many students that they would not be anxious for other students to have detailed information about themselves or their actions as part of a disciplinary procedure,” wrote Neal, who declined to speak in person or by phone about the Ad Board.
All 30 current members of the Ad Board declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment for this series.
Certainly, not all undergraduates want to be judged by their peers; several students interviewed for this article who have faced or are facing Ad Board proceedings said they would be opposed to the idea.
But supporters of student representation stressed that the process proposed by the reform committee would be optional.
The reform committee’s report read, “Although not universally held, even among students, there is a view on campus that students should be involved in deciding disciplinary cases, as they have a direct understanding of the stresses and demands on their peers.”
Bicknell, who made the issue a plank in his presidential campaign platform last November, said that none of the students he, his running mate, or his campaign staff interviewed expressed opposition to the idea of increased student involvement in the disciplinary process.
JUDGING THE JUDGES
Some experts say they are wary of student representation on disciplinary boards because of the difficulty of properly training undergraduate judges.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a Stetson University professor who specializes in higher education law, said colleges must devote extensive resources to choosing and educating student representatives.
He added that Harvard in particular, which currently follows a “patrician” model in which experienced academics rigorously weigh evidence before coming to a decision, may worry that student representation could dilute the thoroughness of the process.
But Lake said that when schools are successful in training their student judges, the disciplinary process often becomes more credible.
Michael R. Schneider, a Boston lawyer who has consulted with students facing the Ad Board, agreed. “It adds a more democratic component to the process, being judged by a jury of your peers who are a little less removed,” he said.
Matthew L. Sundquist ’09, a former UC president who was the only student on the reform committee, acknowledged the challenges inherent in adding student judges but stood by the proposal. “I think it’s tricky, complicated, and I think it would be would hard, but I think it would be extraordinarily valuable,” he said.
Stephen Bryan, an associate dean who runs the Student Conduct Office at Duke University, said that students chosen to serve on Duke’s undergraduate disciplinary board are vetted to check that they are mature enough to deliberate on serious cases.
At Duke, a student must be a junior or senior to sit on the board. And the rigorous application process is competitive each year—typically, about 150 students complete multiple essays, interviews, and oral exercises in the hope of claiming one of the 12 to 14 student positions on the board.
Bryan said the system has been successful. In his 13 years at Duke, he said, just one student has been asked to resign from the Board for leaking confidential information.
PULLING BACK THE CURTAIN
Even after codifying a standard of evidence as part of the reforms, the Ad Board continues to face criticism that it lacks transparency about its proceedings and outcomes.
Critics point to the long-delayed database of Ad Board case summaries, which College administrators initially said they planned to release by the end of 2010. In February 2011, the management fellow in charge of compiling the database predicted that it would be released by the end of that academic year, and in April 2012, Ellison said he expected the first part of the database in a month. But that database has yet to be seen, and there is no new timeframe for its release.
Some say that by finding a place for students in its process, the Ad Board could help reverse its reputation for opacity.
“It would be a tremendous thing,” said attorney Harvey A. Silverglate, a Harvard Law School alumnus who has repeatedly published writings criticizing the Ad Board. “It would go a long way toward straightening out the system and making it more transparent.”
Bryan said that at Duke, student representation has been essential in increasing the clarity of the process for fellow students.
“It certainly demystifies the process by having students on the panel who can talk informally with their peers,” Bryan said. “I have this sense that at Harvard there’s this aura about the Admin Board—no one really knows about it.”
HONORABLE INTENTIONS
Experts say that student representation in Harvard’s disciplinary process would not only increase the Board’s transparency but would also help foster integrity at Harvard.
“When students hear information about academic dishonesty from their fellow students, it has greater impact than when it comes from administrators,” said Gary M. Pavela, a former director of academic integrity at Syracuse University who has also consulted with other institutions about their disciplinary processes. “If you have a student talking to other students about academic integrity, that’s when you begin to change your culture.”
But Lake said that student representation in the disciplinary process often only works if a campus culture centered on integrity already exists.
For some, an honor code—a policy formally trusting students to uphold ethical standards without policing—would set the stage for even greater trust of students, as judges in the disciplinary process.
Stanford University has long had an honor code, and in 1997, it replaced its disciplinary board with one that included students. The justification: all members of the university community governed by the honor code should have a role in enforcing that policy.
Biology professor Richard M. Losick said that he thinks that Harvard would benefit from both an honor code and student representation.
“It would put the responsibility on students for their own behavior,” he said, adding that as a student at Princeton, he felt the honor code inspired honesty.
At Harvard, the Committee on Academic Integrity, first convened in fall 2010, is currently debating instituting an honor code.
Last week, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who chairs the committee, wrote in an emailed statement that the committee is not yet ready to release any information about its discussions. But in the wake of the Government 1310 scandal, some have called for Harvard to turn these talks into policy.
And as the honor code talks continue and the student government lobbies for a student role with the Ad Board, one long-time observer of Harvard’s disciplinary process still sounds a harsh note of pessimism.
“Right now, the administration has total control of the Ad Board. As soon as you put students on, you don’t have total control,” Silverglate said. “Until there’s a major shift in Harvard’s culture towards openness, I don’t think there’s going to be a student on the Ad Board.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A negative return on an investment is likely to cause anxiety for investors concerned about the long-term viability of their assets. For this reason, Harvard’s announcement of a negative 0.05 return on its investments attracted media attention across the globe.
But experts on higher education finance downplayed Harvard’s negative returns and the about 4.1 percent decline in its endowment, contextualizing the performance as part of a broader trend in university endowments.
Returns on university endowments were comparatively low for fiscal year 2012 across the board. Yale University this year earned a 4.7 percent return on its investments and Princeton, 3.1 percent. Both universities, which are among the schools with the top five largest endowments, earned a 21.9 percent returns for fiscal year 2011.
Preliminary data indicates that 200 of the largest educational institutions reported an average negative 0.03 return this past year, according to John S. Griswold, executive director of Commonfund Institute.
“It indicates that there’s going to be a lot of disappointment. But, this is a challenging time for all investors,” he said. “We try to be crystal-ball gazers, but clearly it’s going to be a while before the markets settle down.”
This year Harvard’s endowment dipped for the first time since fiscal year 2009, falling about 4.1 percent to $30.7 billion. In the previous fiscal year Harvard’s endowment grew by 21.4 percent to $32 billion, and over the past 20 years Harvard’s annual endowment return has averaged 12.3 percent.
Experts said that the 2012 fiscal year’s lower returns are a consequence of a broader trend in investments.
“It’s the market. The economy has been uncertain and it’s just reflecting market returns,” said Lucie Lapovsky, who consults on higher education finances. “In any one year the return can be significantly negative and significantly positive. You have to be able to live with the ups and downs.”
While Harvard’s endowment yielded flat returns, experts said the success of Harvard Management Corporation’s investment strategy should be evaluated by assessing the endowment’s performance as compared to HMC’s predetermined benchmarks.
Overall, Harvard’s endowment beat HMC’s benchmark Policy Portfolio, a set of assets determined by the HMC board to best serve Harvard’s long-run financial needs, by about a percentage point.
Harvard’s endowment is broken into five asset classes: public equities, private equity, fixed income, absolute return, and real assets. Within those asset classes, the endowment outperformed the benchmark in all areas except private equity, where it fell 2.05 percent short.
Lawrence E. Golub ’80, who runs Golub Capital, a private equity and venture capital firm, described private equity as an asset class that is “hard to estimate.”
According to Golub, private equity underperformed the stock market and the bond market in fiscal year 2012.
Harvard’s endowment also has an unusually large stake in foreign equities, which fared far worse than many other asset classes this fiscal year. Of the broad asset classes, only public equities, which include foreign equities, posted negative returns for the 2012 fiscal year.
Returns from Harvard’s endowment—the largest of any educational institution around the world—funds 35 percent of the University’s operating budget. The payout structure of the endowment allows the University to continue to fund its operation in years with low returns.
Griswold noted that donors set many restrictions on the use of revenue from money they donate. While the University is likely to raise billions in its upcoming capital campaign, HMC’s leadership will not have free reign with those donations.
Despite the dip in the endowment and investment returns, confidence in HMC, headed up by President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo, remained high both inside or outside the University.
“In such volatile economic times, it’s important to note that results in any 12 month period can vary dramatically,” University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 said in the press release. “Jane and her team have done an excellent job strengthening Harvard’s portfolio and I’m confident the endowment is well positioned for the long-term.”
Griswold, who leads the NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments, also praised Mendillo’s stewardship.
“Harvard’s managers are amongst the most capable of managers in this business and I think they’ll continue to [be] that,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brian J. Mendel ’15 knocked on the front door, and, after waiting a few moments, jammed a Vote Obama flyer into the door’s handle, other pamphlets already crammed there.
“Welcome to the life of a New Hampshire voter,” he said.
Last weekend, about 35 Harvard students drove an hour and a half to Rochester, New Hampshire, hoping to secure votes for President Barack Obama in the crucial swing state as election day draws near.
Donning Obama campaign pins, Mendel and Peter E. Menz ’15, a Crimson arts editor, roamed the sleepy streets of Rochester, periodically referring to their list of about 30 assigned voters, autumn leaves crunching beneath their shoes as they walked from to door to door.
The presidential election is fewer than three weeks away, and polls suggest that New Hampshire voters are torn between the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates—a fact that worries Democrats since Obama easily won the state in 2008.
With Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney neck-and-neck in New Hampshire and nationally, front stoop conversations such as these could be the difference between Obama’s success or failure.
“[It’s] kind of a nerve-wracking experience because they have the election in their hands,” Harvard Democrats Campaign Director Simon M. Thompson ’14 said of New Hampshire voters. “You have to let people know that this is urgent.”
A CALL TO ARMS
As the yellow school bus carrying Harvard students rolled into Rochester, Daniel R. Ki ’15, head coordinator of Harvard for Obama, stood up to address his fellow students, many of whom were still groggy from Friday night escapades.
“A typical response is no response at all,” Ki warned the volunteers, drawn from the Harvard for Obama team, the Harvard College Democrats, as well as the Kennedy School and Law School.
“Every door that you knock on does make a difference,” he said, while telling canvassers that typically only about 5 percent of residents will even answer their doors.
The bus came to its destination as Ki made his last points. It was a little after 2 p.m. Canvassers filed into Rochester’s Democratic campaign headquarters, a cozy office with blue walls plastered with posters and charts. A countdown reminded volunteers how few days remained in the race: 17.
Carol Shea-Porter, an N. H. Democrat running for the House seat that she lost two years ago, was the first to address the Harvard volunteer crew.
“You’re the reason that we’re going to win,” she said, noting the significance of volunteers in her 2006 and 2008 campaigns for Congress.
“Who wants to go forward?” she said. She was greeted by cheers and applause.
Mike, a campaign coordinator based in New Hampshire’s Democratic headquarters, recalled how 7,211 votes separated Bush from Gore in 2000. Obama’s win or loss in New Hampshire could decide the election, he said.
New Hampshire is “carrying the United States forward,” he added. “This is the most important thing you can do.”
HITTING THE STREETS
Riled up after the pep talks, Harvard students set forth on the small, mostly empty streets of Rochester, a town of 30,000 nestled on the Maine border.
Volunteers carried a roster of voters, a map of Rochester neighborhoods, and a stack of promotional pamphlets and flyers.
This canvassing effort, Harvard for Obama’s third trip this fall, was markedly different from earlier attempts to win New Hampshire votes. Swaying undecided votes was only a secondary focus this time. Instead, organizers told volunteers to shore up already-won votes by urging registered Democrats to turn out at the polls on Nov. 6.
This was, in part, due to lackluster enthusiasm for Obama as compared to 2008, canvassers said.
“It was kind of a different race,” Stephanie A. O’Connell ’13, a Harvard for Obama coordinator who volunteered in New Hampshire in 2008. Four years ago, Obama was “a new figure, not wrapped in politics. Now, a lot of it is about the issues,” she said.
Mendel and Menz, both veteran canvassers, walked out of campaign headquarters, stopping in the parking lot to chart their route.
The duo encountered a variety of reactions to their attempts to win blue votes.
At the first house that they visited, a disheveled middle-aged man in a red bathrobe emerged, holding back a few barking dogs.
“I don’t vote,” he said promptly, shutting the door behind him.
Drawing from a script provided by campaign headquarters, Mendel and Menz soon settled into a routine, taking turns to speak to voters.
“Can President Obama count on your vote on election day?” they asked again and again.
Often, no one would be home, and after a few minutes of tapping door knockers, they would leave promotional flyers under doormats and in door handles.
Menz and Mendel soon found themselves at a multi-family home. The pair, unable to find the specific front door they were looking for, tried the garage door.
Moments later, the door rose, stiff wheels creaking as it came up. A woman emerged and responded enthusiastically to the questions.
“Oh, I like him. I’m going to vote for him,” the woman said.
Another man, his baby in one arm and his young son by his knees, told Mendel and Menz that he planned to bring his older child to the voting booth along with him.
Mendel had found during past experiences that “most people just really don’t want to talk to you.” This effort, however, was much more successful: “The people that we did talk to didn’t tell us to go away,” he said.
“It was a pretty friendly neighborhood,” Menz added.
A VOICE ON THE GROUND
At 4:30 p.m., students began to gather in the garage of the campaign headquarters, grabbing snacks and swapping stories.
“I had a great experience,” said Micaela Pacheco Ceballos ’15, a campus coordinator for the Harvard for Obama team. “Out of the 40 houses that we visited, we talked to 10 people.”
Pacheco Ceballos said that the “stark differences” between the candidates and a sense of “civic duty” had motivated her to get involved in the campaign, mentioning that she had successfully reached out to a young, first-time voter.
“Even if it’s just one guy that asked to register to vote, we made a difference,” said Rebecca V. Park ’16, who campaigned in 2008 with her parents.
Harvard for Obama Campus Coordinator Sylvia A. Percovich ’15 canvassed although she cannot vote as she does not have U.S. citizenship.
“I could participate and give back to what I consider my country,” said Percovich. “If I didn’t have a voice in the ballot, I can have one on the ground,”
Percovich said she was pleasantly surprised by some residents’ willingness to talk with a stranger about a matter that, for some, can be very personal.
“People are really excited about the election, so they’re willing to engage you,” she said, alluding to one of her conversations with an undecided voter.
Thompson, the campaign director for the Harvard Dems, also emphasized that canvassing allows students to connect with voters who have much more life experience. Thompson mentioned an elderly couple who both expressed disappointment with the negativity of politics and, therefore, had yet to decide on their votes.
“It’s always a really nice experience. It’s nice to get that real world aspect,” Thompson said.
LOOKING FORWARD
As the school bus rolled out of placid Rochester, students chatted about the day’s highlights, sharing tales of feisty dogs and frustrating conversations and parsing out the differences between New Hampshire and Cambridge.
Two hours later, the evergreens and suburban streets of Rochester far behind them, the campaigners—many still wearing stickers and pins promoting the Democratic party—arrived in Cambridge.
Before the crew disembarked and returned to academics and dorm life, Ki stood up and announced the results of the day’s work: they had knocked on 700 doors and spoken to over 100 New Hampshire residents.
Already looking to the next step, Ki told the canvassers about future trips in early November.
He asked students to participate in at least one more effort. And if they participated in all three?
“I would die of joy,” he said.

A razor thin lead for President Barack Obama in New Hampshire and a Massachusetts Senate race that is too close to call have Harvard College politicos racing to Nov. 6, forced to decide where to invest their diminishing time and resources.
Because Massachusetts almost always votes Democrat in presidential elections, Harvard College Democrats and Republicans typically spend the final weeks before election day knocking on doors and handing out flyers across the border in New Hampshire, a perennial swing state.
But this time around, the groups have been pullled back into Massachusetts, where a tight Senate race between U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren has attracted national attention and a glut of local resources.
“Obviously Massachusetts hadn’t elected a Republican senator for a few there’s a lot of enthusiasm on campus about how unusual a circumstance it is that Massachusetts can help keep the Senate blue,” said Simon M. Thompson ’14, the campaign coordinator for the Democrats. “Especially since the Brown election was held while students were off-campus, this time around we have a really incredible opportunity.”
Campus interns for both presidential and senatorial campaigns have taken the lead organizing phone banks, canvassing trips, and other “get out the vote” efforts in both states, leaving political club leaders and their members with the decision about where to devote their efforts.
“Every campaign wants your resources,” said Derek J. Bekebrede ’13, the president of the College Republicans, during a canvassing trip earlier this month. “It’s definitely a decision, but for us it was how do we make most efficient use of our resources.”
Democratic and Republican leaders said that the two groups have tried to divide their time fairly between races, alternating weekend canvassing trips to New Hampshire and Eastern Massachusetts. Bekebrede said the Republicans decide on a “case by case” basis. Last weekend, they attended a rally on the North Shore while this weekend they will bus to New Hampshire with the Democrats.
Thompson said the Dems did not face a major dilemma between campaigns until last weekend, when 35 members went to New Hampshire and 20 to 25 elected to join the College Democrats of Massachusetts in Plymouth to canvass for Warren. Prior to that weekend, Warren’s campaign had been focused on registering voters, an initiative that required fewer volunteers. Warren’s campaign registered 154 Harvard students, Thompson said.
“Until election day it is going to be be an all out effort,” Thompson said. The Democrats have buses scheduled to go to New Hampshire this weekend and on election day, but he said that he also imagines there will be plenty of Democrats who stay in-state, helping the Warren campaign. It will be up to individual students to decide between the two, Thompson said, though he imagines more students will be drawn northward.
“Probably what it just comes down to right now is the polls. Warren is up and there’s a lot of fluctuation nationally,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A. Clayton Spencer, a former Harvard vice president for policy, was inaugurated as the eighth President of Bates College Friday afternoon. The inauguration occurred just a day after the Bates Chapel was named in honor of the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, Harvard's long-time Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals.
In her address, Spencer discussed what she saw as the challenges facing higher education and liberal arts colleges like Bates.
“In certain respects, we lag [behind] our peers in wealth and fame and market position,” Spencer said, according to prepared remarks. “But we are not in danger of living someone else’s life. We know who we are and what we stand for, and we stand ready–together–to challenge ourselves and to engage the world.”
President Drew G. Faust, who presented Spencer to an audience of 2,500 people, praised her during the ceremony.
“Clayton Spencer is the embodiment of this institution’s long held dedication to the liberating power of education,” Faust said, according to prepared remarks. “She never lets those around her forget the fundamental purposes of what we do, the human meaning of learning and scholarship, the extraordinary power of schools and colleges to transform lives and transform the world.”
Spencer left Harvard this past June and assumed the Bates presidency in July. Friday’s inauguration made her appointment official.
Spencer served under four University presidents during her time at Harvard and gained a reputation as an effective force for instituting University policy. 
In interviews this spring, University administrators repeatedly praised Spencer for her efforts to expand access to Harvard through efforts like the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. When President Lawrence H. Summers proposed a massive overhaul to Harvard’s financial aid policy in 2004, Spencer was left with the challenge of making the proposal work from a policy perspective.
“I think I can say clearly that I don’t think that our financial aid initiatives would have occurred in anywhere near the shape or form that they have without her and she was in on the ground floor from the very beginning,” Director of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson earlier this year.
Spencer has said that she plans to continue her efforts to expand access to higher education during her tenure at Bates, but that the college’s small size creates a different set of challenges. Bates enrolls 1,800 students and has a $231 million endowment.
“There’s a very strong progressive tradition at Bates that is kind of a model of inclusivity and the notion that everybody deserves an education,” she told The Crimson in April. “It completely resonates with my basic values about access and affordability.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the hoards of Head of the Charles fans still trickling out of Cambridge lugging suitcases full of vendor freebies, it’s not a stretch to say that crew is on the mind. For Kelly Bauer, it might be safe to say crew is always on the mind.
Not only is the junior resident of Leverett House a member of the Radcliffe heavyweight squad, but her boyfriend, Nick Jaroszewicz, rows for the men’s heavyweights and her close friend, Greer Rosenbaum, is a coxswain for the Radcliffe heavyweights as well.
As a part of our For Love or the Game series, we asked Kelly a handful of questions and then posed the same ones to Nick and Greer to see who knew her better. The results were worthy of a photo-finish.
 
Kelly Bauer, junior rower for women’s heavyweight crew
 
Favorite athlete: Probably Esther Lofgren, a Radcliffe crew alum who's raced in the Olympic eight for gold both in Beijing and in London
Pre-race jam: Usually just a playlist of random hip-hop and some Top 40 to be honest haha
Secret talent: Singing, I was in two choirs in high school
TV show: Modern Family, I have all four seasons on my computer...in a close second comes Grey's Anatomy though, I'm basically obsessed with both
Favorite late-night food: …I would say buffalo chicken wings...
Superpower of choice: I guess it would be super strength because then I could row the boat faster!
Sport you’d play other than your own: I would play water polo because I played that before I started rowing and loved it
 
 
Nick Jaroszewicz, junior rower for men’s heavyweight crew and Kelly’s boyfriend
 
Favorite athlete: Esther Lofgren (10)
Pre-race jam: Generic Boathouse Music, probably by White Panda (We think this might mean Top 40? Not sure though, so 7.5)
Secret talent: She's also a great singer! (10)
TV show: Modern Family, with Grey's Anatomy close behind (Spot on! 10)
Favorite late-night food: At Harvard? Berryline—Nutella Flavor (0)
Superpower of choice: Flight (0)
Sport you'd play other than your own: Water Polo (10)
Score: 47.5/70 – Looks like Nick will at least stay out of the doghouse with a respectable showing, but let’s see if Greer can edge him out in the competition.
 
Greer Rosenbaum, junior coxswain for women’s heavyweight crew
Favorite athlete:  Air Bud. (0)
Pre-race jam: Whatever is on Jess's ipod, usually something fast with bass. Although she did once have a playlist full of really embarrassing Nor-Cal throwbacks. (Again, tough to compare, 7.5)
Secret talent: Kelly is a boss singer! (10)
TV show: Grey's Anatomy, Grey's Anatomy, Grey's Anatomy!! (Rough break here, 5)
Favorite late-night food: Haha, wings (Between Kelly’s “…” and Greer’s “haha” we think there’s a story here, 10)
Superpower of choice: Kelly already has one... she has the power to NEVER be cold. She will be in spandex and a tank when EVERYONE else is wearing longs, vests, ear warmers, and pogies on the water. (0)
Sport you'd play other than your own: She is jacked and from Cali... so water polo. (Looking at the women’s water polo roster, the Cali assumption is probably a safe bet, 10)
Score: 42.5/70 – So close, but yet so far! It looks like Modern Family was the wrench in the gears (hole in the boat?) for Kelly’s teammate, so Nick ekes out the win!
(Also, neglecting to specify human and real favorite athlete may have been an oversight on our part, so for that we apologize.)
Thanks for playing, everyone! If you have any suggestions for other couples/friends/teammates to play “For Love or the Game” leave them below in the comments section!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When freshmen Emerance Maschmeyer and Miye D’Oench stepped onto the ice for the final game of the 2012 Women’s World U-18 Championship in the Czech Republic, they were opponents. Three months after Maschmeyer and Canada defeated D’Oench and the United States, the duo will share the ice again, this time as teammates.
Maschmeyer and D’Oench are two of the Harvard women’s hockey team’s seven rookies, a group that is expected to play an integral role in the Crimson’s attempt to live up to its No. 9 preseason ranking.
“We’re going to have to step up and make a difference,” freshman forward Jessica Harvey says. “But at the same time, we’ve got a great group of veterans that will really carry us through.”
Harvard coach Katey Stone has confidence in the rookies’ ability to make an immediate impact.
“Sometimes it takes young kids a while to get up to speed—grasp the culture—but I don’t think that’s been a problem at all,” Stone says. “They work hard off the ice; they work hard on the ice.”
The Crimson rookies add significant depth at the forward position. D’Oench and Harvey are joined by freshmen Dylanne Crugnale and Mary Parker in adding to an already dominant offensive attack led by co-captain Jillian Dempsey and junior Lindsay Fry.
Crugnale and Parker, who attended the nearby Noble and Greenough School, both captained their respective club teams in high school.
“The team is very driven and is all about hard work,” says Parker, whose sister Elizabeth is a junior forward on the team. “No other team in the league is going to outwork us. The team and the coaches are like one big family, and [we] are all working together towards the same goal.”
Along with earning a silver medal at World Championships, D’Oench also captained her U-19 club team for two years.
“The biggest difference [in college] is having a team of equally dedicated players, across the board,” D’Oench said. “The intensity has picked up five notches.”
Following a series of preseason injuries to senior Josephine Pucci and junior Marissa Gedman, Harvard’s defense has taken a hit.
“We’ve got spots to fill now,” freshman goalie Molly Tissenbaum says. “I think more than anything we’ve now got a fire lit under the whole team.... We’ve got to work for the whole season because those spots aren’t easily filled.”
Freshman Abigail Harris, who co-captained her club team in Ohio,  is the Crimson’s only rookie defender. But the Crimson added two goaltenders, Maschmeyer and Tissenbaum, who will back up co-captain Laura Bellamy in goal.
“We have two good goalies that came in,” Bellamy says. “It’s just adding to the competition, and it’s going to make us better. In practice, it’s not only making [our]offense better, it pushes me everyday.”
Recording a shutout in her gold medal victory over the United States at the 2012 World Championships, Maschmeyer won gold at the Canada Winter Games for Team Alberta in 2011 and the Alberta Winter Games in 2009.
In late August, the goaltender was named to the Canada U-22 team for a series of games against the United States.
“Last year, I played away from home,” Maschmeyer says. “I played on a junior men’s team, Lloydminster, so I think for me the transition [to college] wasn’t as hard.”
Crugnale and Harvey both found the transition to ECAC play to be smoother because of their high school experiences. Attending the North American Hockey Academy, Crugnale’s academics have consistently been mixed in with large amounts of time on the ice.
Harvey, on the other hand, lived nowhere near where she played. The forward from Norfolk, N.Y. travelled to Canada four times a week just to play for the PWHL’s Ottawa Senators.
“I knew that the best hockey was in Canada, and that’s what I had to do to get to the next level,” Harvey says. “It was pretty rough on my mom and me to go to Canada all of the time, but it was worth it.”
That same kind of drive to excel will be key to Harvard’s success this season.
“Stepping onto the ice for the first time with a Harvard jersey on, that’ll be pretty amazing,” Harvey says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 3:14 had elapsed in overtime in the 2012 ECAC semifinal matchup between the Harvard women’s hockey team and St. Lawrence, Saints forward Kelly Sabatine snuck the puck past then-junior goaltender Laura Bellamy to propel her team into the ECAC finals with a 2-1 win.
For the Crimson, the goal marked the abrupt end of an otherwise successful campaign in which Harvard climbed as high as No. 7 in national polls on its way to a record of 22-9-1, including a 17-4-1 mark in conference play.
According to Crimson players, a chance at retribution for last year’s disappointing finish is added motivation for a team hoping to take its second national championship in program history—a feat Harvard accomplished in 1999.
“Every year we think about what we did last year and how we can improve upon it,” senior Hilary Hayssen says. “For all of us, every year that our season has been cut short—the last three—has provided motivation.”
With the graduation of just one senior—captain Alisa Baumgartner’12—from a squad that ended the 2011-12 regular season ranked second in the ECAC, the Crimson looks poised to pick up where it left off and make a run at both the conference and national championships.
“I think the kids are excited,” Harvard coach Katey Stone says. “They’ve worked so hard; they’ve been focused; and they come prepared every day. [We’re] pretty excited to get going and see what they’re capable of.”
The Crimson—which was picked to finish in the No. 2 spot by the ECAC coaches’ poll and currently claims a No. 9 national ranking—returns its top two scorers in co-captain Jillian Dempsey and junior forward Lyndsey Fry. The duo combined for 49 goals and 41 assists last year, with the senior holding a slight edge in both statistical categories.
Dempsey—who was a finalist for last year’s ECAC Player of the Year award—nabbed one of six spots on the 2012-13 preseason all-conference team.
After amassing an impressive .919 save percentage on 679 stops last season, Bellamy, a co-captain, will see plenty of action between the pipes again this year. Unlike last year, when she was the only goaltender on the roster, she will likely have help from freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer—one of seven rookies on the Harvard squad.
Freshman forwards Miye D’Oench and Mary Parker will also likely have an immediate impact on the ice.
“We have four great lines, and a lot more depth this year than last year,” Dempsey says. “There’s a sense of urgency in going to the net and finishing. We’re hungry, so we’re going to be going to the net hard and getting shots from everywhere.”
Although the Crimson returns 14 of its players from last season, adding some much—needed experience to its youthful 2011-12 roster, Harvard will play out its 2012-13 campaign without last year’s alternate captain—defenseman Josephine Pucci—or defenseman Marissa Gedman, who are both out for the year due to injury.
“It’s really tough, especially when you lose not only two kids who are great kids and great players but [are also playing] strong roles in the program,” Stone says. “September was really rocky for everyone.”
“The silver lining was that, when we started Oct. 5, we already knew they were gone,” she continues. “And there was no grey area. This is who we have; let’s go. From that moment on, or maybe even a little bit before, everyone knew that [we needed to] bring ourselves together and…make this thing happen.”
Among those looking to step up to help fill the void left by Pucci and Gedman—who led Harvard defensemen with 16 and 19 assists, respectively—will be sophomores Michelle Picard and Sarah Edney, both of whom played key roles for the Crimson last season.
On the tail of its third straight year at the top of the ECAC regular-season standings, No. 2 Cornell remains the team to beat in conference play. Although St. Lawrence spoiled the Big Red’s ECAC championship hopes last year with a 3-1 victory in the ECAC finals, Cornell has claimed two of the last three league titles.
Meanwhile, the Crimson has yet to make it past the conference semifinals since taking home the 2008 ECAC crown with a victory over the Saints in overtime. Harvard’s drought in regular season titles is one year shorter, dating back to 2009.
“In order to get [to our goal of winning a national championship], one step would be to win the ECAC and the Ivy League,” Bellamy says. “There’s no Ivy championship [in women’s hockey]; it’s just by record. But if we can beat Cornell, that’s one step toward our goal. They’re our biggest competition.”
Overall, the Crimson once again boasts one of the toughest schedules in the country. Of the remaining nine teams currently holding spots in the national top 10 after a poll on Oct. 22, Harvard meets five of them—No. 2 Cornell, No. 3 Boston University, No. 4 Clarkson, No. 6 Boston College, and No. 7 Northeastern—at least once in the regular season, starting with the Terriers on Nov. 18.
This year, all four Boston-area schools look to be early contenders for the national crown, effectively endowing the annual Beanpot—a mid-season tournament that pits Harvard, BU, BC, and Northeastern against each other in a single-elimination bracket—with added importance.
“We have these big games like Cornell or the Beanpot, but Coach always talks about taking [the season] game by game,” says senior forward Kaitlin Spurling, one of nine Harvard players who earned 10 or more assists last season. “Every game matters, and I think that’s really key going into the season. It doesn’t matter who our opponent is…. The biggest game is the next game.”
And despite a challenging road ahead for the Crimson, starting with its first conference matchup on Oct. 26 at Quinnipiac, Stone is optimistic about her team’s ability to perform in those big games.
“[The ECAC looks] tough,” she says. “We’re going to have to be ready every night—as it has been for the last few years anyway—and play our best. That’s what we want to do: practice hard during the week and play our best during the weekends. And we’ll see where that takes us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This year it feels like we are really well prepared—almost like we have done it before,” senior forward Margaret Chute says.
The Crimson seniors certainly have. The group, which has played together since arriving in Cambridge back in 2009, has devoted the last three years to breaking into the pinnacle of collegiate hockey.
While coming tantalizingly close, the seniors of this year’s squad have yet to secure a berth to the NCAA semifinals, affectionately nicknamed the Frozen Four. But the confidence projected by Chute speaks to the belief of a team that draws from a reservoir of experience.
Chute and her cohort represent a wide spectrum of on-ice ability, with each of the four positions represented.
Bursting onto the scene in 2009, the rookies immediately made noise. Goaltender Laura Bellamy’s 1.68 goals-against average was good for No. 10 nationally, while forward Jillian Dempsey finished second on the Crimson and among ECAC freshman with 27 points.
The class built on that momentum going forward. As a sophomore, defender Josephine Pucci topped the team with a + 24 rating. And last season, the class of 2013 combined for 33 percent of the assists on a Harvard offense that was ranked seventh in the nation, largely due to Dempsey who broke out with an 11-game point-scoring streak.
Throughout its first three years, the group improved its already impressive résumé with a smattering of ECAC Player of the Month awards and national team appearances.
“[The seniors have] set a standard for what’s expected to all these young kids,” Harvard coach Katey Stone says.
But the numbers and praise alone don’t do enough to explain the contribution of this year’s senior class.
A microcosm of Crimson hockey, the group just clicks—perhaps too well, as their social preferences suggest.
“It’s the five days we have apart the whole year,” says Bellamy, referring to the squad’s shortened winter break. “And we want to spend them together.”
Despite having lost Pucci to injury, the group remains large and diverse, with six seniors making up nearly a third of the team.
“Collectively, we bring a lot because of that uniqueness between everyone,” forward Kaitlin Spurling says. “Together, we can all mentor the younger kids because we all are similar in some way to them and have different qualities that match theirs.”
These qualities are embodied by the team’s co-captains, Dempsey, the team’s leading scorer, and Bellamy, whose .919 save percentage propelled Harvard to sustained stints in the USCHO rankings a season ago.
Growing into the senior role does not appear to provoke any apprehension among the familiar bunch.
When asked how hockey has shaped her experience, Bellamy immediately responds, “It is my experience.”
After all, despite having just one senior on the team last season, the Crimson found success in most phases of the game, finishing with the second-best record in the deepest league in the country.
“You can talk all you want, but it does so much more when we can lead by example,” Dempsey says.  “It doesn’t always have to be goals. It’s some of those little things like [blocking a shot] where people just play gritty.”
According to the seniors, Stone—who also serves as coach of the U.S. national team—is one of the best at making sure that the team does those little things.
“We definitely take pride in the jersey we wear,” Bellamy says. “And a lot of that is credit to Coach Stone.”
Stone, women’s college hockey’s winningest coach, brings her own share of experience to the squad with 18 years behind the Harvard bench.
Defender Hilary Hayssen describes how, in a juniors-only meeting before last season, Stone revealed just how much confidence she had in the unit.
While the bounce of the puck will ultimately decide the team’s fate this year, the visibly excited seniors realize the importance of the preparation process.
“The ultimate goal is a national championship,” defender Kelsey Romatoski says. “Four years in the making. This is an experienced group we have right here, so we are pretty much ready for anything.”
Yet the road that has led to this moment cannot translate into complacency.
“[The seniors] are very smart; they know the game,” Stone says. “It’s time for them to step up and execute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forward Lyndsey Fry and sophomore defender Michelle Picard are used to taking the ice for Harvard women’s hockey coach Katey Stone in the Crimson’s red and white uniforms. But next month, the duo will be adding a third color to their jerseys when Stone sends them on the ice: blue.
Fry and Picard will travel to Vantaa, Finland, to represent the United States in the Four Nations Cup, a tournament that will pit the Americans against the Finnish, Canadian, and Swedish national teams. Stone serves as the squad’s head coach and led the team to a silver medal in last year’s competition.
“The way [Stone] coaches is consistent,” says co-captain Jillian Dempsey, who has represented the U.S. under Stone. “What she does here [at Harvard shows] the same values she brings to the U.S. program, too. It’s the same mindset…. She expects just as much from us here as she does [with the U.S. team].”
Fry agreed with her Harvard captain, saying that she has not seen a difference in Stone’s interactions with the athletes she sees year-round in Bright Hockey Center.
“It’s not like she treats us as her Harvard kids,” the forward says. “She treat us like her ‘U.S.A. kids.’”
Stone has been involved with the U.S. national team since 1996, including roles in the U.S. National Development Camps and the U-18 team, where she won the inaugural IIHF U-18 World Championship.
In 2010, Stone was named the head coach of the senior national team and continued her strong record, leading the squad to the program’s fourth IIHF World Championship in 2011.
Stone believes the connection to the national team has been a boon for Harvard’s program, giving her most talented players a chance to learn in a much different environment.
“I’m very fortunate that I coach some very smart players [at Harvard],” Stone says. “And then they go to the next level where there is an abundance of ability. They’re the ones who always had the puck on their stick, so they might not have the same vision that you need. That’s the beauty of it–helping them see the game in different ways, off the puck as much as on.”
Fry and Picard have previous experience playing for their country. Both players joined college teammates senior Josephine Pucci and junior Marissa Gedman—both of whom are out this  season with injury—and Dempsey as the American U-22 Select Team swept Canada in a three-game series this past August.
Playing with postgraduate players on the full senior team for the first time, Fry says she is excited to compete in Finland next month.
“This will be the first real show for me,” she says. “I’m really interested to see the role that I will be playing on that team. Obviously, you want to give it everything you have, but I want to make sure that I do everything they ask of me, stay positive the whole time, and contribute in any way I can.”
In the series against Canada, Stone’s team faced off against two other Harvard players, sophomore defender Sarah Edney and freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer.
Regardless of the nation they represent, Stone supports the players that sit on her bench in Cambridge.
“[Edney and Maschmeyer] know that we want them to do the very best, and we hope that we can do everything possible so they can fare as well as they possibly can when they go to those events,” Stone says.
FAfter seeing her new coach and teammates from the opposing bench, Maschmeyer looks forward to playing for the same team.
“Playing against some of the girls on the team and Coach Stone…got me excited to come to school, knowing I was going to play for her,” she says.
Dempsey and Maschmeyer both believe their international experiences have improved their collegiate game.
“[The international game] is obviously a much different level ,” Dempsey says. “I play wing here and will play wing here this year, so I get to practice playing wing at a higher level when I’m with the U.S. team, and here I feel more confident.”
Stone believes that her players who compete internationally motivate the rest of the team to match their performances.
“Our program has always been about helping to develop [players] to be their best and to get to the next level,” Stone says. “And to have kids that have been in the [national] programs, be it U.S. or Canada, they’re perfect examples. They’re [there] every day; they’re ratcheting up the intensity and competitiveness of practice. You just can’t duplicate that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the 2011-12 season, the Harvard men’s hockey team’s power play was often marked by perfect precision.
With senior forward Alex Killorn and junior forwards Marshall Everson and Alex Fallstrom up front, rookie defenseman Patrick McNally behind them, and junior blueliner Danny Biega playing the point, the Crimson finished first in the nation with a 27.3 percent success rate.
The squad tallied a man-up goal in 23 of 28 regular season games and recorded a streak of 18 straight contests with a power-play score dating back to the 2010-11 season.
“The group last year was successful because of great teamwork,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says. “They shared the puck, they worked hard, and really there was no one person that we completely relied on.”
Indeed, each player on the unit had a role to fill. Everson’s job was to screen the goaltender’s vision inside, McNally’s was to prevent short-handed opponents from breaking loose, Killorn’s and Fallstrom’s was to attack the net, and Biega’s was to orchestrate everything from up top.
“We were able to adapt to a lot of different situations,” Everson says. “There were games when we’d score off the rush; there were games when we’d score off set plays. I think you just have to take whatever the penalty kill is giving you.”
But doing so will likely be tougher in the upcoming season, as Killorn has graduated and moved on to professional hockey. The production of the first-team All-American, who led the Crimson with 23 goals and 46 points last year, will be difficult to duplicate.
“I don’t think you can replace a guy like Alex Killorn,” Fallstrom says. “He was a phenomenal player.... We’re going to do all we can to fill the gap, but it’s not easy.”
To make up for the star’s departure, Everson says a number of players must become larger offensive threats.
“The way you replace someone like that is you need multiple guys to step up to account for the production that we lost,” the senior says. “There’s five or six guys that...[are] going to have to be impact players every night.”
“It would be a very difficult task for any one person to try to step into [Alex’s shoes],” Donato echoes. “But I do feel that we as a team can score more by committee. I think there’s more guys that are capable of having really big years for us. We have more depth up front, so we don’t have to be heavily relying on one line to score a goal.”
Among returning players, Everson and Fallstrom paced the squad with 13 tallies last year.
“[They both] had excellent, breakout-type seasons,” Donato says. “We’re going to need them to continue [building] on that and take it a step forward.”
Biega, one of the top offensive defenseman in the nation, scored 10 goals to go with his team-high 25 assists, while classmate Luke Greiner had nine tallies. McNally scored six—four on power plays—to go with 13 assists in man-up situations.
That type of returning depth—combined with an incoming freshman class ranked as the ECAC’s best by College Hockey News—has led both Biega and Everson to declare that this year’s offense is the strongest in their four years at Harvard.
And though it will be tough to duplicate last season’s power-play success without its leading scorer, the squad believes an increased emphasis on sharing the puck will allow it to do well in man-up situations once again.
“Success on the power play doesn’t just come from one guy,” says Fallstrom, who registered five power-play goals last season. “We were able to establish great chemistry last year, and just being able to work off each other and be creative—I think that’s what the key is.”
“I don’t think our mentality changes this season,” adds Everson, who scored 62 percent of his goals and had 16 points on power plays a year ago. “All five guys know what they’re supposed to be doing, and they’re smart enough players to be able to adapt to the situation and find whatever hole [the defense is] giving us.”
Despite the success the group was able to generate on the power play last season, Donato still says there is ample room to improve.
“Last year our percentage was good, and we did a lot of good things on the power play, but I feel we also had some opportunities to win hockey games on the power play that we didn’t take advantage of,” the coach says. “That’s the next big step for us—to...be able to come up with a big power-play goal when the game’s on the line.”
To help take that next step, the team’s two top returning scorers both emphasized the need to stay on the attack.
“Our line was successful when we controlled the puck for long periods of time,” Everson says. “I spent a lot of time this summer working on puck control and body positioning along the boards so in games we can hold the puck for as long as possible.”
Those types of potential improvements have the team confident that in 2012-13, the Crimson can be just as successful in man-up situations as it was a season ago.
“Last year we had a brilliant power play,” Biega says. “[It was] unbelievable. But I don’t see why we can’t accomplish the same thing we did last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though there may not be any NHL games at the moment, members of the Harvard men’s hockey team’s freshman class plan to make a name for themselves at the professional level in the years to come.
But before they get to do so, their impact will be felt on the ice for the Crimson. The Class of 2016 is heralded as the top recruiting class in the ECAC according to College Hockey News, and is one of the best in recent memory for Harvard.
Last season’s rookie class would be hard to top for any program, with five current sophomores drafted by NHL teams, but the incoming class rivals its predecessor in the talent of the group as a whole.
Headlining the rookies are two top offensive talents, forwards Brian Hart and Jimmy Vesey, who have both been drafted by NHL squads.
Hart comes to Harvard out of Phillips Exeter Academy, where he was named the USHR player and forward of the year. As a senior, he notched 32 goals and 36 assists in 29 games and was also named Gatorade New Hampshire Player of the Year in soccer.
Last summer, Hart heard his name called by the Tampa Bay Lightning, selected 53rd overall in the second round of the NHL draft, the highest for a Crimson player since Louis Leblanc, formerly a member of the Class of 2013, who made his debut with the Montreal Canadiens last winter.
“[Hart has] a real heavy shot,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says. “He’s more of a shooter in general, [and] he also can pass the puck very well.”
Vesey, a native of North Reading, Mass., was drafted in the third round by the Nashville Predators with the 66th overall pick. He looks to follow in the footsteps of his father, Jimmy Sr., who played for the St. Louis Blues and the Boston Bruins in the late ’80s and early ’90s.
After being passed over in the 2011 NHL draft after his high school career at Belmont Hill, Vesey suited up for the South Shore Kings of the Eastern Junior Hockey League last season, where he put up a record 99 points in 51 games.
“Jimmy has got good size, got great offensive instincts,” Donato says. “[He] is a goal-scorer but also very good playmaker.”
Additionally, the Crimson’s new offense will be supplemented by incoming rookies Kyle Criscuolo, Greg Gozzo, and Brayden Jaw.
“They are guys that are physically mature enough to step right in and have an impact,” Donato says.
Gozzo and Criscuolo both made rounds in the prep school circuit, at Avon Old Farms and Choate Rosemary Hall, respectively, before moving on to the United States Hockey League.
Criscuolo skated for the Sioux City Musketeers where he recorded 44 points in 59 games, capturing his team’s rookie of the year award. Gozzo produced 49 points in 56 games for the Omaha Lancers.
With the departure of former assistant captain Alex Killorn ’12—who recorded 109 career points—the forwards will look to replace his offensive output both on even-strength play and on the power play.
“None of us are going to fill that spot solo,” Hart says. “But as a unit, hopefully we can contribute to some of that scoring.”
Vesey has initially stepped into Killorn’s former spot along the board on the power play’s first unit, according to Hart.
Rounding out the freshman class for Harvard are defenseman Desmond Bergin and goaltender Peter Traber.
“Desmond showed great maturity for a guy his age,” fellow defenseman and captain Danny Biega says. “He seems to be really mature in his position, so I think a young guy like that is going to help us out a lot.”
Despite the depth of the rookie class, Donato is wary of the lure of professional aspirations. The Harvard grad noted that the current senior class would have been better if first-round draft pick Leblanc had not left the Crimson to further his professional career.
But for players like Hart, suiting up for Harvard seems to be a long-term commitment.
“It’s been my goal to go to Harvard for a long time,” Hart says. “I want to graduate from Harvard. I want to stay and develop and go to school here and get to know the guys.”
Part of the attractiveness of sticking with the Crimson is the bond on the team that has quickly developed for the freshman class, both with each other and with the veterans on the squad.
“I couldn’t be happier about the culture on the team,” Hart says. “Tommy O’Regan really stepped up in the sophomore class, getting the freshmen together in the first couple weeks, and everybody’s been really nice and supportive. I’m having a blast playing on the team.”
Though the rookies of the 2012-13 season are highly touted throughout the league, Donato believes that developing the total team is more important than simply recruiting top talents.
“I’m not worried about having great recruiting classes,” Donato says. “I think we’re worried about having great teams, and we’re hopeful that this group will come together with the addition of this freshman class and really mold together to have a great team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the 2011-12 season, expectations couldn’t have been much lower for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
Picked to finish seventh in the ECAC in one preseason poll and 12th in another, the team rode an NCAA-record 11 ties to a top-four seed in the conference playoffs. And from there, the Crimson continued to prove the prognosticators wrong with an improbable late-season run that landed the team one victory short of an ECAC championship.
Accordingly, expectations are a bit higher for the 2012-13 squad that is eyeing the program’s first ECAC title since 2006.
Pegged to finish third by both major preseason conference polls and ranked No. 17 in the nation, Harvard returns a stacked senior class and brings in a new crop of rookies that many consider the best in the conference.
“I think top to bottom we have the strongest roster since we’ve been here,” senior forward Marshall Everson says.
Everson plays a key role in an offensive attack that last year scored 3.12 goals per game—14th best in the nation—and boasted the best power play in Division I hockey.
But much of that spark a season ago came from forward Alex Killorn ’12, who led the team with 23 goals and 46 points. Killorn’s graduation leaves a hole on the attack that may prove tough to fill.
“It’s very difficult to replace a first-team All-American and a player of Alex’s stature,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says. “He had a great season.”
Despite Killorn’s loss, Donato is confident in the depth of his team, which returns key offensive weapons from a season ago like Everson and senior forward Alex Fallstrom, who combined for 58 points last year.
But perhaps the team’s top threat is captain and defenseman Danny Biega. A first-team All-American as a junior, Biega tallied 35 points in 34 games last season, and his 1.03 points per game were second best in the nation among blueliners.
“[Biega has] been an impact player all three previous years, and I don’t think it’s going to be any different this year,” Fallstrom says. “He’s come back stronger, faster, and better. He’s looked great this preseason, and I think he’s going to have a great season, both offensively and defensively.”
Biega, also named the top defensive defenseman in the conference a season ago, leads a Crimson backline that allowed 2.79 goals per game last year, seventh in the 12-team ECAC. But with the return of players like junior Dan Ford and sophomore Pat McNally, Biega is optimistic.
“I think the defense is actually our strongest position on the team,” the captain says. “We have many returners coming back, and the guys have really matured throughout their time here, so I think that’s actually going to help our team a lot.”
Anchoring the defensive line are a duo of goaltenders who split time a season ago, junior Raphael Girard and sophomore Steve Michalek. Though Girard had the statistically better season, allowing over a goal per game less than his counterpart and playing a critical role in Harvard’s late-season run, Donato plans to stick with a platoon system that he has employed in years past, at least in the early going.
The goalies along with the rest of the Crimson squad will be tested early in the season. Following the season opener at home against Bentley on Oct. 27, Harvard begins a stretch of six consecutive league contests, including a Nov. 16 rivalry matchup at No. 7 Cornell, picked in both preseason polls to finish second in the conference.
That contest is also a rematch of last year’s ECAC semifinal matchup, which the Crimson won handidly, 6-1.
“That’s always my favorite game to play in,” Biega says. “The atmosphere is second to none. I don’t think our accomplishments last year change that in any way. If anything, it makes you look forward to the game a little bit more.”
Harvard will receive its first taste of another elite conference team, No. 8 Union, on Jan. 22. The Dutchmen knocked off the Crimson in the ECAC championship a year ago and are predicted to repeat in 2012-13.
“They seem to do all the little things right,” Biega says. “Within the game of hockey, it’s just a matter of adding up mistakes, and they seem to minimize those mistakes better than most teams.”
Two weeks later, the Crimson opens play at the 61st Beanpot against defending national champion and top-ranked Boston College. With two teams in the tournament ranked in the top 15 nationally, Harvard is once again an underdog. The Crimson has not claimed a Beanpot crown since 1993.
Regular season play ends on March 2, after which Harvard will enter the ECAC playoffs in pursuit of an elusive league title.
For Biega, the playoffs and the 2012-13 season in general have added significance, as it will be his last in a Harvard uniform.
“All good things eventually come to an end.... I just want to finish the season on a note that I’m going to remember and be proud of,” Biega says. “But that said, I’d like to win a championship this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The horrors of Halloween came early for the Harvard football team on Monday as it went back and watched its first Ivy loss since 2010 unfold in advance of a matchup against Dartmouth Saturday.
“You tell them right up front, ‘This is going to be a very tough day when we watch this film,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “‘But at six o’clock tonight we are going to exorcise these demons and we are going to move on,’ and that’s what we did.”
Harvard’s first defeat in 15 games resulted from untimely penalties and turnovers and an outstretched arm that came up short of a first down to end the Crimson’s final drive. Harvard punted after that play and the Tigers drove the ball 90 yards to take the lead with 13 seconds left on the clock.
“We lost a game we should have won, and there’s no excuse for it,” Murphy said. “We just didn’t close the deal, with multiple opportunities.”
The Crimson had a 34-10 lead in the fourth quarter but gave up 29 unanswered points to fall into a three-way tie for second place in the Ivy League.
“You’ve got to be made of some strong stuff to bounce back from a loss like that,” senior Alex Norman said. “It was painful to watch the film but you’ve got to…use it as fuel for the next week.”
Harvard has spent this week making sure history doesn’t repeat itself and that next Monday’s film session won’t be as difficult to watch.
“We’ve gotten off to some fast starts this year, but our whole mantra this week is, ‘We’ve got to finish,’” Murphy said. “We’ve got to finish every play, we’ve got to finish every drive, [and] we’ve got to finish the game because that’s what we didn’t do. Despite all the great stats offensively, we didn’t finish well enough, we didn’t finish when we had to convert a first down, [and] we didn’t finish when we needed a touchdown.”
In terms of finishing, Harvard could learn from the Big Green, which topped Columbia, 21-16, on a touchdown with just over one minute remaining in the contest. The win put Dartmouth at 2-1 in conference play heading into its annual battle with Harvard for the first time since 2007.
“They’ve gone from a team that really struggled on defense to stay in games to now their defense is keeping them in every game,” Murphy said.
Through six games, the Big Green has held its opponent to just one touchdown three times and has not surrendered more than 28 points in any game, including a 34-14 victory over Yale and a 28-21 loss to Penn earlier in the season. Coming into Saturday’s game, Dartmouth’s defense ranks first in the Ivy League and ninth in the FCS in total defense.
“The biggest change in [Big Green coach] Buddy [Teeven]’s tenure over the last year and a half has been the development of their defense,” Murphy said. “If you can play defense, you can be in every game, and that’s where they are now. They are physical, they have athletes, they have a good scheme, and now they believe.”
The Dartmouth defense will face its toughest test yet Saturday as it attempts to slow down the third-best offense in FCS in terms of yards per game. In last week’s loss, the Crimson had three receivers with 100 yards and four players reach 100 yards for the first time in its modern era.
“[There are] just so many different weapons with [Harvard], and the quarterback, [senior Colton] Chapple, he just flat out makes plays.” Teevens said. “You watch what they do and how they do it—there is tremendous respect on our end.”
Dartmouth’s offense, which is currently ranked sixth in the Ivy League, will have to keep up without the help of running back Dominick Pierre, who averaged over 100 yards and one score in the Big Green’s first four contests but has been hampered by injury in the last two weeks and is not expected to play Saturday. Pierre is one of the two best backs in the Ivy League according to Murphy.
“[Pierre] is doing good work for us,” Teevens said. “He’s a good sized back, [and] he’s a powerful back, we would just like him to be a healthy back.”
Pierre’s absence puts pressure on freshman backup Brian Grove and sophomore quarterback Alex Park to move the ball against the FCS’ stingiest run defense in terms of yards per game.
“It’s hard,” Teevens said. “Nobody’s done it yet.”
Harvard’s run defense will be missing captain Bobby Schneider, whose season ended with a broken arm in the third-to-last play of last week’s game. The middle linebacker was leading the team with 43 tackles on the year, including 5.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.
Schneider’s absence only adds to the challenge Harvard will face when it steps on the field for the first time since losing heir place atop the Ivy League.
“We haven’t had a lot of adversity this whole season, and this is our chance to show what we can do when we are facing adversity,” added senior Kyle Juszczyk, who called last week’s loss the toughest of his career. “I’d definitely say this is the most driven this team has ever been.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s pretend that last Saturday afternoon at around 3:30 pm, I was hanging out with That’s So Raven, who told me that one of the following two situations was going to occur.
A) Drew Faust announces she is resigning her presidency, and after leaving their respective spouses, she and Larry Summers elope in Swaziland, where they plan to spend the rest of their lives living among native tribes. The happy couple are taking their wedding vows when all of a sudden the Winkelvoss twins appear and declare that Summers had stolen what was originally their idea to elope in Swaziland with Faust.
Meanwhile, back in the United States, Jeremy Lin runs into Justin Timberlake and has the following conversation.
Jeremy: Hey Justin, congrats on your marriage.
Justin: Thanks man, congrats on the new contract.
Jeremy: Thanks, luckily there are no strings attached.
Justin: An N’Sync joke? Really? The ’90s called, and they want their references back.
Jeremy: Whatever, cry me a river, man.
Justin: Who are you to trash my career? If it wasn’t for Toney Douglas’ unbelievable awfulness and Mike Bibby’s tragic death, nobody would even know who you are right now.
Jeremy: Well, that’s not what the Rockets think. I just signed a $28 million contract.
Justin [laughing]: 28 million. That’s cute. I’m pretty sure that’s what I tipped my waitress last night. Newsflash, Jeremy, $28 million isn’t cool. You know what’s cool?
Jeremy: A billion dollars?
Justin: Nah, man. Power. Power is cool. I’m out.
Jeremy: Bye, bye, bye.
Justin’s parting words—“Power. Power is cool”—stick in Jeremy’s head, leading him to make a snap decision. He ignores his current plans—which were only cooking dinner for Chandler Parsons, anyway—and instead retires from the NBA, gets on the next plane to Boston, and replaces Faust as president of Harvard.
Back at the wedding, Abe Liu suddenly appears and says he had secretly been there the whole time, disguised as the flower girl. He explains he’s now vice president of Wonderful Pistachios and was at the wedding representing the company’s new president, Adam Wheeler, who had worked his way up by claiming he owned the world record for shell cracking.
Liu begs the Winklevii twins to come home, saying their ads are an essential part of the company’s business. Wheeler, Liu explains, has an idea for a website called ConnutU, the world’s first social network for nuts. They only need a $100 million investment from the twins to start things up. Of course, the Winklevii readily agree and return to the United States only to discover that Wheeler and Liu have defrauded them of all their money.
Finding there to be no wealth in professional rowing, the twins live out the rest of their lives in poverty, future subjects of the documentary “The Social Nutwork.” Faust and Summers live happily ever after in Swaziland.
B) Princeton beats Harvard in Saturday’s football game.
When Raven asked which situation I predicted would occur at 3:30 pm Saturday—when the Crimson led Princeton 34-10 with 13 minutes to go—you know what I would have said? I would have said B.  Because everyone knows that a documentary about a pair of nut con-men would obviously be called “Cashew Me If You Can.”
But nonetheless, what took place in Princeton on Saturday was absolutely shocking. Harvard was completely dominating the Tigers when things escalated quickly, Brick killed a guy, and yadda yadda yadda, Harvard lost.
For the Crimson, it was a collapse faster than that of The Wire’s Barksdale empire, an ending more shocking than that of the Sopranos, a world more fantasy-like than that of Game of Thrones. For the Tigers, it was a feat more impressive than my referencing three HBO dramas in a one-sentence analogy.
Forget the perfect season that had looked increasingly likely every day. Forget being one of the best Ivy football teams of all time. Forget the 14 straight wins, the longest streak in Division I. Forget the program points record and the top-ten FCS ranking.
All of that was over. The fat lady had sang, the Giants had won the pennant, and Al Michaels was believing in miracles once more.
A team that had been the epitome of dominance for 399 days and 15 hours is now staring a stunning reality in the face—it might not even win the Ivy League title.
YALE AT COLUMBIA
Princeton’s victory wasn’t the only shocker of the weekend, as Yale upset Penn, 27-13, despite having to feature the double first name buddies–Logan Scott and Derek Russell—who came into the preseason as its third- and fourth-string quarterbacks, respectively.
This week, Yale gets to play Columbia, coming off an upset of its own against Dartmouth.
Only kidding, of course—the Lions didn’t win. They’re about as bad at football as Republican Senate candidates are at talking about the female reproductive system. But Yale is really not much better, and somebody has to take this one, so I’ll go with the home team.
Pick: Columbia 21, Yale 17
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
If the Tigers can win this, they face Penn, Yale, and Dartmouth the next three weeks, meaning they’ll likely cruise to a championship.
But traveling to Ithaca is always tough—probably has something to do with the whole “leaving modern civilization” thing—while Princeton will have to avoid a letdown after last week’s high. And if Colton Chapple can throw for 448 yards against the Tigers’ secondary, Jeff Mathews can throw for 600.
On the whole, the outcome will depend on which of Princeton’s two offenses last week shows up—the one from first half that couldn’t break into Crimson territory or the fourth quarter one that was more unstoppable than China’s GDP growth.
I think the former is far closer to reality than the latter.
Pick: Cornell 35, Princeton 28
BROWN AT PENN
I should have seen it coming when it barely squeaked by Dartmouth and Columbia, but I never thought it would get this bad. Seriously, what happened to Penn football?
A perennial title contender and preseason poll runner-up, the Quakers are now 2-4 after losing to the double first name buddies. Senior quarterback Billy Ragone, a 2010 first team All-Ivy star, has regressed faster than LeBron’s hairline and now features a 1:1 TD:INT ratio. On the other side of the ball, a once vaunted defense is now tied for second-worst in the league.
It’s weird, but Penn football is no longer a threat, and Brown should take this one with ease.
Pick: Brown 31, Penn 14
HARVARD AT DARTMOUTH
Remember that scene in I Love You Man where Jason Segel gets drilled with a golfball and yells “This is my nightmare!”?
Well, that’s what Tim Murphy was doing on Saturday while watching his team fall apart faster than Eddie Murphy’s career.
After last week’s debacle, the Crimson is going to be playing angry on Saturday, which means bad news for Dartmouth (quick, someone call Rolling Stone Magazine!).
Bill Simmons likes to talk about “Eff You” performances, in which an elite player or team—often coming off a bad loss in which people question how good said player or team really is—will come out and dominate to show people they shouldn’t be written off just yet. Recent examples include President Obama’s second debate, Peyton Manning’s 2012 season, and Eminem’s “Recovery” album.
That’s the type of performance I’m expecting out of Harvard football tomorrow.
Pick: Harvard 49, Dartmouth 10

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only three contests remaining in Ivy play, every match is crucial in the Harvard men’s soccer team’s bid to finish in the top half of the Ancient Eight.
The Crimson (2-8-3, 0-3-1 Ivy) looks to regain its momentum and earn its first victory of conference play as it takes on Dartmouth (7-6-0, 3-1-0) in Hanover, N.H., on Saturday afternoon.
The match will be no easy feat for Harvard, as the Big Green sits just one point out of first place and is looking to defend its title as Ivy League co-champions this season.
“Dartmouth is a big, physical team that is always difficult to play against,” co-captain Richard Smith said. “They always work very hard and have some big technical players as well, so it is always a battle against them. It is never an easy game.”
The Crimson has seen its fair share of highs and lows over the past week, earning its second win of the season against crosstown rival Boston University in double overtime on Tuesday night. Its situation was then reversed on Saturday afternoon, as it fell, 2-1, in double overtime to Princeton in a tight conference contest.
The results seem to reflect the story of the season for the Harvard squad. While it has performed well on the field, the final score has often not reflected the strength of its play. The team has dropped all but two of its losses by just one goal. Although the Crimson has carried seven of its matches into overtime play, the squad has gone 1-3-3 in these contests.
“Losing in double overtime…has unfortunately been a recurring thing for our season,” Smith said. “We’ve been very close and have probably been the better team overall, but haven’t been able to have that final edge to get the final goal.”
The Big Green is coming into this weekend’s matchup with some momentum, having defeated Yale, Penn, and Columbia in its last three conference contests.
The Crimson leads the all-time series, 42-34-9, but Dartmouth has had the best of its last six showdowns, edging out Harvard, 3-2-1.
Despite the Big Green’s strong performance in conference play thus far, the contest should showcase a fairly even battle between the two squads. Last season, the two teams played to a draw despite finishing on opposite ends of the league standings.
This year, Dartmouth has yet to play Brown and Cornell, who handed the Crimson two of its losses and are currently first and tied for second with the Big Green, respectively, on the leaderboard. Dartmouth edged out Yale for a 1-0 victory, while Harvard outshot the Bulldogs, 23-11, in their draw. Both competitors dropped tight contests to the Tigers in double-overtime.
“Every Ivy team is a good team to play against,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said. “I think [Dartmouth’s and our] overall level is the same. In the past years when we’ve played them, it’s been close, so I think it will be a really fun game.”
The Big Green offense has been strong this season, putting away 19 goals in 13 contests. It is led by sophomore forward Alex Adelabu, who is currently second in the league with team-high totals of seven goals and 16 points.
Junior goalkeeper Noah Cohen has been solid in the net for Dartmouth, posting 49 saves and a .754 save percentage.
The Crimson offense hopes to challenge Cohen and the Big Green defense, finding its strength this season in counterattacks and set pieces.
Senior forward Zack Wolfenzon and rookie forward Oliver White have led the Harvard offense, netting three goals apiece for the squad. Rookie goalkeepers Evan Mendez and Joe Festa have split time in net, but Mendez has started the last three matches for the Crimson, recording 36 saves and a .735 save percentage this season.
Although Harvard is developing offensive chances, the team must begin to put away its opportunities to keep itself in the running for the top half of the league.
“We haven’t gotten the results that have reflected our performance or maybe the results that we’ve deserved, but people are still committed to the program and our style of play,” Smith said. “The reality is we are not contending for the Ivy League title, but we are always trying to improve as team, always trying to get better, and we will be playing this game as if we were challenging for the title.”
“We are more playing for our pride right now and trying to represent ourselves well in every game we play,” Kobayashi added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having won three straight and five of its last six contests, the Harvard women’s volleyball team will look to climb further towards the top of the Ivy League this weekend.
If the squad can pick up victories against league rivals Penn (10-9, 5-3 Ivy) and Princeton (9-9, 6-2 Ivy), Harvard (8-11, 5-3 Ivy) will ensure itself at least a share of second place in the Ancient Eight standings with four regular season games remaining.
The Crimson’s hot streak began against Penn nearly a month ago at the Malkin Athletic Center when Harvard battled back from a 13-6 deficit in the fourth set to take a five-set win.
That win marked the turning point for a team that started the 2012 season 2-8 and 0-2 in Ivy play.
The Crimson has since gone 5-1 in the Ancient Eight, climbing to a third-place tie with Penn.
While the Crimson may have a hard time catching Yale (12-5, 8-0 Ivy), Harvard is in position for its best finish since it won its first and only Ivy League title in 2004. Since then it has finished no better than fourth place in the Ancient Eight.
In last Friday’s comeback victory against Dartmouth, captain Taylor Docter posted her 10th double-double of the season, recording 15 kills—a match high—and 15 digs while freshman Caroline Holte had a career high nine blocks.
Since losing to Harvard on Sept. 29, Penn has gone 4-1, its only loss coming to the Bulldogs. In its last game, the Quakers went down two sets early to Princeton, but stormed back to win in five.
Junior Kristen Etterbeek had a match-high 19 kills and 10 digs and sophomore Emma White added 16 kills and 19 digs. White leads the Quakers on the season with 197 kills.
Princeton, on the other hand, started off the Ancient Eight schedule on a tear, but has struggled in the past three games, falling to the Quakers and Yale. Still, the Tigers occupy second place behind Yale. Senior Lydia Rudnick leads the Tigers with 286 kills on the season and is first in the Ivy League and 26th nationally with an average of 4.27 kills per set.
“We are excited to try and go out and beat Princeton,” Kristen Casey said. “Everyone is tough—that’s the way the Ivy League is.”
Earlier in the season, Princeton beat Harvard on the road in five sets. Crimson players have used the loss as motivation.
“We’ve been talking about it all week,” Holte said.
Against Princeton, the Crimson will focus on stopping Rudnick, but also on playing its own game, which means balancing the attack.
“There is definitely a sense that if we can stop her we can be successful.” Casey said. “Still, we must focus on our own side. At any moment we have five or six good offensive players on the court. That makes us dangerous.”
According to Casey, Harvard has been adjusting its defense in practice this week for the Tigers.
Penn, on the other hand, presents a much more balanced attack, meaning the Crimson must prepare for attacks from a wide array of scorers.
“Penn doesn’t have that one shining outside hitter,” Holte said. “We are going to have to keep ourselves balanced in order to stop their attack.”
To match, the Crimson will also try to have a balanced dynamic. It will rely on the efforts of all of its members, particularly setters senior Beth Kinsella and freshman Hannah Schmidt. Holte stressed the setters’ importance to the team’s success.
“A lot of the time we forget to praise our setters, but they’ve been doing a great job,” she said.
While the back-to-back matchups at Penn and Princeton will present a formidable challenge for the Crimson, a pair of wins would cement Harvard’s position in the upper ranks of the Ivy League.
“It’s nice to be in the top half,” Casey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s that time of year again.
After competing in five tune-up invitationals over the past seven weeks, the Harvard cross country team will finally toe the line this weekend at Princeton’s West Windsor Fields for the Heptagonal Championships. Alongside the Crimson will be its seven Ivy League adversaries, each vying to become the conference’s 2012 champions.
“The Heps are a storied tradition with so much history,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “There’s nothing quite like going against your peer institutions…. There’s a tremendous amount of excitement right now with our student-athletes.”
“It’s a bit more personal running against the other Ivy’s,” junior Maksim Korolev added.
On the men’s side, Korolev and classmate James Leakos are expected to lead the way for the Crimson at Heps. After capturing first and second places, respectively, at the Harvard-Yale dual meet early in the season, the juniors were the first and fourth Ivy runners at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, which featured seven of the conference’s eight squads.
“I’m looking for [Korolev and Leakos] to go out there [at Heps] and compete hard and leave it all out there,” Saretsky said. “Obviously, they’re in great shape and they’ve done the work. Now it’s time for the fun part.”
At last year’s Heptagonal Championships, both Korolev and Leakos, along with a number of the squad’s other top runners, were unable to compete due to injuries that they sustained in the middle of the season. The decimated Harvard squad sputtered to a seventh-place finish in last year’s installment of the storied meet. This season, Saretsky has tweaked the team’s training regimen, going as far as holding runners out of competition at various meets.
Korolev and Leakos will need to turn in strong performances for Harvard to have any chance of upsetting Columbia, which is coming into the meet ranked No. 10 in the latest USTFCCCA poll, the highest mark in program history. Lions senior Mike Murphy and Princeton junior Alejandro Arroyo Yamin will likely be battling Korolev and Leakos in the lead pack.
“It’s pretty clear-cut who the favorites are,” Saretsky said. “Everyone has kind of shown their cards at this point, so we’ve got a sense of who the top teams are shaping up to be.”
Though the pair of juniors will likely lead the way for Harvard on Saturday, the squad’s next three scoring runners will be just as crucial in determining where the Crimson lies in the final Ivy League standings.
At the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, freshmen Tom Purnell and Billy Gaudreau and junior Kurt Ruegg were the Crimson’s other scorers, with Purnell crossing the finish line 43 seconds after Leakos. If Harvard manages to narrow that gap, it will have a chance to defeat the Lions and Tigers, who topped the Crimson by 347 and 206 points at the Wisconsin meet, respectively. Saretsky believes that the drastically smaller size of the field at Heps will benefit Harvard.
“Having your five scorers close together and close to the front is the name of the game,” Saretsky said. “In a smaller field, it’s easier to stay connected and feed off each other.”
On the women’s side, Harvard is looking to improve upon its sixth-place finish from a year ago. Though the squad lacks any true frontrunners like Korolev and Leakos for the men’s team, it has relied on its depth to excel this season.
Seniors Samantha Silva and Briana Jackucewicz, juniors Morgan Kelly and Emily Reese, and sophomore Viviana Hanley have consistently formed an impressive pack for the Crimson. At the Wisconsin Adidas meet, the team’s first four runners all crossed the finish line in a 14-second span, which is especially striking considering the magnitude of the field. Though over 300 runners competed in that race, fewer than 100 will participate in the women’s race this weekend.
“All season, we’ve had interchangeable parts up front,” Saretsky said. “The keys to success are us running as tight of a pack as we can, really feeding off of each other and having a strong performance one through five.”
The Crimson will likely face its stiffest competition in Cornell and Yale, who topped the 23rd-place Harvard squad at the Wisconsin meet by finishing in fifth and 13th place, respectively. Katie Kellner and Rachel Sorna have been the Big Red’s best runners this year and are expected to compete for the individual title, having both finished in a two-second span as the Ancient Eight’s top runners at the invite.
“I’ve got a lot of anticipation built up for this race,” Saretsky said. “I can’t wait for that gun to go off on Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Captain Bobby Schneider had successfully made a team-high 46 tackles without a problem. He wasn’t so lucky attempting to make his 47th and will miss the rest of the season with a broken arm as a result.
Diving to stop Princeton quarterback Quinn Epperly on the Tigers’ second-to-last play of what would be a stunning, 39-34 upset of the Harvard football team on Oct. 20, Schneider’s arm collided with Epperly’s knee. As Epperly continued moving, Schneider was left sprawled at the Harvard 40-yard line grabbing his elbow.
The middle linebacker quickly got up and attempted to run off the field so that the clock would not stop for his injury, but he did not make it to the sideline in time, incurring a 12-men-on-the-field penalty on the Crimson which gave the Tigers a no-risk opportunity. They took advantage by scoring the game-winning touchdown on a 39-yard pass.
Following the season-ending injury, Schneider had surgery on Wednesday morning, according to Boston.com. Now Harvard will have to recover from its first loss since September of 2011 without its only captain.
“You lost a great football player, but most importantly you lost a great leader,” senior Alexander Norman said. “His impact on the team can’t be measured.”
The 139th captain of Harvard football, Schneider was a key component defensively in the team’s first six games and helped Harvard limit opponents to 17.7 points per game, the third-best mark in the Ivy League. Through six games, the Crimson has allowed an FCS-leading 57.8 yards per game.
“Oh, Bobby is a warrior,” said senior center Jack Holuba before the start of the season. “He is the most technically sound football player I have ever seen in my entire life…. He’s always the guy where I know if I get a good play on him, I really did a good job and got myself in the right position.”
In addition to a team high in tackles, Schneider tallied 1.5 sacks and 5.5 tackles for loss this season. But for the Crimson’s remaining four games, Schneider will be confined to an off-the-field role.
“He’s still a leader, he is going to get our guys ready and prepared to play, and you’ve just got to move forward,” Norman said.
In addition to being named captain before the start of the season, Schneider gained more responsibiliy on the gridiron in 2012 following the graduation of captain Alex Gedeon ’12. Also a middle linebacker, Gedeon’s 92 tackles were a team-best a year ago. In 10 games in the 2011 season, Schneider had 40 tackles, less than he had tallied through six games before his season-ending injury Saturday.
According to Boston.com. a duo of players will share time at the middle linebacker position: sophomore Jake Lindsey and freshman Eric Medes.
Schneider’s loss is yet another in a growing list of injuries for the Crimson. Sophomores right tackle Will Whitman and wide receiver and kick returner Seitu Smith were both sidelined for the rest of the year as well.
Schneider’s broken arm marks the first season-ending injury to a key defensive player.
“We’ve just got to actually use his loss as more fuel to play well next week,” Norman said.

October 24, 1924: Eliot Predicts Race Suicide in Talk To Harvard Dames
"Is marriage the most important thing in life?" was the question discussed by President Eliot at a meeting of the Harvard Dames held yesterday afternoon at Phillips Brooks House.
"I have asked many young men and women this question", said President Eliot, "and the majority say 'Yes'. But there is a growing number of young women who desire to have an independent life with intellectual and financial freedom. I cannot say that I consider this career better than the career of motherhood."
October 26, 1939: Invading Indian Demands Room in Stoughton
Ughing something about an ancient charter entitling Indians to free lodging in Stoughton Hall, an early arrival from Hanover last night attempted to force his way into the Yardling room of David B. Shaw in Stoughton.
The Indian, who said his name was George Washington Nopokum, had come to Cambridge to "watch my brethren wallop you white men." In violent and rum-inspired terms, the Hanover Brave claimed the right to stay in Stoughton according to the provisions of the gift of the bricks used to build the hall in 1965.
October 25, 1946: Horseless Carriages Back to Spew Flame
Children of necessity, a host of rare vintage automobiles have made their appearance on the Cambridge scene. No addicts of chrome and fluid drive their owners have cars that were built to last, and they know it.
These hardy, car hungry souls, unfazed by wear, have scooped up the cream of the 1929 used car mart and buy their oil with a reckless abandon. Thomas it. Morse '48, who operates from Lowell House, pours a quart of oil into his 1922 model T Ford with each gallon of gasoline and loves every minute of it.
October 22, 1953: First Lady of Quincy
A maid sweeps about the room emptying ashtrays and straightening chairs. The Deans have just left, the Harvard Dames will begin arriving any minute. The man from the museum is coming later with a choice of pictures for the living room. There are notes to answer, calls to make, invitations to accept or postpone.
And if there should be a little time in the evening to relax and look over the children's homework, Mrs. Nathan M. Pusey considers this a slack day. Since her arrival in Cambridge early in the fall each hour has been packed with obligations, either social or domestic. "At this point, our outside interest is people," Mrs. Pusey smiles.
October 23, 1967: Parietal Committee Says 250 Back Co-ed Study-In
Members of an ad hoc student committee working to increase parietal hours claimed last night to have about 250 signatures of students agreeing to take part in a coed "study-in."
James M. Hollomon '69, a spokesman for the Student Committee on Parietals, said last night that in addition to the petition, his organization has been arranging informal talks with Masters, tutors and students, on the general parietal issue.

* "It looks like a German torte with all those layers. It looks like it should be eaten but that green fence makes it look unappetizing," said Sophia S. Pao '87.
* "That's a building in mourning," said former mayor and Cambridge City Councilor Alfred E. Vellucci. "Remember the old armbands that immigrant men used to wear when there was a death in the family? The black bands running around the building remind me of Italian funerals."

Turns out Harvard Square will have to wait another few weeks for its new concert venue to open. The Sinclair, which was expected to have its first show on October 30, delayed its opening to November 14, due to construction delays, according to the Phoenix.
The venue's promotional company, The Bowery Presents, promotes shows at several other local venues, including the Royale in Boston and TT the Bear's Place in Central Square. It was able to move the Sinclair's first nine shows to those venues. For shows moved to Royale, The Bowery Presents has released more tickets, including the first show on this coming Tuesday, The Meter Men with Page McConnell.
If you have already bought tickets to any of the first nine shows, no need to worry. All tickets will be valid at the new venues.
