“Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector” is exactly what its name would suggest—an app that lets its players collect cats. Developed by Hit-Point Co., Ltd., “Neko Atsume” has accumulated over 10 million downloads, making it one of the quirkiest and cutest phenomenons since “Hello Kitty Cafe.”
Once players open the app, sweet, bubbly music starts to play, and an illustrated scene of a yard appears, ready to be filled with cats. But in order for cats to come, food and toys must be purchased from the shop in order to entice them. Food ranges from free “Thrifty Bits” to the much more expensive sashimi.
Like “Farmville” and other similar games, “Neko Atsume” has two currencies—silver fish and gold fish. Silver fish are much easier to obtain, but the rarer gold fish can be used to purchase much more valuable items, like the coveted yard expansion (more room means more cats) or a cardboard house.
Over 40 cats can be collected using these toys, some of which are deemed rarer than others. For example, Guy Furry comes for only the glass vase and the heating stove. Senor Don Gato is partial to the Mister Mouse toy. Conductor Whiskers has been spotted blowing his whistle on the Cardboard Choo Choo Train. However, all cats, rare or common, will bring players gifts of gold and silver fish as a thank you for letting them eat food and play with toys.
The concept sounds almost too simple to have gained such widespread popularity, but perhaps it’s the simplicity of the app that makes it so great. Unlike “Farmville,” players won’t have to worry about opening “Neko Atsume” at a certain time to make sure no crops have rotted away. Nothing dies in the world of “Neko Atsume,” making this app easy to pick up and drop whenever—no strings attached.
Or maybe it’s the game’s overall “cute” aesthetic. Everything seems to be hand drawn, with neat lines and warm colors. The cats get stuck in cake boxes, hide in tunnels, and bury their faces in sheep cushions. They bring mementos like small mittens or damp matchboxes, and players can take pictures of them and add them to the ever-growing Catbook photo album. It’s enough to make anyone say “aww,” or at least feel a little fuzzy inside as they take screenshots of their furry virtual friends.

Not many operas include the auctioning of a bearded lady as a legitimate plot point. Happily, the Harvard College Opera is performing one of the few that does: “The Rake’s Progress.”
In the 1951 opera, Tom Rakewell, a young man of dubious moral character, heads to London to sort out some financial affairs, leaving behind his loving, virtuous fiancée, Anne Trulove. He is accompanied by his newfound manservant, Nick Shadow, who encourages Tom to forget his obligations and lose himself fully to the carnal delights that London has to offer. After Tom fails to return from London, an undaunted Anne Trulove rides off in search of her enthralled fiancé, hoping to redeem him from the life of vice that threatens to claim him. Chaos ensues, with magical bread-conjuring machines, insane asylums and Faustian pacts all playing a role in the opera’s progression.
According to director Joule P. Voelz ’17, the opera is traditionally set in late 19th-century London. However, the HCO’s production will take place in a less clearly delineated temporal sphere, melding visual cues from different time periods in order to achieve a certain surreal, dislocated feel. HCO will also work a David Lynch-inspired neo-noir aesthetic into the themes of vice and decadence that permeate the opera, adding a menacing edge to the show.
The opera itself, written by noted composer Igor Stravinsky, is musically very complex and promises to push both the cast and the supporting musicians to the very limits of their ability. “No Word From Tom,” an aria to be sung by Anne (Asia T. Stewart ’18), is an example of the musically demanding nature of the score. “It’s a ten-minute tour de force for any soprano of any age, let alone a nineteen-year-old,” musical director Jake H. Wilder-Smith ’16 says. “There’s a century of opera in that aria.”
“The Rake’s Progress” is also noteworthy for its libretto, written by renowned poet and essayist W. H. Auden and poet Chester Kallman. “HCO’s committed to doing things in English, but you do lose something when you do an Italian opera in English,” Wilder-Smith says. Auden’s skill as a librettist allows the opera to be self-aware without being smug or ironic and allows it to retain both intensity and nimbleness.
HCO’s decision to perform “The Rake’s Progress” is an ambitious one that will, with a little bit of luck, bring out the best in its enormously talented cast and crew while allowing viewers to enjoy an acclaimed modern opera. “The Rake’s Progress” will run from Feb. 3 to Feb. 6 at the Agassiz Theater.

“Is it because I’m a sexist, egoistical, lying, hypocritical bigot?” Franklin Hart Jr. says as he is shot, lassoed, and poisoned in three of his poorly treated workers’ fantasies. Hart is spot-on in his judgment of himself in their heads—and perhaps spot-on about many of the men in the 1960s and ’70s. Inspired by the fight for wage equality and the feminist movement, Jane Fonda created the film “9 to 5” in 1980. Twenty-eight years later, “9 to 5” was brought to life as a Broadway musical composed by Dolly Parton. And now, the MIT Musical Theatre Guild’s “9 to 5,” filled with hilarity, love, and feminist messages, is running Jan. 29 to Feb. 6 at MIT’s La Sala de Puerto Rico. Despite a few technical issues along the way, the MIT Musical Theatre Guild builds a whirlwind of humor and tension in “9 to 5,” thanks to a strong cast, expert costuming, and quality scenery.
“9 to 5” follows three women, battered by the sexist banter and unequal treatment that follows them and others in their everyday lives, who work at a company called Consolidated. Violet Newstead (Hallie Voulgaris) is an ambitious single mother whose well-deserved promotion continually eludes her at the hands of her sexist boss, Hart (Geoff Hegg), who is convinced that his “girl” will never be “one of the boys.” Doralee Rhodes (Chamille Lescott), despite being happily married, is constantly sexually harassed by Hart. Finally, Judy Bernly (Carrie Fowle), a newly divorced, naive, and sweet woman, is just starting off at Consolidated, unaware of the trouble in which she and her coworkers are about to entangle themselves. Desperate to avoid arrest after nearly murdering Hart, the three kidnap their boss, hoist him up in his canopy bed, and hold him hostage for a month as they transform the workplace into a more happy, healthy, and productive environment where women are treated equally and receive the fair share that they deserve.
Although the actors begin the musical by singing slightly off-key at the high notes and dancing off-beat at times, they generally give strong performances. Lescott is bold and unabashed as her character attempts to connect with her coworkers but also vulnerable and hurt when they rebut her efforts. In the song “Get Out and Stay Out,” Fowle strongly develops Bernly’s newfound ambition and independence while retaining her sweet and wide-eyed nature. Hegg and Noelle Colant, who plays coworker Roz Keith, are both hilarious in their roles as they lust over characters they cannot have: In her love song to Hart, Colant crawls on the stage, adding the perfect touch of hysteria to the comical and purposefully awkward performance. Meanwhile, the background actors, who dance, sing, and bustle along in the workplace, create an immersive environment onstage. This effect was especially evident in “Potion Notion,” as Newstead dreams of becoming a magical princess—poofy gold dress and all. In Newstead’s fantasy, as she administers the poison to Hart’s coffee, the background actors smile maniacally at the audience, creating a feeling of delirium.
This cohesiveness extends to the scenery and costumes, despite a few bumps along the way. The MIT Musical Theatre Guild employs a simple set: desks serve as beds, makeshift walls as bathroom doors or elevators. Many pieces are transformed in one way or another, but sometimes with a glitch. Once an unfolding bed was caught in another piece of scenery, and another time actors had to fumble to pull a table backstage quietly. However, these hiccups are offset by excellent costuming. The costumes reflect both the musical’s time period and the character’s personalities. Newstead dons a pantsuit as she steps up to take a leadership role at Consolidated. Rhodes’s vivid pinks mirror her bright personality. Roz’s uncomfortably-tight, pinstriped business-formal wear reflects her uptight nature. And the cowboy outfits, sparkly skirts, and workplace dresses worn by the background actors all add to the musical’s polish.

In an early scene of “Mojave,” an idiosyncratic vagrant named Jack (Oscar Isaac) poses a philosophical question: “Do you believe in the duality of man?” Director and writer William Monahan constructs his middling latest effort, “Mojave,” around this very theme. The film follows two men—the aforementioned Jack and a wealthy yet morose Los Angeles artist named Thomas (Garrett Hedlund)—as they fall into a tangle of violence, precipitated by a night spent in the Mojave Desert. Despite its emotive cinematography, “Mojave” ultimately falters due to an overwrought screenplay and mostly ineffectual acting.
The film’s plot begins promisingly enough: A depressed Thomas journeys into the desert alone and captures the attention of Jack, who speaks in esoteric phrases and pries into Thomas’ personal life. Jack threatens Thomas, who then retaliates without hesitation, nearly killing him. Thomas is driven to murder the following morning when he mistakes a police officer for Jack and accidentally shoots him. A game of cat-and-mouse thus begins; upon his return to Los Angeles, Thomas must find a way to protect his success and family from Jack, who infiltrates his life in the pursuit of justice.
Although Monahan’s screenplay attempts to explore larger themes of fate, death, and justice, “Mojave” lacks the grit and eloquence that it so desperately seeks to express. Isaac is left to bear the weight of these weighty topics, for Hedlund’s unexpressive performance leaves much to be desired: He comes across as brooding and without conviction, despite attempts to portray his character as a complex artist drudging through the aftermath of a divorce and an unsatisfying affair. Indeed, the film’s few redemptive moments are due to Oscar Isaac’s acting. His manic eccentricity comes across as more believable than the roughly emotional gesturing of Hedlund. However, the little verbal flourishes and mannerisms he adds to the role (including severely overusing the word “brother” when talking to Hedlund) can also eventually grow tiresome.
Consistently impressive, though, is the work of cinematographer Don Davis. Davis captures the oft-ignored somber aspects of Los Angeles in a manner that successfully mirrors Thomas’ dissatisfaction with life. Not one bit of the city’s glimmer or seductive stardom appears in the film as the camera lingers on the mundane: a worn-down tennis court, floating garbage on the murky surface of a swimming pool, a dust-laden road. But despite these brief moments of beauty, the world of Los Angeles doesn’t quite meld well with the clean vastness of the Mojave Desert. In some moments, the disjointed settings seem to come from two incompatible films that have very distinct tones and intentions.
Additionally, certain editing techniques work well with the film’s cinematography. Quick cuts and dramatic camera angles emphasize and enhance the occasional brutal violence and stark environment. Patient, stable camerawork allows the viewer to stay present in the moment and fully observe characters. And yet even the most subtle of directing techniques fail when the subjects themselves––here, Thomas and Jack–– are frustratingly boring.

“Mojave” is not a terrible film, but it also fails to leave the viewer satisfied or transformed in any way. Structurally, the film would have more gravitas if it took the time to thoroughly examine the intensity of Thomas’ emotions—but because “Mojave” lacks empathy, Thomas’ motivation to protect his family seems inconsequential, even insincere. The viewer is thus unable to emotionally invest in the film, which makes for an apathetic and uninspiring ending. “Mojave” reaches for the boldness of crime thrillers like “No Country for Old Men” and Monahan’s critically acclaimed “The Departed,” but without the charismatic leads and taut dialogue of the former two films, it falls short.

In a sold-out performance punctuated by cheers and laughs, the Harvard Opportunes competed with seven other local college singing groups at the first Northeast quarterfinal of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella on Saturday evening.
“This year is the twentieth anniversary of ICCA, and tonight is our first competition in the region, so we are really excited,” says Diana Galeano, the ICCA Northeast Producer. As the only global tournament of collegiate a cappella, ICCA attracts student groups from around the world and is known for its competitive selection process. This year, in the Northeast region alone, more than 300 a cappella groups submitted videos of their performances in the preliminary round in hopes of winning a spot at the quarterfinals, according to Galeano.
At the competition, the Opportunes, Harvard’s oldest co-ed a cappella group, gave a performance that fused the styles of different eras and genres. “We have three different songs that were stand-alone, and we combined [them] into an eleven-and-half minute mega-song,” says Dylan R. Schaffer ’16, music director of the Opportunes. In its arrangement, the group wove together Michael Jackson’s “P.Y.T.,” Estelle’s “American Boy,” and a Kanye West medley.
“It’s a really cool idea, and also very risky, and we knew that going in,” says Ratna Gill ’16, a member of the Opportunes. “It’s risky because you get tired [during] an eleven-and-half minute song. Also, the songs are in different keys, so the transitions are tricky. We worked on those a lot, but it’s still difficult to execute them.” Despite the challenge, the group enjoyed its experiments, according to Gill. The Opportunes even replicated the auto-tuned intro of Kanye West’s “Lost in the World” through purely vocal performance, a practice that Schaffer says is unusual for live performance and very rare in a cappella.
To materialize their ideas, the group devoted extensive effort to practice. “We had a lot of four-hour rehearsals this week,” Schaffer says. “We went on a retreat last weekend up in Vermont just to rehearse for this.” Since the group was assigned to the earliest quarterfinal, which took place at the beginning of the semester, they also faced time management challenges and logistical issues. “We have a thesis writer, and it’s shopping week,” Schaffer says. “We actually sent out some of the music ahead of time in J-term, so people [could] learn it [and] come back ready to go.” Schaffer estimates that the group members trained together for 26 hours in the days leading up to the competition and put much more time into practicing individually.
In addition to honing their sound, the group also dedicated significant time to the look of their performance. “The entire set at ICCA is meant to be choreographed,” Schaffer says. “At our dress rehearsal we practiced everything from how we walk on stage to how we start each song, to the transitions, to our final bow. Everything is a visual performance, not just a musical one. Tying all that together, I think, is very important.”
After three hours of intense competition, the Opportunes were not able to advance further in the tournament. “We have no regrets because [those were] some of our best performances,” Gill says. “When we walked off stage we were actually shocked at how much energy we had. We all had a lot of fun….But the other groups are also really good.”
Boston University’s In Achord and Northeastern University’s UniSons, the two winners of the quarterfinal, will perform again at the semifinal at Boston’s Symphony Hall on April 17.

Harvard art historian Joseph Leo Koerner explored the art of the early Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch and its reception in his lecture “Beyond Bosch?” delivered before a nearly full Menschel Hall in the Harvard Art Museums on Thursday. The museums hosted the discussion in conjunction with their new exhibition, “Beyond Bosch: The Afterlife of a Renaissance Master in Print” which features a selection of prints from the sixteenth century to the present, made after Bosch and drawing on his style or his subject matter.
Bosch’s enigmatic, eccentric images—a tree-man with boats for feet or a party of merrymakers floating on the sea in a mussel shell—continued to fascinate viewers even after his death in 1516, and artists working in the cheap, widely disseminated print medium recontextualized and reinterpreted Bosch’s art for an eager audience. “We know a lot about [Bosch], but we also know very little about him,” Koerner said. “So what we have in the exhibition is something very precious. Namely, we learn from the exhibition, through seeing what people thought about Bosch, something about what that mysterious figure wanted to do.”
During his talk, Koerner discussed the many artists who imitated Bosch, noting both aspects of the painter’s art that later printmakers maintained and the facets that they changed. Referring to his choice to put a question mark at the end of his lecture’s title, Koerner touched on the question that these artists raise for him: Have we gone beyond Bosch? “That’s the question which I can’t answer,” he said. “Everybody can go into the exhibition with that question in mind—not only what is beyond Bosch, but did they go beyond Bosch? Did they make some step—artistic, moral, ethical, political? Is there a movement from the one to the other?”
According to Danielle Carrabino, the exhibition’s curator at the Harvard Art Museums, Koerner’s lecture was an excellent introduction to the selection of prints on view. “I thought it was remarkable how he can take an artist like Bosch, who’s so complex and about whom he knows so much, and condense it into a lecture that was both accessible to a general public and yet still held for a specialist,” Carrabino says. Because the exhibition operates on the premise that the viewer already knows who Bosch is, Carrabino says she was particularly appreciative of the information that Koerner covered. “I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction for people coming to visit the exhibition, to have that kind of background,” she says.
This exhibition, which was conceptualized and originally presented by the Saint Louis Art Museum, is part of an international commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Bosch’s death. Being a part of this worldwide memorialization is one of the aspects of the exhibition that Carrabino says is most exciting to her. Also of interest to Carrabino is the source of much of the material, as only seven of the pieces are from the Harvard Art Museums’ own holdings. “The majority of the works on display are from a private collection,” she says. “So this is an opportunity, really a unique opportunity, for people to see things that normally wouldn’t be available to the public.”
Carrabino hopes that the exhibition, located in the museums’ University Research Gallery, will draw visitors who will not only enjoy the pieces of work but also learn from them. Already, she says, several professors have expressed interest in working the prints into their curriculum for the semester.
Koerner emphasized the appeal of Boschian prints to a wide variety of viewers from the scholarly to the simply curious. In an interview following the lecture, he discussed the enduring fascination of the works on exhibition. “If you give these works just a minute of your time, they’ll draw you into them and they won’t let you loose,” he says.
The show, which opened Jan. 23, will be on view through May 8.

“Killed by drones” were the first words blasted out when Muse’s Drones World Tour came to the TD Garden on Jan. 25.  This grave opening and the grim setlist, which included the likes of “Dead Inside” and “Knights of Cydonia,” seemed to set the stage for a dark show. But somber fails to describe the rock band’s latest tour—in fact, the show was anything but, as the innovative video projections, charged performances from band members, and flashing, rotating stage rejected any illusion of a low-key, brooding concert. The floating drones, equipped onto glowing translucent orbs, did little to support such a faulty hypothesis either.
Muse is not the type to shy away from the histrionics. Hailing from England, the band has created a legacy of hard rock music with classical influences lasting over two decades, and drummer Dominic Howard once said that band members tried “to push [concert ideas] to the limits of the law.” Its last world tour quickly became known for its lavish effects, which included laser lights and carbon dioxide cannons. Despite this precedent for grandiose performances, Muse’s TD Garden show still felt fresh, generating a vivacious energy that spoke to the high-quality performances expected from the British trio while also exceeding the expectations of the capabilities of theatrical stage-craft. To that effect, Drones World Tour was a bold, novel, and wild experience.
The band played in the round, allowing the audience to circle the entire double-headed arrow-shaped stage. The set-up encouraged high-energy, dynamic performances to ensure an engaging use of the space—a challenge that the members met earnestly. Throughout the entire concert, lead vocalist Matt Bellamy and bass guitarist Chris Wolstenholme repeatedly dashed from the ends of the stage to interact with different sections of the crowd, as Howard stood stoically in the center. It was a move that created a sense of intimacy despite the venue’s scale—an intimacy that supplemented the sincere delivery of their songs. In fact, Muse asserted their ability as live performers, the only recognizable difference between the songs performed and the same album tracks being the cheers from the audience in the background. For instance, during “Supermassive Black Hole,” Bellamy hit the falsettos found in the recorded track with ease, before later switching to the heavier vocals required for “Apocalypse Please.” The singing and playing were consistently crisp, a rare feat for most live shows.
But the true showstopper was the stage engineering—a thoughtful, engaging blend of dynamic visuals and state-of-the-art technology. Video projection became a performance staple, and while employing high-tech tools often seems needlessly ostentatious, Drones World Tour managed to escape such pitfalls. Instead, the use of technology here arose spontaneously and naturally, astounding with a greater thematic purpose than to simply raise eyebrows and drop mouths.
The technology created a narrative for the concert: like the drones that appeared during the opening and near the finale as a bookend. It visually complemented the songs’ lyrics: like the vivid images of orbiting planets during “Supermassive Black Hole.” It even entered into a dialogue with the band: like the moment when Bellamy defiantly grabbed a nearby camera taping him while he belted out the chorus to “Uprising,” as if to further emphasize the song’s message of rebellion in the face of media, and thus absolute control. So when the video screens projected images of hands holding marionette strings, seemingly attached to Bellamy and Wolstenholme and forcing the two to move to the rhythm of the controlling figure, the illusion created was not only a stunning visual endeavour but also a move that possessed a deliberate, strategic tinge.
In these ways and more, the rock trio answered Boston’s call for entertainment last Monday night. Muse’s entire set was an action-packed performance, overflowing with ingenious technical design and brimming with musical gusto. As confetti filled the air during the penultimate song, “Mercy,” it felt as if the band had achieved something unique in its Drones World Tour, something which set a high bar for the innovation and fervor required to truly perform in a concert setting. Muse was victorious.

Florist’s debut album “The Birds Outside Sang” is a beautiful, deeply affecting exploration of trauma and survival. Florist, a folky sweetly indie pop four-piece self-described “friendship project,” is led by Emily Sprague and features Rick Spataro, Jonnie Baker, and Felix Walworth. They are associated with the Epoch Collective, a Brooklyn-based group of artists and musicians who are making some of the finest D.I.Y., or, as they put it, D.I.T. (do it together), music in the Northeast. Florist’s “The Birds Outside Sang,” released on Double Double Whammy, has exactly the sonic aesthetic one would suspect, given its provenance, but is also distinctive for Sprague’s original, personal, and deeply felt lyricism and composition.
Written in the wake of a hit-and-run accident that left Sprague severely injured and impacted her ability to play and perform music, “The Birds Outside Sang” is an album about wounding and healing, vulnerability, trauma, recovery, and growth. Sprague sings about the accident and its aftermath—physical, psychological, musical, and otherwise. In her lyrics, she also frequently revisits childhood—that period of intense vulnerability and growth—re-analyzing, re-contextualizing, and coming to new understandings of her early experiences in light of her burgeoning adulthood.
Sprague is a quietly shattering songwriter, and many of the songs on the album are evocative and intense. “A Hospital + A Crucifix Made of Plastic” is a particularly powerful example. The song opens with Sprague singing “I'm in a mountain lake/There are hands all over my naked body and I've got a sting/In my right side arm and it's deep into my veins,”—a gripping and intense transition from metaphor into literal and visceral imagery. The song concludes with an image of the accident: Sprague sings, “I am weightless/I am bone/I am weightless/I am bone,” vacillating between the two images of her bodily experience of the accident before concluding with the hard awful finality of: “I am asphalt.” It’s a stunning, haunting listen.
In its focus on Sprague’s recovery from this accident, the album overall seems to be addressing the question of what is necessary for survival. While Sprague doesn’t offer definitive answers to this question, she points to music, nature, and human connection as factors that allowed her to endure. The music itself evokes the sounds of healing and survival. Many of the tracks were composed and recorded during Sprague’s recovery and feature her determined one-handed piano playing, as her left arm was severely injured. The songs convey the complex realities of recovery, especially the claustrophobia of convalescence. In some sense, the album could be considered an especially poignant and painful take on the concept of bedroom pop.
But it is the world outside the bedroom, particularly the natural world, that is necessary to Sprague’s vision of survival. As Sprague sings in “Thank You,” “This beautiful thing happens every day it's called the sun, it's called my blood, and it's the only thing making us want to be alive.” In this, Sprague seems to posit nature and the body as being deeply and intimately connected. The will to endure has a deeply natural, physical, bodily component in Sprague’s vision. While in “Thank You,” Sprague seems to discount the importance of friendship to survival— she sings “I'm really grateful for the people I've met but that won't make me die any less”—throughout the rest of the album, she emphasizes the importance of friendship to one’s perseverance.
In the album’s title track, Sprague begins by singing about being trapped inside, listening to birds outside singing. She continues, darkly: “Inside my head /I'm a child again/but there's a pill for that/and I'll pray to death.” She moves from these somber meditations to a tender paean to friendship in the second half of the song, asking over and over again, shakily, determinedly, earnestly: “Do you and your friends wanna come into the field and watch the fireworks shoot up into the air?” Through this, she seemingly emphasizes friendship, community, and connection as something affirming, life-giving, deeply powerful.
This central theme of the album, the sustaining power of love and friendship, is also implicitly celebrated in the wonderful track “Rings Grow.” The song opens with Sprague per usual singing about wounding and healing in a poetic, imagistic fashion—here she imagines herself as a tree, with bark peeling away and branches re-growing—feeling herself to be both the dying bark and the developing branches. She then sings about the continuity of self in the face of change both wistfully (“If there's one thing that I believe/It's that the wind can make you a child again”) and more darkly (“If there's one thing that I believe, it's that my body will be the same wherever I bleed.”) On the chorus of the song, all her bandmates sing along with her, their voices blending together in wordless vocalization, lending each other support and strength. It is a powerful vision of the healing capacity of community.

I will never forget the look in my father’s eye the day he taught me about the effect that the N-word has had on him. We rarely had talks like this and I had only truly seen him angry a handful of times, but on this unique occasion both happened. In his life, he has only been able to attach hatred and denigration to the word. It has always created a visceral, intensely negative reaction.
Many think of the N-word as the most damaging word to the black community, but I disagree. Though I can understand why a person might not use it, the N-word has become for me just as much a term of endearment and brotherhood as anything else. In my opinion, “Uncle Tom” represents the most destructive term within the black community.
Uncle Tom is the single most divisive term in the black vernacular. Unlike the N-word, no one can possibly use Uncle Tom in a positive or inclusive way. To call someone an Uncle Tom is to tell them that they do not belong. The term creates an inherently exclusionary dichotomy where so-called “real” blacks sit on one side and perceived race traitors sit on the other.
Calling someone an Uncle Tom implies that they somehow do not meet the necessary threshold of blackness required to qualify as legitimately black.
Using the term Uncle Tom as an insult implies a series of assumptions about black identity. Most importantly, it implies a singular, narrow understanding not only of what it means to be black but also how a black person should act. While the specifics vary, the underlying premise is that black people should associate primarily or at times exclusively with other black people. While gaining exposure to your own culture and people is without a doubt critical, limiting yourself to a single community or demanding a specific course of action in order to claim your own identity is beyond problematic.
On an even deeper level, calling someone an Uncle Tom presumes an intimate understanding of another person’s internal thought process and relationship with their racial identity. These two aspects are both too personal and private to ever call into question or to disrespect by making baseless presumptions.
To complicate matters, I believe that the name should not even be hurled at someone who, for some reason, has chosen to disassociate from the rest of the black community. Anyone that would supposedly warrant the title of Uncle Tom does not need to have the insult thrown his or her way. If a person genuinely feels estranged from the black community, voluntarily or otherwise, signs of disdain from the black community would only further alienate them. This would only exacerbate the supposed problem.
If anything, the black community should approach these people with compassion and empathy. Without a doubt, being black in America poses daily challenges that make it difficult just to get out of bed in the morning. I can fully understand the attempt to escape this constant persecution and cannot fault someone for attempting to do so. While no one can truly escape this reality and the attempt to do so is objectionable, we ought not respond to this attempt with anger. Instead we must try to educate and reintegrate these individuals into the greater community and do what we can to eliminate the racial prejudice that creates the impetus to do this.
Put plainly, calling another black person an Uncle Tom amounts to no less than self-hatred. Someone who feels the need to denigrate another black person for failing to meet a standard of blackness clearly suffers from deep-seated racial insecurity.
I have personally felt the sting of being called an Uncle Tom, both to my face and behind my back from people I have considered friends. Having someone call you an Uncle Tom does not hit you in the same way most insults do. Many insults attack something that either you cannot control or has only a superficial connection to your identity.
But the insult of Uncle Tom attacks my entire self, my whole identity. It says that I have actively chosen to forsake my race, my being, my history, my family, and my legacy. It says that I do not belong. Worst yet, it says that I have ignored my shackles and opted to promote my oppressor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Years ago, I watched an interview with Robin Williams on YouTube, and wrote “Robin Williams is a bag of brilliance” in my journal because I was so amazed by his hilarity. I don’t remember the show, the interviewer, or even what he said that was so good. All I remember is that he was mesmerizing and he gave me this incredible feeling that everything was going to be okay. His art made me feel good. It gave me a sense of freedom. 
With the recent tragedies regarding David Bowie, Glenn Frey, and others, death remains a constant of the human condition. We see it over and over again on our news channels and feeds. In listening and scrolling, I’ve wanted to come up with some sort of word, some sort of well-crafted phrase that makes death a little easier to swallow. I want to say that death is “okay” or “normal” or just “the cycle of life.” I want to have that “okay” feeling I got while watching Robin Williams.
But the way we react to death makes it seem like it isn’t okay. We don’t walk into a funeral and say to those grieving “Well, it’s just the cycle of life” or “Hey, don’t cry, it’s normal.” It’s true that death is probably the most normal human event, but there is something in us that says, “this is really, really bad.” The right response often seems to be one of silence and sadness. It can’t be sugarcoated with art or wise words.
Robin Williams once said, “In America, they really do mythologize people when they die.” This statement is hauntingly true. I mythologize him. I think he was perfect. Like we did with David Bowie and Glenn Frey, when someone dies, we have a tendency to forget his or her flaws or failures. We utilize unmitigated superlatives: things like “He was the most gracious person ever…the best and funniest man to ever live,” “He was the best songwriter,” “The most wonderful musician.” We memorialize these people and turn a blind eye to their faults, failures, and sins. We want to remember the good in them.
The superlatives we know are rarely accurate. We don’t have to look at a news article or delve deep into the history of their lives to know that because they were human, they screwed up. They weren’t perfect because nobody is. But when they die, it’s comforting to dwell on the perfect things. Remembering the dead in this unrealistic way reveals something about our relationship to death. Maybe romanticizing those we have lost is our way of recognizing how they were intended to be, how we want them to be, which is alive. We see them as perfect people and this seems help us cope with the blow of death. Like death wasn’t supposed to happen to them because look how funny they were or how musical or how beautiful. Death reminds us that we each have a calling, and life has meaning.
And so the headlines announcing the loss of a public figure make us all stop. Life means something. A couple weeks ago, we all started to mourn and mythologize David Bowie and then Glenn Frey and others who made an impact. We all posted or read the posts on our Facebooks and Instagrams. Some of us just started thinking and writing, trying to make sense of it all. Knowing that it was not okay.
Death is a mystery and a reality. But maybe the only point in trying to understand death is to understand that this life has meaning. Some incredible human beings are no longer with us, but their lives meant something. They meant something to me and I suspect they meant something to anyone who ever engaged with their art or met them. And their lives on this earth, as everyone’s life on this earth, points to something beyond, because death is not okay.
King Solomon said that under the sun, life is meaningless. Not that life is meaningless in and of itself, but meaningless only under the sun. I think he is saying that if life really does matter, there must be something beyond death that gives it meaning. And this is why we mythologize. This is why we make people heroes and gods when they were really just like you or me (minus a Grammy or an Oscar). Death forces us to realize the significance and beauty and preciousness of life, however flawed.
And I know death is not a very sexy topic to discuss. Especially when Ted Cruz and Donald Trump give so much material for editorials it almost hurts. But I think it’s something to think about. To really think about. It’s a constant. It’s the one thing we know about every human. And I don’t think it’s okay.
So let’s go forth, friends, and live with the knowledge that every human life matters. Let us allow that knowledge to take us on a journey where we realize that maybe the brilliance of life doesn’t have to be a fleeting feeling from a YouTube video. Somewhere out there, maybe we can find a forever okay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard undergraduates shopped for classes during the first week of the semester, Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 have gotten their first taste of leading the Council. Between their previous UC experience and the platforms of their campaign, they appear ready to make tangible progress. We are confident that the pair we endorsed prior to November’s election is well-positioned to lead the UC for the year to come.
Throughout their campaign, Rather and Banks showed themselves to be a strong duo closely attuned to the pulse of the student body. Now, they have also presented three priorities—increasing funding for student groups, expanding administrative oversight of final clubs, and bolstering mental health resources on campus—all of which are important causes. Of the three, we are most excited by their first commitment: to reform the process of student groups applying for money via the UC's Bridging and Belonging grant.
Last year, under previous President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv Goyal ’16, the administration approved a grant of $21,000—matched by the UC to total $42,000—to encourage collaborative events between different student groups as well as weekly community dinners for small groups of students at local restaurants. But as Rather and Banks pointed out in a recent interview with The Crimson, funding opportunities through the Bridging and Belonging grant have been significantly underutilized due to the extensive process needed to secure grant money and a lack of knowledge about the availability of the funds.
Rather and Banks thus plan to reduce the application requirements for funding from the UC’s finance committee in the hopes that more student groups will seek a portion of the funding available to them to host collaborative events. We are impressed to see this productive thinking on the part of Rather and Banks and sincerely hope that the administration supports this plan of action.
Beyond its obvious benefits for student groups, the plan to reform the Bridging and Belonging grant reflects the spirit of a campus in search of more equitable social spaces. “The time period in which we ran and in which we will serve is unbelievably different than when Ava and Dhruv took office,” Rather said. “That has shaped our entire platform and our goals for this year.” Indeed, the climate on campus these days is one of energetic social activism. In the past year, students have supported a range of movements from calls to change Harvard's sexual assault policy to an enthusiastic opposition to final clubs. Increasingly vocal and eager to effect change, Harvard students today more than ever could benefit from additional resources designed to bring Harvard’s diverse community together more effectively.
While we have certainly been impressed by Rather and Banks throughout the course of their campaign and the beginning of their administration, actions are more important than words. Their plan to increase the accessibility of the Bridging and Belonging grant is a great first step. In the future, we hope to see similarly innovative and ambitious thinking as the UC’s leaders craft actionable plans for change regarding mental health counseling and sexual assault policy on campus.
Too often, the UC’s perceived irrelevance comes from administrative inaction on the Council’s proposals. We believe that Rather and Banks have a plan in place that will show the administration that it should take the UC seriously and respect it as an agent of change speaking for students.

QuadTalk, a new initiative aimed at expanding mental health resources to Harvard’s Radcliffe Quad, opened its doors Sunday night.
Five campus peer counseling groups jointly run the venture in the Jordans South basement of Pforzheimer House: Room 13, Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors, Contact Peer Counseling, and RESPONSE Peer Counseling. The groups rotate responsibility for staffing QuadTalk, with a different service in the room each night from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.
Rachel H. Star ’17, co-director of Room 13, said she generated the idea for QuadTalk after realizing the trek to Harvard Yard—where many peer counseling services are located—could prevent upperclassmen from seeking mental health resources.
“We think there’s already so many barriers to accessing mental health, people are busy, people maybe haven’t gone before,” Star said. “Whatever those barriers might be, the shuttle shouldn’t be one of them, walking alone at night through Cambridge Common should not be one of them.”
Star said she worked with Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich and other College administrators and student-leaders to determine logistically how to implement QuadTalk.
"Extending the services of the peer counseling groups to the Quad is a wonderful initiative for the community," Friedrich wrote in an email.
According to Star, QuadTalk marks the first time the five main peer counseling groups on campus have worked in concert to address mental health issues.
“Right now, the groups communicate, but there isn’t a sort of joint entity of the groups that’s facing the student population,” Star said. “We thought it would be really cool to come together and sort of bring all these resources as a unified front.”
Students can often perceive established peer counseling resources as being freshman-centric, and QuadTalk would specifically expand mental health resources to upperclassmen, Star said.
Roughly a quarter of the College’s upperclassman population lives in the Quad, which is nearly a mile away from the Yard.
Ayodeji B. Ogunnaike, a tutor in Pforzheimer House, said he often refers students to peer counseling resources, and that a close location would make it easier for students to seek help.
“I think it’s less of a barrier to get up and go to the Jordans basement than it is to get up and come down to the Yard in the middle of the night,” Ogunnaike said. “I just think if you want to try to get help to people, it’s usually best to make it as easy possible for that to happen.”
Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17, who is also a Room 13 counselor, said while QuadTalk was not a UC initiative, she did publicize the service in an introductory email to undergraduates co-signed by UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17.
Counseling and Mental Health Services at Harvard University Health Services also worked in collaboration with the College to find a venue for QuadTalk, CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis wrote in an email provided by UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker.

Freshmen waiting for placement in Harvard’s mandatory expository writing program found their schedules thrown into uncertainty after the online system designed to assign class sections experienced “unexpected technical difficulties” late Saturday night.
The freshman expository writing program, known as Expos, used to be required for all first-year students, and about half the freshman class still enrolls in Expos each semester. Students list their preferences for sections covering topics across a range of disciplines, and are sorted accordingly.
Leah C. Marsh ’19 described her “frustration” with the delayed sectioning process, which she said complicated scheduling for other courses. Sectioning was pushed to Sunday evening.
“I had to section for two other classes over the weekend,” Marsh said. “Because some of the Expos classes are Monday-Wednesday, some are Tuesday-Thursday, I had to think what are the odds that I’ll get into this Expos section, and then it’ll conflict with this, and so on.”
Planning for other classes was not the only activity complicated by the Expos sectioning delay. Siddhant Agrawal ’19 said he experienced difficulties in scheduling his work hours for the week. 
“I have a job in the library. I have to plan my schedule for the library and for my math class,” Agrawal said. “Given that I didn’t get to know about which Expos class I’m taking, it’s kind of rough to plan out my week.”
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke, the sectioning tool malfunction arose in part due to a “data issue” made worse by high usage of the same sectioning system across several large classes.
“The ground kept shifting,” Burke said. “You’re trying to eliminate conflicts so you can put students into a section, and at the same time another class was running [the sectioning algorithm] with 400 students.”
Burke emphasized that Harvard’s IT department is looking into preventing further glitches, and that his office is working with the Harvard College Writing Program, the office responsible for administering Expos, to consider alternative ways to section the course.
“We would certainly look at when things are run, when the deadlines hit, and what resources are on hand at the time to mitigate any problems,” Burke said.
Some students said they would have preferred if the sectioning process had been carried out earlier in the week to make course planning easier.
“Expos is a mandatory class that you have to take, so why not get that… out of the way so you can figure out the rest of your classes?” Matthew P. Bartels ’19 said. “I understand that problems do happen…I just think that there has to be a better way to do it.”
The possibility of earlier sectioning is being considered, according to Burke, although administrative hurdles remain for that sort of change.
“Speaking for myself, it would be terrific if we could figure out a way to do this in advance of courses’ starting,” Burke said. “That’s obviously something we’d have to work out with the College, the FAS, the Writing Program, and everybody else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust dismissed on Monday a group of alumni’s proposal that undergraduate tuition at Harvard should be free.
Last month, a group of five alumni, including five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, launched a campaign for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body. The group argues the size of Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment would provide more than enough money to subsidize all undergraduate tuition. They are also calling on Harvard to release more data about its admissions practices, and suspect the existing system could be discriminatory towards Asian American applicants.
Faust critiqued both proposals. She denounced the claim that eliminating tuition would make the College more accessible for students from lower-income backgrounds, contending that such a move would only bankroll the cost of education for wealthy families.
“The kind of program that is being proposed here funds a lot of students who we don’t think have need, from families who could and should afford to pay for their student’s education,” Faust said. “We would be using an enormous amount of institutional resources to subsidize families who could easily afford to support their children in college.”
Ron K. Unz ’83, who hand-delivered the signed petitions he hoped would secure the ticket’s place on the Overseers ballot, said he believed eliminating tuition would increase socioeconomic and regional diversity at the College.
“There is such a huge number of students in the U.S. who would never consider applying to Harvard. It’s beyond their imaginations,” Unz said. “If Harvard abolishes tuition, I think you’ll get a lot more true diversity.”
Faust said she shares Unz’s ultimate goal of making Harvard more widely accessible for students of varying backgrounds, but she added that Harvard’s existing financial aid program accomplishes just that.
“We do want Harvard to be accessible; we want to use our resources to make it accessible for people who would not otherwise be able to afford it,” Faust said. “And then we use our resources for a number of other really important things as well.” She listed a number of other ways Harvard uses its money, like funding research and hiring faculty.
She also defended the Harvard’s consideration of race as a factor in a “complex” decision, dismissing the adequacy of a purely numbers-based approach to admissions.
“We take into account this wide range of factors, one of which may be some aspect of diversity or race, but that would be alongside all these other dimensions,” Faust said.
Harvard’s admissions practices are currently under scrutiny from a lawsuit alleging the illegal use of admissions quotas, particularly against Asian American applicants.
The lawsuit is on hold pending the outcome of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, a Supreme Court case challenging the legality of race-based affirmative action. In the interview Monday, Faust reiterated her pledge to “vigorously” defend Harvard’s existing admissions policies.

Two Harvard freshmen who said a phone caller threatened and scammed them out of more than $1,500 recently launched a crowdfunding campaign to recuperate their losses.
The two students, Belén A. Mella ’19 and Amelia G. Miller ’19, started the fundraising campaign after they said they were the victims of a phone-based scam that led both of them to wire money to Puerto Rico.  As of Monday evening, about 100 donors, including some Harvard freshmen, had contributed more than $1,100 to the undergraduates—roughly two-thirds of the $1,670 lost.
The scam began Saturday afternoon, when Mella said she received a call from an unknown individual who claimed that someone was holding her mother at gunpoint in Mella’s hometown of Miami, Fla. The caller claimed to be involved in a “car accident” that injured his  “nephew,” Mella said.
Threatening to injure Mella’s mother, the caller demanded that she electronically wire $4,000 to Puerto Rico to fund medical expenses for the caller’s nephew, Mella said. The anonymous caller ordered that Mella not call the police or her mother during their conversation, she said.
After Mella emptied her Bank of America account and wired a withdrawal of about $1,400 to Puerto Rico, according to Mella, the caller said the funds were insufficient, leading Mella to call her roommate Miller, a Crimson magazine editor.
“Belén said to me , ‘I need you to give me $1,000 in cash and I can’t tell you why.’ I had no clue what she needed it for, but we are best friends so I said okay,” Miller said. Because of withdrawal limits, Miller said she provided $280 to Mella.
After completing the second wire transfer to Puerto Rico, Mella called her mother, who said she was safe at home in Miami.
Mella said she filed a report with the Harvard University Police Department on Saturday afternoon. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that the department is currently investigating the report and does not comment on ongoing investigations.
In the aftermath of the unfounded threat, Miller and Mella started a crowdfunding website. Dylan H. Wong ’19, a friend of theirs, said he suggested that Miller and Mella attempt to recover the costs through online fundraising.
“When I first heard it, I was honestly just confused because it sounded so ridiculous,” Wong said of the incident. “I didn’t really know how something like that could actually happen.”
Similar scams have become widespread in recent years, according to a recent FBI press release. “Most schemes use various techniques to instill a sense of fear, panic, and urgency in an effort to rush the victim into making a very hasty decision,” the press release states.
Mella said she is not the only undergraduate who has experienced similar scams. Pennypacker resident Karla V. Alvarado ’19 said she was also the victim of a similar scam last fall.
Alvarado said she nearly wired money to Puerto Rico but foiled the plan when she contacted her sister, who the scammer claimed was “at gunpoint.” Although Alvarado alerted authorities, including HUPD, Cambridge Police, and Northeastern University Police, she said the phone call could not be tracked.
Despite what they said was a traumatic experience, Miller and Mella said they wanted to make light of the situation through the crowdfunding page. In exchange for a $5 contribution, the two will give a donor “an original ‘I helped Amelia and Belén recover from a ridiculous phone scam badge.” For an extra $15, donors will receive “a DINNER WITH THE VICTIMS (including a Skype-in from Belén’s mom) for a play-by-play of the worst day of Belén’s life (and a weird day for Amelia)!”
“It was Belén’s entire savings account so it’s not a small loss,” Miller said. “We thought to ourselves even if the page doesn’t work, at least we would raise awareness about this issue so that people know in case it happens to them.”

Harvard students hoping to cross-register at MIT will encounter a simpler, online-only process starting Tuesday, according to information made available on the MIT Registrar’s website.
Previously, Harvard students hoping to take classes at MIT had to go through a bevy of logistical hurdles before they could register for courses at the nearby university. Tiffany H. Song ’16 described the process as “inefficient.”
The old process required students to obtain signatures from registrars of both schools as well as relevant faculty members and advisers.
“It was a little bit time-consuming,” Anita K. Lo ’16, who cross-registered last spring, said of the old process. “Cross-registration took place in person, so I had to get a form and take one to [Harvard’s] registrar and then also go to MIT’s registrar.”
The new application, which will be conducted entirely online, was designed to fix just these sorts of inefficiencies, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke.
“It started over a breakfast conversation with the MIT registrar,” Burke said of the move to bring the application online. Harvard’s cross-registration system for students between its own schools was already an online-only process when Burke and MIT Registrar Mary Callahan began discussions to change the process for Harvard students to study at MIT more than a year ago.
“MIT [provides] their course catalog so we [can] load it into our University course catalog, and then we... provide data back to them with what courses our students are selecting,” Burke said of the new system. “Both universities have been working on this for quite a while.”
Christopher D. Rodowicz ’18, who plans to cross-register at MIT this term, said he was pleased with the planned change.
“It seems pretty simple—you can just search classes by all the schools at Harvard and MIT and pick the ones you’re interested in,” said Rodowicz. “The MIT registrar approves it online, the Harvard registrar, and the professors, and our advisers all approve it online.”
Harvard and MIT administrators say they are satisfied with the cooperation between the two schools.
"I am very pleased that MIT and Harvard have collaborated so well in this trailblazing effort,” Callahan said in an emailed statement. “The time Harvard students will save is invaluable and the MIT faculty will benefit from receiving more immediate class list information.”
According to Burke, such cooperation in simplifying the process of cross-registering may expand to other schools with which Harvard has cross-registration relationships. Currently, Harvard allows students from some graduate schools to cross-register with Brown University and Tufts University’s  Fletcher School.
“We want to see how it goes with MIT this semester as an initial stage, and we have already spoken with those other schools about the possibility of coming in,” Burke said. “We’re not making any commitment at this point, but we want to see how it goes with MIT.”

Tensions between the Harvard Club of Boston and its unionized employees intensified this weekend after representatives from the union delivered a collage of worker photos to the Club on Friday amidst prolonged contract negotiations. A petition from Harvard School of Public Health students in support of the union also circulated last week, exacerbating the disagreement.
The photo collage, delivered by members of UNITE HERE Local 26, featured photos of the workers affected by changes to their  health benefits and retirement plans, which the Harvard Club enacted after their previous contract expired.  Local 26 serves Boston's hotel and food services workers and represents staff of the Harvard Club. 
This petition is the latest development in ongoing negotiations between the club and its employees, who have previously protested the changes to their health benefits, which they claim would raise out-of-pocket costs for affected staff. Separately, members of the union and the College’s Student Labor Action Movement rallied last fall for the removal of the Club’s rights to use Harvard’s name, saying that the organization does not fairly represent Harvard.
Harvard Club spokesperson Diana C. Pisciotta said she is aware of the worker photos, and claimed that some employees pictured were “very upset” because they did not know their photos would be used in that manner.
More generally, Pisciotta said Harvard Club managers were “deeply frustrated” the two parties had yet to resolve the contract.
Lila Goldstein, a Local 26 union organizer who helped  create the photo collage, said some workers believed the Harvard Club “unilaterally” changed health care and retirement benefits after the expiration of their previous contract, an action she described as “illegal.” Pisciotta denied the changes were illegal, saying the Harvard Club had the right to change the health plan to “something comparable or better.”
A separate petition circulated last week among students at the School of Public Health asking that the Harvard Club continue negotiations with union workers “in good faith.”
Christine Mitchell, a student at the School of Public Health, said she originally created the petition because she viewed union working conditions and negotiations over health care packages as a public health problem. She has not yet delivered the petition—which as of Sunday had more than 70 signatures—to the Harvard Club but says she plans to present it to Club managers sometime this week.
Unlike the photo collage, which only includes photos of Harvard Club employees, Mitchell’s petition details specific grievances from members of the organization’s staff. These grievances include changes in health care and retirement plans, as well as contractual changes in funding for legal and political action funds.
Stephen Cummings, general manager of Harvard Club, responded to Mitchell and Local 26 organizers  in a letter, writing that the petition’s claims were “untrue and misleading.”
Meanwhile, Harvard recently reached an agreement with its largest union, the Harvard University Clerical and Technical Workers Union. HUCTW members will vote on the contracts changes on Feb. 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor Randall L. Kennedy confronted questions about the intersection of race and politics at the Institute of Politics Monday evening, urging attendees to fight racism but not institutions like Harvard.
The event, which comes amidst intense debate and activism about race and inclusion at Harvard and universities across the country, was the first installment of a two-part series called “The Politics of Race: Can We Talk?”
At the roundtable-style discussion—hosted jointly by the Harvard Political Union and the Politics of Race and Ethnicity program—Kennedy spoke to roughly 40 attendees about issues including affirmative action, the history of discrimination in the United States, and recent campus activism.
Kennedy spoke at a time when waves of activism are rippling across campuses worldwide as students call for the removal of historical symbols and titles associated with slavery and racism. At Harvard, House masters unanimously agreed to change their title, a name some consider reminiscent of slavery.
Yale students are petitioning to rename a residential college named for United States Senator John C. Calhoun; students at Princeton are calling on the university to remove references to President Woodrow Wilson; and in South Africa, University of Cape Town administrators dismantled a statue of British mining magnate Cecil J. Rhodes after widespread student protests.
Meanwhile, a racially-charged incident of vandalism at the Law School—in which black tape was placed over portraits of black professors—intensified existing activism efforts. Police investigated the incident, which remains unresolved, as a hate crime and triggered students to demand better treatment for minorities at the school.
A group of students is also calling for the removal of the school’s controversial shield, which features the crest of a former slave-owning family.
In a New York Times op-ed from November, Kennedy criticized the Law School activists’ demands and  alleged that the black tape incident may have been a hoax. In the article, he called activists’ claims “dubious” and cautioned students against exaggerating the scope of racism at the Law School.
In an interview after the IOP event, Kennedy reiterated his beliefs that activists at the Law School were magnifying problems of discrimination.
“We need to avoid needlessly alienating people who might be our allies,” Kennedy said. “Unfortunately, I think some of that is happening at the Law School. Harvard Law School is not the enemy. And if you are constantly treating Harvard Law School as the enemy, you’ll make it the enemy.”
Kennedy said that while he is “very sympathetic” to activists’ efforts to challenge racism, they must take caution in their approach.
“I wholeheartedly agree with him,” event attendee Tynan G. Jackson ’19 said. “My agreement might be based on ignorance, but the presence of [people of color] on campus and their success after they graduate is representative of the truth that Harvard isn’t our enemy.”
At the Law School, however, student activists and several faculty members have publicly and vocally disagreed with Kennedy, penning editorials in The Crimson, The Huffington Post, and The Harvard Law Record rebutting Kennedy’s claims and arguing that he does not understand the realities of students of color at the Law School.
While Kennedy’s opinions can be controversial, Michael P. Richard ’17, a chair of the Politics of Race and Ethnicity program, said he thought Kennedy’s perspective at the event Monday was important.
“Quite frankly, I want there to be discussions that stir the pot,” Richard said.

In 2003, then-Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers announced ambitious plans for new residential and and academic facilities in the Allston neighborhood in Boston, across the Charles River from the University’s main campus. Although Harvard released an official master plan for its Allston developments in 2007, the University decided to halt construction in the wake of the financial crisis in December of 2009.
Three years later, Harvard released a scaled-back plan for the Allston area. This plan, approved in 2013 by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, ensures that construction will continue in Allston for most of the next decade—all projects have been slated for completion by 2024. Harvard developments approved by the BRA, Boston’s urban planning agency, include a nine-project institutional master plan that will create approximately 1.4 million square feet of new construction and 500,000 square feet of renovations, as well as a $1 billion science complex slated to house relocated parts of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Here is an update, provided for the most part by Harvard spokesperson Brigid O'Rourke, on projects both under construction and those set to begin in the next few years.
Chao Center
The Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, a 75,000 square-foot facility that will house the Harvard Business School’s Executive Education program, began construction in early 2014 and is scheduled to open in June 2016. The center will feature dining facilities, office and common spaces, and classrooms for the more than 10,000 executives who participate in the Business School program each year.
Esteves Hall 
Named for Brazilian investment banker André Esteves— who was jailed in November 2015 in connection with a corruption scandal— Esteves Hall was completed in March 2015; occupants moved in last April. Formerly named Baker Hall, the building, which also accommodates Executive Education students, underwent cosmetic, systems, and accessibility improvements. In December, Esteves was released on house arrest after just a few weeks in jail and he remains under investigation.
Gateway Project 
The proposed “Gateway project” will be built on land Harvard acquired in a 2007 land swap. The site was previously home to the Charlesview apartment complex. Although it was originally slated to be a “mixed use institutional building” by the IMP, faculty interest in the building has initiated a discussion among University administrators about whether it should be meant for academic purposes.  In late 2014, after many Charlesview residents relocated to a new building a half-mile down Western Avenue, Harvard began remediation and demolition of the old complex. Construction on the site is projected to continue into 2016.
Continuum 
Once known as “Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons,” Continuum—so-termed by developer Samuels and Associates—is a residential and retail complex located at the corner of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue. The project includes housing units, retail space, and parking slots. Harvard and city officials broke ground on Continuum in late 2013, and tenants began moving into the completed building this past fall. On Jan. 25, 42 applicants were chosen by lottery to rent affordable housing units in the complex.
The New SEAS 
In November 2015 Harvard filed an IMP Notification Form updating its plans for the the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex after holding four community meetings on the topic. Two-thirds of the SEAS faculty is slated to move across the Charles in 2020. The University is currently responding to comments made by the BRA and the general public regarding the proposal. Harvard first presented plans for the $1 billion health and life science center in Allston in December 2012. Shortly thereafter, University President Drew G. Faust announced the complex would include parts of SEAS, though the details, date, and scope of the school’s move remain uncertain.
Hotel and Conference Center
The IMP proposes that Harvard build a hotel and conference center on Western Ave. with meeting spaces and approximately 200 bedrooms. Although the University has not officially determined whether the hotel will be managed by Harvard or a third-party operator, the project is predicted to go forward between 2020 and 2024.
Basketball Venue and Mixed-Use Facility 
Harvard administrators have planned a new mixed-use facility and basketball venue on the North Harvard Street site of the old Ed Portal, slated for construction between 2020 and 2024. The arena would be a 1,000-seat upgrade from the 2,195-seat Lavietes Pavilion, the second-smallest basketball arena in the Ivy League. The facility will also feature graduate housing and ground-floor retail space, according to the IMP. When the venue was initially included in the IMP, Allston residents expressed concerns about the noise and activity that the larger arena might bring.
Harvard Stadium 
The University will undertake a renovation of and addition to the Harvard Stadium over the next two years. Harvard plans to repair areas of deterioration, increase accessibility for those with disabilities, and expand and upgrade the stadium’s restroom and concession facilities. Additionally, the University will construct new locker room spaces for the football program, new press areas, indoor seating, and office space for the Athletics department while decreasing the total number of stadium seats by roughly 8,000 from 30,262. The project is slated for completion by 2018.
Harvard Life Lab 
Officially named on Wednesday, the Harvard Life Lab is slated to open in September 2016, pending BRA approval. At two stories and 15,000 square feet, the modular biotech building on Western Avenue will house biological labs and team planning space dedicated to supporting student research and enterprise in biotechnology. The Life Lab will be built on a portion of the Innovation Lab’s parking lot, joining the i-lab and Launch Lab on Harvard’s rapidly expanding enterprise campus. Harvard plans to operate the Life Lab for five to ten years as a prototype until it relocates to a more permanent facility in Allston.
Smith Field Playground
Though details are scant at this time, Boston’s Parks and Recreation department began to draft a master plan for Smith Field playground in early 2015, which is expected to be completed in the next few months, according to a statement from project manager Cathy Baker-Eclipse provided by Parks and Recreation spokesperson Ryan Woods. Baker-Eclipse wrote the playground master plan includes features to “make the park a park for the entire neighborhood.”
Klarman Hall and G2 Pavilion
Harvard plans to construct two new academic buildings, Klarman Hall and the G2 Pavilion, on a site currently home to the Business School’s Burden Hall and an adjacent parking lot. Construction will take place in two phases and will add approximately 76,100 square feet of new space. The first phase will involve the creation of Klarman Hall, a two-story facility planned to hold a media-equipped auditorium seating roughly 1,000 in addition to foyer, reception, meeting, and service space. The second phase will consist of the demolition of Burden Hall and the construction of G2 Pavilion, a two-story building with classroom and meeting space.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of political activists and enthusiasts from both ends of the political spectrum flooded into the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics on Monday to watch as the Iowa caucuses unfolded, marking the official start to the 2016 presidential election.
Members of the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and Harvard United For Bernie all camped out in the forum to watch the beginning of the nomination process while munching on chips, goldfish, and chocolate-drizzled popcorn.
IOP director Carrie S. Devine estimated a turnout of 400 to 450 people, largely made up of students from the College and the Kennedy School of Government.
The Harvard College Democrats watched a close race play out between former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and United States Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa. The Sanders fans watched nervously as the vote was split evenly throughout the night.
“It’s great. It’s exciting that we all get to be here and see it on the big screen,” said Susan X. Wang ’17, president of the Harvard College Democrats.
A low point in the night for some Democrats came when Martin J. O’Malley, former governor of Maryland, decided to suspend his campaign after a poor showing in the caucuses. Nick J. Abbott ’18, who formerly worked for O’Malley, said he was especially distraught.
“It’s an exciting time. I wish things had gone better for Martin O’Malley, but it is an entertainment spectacle at this point,” Abbott said. “Huge frowny-face emoji.”
The Harvard Republican Club paid close attention to the three-man race between leading GOP contenders businessman Donald J. Trump, U.S. Senator Marco A. Rubio, and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. While Cruz, a Harvard Law School graduate, ended up winning the caucuses according to the Associated Press, Rubio had an unexpectedly strong showing, signifying he will likely be a factor for the rest of the Republican race. Trump, despite his big talk, placed second.
Aaron I. Henricks ’16, member and former president of the Harvard Republican Club, said he thought Cruz would win.
“I’m happy he beat Donald Trump,” Henricks said. “I’m happy we can say proudly and loudly that Donald Trump is a huge loser. Huge loser.”
Gwen R. Thomas ’17, president of the Harvard Republican Club, was “excited to see two tight races.”
“Since we’re watching it live, I feel like we’re watching a sports game,” she said. “It’s a great atmosphere.”
John S. Acton ’17, a member of the Harvard Republican Club, said he was looking forward to “having actual results” and was excited about “getting to the point where there are fewer candidates,” saying “it will be better for the Party and the country overall.”
Unfortunately for those interested in the Democratic race, the forum closed before the final results were tallied. At press time, the Democratic caucuses remained too close to call.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON–In recent years, a trip to the Beanpot final has been ever so elusive for the No. 7/7 Harvard men’s hockey team.
This February proved no different.
Two power play goals in the second period on as many chances for No. 4/4 Boston College turned a one-goal deficit into a one-goal lead, as the Eagles eventually walked away victors, 3-2. The BC win sent the Crimson home early for the eighth consecutive year and the 11th time in Harvard coach Ted Donato’s 12-year stint in Cambridge.
“We’re disappointed,” Donato said. “We’re obviously frustrated that we didn’t execute a lot of things that we needed to do to be more successful.”
With the Crimson (12-5-3, 8-3-3 ECAC) up 2-1 five minutes into the second frame, a tripping penalty by sophomore Jake Horton gave the Eagles (18-4-4, 10-1-4 Hockey East) their first man advantage of the contest. BC sophomore forward Zach Sanford was able to jam a puck past sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen’s left pad to equalize the contest at two.
The go-ahead goal came less than five minutes later. Eagles freshman Colin White got the puck to Madsen’s left, just above the goal line and deked out freshman defenseman Adam Baughman with a shot fake before sending a shot off Madsen’s pads and into the back of the net. BC was able to take advantage of a Clay Anderson interference call, scoring 1:38 into the man advantage and evoking roars from the Eagles’ student section.
Harvard’s best chance to equalize came with just under seven minutes to play, when junior forward Austin Cangelosi was sent to the box for slashing. But the ECAC’s most potent power play was unable to capitalize, as Boston College killed the crucial penalty.
“We knew we were in a good spot,” co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “We just had to play a good third period, and we came up a little bit short.”
After a slow start, the Crimson looked to have taken control of the contest late in the first period. With the semifinal tied at one goal apiece, Baughman found himself alone at the point after the freshman, playing in just his second collegiate game, received a no-look pass from junior forward Alexander Kerfoot. The rookie waited a second and picked his spot, just as Criscuolo skated in front of junior goaltender Thatcher Demko, sent a wrister five-hole that wobbled into the net for his first collegiate goal and point.
“It’s never easy when you are a new guy and don’t get a chance to play because of your health” Donato said. “It was just [Baughman’s] second game tonight, but it was nice to see him step up and score an important goal for us.”
The go-ahead tally wasn’t without some controversy, as the offensive possession started with co-captain Jimmy Vesey getting tripped up and crashing into Demko. After review, the refs ruled that the senior didn’t touch the puck in the crease on the Baughman shot, resulting in the call standing. Vesey recorded the second assist on the goal, bumping his point streak to 10 games.
Harvard took back momentum in the latter half of the first period after the Eagles had come storming through the gates. After three great chances for BC missed, forward Ryan Fitzgerald found himself on the boards behind the goal. The junior threw a no-look, between-the-legs pass back in front of the net to the point, where his brother Casey corralled the puck and sent a slapshot towards net, beating Madsen pad-side.
The Crimson failed to put a shot on net for the first 9:47 of the game, but capitalized when a blocked shot by junior Tyler Moy in the defensive zone sent the puck sliding towards the Eagles’ net. Freshman Ryan Donato won the race to the puck against two BC defensemen and took only a second to handle the puck before firing a wrister that beat Demko through the legs to tie the game at one.
“I didn’t really get a good chance to see the first [goal],” Boston College coach Jerry York said. “But I thought [Demko] looked solid in net for the second minutes.”
Despite allowing three goals, Madsen kept Harvard in the game, recording key saves to keep the deficit at only one for the second half of the game. With 5:20 left in the second period, Eagles’ junior forward Adam Gilmour had space in the slot, but a pad save from Madsen kept the Crimson within striking distance. The California native recorded 30 saves in the losing effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Queens of Boston. That is the title that four crosstown rival schools will be vying for in this month’s Beanpot Tournament. The 2016 rendition of the annual face-off between Harvard, Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern is set to face off today at 5 p.m. at the Walter Brown Arena on BU’s campus.
The Crimson (12-8-1, 9-6-1 ECAC) has its first round matchup against the Eagles (27-0, 19-0 Hockey East), a team currently sitting atop the national rankings. The two teams have history coming into the game, with Harvard having beat BC in last year’s Beanpot to take home the championship trophy for the 14th time in program history.
“The Beanpot is huge,” senior forward Miye D’Oench said. “BC is a big rival and obviously we want to come away with the win. We won it last year and it’s an incredible tournament. There’s so much history and it’s so fun. “
The stage for the 2014-2015 faceoff strikes similarity to this season’s matchup in the fact that the Eagles enter the games ranked first in the country with an undefeated record. Last year, the Crimson was able to edge BC, 3-2, taking the trophy on home ice.
This year, however, the road to the Beanpot has been different for Harvard, entering the game ranked tenth in the nation as opposed to the No. 4 ranking it earned last year at this time.
The Crimson has also seen some difficult losses leading up to tonight’s matchup, narrowly maintaining a .500 record since returning to the ice after the break. Harvard has not been able to come up with a win against a team ranked in the top five since mid-November, making this face-off against the Eagles even more important in establishing the team’s presence in the field going toward the playoffs.
“They’re all big,” said Harvard head coach Katey Stone after Saturday’s victory against Princeton. “Every game is the biggest game of our season and that’s how we approach it. We know that we’re in a situation where we need to scratch and claw our way up the ladder.”
The win against the Tigers on Saturday night brought much-needed momentum to the team after struggling down the stretch in January. The Crimson’s offense came alive early in the game and stayed consistent throughout, ending with four goals after 60 minutes of play.
Minimizing turnovers and killing power plays were key in the team’s most recent win and will continue to be a strong indicator of success. Against Princeton, Harvard was able to kill all four of its opponent’s power play opportunities, including a six-on-four situation at the end of the third period.
The ability to score early in the contest can set the tone in the game, as the Crimson is 9-3 in match-ups in which the team scores in the opening period.
“There’s a lot of things we have to work on [going into Tuesday’s game],” Stone said. “It’s taking care of the puck, personal responsibility and accountability… getting pucks to the net and still playing great defense.”
This is the second time this season that Harvard will match up against BC. The two teams faced off on Jan. 19 in a game that saw the Eagles come away with the 2-0 shutout victory.
Tonight’s contest will have many similar elements to the previous, including the match-up of two of the top goalies in the nation. Crimson netminder Emerance Maschmeyer enters the game with 486 saves on the season through 16 games, while BC goalie Katie Burt is 20-0 with 439. Currently Maschmeyer sits .001 percentage points ahead of Burt in save percentage, while Burt come into the game with less goals allowed in her ice time, 23, to Maschmeyer’s 25.
With the final stretch of the season ahead for both teams, the Beanpot has the ability to set the tone for what is to come in the closing weeks.
“It’s getting to be February and every single win is going to be huge in the end,” D’Oench said. “The trick is taking it one game at a time and focusing on the next opponent and right now it’s BC so that is who we are focusing on now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—The Beanpot, one of the greatest annual traditions in all of college sports, has provided the Hub of Hockey with more than its fair share of history. Yet 63 installments in, Boston’s biggest battle for bragging rights continues to see firsts.
This year, for the first time in Beanpot history, three of the tournament’s four participants entered the first Monday of February ranked among the top 10 teams in the country.
Perhaps even more surprisingly, Cambridge’s lone Beanpot representative was not the side bringing up the rear. In fact, Harvard—which has failed to reach the championship game every year since 2008—entered this year’s tournament with the highest position in the PairWise (fifth) of all four teams.
Right on the Crimson’s tail, however, was Boston College—a program that has brought 19 Beanpot titles back to Chestnut Hill, including five straight from 2010 to 2014 with coach Jerry York at the helm.
And now the Eagles are after another one.
Propelled by two unanswered power-play goals midway through the second period on Monday, No. 4/4 BC (18-4-4, 10-1-4 Hockey East) marched onto next week’s championship game against Boston University, knocking off the No. 7/7 Crimson (12-5-3, 8-3-3 ECAC) by a score of 3-2. Harvard has now come up short against the Eagles 12 straight times in the Beanpot, a drought that dates back to 1998.
“The group is frustrated because I don’t think we played as well as we know we can play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “There’s obviously a lot to play for the rest of the way…but at this moment, it doesn’t mean this is any less frustrating.”
NO MAN ADVANTAGE
This year’s edition of the Crimson is built on speed. In fact, Harvard’s high-flying attack entered Monday averaging nearly four goals per contest. But where this speed benefits Coach Donato’s squad most is on the power play, where the Crimson has been scoring at an incredible pace.
With a number of shifty forwards at its disposal, Harvard’s power play closed out the month of January ranked second in the country with a 32 percent conversion rate. But on Monday night, York and company gave the unit little to work with.
Despite having surrendered more penalty minutes per game than any team in the nation, the Eagles put the Crimson on the man-up just twice and came away unscathed both times—once late in the first period and again with 6:59 remaining in the third.
The latter infraction—a slash called against junior center Austin Cangelosi—offered Harvard, down a goal, a chance to equalize with the clock winding down.
But two minutes later, the Crimson remained stuck on the comeback trail. BC not only killed the penalty—it prevented Harvard from generating a single shot on target.
“We wanted to limit their number of chances, [and] I think we did that,” said York, who just last month became the first hockey coach in Division I history to accumulate 1000 career wins.
“There were only two power plays all night for both teams,” he said. “I didn’t want to get into a special teams game…. I think we did a good job blocking lanes and just being really determined on that penalty kill.”
WE TOO CAN PLAY THAT GAME
The successful penalty kill set the tone for the final stretch, as the Eagles held the Crimson to just one shot for the rest of the game—a turn-around backhander from co-captain Jimmy Vesey with three minutes remaining that was hardly a threat.
But BC won the special teams battle in more than just its own end. In fact, the Eagles beat Harvard at its own game.
Despite entering the game ranked 19th in the country on the power play—17 spots below the Crimson, BC capitalized on two Harvard penalties in the second period to claim the lead for good.
A tripping call against sophomore forward Jake Horton five minutes into the frame gave the Eagles their first man-up chance of the night. And one minute into the ensuing power play, sophomore center Zach Sanford forced a puck under goaltender Merrick Madsen’s left pad from atop the goalmouth to tie the game at two.
Whistled for interference after bumping into a BC skater away from the puck, Clay Anderson gave the Eagles another chance to strike just three minutes later.
And strike, they did. After BC’s power play turned into an effective five-on-three thanks to a broken Alexander Kerfoot stick near the blue line, freshman center Colin White danced past rookie defenseman Adam Baughman and blasted a shot off the glove of Madsen and in from point-blank range.
The goal came with about 30 minutes of hockey still remaining, but junior goaltender Thatcher Demko would not need any further offensive support. After Harvard scored on its first two shots on goal—a Donato breakaway and a Baughman blast—the junior made 21 consecutive saves to return BC to its historically rightful place in the Beanpot championship.
As for Harvard, the wait rolls on.

Clover lovers, rejoice, because the beloved overwhelming smell of chickpea fritters that overcomes you as soon as you turn the corner to Holyoke Street will now be moving to Mass Ave. That’s right, the (terrifyingly) uncertain fate of Clover HSQ has been secured–its new home will be where Yenching (#rip) used to be. In honor of this move, here are some pros and cons of Clover’s new home.
Pro: Clover’s new location on Mass Ave makes it that much more tempting to stop by for lunch or a snack after classes in the Yard (technically, this is a con for your wallet, but a pro for your stomach). Don’t deny it—even though the move may not be that far, in the dead of Cambridge winter, we would all do anything to take one less step in the brutally cold weather.
Con: Clover’s new location on Mass Ave will lure even more unknowing tourists dropped off on this busy street after their tour of the campus. Be prepared to have a bunch of pictures of you eating taken by people who mistook its “food lab” aesthetic for an actual Harvard science lab.
Pro: Members of the Porcellian now basically have an experimental vegetarian kitchen on their premises.
Con: Members of Apley will lament at the all too real feeling of having another semi-close eatery taken further away from them.
Pro: We no longer have to stare ahead into the creepily empty space that once used to be Sandrine’s, that restaurant that only existed when our parents were in town.
Con: We now have the view into the rooms of Wigg. This means you get to watch eager and bright-eyed freshmen go to class (they probably even got up early to do their Ec10 readings), while you take your sweet time enjoying a Clover iced coffee and being late to section.

As an adopted Bostonian, University President Drew G. Faust is, of course, a diehard Pats fan. And like her fellow New Englanders, she seems to still be recovering from last week’s heartbreaking loss to Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos. Brutal. Us too, President Faust. (Just kidding—we don’t care about sports unless it’s Harvard-Yale).
So with the Super Bowl approaching, Flyby went knocking on Mass Hall to ask some hard-hitting questions. But most importantly: who was she going to root for on Sunday?
“The Patriots,” she said, forlorn.
While Superbowl L (why does the NFL think it’s important enough for Roman numerals?) might not be her ideal matchup, Faust joked that she knew the Patriots were not, in fact, playing on Sunday. Flyby was grateful for this clarification—aren’t the Patriots in the Super Bowl every year? What is a “deflategate”? Isn't Tom Brady, like, mayor?
Faust did give her two cents on the game—come Sunday, she says she’ll be looking out for the Panthers.
“I’m actually curious because I haven’t watched the Panthers play and they’re supposed to be really good, and so I’m curious how good they’re going to be. We’ll see,” Faust said.
