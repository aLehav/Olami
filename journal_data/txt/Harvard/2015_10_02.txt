After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his second memoir, “Gamelife,” Michael Clune has given himself quite a task: to examine how computer games, popularly synonymous with hours wasted vegetating in front of a screen, profoundly shaped his identity. Clune, who spent his younger years in the suburban Illinois of the 1980s, grew up playing games like “Pirates!” and “The Bard’s Tale II.” Now an English professor at Case Western Reserve University, he argues for the spiritual depth of those games and seeks to challenge the “superstitious fear that computer games were sucking my life dry instead of nourishing it.” Through the lens of seven salient games, Clune describes exciting, confusing, and harrowing episodes of his childhood. Ostensibly, the book focuses on the games; ultimately, however, the games serve as the framework with which he explores his childhood, not the other way around. The result is an unexpectedly aching exploration of growing up.
Each chapter of “Gamelife” follows roughly the same structure, to varying effectiveness. First, Clune gives some context: his age, his social and familial situation, and the particular dystopian element of the ’80s that struck him then, among other orienting details. Next, he introduces a game and recounts his experience with it. Surprisingly, these descriptions are so enticing that they draw comparison with his considerably different earlier memoir, “White Out: The Secret Life of Heroin,” a critically acclaimed account of addiction and the “heroin underground.” Through his writing, Clune makes it clear why these games, so simple by modern standards, were so captivating; most of the truly page-turning parts of “Gamelife” are indeed his game descriptions. He then dives into the metaphorical significance of each game, ranging from the benefits of two-dimensionality to the implications of the pirate economy on 21st-century capitalism. These analyses, however, do not particularly impress. “Gamelife” may be at its strongest describing the allure of the games, but it is often at its weakest conveying their philosophical import. Sometimes, in doing so Clune does intrigue: He convincingly argues that World War II shooter games like “Castle Wolfenstein” and, later, “Call of Duty” succeed because they capture the mystique and power of history like no book can. But, for example, when he makes the procrustean comparison between hit points in “The Bard’s Tale II” and real-life emotion, he simply bewilders.
Tellingly, as Clune ages and the events of his life become more interesting, his game analysis plays a less central role in the book. What remains is his story, driven by the universal adolescent struggle to define and accept oneself. It is here that “Gamelife” truly begins to shine. Whereas “White Out” illustrated the exotic, “Gamelife” seeks common ground. Its characters aren’t always three-dimensional—but they are immediately recognizable. The pretentious ten-year-olds, the status-obsessed middle-schoolers, the paranoid parents—“Gamelife” is populated by all the people who make childhood uncomfortable.
Fortunately, Clune avoids the all-too-common pitfall of authors who write about children: giving their young characters a patronizingly simplistic voice that hamstrings any attempt to convey the incredibly complex thoughts and emotions with which children respond to their world. Instead, in “Gamelife” even 11-year-old Michael is as witty, skeptical, and existential as he is charmingly naïve and identifiably unsure of himself. When a teammate criticizes him at 6th-grade basketball practice for his lack of hustle, he waxes philosophical: “I tried to try. Not everyone has the ability to try.” Through games, interactions, and often-hilarious internal monologue, Clune gives his younger self a real, capable voice—a major aspect of the book which saves it from Clune’s less appealing impersonal points.
As much as Clune deviates from the traditional, under-appreciative understanding of computer games, he diverges from the typical, over-romanticized portrayal of childhood. Like most, Michael has a boyhood altogether defined not by carefree afternoons but by uncertainty and unreality. By the time they reach middle school, Michael and his friends are frantically bluffing and bullying to establish their savvy and masculinity. The adults are not much better; his Catholic-school teachers are cruel, his friends’ parents are overly familiar, and everyone is possessed by Reagan-era consumerism, fads, and hawkishness. Clune’s best game analysis uses the interstellar-travel game “Elite” as a digital Seurat: The closer he looks at the three-dimensional space station, the more it breaks down before his eyes. So, too, does the society around him.
At one point, Michael’s mother warns that if he doesn’t reconnect with his friends, who have entirely and inexplicably stopped talking to him, he “could very well never have friends again!” She goes on, “The meaning of your life is in the quality of your human relationships, Michael. My therapist says it, it says it in the Bible, everyone knows it, Michael!” At its core, this is what “Gamelife” is about: It denounces not just the idea that computer games are a waste of time but also the conception that the meaning of life is defined solely in terms of other people. His criticism of the latter belief resonates far more his presentation of than of the former.
“Gamelife” closes with a winning reflection on those “wasted” hours. Surrounded by all the unreality of “real life,” all the cruelty and hollowness of other people, Clune concludes that computer games offered him a way to explore other worlds, fantastic characters, and, through them, his identity. Years later, he has returned the favor with a powerful defense of games—and of solitude.

I didn’t think I could love Brandon Stanton’s Humans of New York any more than I did when he chronicled the students of the Mott Hall Bridges Academy and their incredible principal, Ms. Lopez. Or when he shared the stories of Iraq’s Yazidi minorities escaping the wrath of ISIS. Or when he gave us a non-mainstream peek into the lives of average Pakistani and Iranian citizens. But HONY’s recent series on refugees making their way across Europe is his most timely and needed one yet.
This series is important not only because the refugee crisis has reached a desperate point in terms of its magnitude and Europe’s poor handling of the migration, but also because this is a time when people have become impervious to mass tragedies.
One study shows that “people relate to the suffering of one as a tragedy but tune out the loss of thousands as a statistic.” There is a tendency for people to turn away from mass suffering, but feel compassion when they hear a single tragic story. It is easy while having our morning coffee to continue scrolling on our phones when coming across a headline that reads “Hundreds of Casualties in Air Raids on Syrian Market.” But when we hit a HONY post of a Syrian woman in tears lamenting that her husband was never found in the ocean, it is not so easy to go about our day without her words echoing in our mind.
At a time when millions of people—millions of individual stories and tragedies—have been expelled from their homes, displaced, or even killed, the political and social climate has not given these humans the dignity they deserve. Political discourse points to them as a problem or source of potential economic downfall rather than living humans who are desperate to escape conditions we couldn’t imagine surviving.
It is easy on our psyches to point fingers at the rich Gulf States, such as Saudi Arabia or Qatar or the United Arab Emirates—states that have shamefully not taken in a single Syrian refugee—in an attempt to paint the whole Arab world as heartless. Reflect on the fact that the Arab world is often seen as barbaric while the Western world is seen as humane, then consider that Lebanon currently houses 1.2 million refugees, Jordan has 650,000, and Iraq has almost 250,000, all of which are spreading their very thin resources to accept more refugees and have significantly fewer resources than many European nations. And while countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar should absolutely be accepting Iraqi and Syrian refugees, this argument distracts from the gravest tragedy of this whole conversation: the refugees themselves.
It is demoralizing to see refugee families survive their war-torn countries and risk their lives crossing oceans on plastic boats only to be met with such degrading obstacles once inside the European countries. It is disheartening that innocent victims can be demonized to such an extent. To say we have failed them is an understatement.
The political debate of whether Western nations should feel responsible to take in refugees is built on a false premise: many have painted these refugees as mass troublemakers, terrorists, and threats to Western culture, rather than individuals who deserve a life outside of violent war. This is why the power of a single story is so strong. It is easy to point to the influx of refugees as freeloaders, but it is hard to do so when reading about Muhammad, a Syrian man who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week to save up enough money to make it to Europe, and then spent 17 hours a day learning German in order to integrate into life in Austria.
It’s almost impossible to read his story and be inclined to believe that he won’t be a productive member of society. The people that make an appearance on the HONY page want what almost every other one of the millions of refugee want: a chance to make an honest living, contribute to society, and provide for their families.
The power of HONY lies in its ability to shake us of all of our “compassion fatigue.” Compare reading a headline that states, “Europe Faces Unprecedented Migrant Crisis, Warns OECD” to reading the individual stories of the refugees coming in. One elicits fear, the other compassion. We need not see traumatic pictures of dead bodies to shudder out of our comfort—it just takes a single story attached to a face. Just as HONY’s portraits have mobilized people before, my only wish is that enough coverage will result in some sort of widespread action.
Mother Teresa once said, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will.” I can only hope that the leaders of our world stumble upon a HONY portrait. Maybe then, they too will act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, gun violence returned to the agenda in city halls around the country. In Boston, shootings increased during the first quarter of 2015, and spiked enough during the summer to spark an official re-launching of the city’s gun buyback program. In Chicago, gun violence continues to outpace last year’s levels, with 400 more shootings as of Tuesday.
The usual culprits are present: the laxity of federal, state and local gun laws and the need for more enforcement of existing laws. In the case of Boston, a recent policy brief from the Harvard Kennedy School’s Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston gives some idea of the scope of the problem. According to the report, of 3,202 handguns recovered by the Boston Police between 2007 and 2013, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was able to trace 1,813. Of those, almost a quarter came from five southern states along I-95 with weaker gun laws than the Commonwealth’s—yet another clear signal of the need for federal action. In addition, about 18 percent of the traced guns came from New Hampshire and Maine, also states with weaker gun laws, and 22.3 percent came from states other than those. Gun violence, the statistics make clear, is a national problem that demands a national solution.
Other elements of the report, however, point to a key area in which Massachusetts could do better. About a third of the traced firearms were purchased in the Commonwealth. Of those almost 84 percent were not recovered from the first purchaser, and of that subset, fully 62.8 percent did not have any records of the secondary transactions that followed their first sale. This failure is one of enforcement. Though Massachusetts has tough secondary sale laws, the Commonwealth has not devised an adequate strategy for implementing them.
While better enforcement will undoubtedly alleviate some issues, however, one lesson of past Massachusetts gun control efforts is that states trying to avoid gun crime may need more comprehensive and aggressive strategies to deal with the problem of secondary sales and to stem the flow of out of state weapons. A Massachusetts law passed in 1998, for example, has had its effectiveness blunted by out-of-state guns.
Massachusetts Democratic primary voters punted on one opportunity for a new approach when they did not nominate former State Senator Warren Tolman as the party’s candidate for Attorney General last year. Tolman, on whose campaign I worked, had a serious plan to use the powers of the Attorney General’s office to mandate the use of smart gun technology in new guns sold in the Commonwealth, the kind of serious step that might finally give law enforcement a leg up against gun violence. Similarly promising proposals have not been forthcoming.
Though better gun regulation may reduce urban violence, however, it cannot address the long-running historical trends of which the current spate of shootings, largely in communities of color, is a symptom.
In Chicago, the flow of guns illustrates part of the connection between unaddressed disparities and the violence that plagues cities. A Chicago Police Department study of guns used in crimes between 2001 and 2012 found, as expected, that neighboring Illinois municipalities and Indiana accounted for a large proportion of recovered guns. The state from which the third-highest number of guns originated, however, was Mississippi, especially the Delta counties of the West. As a New York Times report on the Chicago Police study points out, “during the migration of [African-American] families from the South in the 1940s and 1970s, Chicago was a top destination…”
The prevalence of these historic ties is of more than just academic interest; it also points to the key role that dislocating historical processes have played in creating the conditions for today’s urban violence. An Economist article on the vast racial disparities in the United States put the issue thusly:
“Most of the black Americans who are now struggling are the left-behinds of two great internal migrations. The first, from south to north in the early 20th century, left behind people in the Mississippi Delta, which is now the poorest bit of the country. More recently a second migration has been going on, from northern cities to southern ones…this smaller exodus has left people behind in highly segregated bits of northern cities…”
In short, the poorest parts of the South are one source for the guns used in the violent crimes rocking some of the poorest parts of the North. And public policy has yet to redress the legacies of racial discrimination and violence that produced these current inequities and fuel violence.
Indeed, to “highly segregated” the author might have added the “highly policed.” A last link in the chain connecting contemporary urban gun violence with America’s racial past is the War on Drugs and the phenomenon of mass incarceration that accompanied it, both of which have taken men out of communities and helped stoke violent conditions in inner-city neighborhoods.
As the colder months give cities a slight respite from gun violence, policymakers have much to ponder. Effective gun control will require new strategies around the country. But more fundamentally, America needs integrated economic, legal, and social solutions to the deep-seated racial disparities that are at the root of urban violence around the country.

“Hey! How’s it been?”
“Hey! It’s been good! How are you?”
“Good! Work is picking up, but you know, probably the same for everybody right now.”
“Yeah, totally. I guess job stuff is a little bit crazy right now too.”
“Are you recruiting?”
“Yeah. Yeah, I am.”
“Oh, nice! Hey, good for you for getting on the employment game so early.”
[Some silence.]
“I’m guessing you’re not recruiting, then?”
“Yep, yep. You know, fellowships and what not. Apparently public service recruiting’s in October?”
“Haha, I guess you haven’t come over to the dark side yet, have you? Good for you, too.”
“Haha, yeah I guess. Okie dokes, I’m heading off to Boylston. See ya later, and good luck with your interviews!”
“Yeah, so good to see you!”
This article isn’t about the pros and cons of recruiting. Heck, it’s not even about the systematic problems that often make public service options too little, too late for seniors. I do need an outlet, though, to vent about some awkward conversations I’ve had lately with people who are recruiting, good friends and acquaintances alike. Likely, those folks probably want an outlet to vent about talking to a person who is not recruiting (or maybe about the experience of talking to me in general). So bear with me.
When a person who is recruiting and a person who is not recruiting begin a conversation about jobs, an elephant is born into the room. Both of you can sense the invisible young elephant dashing around like mad, and it really stresses you out like hell. So you eventually blow off the subject (“Gah, I know, so stressful”) and change the topic of conversation.
I have recently had the chance to meet said elephant. And now, I write to proliferate her message to my beloved peers.
There was a time I almost went to a recruiting event. It wasn’t consulting and it wasn’t finance, but it seemed vaguely within my field of interest. “Why not?” The only cost would be wearing my pencil skirt for an hour, and the food and chitchat would maybe make up for it. The return on investment on that pencil skirt has been low anyway, and this could be the chance.
But maybe God wanted me to write this column, so I bumped into two good friends while grabbing a quick dinner in advance of the event. When I mentioned my plans for the rest of the day, the elephant unfailingly appeared. But unlike me in the countless conversations I’d had from the flip side, my two friends were not afraid to call the elephant and give her a seat at the table.
The questions came, not too fast like the speed of bullets, but just intentionally timed enough to make for a thoughtful conversation. What does this company do? They took a look at the website. What does this description of “Our Work” really mean? What is the work that you’d be doing for them? Jenny, what is it that you want to do after school? Not to get touchy-feely, but what is your ideal role in society? Does their work match that role both in substance and spirit? Are there other reasons that you are considering this job that overpower any hesitation?
I ended up not attending the networking event that night.
In retrospect, it couldn’t have mattered less if I had gone to the recruiting event, applied, interviewed, gotten the job, and taken it. What mattered is that my two friends helped me face the elephant in the room, whether that elephant eventually confirmed my interest in the company or led me to realize that it wasn’t for me.
This applies to both sides of the coin. More than once this month, I have nervously sat across my computer with 12 Crimson Careers tabs open at 11:53 p.m. on the night of a major recruiting deadline. Was I making the right choice by not recruiting? Was I missing out?
Do a service to the person who is not recruiting by acknowledging the elephant: Why are you not recruiting? What do these companies do? Have you looked closely? What would be the work that you do? Does any of it fall in line with the vision you have for yourself?
Throughout the next year, the OCS emails will continue to arrive, and they will continue to drive us crazy, whether through fear of missing out or through constant self-consciousness about “selling out.” As classmates and peers, the least we can do is to step beyond the judgments in our minds—“ugh, here goes the annoying public service evangelist” or “ugh, I guess you sold your soul”—and help each other make intentional choices throughout the process.
So, let’s make the best of those awkward conversations. Without them, we wouldn’t have elephants to meet. The next time we chat, offer me your hand as we greet the elephant together; I will offer mine.

The long dreaded news is finally here—Al’s, Clover and other business have been asked to leave the Smith Campus Center. Expressions of grief and sorrow followed in social media. We would like to bid a forlorn farewell to Clover and expectantly look forward to a rosy future of the Smith Center.
We have applauded the plans to transform the Smith Center into a student hub, and we have praised the administration for soliciting input from students in its creation, while also urging more and broader consultations. Overall, the planned renovations point to a hopeful future for the Smith Center. Still, it is difficult to say goodbye to Clover, which has become a beloved piece of student life where many us have shared fond memories.
Clover—home for Harvard’s vegetarians, tofu embracers, and fake bacon connoisseurs alike—has long been a student favorite. Together with other Harvard square eateries, it provided the sort of social buzz that can be hard to find consistently on campus. It will be dearly missed.
But however tragic Clover’s departure may be, the need for more social space on campus is a real one. We have voiced our desire for more social spaces several times in the recent past, and we have also praised the administration’s revived interest in creating more inclusive spaces. Despite these ongoing efforts to reform the social atmosphere, however, the need for a central campus hub is clear, and the transformation of the cement monstrosity into a vibrant student space is a change we welcome.
In a sense, the loss of Clover can be seen as a sacrifice. As those of us who have learned from Greg Mankiw that everything is a tradeoff might know, in order to achieve a better future, certain comforts and delights of the present have to be let go.
With Clover and other Harvard Square institutions on the way out of the Smith Center, the administration must bring renewed focus to what will replace them. Administrators have been commendable in soliciting student feedback in the planning of the new center, and that effort must not expand as construction begins. It will be an utter misfortune if the prospective campus center doesn’t reflect student’s voices and fails to fulfill their desire for an inclusive and central social hub.
Another key element of this inclusive vision is the provision of more space for student organizations that currently lack it. Ensuring that a wide array of student organizations, including some currently relegated to basement spaces, are on a more equal footing with their peers is a concrete way to make inclusion a reality in the new Smith Center.
The loss of Clover will be deeply felt. Yet we hope that this loss proves a small price to pay for a more vibrant student life.

After more than 10 months of planning, HUBweek will kick off this Saturday with the first in a series of lectures, art installations, panels, and forums that will comprise the week-long celebration of Boston area innovation and arts.
The festival's inaugural iteration, which Harvard, MIT, the Boston Globe, and Massachusetts General Hospital are co-hosting, is slated to include more than 50 events at a variety of locations across Boston and Cambridge, including several on Harvard’s campus.
Events range from light shows to forums on food consumption, and from public health hackathons to experiential learning demonstrations, all aimed at showcasing the work of local institutions. Most events are free to the public, though some require advanced registration.
“People will see something they might otherwise have never seen, people will leave with a better understanding of all of the amazing things that are happening at universities and hospitals every day,” said Peggy Newell, Harvard’s deputy provost and a member of the festival’s executive committee. “People will leave feeling like Massachusetts is still the hub of discovery and innovation.”
Newell said that organizers hope the events will reinvigorate Boston’s image as an intellectual center and encourage students and business owners to put down economic roots in the Boston area. One of the initial inspirations for the festival, said Newell, was “to celebrate and reclaim Boston’s long history of leadership in discovery and innovation.”
Events are organized into “hub” and “spoke” categories—”hub” events involve collaborations between the four institutions behind the festival, while “spoke” events are hosted by one of the four. Harvard faculty members including Michael J. Sandel and Robert A. Lue will participate in theses events, which include some hosted by the Harvard Art Museums, the School of Public health, the Harvard Ed Portal, and more entities across the University.
“We have people working across many disciplines, and we have a level of excellence across those disciplines that is really quite extraordinary,” Newell said. “There are times when it’s easy to go around campus in these circles that you would normally travel in without seeing some of the great things around you.”
Lue, who will be part of a Harvard “spoke” event on Monday, said that Harvard’s involvement will ideally introduce the public to visions of “the future of learning” as embodied by institutions of higher education, a future which he believes hinges on collaborations between science and the humanities.
“It’s sort of a direction that we don’t expose to the public as often as we should,” Lue said. “We talk about STEM education as a separate thing, we talk about arts and humanities education as a separate thing, and really there’s a lot that can be achieved by bringing the two together.”
Lue’s sold-out event, “Art. Science. Learning.” demonstrates interconnections between the sciences and humanities through a showcase of strategies that Lue said are often used in Harvard classrooms.
These intersections, said Lue, are at the heart of HUBweek’s mission. “It’s a reaffirmation in my mind of the power of liberal arts,” he said.
HUBweek, which rose out of inspiration from collaborative festivals like South by Southwest, is also aimed at affirming Harvard’s role as a “citizen” within the Boston community with a responsibility to the “dissemination of knowledge,” said Newell. Depending on the success of the events, organizers will assess the future of HUBweek and the possibility of future festivals.

With the addition of Princeton to its list of partners, edX, the non-profit MOOC provider that Harvard and MIT founded in 2012, now has more Ivy League partners than its largest for-profit competitor, Coursera.
Princeton’s decision, announced on Sept. 24, comes just three months after the University of Pennsylvania joined edX with the intention of publishing three courses on the virtual education platform. Both schools were among Coursera’s first four partner universities and will continue to publish courses on Coursera’s platform as well.
With the creation of PrincetonX and PennX, edX now has six Ivy League partner’s to Coursera’s five. Princeton, Penn, and Columbia publish courses to both platforms. Today, Coursera lists over 133 total partner organizations on its website, while edX lists 82.
"As an edX co-founder, Harvard is gratified that peer institutions have chosen to become members,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who sits on edX’s board, wrote in an emailed statement.
EdX CEO Anant Agarwal said he believes that edX’s status as a non-profit makes it particularly attractive to universities.
“I would say that we are a non-profit, we have an open-source platform, and we’ve stayed true to our mission,” Agarwal said. “I think that as universities recognize that, the whole non-profit approach is appealing.”
Representatives from Penn and Princeton each cited different reasons for joining the edX consortium.
According to Deirdre Woods, executive director of Penn’s open learning team, Penn was attracted most to the new online audience that edX could offer.
“Exposing our faculty to other learners [on edX] is great, and I think the primary reason why we entered into MOOCs in the first place,” Woods said.
Woods also cited edX’s emphasis on offering a broader range of courses as a factor in the decision.
“Now that Coursera’s focus is increasingly on [specialized courses], which we have done a few of and will continue to do, edX provides flexibility of courses not just in terms of the slight difference in class form but also in terms of how you want to deliver your courses,” Woods said.
Penn’s first courses on the edX platform will consist of some they have previously run on Coursera and a new course on intellectual property designed specifically for edX.
Princeton, however, has no plans to publish the same courses on both platforms, according to Jeffrey D. Himpele, the director for teaching initiatives and programs at Princeton’s McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning.
Himpele said edX appealed to Princeton faculty who will now have the option of creating “on-demand” courses, which students can take any time the instructor has finished the content, as opposed to those on Coursera, or more “session-based” courses, which learners take on a timeline more similar to traditional university classes.
While Agarwal described himself as “delighted” to have Princeton and Penn in the edX consortium, he said he is always open to new members.
“We would be very happy to have Brown and Yale join edX as well, of course,” he said.

Harvard Business School has added another online learning initiative, HBX Live, to its current offerings in an effort to replicate many of the signature characteristics the HBS classroom.
“With HBX Live, we replicate the classroom, but we ignore geography entirely,” said Business School professor Bharat N. Anand.
HBX Live classrooms will exist entirely online and in real time. In a custom-designed WGBH studio, a high-resolution video wall mimics the amphitheater-style seating of an HBS classroom with up to 60 participants displayed on individual screens through a video feed from participants’ computer cameras.
“The teaching experience isn’t that different to a traditional HBS classroom,” said Anand. “It takes a little to get used to the new set up, but it feels dramatically similar to a traditional HBS classroom.”
A team of four videographers and studio managers are charged with creating an engaging and cohesive video feed of professors going over course material. The program aims to create a highly interactive online experience where professors can call on specific students who can answer questions as if they are physically present.
Jim Aisner, a spokesperson for the Business School, said there is virtually no delay in video feeds. In addition, others can audit sessions via an observer model that contains just the professor’s video feed with only a few seconds of delay.
Anand outlined three principles that guided the development of HBX Live: “The case studies method of learning, a highly interactive and engaging learning environment, and that students learn from each other.”
Students in HBX Live can take advantage of a host of features that extend beyond the traditional classroom experience at HBS, including the ability to answer questions, vote in polls, and interact through a chat function that projects comments of questions students have to each other and the professor in real time.
HBX Live is part of HBX, a larger HBS online education initiative. According to Peter K. Bol, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, three years ago the Business School opted to develop its own online learning platform, separate from Harvard’s edX platform, in order to provide a pedagogical approach more closely aligned with its teaching methods.
“One of the things to understand is that when you build a platform that’s meant to serve many many different people in many different ways, which is what edX is, you can’t build a platform to meet the demands that I might have for the particular way I want to teach,” said Bol.
Anand stated that future goals for HBX Live are to improve programming for alumni and scale the program to serve a larger number of students.
“HBX Live will help us deliver on our promise of lifelong learning by giving us a new way to engage students and alumni—not just here in Boston, but around the globe—as their professional and educational needs evolve over the course of their careers,”said Business School Dean Nitin Nohria in a press release.
HBX is only one of a number of programs for online business education.
The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania has a public online education program that has already served over a million students.
Yale’s School of Management is part of the Global Network of Advanced Management, an association of 27 business schools across the world that gives students the opportunity to take courses for credit online. According to David Bach, Yale professor and senior associate dean for Executive MBA and Global Programs, courses taken within the the Global Network of Advanced Management are included in regular tuition costs and use off-the-shelf technology.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers argued for concrete public policy solutions to economic inequality in front of a crowded audience Thursday evening at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
In a discussion called “The Challenge of Inclusion” with moderator John Authers, senior investment columnist for The Financial Times, Summers recommended policies such as progressive taxation and infrastructure investment. He said the American government should increase taxation on the wealthiest, not solely for redistribution purposes, but also to enable greater social mobility.
“We have a less progressive tax system today than we did 25 years ago,” Summers said. “I’m certainly not for the politics of envy, but I am for taxation based on ability to pay.”
Providing opportunities for economic advancement also involves providing employment, Summers said, such as through federal infrastructure projects.
He argued that the government is not spending enough money on public works, citing the Anderson Memorial Bridge as an example.
“It is beyond belief that the bridge across to the business school has been under repair for three and a half years,” Summers argued. “The Rhine is about three times as big. Patton built whole new bridges across the Rhine in one day.”
Summers criticized the fact that federal investment in infrastructure was stagnant when adjusted for inflation, especially in a country “where the interest rate is zero and where LaGuardia Airport is a pit.”
Summers also pointed to education as a source of income inequality.
“When you can pay $1,000 an hour, and that is the going price in parts of Manhattan, for an SAT tutor, then you’re going to be perpetuating inequality from one generation to the next,” he said.
He added that education should focus more on teaching how to think analytically and work effectively with others.
Summers went on to poke fun at his own interpersonal skills in reference to his troubled tenure as University president, to laughs from the audience.
“Everything I did when I worked in government, when I worked as president at Harvard, depended on my ability to work effectively with others—although I didn’t necessarily work so effectively, perhaps,” he said.
Speaking to the event’s title, Summers said these policy changes would work towards a model of economic growth that benefits everyone.
“Inclusive prosperity means economic growth in which everybody shares, and that is central to a healthy society,” he said. “By and large, societies succeed when parents can be confident that their children will lead better lives than they did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-three candidates are running for nine available Cambridge City Council positions in the city’s biennial elections, with seven of the nine incumbents joining together for a shared campaign platform.
All nine incumbents will be running for re-election. Of this group, seven have formed a shared platform named the “Unity Slate”: Mayor David P. Maher, Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan, Cambridge City Councillors Craig A. Kelley, Leland Cheung, Marc C. McGovern, E. Denise Simmons and Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.
The announcement of the shared platform came after the creation of another slate, “Slate for Cambridge City,” which was announced by Nadeem A. Mazen, a current city councilmember, in early August. That slate has emphasized a commitment to bringing newcomers into City Council to provide a spirit of activism. The candidate group includes Mazen, as well as Mariko Davidson, Romaine Waite, John Sanzone and School Committee candidate Jake Crutchfield.
Cambridge’s proportional representation system incentivizes the creation of such shared platforms, known as slates. Once candidates receive a prerequisite number of top votes, they are elected to City Council, and any surplus votes they would have received are distributed among their voter’s lower picks.
“We don’t always agree, but this team is committed to solving problems here in Cambridge by being open to all viewpoints,” Simmons said on the slate’s website.
Some candidates argue that the collective experience of the current incumbents is not enough to fit the city’s best interests. The prospect of having seven out of the nine previous incumbents running together has raised concerns of whether this may limit the ability of newcomers to break into and substantially impact the Council.
“They reminded the public that you’re either pro-incumbent or pro-new and innovative thinking,” Mazen said of the Unity Slate members. “They have really helped crystallize the understanding of the public and of the other candidates how powerful, dangerous and self-promoting incumbency can be.”
Members of the Unity Slate, however, argue that the diversity of opinions and experiences on their coalition already matches the diversity that newcomers might bring.
“Having been independently elected already, I think we demonstrate the diversity of our city,” Cheung said.
The Cambridge City Council is the central policy-making body for the city. Together, the nine councillors are expected to authorize public projects and budgeting, adopt regulations and ordinances, manage the taxes and finances of the city, and complete various legislative tasks. Furthermore, the members of the City Council must elect a Mayor and Vice-Mayor.
Election Day in Cambridge is Nov. 3. Polls will be open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.

Harvard officially launched its newest concentration, “Theater, Dance, and Media,” on Thursday night, marking the culmination of several years of effort to incorporate the dramatic arts more fully into the University’s academic offerings.
Members of the University administration and faculty, alumni, donors, and a few students gathered in Farkas Hall for remarks by University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen, Artistic Director of the American Repertory Theater Diane M. Paulus ’88, and the concentration’s first chair, English professor Martin Puchner.
 “This is a day full of hope and excitement and anticipation for all that the concentration will bring to Harvard,” Faust told the audience of about 250 that filled Farkas Hall's theater. “The arts nurture the curiosity and openness that are at the heart of everything we seek to do.”
The opening brought together high-level members of the University’s central administration, who mingled with prominent donors such as Andrew L. Farkas ’82 at a reception after the event. The new concentration is housed in Farkas Hall, named for Andrew Farkas’s father.
Relatively few students attended the invitation-only event, though around 20 undergraduates involved in campus theater filed out from the wings to join Paulus in a cheer of “TDM” on stage at the end of her speech.
The evening program, which included a dance performance by two recent Harvard graduates and the screening of a short video about the new program of study, also coincided with the launch of the concentration’s new website.
In their remarks, Faust, Sorensen, and Puchner emphasized that the new concentration reflects a broader commitment to integrating the arts into students’ academic experiences.
“The arts are central to the 21st century citizen that we are hoping to educate,” said Sorensen. “They involve curiosity, discovery, making, and risk-taking.”
The speakers also emphasized that this commitment has involved the collaboration of many in the administration and faculty. According to Puchner, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith secured the concentration its office space in Farkas Hall, while Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris provided guidance on the teaching methods and curricular focus of the new program. All three deans, along with members of the faculty in departments ranging from Music to English to History, attended the opening event.
Paulus emphasized that the new concentration will reach beyond the University to forge connections between undergraduates and professionals at the A.R.T., 11 of whom now serve as Theater, Dance, and Media faculty.
“I believe that our new concentration in TDM will produce the next generation of artists,” she said.
The opening of the concentration marks the culmination of a curriculum development project that began with the report of Harvard’s Task Force on the Arts in 2008, which called for the arts to become “an integral part of the cognitive life of the university.” The new concentration, Harvard’s first devoted specifically to theater, was approved unanimously by a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in April 2015.
For her part, Sorensen expressed satisfaction with the result of those years of work in an interview last week.
“It’s taken all this time to put the pieces together, to formulate the vision,” she said. “Martin Puchner, the chair, has done extraordinary work...to actually create a concentration that marries the academic study of theater—its history, its formal elements—with production, with the hands-on, collective-effort study of theater.”
She added that she believes the new program will render Harvard appealing to a more diverse, creative body of students.
“For years we kept thinking that any student interested in theater would go elsewhere,” she said. “Now we know that some are saying, ‘No, Harvard has this very unique and attractive program.’”

The number of reported rapes on Harvard’s Cambridge campus nearly doubled from 2013 to 2014, according to the Harvard University Police Department's annual security report released Thursday.
The increase in the number of reported campus rapes, from 17 in 2013 to 33 in 2014, comes with a smaller increase in the total number of reported sexual offenses. In 2014, there were 43 sexual offenses reported on campus, compared to 40 sexual offenses the year before. In the Harvard Police report, the term “sexual offense” refers to fondling, rape, incest, and statutory rape. 
Of the 33 reported rapes in 2014, six were classified as “unfounded,” which the report defines as “any report of a crime that is found to be false or baseless” after an investigation by law enforcement. There was one reported rape reported on the Longwood campus.
While Harvard led the Ivy League last year in the number of reported sex offenses, Dartmouth in 2014 had 55 instances of reported sex offenses, a term which includes “rape” and “fondling.”
The report, released in compliance with the federal Clery Act, includes statistics on crimes reported to Harvard Police, local law enforcement, and “campus security authorities,” who are University officials involved in student administration. In addition to crime statistics, the report included information on HUPD crime prevention efforts, crime reporting, and emergency notifications. Steven G. Catalano, a HUPD spokesperson, emailed the report to students on Thursday.
HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley wrote in the report that while crime may be low, Harvard students, faculty, and staff should remain vigilant.
“It is important for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to remember that we are located in an urban setting and must contend with many of the crime and safety issues that exist in any city,” Riley wrote.
The report noted that reported robberies reached a three-year low of 10, and the number of reported aggravated assaults reached a three-year low of seven. The number of burglaries, meanwhile, increased from 31 reported cases in 2013 to 40 reported instances in 2014.
The report indicated that the number of disciplinary actions taken for drug infractions in 2014  more than tripled since 2013; the number increased from seven to 22. There were 48 campus liquor law violations in 2014, down from 52 in 2013.
The sexual offense figures are released as the topic of sexual assault and harassment comes to the forefront of campus dialogue. Late last month, Harvard released what University President Drew G. Faust said were “deeply troubling” results of a campus-wide sexual assault climate survey. In particular, the survey found that 31 percent of surveyed senior women at Harvard College reported being victims of some kind of sexual misconduct—what the survey termed “non-consensual sexual contact.”
That survey also revealed students’ lack of confidence in and knowledge of Harvard’s reporting system for cases of sexual harassment and assault.  Eighty percent of female College students who reported having experienced nonconsensual penetration by incapacitation, and 69 percent of those who experienced penetration by force, did not file a formal report, according to a report on the survey by former provost Steven E. Hyman.

Two survivors of domestic abuse shared their experiences at an event in honor of the first day of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month on Thursday.
Spokesperson for the National Network to End Domestic Violence Victor R. Rivers and Dominique Donette, a student at the Graduate School of Education, spoke about growing up with physically and emotionally abusive fathers.
Following the discussion was a short question-and-answer session and a candlelight vigil at Memorial Church in remembrance of all who were affected by domestic violence, including one of Victor’s brothers, who died as a young child.
Rivers recalled his decision to confront his father in an effort to protect his mother and the rest of his family from being abused. Meanwhile, Donette’s speech focused on the many times she had to help her mother after she had been physically abused.
Both speakers stressed the importance of communities coming together in order to prevent violence.
Rivers alluded to his personal experiences with "angels and advocates," recalling how a teacher at school not only ensured that he was well-fed but also put him on the path to receive a high school scholarship. After getting a restraining order against his father, people he knew took him in as one of their own and cared for him, Rivers said.
After recalling their childhoods, Donette and Rivers said a collaborative effort was key to ending domestic violence.
"It’s up to us to shift the narrative," Donette said. "Our discomfort with talking openly and honestly is a concern.”
Rivers noted the difference in resources for victims of domestic violence compared to when he was a child, but recognized that a lot still had to be done to end the cycle of violence.
Rivers added that cycles of violence can occur within families and said that these cycles needed to be broken. As Rivers said, a significant number of prison inmates were the "victims and witnesses of family violence themselves."
Rivers’s son, Eli K. Rivas '16, was one of the organizers of the event.

The Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal approved revised plans for Harvard to renovate its Smith Campus Center on Thursday, giving the University permission from the city to move ahead with the construction project.
The board’s four-to-one vote comes after Harvard planners and architects met with the zoning board twice this summer in attempts to receive its approval, but a vote was delayed both times after pushback from local residents. Both the Cambridge Historical Commission and the Cambridge Planning Board have already backed Harvard’s plans to renovate the first, second, and 10th floors of the building, which is located at 1350 Massachusetts Ave. and formerly known as the Holyoke Center.
At previous hearings, Cambridge residents and other critics of Harvard’s design argued that the building was an encroachment on the historic Forbes Plaza and Harvard Square’s much-needed open spaces. Originally, plans stipulated that the campus center would include a “welcome plaza” with a two-story front facade, and critics described it as too grandiose.
On Thursday, Harvard-affiliated architects presented a revised version of its plan for the building, developed after officials sought input from several Cambridge residents who raised concerns about it this summer.
The approved plans feature a redesign of the front facade, with seven more feet of open outdoor space in Forbes Plaza. In addition, Harvard scrapped its initial proposal to add height to the building’s 10th floor, dodging a large zoning issue presented at earlier meetings.
The revised plans also allocate more space for chess tables, which will now stand at the center of the outdoor plaza. Chess players frequent the plaza today, and regulars showed up at the hearings this summer to criticize earlier drafts of the plans for neglecting the chess tables, which, according to one player, are world-renowned.
Landscaping also played a large part in the plans Harvard presented Thursday. The approved design includes five trees dividing the seating area adjacent to the building and the sidewalk on Mass. Ave.
Cambridge residents struck a starkly different tone in their reactions to the plans at the meeting Thursday. While at past hearings many were critical, during Thursday’s public comment period, local reactions to the updated plans were overwhelmingly positive.
“This is fantastic,” longtime resident James Williamson said. “I love it.”
Williamson had called the Smith Center a “Taj Mahal-like structure” at a hearing in late July and was part of a task force charged with working with Harvard architects to alter the designs to the public’s liking.
On Thursday, however, he was more optimistic. “It will not be detrimental to the public,” Williamson said.
Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem Mazen, who had criticized Harvard’s representatives for failing to incorporate public concerns in the previous plans, called Thursday’s hearing “city planning at its best.”
“It’s a fine day in Cambridge,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
After the board approved the plans, Williamson shared celebratory drinks with attendees from Harvard and other members of the public.
Construction on the building is expected to last until 2018.

South Carolina Governor Nikki R. Haley was honored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations on Thursday evening with a dinner ceremony to celebrate her contributions to the progress of racial justice.
Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter presented her with an award of appreciation for her calls to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol this past summer.
In remarks in Winthrop House, Haley described the bright future of a “New South” dedicated to tackling historical problems of racial and economic inequality. She also offered a defense of the Republican Party and its values in solving problems for low-income people and people of color in her state.
“I would not have won the Republican primary if this were a racially intolerant party,” said Haley, who is Indian American.
Haley entered the political spotlight this summer after nine black members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., were shot and killed, allegedly in a racially motivated attack by Dylann Roof. Haley called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol in the wake of the killings, and many people throughout the country celebrated her subsequent signing of the bill that took the flag down.
Reflecting on her choice to call for the removal of the flag, Haley said Thursday that “the State House belongs to all people, and it needed to be welcoming to all people.”
“That was not possible with the flag flying,” she concluded.
Haley spoke in depth about how South Carolina residents responded to this summer’s massacre, contrasting it with the violence that erupted in cities like Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore after killings of unarmed black people at the hands of police there.
Haley, while maintaining that “black lives do matter,” argued that the uprisings in other cities in fact hurt black people who face police violence. Charleston, in contrast, saw no violence in the wake of the church massacre, with Haley describing the local reaction as a peaceful coming together to mourn the loss of life.
While Haley’s remarks were met with applause, students who attended the ceremony were more mixed in their reactions.
Tyler S. Parker ’17, who attended the dinner ceremony, said Haley “spoke a lot about racial unity and peaceful conversations, and that really resonated with me as a moderate.” 
Still, Parker pushed back on the contrast Haley drew between the reactions to violence in Charleston and that in Ferguson and Baltimore, suggesting that the “volatile responses” seen there “probably created the social pressures” that made the peaceful response in South Carolina possible.
“It all just goes to show these conversations are pretty complicated,“ he said.
Haley met with University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana during her visit, according to Counter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior defensive end Denzel Paige and Georgetown wide receiver Marquis Wright are used to playing under the glare of Friday night lights, but that was four years ago, when they were on the same high school team at North Broward Prep.
Now they meet again, donning different uniforms and playing for different teams, but with the same excitement of a Friday night game. With a projected hurricane hitting the east coast this weekend, the atmosphere of the game may feel all too familiar for the Florida natives.
The Georgetown football team (2-2) will take on the Crimson squad (2-0, 1-0 Ivy League) in Harvard Stadium on Friday night. The retreat from the normal schedule of Saturday games means a shortened week of practice and the second night game at home for Harvard.
“It’s like any other week, but obviously there is a quick turnaround,” senior linebacker Jake Lindsey said. “There is more of a sense of urgency, but it’s the same schedule, same routine—just focus on getting better for the next game.”
In its first league matchup of the season, the Crimson dominated in all aspects of the game to deliver a trouncing to Brown, 53-27.
After such a convincing victory, it might be easy for a team to rest on its laurels and lose momentum going into a nonconference game, but not for Harvard.
“We only play 10 games. There are no playoffs, so next game, best game,” Lindsey said. “We are trying to go 3-0, then build upon that and hopefully win every game.”
According to Harvard coach Tim Murphy, the coaches and players see every game and every practice as simply an opportunity to improve and grow from the previous week’s performance.
“If you are staying the same, you are invisibly moving behind,” Murphy said. “We have to improve in all categories.”
The Hoyas are looking to dismantle the Crimson’s 16-game winning streak on their first visit to Cambridge, Mass. In last year’s matchup, Georgetown was unsuccessful in finding the end zone and fell to Harvard, 34-3.
Against the top-ranked FCS defense, the Hoyas were able to convert just 36 percent of their third downs.
Georgetown may be hard-pressed to move the chains again this weekend, when it faces a Harvard defense that didn’t allow any first downs to the Bears for the opening 21 minutes of last week’s game.
“[Last week was] just a confidence builder,” Lindsey said. “Against bad teams and even good teams, we have the ability to be very fundamental and also very accurate in how we play different schemes.”
But the Hoyas might have even more to worry about with an explosive Crimson offense that has put up 94 points over the last two games.
At the helm is senior quarterback Scott Hosch, who has completed 30 of 46 passes for 487 yards, six touchdowns, and only one interception this season.
The Georgetown defense will need to bring pressure against Hosch and close running lanes if it hopes to break the Crimson’s undefeated streak.
This may be a tall task for a team that gave up over 300 yards of offense—including 100 rushing yards—and 16 points in a close victory last week against a Columbia squad curently mired in a 23 game winless streak.
The Hoyas might be able to best the Crimson if they can protect the football Friday night. Georgetown has yet to drop a game when it does not turn the ball over.
But there’s a third player for this week’s matchup that may cause more turnovers than usual—the impending weather. With the threat of heavy rain, both teams will need to pay extra attention to protecting the football.
“We have been eyeing the forecast, and we see there might be a monsoon so we’ve changed the game plan a little,” said senior tight end Ben Braunecker. “We expect it to be pretty sloppy, not a lot of passing going on…. [We want to] keep it simple and try to out-physical them.”
Regardless of the weather, however, the team is excited to return to Friday night football.
“Our kids love night games,” Murphy said. “That’s how they grew up in high school football.”

White jerseys and gold pants. Black jerseys and crimson pants. Crimson jerseys and crimson pants.
Harvard football (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) may have looked different over the first three weeks of its season, but the team has played the same way—with total dominance.
For the third weekend in a row, the Crimson controlled all aspects of its matchup, this time jumping to a 31-0 halftime lead against Georgetown (2-3) before cruising to a 45-0 shutout at Harvard Stadium.
The result marked Harvard’s 17th consecutive win and the 150th victory of coach Tim Murphy’s Crimson career.
“It might be one of the best football teams I’ve seen since I started coaching at this level,” Hoyas coach Rob Sgarlata said. “They’re well-coached, ran the ball very well, and executed the entire time.”
Already up 10 at the end of the first quarter, Harvard restarted play with a bang—the team’s third blocked punt of the season. On this night, it was sophomore cornerback Tanner Lee who lunged forward to deflect the kick.
Six plays later, junior running back Paul Stanton reaped the rewards, taking a handoff, bouncing off a blocker, and outracing the secondary to secure a touchdown and a 17-0 lead. He finished with 113 yards, all of them before halftime.
“I’ve never seen so many blocked punts,” Murphy said. “I hope we haven’t used up our allotment for the year, but we’ve done a great job pressuring the punter in a lot of really creative ways.”
It didn’t get better for the visitors. On the next possession, Georgetown quarterback Kyle Nolan dropped back on second-and-13 only to absorb a blind-side hit from junior defensive lineman Miles McCollum.
The ball popped out, and captain Matt Koran grabbed it. Freshman running back Noah Reimers completed the swing two plays later with a jump-cut touchdown, pushing the margin to 24.
That defensive takeaway was just one highlight of many in an impressive performance for the unit, which held the Hoyas to 222 yards. Five players recorded at least four tackles.
“We have a lot of great athletes out there,” senior linebacker Eric Medes said. “[We] just know how to put [ourselves] in the right place at the right time with the game plan.”
Reimers also played a consistent role, largely thanks to the early and sizable lead that Harvard built. Along with the score after the Koran fumble recovery, the freshman added two goal-line touchdowns in the third quarter and drew an enthusiastic reaction from the crowd after hurdling a defender midway through the period.
In the red zone, however, Reimers shared scoring opportunities with senior quarterback Scott Hosch, who plunged into the end zone at the end of the second quarter. That score capped a 10-play drive and sent the Hoyas into halftime facing a 31-point deficit.
The lopsided score line obscured a few instances of early sloppiness from the Crimson. In the first quarter, Harvard’s kickoff return team surrendered an average of 28 yards, and the referees penalized the Crimson three times.
One of these whistles, a call for an illegal block on the defense, gave Georgetown a 33-yard field-goal attempt. But Hoyas kicker Henry Darmstadter pulled the kick wide left, setting the stage for a long night for the visitors.
By that point, Harvard already held a 10-0 lead. The Crimson’s first drive of the night had stalled in the red zone, giving sophomore Kenny Smart the opportunity to convert the first field goal of his career, a 31-yard boot.
With 12:45 left in the fourth quarter, Darmstadter had a chance to one-up Smart when Georgetown lined up for a 42-yard field-goal attempt. But the long snapper delivered a low ball, ending the Hoyas’ last best chance at breaking the shutout.
Harvard’s steady domination meant that for the third straight week, the second team saw major action. Six different players took handoffs and 11 caught passes to combine with a first team attack to produce 245 yards on the ground and 249 in the air. On the defensive side, 29 different players recorded tackles.
Still, it was the Crimson first-teamers who jumpstarted the rout in the first quarter.
On Harvard’s second possession, the team drove inside the red zone before Reimers lost the ball at the five-yard-line. But the Crimson recovered, and on the next play, Stanton pushed forward for the score, the first of six rushing touchdowns on the night.
“The bottom line is, the preseason is over,” Murphy said. “Taking nothing away from Georgetown and the two teams we’ve played thus far, we’re going to face a much steeper climb over the next several weeks.”

UPDATED: October 6, 2015, at 3:42 a.m.
If you’ve been on this campus for even a single mildly cold day, you’ve seen the H Sweater. It’s either cream or crimson and it’s adorned with an obnoxious, torso-sized “H,” in case anyone forgot what letter this University’s name starts with.
Like every good fall tradition– pumpkin spice lattes and the changing of the leaves– we haven’t seen the H Sweaters since last year. But fall is back, and so are the sweaters. Your options are plenty this year– you can head over to The Harvard Shop, or (if you can’t choose between the literal three Harvard Shops in a one mile radius) you can order one from Hillflint.
You might notice that the Hillflint sweaters will cost you from $85 to $95, while the Harvard Shop’s will cost you $129.99, or $103.99 with an in-store student discount (Flyby did not seek comment as to whether an arm and a leg would be enough to cover the cost). What’s up with the price difference? Could it be that the Harvard Shop sweaters are 100% wool, while the Hillflint ones are a 60 percent/40 percent Cotton/Acrylic blend (for the $85 sweater) or 100% merino (for the $95 sweater)? Of course not. The extra $44.99 is to have the privilege of seeing the photo shoot of Harvard students rocking these sweaters.
(Note: both vendors also offer sweaters with your class year on them, but then you might forget what letter to put before “arvard”)

Remember when members of the Harvard Community Garden planned ‘Farmal: The Real Garden Party,’ and over 4,000 people replied that they were going on Facebook? Remember when the event was then cancelled due to concerns from administration? Yeah, we at Flyby were heartbroken too.
And while we are pretty bummed that Garden Party (by that we mean Farmal) season is officially over, we’re pretty pumped for [BLANK] Party next Friday, October 9th in the Science Center Plaza. At first glance, the Facebook event doesn’t seem to answer all of the burning questions one might have when their weekend plans are involved, so Flyby sought them out for you:
First, what is [BLANK] Party? Why is it blank? It’s an event hosted by a group of women on campus, looking to bring friends and strangers from all corners of campus together for an evening. “Equally important was putting ownership and power over the Harvard social scene in the hands of women for a night,” according to Hajar El Fatihi ’17, one of the organizers of the event. The [BLANK] theme, according to El Fatihi, was so “that people should feel free to “fill in the blank” with whatever they identity...We wanted students to feel like this could be [MY] Party.”
Will they play “Blank Space”? No word on whether T-Swift has made it onto the night’s playlist yet, but partygoers will have a live band and two DJs to look forward to. The Ex Feds, described by event organizer Madeline Hung ’16 on Facebook as “Black Tie Affair’s favorite band,” will be playing from 9 to 11 p.m., when DJ Pong and DJ Yashi will take over till 1 a.m.
As for the mystifying ‘[ ]’ dress code– seriously, what? I can barely dress myself in business casual, and that at least has an adjective in it– the event organizers chose to leave it ambiguous so that people wear whatever they’re most comfortable with. Although they highly advised Facebook commenters to not show up naked (which, seeing as it gets down to like 40° at night now, Flyby endorses).
Maybe we just all need a chance to get together and dance for a night. The point of the party, according to El Fatihi, was to “remind all students here that no matter which organizations they belong to or not, they always deserve a place to have fun with their friends on the weekends... We definitely think that this event reflects the changing social atmosphere on campus.”
