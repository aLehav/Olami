After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Food can be a homecoming.
A bite of home cooking can be a momentary portal to a place of comfort and familiarity. Even if one can’t actually return home in the thick of the semester, there’s nothing better than a dish that smells and tastes like home.
Often, that home cannot be found at Harvard. The Chinese food at Annenberg Hall — the freshman dining hall at Harvard — is acceptable at best and dismal at worst. Improvements have been made in the form of the occasional potsticker day, yet this does not erase traumatic memories of Berg “fried” rice (aka raw kernels slathered in soy sauce).
Left to seek other methods of reconnecting with one’s heritage, Chinatown’s bakeries provide a suitable alternative. Self-care is important, and a warm egg tart or fresh baked pineapple bun can bring a spot of joy into everyday life. Visiting these bakeries also provides a welcome yet accessible way to get outside of the Harvard bubble: Chinatown is a mere 20 minute T ride away.
With AAPI month fast approaching, Asians and allies alike should take this chance to connect with — and learn about — Asian culture through food. Read on to find out which Chinatown bakery comes out on top!
3. Corner Cafe Bakery
Positioned prominently at an intersection of the busy Harrison Avenue of Chinatown, the Corner Cafe Bakery is located in a prime spot for roping in curious tourists.
In terms of atmosphere, Corner Bakery Cafe has a more polished, commercialized feel. All products are neatly packaged in plastic and tidily arranged on the shelves. The floor is carefully swept, the shelves dominated by classics like pork buns and carefully scored pineapple buns.
Overall, this bakery can be described as typical. The emphasis on polish is impressive, but aside from its Asian offerings, feels like a Paris Baguette dupe — the typical mom-and-pop appeal of Asian bakeries is masked by the sanitized atmosphere. Though there’s nothing wrong with sticking with the classics, this bakery’s pastry selection also seems to pander to an unfamiliar, Western audience that may find their offerings more palatable. All in all, this bakery may be an ideal place for tourists, but not the most authentic way to experience Chinese pastries.
2. Ho Yuen Bakery 
Ho Yuen Bakery is quite literally a hole in the wall. Although the overhead sign announces its existence, the door is difficult to find in the midst of packed buildings, and the single display window is eternally foggy. Trays of pastries remain stacked in the middle of the floor, and all of the goods are crammed together into a single display case at the cash register.
These details are meant to recommend it — the small, unassuming bakery rewards those who dare to venture in with delicious pineapple buns with crumbly, imperfect toppings and more niche Chinese favorites like savory turnip cakes. Aesthetics are less of a focus for this bakery, yet the taste more than makes up for it. Although this bakery is perhaps less approachable for first-time visitors, it will undoubtedly become a fast favorite.
1. Taiwan Bakery 
Taiwan Bakery is the best of both worlds, with beginner friendly favorites interspersed with Asian household staples. Like Ho Yuen, it is a street-side location, and yet, the display window is filled with gleaming, golden pastries. It specializes in moon cakes of all kinds, though their classic buns are also delicious. Pork floss buns, which may appear daunting to a newcomer, are sold alongside Western-adapted cream buns. Each sign is handwritten in both English and Chinese characters; although the English translations are imperfect, they may uniquely appeal to Asian-Americans looking to finally learn the names of their childhood favorites.
In this way, Taiwan Bakery is the Platonic ideal of a Chinese bakery for beginners and experienced visitors alike: specialty goods, a broad appeal to many audiences, and an authentic feel that makes customers — especially AAPI ones — immediately feel at home. Though it is difficult for a bakery to cater to every customer, it succeeds at striking the balance. For those who haven’t yet found their favorite Chinese pastries and baked goods, it may be wise to begin one’s exploration here.

As the results of the trial were read out by the jury, Gwyneth Paltrow nodded calmly, her hands folded on the table before her. She exhaled a sigh of relief — she had won.
Paltrow — the Goop C.E.O. and Oscar-winning actress most famous for her roles as Margot Tenenbaum in “The Royal Tenenbaums,” Marge Sherwood in “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” and Pepper Potts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — won her court case in March after being sued by Terry Sanderson for allegedly crashing into him on a ski slope in Utah. Refusing to settle, Paltrow chose to defend her name and reputation in the courtroom, countersuing Sanderson’s $300,000 lawsuit for $1.
Because of comments made by Sanderson’s attorney, such as “You’re small but mighty,” “Are you good friends with Taylor Swift?” as well as an unnecessarily lengthy discourse about Paltrow’s height, on which the attorney commented, “Okay, I am so jealous,” Paltrow’s trial garnered an extensive amount of media coverage, including articles in The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The New Yorker.
Yet, above all, it was Paltrow’s casual indifference that drew the spotlight. From her curated and muted wardrobe — highlighted for its expensive sophistication — and her artisan water bottles sourced from the Ouachita Mountains, to her calm and polite demeanor, Paltrow exuded the life she leads as an emblem of fashion, cinema, and lifestyle brands.
While the media seems to have focused on some of her striking comments — when asked in her testimony, for example, how the incident affected her vacation, Paltrow replied “Well, I lost half a day of skiing” — there was little emphasis on the actual technicalities of the trial. With money not necessarily being Paltrow’s primary concern, it’s hard not to think that a settlement would have been easier. But, she chose the more difficult route of taking the time to clear her name. At the end of the day, she was sued, she responded, and she won.
More than a week after entering the courtroom for the first time wearing an alpine cream turtleneck sweater, sleeves pushed up to her elbows, aviator glasses, and wrists adorned with gold bracelets, ready to refute Sanderson’s allegations, Paltrow finally walked out of the courtroom victorious, allegedly whispering, to Sanderson, “I wish you well.”

Readers may expect Paris Hilton’s memoir to be full of pink dresses, diamonds, fashion advice, famous name drops, and lavish parties. While all of these can be found in Paris Hilton’s new book, “Paris: The Memoir,” they only adorn the background of this portrait of a raw, relatable life. Through strikingly clear writing, Paris Hilton deconstructs her public image. Hilton does not force relatability, using her genuine prose and naturally witty humor to highlight the parts of her life that paparazzi and TV cameras never could.
The less publicized realities of Hilton’s life lay the foundation of this work. Readers learn about Hilton’s struggles with ADHD, the motivations behind her party-girl persona in her teenage years, and her struggles with her family. The recollections of her adolescence center around one of the most tragic and personal moments of the book: her harrowing experience at a troubled teen facility called CEDU.
She details her forceful removal from home in 1997, which led to her two-year confinement in a facility called CEDU — a place where her parents, concerned for her safety, sent her at age 16 for safety concerns after her months of late-night partying. Hilton describes the disturbing experiences she faced at this facility, where “disobedient ravers from conservative families and ADHD kids who got kicked out of school” were sent.
With the agility of a seasoned writer, Hilton brings life to the verbally abusive false group therapy sessions, sexual abuse, drugging, psychological manipulation, and demanding physical labor she faced at CEDU. Hilton achieves a closeness that goes beyond a memoir’s typical intimacy with its readers; her illuminative imagery allows her audience to develop deep empathy for her and other teenagers forced into these camps.
What stands out most in Hilton’s memoir is the unique way she structures her story. In the book’s prologue, Hiton details her experience with ADHD and describes how this has shaped her life.
“Because my attention span is limited, I don’t see time as linear,” writes Hilton, “the ADHD brain processes past, present, and future as a Spirograph of interconnected events, which gives me a certain Spidey sense about fashion trends and technology.”
Hilton spins a web of stories that bounces back and forth between her present and her past, writing in a way that, as Hilton describes, models a conversation with her as someone with ADHD. This restless motion through the memoir is unexpectedly clarifying; readers gain more insight into Paris’s perspective as moments that readers are familiar with from early 2000s media are tied to personal stories that describe Paris’s thoughts at the time. This connect-the-dots storytelling style engages the reader by mixing a thoughtful and intellectual voice with the familiar Paris-isms entrenched in popular culture.
With an articulate and confident voice, Hilton presents herself as the Paris she herself defines, not the character that people may encounter on reality television.
This vulnerability woven through the memoir allows Hilton to align herself with her audience. In a particularly unguarded moment, Hilton writes about how she came to terms with her asexuality, in light of her recognition as a “sex symbol.”
When reflecting on her time at CEDU and its impacts on her life now, Hilton writes, “The ironic thing is, because of the abuse and degradation I survived as a teen — and maybe partly because of the way I was raised — I feared sex.”
In a way, Hilton’s memoir is the permission that readers have been waiting for. For such a powerful icon to come forward and openly accept herself and share her truths may be the inspiration that other readers need.
“I promised myself I would be truthful,” writes Hilton, “and I know that there’s someone out there who needs to hear that they're not weird or frigid or dead inside — they’re just who they are at this moment: an asexual person in a hypersexualized world.”
Bringing things full circle, Hilton shares her activist work in Washington D.C. where she lobbies legislators to create regulatory laws against the troubled teen industry. Her work includes planning rallies and protests and spreading awareness about her experience, particularly through a podcast called “Trapped in Treatment” which she hosts alongside fellow troubled teen industry survivor, Caroline Cole.
Wrapped in a rather unassuming pink book jacket, “Paris: The Memoir” is a transformative experience. Throughout the memoir, Hilton defies readers’ preconceived notions, writing with a confidence that paints herself in the light she deserves. Her hard-hitting messages radiate self-awareness and tenacity, resonating deeply with both audiences who have followed her since the early 2000s and those who are just learning of her story.

More than 1600 students packed into the stands of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center Saturday evening for one of Harvard’s most annually anticipated events, Eleganza MMXXIII: “Rebirth.”
During the three hour show, students across Harvard’s campus came together to celebrate fashion, dance, music, and expression.
On an elevated runway-style platform, the student-run production represented cultures from across the globe. Radically challenging social conventions, especially those pertaining to gender and sexuality, Eleganza transformed the stadium into an immersive, captivating space.
The event drew resounding praise from the student crowd, some of whom traveled from the Boston area or further in order to see the show.
U.K. visiting student Lucia Vives said she had heard “great” things about the show. “It was a once in a lifetime experience here at Harvard,” she said.
Lauren Huions, a student from Columbia University, said she came to support her friend Michelle.
“Eleganza is for a great cause, and I’m so excited to be here,” she said.
“Rebirth” opened with “Scene I: E Pluribus Unum.” Scene directors Aimee R. Howard ’25 and Daylan N. Davis ’25 aimed to create a sense of community on stage that invites a celebration of difference and a spirit of collectivism.
Saskia Fisher ’23 said, “I've never felt so many emotions watching a stage and that energy from the crowd is so contagious.”
Lily B. Roberts ’25 also responded with enthusiasm: “Amy Ojeaburu [the Fashion and Publicity Executive Producer of Eleganza] has done a great job with the show and I love seeing how it’s developed after the past few years,” she said.
In between scenes, BMF Step — the Black Men’s Forum Step team— guest performed.
“BMF Step carried,” said Chelsea P. Baker ’24.
Isabelle C. Montoute ’24 and Isaiah E. Coleman ’23 directed “Scene 2: Ill Intent,” a dance scene featuring hip-hop and street-heavy dance styles.
At intermission, Emilio De Leon ’23 said, “This is the best event I’ve been to in my four years at Harvard.”
Julia S. Casas ’24 said she loved the show: “Everyone is incredibly talented. The outfits are amazing. And I'm just so impressed with all the dancing and the different styles of dance as well,” she said.
Prefrosh Jhansi Bhavsar ’27 described the show as “amazing.”
“It makes me so excited to come to Harvard. And I'm definitely very inspired,” she said.
Eleganza also featured guest performances from Omo Naija X The Wahala Boys and Harvard Bhangra.
Priya Thelapurath ‘24, one of the captains of the Bhangra team, enjoyed watching the other performances when Bhangra wasn’t performing on stage.
“I've seen Eleganza ever since my freshman year. I love it so much so [I’m] really excited to get to be a part of it this year,” she said.
Eleganza MMXXIII: “Rebirth” finally closed with “Scene 3: The Icon,” directed by Isabelle L. Guillaume ’24 and Norah R. Ostin ’25, which pays homage to and celebrates black women, queer and trans people, and others that have helped create the roots of pop culture — especially ballroom culture.
The show concluded to roaring applause and cheering from those crowded around the runway as well as throughout the stadium.
Samantha M. Woolf ’23 shared her amazement of watching Eleganza: “Every time I go to a show like this, I'm just so amazed by the sheer talent of our classmates. They are so incredible,” Woolf said. “These are people sitting next to you in section or maybe dozing off in lecture, but they're just such incredible talent. Amazing show.”
Kaylee Cornelius ‘23 said, “The show was freaking amazing. They did so good. The dancers, the fashion, everything was awesome. They put in so much hard work. It was cool to see it play out.”
Supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion beyond the Harvard community, all proceeds from the 2023 Eleganza show were donated to NEFA, Advancement Project, and AgitArte.
Eleganza, established in 1994, was initially founded 28 years ago under Harvard’s undergraduate cultural production organization, Black C.A.S.T.
The event began as a small fashion show with a mission rooted in redefining beauty and aesthetic style on campus. “Rebirth” has clearly proven that Eleganza has since grown to become one of Harvard’s most annually anticipated events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
22-year-old Maia, better known as singer-songwriter and internet phenomenon mxmtoon, sat down with The Harvard Crimson on April 21 to talk about her career, creative evolution, and how far she’s come from her beginnings as an artist.
mxmtoon describes her music as “bedroom pop.” Though she is no longer making music largely by herself, she still aims to preserve that intimate and vulnerable sound.
“Having started in like my actual bedroom and making songs on GarageBand and sharing it, I still feel that that kind of intimacy and core is what I strive to do with a lot of the music I end up making,” she shared.
“I really identify with the idea of making something that feels personal to you, especially in environments that you feel really comfortable in. Bedroom pop feels cozy.”
mxmtoon’s songwriting has frequently been touted as “confessional,” and she said her songwriting perhaps “naturally turns into an autobiographical narrative.”
“I do feel like you could listen front to back and have a pretty good sense of my story so far, which is really cool to me. I think I approach it with more intentionality now, but it definitely was something that I was trying to do but naturally happened anyways,” she said.
mxmtoon’s second studio album, “rising,” was released almost a year ago, and she called it “the music that I always ended up dreaming of making.” Featuring more production than her stripped-back debut studio album “the masquerade” — self-released in 2019 — along with maturer lyrics, “rising” is a love letter to the trials of new adulthood and coming into your own.
“‘rising’ was fulfilling that dream I had five years ago, or even as young as six years old and listening to music for the first time and being like, ‘Oh my God, I hope I can make songs that make me feel this way and make me want to dance and smile and experience joy,’” she said.
In addition to her music, mxmtoon has taken on other creative avenues, releasing a short daily podcast beginning in September of 2020 and lasting a year titled “365 days with mxmtoon” as well as two graphic novels accompanying her debut album and connected 2020 EPs respectively. She discussed the exciting challenge of undertaking these endeavors.
“It felt really natural to me, actually — I think largely, mxmtoon has always been a multi-project project, right? Music is the core of what I do, but I do so many other things,” she shared. “Podcasting or graphic novels, those are all genuine interests of mine, and so trying to do my best and put my best foot forward in those different areas felt like a really individually satisfying thing to take on. And so I try to do that with mxmtoon as often as I can.”
mxmtoon rose to prominence self-releasing music on YouTube in 2017, but has kept up with a changing digital landscape — she has over 200,000 followers on Twitch, over 850,000 followers on Instagram, and 2.8 million followers on TikTok. When asked about her active online presence, she said “influencer” is not a label she feels an affinity towards.
“Content creator definitely feels accurate, I make a lot of music and see myself as a creative,”she said. “ I grew up in the early days of YouTube, watching blogs and youtubers generally. I feel like I am still solidly connected to that world and in a lot of ways I can’t detach myself from it.”
Now that she has an established following, she has a lot more freedom and resources to make the music she wants.
“I started my music project and no one in my real life knew about it. I wasn’t fearing of the fact that I was making music with my family or my friends,” she said. “I’m 22. I’m a little bit older than I was when I started and so from more confidence and just seeking out other people to help me and support me and whatever ideas I might have, so from a creative standpoint, I think I understand the power of asking for help a lot more than I used to.”
Given how public-facing her persona has been from a young age, an awareness of the distinction between public and private is present in how mxmtoon thinks about her music, as well as how she discusses her art.
“It’s a very strange experience going from making music thinking no one’s gonna ever listen to it but all of a sudden knowing that people will listen to it every single time we make something.”
“vulnerability is a really powerful tool, and I try to be as honest as possible in the music I make, but I also know I don’t owe anybody explanations beyond the lyrics that I’m making.”, she added.
mxmtoon has collaborated with many artists, from Carly Rae Jepson to Noah Kahan, and will be touring this summer under the umbrella bittersweet daze with cavetown, Ricky Montgomery, and grentperez.
“I’ve worked with all of them in different capacities and so it naturally kind of came together, this idea of wanting to do a mini festival lineup this summer and playing in different cities together,” she said. “I get to hang out with people I think are really cool and I get to play amphitheaters for the first time ever, which is super, super exciting,”
mxmtoon reflected on how far she has come since her music was a pipe dream she kept all to herself, and from its conception has been very personal. But she also knows that the songs she has made and written have naturally grown beyond just her.
“I know that my songs and the things that I make are going to become pieces of other people’s stories beyond just mine.”

Earl Lee, a Korean-Canadian Assistant Conductor for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, reflected on his journey in music and the mentors who have shaped his path following his debut in Symphony Hall on April 6. Alongside pianist Eric Lu, Lee presented a stunning performance with selections from Unsuk Chin, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Robert Schumann.
When selecting the three pieces for the program, Lee had Beethoven in mind.
“We tried to have a connective element that binds everything together, and funny enough that it’s Beethoven.”
The first piece of the program was by Korean-born composer Unsuk Chin, “subito con forza.” The work was written in 2020 as a tribute to the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth.
This was followed with Mozart’s iconic “Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor, K. 466,” a composition featuring a piano cadenza written by Beethoven that highlighted the impressive talent of soloist Eric Lu.
“People can hear how beautiful he plays, how he phrases. Where he takes time, where he breathes,” Lee said.
Lee lovingly reminisced on his growth as a conductor and accredited an early lesson from the late musician and conductor Bernard Haitink for his current ease and mastery in leading an orchestra as prominent and world-renowned as the BSO. As a student, Lee participated in a masterclass where his conducting skills were developed through leading an orchestra under Haitink’s guidance.
“What I always tell myself conducting is really what Maestro Haitink said — ‘Be clear and be there, but don’t disturb them’ — especially with a really amazing orchestra like BSO,” Lee shared.
One of Lee’s biggest takeaways was from witnessing the errors of another student conductor.
“He [the student conductor] was totally into it, moving a lot and passionate. And he [Haitink] just came and stopped him and said ‘Hey, try to not disturb them and stay out of their way, they’re really busy playing.’ And that really stuck with me for a long time,” he said.
Understanding the importance of trusting each individual musician within an orchestra rather than serving as an overbearing influence is one piece of advice that has stuck with Lee throughout his conducting career as he leads groups such as the San Francisco Symphony, Seoul Philharmonic, and Ann Arbor Symphony.
The final piece in Lee’s Symphony Hall debut was Schumann’s “Symphony No. 2” and the last movement quotes Beethoven’s “An die ferne Geliebte,” which drove the program’s unity home.
Lee also described the complexities of conducting a group of talented musicians.
“You sometimes ride along that or sometimes you try to steer the water into a different direction in a very subtle and clear way and it’s really fun,” he said.
Working with highly-skilled members of the BSO is undoubtedly an incredible opportunity for any conductor. Lee, however, is not typically limited to professional settings and also finds delight in mentoring young musicians.
“My goal was always treating the young musicians in the youth orchestra as my colleagues, not as their teacher,” Lee stated.
In the past, Lee shared that he has found rewarding experiences through his roles as the Artistic Director and Conductor for the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra and as Music Director for the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra.
“Seeing them experience what I have experienced in that same seat when I was 13 years old. This spark of magic in their eyes — it’s really moving.”
Lee’s own beginnings as a young, budding cellist were in the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra, though he says that he did not anticipate his return.
“When I got asked to work as a conductor later in my life, which I never expected, it was so special.”
After reminiscing on his accomplished career, Lee emphasized the importance of music for those involved in music at any level.
“My goal is not to make everyone fall into music. I mean, to have them go into music [as a profession] that’s not the point,” Lee said. “Music is such a great way – especially playing together – is such a great way to just build friendship and to build our personality. I really think it’s food for our soul and peace.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While “show tunes” may call to mind retro kick-lines or sappy love songs, musical theater is not a thing of the past. For decades, audiences have flocked to Broadway theaters, high school auditoriums, black box spaces, and everywhere in between to experience the magic of live theater firsthand. Musical theater is a constantly evolving amalgamation of different genres and trends, and its ever-changing sound makes it one of the most compelling music styles to engage with.
Here is a list of Broadway essentials, divided into Golden Age classics, fan-favorites, and genre-bending tracks from contemporary works — compiled by two self-described “Theater Kids” but intended for the even most inexperienced listener. Whether you’re a show tune skeptic or a loud and proud Theater Kid, these songs will transport you to the theater.
Golden Age: 
“The Sound of Music” — “The Sound of Music”
Julie Andrews running through the alps in the 1965 movie adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s beloved musical will forever be ingrained in cultural consciousness. With heartwarming romance, nuns (they’re shockingly common in musical theater), and one of the best voices in the business, “The Sound of Music” is a genre defining classic. Skip to 1:35 to hear the soaring high notes that made Julie Andrews a Dame.
“Maria” — “West Side Story”
Leonard Bernstein’s heartbreaking retelling of “Romeo and Juliet” set amidst the rivalry of two teenage street gangs offers some of the most beautiful orchestrations, complex characters, and iconic dance fights in the genre. This song takes place right after Bernstein’s star-crossed lovers meet for the first time, and perfectly captures the exhilarating rush of first love.
“I Could Have Danced All Night” — “My Fair Lady”
Audrey Hepburn’s portrayal of the lovable Eliza Doolittle made “My Fair Lady” a Hollywood classic. Generations of audiences have frolicked, danced, and fallen in love to “I Could Have Danced All Night.” But here’s a Hollywood secret: The lilting soprano voice behind Eliza’s iconic songs actually belongs to Marni Nixon, the same ghost singer who dubbed Natalie Wood’s Maria in “West Side Story.”
“Don’t Rain on My Parade” — “Funny Girl”
The 2023 Broadway revival starring “Glee”’s Lea Michele brought “Funny Girl” back into the public consciousness, and we couldn’t be more grateful. The bittersweet musical comedy chronicling the life of Fanny Brice features classic fast-paced numbers and ballads alike. “Don’t Rain on My Parade” will inspire you to adopt Fanny’s optimism and confidence — though maybe not the ability to belt a high D.
Theater Kid Staples:
“Defying Gravity” — “Wicked”
Before her “Frozen” fame, Broadway darling Idina Menzel originated the role of Elphaba in Stephen Schwartz’s adaptation of “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,” and musical theater was never the same. Today, “Defying Gravity” is any Broadway belter’s bread and butter and a staple in high school audition rooms across the country.
“One Day More” — “Les Miserables”
The iconic refrain of revolutionaries chanting “Do you hear the people sing?” defines the beloved pop-opera musical “Les Misérables” in contemporary pop culture. A more musically complex number that is just as evocative of the French Revolution, “One Day More” encapsulates the intense melodrama and beautiful haunting refrains that characterize the musical.
“The Phantom of the Opera” — “The Phantom of the Opera”
There’s a reason Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “The Phantom of the Opera” holds the record for Broadway’s longest-running show. Though its curtains recently closed, Phantom’s chill-inducing high notes, opulent costuming and set design, and, of course, iconic title sequence will live on. That organ run alone is (maybe) enough to redeem Webber for “Cats.”
“Seasons of Love” — “Rent”
We’ve spent “five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes” listening to Jonathan Larson’s “Rent.” Inspired by Giacomo Puccini’s opera “La bohème,” “Rent” follows a group of friends living in downtown New York City during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Though Larson tragically died before “Rent”’s Broadway debut, his legacy lives on through this Broadway juggernaut and his autobiographical musical, “Tick, Tick…Boom!”
“Opening: I Hope I Get It” — “A Chorus Line”
It’s meta. What better way to learn about musicals than listening to a musical about aspiring Broadway performers vying for eight coveted chorus line spots? “A Chorus Line” captures Broadway’s cutthroat culture in witty up-tempo ensemble dance numbers and dramatic ballads characteristic of the musical theater canon.
Contemporary: 
“She Used To Be Mine” — “Waitress”
Sara Bareilles rocked the world with her transition from pop star to musical theater composer, and this touching ode to what could have been showcases Bareilles’s singer-songwriter background. Blending the driving power of musical theater with Bareilles’s characteristic lyrical prowess, “She Used to Be Mine” brings down the house every time. If that wasn’t convincing enough, “Waitress” originated at Cambridge’s very own American Repertory Theater, so it is a particular must-watch for all Harvard students!
“Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story” — “Hamilton”
No musical theater list could be complete without a selection from “Hamilton.” Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton” is single-handedly responsible for making musical theater — and the founding fathers — cool. The hip-hop rap musical took the world by storm in 2015, breaking ground with its genre-bending sound and racially diverse casting of the founding fathers. The moving finale contains many of the musical’s main refrains, and is the perfect summary for those who somehow still haven’t listened to the full cast recording.
“Wait for Me (Reprise)” — “Hadestown”
We’ll be honest — we chose the reprise of this ensemble number simply to include Eva Noblezada’s incredible belt, which cuts through composer Anaïs Mitchell’s mesmerizing harmonics as clear as a bell. This tension-building number will have your heart racing before the inevitable tragic ending of Mitchell’s “Orpheus and Eurydice” adaptation.
Bonus: Jukebox Musicals
“Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)” — “Mamma Mia!”
Though this subgenre of musicals written around popular songs has taken over Broadway in recent years, none of the recent additions has been able to live up to “Mamma Mia!” Combining ABBA, Greece, and disco dance numbers — what could be better?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newest exhibit in The Neil L. & Angelica Zander Rudenstine Gallery at The Hutchins Center is a powerful and impressive curated collection of art dedicated to the memory of Lucy, Betsey, and Anarcha, three Black women who were enslaved and medically tortured by Dr. James Marion Sims, a man regarded as the father of gynecology. The exhibit’s array of mediums featuring sculptures, paintings, videos, and photographs, outlines a bittersweet memorial which connects past to present.
This project, which was curated by Dell Marie Hamilton, officially opened on March 30 and features 24 works created by several artists. It is co-sponsored by the Resilient Sisterhood Project, a non-profit organization that promotes healthcare advocacy concerning women of African descent impacted by diseases of the reproductive system.
An impressive amount of historical background and research accompanies the exhibit, detailing the ways the art pieces intersect with history while uncovering the dark truths behind anthropology, sociology, and our overall medical system.
Six of the pieces were created by Jules Arthur, who wanted to capture the three women through mixed media paintings. The first piece in the exhibit, “Mothers of Gynecology” (2019) features the three women in a textured frame. Below their portrait Sims includes speculums Sims used in his experiments and an insert of Robert Thom’s painting “J. Marion Sims: Gynecologic Surgeon,” from “The History of Medicine.” Arthur’s attention to detail is apparent in his depiction of each woman, as he gives each of them distinct features, and grave expressions that force the spectator to confront them and the subject matter at hand.
“He tries to give them some dignity, by sort of creating this portraiture and sort of centering them in this circular shape,” Hamilton said. “It’s a reminder of sort of a women’s locket.”
This dignity is also visible in paintings like “A Bond of Sisterhood” (2019), where the three women can be seen at night comforting and caring for each other despite the horrors they’ve faced.
“Many of the women, like in particular Anarcha, she experienced at least 30 different surgeries,” Hamilton said. “So, this is a period of time where anesthesia is just starting to be used, but we know for sure he did not use it on these enslaved women and obviously they did not have agency in terms of what they could or could not consent to.”
Arthur also visually illuminates the women with a single light, showing the intimacy and strength they have amongst each other, directly juxtaposing this scene with Sims in the doorway, covered in darkness. Arthur makes Sims and his threatening composure powerless to the women’s depiction of sisterhood and resilience.
This depiction can be seen in how he styles the women in colors that ground the piece and in lace that makes the image come alive, not only breaking the barrier between 2D and 3D, but also between art and reality.
Many 3D pieces are displayed as a part of the exhibit and help bring interactive elements to the gallery. “Victory Beyond Sims” (2022) by Vinnie Bagwell, is an impressive sculpture, which is planned to take the place where J. Marion Sims’s statue once stood in New York’s Central Park, until it was removed in 2017. This new statue, which portrays a Black woman with angel-like wings, features braille, engravings of slave ships, and the names Betsey, Lucy, and Anarcha. The statue holds an eternal flame in one hand and a caduceus, the official insignia of the United States Medical Corps.
Other interactive elements include images from plays and experimental performances. One surprising piece is a video, “Purge” (2017), created by King Cobra (documented as Doreen Lynette Garner), where Black women surround a cast of J. Marion Sims’s statue and perform surgery on it.
This collection of art leaves viewers in absolute awe. Some pieces may cause one to shed a tear and evoke outrage at the cruelty these women faced such as Jules Arthur’s “Field of Exploitation” (2023), which depicts Black babies, as they float in the air surrounding several enslaved women. In particular, “Field of Exploitation” acknowledges the many miscarriages and birth complications Black mothers experience as a result of malnutrition and harsh conditions.
Other pieces like Jules Arthur’s “Legacies of Resilience” (2023) and “Sisterly Resistance” (2019) will empower audiences and evoke pride. These two pieces depict Betsey, Anarcha, and Lucy, as they peer down at other women who advocated for their needs by tearing down J. Marion Sims’s statue or praising the multiple Black women doctors and medical professionals who rose to success in an industry that once harmed them.
Overall, this exhibit holds up the legacies of the many Black women who were experimented on.
“Sims is not exceptional, that he is one of many doctors at this period of time,” Hamilton said. “They are experimenting on lots of Black folks.”
Hamilton also expressed how important this history is as it is “baked into modern contemporary healthcare practice.”
She also shared that, “To this day Black women die at disproportionately higher rates post birth after delivering their children.”
“Black folks have reason to be suspicious of clinicians and hospitals,” Hamilton finished.
Ultimately, this impressive collection is made by artists who are passionate and dedicated to this mission, making this exhibit a must-see.

Sadhugold, an enigmatic rapper-producer based in Philadelphia, is one of the most sought-after beatmakers currently working in the East Coast underground. His choice to remain anonymous, often donning a gold foil mask, has not only added an air of mystery to his persona but also allowed the focus to remain on the music itself. With an impressive roster of collaborators, such as Westside Gunn, Estee Nack, Mach-Hommy, and Tha God Fahim, Sadhugold continues to gain recognition for his creative versatility and undeniable production talent.
Sadhugold developed a deep passion for production beginning in middle school while listening to artists like Juelz Santana and Big Tymers. He has always approached his creative process organically, focusing on the artistic aspect of his work first and foremost. As a result, his beats often take shape before he considers potential collaborations. "Usually the person doesn't come to mind until after they're done, and I'm just like, okay, I can hear so-and-so on this," Sadhugold said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Sadhugold’s decision to wear a mask and maintain anonymity serves multiple purposes, according to the artist. It allows listeners to project their own ideas and interpretations onto his persona, fostering a subjective experience for each listener.
The mask also underscores the fact that Sadhugold does not seek personal fame, instead wanting to keep the spotlight on the music itself. “I reject the idea of fame,” the artist said. “Fame is just a toxic concept, especially for black people. I don't know how acclaimed I will wind up, but in the event it would be nice to be able to go somewhere and not have to say hi to somebody or take a picture.”
This perspective on fame highlights Sadhugold's commitment to the art form and his belief in its power to convey a message. Working with Griselda Records artists such as Westside Gunn and Rome Streetz has allowed Sadhugold to forge relationships based on mutual respect. He describes their collaborative process as dynamic and productive, with Westside Gunn's creative energy often propelling their work forward.
"[Westside Gunn] gets along with everybody,” Sadhugold said. “The guy’s got ADHD in the best way possible because he’s always on the move. He’s always got a new idea, they're always good ideas, and he’s really accommodating."
Sadhugold has contributed his production prowess to several of Westside Gunn’s projects, including 2018’s “Supreme Blientele” and the July 2020 album “Flygod is An Awesome God 2,” which also prominently featured Syracuse rapper Stove God Cooks. Sadhugold showcased his rapping skills on the track "Greatminder" from the latter project. Most recently, Sadhugold collaborated with Rome Streetz on his debut Griselda Records album, “Kiss The Ring,” producing the song “Fashion Rebel” alongside Sovren.
In addition to music production, Sadhugold is a talented visual artist, having taken an interest in drawing since childhood. This skill often extends to his projects, where he creates the accompanying artwork. According to Sadhugold, the intersection of visual art and music has grown increasingly important in his recent work. This approach allows him to explore different avenues of expression, such as reconnecting with his childhood love for classic cartoons like “Popeye the Sailor Man” and “Looney Tunes”.
“I'll see certain cartoons and just the rhythm that old cartoons have, it just has some kind of a hip-hop essence about it, like you can put a beat behind it and it will just be in sync,” Sadhugold said.
Sadhugold’s recent projects include “The Black Mobius” with Lord Jah-Monte Ogbon and “ATTACK OF THE SWINE MERCHANTS” with Philadelphia rapper Spook, both of which were released in the last year. Last week, he released a full length tape with Tha God Fahim called “Dump Gawd: Tha Knocking of Loose.” The artist also teased a re-release of “Surfinongold.wav 2,” his full length tape with Estee Nack and a follow up to their 2018 release, as well as fresh production work with collaborators old and new.
“I’m working with Mickey Diamond. I’m working with Koncept Jack$on. I still got a lot of stuff coming with Mach-Hommy and Your Old Droog, also got more with Spook,” the artist said.
“People can expect a phantasmagoria of content beyond their wildest dreams,” Sadhugold added.

There have been many different approaches to telling the story of Dracula over the years, from the 1931 cult classic “Dracula” starring Bela Lugosi to 1922’s chilling “Nosferatu.” Standing amongst the greats, “Renfield,” the 2023 film from director Chris McKay, is bound to disappoint some moviegoers. The movie attempts to pay homage to the horror genre but the script’s madcap interpretation of Dracula undermines the impressive set design and cinematography. McKay’s other directing credits include “The Lego Batman Movie” and “Robot Chicken,” which might provide context for the offbeat direction he takes his latest release.
“Renfield” stars Nicholas Hoult as Robert Montague Renfield, a young real estate agent that found himself trapped in pursuit of a deal with Count Dracula. The Prince of Darkness is played by none other than Nicholas Cage, funnily landing himself in his second vampire movie. The overall plotline of the story is poorly developed, but the movie’s visual aspects supply audiences with some semblance of continuity between overlapping storylines.
The background to the story is that Renfield is gifted special abilities and immortality on the condition that he caters to Dracula’s every need. The emotional impact of finding humans for Dracula to consume is the focus, a continuation of the central theme in Tod Browning’s “Dracula.” The pair take on modern-day America, where Renfield joins a “Dependent Relationship Anonymous Addiction Group” that forces him to face his codependent habits. Cinematographer Mitchell Amundsen, also known for his work on “Transformers” and “Odd Thomas,” masterfully contrasts the sterile bluish-green setting of the church where Renfield attends group therapy with the red hues of the dimly-lit abandoned hospital Dracula occupies.
The clever use of cinematography continues making strides at establishing the film’s exaggeratedly silly horror as Renfield progresses in his self-help journey and meets a young scrappy traffic cop named Rebecca, played by Awkwafina. The pair fight off the mother and son local crime lord duo Teddy and Bella-Francesca Lobo, played by Shohreh Aghdashloo and Ben Schwartz. These face-offs are sprinkled throughout the film, containing action shots which completely defy the laws of physics. In a bar fight scene, Renfield manages to completely sever the arms of an assailant using only a decorative platter and pure strength, in an excessive attempt at returning the movie’s focus to horror.
Where the actors’ jokes fall flat and the dialogue borders on predictability, the set design picks up the slack. The color palette and decoration of Renfield’s studio apartment, rented without his master’s approval, appear to be taken straight from a spring edition home decor magazine. The walls are littered with motivational posters and the energy feels almost ridiculously joyful considering the gory fight scenes the characters experienced just moments prior.
The various visual elements within “Renfield” reflect expert design and thought, but the film’s scattered story which bounces between wise cracks and over-the-top action has the potential to leave audiences feeling disheartened at best. Rather than trying to fit within the genres of horror, comedy, and action, perhaps “Renfield”' would have been better off sticking to just one.

A debut novel is always an exciting moment. In the absence of a reputation to precede them, a debut author can release something utterly unexpected. With this luxury at hand, Jinwoo Chong has crafted in “Flux” a genre-defying story that will confound, for better or worse, even the most experienced readers.
At the heart of “Flux” is Brandon, a 28-year-old Korean-American whose story starts when he — quite unfortunately — falls down an elevator shaft. Only a short while later, he has begun a new job at the glamorous, accelerating, and not-the-least-bit mysterious energy company Flux. Over the course of the novel, Brandon finds that his new role is not what he expected it to be. Meanwhile, alongside two other central but less salient characters, Brandon copes both with the acute trauma of his past and with his own identity in the present.
One of the strongest elements of “Flux” is its refusal to conform to literary norms. At no point in reading this novel is it possible to categorize it in a single genre. Although the book’s amorphism can be confusing at times, the novel would not function without it.
The book’s different inspirations and elements combine to make Brandon a uniquely realistic protagonist. At once he is funny, unlikeable, relatable, hopeful — and he can, at times, command a tremendous deal of pity.
Chong’s combination of these hyperrealistic character elements with the novel’s timeliness make its science fiction basis all the more impressive. For example, Flux’s founder, Io Emsworth, is instantly recognizable as a fictionalized version of Elizabeth Holmes. Other references point to popular media such as “Indiana Jones.” On a macro level, subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) discussions about energy, sustainability, and inequality in a not-so-far-off science fiction future will lead readers to ponder what time period they are actually reading about.
This merging of the present and future often compounds the already disorienting narrative. Throughout much of the novel, quick chapter breaks, perspective shifts, and skips in time create a dizzying reading experience. Moreover, Chong deftly creates a claustrophobic aura, making “Flux” both highly nauseating and wonderfully realistic at the same time.
However, in the middle third of the novel, the novel’s plot and characters unravel methodically yet slowly. Amidst the novel’s already-confusing daze, this is likely where most readers will put the book down. During this section of the novel, “Flux” succeeds by leaning more heavily into its humanistic plot elements of ethnicity, sexuality, and family — but the novel’s strongest moments are when these components merge with its science fiction core.
Overall, “Flux” is a debut novel that is pleasantly surprising at every turn. Never trying to push too hard in any literary direction other than its own, the novel is a breath of fresh air. As with any uncharted endeavor, it suffers several hiccups throughout, particularly regarding its intentionally confusing storytelling. Still, “Flux” is ultimately a unique and fulfilling story bolstered by its myriad applications to its readers’ comparatively mundane lives.

The singsong hum of prayers was dominated by one person’s voice — a voice carrying a Yiddish accent of a bygone era, a voice steeped in the Old World Jewish communities known as shtetls, a voice that exuded the type of confidence only found among the old and wise.
That man’s name was Morton Friedman, and he had been proudly reciting those prayers for decades, even after he saw his community nearly entirely wiped off the map of Europe during the Holocaust.
I was lucky because I got to know him between prayer services a decade ago.
“Yankel,” he would say, using the Yiddish version of my name, “how are you doing today?” In the conversations that followed, he would share stories about surviving the concentration camps and seeking refuge aboard the S.S. Exodus along with thousands of other Jewish Holocaust survivors.
But as survivors of the Holocaust grow older and die, fewer and fewer people have the opportunity to learn about its atrocities firsthand. Because of this, public knowledge about the Holocaust is in serious jeopardy. Less than half of respondents in one recent survey of Americans knew how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust, or that Adolf Hitler came to power through a democratic process.
Holocaust denial is also on the rise: An estimated 19 percent of Twitter content on the topic distorts the truth or denies the events outright. In the Netherlands — the former home of Anne Frank, whose diary chronicles her persecution during the Holocaust — a recent survey found that 23 percent of adults under age 40 believe the Holocaust is a myth or exaggerated.
Perhaps as a result of these distorted retellings of history, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. are surging. Last month, the FBI reported a 20 percent increase in violent crimes targeting Jews from 2020 to 2021. According to the American Jewish Committee’s 2021 annual survey, nearly 40 percent of American Jews have reported changing their behavior in fear of being victimized, a trend that makes sense given the multiple recent mass shootings targeting the Jewish community.
Meanwhile, over the past few years, several public figures have used language easily construed as antisemitic. From former President Donald J. Trump’s comments arguing that Jews who vote against him are disloyal to statements from Democratic Representative Ilhan A. Omar that both Republicans and Democrats criticized for playing into antisemitic tropes (although she did later apologize), politicians on both sides of the aisle have played a part in cultivating an antisemitic climate. Other celebrities contribute as well — like Kanye West, who notoriously tweeted that he would “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” even while claiming that he “actually can’t be Anti Semitic.”
Antisemitism is not the only kind of hate that increases when we forget the Holocaust. A primary lesson of the Holocaust was how easily society can slip into an authoritarian and genocidal state. Before the Nazis took over, Germany was a promising democratic republic and a center of arts and culture. Remembering the Holocaust can help us recognize history repeating itself — including, scarily, the mass genocides that are still taking place today.
Growing up, the Holocaust was just a fact of my life, and thinking about it was like thinking about my parents' childhood — nothing in my community would make sense without it. The oft-repeated mantra “never forget” seemed so inane that it bordered on meaningless. After all, how could one possibly forget such an atrocity?
Today, that rallying cry no longer appears so trivial.
In 2020, Morton Friedman died. He can no longer share his story with others. Slowly, recollection of the Holocaust is passing from eyewitness stories to the domain of history textbooks. The challenge our generation faces is establishing how we can “never forget” when those with lived memory are nowhere to be found.
One truth is obvious: In order to never forget, we must always remember.
On an intellectual level, remembering is easy — a history textbook is a sufficient resource for those seeking to understand exactly what transpired. But sometimes it takes more extreme measures to truly comprehend the Holocaust.
The concentration camps where Jews were forced to do hard labor, and then brutally murdered and cremated in mass ovens, are kept in their original condition so that visitors can be impressed by the stunning cruelty of the Nazi regime. Film and literature produced by victims, as well, can provide a visceral perspective. And this potential for a visceral connection was why we — Harvard Hillel — brought a replica of a Nazi cattle car into Harvard Yard.
It is true that films and artifacts are disturbing — but that is precisely the point. The memory of atrocity fades when it is reduced to descriptions or images. Sometimes it takes seeing an actual object, or watching a vivid account, to experience the revulsion that the memory of the Holocaust should evoke.
While taking a class about the Holocaust is educational, seeing a cattle car where Jews were packed like sardines, and transported for days without food or water and only a bucket for excrement, is unforgettable. Touring a concentration camp where Jews were brutally suffocated in specially built gas chambers is very different from reading the number six million.
Those of us who have heard survivors share their experiences aren’t likely to forget the terrors of the Holocaust soon. But our societal memory is flickering, and we are feeling its result. Antisemitism, and hate writ large, can only be combated properly when we remember the past.
I will miss talking with Morton Friedman, but I will carry his memories with me. I hope you will too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve taken eight academic classes this year. Every single one of them was taught by a white professor.
And I don’t think that’s uncommon. For an institution that claims to focus on diversity, Harvard’s faculty is quite racially homogeneous — just 22 percent of tenured faculty are non-white, and less than 10 percent are Black, Hispanic or Latinx, or Native American. While that is far more diverse than Harvard around two decades ago, it is still woefully unrepresentative of the Harvard student body and the larger United States population.
Sadly, the rest of academia isn’t much better. While universities have successfully increased student diversity, faculty diversity has failed to keep pace. Indeed, in 2020, faculty of color at U.S. degree-granting postsecondary institutions comprised just 26 percent of all full-time faculty, even as students of color made up 46 percent of the total student population.
These abysmal statistics signal that higher education institutions must do more to radically reshape their recruitment and hiring strategies. On its current track, Ivy League faculty will never achieve demographic parity with the U.S. population.
Faculty diversity isn’t just about checking the representational box; it’s essential to the mission of higher education. A racially diverse faculty is critical for both students of color and white students to receive a better education.
One study suggests that faculty diversity positively affects overall graduation rates for students of color. Another concludes that Black students enrolled in STEM courses taught by Black instructors are more likely to remain in a STEM field after a year.
This is not at all surprising. A more diverse faculty provides students of color with role models who share their racial or ethnic background. These students then feel a stronger sense of belonging and validation, which contributes to their academic growth and success.
Studies find that white students, too, demonstrate better critical thinking skills and report improved overall satisfaction when taught by diverse faculty.
So what can institutions do to ensure diverse, representational faculty?
Most obviously, universities should take steps to eliminate racial bias throughout the hiring process for Ph.D. students or postdoctoral researchers. Search committees should employ equity advocates — committee members that promote fair and inclusive evaluation of all candidates — to standardize the interview process and provide an extra layer of accountability.
Universities can also embrace “cluster hiring”: appointing multiple faculty at once across a range of related fields, rather than hiring them one by one. Recruiting a larger group of scholars increases the likelihood of a diverse pool of applicants and can mitigate the isolation often felt by singular faculty from underrepresented demographics.
But hiring is only the shallowest level of the problem. Universities shouldn’t achieve diversity goals just by poaching a limited number of faculty of color from peer institutions — that won’t increase the total number of faculty from underrepresented demographics.
The deeper problem is that the pipeline to professorship is plagued with racial prejudice. Horror stories from Black doctoral students and faculty dissuade Black college graduates from pursuing higher degrees in the first place out of concerns that these programs will treat them poorly.
In addition, many students of color lack the support needed to inspire them to pursue a career as faculty. One recent study found that students who have parents with Ph.D.s are far more likely to become faculty members, in part because they are more likely to receive encouragement for careers in academia from their parents. This finding is problematic given that Black and Hispanic adults are far less likely to hold graduate degrees than white adults.
As a result, higher education appears to be locked in a vicious cycle: Students of color have less access to support and mentorship, leading to less faculty diversity, which in turn makes it harder for students from underrepresented communities to envision themselves in faculty positions.
Universities need to start breaking this cycle — now.
Underrepresented students should be supported at every step on the path to professorship. Universities can partner with programs specifically designed to prepare underrepresented students for doctoral study, like the McNair Scholars Program and the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate. They can also focus on hiring doctoral students from historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions that primarily serve underrepresented groups.
Next, universities should pair underrepresented graduate students with faculty mentors, who will help demystify the job search and replace a competitive environment with a supportive one. Mentorship programs can also help build trust among underrepresented students in demonstrating universities’ commitments to closing equity gaps.
Ultimately, breaking down racial barriers requires a multi-pronged support system that begins when students of color first set foot on university campuses. Intervention strategies need to focus both on building the talent pool of underrepresented applicants and ensuring equitable hiring of those applicants. Otherwise, the ivory towers of academia will remain both exclusionary and far too white.

From The Harvard Crimson’s Fifteen Minutes Magazine, writers Jem K. Williams and Maya M. F. Wilson take a closer look at the public image of the Unabomber. The serial bomber, caught in the 1990s, continues to remain a fixture in the imaginations of countless podcast hosts, documentary makers, and journalists — why? As they break down the common stories used to explain his path to violence and examine the aftershocks of the publication of his manifesto, they’ll explore the dark spaces of the internet, the true crime industry, and the responsibility of the media as a whole.
“What do you get when you mix Harvard, homemade bombs, and a deep-seated fear of technological advancement?” In this episode, JKW and MMFW introduce Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. They ask why, several decades later, we still talk about him. More importantly, they ask how we can talk about him responsibly and with integrity.
See the episode page here.
In this episode, JKW and MMFW start from the beginning talking to Ted’s brother, David, and his neighbor, Jamie Gehring, to dive into the Unabomber’s many “origin stories.” Some point to his participation in a psychological study at Harvard as the reason for his crimes — some point earlier, to when he was hospitalized at just nine months old. Some point to his fraught relationship with his gender. To this, Eric Benson, host of the “Project Unabomb” podcast says: “You want to find the reason that this really bad thing happened. And to me, it is ultimately kind of unknowable.”
See the episode page here.
In Sept. 1995, Ted Kaczynski published his manifesto in the Washington Post. JKW and MMFW talk to Donald Graham, the publisher of the Post at the time, to learn about how the Post came to its decision to publish the Manifesto. They interview Jake Hanrahan, terrorism journalist, about how the Manifesto has been adopted and adapted by far-right extremists and trolls.
See the episode page here.
In this episode, JKW and MMFW interview extremist experts Graham Macklin and Joshua Farrell-Molloy to talk about how the Unabomber has captured the attention of eco-fascists. They speak with Mick Grogan, producer of a Netflix documentary about the Unabomber, to understand how Ted has also captured media attention. Gehring discusses the mechanics of the true crime industry. Bryan Denson, who wrote a book about the Unabomber, speculates on the characteristics that create public intrigue around Ted, even now.
See the episode page here.
What is the role of the media in all of this? That is, what is our role? MMFW and JKW finish up the series by talking about the benefits and the harms of Ted’s media coverage, and they reflect on how we force narratives unto people, and how the real stories will inevitably elude us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael B. Alexander ’73 and Elsa M. Núñez were named 2023-24 presidents-in-residence at the Harvard Graduate School of Education April 4, when the program was also renamed in honor of HGSE senior lecturer and program founder Judith Block McLaughlin.
Presidents-in-residence at HGSE assist the instruction of higher education courses and meet with and advise students in weekly office hours. Former presidents-in-residence include Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow and retired presidents from institutions including Bridgewater State University, Morehouse College, Northeastern University, and Wellesley College.
Alexander — who previously served as assistant dean of freshmen at Harvard College and who will step down from his current role as president of Lasell University on June 30 — said he hopes to impart lessons about the collaborative nature of a university presidency on HGSE students.
“You have to deal with everything, and raise money, and hire good people, and keep them motivated,” Alexander said. “You have to be willing to prepare and support the people you work with to be successful, to use their skills and experiences to the best of their ability, which means allowing them to make their own decisions.”
Núñez, who is the president of Eastern Connecticut State University, said she will bring to HGSE her experience working with a diverse faculty and student body.
“Harvard is giving voice to people from modest backgrounds with my appointment. In other words, they’re saying, ‘We want to hear from leaders who have led institutions where there is a large percentage of faculty of color, of students of color, and people from modest backgrounds,’” Núñez said.
She also said she hopes to share her candid experiences as a university administrator with HGSE students.
“People usually laugh when I say, ‘The best way you can learn is through my mistakes,’” Núñez said.
This reflection on mistakes is exactly the style of mentorship the presidents-in-residence program aims to provide, according to McLaughlin, who will retire from HGSE this year.
“In the end, the criteria for choosing someone was that they had been successful in their careers, but they would also be candid about the mistakes they made,” McLaughlin said of the presidents-in-residence selection process.
McLaughlin said she founded the program to provide former presidents with a transitional opportunity to share the knowledge they acquired throughout their careers.
“You have all this expertise that you’ve developed over time, but there’s no place in which to convey it. It’s not appropriate for you to be a personage on your former campus — that’s the role of the new president. And yet you really are an expert, and this expertise in some senses goes untapped,” she said.
McLaughlin added she believes the role of a university president is particularly challenging today because of the controversy surrounding higher education.
“The public criticism of higher education, particularly now, is intense,” she said. “Critical thinking, diversity, equity, inclusion, even truth and facts, sort of foundational values for higher education are under attack.”
McLaughlin also said she feels hopeful for future generations of higher education leadership.
“I’m heartened by the fact that, despite the difficulty of the job, there are people who choose to enter it and who really commit themselves to it in very, very important ways — give their energy, their hopes, their hearts to it,” McLaughlin added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Ramadan came to a close Friday, many of Harvard’s Muslim students criticized the College’s religious accommodations policy, citing challenges including a lack of adequate prayer facilities, poor accessibility, and insufficient dining options.
Ramadan, which began this year on March 22, is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and a holy month of fasting.
Mohamed Salam Moumie Ntieche ’26 said that though he “looks at his presence here at Harvard as a privilege” and appreciates what the College has done so far to support Muslim students, it could do more to provide adequate prayer facilities.
“People within the community are trying their best, but definitely, as a member of the Muslim community, I’ll say that I believe that the University is not doing as much as it should,” he said.
“We meet every Friday in the Lowell Lecture Hall to pray. The entire Muslim community meets in that hall, which is a big hall according to Harvard, but it’s not a big enough hall to accommodate,” he added.
Sameer M. Khan ’24 said he faced difficulties in obtaining proper accommodations for observing Ramadan during his weekly evening chemistry lab last year.
Despite his early communication with the course staff, Khan struggled to find a solution that allowed him to break his fast and engage spiritually with the holiday.
“I identified this issue really early on, actually, and I think I was in contact with the course staff starting in January of that year,” Khan said.
In response to Khan’s requests for accommodations during Ramadan, the course staff initially provided a limited solution — granting Khan a 20-minute break during the lab session to step into another room to eat and pray — but Khan said this option was insufficient.
“The accommodations created this construction of Ramadan that was solely based around this idea of breaking my fast, and being able to take that first bite and then that first sip of water, and then just go back into lab, which to me is not the experience that I’ve had with Ramadan entirely throughout my life,” Khan said.
Students also expressed their dissatisfaction with dining services, the accessibility of halal food options, and the prevalence of alcohol — whose consumption is prohibited in Islam — as an ingredient in a variety of menu options.
“I would just go and pick the desserts, and well, I didn’t think twice,” Moumie Ntieche said, noting his shock when he learned that alcohol was commonly used in these desserts. “Why is it that they are putting alcohol in something like this? Literally anyone can have — should have — access to this.”
In an emailed statement, College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo pointed to Harvard’s existing religious accommodations, noting that the University abides by a Massachusetts law requiring classes to excuse a student without penalty who is unable “because of his religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement.”
“HUDS has worked in close coordination with the Muslim Chaplains and students in the Islamic Society for the last two years to significantly advance support for students who eat Halal and to provide services during Ramadan,” Palumbo said. “HUDS is continually focused on diverse and inclusive service and menus to support our students.”
Hana Rehman ’25, a Crimson Blog chair, said that practicing religious students on campus are not asking for “something extreme or extravagant” from the College to feel supported.
“The easiest solution is just making sure that professors, faculties, and course heads know that this event is happening and letting students know ahead of time that they’re allowed to take extensions without the students having to advocate for themselves all the time and having to explain themselves, their religious holidays, and their events,” Rehman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Newly admitted students did not let rain showers dampen their spirits for Harvard College’s Visitas weekend.
Current students opened their doors to prospective members of the Class of 2027 during the two-day event, the second in-person Visitas after two years of virtual programming. 
Prospective enrollees could attend an academic fair, an extracurricular fair, a campus jogging tour, and mixers with several student organizations. Admitted students also attended classes with current students and faculty on Monday.
Rush X. Bogin, an admitted student from Colorado interested in Economics and theater, said he reached out to other admitted students prior to Visitas on Crimson Connect, a platform where incoming students can talk with other incoming and current students about life at Harvard.
“I’ve met some people previously, but then showing up just at the check in, everybody’s been super friendly,” he said. “I’ve met like 50 people.”
E. Elson Bankoff, who plans to study Government and Environmental Science and Public Policy, said she has been connecting with other admitted students through social media.
“I already made a group of Bojack Horseman fans, like a little group chat and stuff. So I’ve been in touch with a lot of people,” Bankoff said.
Gabrielle M. Greene, a prospective enrollee who is interested in Government and Theater, Dance and Media, said she often found herself talking to people who had impressive achievements.
“You’re talking to someone and you’re having a normal conversation with them, and then you find out they’ve done some amazing thing that changed the world,” Greene said.
Similarly, prospective student Amelie S. Liu, who wants to study Economics and Government with a citation in Mandarin, said people were “very down to earth” despite having “done such amazing things.”
“Having a community of peers who are not only supportive, but push me to achieve is going to be really great. So I’m very excited about that,” Liu said.
Admitted students are also excited to join extracurricular and affinity groups in the fall. Greene has been in contact with groups like the Black Students Association, Generational African American Students Association, and Harvard Christian Impact.
“They’re really integral in helping me get acclimated to campus life and learning more about the College,” Greene said.
Bogin said he was excited to join theater groups like Hasty Pudding Theatricals, adding he thought it was “so cool” that the organization recently honored Jennifer Coolidge as its Woman of the Year.
Bankoff said the College’s location was a draw for her in applying.
“I think something I was looking forward to college is proximity to a city, but also kind of that small town feel, which is exactly what Harvard is,” Bankoff said. “And it has a kind of old-fashioned feel to it.”
Greene also said that the weather “seemed gloomy” but that she liked the College’s architecture.
“I really liked the historical aspect of it. All of the buildings seem like they have some sort of special connection to campus,” Greene added.
Juliet Bu, an admit from New Jersey who wants to study Economics and Government, said her favorite Visitas experience was visiting Government 1280: “Government and Politics of China.”
“It was a really nice snapshot of what a day in the life of a class at Harvard looks like,” Bu said.
Bu added that professors helped create a “really welcoming” environment that admits wouldn’t be able to experience otherwise.
“I think interacting with professors is really the best part, because you hear how passionate they are about things, like how willing they are to engage with you even though you’re literally a prefrosh,” Bu said.
Students admitted to the Class of 2027 have until May 1 to respond to their letter of admission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow agreed on Friday to meet with a group of Black student leaders after Harvard University Police Department officers earlier this month ordered four Black undergraduates out of their rooms at gunpoint while responding to a false 911 call in a “swatting” attack.
Dozens of student organizations co-signed an open letter of demands to top Harvard officials last week calling on the University to release a statement addressing the April 3 attack, which took place in Leverett House, an undergraduate dormitory. At least five HUPD officers armed with assault rifles and riot gear raided the suite at around 4:15 a.m., instructing the students to exit their rooms with their hands raised.
In addition to other complaints, the letter criticized administrators for waiting more than 60 hours before first issuing a statement about the attack, calling the silence “a failure in leadership.”
According to the letter, members of co-signatory organizations planned to stage a demonstration during Visitas — the College’s admitted students weekend, which took place from April 23–24 — if the University did not respond to the letter’s demands by the first day of Visitas.
Black Students Association President Angie Gabeau ’25 confirmed Monday that Bacow responded to the letter and agreed to meet with a group of student representatives.
“The University has gotten back to us,” said Gabeau, a Crimson Editorial editor. “They requested to have a meeting with five individuals who would represent the collective of people who wrote and co-signed this letter. We’re currently reaching back out to them, to give them the names of people that we want to see in the meeting.”
Black Community Leaders Co-Chair Brian A. Cromwell Jr. ’23 — who helped draft the original letter — and Black Graduate Student Alliance President Ebony Joy Johnson wrote in an emailed statement that the response came from Bacow’s chief of staff, Patricia S. “Patti” Bellinger ’83.
A date has not yet been set for the meeting, according to the statement.
Cromwell and Johnson wrote that the groups responded to Bellinger’s email Monday morning, specifically requesting that President-elect Claudine Gay be present at the meeting “because Bacow will be leaving the university shortly.”
“As the incoming university president, we believe Gay should be present if there is any chance of future progress regarding the systemic issues on our campus,” the statement reads.
The open letter signed by the student organizations also requested a town hall meeting with Bacow, Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to “discuss Harvard’s handling of issues of racial policing and HUPD protocol.”
In an interview Monday, Bacow defended his decision to not release a University-wide statement about the swatting attack, saying that he decided to remain silent in part because “there were already many people who had spoken out,” including HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay and Khurana.
“I thought adding my voice again would not contribute much in part because everything that I would have said all had already been said by them,” Bacow said.
Bacow also refuted the idea that there was not an immediate response from the University, pointing to HUPD’s response to the swatting call and internal Leverett communications.
“There was an immediate response to the students — literally immediate — by the police who entered the room to explain why they were there,” he said. “There was a response from the faculty deans, there was a response to the house by the College.”
“So it’s not as if there was no response immediately,” he added.
Bacow said another, “more important” consideration behind the University’s response was to prevent the perpetrator of the attack from receiving more attention, advice the University received from federal authorities and other institutions that have been “subject to similar kinds of incidents.”
“What they’re seeking more than anything else is publicity. They are seeking to terrorize an entire community,” Bacow said. “If I speak it only gives the perpetrator of this crime more of what they seek.”
“We’re a big, fat target,” he added. “If people think that they can get the president to respond to anything, any act of provocation, it will only encourage more of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a seven-game series where it pulled out four wins, and after losing in overtime to Brown at a score of 12-11, Harvard women’s water polo will take its talent next to the CWPA Championships.
Before its game against Brown, with the Michigan matches as bookends, Harvard went up against No. 7 Princeton and No. 14 Michigan, losing to both teams in Blodgett Pool before defeating both Bucknell University and Saint Francis University with scores of 18-9 and 18-8, respectively.
Its loss to Michigan in the morning resulted in a vengeful comeback for the Crimson’s Senior Day match against Bucknell that night.
The Crimson was down 4-3 following the first quarter before the Wolverines pulled away at the half, stretching the distance between scores to 7-5 and ultimately winning the game with a score of 14-6. Harvard had six different players find the back of the net, with first-year Ruby Hodge from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., adding to her impressive stats.
When asked about her success during the game, Hodge said, “After taking a tough loss against Michigan for our senior weekend, our team was able to turn around our mindset completely. Of course, it was a hard game to lose, but we have been focusing on appreciating our team and experiences more than our wins.”
“This senior weekend really forced us to look at the bigger picture of the season outside of winning, which is the love for our team, teammates, and coaches,” she added.
Following its loss to Michigan, the Crimson came back stronger than ever that afternoon for its Senior Game, refining both its offense and defense. Senior captain Zoe Banks of Palo Alto, Calif. made ten saves alongside ten of the 19 goals being scored by seniors.
Both sophomore Erin Kim and first-year Heidi Heffelfinger hit two goals each. Juniors Annabelle Bisconti, Annabel Facey, Josie Mobley, and sophomore Kaity Greenwald each found the back of the net.
Hodge continued her hot streak with two assists, following in senior Brooke Hourigan’s footsteps who also had four steals.
“We have learned that we may lose some games we have worked incredibly hard for, but each loss has pushed us to grow together as a team,” Hodge said. “Overall, the senior weekend reminded us to appreciate each other and enjoy playing with this talented senior class for their last year. We came out on our senior day game just to play for fun and together.”
In the end, the Crimson left 19 goals in the pool. Fresh off its vengeful victory, Harvard carried this momentum into the following day in its game against Saint Francis University where, for the fourth time this season, the team scored more than 20 goals. Leading the charge was sophomore Dany Zapata who made the 20th goal of the game. Hourigan also had a hat trick, including two goals on penalty shots.
“I think we’re doing really well with our defense in these games and although communication is always something we’re trying to improve, we’ve definitely taken strides on our communication since the beginning of the year,” Zapata said.
“SFU was the last game we got to play before going up against our rivals Michigan on Sunday, so we wanted to use the SFU game to prepare ourselves for the even more physical Michigan team,” she continued. “Earlier that day against Bucknell, we got our 20th win of the season, which is an awesome achievement to get as a team, especially for our seniors who are going to be playing their last games of water polo over the next two weeks.”
In its last home game of the season against No. 7 Princeton, senior captain Grace Thawley’s second goal of the game, with 18 seconds left on the clock, pushed the game into overtime, encouraging a Crimson comeback late in the fourth quarter.
Even with Hodge’s hat trick and Bank’s eleven saves, following her recent honor of being on the Cutino Award Watch List, the Crimson was unable to keep the Tigers at bay.
“Our game against Princeton last weekend was a really big step forward from our initial matchup earlier this Spring. The team really had one another’s back through the whole game, and we didn’t let the ups and downs ever get to us in a way that would make it hard to bounce back,” Thawley reflected.
“The grit we showed was really inspiring — the strong mentality of my team is what put us in a place to succeed in that game,” she continued. “While it didn’t all go our way, many things did — we needed that confidence boost.”
History repeated itself when the Crimson faced off against Bucknell, Saint Francis University, and Michigan again the following weekend.
In both its games against Bucknell and Saint Francis, Harvard held strong with eighteen points in each game. In its second doubleheader, increased its record to 21-7, starting strong in the match against the Bisons with junior Sasha Constandse netting her first four-goal game of the season. Senior captains Thawley and Banks were crucial additions to the mix, with Thawley adding another hat-trick in the victory and Banks making five saves.
The Saint Francis’s match had its fair share of impressive stats, with seven separate Crimson members scoring their own pairs of goals. With scores and spirits high, the Crimson fought hard against the Wolverines but ultimately lost 15-8.
“We have now started to come together in a tight huddle [where] our coach will give a little speech, [and] we will end with a strong cheer saying ‘family’ or ‘together’, and then we will go out as a team to finish the game,” Hodge said. “Sometimes, it does not always go our way, like the Princeton game, but we were proud of our team for never giving up and fighting till the end.”
Going into this upcoming weekend against Brown, Zapata said “We’re really excited to play Brown this weekend — this is our last match before conference championships at Princeton and will determine if we go into conference ranked [as the] third or fourth seed, so it’s a very critical game.”
“We are putting the finishing touches on our offensive and defensive strategies, and making sure we’re in the best possible place going into these last 2 weeks of games,” the Colombia native added.
Brown has had a similar playing history to the Crimson, winning both games against Bucknell and Saint Francis but succumbing to Princeton and Michigan. This upcoming Saturday, the two Ivy rivals will face off in Bear territory, marking the last games of both teams’ regular seasons.

The new Starbucks and Faro Café? Love them, but that’s old news. Blank Street, a New York based chain known for its clean aesthetic, efficiency, and its fern-green trademark color, will settle conveniently to the left of the Smith Center, providing easy access to a pick-me up. Flyby interviewed co-founder Vinay Menda to learn more about the chain and what Harvard students can expect of this new coffee shop. You’re welcome.
EKR: Could you introduce yourself and describe your path to founding Blank Street?
VM: I moved to New York in 2011 to go to undergrad at NYU. My co-founder was at Columbia; we became friends through the New York international student ecosystem. He’s Lebanese, grew up in London, I’m Indian and grew up in Dubai. We started working together in college, investing small amounts of money into consumer tech companies and started a tiny venture capital business at school. We graduated in 2015 and formalized that into a company called Reshape, where we invested in some incredible companies like Postmates, Sweetgreen, and Reddit. We did that for a while, but always wanted to operate and build a business in the intersection of the digital world and the real world.
My co-founder was obsessed with coffee — I was obsessed with consumer retail. The idea for Blank Street came to us in late 2019 after a bunch of research on the market and the future of the industry. So we decided to jump right in. We quit our investing jobs and, and started building Blank Street in May 2020, and we launched our first store in August 2020.
EKR: What differentiates Blank Street from the other coffee shops out there?
VM: If you look at the coffee landscape in Western Europe and in the U.S., it’s still dominated by, at least in the at-home category, by old school brands; second-wave coffee, and speciality coffee, which is the coffee graded above an 85 at the source, is generally sourced at higher altitudes and is very fragmented. It’s really expensive in terms of price umbrella and it's not as convenient as second-wave coffee. So, the big opportunity we saw, and the core value proposition is: can we take high-quality coffee, the same quality coffee you get at any specialty brand, but make it as convenient and as affordable? And to truly make it a daily routine to compete with the legacy brands, like the Starbucks and in Boston, the Dunkins of the world.
For non-coffee connoisseurs, second-wave coffee consists of places like Starbucks that emphasize coffee origin and communicate the high quality of their coffee, but mainly derive sales from the cafe experience. 
ER: I’ve heard that Blank Street is all about efficiency, is that correct?
VM: Efficiency is important to the customer experience. I think customers don’t want to wait in line for 15 minutes to get their food or beverage. The reason people like waiting in line in markets like New York is because they want to get out of the office, they want to have a break from their day. But, I don’t think the experience of waiting for 15 minutes is the right experience. You want to get what you want very quickly and have 10, 15 minutes for yourself to do what you want versus being stuck in line. So, efficiency is very important. It’s more so just making the lives of our baristas as easy as possible so you can focus on the customer experience versus having to make 15-step drinks that they do at Starbucks.
It sounds like when you’re running to your 9 a.m. at 9:05 a.m., Blank Street’s got you covered. 
EKR: Why did Blank Street open a location in Harvard Square?
VM: A few reasons. First of all, my chief of staff went to Harvard. When he joined the company, he was like, “I don’t care. I need a store at Harvard Square.” So that was one thing. Boston is a market that we really love for coffee, given the history of coffee; the cappuccino was invented there, and Dunkin’ has an incredible presence in Boston. In general, we do better in residential neighborhoods over commercial neighborhoods. The second is that universities and college campuses drink a lot of coffee. We do very well at NYU with younger generations and younger cohorts. So, given how busy people are in college and how they drink coffee 24 hours a day, it was important to have a location on campus.
EKR: I was about to say, we definitely consume a lot of coffee here at Harvard.
VM: I think Harvard might beat NYU. Maybe.
I think we’ll give NYU a run for their money.
EKR: What do Harvard students have to look forward to with this new Blank Street location?
VM: Harvard is known for a lot of legacy coffee chains, like Starbucks that is really big there. You also have some incredible cafes, like Bluestone Lane, that cater to a different type of customer, which is more of a sit down cafe. I think getting the quality you get from the brands you love, with the efficiency you get at a Starbucks is something you should definitely look forward to.
EKR: What do you recommend Harvard Students order from Blank Street, and what’s your personal go-to Blank Street order?
VM: If you can’t tell, I’m wearing a t-shirt that says “Mike’s Hot Honey” on it. One of our drinks is a Mike’s Hot Honey latte, so we add spicy honey to the latte. I love that one. I’m a crazy person — I drink cold brew all year round, and we have a Candy Cane Cold Brew that’s pretty incredible. It tastes like peppermint. Our signature drink in the UK, which is now on the menu here as well, is a Pistachio Latte. So our, our brand color is, what can we call it? Is it Fern Green? Is it Pistachio Green? It’s some type of green that looks like that Pistachio latte. I think that’s gonna be great as well.
During September move-in, I will personally be making Blank Street my first stop and trying the pistachio latte. Staying on campus this summer? You’ll be around for the opening :)
