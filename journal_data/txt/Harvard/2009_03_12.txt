After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perched atop Dr. Manhattan’s Martian crystalline palace, “Watchmen” hero Laurie Jupiter gazes deeply into his white eyes. She pleads desperately for him to prevent the Earth’s impending nuclear destruction but Manhattan continues to stoically admire the surrounding landscape. His reticence is motivated by the saddening knowledge that the beauty of the universe is independent of human existence. This philosophical scene in the 2009 film adaptation of Alan Moore’s 1980s graphic novel—bereft of flashy slow motion action or stereotypical “KA-POW” heroics—seems at odds with the standard notion of the comic book as a simple diversion for children, and it has set a higher standard since its creation, which other comics artists and writers have sought to emulate.  Driven by the philosophical influence of “Watchmen,” the past few decades have witnessed a dramatic shift in comic books, from childhood escapism to serious art, a development noted by fans and scholars alike. Though some professors have introduced the medium in the classroom, the graphic novel has still not been fully integrated into the Harvard curriculum.   FROM PAGE TO SCREENAs the quality of comic books has improved, there has been a proliferation of film adaptations, the most recent of which is “Watchmen.” Many of these films have been box office hits, with movies such as “The Dark Knight” grossing over $1 billion worldwide.  But such movies have also received widespread critical acclaim. The late Heath Ledger, for example, won Best Supporting Actor at the 2009 Academy Awards for his portrayal of the comic book villain “The Joker.” “I think that more and more comic books are catering to the movie industry,” says Billy Tan, a Marvel comic book artist and guest speaker at last Sunday’s Boston Comic Book and Toy Collector’s Spectacular.  “Comic books are becoming and more and more popular.” Over 40 comic books have been adapted to film over the past 10 years, many grossing as much as $100 million. Developments in computer technology have made it possible for improved visual effects to convincingly translate fantastic images from the comic page to the silver screen. In “Watchmen,” director Zack Snyder employs a speed-ramping technique to place emphasis on dynamic moments in his action sequences, inviting the viewer to study the image in much the same way one would pause to appreciate a single comic panel. Moreover, Snyder endeavored to ensure that “Watchmen” maintained an aesthetic similar to that of the comic by working closely with Dave Gibbons who illustrated the 1986-87 novel.  “In a lot of ways Dave is like the visual author of the movie,” Snyder says. “If you think about the movie as a normal book, Dave becomes in some ways like the imagination of the reader. I think that that is an amazing gift that he gives the movie, because the movie is not only the texture of what Alan wrote, but it’s also the mood that’s set by the drawings of Dave Gibbons.”But writer Alan Moore has divorced himself from this and other adaptations of his comics after the critical failure of  “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.” Moore’s refusal to work with film teams forced Snyder to construct “Watchmen” from the viewer’s perspective. “In some ways it’s a truer experience for the viewer,” Snyder says, “because what I did was try to make the movie based on the experiences I had when first reading the graphic novel in 1988.”FICTIONAL CHARACTERS, REAL QUESTIONSThough it was written towards the end of the Cold War, “Watchmen” expresses timeless, fundamental concerns with the corruptive nature of power. Anthony F. Davis, owner of Harvard Square’s cornerstone comic store “Million Year Picnic,” says, “A lot of those writers of Moore’s generation were products of Thatcherism....When you think of ‘V for Vendetta’ or ‘Watchmen,’ they’re all about power. What do you do when you have great power? Even when you’re thinking about using it for the best of reasons, how close do you come to Fascism when attempting to implement that?”These questions can be extended beyond the world of superheroes. Snyder says the movie’s depth lies in the parallels that can be drawn between its costumed adventurers and real life political figures.  “Superhero politics and superpower politics are similar,” Snyder says. “What we learn from ‘Watchmen,’ from the graphic novel and hopefully a little bit from the movie, is that the morality of policing your neighbors, the morality of being a vigilante in the case of superheroes, is a slippery slope.”Snyder says he hopes the film will prompt the viewer to further ask, “‘Who polices the police?’ or ‘Who watches the Watchmen?’ or ‘Who governs the government?’”Focused more on illustration than narrative, comics did not always spark such philosophical debates. The switch that occurred in the second half of the 20th century transformed the genre into a more serious venture. “When I first started collecting comics and working the store in the 80s, it was about the guy who drew the book,” Davis says. “And there were well-known writers, but they weren’t the ones who moved the industry. That has flipped over the last 10 or 15 years. There are artists, but really the medium is being driven by writers.”“I think it started in a large part with Alan Moore and his work on ‘Swamp Thing’ and ‘Watchmen.’ What you wound up with is a host of more intelligent works.” While other comic book writers of the time shied away from the subtler nuances and deeper philosophical dilemmas, Moore welcomed them.“A lot of the superhero comics have always dealt with these characters with enormous abilities, if not enormous powers,” Davis says. “But not the realistic, ‘If I’m living in the world and I have the power to reshape it, why don’t I? Why don’t I end poverty? Why don’t I end injustice? Why don’t I end famine and draught?’ Superman never considers these things, or if he did, they were pretty quickly dismissed. I think Moore looks at more of those big picture issues.”TAKING COMICS SERIOUSLY The quality of the graphic novel continues to improve today, with writers such as Art Spiegelman producing Pulitzer prize-winning works. “I think that graphics as a medium has grown up with people like Marjane Satrapi and Speigelman,” says Adam L. Kern, an associate professor in the Department of East Asian Languages who teaches a class on Japanese literature. “And I think that’s been something that’s revolutionized comics. It’s no longer superheroes in underwear. Now comics have become more respectable and a more serious medium.” This evolution has led to a subversion of the traditional boundary between comics and literature.“You could be reading ‘Batman’ and ‘Daredevil,’ and it feels that you’re in a Dashiell Hammett novel,” Davis says. “In general the best comics nowadays are much better written than the comics written 20 or 30 years ago. The boundaries have changed.”Affirming this notion, Kern has integrated graphic novels into the curriculum of Japanese Literature 123: “Manga.” “I think that graphic novels, comics, manga, are a mode of expression, just the way the novel is a mode of expression,” Kern says. “Traditionally in the West, the novel has been accorded increasingly over the centuries more and more respect. Although, when it first began appearing, people looked at it askance. Graphic novels in the West have been systematically looked at askance and only within the past decades have people begun to give them a little bit more validity as a means of expression.”Many believe that comics are the Greek myths of our time, and as such, are worthy of critical attention. Considering the moral quandaries posed by a graphic novel like “Watchmen,” Dan I. Mazur, one of the founders of the Boston Comics Roundtable, a group of comic enthusiasts says, “I think these myths and legends are like if you grow up with the Greek Gods and then start exploring them in different ways.” “I don’t think that there is anything non-intellectual about superheroes,” Snyder reiterates. “There’s the perceived danger that we’re ‘dumbing’ ourselves down with superheroes but superheroes have the ability to be as intellectually stimulating as anything. I just think that people fight it a little bit.”Despite this perceived resistance, the demographics of the comics readership have been rapidly changing to include adults. “We’ve seen the young part of the readership fall away from the American mainstream comics,” says Davis, whose store just celebrated its 35th anniversary. “We don’t get the 10-, 12-, and 14-year-old boys that we used to get. They’ve been replaced by a more female readership, by more people in their 20s and 30s.”GRAPHIC SYLLABI?In addition to changes in content and readership, comic books are beginning to secure a new place in academia, albeit an incipient one. In addition to their place in “Manga,” Dr. Katherine Stanton, who currently teaches a freshman seminar called “American Splendor: Alternative American Comics,” includes graphic novels at the core of her curriculum. According to Dr. Stanton, both professors and students have noticed the change in comic books, which has prompted them to read these works more closely. “The quality of graphic narrative itself is better—there is simply more good stuff out there that’s worth our attention,” Stanton says. “Our students’ interest in comics and comic book form has also inspired us as teachers and scholars to pay more attention to the form. I think I’ve learned a lot from students for the last few years about why I should be paying attention to this medium.” Kern, who has also noticed this growing intellectual interest, attributes the trend to a generational attention to visual-based media. “I think that [increased interest in comics] probably has to do a little bit with the visual turn in our culture,” he says. “I think students are much more interested in consuming media that credit their capacity for what might be termed the visual-verbal imagination. So television, film, and the internet allow students to develop their visual-verbal imaginations. And, in the case of Japanese novels and graphic novels, students are also given an opportunity to give their visual-verbal imagination free expression.”Harvard professors who integrate comics into their coursework benefit from this enthusiasm, witnessing dramatic increases in class size. “I think that there has been something of a paradigmatic shift in recent years in which students entering Harvard over the past decade have become increasingly interested in comics and graphic novels,” says Kern, whose categorization of manga as Japanese literature has been questioned by various faculty members. “Professors who are able or willing to integrate comics into their courses have a tremendous opportunity to generate interest.”Despite the efforts of a few professors and a contingent of passionate students, the place of graphic novels in the Harvard curriculum remains marginal. “Graphic novels are so tragically understudied,” says Paul B. Vankoughnett ’12, a student in Stanton’s freshman seminar. “In college I will be taking tons and tons of classes that deal with reading books or reading papers or reading articles. This is probably the only class that I will ever take that deals with reading comic books.”—Staff writer Edward F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You know the first thing that happens when you turn on a Sega Genesis?” asked Shota Nakama, the guitarist at the Berklee Performance Center’s most recent sold-out concert. And in unison the entire audience, from the two five-year-old boys in the front row to the professorial composers scattered throughout the crowd, enthusiastically responded “Sega!” At once, the immense sound of the Video Game Orchestra filled the intimate venue with the “Sonic the Hedgehog” theme.	The VGO—comprised of a 45-piece classical orchestra, 40-piece choir, and 5-piece rock band—brings together students from Berklee College of Music, Boston University, Boston Conservatory, and New England Conservatory, and it’s just one example of the video game industry’s ability to serve as a forum of creative exploration and interaction for artists. Despite the recent economic downturn, global sales of video games have risen since 2007, reaching $32 billion at the end of the last fiscal year, according to the Berklee College website. While most other art forms struggle to find support from a weary and wary society, more and more artists are looking to the video game industry for lucrative and creative outlets for their work. At nearby Brandeis University, the college’s administrative staff recently announced the closing of its Rose Art Museum and the sale of its 6,000 piece collection. But at Berklee, art more than thrives; it ventures into uncharted grounds, boldly pioneering an unconventional form—the video game.	Students and faculty at Berklee have been sharply attuned to the success of the video game industry. Two years ago, the push began for a new school-wide curriculum that includes composition of video game music. The school has hired more faculty for this purpose and is also working to develop a degree program specific to the genre. “A few of the students at Berklee formed this group called the Video Game Music Club,” says Michael D. Sweet, a professor in the Film Scoring department who teaches a class on “Interactive Scoring for Games.” “Now it’s over 200 members, and they were really instrumental in pushing the administration. All of my students are super excited. They’re really enthusiastic about learning how to craft music specifically for video games.” Other, more traditional music programs generally only offer one semester classes that serve as basic surveys of video game scoring. Berklee’s curriculum, however, continues to grow with the enthusiastic support of its students, the college, and the public.  BIGGER THAN A BLIPComposers with training in film scoring who looked to commercial media for career options are now turning to the video game industry. However, the transition between the two is not quite so simple.“When you’re doing a film, you’re doing a specific scene—for instance, where you know that the girl kisses the guy at 40 seconds and you have to set that point. In a video game someone could take two minutes or five minutes on a given level, and you still have to score for the dramatic arc of the story in real time,” Sweet says. “The player is actually controlling the narrative arc of the story, and as a composer you have to allow the timing to change based on what the player is doing.”The video game industry, with its ever-expanding budget, has recognized the additional challenges this genre of music poses. As a result, according to Berklee College’s website, composers can receive up to $2,000 for each minute of music they write.For burgeoning composers interested in commercial music, this generous pay is good news. “There are increasingly less and less film opportunities,” composer and Music concentrator Eric W. Lin ’09 says. “Usually the really big budget studio films are dominated by anywhere between 10 to 30 names.”Unlike composers of film scores who have achieved respect and status—the first Oscar for Best Original Music Score was given in the 1930s, shortly after the advent of Hollywood’s “Talking Pictures”—video game composers still encounter skepticism about their work. Nakama, founder of the VGO and the first vice-president of the Video Game Music Club at Berklee, says that he created the club to promote video game music as a genre. “Video game music is really underrated still,” Nakama says.While most people envision video game music as the typified Super Mario Brothers’ theme song of the ’80s, over the past five to 10 years, much of its composition has moved to extremely complex orchestral scoring. It no longer fulfills what Sweet calls the “assumption that video game music is a bunch of blips and boops and beeps.”  THE ART OF VIDEO GAMESThe recent recession has illuminated the degree to which art is dependent on its patrons. Economy is inherently necessary to support the creation of art. Video game music composition, perhaps more than any other genre, struggles with the stigma of being a monetized art form—one which caters exclusively to a client’s vision rather than the artist’s. This deeply engrained Romantic model of the artist and his muse might result in a public reluctance to accept video game music as a worthy pursuit.“There’s a degree of compromise there, and I think anyone who tells you there is no compromise is lying,” Lin says. “But working within constraints isn’t necessarily a bad thing for an artist. It allows you to grow in ways that otherwise you wouldn’t.”These restrictions may, in fact, lay the foundation for a new artistic space, says Edward C. Barrett, Senior Lecturer in the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies at MIT. In this conceptual arena, artists have the chance to expand the horizons of their current media by focusing different perceptions on their work and utilizing new creative techniques.“My approach has always been that these are new narrative and rhetorical spaces, and there is no reason why someone who has had the benefit, let’s say, of a Harvard education in the humanities should not find that as a place for expression,” Barrett says. “People can make statements about [this space’s] current incarnation and how it might not live up to some of the other standards, and that’s fine. That’s criticism that one should pay attention to. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not capable of something more.”There are, undoubtedly, certain aspects of video games that fall short of the orthodox expectation of “art”—it is likely that an LCD screen will never grace the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Nonetheless, the industry has shown signs of growing away from its less favorable stereotypes. “The boundaries of video games have expanded beyond just the typical hardcore gamer that sits in his basement and plays Halo,” Sweet says. “There are also people in nursing homes playing Wii Fit, sisters playing Nintendogs for Nintendo DS.”And indeed, musicians are not the only ones benefiting from the opportunities this kind of space can offer.“The video game industry draws lots of different kinds of students into it,” says Barrett, who teaches a class that explores writing in the new media. One of the focuses of the course includes creating plotlines for video games. “You have students who are interested in the more technical aspects of it, like the programming, and you have students who might be interested in the visual design aspects of it.”“I think what is especially attractive is the way it supports individual interaction and creative collaboration,” he adds.Students who have followed the rise of the video game industry have an even simpler answer for its recent success, though.“Well,” Nakama says, “it is fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness abound in New York City these days. Well, not really but the “Age of Aquarius” has come back to Broadway with the new revival of “Hair,” and 50 Harvard College students got a sneak peek at its final dress rehearsal a day before previews began on March 6. Sponsored by the Office for the Arts at Harvard (OFA), the event gave the attendees an insider’s view of the making of a Broadway musical. It is emblematic of the new direction the College has taken in an attempt to provide off-campus artistic experiences for students. “Hair” is directed by Diane M. Paulus ’87, artistic director of the American Repertory Theatre. Generally considered the definitive rock musical, “Hair” debuted at The Public Theatre in 1967, where it returned this past summer for a successful run—also directed by Paulus—before it moved to its current home on Broadway.In an attempt to forge a connection with students involved in theater, Paulus provided the tickets. “Diane Paulus is really passionate about wanting to strengthen ties with students and the OFA,” says Eric C. Engel, director of the Memorial Hall/Lowell Hall Complex and one of the chaperones of the trip. “It’s a big deal to open a show like this, so it’s a great opportunity to celebrate her work and support her and learn from her. Offering tickets to the rehearsal was a wonderful gesture.”Students were equally excited to take part in the unique experience. Paulus’ invitation to undergraduates is representative of the emphasis she places on inclusiveness. “Paulus is currently planning her first season at the A.R.T., and I was really hoping to get a preview of the kind of theater we can expect from them now that she’s in charge,” Matthew C. Stone ’11 says. “It’s great to have someone at the head of the A.R.T. who clearly cares so much about the undergraduate theater community and is willing to work with the OFA and student groups to bring us these opportunities.”Inclusiveness was a feature that was also incorporated into the show itself. Audience involvement has been one of the many aspects that have made the revival so successful, even in its early stages. “Paulus seeks to break down the idea that the audience is a passive entity in theater, which doesn’t necessarily work for every production, but it was certainly the right way to go with ‘Hair,’” Elizabeth J. Krane ’11 says.The entire production of “Hair”—a show that chronicles the stories of a group of hippies, led by idealistic Claude (Gavin Creel) and rebellious Berger (Will Swenson), as they deal with sex, love, politics, and the counterculture of the sixties—has an organic feel. Oriental rugs cover the stage and spill out into the orchestra seating. Cast members freely interact with the audience, even wandering onstage to perform yoga before the show begins. “Hair”—part rock concert and part Broadway spectacle—is also part Human Be-In. Like the sentiments created by “be-ins,” a phenomenon of the 1960s that revolved around protesting authority, “Hair” manifests the concept of audience interactivity by making the show not just a show, but rather, a group experience.All of these elements come together after the curtain call as the audience joins the cast onstage in an exuberant dance to “The Flesh Failures (Let the Sunshine In),” the closing number of the show.Although “Hair” does not officially open on Broadway until March 31, there were few technical or creative missteps to be found. The ensemble, also known as the Tribe, works as one joyous, lively unit. Creel’s beautiful, smooth voice and compelling acting sustain his character, Claude, as the emotional core of the show, while Swenson’s Berger provides a perfect counterbalance of raw power and sexuality. Big numbers such as “Aquarius,” “I Got Life,” and the corresponding “Black Boys” and “White Boys,” crackle with energy and electricity. Claude’s joy could easily be stemming from the success of the production as he sings, “I got life, mother. I got laughs, sister. I got freedom, brother. I got good times, man.”Good times and building bridges were the themes of the day, a success for the OFA’s attempt to encourage communication with undergraduates involved with or interested in professional theater. “It’s great to see new faces that we don’t work with a lot. The trip has bridged a lot of gaps between people active in theater here and people who are just interested in theater,” says Dana Knox, production coordinator of the New College Theatre.Yet the extent to which connections have been forged between these two groups remains uncertain. The trip was advertised mostly through Harvard arts forums, such as the OFA newsletter “The Beat,” the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s newsletter, and the OFA’s Facebook group, so it comes as no surprise that many of the attendees are already heavily involved in theater.“The OFA’s ‘Hair’ trip had good intentions in attempting to bring together diverse groups of people, but I don’t think its goals were met,” says an active member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club who requested not to be identified. “The students who are already involved in theater and who know Diane Paulus, even if only on a name-recognition basis, went not only to see the dress rehearsal of ‘Hair’ but also to support her work. I’m not sure the students who did not know of Diane beforehand actually appreciate any more the fact that Diane Paulus is the director at the A.R.T. or will come see more theater and get more involved because of it.”Still, the trip to “Hair” is a hopeful sign that collaborations between the OFA, the A.R.T., and students will continue far into the future. This event has laid the first brick towards building increased and rare opportunities for undergraduates to encounter art outside of the College. “If the OFA and A.R.T. continue working together, the theater scene at Harvard will become more cohesive,” Stone says, “and there will be more occasions for students to have experiences in the professional theater like this.”In other words, let the sun shine in.—Staff writer Ali R.

Is Michelle Obama the Rosie the Riveter of the Bernie Madoff era? Maureen Dowd seems to think so. “Let’s face it,” she writes in the New York Times, “The only bracing symbol of American strength right now is the image of Michelle Obama’s sculpted biceps.” In recent weeks the First Lady’s skin-bearing sartorial habits have become something of a controversy. Co-columnist David Brooks has even gone so far as to assert that Obama, so as not to be known for her “physical presence, for one body part,” should cover up her arms. This is nothing new. Women in the public eye have always faced reduction to a single symbolic body part, especially when they make an effort to appear both strong and feminine. Beyoncé—she of the reflective fabrics, hair extensions, and mis-accented given name and, of course, The Booty—knows a thing or two about navigating the waters between independence and the expected level of feminine passivity. For Beyoncé (at least publicly) being a woman is a complicated charge, so difficult to navigate that it is often easier to section parts of herself off from the whole rather than try to keep all of the pieces together. She is both resolute and self-sustaining; unabashedly sexual, though her principles of sexuality are often divorced from their praxis. One day she’s an Independent Woman, and the next she wants to take the backseat and Upgrade U.On the track “Upgrade U,” Mrs. Jay-Z suggests that in spite of her independence, she is partial to relationships that are secure and run, “by the man, but the women keep the tempo.” “It’s very seldom that you’re blessed to find your equal,” she sings on, only to declare, “Still play my part and let you take the lead role.” Beyoncé has become the most bootylicious disciple of a school of thought that glamorizes the dichotomy of declaring your independence while aspiring to find a man to lead and provide for you. Up until recently, this practice of compartmentalizing emotions and egos has seemed relatively natural. Many artists oscillate between moods and styles successfully, though with her most recent album, “I Am… Sasha Fierce,” Beyoncé offers a much more concrete and arbitrary delineation between aspects of her personality. No longer does she simply fluctuate between being naughty, sensual or pensive; alternative emotions are now the domain of someone else, another woman. Her alter ego: Sasha Fierce. Michelle Obama does not, debatably, have the option of creating an alter ego. Her distinctive physical appearance, especially in Washington, has the dangerous potential to overshadow her opinions and policies. And were Michelle Obama to have any problems with people thinking her dim-witted or incompetent, I might even agree with David Brooks. She does not, however, face such issues.It seems as though Brooks and those in his camp are perturbed, perhaps, by something they find more fundamentally unsettling: the First Lady’s overwhelming capacity for duality. She is strong and motherly, sensual, while still serious and successful. Particularly, it seems that many are concerned with how the coexistence of these traits might come across as threatening when exhibited by one woman. In this light, “cover them up” can be viewed as a veiled call for self-segmentation.Michelle Obama seems to have harmonized what all feminists—first wave, second wave, lipstick, or stiletto—ostensibly aspire to: that women can live as their true selves, unconstrained by inequitable societal demands. As First Lady, it appears as though Mrs. Obama will exhibit all of the aforementioned dualities, at once. She need not seesaw between being a stateswoman and a mother, habitué of the haute monde and a J. Crewian everywoman. She is not all of those women, she is simply one woman, with many facets.In a 2004 speech, then-Senator Obama declared that we must, “eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.” Similarly, we must stamp out the belief that a woman who is layered, and can react to her environment without fundamentally changing herself, is somehow abnormal or unacceptable. Hip-hop, perhaps even more than other styles of music, is certainly not immune to this particular kind of slander.Ms. Knowles a leader in a musical genre that either by effect or cause has traded many of its original political and social intentions for success and acceptance. How many mainstream hip-hop acts, let alone female hip-hop acts, have emerged over the last decade that have remained committed to bringing about positive social change? It’s a strange way to come about a point, I know, but Michelle Obama has made clear that women—arms and all—can be complex, capable, and still whole. This is a sentiment missing from current mainstream hip-hop, and one that could easily be echoed by its female artists. Blessed be the day when Beyoncé and Sasha Fierce are one and the same.—Columnist Ruben L. Davis can be reached at rldavis@fas.harvard.edu.

For fans of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Seiji Ozawa captured the image of the frizzy, white haired, eccentric conductor. At the tender of age of 42, however, Alan T. Gilbert ’89, musical director designate of the world-renowned New York Philharmonic, belies such stereotypes. His career has skyrocketed from music director of the Harvard Bach Society Orchestra to his current position. It would be understandable for someone with such a young and illustrious career to be a bit cocky, but Gilbert is decidedly down-to-earth. At a Learning From Performers event at the New College Theatre last Friday, he was amicable, reflective, and insightful. He called his time at Harvard “amazing” and recounted his formative experiences at the university. Born in New York City in 1967, Gilbert grew up in a musical family; his father Michael Gilbert, his mother Yoko Takebe (a player in the Philharmonic), and his sister Jennifer Gilbert are all prominent violinists. While attending Harvard College, he lived in Adams House and nurtured broad academic interests. Gilbert attempted to major in English, but was unable to complete the requirements in time for graduation. He returned to his original music concentration so late in his career that he claims he was “probably the most pathetic music concentrator ever.” It was in his extra-curricular involvement with music that Gilbert found the freedom and flexibility he wanted. Describing the Harvard arts community as “magical” in its enthusiasm, Gilbert fondly recalled concerts that were “self-generated,” off-the-cuff performances organized entirely on the initiative of student musicians. Gilbert spoke of one particularly noteworthy performance in Adams House where, “after the first four notes, the crowd broke into cheers and [the orchestra] had to stop.” When asked whether he ever regretted giving up the more structured musical instruction of a conservatory for Harvard, he answered “never.”The spontaneous and intense music scene at Harvard exposed him to responsibilities that he may have missed out on otherwise. In organizing concerts with his friends, Gilbert learned a do-it-yourself work ethic that would be the envy of many punk rock bands. He recalled having to coordinate everything from rehearsals to publicity campaigns for his concerts. “[B]eing aware of the whole range of elements that go into a concert was invaluable experience that I got in a very special way,” Gilbert said. The same hands-on, initiative-taking approach that Gilbert exercised in organizing concerts proved valuable in Gilbert’s sophomore year. That year, Harvard was celebrating its 350th anniversary and Leonard Bernstein ’39, who was then conductor of the New York Philharmonic, was tapped to give the keynote address to conclude the festivities. Cognizant of the lengthy parade of speakers before him, Bernstein let the audience vote on whether they wanted to hear his speech; they voted him down. Seizing the moment, Gilbert and a few of his friends personally begged Bernstein to come give the speech at Adams House. Bernstein, who knew Gilbert’s parents as violinists in the Philharmonic, agreed on two conditions: the attendance of then President Derek Bok and two bottles of Scotch. Reminiscing about the magic of his experiences at Harvard, Gilbert remarked, “it feels as though it could only happen here.” Before earning his position at the Philharmonic, Gilbert conducted symphonies in Cincinnati, Santa Fe, and Stockholm. One audience member asked him for his opinion of the state of arts in America today, and as part of his response, he articulated his vision for what artists in the public sphere can do for the greater community in which they reside. “I want the New York Philharmonic to be more than an orchestra that happens to be in New York. I want the New York Philharmonic to mean something for all New Yorkers on some level,” he said. “An orchestra performing at the highest level should be a source of civic pride.” Throughout the course of the conversation, Gilbert offered up a personal account of the opportunities that the arts community at Harvard can provide, not just for those directly and personally involved but for all students.“Harvard is an incredibly artistic place,” Gilbert said, “[The arts are]gratifying and important and [they are] what makes life beautiful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And by then it was too late to stop my parade down the aisle!  Proud fool that I was, I hadn’t taken Daddy’s arm when we’d left Marshall and Mrs. Graham.  I just assumed he was behind me.  But while Daddy stopped at the sanctuary doors to gab away, I was already flouncing down the aisle, unaware and unaccompanied!Well, don’t you know that just when I got out into the big middle of everything that blasted organ cut off.  I was walking—clanking—down the center aisle in hideous silence for all to see.  Reverend Lewis was just sauntering up to the pulpit, oblivious to the fact that his words could have broken the stillness and saved me humiliation.  He finally motioned for the crowd to rise—but that just left them standing there, in a dithering hush, with nothing to ogle but my everlasting journey down the longest aisle the Lord has ever wrought upon his people (no offense to Him).By the time I’d passed the Negro section, I think the color of my cheeks had ebbed to a mere tomato.  But by the time I squeezed into our usual pew at the front, my blood was frothing:  couldn’t I just enjoy the service like all the others?  The others, mind you, who had pounced over every inch of this town after running most of us out?  Or so Daddy said.And speak of the chatterbox, he arrived at my side before the end of the prayer.  He gave my shoulder one full pat, unaware of the great mortification that had just occurred under his watch.Reverend Lewis yelped “Amen!” and we moved on to “the twelfth chapter of the Book of Psalms.”  The reverend and his people went back and forth but I soon fell out of reading.  My makeshift courage (my orange corsage) was looking lovelier every minute.  Luckily it was on the side away from my father, so I could admire it as big as I pleased.By the time the organ was cranking out “Up From the Grave He Arose,” I was well on my way to good spirits.  Everybody around me started to pivot and scoop for hymnals.  And I was already humming away as I, too, slid my hands around the pew pocket.  But there was nary a hymnal.  I straightened back up, I looked left, I looked right.  I even rocked onto my toes to peer down the far ends of the pews.  All empty.  Daddy didn’t have a hymnal either but he was looking on with Mrs. Hannway.  The same thing for the stranger on my left.I really did try worshipping with everybody else.  But I hadn’t actually sung the song for a year or two (or five...not since ’61?).  And the more I tried to sing, the less I knew, and the sorer I got.  All I could do was loll there, dead in the water like some windless sloop.  But didn’t I have a right to these words?  To get to sing them like everybody else?I looked right, past Daddy (warbling away), and saw the pew stuffed to its end.  So I looked left.  It was full but not crammed.And then, over the thundering third verse, I began my spate of “Exuse me”s and “I’m sorry”s and sometimes even “So sorry”s. Heading back for that wretched center aisle.Most of the folks I squeezed past were as pliant as bur reeds.  I could see they were thinking how this never happened at their churches up North.  They shuffled their bodies with haughty huffs but I bore it, just as I should have.  But when I got to the man at the end, an elderly fellow who was more than a little tone deaf, I tried to wedge past only to receive the most self-righteous eye roll I’d ever seen.“Well, I’m sorry,” I said in a real acute whisper.“No you’re not,” he shot back.  Then he immediately went back to singing.  The insolent codger!I flushed with shame as I was thrust from the pew.  Of course I couldn’t challenge his abuse now that I stood in plain sight of every parishioner (yet again!).  So, what could I do but offer him a winsome smirk—a way of saying to everyone else, “No no, that might’ve looked nasty but Mr. Oswald is such a dear.  He can just get a little carried away when he’s singing alto.”Thus began my flaming flight to the back of the church.  At first I felt real sheepish.  I tried not to look at anyone, I kept my head down.  But then I remembered why I was hoofing it back there in the first place:  wasn’t I due what all these people already had? They all had hymnals, and I bet half of them sang flatter than Old Man Grumpy.  So I lifted my dress and my head—all the better to march with!  Most of the folks grimaced at me or even glared an apology to whoever was standing next to them.  But the few pious sheep of the flock (all Southerners, I’m sure) kept to their singing and one boy even flashed me an impertinent grin.  But by this time, all of it was impertinent.  A faith in what I knew I deserved was firing me up.  Like I had that great piece of news I’d heard before anyone else.  How it bore me on!  Then I was past the Negro section and had thrown open both doors.Breezing into the foyer, I almost smiled as I gulped down big breaths of relief.  I’d nearly spun a full circle before I spotted the stack of hymnals.  With both hands I grabbed the one on top.  I was already turning to the right page (Hymn 138 praise be!) as I scampered back to the entrance.  But one of the oak doors blasted open.  I sprang back to avoid a smash.  Boy was I was ready to loose my tongue on that varlet.  But, to my disappointment, it was only Ezekiel.Ezekiel is one robust man—a foot taller than Daddy and almost twenty years younger—but he sure moves slow.  And by the time all his burliness had come through the doors, the song had hit its last chorus.“Hi,” I said, smiling and trying to get by.“Miss Winnie, what you doing out here?”“Just going back in.”  I leaned towards the door.“Real handsome sight in there.  The flowers, and folks looking their best.”“Yes.  Well, I’ll see you after the service.”  I grabbed the door’s handle and threw it back.  But the music had stopped.  And the heads were bowing.  And I was left there, at the brink of the congregation.    I should have gone in.  It would have been real easy—no one looking and me sneaking in on silent toes.  But I’d never seen our sanctuary like this:  churchgoers stacked pew after pew, heads down, bodies fixed.  Here and there husbands had arms around wives.  Mothers had hands around the necks of their little miscreants.  And after the “Amen,” smatterings of conversation kept the people up, or slowed their sitting to a jolly drifting.  It looked to me like there was a whole lot of satisfaction going on between these Northerners and, to be frank, I thought it was disgusting.Well, the insincerity got me so caught up that I missed my chance to go back in.  Now some deacon or other went to the pulpit to blab about some calendar of evangelism and I let the door close with a squeak from it and a sigh from me.To think I’d have to wait even more!  The announcements would go for a hundred years.I slunk back to the foyer.Why not get a little talking in while I was out here? “Ezekiel,” I called out.  He was heading, oddly enough, for the outside doors.  But he turned and took a step towards me.  “Yes, Miss Winnie.”“Where do you think you’re sneaking?”“I’s leaving.”“Well, that’s no good.”He waited politely.“May I ask why?”“Well, as you know, my hearing’s been real poor since the accident.  So there ain’t much of the service I can hear.”Was that silence I heard?  I whirled around as I tossed him a “Well, Happy Easter!” and scurried back to the sanctuary.  I gave a tiny prod to the left door.  But only to hear a new deacon blathering on about Fellowship Stew.I turned back to the foyer as I looked down at my hymnal.  To come out here to get what I should have already had!  And then to be kept from going back in!And there was Ezekiel going out the doors.  “Ezekiel.”The shambles of clouds and mist and morning lit up the open door.  I couldn’t see his face but I could discern his good ear turning towards me.I took a few steps towards him and saw the light trickle out as he came back in.“It’s just a shame you’re going to miss Easter.”	Then he laughed.  “It’ll still be Easter out there.”“But can’t you enjoy just being here?  Being with people like you—your friends, I mean.”“Course.  But the problem, Miss Winnie, is that when I can’t hear anything I start up thinking.  ‘Bout if Miss Pam’s all right and hoping my two boys ain’t giving her trouble—if they was unruly I’d always be the one to take care of it, but Miss Pam’s too gentle for that. So then I get anxious that she can’t be enjoying her Easter if my boys is acting up.  But that ain’t to say I ain’t thinking ‘bout my boys also.”I’d been trying to listen to the sanctuary when Ezekiel finally stopped I heard Reverend Lewis praying. The sermon was here!

“Sensitivity isn’t being wimpy,” Jeff Buckley once declared. “It’s about being so painfully aware that a flea landing on a dog is like a sonic boom.” While Kathy Nilsson refrains from such gestures of grandiose pomposity, her poems are imbued with a similar ear for the power of the mundane. “The Abattoir” is a chapbook with 23 poems that frequently use the everyday to direct the reader on to more abstract concerns of love, loss, and a decaying spirituality. Written in Cambridge and published out of Georgetown, Kentucky, the poems frequently evoke the spirit of down-home Americana. In “Window-Shopping,” a broken-hearted man stares into the windows of a “haberdashery.” In “Overwintering”, a man looking at “all the lovely things of this world” looks first at apples. Yet this combination of the everyday and the American is lost in an endless barrage of imagery that typically rings false. If a first rule of paint-by-numbers poetry is distinctive images, Nilsson appears to have taken this rule to heart, and too dramatically at that. Her images are certainly distinctive—from “The Procures,” “a mountain sitting in a fair sky, girls / of gentle birth sheathed in goatskin and tulle.” The latter image is one of several in this collection that allude to our distant, primeval past. Yet these distinctive images are lost by dilution, by the worst kind of overkill. Take this stanza from “Underground Beauty”: “Inside, tiny sparkling / mineral, gypsum flowers, / lettuce and coral, shy trident / bats, fairy shrimp- / eggs which hatch after fifteen years.” Poets have used lists to great effect before. But unlike Gerard Manley Hopkins in “Pied Beauty,” a poem similarly concerned with nature and spirituality, Nilsson merely lists. The words above have no particular rhythmic quality; the enjambments do not aid the poem’s flow. This list style, prevalent throughout the collection, ensures that these images, individually so enigmatic and striking, lose their impact and individuality. The reader would need endless patience, not to mention an excellent dictionary, to parse the intricacies of every single poem. That is not to mention the innumerable times when Nilsson’s extravagant similes and metaphors strain the limits even of poetic license. “They left like young autumn octopuses,” she writes of “The Infant Scholars.” Mere originality is not noteworthy. And “originality” so overtly forced is overbearing and dull. Even less convincing are the attempts scattered throughout “The Abbatoir” at accompanying the themes and motifs of animals, the elemental and the bona fide American, with a feigned exoticism. This takes the form of meaningless phrases that refer to “Abroad”—typically Europe. Thus we read of “Italian Bees Grazing a Table in August”; never mind that the fact that they are Italian has no discernible import for the poem. Similarly, in “Surgery,” “A dusting of snow / fastens to roofs / on a row of Delft houses.” In the first poem, “Ornament,” Nilsson informs her interlocutor that “Your heart is as large as an anthill in Switzerland”—presumably, the heart in question is non-existent. Elsewhere, the poet takes us to Lapland, treads on Persian rugs, compares the heart to a “timber mansion on the Bosporus” and watches deer in Auvers while musing about Cezanne’s apples—tall traveling orders for such a brief collection. Yet this preponderance of bizarre images and places is compounded by Nilsson’s decision to emphasize her most unusual and least meaningful through the use of italics. Italicization in poetry is a hokey maneuver at the best of times; unlike in prose, it is susceptible to use, or rather misuse, as a means not to emphasize meaning but rather to draw attention to a phrase that the poet considers exceptional. Nilsson has a bad case of this affliction. In the closing poem, “Cleaning the Icons,” she writes of “a naughtment of the self;” both the italicization of “a” as well as the use of “naughtment” emphasize only mind-numbing pretension. Yet on the next page itself she writes of “souls of cork,” an utterly needless use of the same conceit. It is shame that all of this obscures the collection’s strengths. Chief among these is its unity of vision, its continual concern with the similarity of human life to animal life, of our continuity with our animal ancestors. Not only is this a unique and compelling theme for a book of poetry, it also provides a framework in which the poet’s less outlandish imagery can at times be evocative and startling. The collection’s most moving lines, from “Sympathetic Magic,” are an illustration of this: “We fell out below human range, / with a kitten’s commitment to sleep, / in a paired lightening, peaceful, like the spotted / leopard lying with its unfinished gazelle.”There are several nice touches here, such as the clever pun of “lightening.” Most of all, however, its exquisite juxtaposition of those timeless poetic partners, the ugly and the beautiful, makes it surprising and memorable. Much as with the word “abattoir,” it is an ugly thing beautifully described. And Nilsson is at her best when is she is restrained, unassuming, even quiet. If only she was these things more often.

What is it about violence that we find so alluring? The cult of the slasher film, once considered a perverse, transgressive genre, has morphed into the unapologetic torture-porn fad. The genre of television detective drama has collapsed into gore-fests like those featured on “CSI.” Violence has become the stuff of the banal, and yet retains its mystic and exotic appeal. Valentin Groebner, one of Germany’s up-and-coming historians, takes a look at this phenomenon, grounding it centuries ago in the visual culture of the Middle Ages. Groebner’s claim provides the basis for “Defaced,” where he attempts to link today’s media-led fascination with horror and graphic depictions of mutilated bodies to the torture and religious martyrdom that was commonplace in the 15th century. He claims that his interest in the subject originally “did not lie in material from the past, but in the heightened presentability of opened and mutilated bodies in close-up, in concert with political events—with the return of war in the everyday life of the European media.” While an appealing and quick read on the dark side of the Middle Ages, “Defaced” falls short of its goal: to provide a lens with which to understand the modern fascination with horror.“Defaced” is both well-written and accessible. Filled with visual aids, it serves as a comprehensive introduction for readers with no previous exposure to art history or medieval culture. Despite its qualities as a work of art history, however, it lacks credibility as a work of social theory. The book begins with a comment on a photograph of the mutilated body of an anonymous Haitian in Port au Prince in 1994. At the end of the book, Groebner revisits the framework of modernity with insights about the media driven obsession with anonymity and gory coverage of current events in the news. But he never convincingly substantiates the link between violence in medieval culture and contemporary fetishization of the gruesome. His myriad examples of medieval brutality serve to illuminate a variety of individual points about the culture of the Middle Ages—the importance of blood to embody sacrifice, the symbol of the nose as linked to sexual mutilation, or the violent religious expressions of martyrdom—but it’s difficult to see the coherence of his overall argument about its meaning today.Groebner’s exploration of the medieval obsession with the nose as the prime organ of sexual mutilation is particularly engaging. His examination of 15th century Nuremberg reveals that the cutting of one’s nose was most often associated to adultery, homosexuality, and other sex crimes. The nose was also supposed to reveal whether or not a woman was still a virgin, based on the thickness of her cartilage. Anecdotes like this, revealing a common and fascinating trend in the medieval understanding and cultural depiction of the body, provide much of the book’s worth, which ultimately resides in Groebner’s masterful knowledge of the mores of the Middle Ages. Considerable attention is also given to the emblematically horrific depiction of the Passion of Jesus Christ in the Middle Ages. Groebner astutely renders Christendom’s dualistic fascination, both with “fear-inducing images on one side and a more positively connoted ‘affective piety’ on the other.” Religion was a haven for violent representations of sin and punishment, boosting numerous tales of severed organs and sexual mortifications, as well as an emphasis on the shedding of the Christ’s blood. The chapter on religion and representation of the Christ is the longest, and emphasizes the weight of religious images in the visual culture of the Middle Ages. Although Groebner raises insightful assertions about this phenomenon, he never effectively links it to its modern connotations or interpretations, therefore weakening his wider argument about medieval visual culture influencing the modern appeal of violence.Although Groebner does not convincingly support his thesis about the influential weight of medieval images on modern day depiction of violence—aside from pop-cultural references such as Pulp Fiction’s famous “I’m gonna git Medieval on your ass”—his array of violent and terrifying stories are not devoid of meaning. Groebner weaves them together through the notion of “Ungestalt,” the “reflection of violence that the narrator locates beyond his ‘own,’ ordered, regulated realm in a savage ‘outside.’” The idea that violence must be found in an exotic “other” permeates the themes of the book, with otherness taking the shape of sexuality, religion and the polity in the Middle Ages. Ungestalt is also found in modern depictions of terror, with what Groebner refers to as “lustful and aggressive self-victimization.” Although most European societies are maintaining an ever increasing level of peace and order, he stipulates that the violent news coverage trend in the media keeps growing. Groebner argues that people need fear and violence, regardless of its actual predominance—or lack thereof—around them. Still, it’s a shame that he couldn’t manage to use the skill with which he depicts the evolution of Ungestalt in the rest of “Defaced.”Beyond its redemptive educational and entertainment value, “Defaced,” remains simply an historical account of violence and its depictions, one that fails, for the most part, in its attempt to ground itself in the present. This still doesn’t negate the fact that Groebner has assembled a compelling assortment of bizarre and intriguing stories that our collective past would otherwise rather forget.

From its dark opening scene, Zack Snyder’s “Watchmen” establishes a complex blend of murder mystery, social commentary, and unrepentant action flick. This mood is immediately set as brawny Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) fails to fight off an unidentified attacker in his home. Viewers—assuming they have not read the graphic novel—can only speculate as to the assassin’s identity, but Blake knows, telling his killer that their world is a joke before he is hurled out a high-rise window.Creating this world has required years of imagination. The greatest challenge facing the creation of “Watchmen” has always been the legacy of its inspiration, the classic 1986-7 graphic novel written by Alan Moore. Moore, who deliberately divorces himself from all film adaptations of his works—including “V for Vendetta” and “From Hell”—left a daunting task for eager filmmakers. Any worthy onscreen adaptation would need to capture the gritty depth and scope that have made the book so influential, while preserving the pace and stylistic flair of a thriller.In conveying the book’s events and emotion, Snyder largely succeeds. The high revenue of his last directorial project, “300,” gained him leverage in resisting Warner Bros.’ efforts to shorten and update the film. With an R rating, Snyder was able to embrace the sex and violence of the novel and maintain its setting: a fictional 1985 in which a fifth-term Nixon celebrates American triumph in Vietnam. Our insight into this alternate reality comes from primary narrator and protagonist Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), whose deliciously gravel voice, hangdog look, and uncanny resemblance to his novel counterpart lend the movie its most gripping and startling moments.Snyder’s cast performs smoothly and largely carries the tone of the story—unabashed, raw violence coupled with an underlying black humor. Close behind Haley for outstanding performance in the film is Morgan, who appears to us as his alter-ego The Comedian in a series of flashbacks. Several other cast members invoke their characters with the appropriate panache and emotional range, notably Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg, the former Nite Owl II.The casting of British actor Matthew Goode (“Brideshead Revisited”) as Adrian Veidt—the billionaire who profits off his former life as Ozymandias, the smartest, quickest man alive—unnecessarily worried the novel’s fanbase. The slightly effeminate Goode is not the obvious choice to play the square-jawed super-athlete of the novel, but he delivers a solid interpretation of the character. The cast’s real weak link is its passive female romantic lead, Malin Akerman. Though the Swede’s delivery is mostly flawless, she at times seems bored or perhaps confused with her role as Laurie Jupiter, also known as Silk Spectre II. In her scenes of budding romance with Wilson’s Nite Owl, Silk Spectre II would benefit from an actress with a more charismatic presence, giving Wilson more maneuverability. His character’s gradual growth—overcoming social awkwardness, self-doubt, and even erectile dysfunction—would be one of the movie’s gems if paired with a better target of affection.The film remains an immersive experience. Its heavy, disheartening examination of society’s periodic wish for self-destruction builds through long, brooding scenes and stunningly detailed panoramas—from Blake’s lonely, rainy funeral to Veidt’s ancient Egyptian-style retreat in Antarctica. This attention to detail, however, inevitably makes the movie feel slow at times. The viewer must embrace it and soak in the film’s visual extravagance, or reject it and battle moments of boredom, which at 163 minutes the movie cannot avoid.The film’s saving quality is that when it seems to be losing momentum, Snyder injects humor to restore the tempo. And “Watchmen” certainly laughs at itself at times, from its over-the-top sex scene to some comical music choices, such as “Ride of the Valkyries” as Dr. Manhattan wins in Vietnam. Inclusion of Jimi Hendrix’s rendition of “All Along the Watchtower” and the overused Simon and Garfunkel hit “The Sounds of Silence” feels heavy-handed and forced, but Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are a-Changin’” brilliantly caps a montage explaining the alternate world in which the Watchmen reside. This is almost enough to forgive Leonard Cohen’s painful original performance of “Hallelujah,” which plays to laughably awful effect as the Nite Owl rediscovers his libido.“Watchmen” has flaws, but Snyder has proven that translating it to the screen could be done, and done well. The old caution, however, that the book should be read first, applies here more than ever. To fall asleep during this film would be an unfortunate waste, and though he is not credited in the film, one should pay respect to the brilliance of Moore’s original before enjoying this film as a second course. —Staff writer Alexander R.

“Miss March” is a shitshow—literally. You know a movie is desperate when volatile explosions of feces constitute the film’s only real thread of comedy. In a world where boys will be boys and girls will be their playthings, “Miss March” slinks into a well-established lineup of testosterone-fueled “comedies” undercut by a dearth of real humor. The film lacks its own voice, and its characters are in an incessant struggle to find a wit that is uniquely theirs. Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore—two of the actors from IFC’s “The Whitest Kids U’Know”—direct, produce, and star in the film, which is little more than a failed narcissistic foray into the unforgiving world of the feature-length movie. The plot is typical bromance fodder. After waking up from four years in a coma, Eugene Bell (Cregger) discovers that his once virginal high-school girlfriend Cindi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi), has become a Playboy centerfold. His pre-coma best friend Tucker Cleigh (Moore) has relationship issues of his own after accidentally stabbing his epileptic girlfriend with a fork. The two decide to embark on a roadtrip to the annual Playboy party so that Eugene can confront Cindi—an adventure rife with setbacks, including a vendetta with a network of angry firemen and an encounter with rapper Horsedick.MPEG (sic), played by Craig Robinson of “The Office” fame.Although “Miss March” has its funny moments, most of the humor is trite and stale. The film banks too heavily on the shock value of giving screen time to the corporeal taboo, such as a pair of testicles sans penis. The film’s deus ex machina, which involves a lustful lesbian make-out session, also strikes out. The humor throughout caters specifically to its male audience, but this kind of soft pornography has been done many times before. Even more cringe-worthy is the film’s use of medical conditions like incontinence and epilepsy as a collective crutch for cheap, physical humor. Turns out seizures aren’t that funny, even when they involve failed fellatio.The firemen—only tangentially related to the epilepsy subplot—serve as one of the movie’s few redeeming motifs. In their absurd and relentless pursuit of Tucker and Eugene, they provide a refreshing shtick in the otherwise recycled nature of “Miss March.” Craig Robinson’s performance as Horsedick.MPEG also ultimately succeeds, due to his typically nonchalant delivery and an awkward revelation at the movie’s end.The acting of Cregger and Moore, by contrast, is noticeably contrived. Their stilted words and staging make them appear painfully conscious that they are acting, and the plasticity of their conversations is impossible to overlook. To be sure, there is a patent attempt to flesh out the main characters’ three-dimensionality. Tucker’s secret sexual naïveté, for instance, complicates his otherwise insufferably flat character. But nothing can save either protagonist from the actors’ forced deliveries. Ultimately, Hugh Hefner is the only realistic character in the film, and that isn’t saying much since the man plays himself.Like a gawky teenager lumbering at a school dance, “Miss March” is a film awkwardly unsure of itself. The characters don’t come of age or learn any substantive moral lesson, and the attempt at emotional sincerity feels about as injected and synthetic as the breasts of Hugh’s Playboy bunnies. When removed from their sketch comedy environment, it seems The Whitest Kids U’Know can only deliver a drawn-out lesson of “bros before hos” you can smell from a mile away.

Nicole Sheldon-Desjardins first conceived of a Women’s Day film festival during her time in Cameroon with the Peace Corps. There, she said, International Women’s Day is one of just three holidays—along with Independence Day and Youth Day—celebrated by parades and a complete suspension of school and work. “It was shocking to me that in Cameroon, where there is such inequality,” Sheldon-Desjardins says, “women celebrate in this way.”When she returned to the States in 2006, Sheldon-Desjardins, a director of programs with Hostelling International, decided to combine her passion for film with her interest in women’s issues to establish the Boston International Women’s Day Film Festival. The festival—which ran last week March 5-9—screened 20 films in Boston and Cambridge, primarily at the Brattle Theatre. The films remind viewers of the many trials suffered by women around the world—from the kidnapping and murder of young women by the Nepalese national army to the controversies concerning women’s headscarves in Dubai. The event—presented by Hostelling International USA in conjunction with Women in Film & Video/New England and The United Nations Association of Greater Boston—kicked off its second year with a screening of the new documentary “Patsy Mink: Ahead of the Majority” at the Boston Public Library on March 5.Kimberlee K. Bassford ’99—who wrote, produced, directed and co-edited the documentary—became fascinated by Mink after the former Hawaii Congresswoman’s death in 2002. Bassford discovered then that Mink had not only been the first woman of color in the U.S. Congress but had also co-authored Title IX, the landmark amendment that banned gender discrimination in federally-funded education and sports programs. “It was a great way to look at history differently through the eyes of an Asian-American woman,” Bassford says. Drawing upon hundreds of photos and newspaper clippings from Mink’s relatives and from Library of Congress archives, Bassford traced a life of struggle and perseverance. When Mink was elected in 1965 to the U.S. House of Representatives, one headline read, “Pert and Pretty Patsy Mink has a Lot of Serious Thoughts as She Approaches Her Role in Congress.” This patronizing fascination with the Hawaii native of Japanese descent soon gave way to the pejorative communist label “Patsy Pink,” as she voiced her fierce opposition to the Vietnam War, demanded gender equality, and pushed for increased government spending in education.Her story is little known because, Bassford says, “She wasn’t out to make a name. She wasn’t out for her greed or her ego.” The goal of recognizing oft-ignored contributions made and injustices undergone by women shapes all of the festival’s selections. A collection of short films—screened on March 7 and 8—created a well-rounded and global perspective, balancing the domestic, marital, religious, political and economic challenges faced by women. “Through the Negev” depicts the struggle of Sudanese women and children trying to survive as refugees in Israel despite intense suspicion and distrust against them. “Club Native” reveals how Mohawk women in the Canadian town of Kahnawake face patriarchal norms that force them to marry to preserve “blood purity” while disenfranchising women of mixed heritage. Another film, “The Sari Soldiers,” profiles six Nepalese women on divergent ends of the political, economic and social spectrum during Nepal’s civil war and democratic revolution. The prejudices and sufferings depicted in these films serve to underscore and pay homage to the women’s resilience. They depict sexual violence, poverty, political instability, and community strife, but do not seek to perpetuate the idea of women as helpless victims. About her documentary, Bassford says, “Really it’s a film about the courage to stand up to injustice, about having courage to act on your conscience and to initiate change, and [Patsy Mink is] kind of a way to exemplify that.” Similarly, despite the personal tragedies depicted in the films, Sheldon-Desjardins sees the festival as an inspiration. “Ultimately, the films carry a message of hope and are a testament to the strength of the women portrayed.”

The blossoming of a new European cinema in the decades following the Second World War marked the beginning of a distinct cultural epoch on the continent. The 50s and 60s brought a generation of cinematic geniuses like Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, and Federico Fellini to light, along with a diverse set of styles whose ambition and vision are still tremendously influential. But the future of filmmaking in Europe was not so bright, nor its future so clear, in the last days of the war. By 1945, the national film industries that hadn’t been hijacked for propaganda purposes had been destroyed, and with the continent on the precipice of an economic abyss, nothing seemed more unlikely than a European film renaissance. George C. Marshall and the plan that would bear his name would change all that, however inadvertently.From March 12 to March 19, the Brattle Theatre is showing a series of films funded by and promoting the Marshall Plan in Western Europe in a program called “Selling Democracy, Films of the Marshall Plan: 1948-1953.” The event, organized by curator Sandra P. Schulberg and funded by the Goethe-Institut (a German non-profit cultural institute), features 25 short films constructed around the Marshall Plan’s deployment in Europe. The films range widely in genre and rhetorical strategy, from simple narratives about how the Plan’s programs could improve daily life, to more broadly pedantic lectures on the nascent, but nevertheless looming threat of totalitarianism from the East.“They’re entertaining and witty, and they offer really interesting examples of effective public communication,” Schulberg says. “Examples that can both inspire and educate their audiences at the same time.” Schulberg first became interested in these films when she learned that her father, the late NBC producer Stuart Schulberg, had worked with the European filmmakers who produced the shorts. What she saw in these films was the seed of social change that was not without a modern-day resonance: “The films offer a blueprint for how America, in partnership with so-called ‘aid recipients,’ once approached the same problems we face in Iraq. These films offer a very concrete example of how we managed recovery hand-in-hand with European partners.”Despite the obvious bureaucratic strings, many of these films are rather charming. “The Story of Koula,” targeted at audiences from rural Greek farmlands, tells the story of a farm boy’s dream: to own a donkey. His poor family is only able to fulfill the boy’s desire by signing up for aid from the Marshall Plan. Koula, a mule shipped in from the American South, bristles with European stereotypes about Americans; he’s young, wild, and virtually untamable, but with a little affection from the boy and help from a local donkey, he becomes an invaluable asset to the farm. “I read [“The Story of Koula”] as the quintessential metaphor for what made the Marshall Plan work so well,” Schulberg says. “You have this powerful mule that doesn’t really function until it’s yolked to a little donkey that knows the route.” For modern audiences, it may smack of the sentimental, but for a generation whose national will had all but dissolved, this cinema of hope was more than welcome. “There was constant negotiation and improvising on a basic framework that made [the Plan] very alive and very pragmatic,” Schulberg says.“It’s cool that we get to see them projected in the way that the people experienced at the time,” says Ned R. Hinkle, the Creative Director of the Brattle. These short films were usually shown preceding features in European movie theaters.“The idea behind the films—that they should not be done by Americans but by European directors—was psychologically extremely important,” says Detlef M. Gericke-Schoenhagen, the new director of Boston’s Goethe-Institut. Gericke-Schoenhagen was formerly Head of the Film Department at the Goethe-Institut’s headquarters in Munich, where he supervised a collection of over 4,000 films. He believes that the mission behind these films has important implications for contemporary international community building and cooperation: “When I was abroad, I got so many ideas from Africa, from Afghanistan, and the Near East, to create film programs that help deal with the problems in those regions.”The Marshall Plan films had the collective effect of a quiet reawakening of the European will to create cinema. “When a road-show comes to town to screen a film program, whether its propaganda or not, its going to reestablish an interest in movies that may have been lost during the war—that was quelled either by being at war or occupied by another country,” Hinkle says. “These films are about reconstruction; they’re about winning hearts and minds.”—Staff writer Ryan J.

This Saturday, the Asian American Dance Troupe celebrates the diversity of Asian culture with its annual collective show, Eastbound. From Korean hip-hop to imperial dance and interpretations of children’s books, Eastbound will feature a diverse array of vibrant performances. AADT co-captain, Jieliang Hao ’11, discusses the development of AADT and how this year’s show reflects the mission of this organization. The Harvard Crimson (THC): What makes this year’s Eastbound performance so special? Jieliang Hao (JH): Every year we improve a lot based on past years. This year we managed to attract outside choreographers—someone from Expressions [Dance Company], as well as a South Asian choreographer. Since this is the seniors’ last performance, they are going all out. We also have a lot of incoming freshman that are really talented. The spirit is great this year. In the program, we have a huge variety of tempos, different styles and different feels, and some of the performances are even humorous. THC: Why should people go to Eastbound this weekend? JH: A lot of people have misconceptions of what Asian dance is like; it is so much more than just soft, flowy, slow dance. Chinese dance, for example, has many different styles, just like the many different Chinese cultures.We have the resources so that we can congregate all of our talent into one show. I can promise that when you go, you will see a lot that you have never seen before. Last year, we had a Mongolian dance with chopsticks, performed by all girls, even though it was a very masculine dance. Several people in the audience came up to us after to say how unexpected the dance was. It’s good entertainment because Asian dance is mostly for presentation. Imperial dance especially is really about the show, the style, and the choreography. It’s very theatrical. THC: One of the dances in the show is called Peach Princesses. Where did the inspiration for this name come from? JH: It’s from a really famous Chinese children’s book, called “Journeys from the West.” People nowadays, when they interpret it, get a lot of secret messages out of it. But I would bet that every Chinese person knows this story. Basically, there is a garden in heaven, and if you eat the peaches from the trees in the garden you can live a thousand years more. The dancers are the protectors of the peach trees. THC: What is the highlight of this year’s show? JH: I just went to the dress rehearsal yesterday, and I was blown away by how hard everyone worked. I couldn’t pick out just one or two acts. We have very graceful, soft pieces, and we have Korean hip-hop, with the song Purpleline, as well as an imperial fan dance.  THC: Which performance in this year’s show do you think exemplifies the mission of AADT the best? JH: The mission of AADT is to have fun. It doesn’t matter if you have or have not danced before. It’s really about fun and dance, because we all love to dance. All the dances this year exemplify this. They are all very varied in terms of seniority and style. We try to mix up people who have danced before and people who haven’t.

The nature of history, adolescent angst, and pedophilia—the themes of the play “The History Boys” by English playwright Alan Bennett—will always attract varying interpretations. “One of the biggest things that frustrates me is that people summarize it as a humorous schoolboy comedy,” says Mia P. Walker ’10, director of the show’s latest incarnation opening tonight at the Loeb Ex. Walker, who is also a Crimson Arts writer, is seeking to draw out the play’s more outrageous and taboo themes—an attempt to substantiate this “schoolboy comedy” and create an engaging and moving performance.In a play that focuses so much on the shifting and ambiguous teacher-student relationship, using a cast of just college students poses a challenge, with no visual differentiation between master and student. For Walker, however, this is part of the attraction of putting on the show. “This is a story that needs to be told, and it needs to be done by a younger group,” she says. “I think it’s really fascinating to see what happens when you have college students playing all the characters, because then it’s just this messed up world where it doesn’t matter if you’re an adult or you’re 18 years old. You’re thinking about sex, you’re thinking about your life, and you’re thinking about how we’re all dying.”Because it displays the universal and not always rosy interests of the characters, regardless of age and life experience, “The History Boys” is not always a comfortable viewing experience. “All the characters in the play have a dark side to them that, when it comes out, is a little jarring,” says Sean Delal, a junior at Emerson who plays the cynical new teacher Irwin.Walker offers a similarly dark interpretation of the play’s meaning. “The major themes of the play for me are the fear of disappearing and not making history and the crazy things that people do to not disappear,” she says.In this attempt to make history, the characters of the play go through a multitude of formative experiences. The tension between Irwin’s new methods of teaching and the more idealistic notions about education of his older counterpart, Hector, provide the backbone of the show. However, the play holds back from judging exactly which is correct, particularly as both characters are so flawed.Ilan J. Caplan ’10, who plays Hector, sees his character as one that is respected by many in the play, but he is as dark and contradictory as the rest. “The questions that surround him add to his darkness,” he says. “He comes out as having the right approach in a lot of ways, but I’m not sure that it’s argued that it’s a moral approach.”This refusal to judge what is morally correct is, for Walker, another of the play’s key attractions. “My ideal situation would be people walking out of the theatre thinking, ‘Who do I align with?’” she says. As for the attitude of the play, she says “It’s not quite idealism, it’s not quite this shock value skepticism. It’s something else that, unfortunately, society deems as taboo.”This chaotic approach to morality will be reflected in the similarly chaotic setting of the play. For a play that has been successful in the London West End, Broadway, and as a movie, the decision to stage it in the intimate Loeb Ex may seem a little strange. “[The theatre may seem] chaotic and crowded,” Walker says, but “the boys themselves… test the notion of what it means to sit in seats and listen to a teacher. They’re very active, so there’s no reason why this play needs to be done like classroom, teacher, and audience in a proscenium. I think it’s more of an interactive piece.” Caplan agrees that the play deserves this kind of intimate setting. “It’s written to be played around with,” he said. “The script has a very strong experimental nature to it.”In experimenting with “The History Boys” and forming their own distinct version of it, the cast and crew of this new production hope that thetw. For Walker, who gave up a chance to study abroad in Paris this semester in favor of directing this play, it will certainly be a very personal experience. “This is our ‘History Boys,’” she says. “If it was any other way I think Bennett would be upset.”—Staff Writer Chris R. Kingston can be reached at kingston@fas.harvard.edu.

For eight weeks starting April 20, supermarkets will be stocked with Pepsi and Mountain Dew Throwback. This limited-edition retro soda will be made with “real sugar” to give consumers a taste of the flavor of the 60s and 70s, before high-fructose corn syrup replaced cane sugar in 1984. From the way websites have pounced on this bit of pop trivia, you’d think this soda is the solution to obesity. However, the truth is that while the halo of “pure cane sugar” may help Americans sleep at night, it’s not going to do anything for our waistlines.Two months before the retro drink unveiling—before Pepsi had even issued an official press release—blogs and online news sites had already covered every imaginable detail of the “story.” BevReview.com, a website devoted exclusively to relaying news about the beverage industry, was, unsurprisingly, the leading source of information of the unfolding soda saga. The website featured a frequently asked questions section, pictures of unused prototype labels, and hypertext links to articles about other real sugar sodas.  Just in case an 800-word essay speculating bottle design had left anything out, the blogger reminded the reader, “As always, keep your browser pointing here at BevReview.com for further updates… and don’t forget to follow us on Twitter to say informed!” I couldn’t bring myself to keep reading. It could have been, perhaps, that I was tired of obsessive food babble. Or maybe because I don’t like soda, not even a bit. But I think the most likely explanation for why I was bitter was that this forced me to open an account on Twitter. Seriously, though: a world where a Twitter feed unironically exists to unironically document the eight-week release of an oxymoron—natural soda—is a world where people seem to have lost all perspective. Though BevReview was covering the Pepsi story like television stations cover approaching hurricanes, no one seemed to notice that switching back to “real sugar,” though a nice effort, is a gesture ultimately as empty as the calories in the soda itself—cane and corn alike. Instead of offering six different kinds of Pepsi or 15 different articles about each kind, we should be figuring out a way to make soda less a part of our lives. Don’t get me wrong. I appreciate that the soda industry is finally responding to the critical literature on high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Food writer Michael Pollen calls HFCS the “culprit in the nation’s obesity epidemic,” but the Corn Refiners Association has been airing commercials recently to dispel this myth. (You can find them on YouTube. They’re worth watching.) Either way, switching to a more conscious consumption of sugar is unquestionably a good thing. The release of Pepsi Throwback, following in the limited-run tradition of Pepsi Raw released last year in the UK, is a sign that Pollen’s words have made it to the CEO’s ears and, probably, wallet. The recent move to permanently remove HFCS from soft drinks is even more promising. Last year, Red Bull unveiled “Simply Cola,” their natural-sugar only soda. Snapple recently announced that they’ll be losing HFCS in favor of natural sugar. And just last week Pepsi announced that “Pepsi Natural,” will permanently populate shelves within the next few weeks. All this is a sharp reversal of the mindless use of high-fructose corn syrup that has been the case in this country since 1970. This movement also promises to be at least a little bit greener. The energy necessary to turn corn into corn syrup leaves a huge carbon footprint. According to Chloe Frank ’09, author of “A Controversial Sweetener: The Hoopla over High Fructose Corn Syrup in America,” HFCS is made by milling corn into cornstarch. The cornstarch is then broken down into glucose, and the chains of glucose molecules—thanks to added enzymes—break down to yield hyper-sweetened syrup. All of this manufacturing drastically increases the amount of resources consumed and the pollutants produced. Natural sugar, by definition, requires a lot less refining. Regardless, all this could just be a whole bunch of wasted energy. Think about it: in an attempt to be healthy, instead of pulling soda, we’re just adding new options to the shelves. For eight weeks between April and June, there will be at least seven different kinds of Pepsi on the market: Pepsi Natural, Pepsi throwback, regular Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Caffeine-free Pepsi, and Kosher Pepsi. I can’t blame the soda companies though. They’re responding to consumer demand by offering “natural sugar” alternatives to their product.The real problem is that in all the brouhaha about inverted cane sugar vs. beet sugar, people seem to be forgetting that, whether soda is made with HFCS or pure cane sugar, soda is still empty calories.  Even if the body processes the two differently, the difference of a few fructose molecules is not going to reverse the trend of American obesity. It’s up to consumers, and, more importantly, the food writing community to call attention to the fact that this solution is merely a glossy bandage. It’s great that we’re finally talking about food issues, but I don’t think this is at all what Michael Pollen had in mind when he urged Americans to care more about what they put in their bodies. Nothing could be further from his motto of “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants,” than the frequently asked questions section of BevReview.com where they ask a spokesperson from Pepsi whether the logo of throwback will have the 70s globe design or the swirly blue font. We’ve seen that food companies respond to journalistic pressure (McDonalds no longer offers supersized stuff), so we need to be more careful about what we draw our attention to, what we ask for, and what we celebrate. Right now, though the intentions are good, the energy, I’m afraid, is completely misdirected.—Staff Writer Rebecca A. Cooper can be reached at cooper3@fas.harvard.edu.

Misa Kuranaga may be a tiny little thing, but she is an absolute spitfire. At 10 years old, she was personally invited by legendary director of Russia’s Bolshoi Ballet, Yuri Grigorovich, to come perform at the star-studded Moscow International Ballet Competition Gala Performance. After winning a Scholarship at the famed Prix de Lausanne, she went on to study at the School of American Ballet (SAB) and win her own gold medal at the Moscow International Ballet Competition eight years later. After joining the Boston Ballet in 2003, Kuranaga has risen up through the ranks and was last week promoted to the company’s highest rank, Principal, in the midst of its “Jewels” run. One of Boston’s most beloved dancers, she is regularly invited to guest internationally, and as a homecoming of sorts, participated in SAB’s 75th anniversary gala performance with the New York City Ballet (NYCB) several weeks ago, an experience she calls the “highlight” of her year. She recently sat down with The Harvard Crimson to tell us more about her career as a ballerina.    The Harvard Crimson (THC): Tell me about your transition from Japan to New York, before Boston.Misa Kuranaga (MK): It was a little bit of a shock. It was definitely different. My training in Japan was very classical. Of course I knew [Balanchine’s, a famous choreographer’s] work, like Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux, Theme and Variations, the big stuff, but I had no idea how it should look, since I had never seen NYCB. I went first to San Francisco as an apprentice, and I got to learn “Rubies” and the “Emeralds corps” from Jewels, but I didn’t know how to be big, I didn’t know how to be dynamic, in the Balanchine way. THC: How instrumental was the SAB in molding you into the versatile dancer that you are today?MK: One of the teachers at San Francisco said to me, “You know, if you don’t know how to dance Balanchine, you will not get a job in this country. You will not survive, so you really have to change.” I decided to go to SAB to get the real training, and that was just a blessing. It changed me so much, how to use my feet, my turnout, the quickness, everything, and that was something that I needed at that point. I was really lucky that I didn’t get a job at first, because I really sat down and said, “I have to retrain myself.” When the teachers [at SAB] saw me, they probably thought, “Oh god, this girl is impossible.” They said “Ok, Misa, you really have to do this, and change that, you need to put the hair up and away,” I had bangs, and I just listened to them every day, and I tried to do what they said. I learned a lot from Suki [Schorer] and Suzy [Pilarre]. Suki used to call me “Sushi,” like “Miso, sushi!”THC: Ballet competitions have played such an important role in your career—how did you approach them? MK: I don’t think competitions are necessary, but for my life, they were. When you have this strong goal you have to work towards, you improve so much more. So many people think of a competition as competing with other people and being better: better extensions, more pirouettes, everything “more.” But to me a competition is like a gala. You show yourself, and you go out there, and you express yourself as you. That’s my biggest goal. Doing big full-length classical ballets, or not getting enough rehearsal for Balanchine, it’s almost more nerve-wrecking. But [in competition] you have a choice to be nervous or not to be, to compete with other people or not to. You always have control, and that’s important to me.THC: What is the rehearsal process like for you at Boston Ballet?MK: Everything depends on what you’re doing, how close to the performance it is. Sometimes I have to dance for six hours. That’s hard. I think the learning process is the hardest. You have to be standing and learning all day, so it’s a lot of brainwork. When I’m working on Balanchine, the stagers and ballet masters tell me, for example, “Use your hips more,” but I know now what the Balanchine ballets should look like, I have the vision, the image. THC: What is your work and thought process like when you prepare roles?MK: For Jewels, I watched Patricia McBride on tape. I usually watch it a couple of times so that I can have some idea of how the original cast did it and try to be as close to it as I can, but also bring some of myself into it. I used to be crazy about videos, watching them all the time. I’ve gotten to be a little bit better at that. When I did the lead in La Fille Mal Gardée, I had to watch the Royal Ballet [of London] tape every day. Every day. And I got to say, “Oh, I don’t like that,” or “I love that. Im going to take that.”THC: What are your future plans?MK: I definitely want to do all the classical ballets, and my dream role, Juliet. And I want to do [MacMillan’s] Manon… and John Neumeier’s Lady of the Camellias. So I have all these dream roles I want to do, and I would love to guest with NYCB again if I had the chance. I have been doing more galas in Japan, and maybe I will go to Europe. I’m thinking of projects.THC: Favorite ice cream flavor?MK: Green tea ice cream. And mango sorbet. I actually put that on my Facebook page today.

In a week, hundreds of Harvard students will depart Cambridge for locales far and wide during spring recess. Some will fly to the sunny Caribbean while others head for home or hop across the pond to Europe. But regardless of where they’re going, students may benefit from the Undergraduate Council’s recent decision to subsidize a new student venture, Get Out of Cambridge. 
The start-up, founded by two Harvard students, offers discounted prices on airfares and taxis to and from Logan Airport and has also promised to bring a ride-sharing feature to campus. The site’s owners claim that they “will continue to expand our product and service offerings until GetOutOfCambridge.com serves as the one-stop shop for traveling students.” This is a worthy goal, even if the organization is a for-profit enterprise. The new website is especially useful for students, who usually travel with strict budget constraints. 
But the UC’s decision to fund this promising business has been met with considerable controversy. Some UC members have voiced opposition to the idea of the council funding for-profit businesses; others have objected that the recent grant is not part of the council’s mandate to improve student life at Harvard. These objections, while well intentioned, are undermined by the simple fact that Get Out of Cambridge provides a much-needed service that has heretofore not existed on campus and therefore deserves support from the larger undergraduate community. Additionally, since the UC was given a stake in the business in return for its support, it may actually recoup its original investment, allowing it to give more grants to other student groups.
In general, we encourage the UC to explore nontraditional methods of helping students achieve their goals, no matter the situation. In particular, funding student businesses may help to fill the gaps left by College administrators and other student organizations, which may not be able to account for all the needs of the student body. 
Of course, there are always risks involved in funding for-profit firms. The UC should be cautious when funding a student business and ensure that these enterprises will provide a clear benefit to all Harvard students. We urge the council to carefully scrutinize any and all applications from student-run businesses and make sure that the grants provided by the UC will benefit all students equally. Nevertheless, we are confident that, in the case of Get Out of Cambridge, the UC has made the right decision.

This morning, hate comes to Cambridge. According to their offensively titled website, the Westboro Baptist Church will be protesting Cambridge Rindge and Latin’s acceptance of homosexuality before moving on to the air force base and high school in Lexington, Mass., and capping off their packed day with a protest in Reading, Mass. The daylong protest spree is inspired by Reading Memorial High School’s staging of the Laramie Project, a play depicting the horrors of hate crimes against homosexuals.The Westboro Baptist Church is a Topeka, Kansas, based group that loosely uses religious principles to justify a universally offensive agenda of hate. To further this agenda, they have taken to protesting at high schools, Elton John concerts, and even at the funerals of our soldiers. They typically carry banners with offensive anti-homosexual slogans and claim that the attacks of 9/11 and the casualties in the Iraq War were punishment for America’s acceptance of gay rights. Their highly objectionable tactics have largely been met with mockery, disdain, and vocal opposition. The Westboro Baptist Church has essentially succeeded in offending rational people at every point on the political spectrum. Given that the WBC is little other than a marginal group with no real agenda or goal besides the spread of hate, it is dismaying that their spiteful rhetoric will be present at Cambridge Rindge and Latin.The upside to their ignorance and spite is the validation that it lends to the principles of free speech. The vocal and offensive rhetoric of this small group is so clearly preposterous, absurd, and uninformed that they act as the very best argument against themselves. Though they may have little societal value, they affirm the necessity of an open marketplace of ideas and show that the self-regulation of such a market can actually work. Facebook.com groups organizing counter-protests for today sprang up with haste. The group for the counter-protest in Lexington has over 100 attendees. These counter-protests will act as the rational response to the potent hatred of the WBC. Of course, residents of Cambridge will, and fully should, get angry over the spite and hate spewed from this ignorant group. Maybe the best response, though, is to simply ignore them. These protests are enough to make any reasonable person ill, but no one can demonstrate the ignorance of the Westboro Baptist Church better than the Westboro Baptist Church can.

I’ve experienced few things more nerve-wracking than the minutes I spent awaiting the results of a rapid HIV test. I felt confident that I’d test negative, but getting tested for HIV is something you’re “supposed” to do if you’re young and sexually active. “Better safe than sorry,” is the mantra we’re trained to repeat before taking a stranger’s (literal or figurative) candy.
But I was still nervous, and thankful for the company of a counselor as I swabbed my gums and anticipated my results at a public health clinic in Illinois. I was impressed by his frankness; his honesty put me at ease. As we waited, he asked questions about my habits and knowledge of sex that were almost refreshing in their intrusiveness. We talked about things I had thought about before (did I know that HIV was more easily transmitted via anal sex?), but some topics had never even crossed my mind (how could HIV be transmitted from woman to woman?).
As we talked, I grew more and more convinced that 20 minutes of “HIV 101” was probably a better use of my time than Expos 20 and seven semesters of the Core combined. I know a female senior at Harvard who didn’t know how many “holes” a woman had until this year (and that’s a serious hole in one’s general education). After talking for about half an hour, a timer buzzed on the test and my counselor smiled. “Negative!” he announced, and I thanked him, standing up to leave.
“One more thing, Emma,” he said to me, gravely. “Men are dogs. You might think you have one on a short leash, but that doesn’t mean he’s not sniffing around other places. It’s always better to wrap it up.” He passed me a paper bag full of condoms.
Thanks? What had begun as a frank conversation about sex between two adults had quickly degenerated into something presumptuous and vaguely sexist. His brutally honest language concerning sex—discharge, lubricants: words that demystify and de-stigmatize the realities of intercourse—was betrayed by this metaphorical notion of protection. His instructions to “wrap it up” because my canine lover could be barking up another tree may have been nothing more than a misguided attempt to speak in 20-something vernacular, but it reveals a more disturbing mode of approaching heterosexuality.
Often, women in the popular media—from a group of young women in MTV’s The City bonding over their boyfriends’ infidelity to Miley Cyrus taking revenge on her friend’s cheating Romeo in a TV episode—connect with over their two-timing male counterparts. This trend feels empowering, but it is insincere to posture as honest and informative regarding sexuality before making sweeping generalizations about female vulnerability and male barbarity. It should go without saying that some men take advantage of their partners. But one cheating boyfriend is just that—one guy with issues—and an individual who sniffs elsewhere does not signify a universal female helplessness. 
Framing safe heterosexual intercourse in the language of “men are dogs—protect yourself!” constructs a hypothetical, collective female vulnerability that deprives women of agency in their sexual encounters. Rather than empowering women, it establishes a paradigm in which women are victims of men’s animalistic urges. In reality, men are not the sole indulgers in promiscuity. This characterization assumes that men are infidels and that women are their perpetual victims, when this is by no means a universal truth. Forced sexual encounters are tragic occurrences that will erode sexual equality as long as they persist, but to establish the lying, cheating beau as the norm in sexual relationships is regressive and destructive. It instills a resignation that a dishonest scoundrel is all a heterosexual woman should hope for, when, in reality, any woman who writes off all men in one fell swoop is probably a bit of a dog herself.
I wondered if this counselor’s antiquated view of sexuality could be attributed to provincialism. But this mischaracterization did not arise from simply being retrograde, but from adhering to a false progressivism. This was a man who advised me not to brush my teeth before performing oral sex, since tiny lacerations in the mouth can increase chances of transmitting HIV—clearly, we were having a no-holds-barred conversation. He was either under the impression that he was talking to the sort of feminist who would understand that he was a chill, trustworthy dude-turned-counselor who realized the shortcomings of his own sex or thought he was empowering me to protect myself.
The situation was disappointing because I had appreciated this counselor’s candor and valued his openness to sexual habits and preferences. Unfortunately, attempts at sexual honesty backfire when they resort to reductive characterizations of gender niches. I would have been satisfied with a clear HIV test, a bag of condoms, and a simple, professional goodbye. In attempts to paint sex as something to be feared—and men as untrustworthy—the least likely people can find themselves in the doghouse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conventional wisdom says globalization is grinding to a halt. Supposedly, the recession means free trade is down, the worldwide gambit is over, and open markets lost: Protectionism is up, isolation is on the onset, interventionist states won, and we’re spiraling into a 1930s-style “save-yourself” vortex. In the past few weeks, two articles in the most popular globalization-advocacy journal—The Economist—have specifically bemoaned the coming tide of “global disintegration” and the specter of worldwide “economic nationalism.”
First off, everybody needs to cool it: Globalization is not going anywhere anytime soon. Second, nationalism never departed. The claim that countries have been growing over the past 25 years because of pure market deregulation across the board is false. The idea of the “unfettered market” is nothing but a wild myth.
Since World War II—even during the supposed libertarian love-fest and free-market free-for-all of the 1980s—states have invested in their people as well as forsaken integration and cooperation when prudent. Market intervention has always been part of the globalization process. But, too often, the market is viewed as a multilateral institution and the state as a pesky force of isolationism. Despite this false perception, we should continue to see global cooperation and so-called “nationalistic” government action in tandem for the foreseeable future. They’re not mutually exclusive.
Over the past two decades, much of the world profited from peace, low inflation, and the bringing of billions of people (mostly the emerging middle classes in India, China, and Brazil) into the economic fold. Much of the world also suffered: Globalization has not always encouraged confidence and enhanced security for everyone. “Free trade” too often means tariffs on the primary exports of developing countries. “Development assistance” too often means developing economies must submit to rules that prohibit or hinder investment in their own infrastructure and people—the kind of investment responsible for the United States’s own miraculous growth in the 19th century. The national interests of developed countries have shaped the playing field from the start.
All countries are guilty of self interest, no doubt. Emerging markets have responded to an uneven playing field with their own brand of “economic nationalism.” Indeed, Harvard economics professor Ken Rogoff notes that India’s comparatively “stringent restrictions on international capital flows” saved it from the brunt of the recession. The point is that state intervention and national interests have been complicated through globalization, not erased.
Economic nationalism and state intervention can be good or bad, smart or dumb, and in the coming years we need to be pragmatic and distinguish.  Globalization proponents—especially those who support the phenomenon on the condition that it’s better managed—have nothing to fear from economic nationalism and state intervention per se. The economic interconnectedness of the world is not disappearing, and we will need to address most problems collectively. But this time we need to be more careful not to put all of our eggs in one basket. Many forms of economic nationalism can help with that.
Good forms of state intervention include stricter regulation for banks, especially on the part of the developed world. Banks have to be stopped from taking irresponsible risks overseas, especially when things are good and risk looks tasty. Leverage must be capped. Some firms must be nationalized. Another good form, especially for developing countries, is job creation through investment in local infrastructure. Ineffective forms of nationalism include tariffs on the primary exports of developing countries, arbitrary trade disruption out of fear, and stricter immigration laws at a time when immigrants are hurting most.
Although it’s true that many kinds of protectionism would at this point be detrimental, others might not be. Global trade is down substantially, and closing economies is not the answer for anyone, but some protectionist measures are necessary to sell international cooperation to people in developed countries (see the “Buy American” clause, which is no Smoot-Hawley tariff).   
State regulation, protection, and intervention do not necessarily mean economic isolation from the rest of the world. But, when faced with a choice, we should certainly favor regulation over protectionism. If strong global regulation doesn’t happen, then the most sensible thing for many countries will be to shelter themselves from the rest of the world.
And yet, although we need stronger international regulatory institutions, especially for finance, the onus for creating those is on national governments of the developed world (more nationalism). Right now, international institutions are paradoxically both indispensable and ineffective. They can’t set up the new architecture. Strong states must lead the way by regulating at home, albeit hopefully with multilateral principles in mind.
The crisis has so far led to unprecedented international cooperation. Three weeks from now, the G-20 will meet to brainstorm some solutions to the recession. There, the powers must decide how to balance the market and the state intervention in many different cases. They will undoubtedly recognize that “economic nationalism” has always been under the surface of globalization, implement the good aspects of state intervention and protection, and steer clear of the others.

Look at our last names. All right, welcome
back to this paragraph. You know what kind of guys we are. We probably slick our hair back and eat spaghetti at home EVERY NIGHT. “Mamma mia,” right? Looks like we just found a bigot.
But you are not the only bigot in the history of this soiled university. This university was built by people who hate people like us. Some people say things change, but Sacco and Vanzetti still sounds a lot like Chiappini and Bilotti to us. Oh, we’ve heard the jokes: “Hey, Linguini Breath,” they say, “are you going to put some Communion hosts on your host-eroni pizza?” Sadly, we do not cry marinara sauce, but real human tears.
We took a break from people hurling meatballs at us in the dining hall to bring you this column. We have all heard about the controversial mascots: the Washington
Redskins, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Bears (yeah, we’re throwing up right now too). But you probably neglect abuses when they’re close to home—domestic abuses, we’ll call them. You just want to go through life neglecting the pile of stegosaurus manure in your own backyard. That’s right: The Harvard Crimson. [1] “But wait!” you snivel. “That’s not even a mascot! That’s just a color!” Yeah, right, and Chris Brown is just Usher with an edge.
When you attend your 1.7 football games a year, you are probably delighted by the antics of the biggest bigot of them all—the faux John Harvard who prances around, flaunting his hatred of southern Europeans and their culture. He wants you to love him, but he doesn’t want you to think about how disgusted he is that there are Harvard students in the stands whose surnames end in vowels, and not vowels that are only sometimes vowels (so-called “weekend warrior” vowels), but work-a-day, knock-around vowels, the kinds of vowels that built this country.
Ol’ Jack Harvard and his Puritan scumbag brosephs came to this country to get away from people like us and have tried to keep us out ever since. NEWS FLASH: we’re back! Assholes. We brought our swarthy demeanor and our bocce balls. Get used to it. To these ol’ bluebloods, anyone who doesn’t get a boner at the mention of Plymouth Rock doesn’t belong in this country. NEWS FLASH: This is a melting pot, or a salad, or a taco salad, or a Cobb salad, or a lobster bisque with a light garnish—depending on your culinary and ideological persuasions.
However, Italians don’t just tear things down without a plan. We build them up, so they can lean over due to soil erosion. We have substantive ideas, and we were humble enough to scrap those that only honored our culture: Vespas, the Pope, “The Lizzie McGuire Movie,” Rocky Marciano/Rocky of “Rocky” fame, and Chef Boyardee. Even after discarding those, we have some great ideas that will represent Harvard much better than the Orange reactionary we currently have.
The Harvard Clocks: Nothing is more scary to Harvard students and other Ivy Leaguers than Time.
The Harvard Viswanathans: We didn’t steal your playbook, we “internalized” it. Why mess with success?
The Harvard Salem the Cats: Sassy, classy, and @fassy.
The Harvard Assholes on Parade: That’s about all you are. Next joke. I said, NEXT JOKE.
The Harvard New York Liberty: Combining
the discipline of Rebecca Lobo, the brand recognition of Sheryl Swoopes, the sound fundamentals of Diana Taurasi, and the unbridled passion of Chamique Holdsclaw, these troops of Our Queen Drew Faust will blow through opposing dudes.
The Harvard Registrars: Kane brings the pain! [2]
The Harvard Shia LaBeoufs: Watch out for this one. He’s up and coming.
The Harvard Facebooks: Our only source of human interaction. We’ll poke you where it hurts.
The Harvard Mustangs: Vroom, vroom [Anti-lock brakes noise].
The Harvard UHS Physician Assistants: Malpractice or your money back. Co-sponsored by Room 13 and the Kevorkian
Institute for the Advancement of Terminal Illness.
The Harvard Rebels: We know how to rebel. We come in here wanting to be doctors and work for NGOs, but we rebel and become I-bankers. You can try and kill us, but we have no souls.
The Harvard Israelis: Just kidding, though we dare Alan Dershowitz to debate us.
Real Americans are ready to move past these pasta and anti-pasta politics. Remember our great Italian-American heroes: Giorgio Washingtino, Silvio Berlusconi, Giovanni Adamsi, and Alexandro Hamiltini. If they were on our campus
today, they would twirl their large handlebar mustaches and say, “Send your votes for Harvard’s new mascot, along with pictures of your ‘figure,’ to prestigeandmobility@gmail.com!” [3]
[1] The nickname, not the paper, but yeah, the paper too.
[2] By “pain,” we mean “fascism”.
[3] We’re hoping for a total of nine breasts.

Most Sunday mornings, the first thing I do is frantically check my phone and scroll through my history from the night before to discover who I textually harassed. That’s right, textually harassed. I admit that I am, like so many others out there, a textual harasser. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop. I’ve tried erasing certain guys’ numbers
from my phone or even not having my phone with me all night, but I always end up writing some sloppy, embarrassing
message to some random dude, which never results in anything but me falling
asleep alone, phone in hand.
This sounds pretty sad, I know, and I used to resent this self-destructive behavior, wallowing in post-text shame. But after three years in college, I’ve learned to embrace it. In fact, I’m proud to be a textual harasser. In my opinion, a little love or lust note never hurt anyone.
Furthermore, why not just sack up and go out on a limb to get what you want? The worst thing that can happen is that you don’t get a response, but who cares? At least you tried. Furthermore, the victims ask for it, and deep down, I know they love it. Who doesn’t enjoy getting a 4:00 a.m. invite to “come snuggle?” They just don’t have the balls to text you themselves—at least that’s what I keep telling myself. Thank god I can erase my phone history.

Sometimes you’re hanging out just pongin’ in Mather, or kickin’ it old school with a Steel Reserve from Louie’s private stock, or hitting up the gym bench pressin’ like a bandit, (kicked it up to 90lbs this week, no big deal) and you get that text from a special someone we all know so well: “yoyoyo whut u up 2 :-).”
Now I know you’re saying
“dude go for it—she’s all up ons!” But hear me out. When you’re chilling in the bro-zone, the LAST thing you want is the added pressure of the coquetteishly ambiguous late-night text or in my case, the three or four that inevitably roll in as the evening matures. Yeah you know what I’m talkin’ about! It’s like, how do I respond to that? I got too many demands, ladiez, to spend my time navigating that mine-field of mixed signals. So what’s up?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States must increase troop levels in Afghanistan, help limit the country’s drug cultivation, and train and equip the nation’s armed forces, the nation’s ambassador to the United States said at a JFK Jr. Forum event last night.Ambassador Said T. Jawad said the troubled Middle-Eastern nation—which became a focus of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts following the September 11 attacks—has struggled to rebuild, as the United States shifted its resources toward Iraq.“State building became uncoordinated,” Jawad said. “The building of the police force was limited, and the judicial system didn’t receive the attention it deserved.”“In Afghanistan we did what we could,” he said in reference to rebuilding and anti-terrorism efforts. “In Iraq we did what we must.”Jawad’s remarks come as President Barack Obama’s nascent administration has signalled an intention to increase its focus on the nation.The ambassador outlined a series of steps he hoped the Afghan government could implement with U.S. support, including more troops, fighting narcotics growth, and starting negotiations with the Taliban, the terrorist organization that ran Afghanistan prior to the U.S. invasion.Jawad also said Afghanistan needed better trained and equipped armed forces to maintain domestic order, though he expressed concerns that funding for military training could end up aiding warlords and narco-traffickers if not carefully targeted.Negotiating with the Taliban, a group that continues to engage in terrorist activities, was another key plank of Jawad’s platform.Jawad said the government could successfully fight the Taliban’s influence by winning over its impoverished members, many of whom subsist on less than $300 a day—a figure the government could easily double. The nation’s thriving opium trade, which Jawad said funded many terrorists efforts, must also be curtailed through providing alternative forms of agriculture such as pomegranates. Jawad added that this approach would be more successful than a policy of eradication, which he said would be unrealistic.Though Afghanistan still faces major problems, Jawad said assistance from the United States has proved crucial in improving life there since the Taliban’s ouster. But he added future improvements rely just as heavily on U.S. support. “Success of [this] newest strategy depends on how much resources they can allocate,” he said.

Despite the effects of the financial crisis on the University, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt said the school has no plans to cut funding for any of its programs.Brandt said, however, that GSAS administrators have made modest modifications to the school’s administrative budget upon the request of Michael D. Smith, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Smith has asked all departments for 10 to 15 percent budget cuts in order to meet the more than $100 million shortfall across FAS in the next fiscal year.“This is an exercise that Dean Smith is asking all administrative units in FAS to participate in,” Brandt said. “The character of this economic crisis is so global and universal that resources of every type have been affected.”  Measures that administrators have taken thus far include reducing their catering budgets and leaving certain administrative positions in their office unfilled.“We’ll be able to reach Dean Smith’s goal for the administrative budget,” Brandt said.In addition, instead of cutting back on program funding, the school plans to simply offer admission to fewer students—while keeping class size constant—in order to ensure that over-yields do not occur.“We realized that we would need to be very cautious with the size of the graduate school in the coming year,” Brandt said, adding that the admissions committee has decreased its accepted applicant pool 9 percent.After accepting 660 Ph.D. students last fall, GSAS will only admit around 600 this year, though the number of applicants to the school’s Ph.D. programs rose by approximately 12 percent this year. Yet in spite of the fiscal crisis, Dean Smith, President Drew G. Faust, and GSAS administrative officials said that they are committed to maintaining their support for the University’s graduate students, whom the University admits on a need-blind basis.“We thought it was crucial to assure students who were already here that their fellowships would be absolutely guaranteed,” Brandt said, adding that GSAS guarantees every doctoral student a 5-year financial support package.In addition, although GSAS plans to effectively shrink its admission pool, Brandt said that current and prospective Ph.D. students in all programs would enjoy a slight stipend increase to ensure that they are able to maintain their fellowships.—Staff writer Marianna N.

President Drew G. Faust is $50,000 wealthier after her new book won an award from the New York Historical Society last Wednesday. Louise Mirrer, CEO and President of the New York Historical Society, offered many reasons for the selection of Faust’s book, ‘This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War.’“It is a great book,” Mirrer said, “a fascinating book.”According to her, Faust’s book stood out among the other finalists’.“It is a very different book,” Mirrer said, adding that it deals with a moment in the nation’s history with sweeping changes.The book is about the impact of death and suffering on the nation’s psyche during the Civil War. Mirrer said the book depicted “a juncture in time where something different happened.”The Society was thrilled to be giving this award to such a distinguished historian and to the president of such a distinguished university, Mirrer said.She also added that the Society mainly receives entries for the award that are biographies and narrative accounts.History Professor Walter Johnson said Faust’s book—which was published early last year—makes readers think about what the phrase ‘the war dead’ means in new ways.  “Its among the handful of books I think everyone should read about the Civil War,” Johnson said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.Johnson had nothing but praise for the book, and said he thinks it is very deserving of the award.“I can think of only two other [books]—out of thousands—which compare,” Johnson said.With this award, Faust will receive $50,000, an engraved medal, and the title ‘American Historian Laureate.’ President Faust will receive the award at a ceremony April 3.This is the fourth year that the Society, New York City’s oldest museum and research library, has given out the award.The selection process begins with a jury of five people reading all the entries and deciding on finalists. From these finalists the jurors settle on one winner.

Pi Day will pass by this Saturday, March 14, without the traditional festivities organized by the Mathematics Department, leaving at least one young math aficionado disappointed.Eight-year-old Ian Reid found out about the annual challenge to memorize the digits of pi last year. By New Year’s Day, he could recite 100 digits. “I haven’t even told him yet,” said Jasper Reid, Ian’s father. “He’s going to be disappointed.”In the past, celebrations of the irrational number have included pie-eating and pi-counting contests. Last year, a Boston College senior won the contest by rattling off 3,141 figures of pi.This year’s celebrations were put on hold because organizers would not be available. Math professor Noam D. Elkies, who has been one of the main organizers of the event, will not be in Cambridge this weekend and said that he was not able to find someone to take his place. Former Math Preceptor Bret J. Benesh had also been active in preparing the event, but he left Harvard last year. “So we finally decided to just forgo the pi partying this time around and try again next year,” Elkies wrote in an e-mail from a conference in Florida.  Despite the lack of festivities, the Math Department honored the day at its weekly forum held at Mather dining hall on Tuesday. Guest speaker Luke Anderson, a financial analyst for Harvard and the founder of TeachPi.org, discussed the historical fascination and what he called “modern pi fixation.” Anderson also made sure to perform his pi rap based on Eminem’s “Lose Yourself,” according to Juliana Belding, who organized Tuesday’s Math Table.Francois W. Greer ’11, who came in third place at last year’s pi-reciting contest, said he had not realized that the celebrations would be missing. He said that even if the festivities were taking place this year, he probably would not participate as he no longer recalls all 228 figures he recited last year.“It was pretty crazy,” he said of watching James Nile-Joyal reach 3,141 digits.Some of the 30 or 40 people who were in attendance began leaving long before he finished, according to Greer. This weekend some will still be celebrating pi day. A group on Craigslist.com explained their plan: “To celebrate Pi Day (3.14), we’ll gather at exactly 1:59pm in Boston Common to smash pies ever so gently in one another’s face.”—Staff writer Noah S.

Michael W. Shannon, the first African-American professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, whose work on environmental health and modern dance delighted colleagues and audiences alike, died Tuesday.Shannon was returning from vacation when he collapsed for unknown reasons, according to the Boston Globe. He was 55.The former head of emergency medicine at Harvard-affiliate Children’s Hospital was a leading authority on pediatric toxicology, said Gary R. Fleisher, chair of the Boston hospital’s department of medicine.“He was extremely reliable—you could depend on him for anything,” said Fleisher, who was Shannon’s close friend and colleague. “He always did more than his share of what needed to be done.”Shannon was returning from Argentina, where he spent his vacation taking tango lessons with his wife and friends. Fleisher recalled Shannon’s passion for dance—which, along with his pursuit of medicine, would come to define his life.“At our annual holiday parties, all the women would want to dance with Michael,” Fleisher said. “It was part of who he was.”Shannon first began dancing during his undergraduate years at Washington University in St. Louis, before heading to medical school at Duke. The newly minted doctor then came to Children’s in 1983 to complete his training as a resident and fellow—and had not left since.The pediatrician’s research on substance abuse and environmental health brought him to Washington, D.C., where he testified before the Food and Drug Administration on the unproven value of cold medicines for children.In 2003, Shannon was named director of the hospital’s newly established Center for Biopreparedness, which is charged with delivering antidotes to children in case of biochemical terrorism.Shannon’s interest in children’s health carried through to his life outside the hospital, leading him to form a youth group at his church to address teen issues such as sex, drugs, and alcohol.“His quiet, gentlemanly ways will be greatly missed,” Children’s Chief Executive James Mandell wrote in a message to staff Tuesday afternoon.Shannon is survived by his wife, Elaine, and two children, Evan and Lila—bothundergraduates at Stanford University.—Staff writer Noah S.

Freshman proctors may see cuts in their meal plans next year, according to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67. He said both cuts in the 15-meal per week allotment for proctors and a total abolishment of the proctor guest meal plan are on the table.“The proctors work hard and this is an important part of their compensation,” he said. “We want their presence in the dining hall.”While proctors emphasized the importance of interacting with students—especially in Annenberg—they also said they understand the necessity of possible cuts.“I think the meal plan is a significant source of cost to the FDO...if you look at things being cut around the university it’s not surprising,” said Aaron D. Chadbourne ’06, a freshman proctor. “As much as I respect HUDS, the food is not the reason I wanted to be a proctor.”While the 15-meal per week plan for freshman proctors might make up a significant percentage of the FDO’s budget, the 10-meal per semester guest meal allotment is probably not a big percentage of the budget said Ethan L. Gray ’05, a proctor in Canaday. He said that cuts to the guest meal plan would not be a big loss to proctors.So far this year the FDO has received 120 freshman proctor applications, up 30 from last year. Proctor applications were due in January but the FDO will continue to see applications come in this spring, possibly due to the allure of free housing in a down economy. “I think the economy doesn’t hurt people’s interest but the word on street is that [being a proctor] is rewarding work and people have a chance to make a difference,” Dingman said. Dingman said that the FDO has been working to cut programs and costs that will not directly affect students. The FDO has already cut 5 percent of its costs this year, reducing the number publications it prints and sending out letters to parents online rather than by mail. To meet the College’s mandatory 15 percent cut on all office budgets, the FDO also plans to make cuts to internal office staff appreciation programs, equipment upgrades, published materials, and travel and professional development programs. The office is also looking at cutting part-time staffing, overtime pay, and summer interns.—Staff writer Jillian K. Kushner can be reached at kushner@fas.harvard.edu

A newly formed committee of Harvard students is seeking to increase diversity at the Institute of Politics by inviting a more diverse slate of speakers and fellows and encouraging greater minority participation in IOP programs.The four-mounth-old IOP Diversity Council—created to advise the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee and the broader IOP community—aims to increase “diversity of opinions as well as racial, economic, gender and international diversity,” according to founder Honor S. W. McGee ’10.Each Council member works with a distinct IOP program, such as the IOP forum or IOP TV, to publicize events, offer advice on appealing to a more diverse audience, and encourage racial groups to actively engage with the IOP. Council members have also begun compiling suggested names for the IOP fellows program in the fall and plan to submit a suggested list for consideration to Program Manager Eric R. Andersen in April. “Having more diverse forum speakers and fellows is definitely a part of this,” said Student Advisory Committee President Mary K. Cox ’10, who works closely with members of the Council. “In the long term, what we really want is to have the general body of the active participants of the IOP to be more diverse.” Representatives on the Council include Timothy D. Turner ’09, president of the Black Students Association, as well as the political action chairs from the Chinese Students Association, the Black Pre-Law Association, and the South Asian Men’s Collective, according to Cox, who said around a dozen students regularly attend the meetings held once every two weeks.Cox said the IOP has engaged in diversity initiatives before, but that McGee’s plan represents a distinct approach. “Honor gets the IOP and she gets the racial and cultural groups around campus,” Cox said. “She knows how to bring them together.”McGee participated in the IOP’s Women’s Initiative in Leadership program last fall, while also serving as political action chair for the Association of Black Harvard Women. She said the experience prompted her to think about ways in which the IOP might work to increase participation from groups on campus.“I’m black, Jewish, and female, so any kind of diversity is something that I appreciate,” McGee said.She said she approached IOP Director and former Nashville Mayor Bill Purcell late last fall with the idea for a council, and he responded enthusiastically.“As Mayor, I always said that the government should look and feel like the place in which it operates,” Purcell said. “I brought that feeling with me here.”McGee said she hopes to expand the Council’s representation to include ethnic, political, and LGBT groups in the next few months. She also said she hopes to institutionalize the role of campus organization in the Council by automatically adding their political advocacy chairs to the group.—Staff writer Evan T. R.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Professor of Biological Oceanography James J. McCarthy heard about President Barack Obama’s reforms promoting scientific integrity in government earlier this week, he said he wasn’t shocked.“Nobody was surprised he did this,” said McCarthy, who was one of the original signers of a document in 2004 that accused former President George W. Bush of “misrepresenting and suppressing” science for political reasons. “Mr. Obama has surrounded himself with the very best scientific talent any president has had,” he said. “As advisers or heads of agencies, no president has drawn such talent into his apparatus.”McCarthy was not alone in his acclaim for Obama’s Monday announcement, which consisted of an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. It also included a memorandum that authorized John P. Holdren, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in Washington and a Harvard professor of environmental policy, to issue recommendations on ensuring scientific integrity in governance. Several Harvard professors praised Obama for reopening funding and creating the framework for reforming the role of science in public policy.Manfred Baetscher, director of the Genome Modification Facility at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, uses mice as a way to test methods of applying stem cell research. He called Obama’s announcement “a decision that’s been long overdue.” Baetscher also said that with the ban lifted, stem cell research will be more cost-efficient. According to Baetscher, researchers under the ban could not use equipment purchased with federal funds on human stem cells, meaning that oftentimes, research facilities had equipment reserved for humans and other equipment dedicated to animals.As for climate change, Brian F. Farrell, professor of meteorology, cautioned against expecting immediate action in public policy, noting that even science doesn’t have all of the answers on the issue.“I think first what you have to do is carefully assess the situation, that is, the most likely outcomes,” Farrell said. “You have to do the science correctly. I think one of the problems right now is that science can’t really answer the question of what will be the effect.”But Farrell was not cautious in condemning the Bush administration for its relationship with science, saying that “the previous administration just ignored or put off science” because of an agenda that was economically and morally motivated.The Clinton administration did very little with regard to science as well, said James G. Anderson, professor of atmospheric chemistry, arguing that the Clinton administration, while more open to science philosophically, in practice did not develop the infrastructure needed for energy and climate change research.Obama, Anderson believes, will be different because, in part, his rhetoric shows a more thorough understanding of science.“He described the problem without uttering the words ‘global warming,’” said Anderson. “For anyone studying this problem, it’s known that using the words ‘global warming’ is an inaccurate way of describing what’s happening in the climate.”“2009 is a year we will all remember,” Anderson said in praise of Obama’s memorandum. “It’s a turning point in confronting the issue of energy and the climate structure related to energy.”

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Already hauling in a VOID turkey on the first three days?  Impressive.  But don't give yourself a pat on the back.  Remember, there's no agency in this: you do not find the VOID, the VOID finds you.
Got slapped around by a midterm today?  Got another tomorrow?  Eh, its no big deal...think about how many of these things you get the wondrous opportunity to partake in.  At least you're not one of those poor thesis writers heading down to the wire--they kind of only get one shot at this and time's kind of running out.  FlyBy has faith in you '09ers, though, you'll come through in the clutch.
But we know what's really getting to you tonight.  Poor Tripp =(.  To cheer you up, a couple humorous selections that'll make you laugh, or ponder how utterly random this all is: old people, being old (via 2arrs2ells), and an old-school FlyBy favorite, featuring Ahhhnold.
Need a little inspiration?  FlyBy, having had a respectable childhood, had but one thought when that Ratatat announcement was made.  Yes. POKEMON.

John Edwards is Not in Exile, and is Still Talking About Poverty (Brown)
We didn't think John Edwards was still in the spotlight--but yesterday he spoke to a crowded lecture hall of Brown students, calling them to view global poverty not as an economic problem, but "a moral issue."  While we at Flyby would like to endorse the alleviation of world poverty, his choice to lecture on morality is slightly ironic. (Yes we are going to make the obligatory John Edwards joke: it was a late night for FlyBy so if you have a problem with that you can step off...or comment below.)  In any case, leaving one's cancer-stricken wife for a fling is morally questionable--and FlyBy's not sure morality even comes into play when that fling is a crazy New Age believer.  Perhaps because Edwards enjoys it when ladies stroke his ego.
In the meantime, Edwards may become a cosmopolitan human rights activist.  He told the Brown Daily Herald in an interview that he has already been to Haiti:
We'll be watching your search for redemption suspiciously, Jedwards.  But hope is not lost yet.
More, including a gunman and a special guest appearance by Chuck Norris, after the jump.
Administration Slow To Inform Students of Armed Gunman (Princeton)
Apparently it took 80 minutes for Princeton's administration to send out campus-wide alerts that there was a gunman on campus.  Although nothing actually happened, it did send the insular little Jersey town into a panic.  The incident raises the question of whether Harvard's text message system will actually work in the event of an emergency, but hell, FlyBy likes Drew Faust's odds against a gunman any day.  She'll be serving up a real nasty Republic of Suffering for you, wretched gun-bearer.  Just try it.
Boys Should Not Be Disappointed by Selection of Princeton Girls, Since They Themselves are Disappointing (Princeton)
An irritated sophomore girl writes an op-ed about how she is tired of hearing Princeton boys disparage the appearances of girls at Princeton, since looks are not everything--and they are being hypocritical.  If people must judge each other based on appearances, there should at least be gender equity:
Think about it, guys. And next time you’re tempted to bemoan the state of Ivy League ladies’ appearances, take a good hard look not only in the mirror, but at the stereotypes involved.
Granted, the "Prince" is slowly getting better.  Now they just need to take that bold final move and decide whether to employ a real Sexpert, or continue to leave the awkward task to Princeton's UHS officials.
RANDOM ASIDE: One Endowment that Will Never Shrink (The University of Chuck Norris)
If Texas secedes from the Union, Chuck Norris has declared his interest in becoming Texas' first president.
Since he enjoys name recognition across the state, and his ranger spirit mirrors that of the Texas, the idea is probably not out of the question.  For that matter, he would probably also take over the University of Texas at Austin and name the university after himself.  But one things certain: this man won't need any stimulus for his endowment.  (Cue laugh track.)
University Actually Announces Staff Lay-offs (Yale)
First, Yale officials openly announced that they would be laying off up to 300 staffers; now, they are admitting more...the additional cuts coming at their School of Management.  At Harvard, on the other hand, staffers are faced with the specter of lay-offs--but administrators have coyly maintained that lay-offs are just one option on the table. Okay administration, thanks for the assurance.  With Harvard's endowment in worse shape than Yale's, we're not so sure.

Kirkland resident Abel Acuña '11 and Pforzheimer's Johnathan M. Brugal '10 may be stealing some of the limelight from Harvard Hooligans. The duo's first foray into YouTube notoriety consists of a single one-minute music video. In the film, called "Harvard Bros", the two traipse around some of Harvard's most austere icons, singing about genitalia.
"Harvard Bros" is evidently a Crimson-themed cover of a viral hit from self-described filmmaker/comedians The Lonely Island, "Bing Bong Brothers". How does the Harvard set stack up? Check out the video after the jump (WARNING: Explicit language!)

Acuña and Brugal are both board members of the recently-formed Harvardwood Undergraduate Student Organization. According to Acuña, the video is part of an attempt to fill an artistic niche on campus. "We decided that Harvard needed more of a video and film presence, and we decided to spearhead that ourselves," says Acuña. Brugal adds that the video is a spoof on "stereotypical 'Harvard bros' walking around campus".
Though the first installment of this collaboration is a cover, The two undergrads plan to post more original content under Acuña's YouTube account, SeniorSpring. "Keep on the lookout for more films," says Acuña.

Hey everyone, UHS is doing something helpful and kind of awesome! They’ve recently stepped up their smoking cessation programs with increased publicity, a dedicated counselor, and--best of all––free nicotine patches.
Back in our high school days, FlyBy remembers that the cool kids used to use nicotine patches and gum just for the slight buzz. It was a lot more discreet than smoking, but it might as well have been a tattoo that said "I think I'm a badass!"  Prediction: As people take advantage of free and easy access to nicotine, it won’t be long before “patches” supplant laundry room quarters as the currency of roommate transactions.
Of course this is great news for people who actually would like to quit smoking. If that’s you, you should probably head over to UHS to enroll sooner rather than later before all the junkies abuse the system. The Advocate has already signed up as an organization, so all members are automatically registered.
Free is definitely cheaper than cigarettes and whatever else you’re smoking, and this way avoids bad breath and smelly clothes. What could possibly go wrong here?
No, seriously guys.

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency for all the houses.  Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you'll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
Want to know if you should take that Gordon's  shot at Leverett House next Wednesday night?  We've got an asset by asset breakdown of the house after the jump.
Rooming: Sneaky good. You’re never going to get shafted in this house.  While FlyBy would strongly recommend Dewolfe for your first year, you definitely won’t end up thrown in some 4x4 cage with a floater (like we’ve seen in some houses).  And Senior housing leaves you with some fine options: take out an entire ‘U’ in one of the top floors of Leverett towers (best views on campus!), or take your traditional n+1’s in the upper floors of Old Lev.
Dining Hall: Abysmal. Leverett’s dining hall could have just been quietly mediocre, but they insisted on throwing up that mess of a painting that someone, at some point, thought was good “modern art.”  And have you seen the windows? Those are definitely jail cell bars on them. And while the food is quite good and the guys at the grill are speedy and friendly, don’t count on brain break—Lev Dhall is notorious for being flooded with hungry physics nerds at night.
 House List: Tranquil. Leverett’s house list is about as bland as they come.  Threads are almost exclusively event postings, and even when someone posts things worth commenting on, no one responds.  Trust FlyBy, though, this is a positive: no house list heroes that post their inane thoughts.  And thanks to Gmail, all you have to do is throw up that filter.  Set it, and forget it!
 House Masters: Endearing? Creepy? While the Georgis are very friendly with the natives, FlyBy’s parents were a little irked by their insistence on introducing themselves as "Chief" and "Coach."  Rumor has it that they really get loose at their weekly Sherry hour in the Senior Common Room.
House Culture: Tepid. As the largest house, and one that happens to be divided amongst four non-adjoining buildings (including Dewolfe), it's got to be tough to build a defining house culture.  Add to that the fact that many just don’t want to rep shirts that prominently feature these, and it certainly gets tougher.  The Stein clubs are, in a word, WEAK. And Lev really lacks those iconic rooms that drive a healthy party scene (those of you who are of party grant age, do you ever remember a Lev party really turning it out?).  FlyBy does happen to be the #1 fan of  LevSPN though.
The Rating: BBB.* Leverett House will never evoke the kinds of emotions that an Adams, a Mather, or the Quad (didn't say they had to be good emotions) does.  When you tell your friends you’re a “Rising Rabbit,” next Wednesday, their facial expression probably won’t budge one bit.  But you should really be quite pleased.  In fact, if you find out you’re in Lev,  breathe a long sigh of relief.  There's some really low quality real estate out there, even right next door.
*Ratings run as such: [AAA > AA > A > BBB > junk > subprime]
