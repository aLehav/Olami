After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ubiquitous. Pedagogical. Capricious. Quintessential.
It seems as if long, winding words follow us everywhere at Harvard, popping up in every interaction we have or overhear. They are snuck into conversation offhandedly, thrown in as evidence of intellectualism and success, as if they prove one’s worth. Yes, of course, that person must belong at Harvard — they know how to easily and tactfully use the word “embourgeoisement.”
There’s an image of a Harvard student as someone who’s been using words like “sesquipedalian” for years and for whom faltering in their speech is unheard of. They can give presentations with ease and always have an obscure word on hand to express a concept that certainly already has an easier term. “Smart” becomes “perspicacious,” “strange” becomes “selcouth,” and “bragging” becomes “gasconading.”
A large portion of our existence on this campus feels like a race where sounding smart is enough to get you to the finish line.
But we come from different backgrounds, diverse enough to make any standard of ‘smart speech’ wholly unfair. I first encountered the word “pedagogical” two months ago at a Crimson Editorial meeting where it was thrown around rapidly. I then spent two minutes Googling it, and was thoroughly disappointed when I realized it just meant “relating to teaching.”
Not all of us grew up in heavily academic environments, where learning to accommodate this kind of speech came about as naturally as learning to walk. I can’t speak to the experience of having an accent or learning second, third, and fourth languages; I haven’t experienced those unfair struggles that may arise in our predominantly English-speaking university. But still, I know the fear of not sounding ‘smart enough’ all too well.
I find the battles of word choice that I often observe in academic settings startling, aware that my main focus when speaking, as someone with a speech impediment, is to get the words out at all. Sentences become inflated with fancy words for academic validation and approval, their meaning unchanging but their understandability decreasing.
I worry that my inability to compete in these fast-paced, complicated word exchanges will result in a label of incompetency, regardless of how accomplished I am. It is impossible for me to accept the fact that my and others’ disfluent speech has and can harm perceptions of our intelligence.
In environments like ours, people worry intensely over presentations they have to give, citing the possibility of stuttering as their worst fear. If they do end up faltering, they sit down nervously, begging others to tell them that it wasn’t noticeable. (It almost never is.) We focus too much on how we speak, and too little on the actual content of what we are saying and sharing with others.
Because what good is intellectual thought if it cannot be understood by your audience? What good is debate if the primary thought on your opponent’s mind is not the topic itself, but how to sound smarter than you? Our commitment to critical thinking seems to decrease the more we realize that we can get our validation from simply sounding like we understand. What wrongs could come from using simpler words, besides missing the chance to momentarily inflate one’s ego?
I’m not advocating for the eradication of all big words; I understand that their use in professional fields is inevitable and valuable at times. Public speaking skills are often very important, and people will always see value in the ability to eloquently explain confusing topics in ways that are complex yet necessary to their field.
What I am saying, instead, is that how we speak says little about our intellect and much more about our past and identity.
If we want to truly commit to making ourselves and this institution more inclusive, the expectation that we use fancy words must go. Sharing ideas should not scare people into silence as they worry over whether how they sound will meet our arbitrary standards of worthiness.
These standards are hard to escape, though, even for people who realize they exist. I apologize for any excessively big words I’ve used in this piece — seldom can I elude the ceaseless desire to be perceived as intellectually competent.
In better words, I too sometimes want to ‘sound smart,’ and being on this campus isn’t making my situation any better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In last Thursday’s edition of the Financial Times, I came across an intriguing Letter to the Editor.
Penned by a Mr. Stephen Overell in support of an earlier FT op-ed arguing that President Joe Biden’s self-embraced Irish identity should be treated with more seriousness than scorn, the letter notes with all due epistolary tact that, regardless of how Americans and Europeans might differ in how legitimate they perceive claiming affinity with an ethnic group as a member of the diaspora to be, what matters in the end is that Biden sees being Irish as a material, intrinsic part of who he is. Biden’s Irishness is then “real because it has real effects.”
It goes without saying that questions of identity have become a bitter contemporary nexus of social and political contention. Here in the United States, diametrically opposed beliefs about the formal status of different gender identities have met each other in battle in courtrooms and locker rooms, in legislative chambers and Twitter forums. Meanwhile, it has almost become routine to read about the latest police brutality-motivated protest, each one driving even deeper the fault lines of racial identity that have tragically long criss-crossed our nation.
The global situation is no better. As political science professor Barbara Walter argued last year in The New Republic, the 21st century has been defined by wars that are internal in nature, civil conflicts sparked by tensions derived from latent differences in ethnicity, religion, or other aspects of personal or group identity.
Perhaps it is time then to take a page out of whatever book Overell is reading and recognize that differences in how someone else views the nature or fluidity of a particular identity, though potentially unfamiliar to you, are nevertheless authentic and do not represent a license for mockery, derision, or mischaracterization. For as long as we have flourished as social animals, human identity — whether ethnic, religious, personal, or of any other variety — has always been more than a static sum of affinities and perceptions.
In my first column, I touched on the Harvard Art Museums’ collection of classical coinage, which includes an impressive abundance of currency minted by Cleopatra VII, the Ptolemaic Egyptian queen of literary and pop culture fame. A fractious debate has lately raged over the ruler’s ethnic and racial identity, one that, as Armani Syed recently discussed in Time Magazine, is ultimately reductive of the queen’s material accomplishments and futile attempts to preserve her waning domain from Roman domination.
Or consider an absurdly comical media story of late: a Florida principal forced to resign due to parental complaints about a lesson that incorporated Michaelangelo’s revered statue of David in the nude. Confronted with Renaissance notions about individual beauty and identity that evidently differed too far from their own, the reaction of far too many parents was one of revulsion and rejection. For readers who believe themselves to be a bit more tolerant, the third floor of the Art Museums is replete with sculptures and depictions extolling the ever-changing perceptions of beauty and physique that human societies have possessed over time.
To once again paraphrase Overell, viewing other individual or cultural identities purely through the lens of one’s own is a recipe for epistemic disaster. And to once more draw from the current neuroscience literature, there exists no intrinsic factor that makes the reality that one personally experiences different from those of others, for all human perceptions are inherently limited in a neurobiological sense in their ability to reflect and resolve objective ground truths. To discount the validity of another’s identity as anything less than fully “real” or legitimate from their perspective is to, quite literally, discount their fundamental humanity.
Over the past several weeks, I have attempted to regularly reflect on how our collective cultural heritage can provide incredibly useful insight about current affairs and, more generally, the human condition. As a formal student of the natural sciences rather than the fine arts or history, I claim no special ability to observe the interdisciplinary connections that I have put forward in this column. Nevertheless, at a time of tremendous uncertainty about what lies in our collective future, I have found it particularly illuminating, even reassuring, to muse just a bit “artifactually,” and I hope that now, you do too.

South Korean President Yoon Talks Nuclear Threats From North Korea at Harvard IOP Forum
Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay named Katherine O’Dair, who currently serves as University Marshal, to be her chief of staff Tuesday afternoon — the first addition to Gay’s presidential team as she prepares to move into Massachusetts Hall later this summer.
The appointment marks O’Dair’s second new position in Harvard administration in less than one year. O’Dair was named University Marshal in August, a role she will retain while serving as Gay’s chief of staff.
The announcement suggests Gay will make further appointments to her presidential administration in the coming weeks before she assumes the presidency on July 1.
Gay said in a press release that O’Dair will serve as “a key partner and adviser in advancing the president’s strategic priorities and a primary liaison to leaders across the institution.”
Prior to her appointment as University Marshal, O’Dair served as Dean of Students since her arrival at Harvard in 2016. She previously worked as a higher education administrator at Boston College and MIT.
O’Dair is currently overseeing the planning of Gay’s presidential inauguration in her role as University Marshal. Gay is set to be sworn in as the 30th University president on Sept. 29.
As chief of staff, O’Dair will supervise administrative operations of the Office of the President and oversee Gay’s presidential agenda. The role will also likely require O’Dair to frequently accompany Gay when she travels on University business.
Gay praised O’Dair for her “deep compassion, thoughtful intensity, and inclusive leadership.”
“Katie’s track record of successful leadership in complex environments, and the respect that she has earned from colleagues across Harvard’s schools, make her an ideal partner,” she said in a Tuesday press release.
“Her broad portfolio will strengthen connections within Harvard and with the larger community beyond Harvard, in keeping with my commitment to ensuring that Harvard, in its values and structures, is engaged in the world,” Gay added.
O’Dair said in the release that it was a “privilege to join President-elect Gay’s team and I am inspired to support her vision for a Harvard that is deeply connected to the world.”
“I am deeply grateful to President-elect Gay for the opportunity to bring my experience to this new and exciting role, and look forward to working with the talented team in the president’s office to support her leadership at this exceptional institution,” she said.

Harvard University Police Advisory Board Appoints Undergrad Rep After Yearlong Vacancy
The Cambridge City Council discussed the fiscal year 2024 budget and a policy order requesting a zoning petition at a meeting Monday.
City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 presented a proposal for capital and operating budgets for fiscal year 2024 to the council. According to Cambridge’s website, the projected budget adoption date is June 5.
The year’s operating budget increased by $80 million, or 10 percent greater than the fiscal year 2023 figure, bringing the overall budget to approximately $882 million. The capital budget, deployed to support city infrastructure and other projects, is approximately $185 million.
A portion of the budget increase is due to an accounting change, as $23 million allocated to the affordable housing trust funding was shifted from the capital budget to the operating budget, which did not increase expenditures.
Huang said the city’s budget priorities include “affordable housing and homelessness, early childhood, sustainability, vision-zero traffic safety, and anti-racism equity and inclusion.”
These five areas will be covered by the total consolidated spending of $279 million for FY24, marking an increase from $220 million in FY23. The increase is due to greater allocations for infrastructure projects and greater resourcing for key initiatives related to homelessness, climate, and universal pre-K.
The city will hold three public hearings on the proposed budget in May, including meetings involving the City Council Finance Committee and the School Department.
During the meeting, councilors also discussed a policy order which calls on Huang to direct Cambridge’s Community Development Department to draft a zoning petition that will be submitted to the City Council for consideration.
According to the order, the petition should be based upon proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay, which was passed in 2020 and aims to support the construction of new affordable apartment buildings.
“Our goal is to allow affordable housing to be easier and also to make the Affordable Housing Overlay strong such that we don’t have to revisit it,” said Councilor Burhan Azeem, one of the co-sponsors of the policy order.
But Councilor Paul F. Toner said the policy order requires “further conversation.”
“I feel the urgency for affordable housing, but I also feel the urgency that we get this right and try to build as much consensus as possible,” he said.
Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 exercised her charter right, a councilor’s option to postpone the discussion of an order to a later time, delaying the vote to the next regular city council meeting, which is scheduled for May 8.

Cambridge Announces Launch of Direct Payment Program for Eligible Low-Income Families

Cambridge City Manager Unveils $882 Million Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Proposal
The City of Cambridge announced the launch of “Rise Up Cambridge,” a direct cash program to combat family poverty and income inequality, at a news conference Tuesday.
Rise Up Cambridge is a $22 million assistance program that uses funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act to provide direct cash assistance to eligible families that apply. Under the program, households earning at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level and with children who are aged 21 or under receive $500 per month for 18 months.
“Families living in poverty simply do not have enough money to achieve stability because the economic growth that we’ve seen in Cambridge has not benefited everyone,” Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said during the conference.
In 2021, the city launched Cambridge Recurring Income for Success and Empowerment — often referred to as RISE — to assist low-income, single-caretaker families severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. RISE, which acted as a pilot for Rise Up Cambridge, was a guaranteed-income initiative that offered $500 payments for 18 months to more than 100 eligible households chosen by lottery.
Rise Up Cambridge will begin accepting applications on June 1, and initial payments will roll out beginning June 30.
“This is what government should be doing,” Siddiqui said.
Rise Up Cambridge is jointly run by the Office of the Mayor, the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, and the Cambridge Community Foundation.
“It’s saying to our Cambridge residents that we see you, we trust you to use this money how you want to use this money to help your family,” Siddiqui said in an interview following the conference.
The goal of the program is to provide families with children with direct cash assistance, empowering residents to determine how to best meet their financial needs and addressing economic disparities and racial inequities in Cambridge.
“There is a deep dignity in giving people the choice and power to decide what they need,” City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 said during the conference.
In an interview following the conference, Huang said Rise Up Cambridge is a step towards “recognizing that individuals, but especially families, really need the resources in this day to have opportunity for them to thrive.”
“So much of the services that we build in our city are making such a difference in people’s lives, but at the root of it is income,” he said. “I think cash assistance really recognizes that.”
U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), who also attended and spoke at the conference, described the launch of Rise Up Cambridge as “an extraordinary moment.”
Tina M. Alu, the executive director of the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, said during the conference that the CEOC — along with the Mayor’s Office and other nonprofit partners — will be conducting outreach for the program in seven different languages throughout the city.
“I’m always happy to live and work in Cambridge, but on days like this, I’m especially proud,” she said.

A utility box and its supporting equipment fell out of place at the Harvard Square T station Monday afternoon, hitting a woman standing at a nearby column and sending her to the hospital for evaluation.
The accident adds to a growing list of recent safety problems plaguing Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority stations and trains, including a near-miss in March, also at the Harvard Square station, when a ceiling panel fell and almost struck a rider.
In a tweet, the MBTA said the woman had been hit by a “supporting bracket” for the utility box as it dropped down the column next to where she had been standing.
MBTA spokesperson Lisa Battiston wrote in an emailed statement that “corrosion on the support straps” securing the box had caused the dislodgement. After visiting the site yesterday, Phillip Eng — the new general manager of the MBTA — ordered inspections to determine if other stations have similar equipment and to assess their condition. Battiston said the inspections would be finished by the end of the day on Tuesday.
The boxes have not been in use since 2013, according to Battiston. A laboratory at MIT installed them as part of a pilot program in three Cambridge Red Line stations in 2011 to “evaluate the technology” meant to “house sensors capable of detecting and identifying biological agents,” Battiston wrote.
Sandro Enriquez, an MBTA attendant working at the time of the incident, said he offered to help the injured woman, who had already called 911.
“She was not in bad condition, she was a little scratched,” he said. “I’m glad that she was okay.”
Last summer, the Federal Transit Authority ordered the MBTA to take dramatic steps to improve rider safety and address poor working conditions. Since then, T riders have seen a rising number of slow zones, service cuts, and line disruptions.
Riders criticized what they saw as the MBTA’s lack of proper maintenance.
“They should have remodeled this a long time ago,” said Djenifer Nazaire, a Red Line rider who lives near Alewife.
Chris George, who regularly takes the Red Line from his home in Dorchester, said it was “about maintenance, keeping up with it.”
“I do ironwork and I see this all the time. You go to bridges and they’re rusted out, and they should’ve been maintained 15 years ago, and it’s just a matter of putting it off until someone gets hurt,” he said.
“That’s a prime example. It may have been passed by, never looked at,” he said, referring to the corroded equipment that fell.
Enriquez, the attendant, said that because of these safety incidents, the customer service aspect of his job was “mentally and emotionally sometime too much for me.”
“But I have to do my job. I just do my job,” he continued.
In response to criticisms, Eng wrote that “delivering safe, reliable, and appropriate service is paramount and the MBTA is fully committed to ensuring that we do just that,” calling the incident “a stark reminder of the challenge at hand” for the T.
“Our team took immediate action to inspect every station to ensure there were not additional risks to riders,” Eng wrote. “When I accepted this position, I fully understood the challenges and responsibility, but I remain confident that we will be successful. Ensuring safety is vital to restoring public confidence and trust.”
Red Line service will continue to face major disruptions concentrated in its southern branches over the next month. The T will divert riders to shuttle buses as it continues working on the tracks to eliminate some of the 97 speed restrictions across the Red Line. In March, the MBTA implemented additional restrictions after the Department of Public Utilities found the T had not been properly documenting track issues.
George, however, said he has not noticed any difference following the extensive track work thus far.
“I don’t know what they did, but it didn’t make it any faster,” he said.
Still, George said he remains positive, even though his commute from Dorchester to Harvard Square has now reached an hour and a half.
“Why get yourself mad over something you should have already expected?” he said. “I expect the train to be this slow. I accepted it in my heart.”

Cambridge City Manager Unveils $882 Million Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Proposal
Financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey E. Epstein met with Harvard professor Martin A. Nowak, linguist Noam Chomsky, and other unidentified academics in March 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.
The meeting took place at Nowak’s Harvard office at 1 Brattle Square, Chomsky confirmed Tuesday. Chomsky, currently a professor at the University of Arizona and an emeritus professor at MIT, was among several notable figures named by the Journal who were not previously known to have associated with Epstein. Chomsky served as a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University in the 1950s.
According to Epstein’s schedules, the Journal reported, Chomsky met with Epstein on several occasions during 2015 and 2016, including a meeting with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak.
Epstein’s deep ties to the University have previously been reported, including millions of dollars in donations, some of which funded Nowak’s work. The gift established Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. In 2006, after Epstein was charged with procuring a minor for prostitution in Florida, Harvard said it would not return the millionaire’s donations.
Chomsky and Nowak are just two members of a vast array of academics, politicians, and celebrities that Epstein has been linked to — a list that also includes Harvard professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz and former University president Lawrence H. Summers.
Epstein’s scheduled meetings detailed by the Journal all took place several years after his 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution in Florida, which resulted in him registering as a sex offender and serving more than one year in prison. The Journal could not verify whether all scheduled meetings actually occurred.
In response to an email from The Crimson inquiring about his association with Epstein, Chomsky confirmed that he and his wife “knew him and met with him a number of times.”
Chomsky wrote the March 2015 meeting took place at Nowak’s office in the 1 Brattle Square offices of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which was established in 2003 through a $6.5 million grant from Epstein. The office was subleased from the Harvard Kennedy School, which leased the space from a private owner.
“Like all of those in Cambridge who met and knew him, we knew that he had been convicted and served his time, which means that he re-enters society under prevailing norms — which, it is true, are rejected by the far right in the US and sometimes by unscrupulous employers,” Chomsky wrote. “I’ve had no pause about close friends who spent many years in prison, and were released. That's quite normal in free societies.”
During the meeting in Nowak’s office, Chomsky wrote, the group discussed neuroscience and computer science. Chomsky declined to provide names of other Harvard faculty in attendance, adding that “it would be improper to subject others to slanderous attacks.”
“I’ve often attended meetings and had close interactions with colleagues and friends on Harvard and MIT campuses, often in labs and other facilities built with donations from some of the worst criminals of the modern world,” Chomsky wrote. “People whose crimes are well known, and who are, furthermore, honored by naming the buildings in their honor and lavishly praised in other ways. That’s far more serious than accepting donations, obviously — and these are huge donations.”
Asked if he regretted his association with Epstein, Chomsky wrote, “I’ve met [all] sorts of people, including major war criminals. I don’t regret having met any of them.”
Epstein was arrested again in 2019 by federal prosecutors, who alleged he sexually trafficked scores of underage girls at properties in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. Epstein died in jail awaiting trial, in what a medical examiner ruled was a suicide.
Following Epstein’s arrest and death, the University launched an investigation into his relationship with Harvard, culminating in a 27-page report released in May 2020.
According to the report, Epstein — whose fortune of more than half a billion dollars has no clear origin — donated more than $9 million to Harvard between 1998 and 2007, more than $700,000 of which was given after his 2006 arrest on federal charges of procuring minors for prostitution. The report noted that the University did not accept gifts following Epstein’s 2008 conviction.
The 2006 charges were later dropped in a controversial non-prosecution agreement negotiated in part by Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor who represented Epstein at the time. Around this time, in 2007, Epstein’s attorneys — including Dershowitz — wrote a letter to federal prosecutors arguing that Epstein had not technically violated a law against soliciting sex from minors over the internet, citing textual analysis provided by Harvard Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker.
Both Pinker and Dershowitz have said publicly they regret their association with Epstein.
Epstein’s closest contact at Harvard — and the largest beneficiary of his financial support — was Nowak, a professor of Mathematics and Biology, according to the report.
Epstein donated $6.5 million in 2003 to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, directed by Nowak. According to the report, the program granted Epstein unfettered access to its facility at 1 Brattle Square and maintained a private office for him — later found in 2021 to be in violation of University policies around campus access.
The report found that Epstein visited the program’s office on more than 40 occasions between 2010 and 2018, even after he had registered as a sex offender in New York and Florida.
“Epstein typically used the visits to meet with professors from Harvard and other institutions to hear about their work,” the report said. “He generally gave Professor Nowak the names of the academics he wished to meet, and either he or Professor Nowak invited them to meet with Epstein at PED’s offices.”
In 2003, The Crimson reported that Epstein maintained close friendships with Summers, then University president, as well as former FAS Dean Henry Rosovsky. When asked about the meetings at the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics in 2018, Rosovsky told The Crimson in 2018 that he “attended a couple of sessions and lost interest.” Summers’ assistant declined to comment for the 2018 article.
Harvard’s report did not discuss Summers’ or Rosovsky’s ties to Epstein.
Following the report’s release, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay placed Nowak on paid leave. A year later, in March 2021, she announced that Nowak had violated multiple Harvard policies and barred him from receiving grants or taking on advisees for two years, in addition to shuttering the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.
In the March 2021 announcement, Gay wrote she would decide whether to restore Nowak’s privileges after two years. Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on Nowak’s current status or whether Gay had made a decision on restoring his privileges.
Nowak did not respond to a request for comment for this article. He has said previously that he regretted fostering a relationship between Epstein and Harvard.
The report does not identify which Harvard faculty Epstein met with at the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics office, describing them only as “leading scholars from Harvard and elsewhere in science and math and, occasionally, individuals involved in public life.”
“Epstein was routinely accompanied on these visits by young women, described as being in their 20s, who acted as his assistants,” the report added.
The report says Epstein was the “driving force behind these meetings,” setting the dates and the guest list, and occasionally inviting political figures. The report also notes “a number” of faculty visited Epstein at his properties in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico, and his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands — referred to by locals as “pedophile island,” per the Los Angeles Times.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment, referring The Crimson to the 2020 report.
Epstein also financially supported the research of Harvard Medical School professor George M. Church and Psychology professor Stephen M. Kosslyn, who in 2005 recommended Epstein for a visiting fellowship he was “unqualified to pursue,” the report said.
On Kosslyn’s recommendation, Epstein was named a visiting fellow from 2005 until his 2006 arrest, but “did little to pursue his proposed course of study,” the report said.
The report found that then-University President Drew G. Faust and then-dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith independently decided — around 2008 and in 2013, respectively — that Harvard would not accept further gifts from Epstein, and he did not donate to the school after 2007.

As the curtains close on the spring semester of my first year, I cannot help but walk down memory lane. From sticky note messages on windows to laundry room fires, there were many beautiful occurrences that have forever imprinted themselves in my mind. The most memorable of them all, however, is Annenberg Hall itself. As both a love letter and expose, let’s review the top Berg happenings of the year:
Faculty Dinners
Welcome to WatchMojo. Today, we’re counting down the top 10 betrayals of all time. Up first: Faculty Dinners. This was when we realized what HUDS was truly capable of. Ice sculptures? Edible food? A CREPE STATION? Where was all this normally???
Yet again, Berg showed us that it CAN pull out all the stops for the people who actually matter. Forget the freshmen and their happiness, how can we impress their professors? Alas, I was happily devouring creme brulee one evening, and swallowing chewy roast beef the next.
Brain breaks
No jokes here, brain break is just SO cute. All the sleep-deprived freshmen gather together to laugh, sing, and eat cinnamon toasters (God forbid they buy on-brand cereal with their ever-growing endowment). Rushing from Cabot to break through those doors before 11 p.m. was arguably more of a thrill than jumping fences at river run. Despite the limited options, brain break was integral to the freshman experience. This was the prime time to awkwardly run into people you swore to get a meal with. This was the place to gather Ec 10 pset answers. This was the place where you met all your best friends. So, cherish the last time you call bowls of goldfish a meal or admire Berg’s (finished?) ceiling. Nothing will ever be quite as wholesome and pure as Annenberg brain breaks.

If you were daring enough to stand in that obscenely long line or contaminate your hands with that sticky scooper, you were able to enjoy Berg’s prized Sunday sundaes. Despite the perfectly warm caramel sauce and immaculate range of toppings, this tradition still has its caveats. Did the annoying kid from section take the last of the M&Ms? Yes. Did they run out of ice cream before I even got a second scoop? Yes. Did I find that murky water that’s “supposed to clean the scooper” relatively suspicious? Again, yes. I don’t care though, my eternal love for Sunday sundaes survives these minor setbacks.
The HUDS revamp 
This was a thing… until it wasn’t. Before the revamp, HUDS would slap soy sauce on everything and call it Korean. Now, they have a slightly less offensive approach to Asian food — they add sesame seeds! Jokes aside, I was greatly appreciative of this development. I found myself ENJOYING the dining hall food??? I truly did not know that could ever be a possibility. Yes, the hype has died down and so has the quality. However, the effort is what counts and I am forever appreciative.
Berg <3,
Despite your red-hued chicken and watered down coffee, you have both nourished and sustained me this past year. Not only have you introduced me to some of the most extraordinary people, you have taught me invaluable lessons. You taught me that not even the best school in the world could beat my mom’s cooking. You taught me that I could survive for weeks on french fries and chocolate milk. Most importantly, you taught me that all good things have to come to an end. I will love and miss you endlessly!

The art installation “Allumination” is the rejuvenation of a formerly abandoned building with paint and recycled materials.

Within a fenced-off yard on Western Ave is the public work of art titled “Face of Allston.” The mural was completed in 2017 and was painted by contemporary artist and Allston resident Pete Cosmos and aims to represent Allston’s population, history, and cliches.
An ode to Allston, Sam Fish’s “Allston Rock City” is one of three garage murals in Zone 3’s Walls on Western mural series. It was completed in 2019 and celebrates the creativity of the neighborhood.

Painted on the front exterior of 267 Western Ave is the mural “Saya Patri,” which translates from Nepali to “One With a Hundred Petals,” installed in 2018 by IMAGINE. IMAGINE is a pseudonym for Boston-based artist Sneha Shrestha who incorporates aspects of her Hindu-Buddhist Nepali upbringing into her work. Plastered on the windows of the building are posters advertising Zone 3’s upcoming community events.
Sculpted in 1967 by Donald Harcourt De Lue, “Quest Eternal” was inspired by a previous Italian sculpture of the same name. The sculpture was originally installed by the Prudential Tower in Boston, but was relocated to Allston in 2019.
