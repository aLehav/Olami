The city of Miami is racist, sex-obsessed, and confused in Tom Wolfe’s new novel “Back to Blood.” Wolfe, author of many bestsellers including “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” and “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” is known for his daring narrative style. In “Back to Blood,” Wolfe tries to represent modern American life and the difficulty of maintaining distinct cultures in a rapidly homogenizing city. Through references to pop songs, iPhones, Spanish, and modern media, Wolfe tries to delve into contemporary Miami life. He ends up, however, betraying his age and separation from pop culture in awkward prose and word choices that are distracting from the central story.
Struggles of racism and individuality play out in Miami’s scorching hot scenery, shifting between boats, police headquarters, and psychiatric offices. The characters are as varied and diverse as the scenery, but after a few tangential stories, Wolfe focuses the novel on  Nestor Camacho, a Cuban-American police officer. Nestor starts the trajectory of the story when he follows orders to retrieve an illegal Cuban immigrant from the top of a ship’s mast. “How could you do that to a man of your own blood?” his father asks him angrily, forcing Nestor to think about his cultural identity as it conflicts with a high-demand job.
The conflict of a person’s blood and his desire to be American is, as Wolfe represents it, a generational war as much as it is an internal battle. Some parents in “Back to Blood” forbid their children to speak in their native languages for fear of discrimination, while others essentially disown their children when they become too American. Unfortunately for these compelling depictions, Wolfe spends only snatches of time with each character and instead devotes more of the ample page count to names of stores, sex terms, odd punctuation, and distracting capitalization. The distracting and awkward constructions weigh down the story. The time Wolfe devotes to the extra words takes away time he could be using to develop the characters more fully.
Presumably, Wolfe’s frequent use of brand-name words and electronic products are meant to tie the narration to a modern perspective, but those sentences come off sounding unnatural. Whereas today’s young generation is used to talking about texting, YouTube, and Facebook, Wolfe is clearly not. Few young people would refer to the “glass face of the iPhone” as Wolfe does, or “this YouTube introduction of Nestor Camacho to the world!” Wolfe is not used to the Spanish words that pepper the story either, and he often—perhaps offensively—mentions that his two Cuban characters, Nestor and Magdalena, do not have a grasp on the English language and culture. “She had no idea what an epigraph was,” Wolfe writes about Magdalena. “She had a vague notion of Anna Karenina…somebody in a book?”
“Back to Blood” is not a fluid read, because the perspective descends erratically into the minds of different characters. Wolfe chooses to mark each shift from third person omniscient to first person with six consecutive colons. These interruptions appear in the middle of a paragraph, such as “::::::I’m...pumped!::::::” interjected into the middle of a narration about Nestor. It becomes impossible to get to the bottom of the page without being distracted.
Adding to the confusion is the fact that the plot jumps physical locations as often as it shifts perspectives. From Cuban neighborhoods and Russian art galleries, to a newsroom populated with Ivy League-bred WASPs and a frightening island of elite nymphomaniacs, Miami appears to be a city in defiance of the melting pot metaphor so often applied to cities in America. At one point, Nestor and his journalist friend John Smith drive out of Miami. Smith is surprised by the geographical change: “We’ve just entered a strange land…called America!” he exclaims. “We’re not in Miami anymore. Can you feel it?”
In the short scene that follows, the removal from the heart of Miami is certainly felt by the readers as Wolfe’s lexical choices take the reader away from the noise of the city. Scenes inside strip clubs and on the streets of Miami are invaded by sound words and uncomfortable punctuation, but once the narration moves to locations farther away from Miami, the writing takes on a far more straightforward quality. Such scenes are a relief from the stress of reading Wolfe’s Miami prose. He keeps the readers alert with “THUMPS” and “SMACKS” and “uhhh uhhh uhhh” sound effects, but distracts from what would otherwise be an interesting account of assimilation and immigrant experience in a modern American city.
Wolfe is well known for depicting sounds in his novels, which creates an atmosphere for his characters that is unique. He is liberal with punctuation, longer words, and interruptions in the middle of prose, but in “Back to Blood,” his writing style does not add to the plot or the development of his characters. Wolfe’s transcriptions of thought processes and phonetic speech affectations may have positively enhanced his other novels, but something falls flat in his most recent one. The detached way he writes about modern technology, in combination with a finicky perspective that jumps from character to character, may leave the book’s readers feeling unfulfilled. If more of the novel had taken place outside of Miami, where Wolfe’s writing is often fluid and captivating, the essence of the story may have better emerged. Wolfe’s depiction of Miami’s unique resistance to the “melting pot” phenomenon is interesting, but unfortunately, it remains too hard to sift through everything on the periphery for that intent to make much of a difference by the end of the novel.

From the wanderings of Odysseus to Sal Paradise’s open road, the idea of a fixed home has always been an intriguing focus of literature. The stories in Emma Donoghue’s new collection “Astray” also traffic in concerns with flight and longing. Donoghue moves between centuries and continents, creating characters full of yearning for a metaphorical home while plagued by the remembrance of a home they had to abandon. “When you change countries, perhaps your old self stays fixed to your back, like a turtle’s shell,” she writes in “Onward,” a story from the collection’s opening section. “Astray” presents the idea of a former home that is as necessary to leave as it is impossible to forget.
This is Donoghue’s first work since the 2010 release of her acclaimed novel, “Room,” which describes a mother’s effort to create a new world for a son who knows nothing but the room where his mother has been contained for the past seven years. What made “Room” so piercing was its lack of geographical or chronological scope, but with “Astray,” Donoghue has opted to go the opposite route. Her stories span four centuries and two continents. She covers territory that varies from the newly established Plymouth colony to grim 19th century London and uses historical accounts as launching points for her stories. Despite the broadness of settings, all of the stories in “Astray” are united in their portrayal of émigrés in the midst of a process of relocation. Donoghue has divided the collection into three neat sections, aptly titled “Departures,” “In Transit,” and “Arrivals and Aftermaths,” in order to convey her characters’ physical and emotional progression from original home to eventual destination. It’s a shame that a good half of the collection, like Donoghue’s doomed characters, never makes it past the departure point, resulting in a book that ranges from riveting intrigue to disconnected shlock.
It is not surprising that “Departures” is the collection’s strongest section. Here Donoghue’s portrayals of yearning and despair take center stage; the urgency present throughout “Departures” makes engrossing accounts of seemingly banal subjects, such as 18th-century legal proceedings in “The Widow’s Cruse.” The most innovative “Departures” story is its opener, “Man and Boy.” The entire story is composed of a one-sided dialogue between a man and an elephant, none other than Jumbo of Barnum’s Circus fame. Jumbo was acquired by Barnum after a life spent in England with his keeper, Matthew Scott, the man in this section. Although the story’s concept risks ridiculousness, Donoghue fills her account of Jumbo’s forced deportation with moments of tender poignancy, making Scott and Jumbo’s parting as tragic as a separation between lovers. As Scott tells Jumbo, “But the thing is, lad, you’re going to have to go sooner or later. You know that, don’t you?” Here, the simplicity of Donoghue’s writing conveys the sadness of the soon-to-be separated friends without veering into melodrama, making even interspecies friendship seem plausible.
Donoghue handles emotion quite well in more serious settings, as seen in “The Hunt,” an account of rape and pillage during the Revolutionary War. She follows a 15-year old German mercenary, known as “Half Bosch” because of his small stature, who in winter 1776 is stationed in New Jersey and tasked with finding provisions and women for the camp. When Half Bosch happens upon a young girl, he helps her avoid the eyes of the lecherous troops and promises to lead her to safety. When the men tease the boy about his manhood, however, he feels that he has no choice but to deliver the girl into the camp and have his way with her. Donoghue skillfully portrays the conflict between innocence and duty with sparse sentences that illustrate the horrors of what the children are about to endure. “And for a moment, as they set off across the meadow hand in hand like children, he lets himself believe that they are running away. That he is man enough to be a deserter.... But all the while he knows how it’s going to be. He will lead her into the barracks that must be already filling up with other girls...whose eyes will tell this girl all she needs to know.”
At their best, Donoghue’s imaginings are entrancing in their simplicity, but it is when she strays outside these bounds of subtlety that the unevenness of the collection becomes apparent. “The Long Way Home,” an account of a man’s forced return at the hands of a gruff female bounty hunter, ends up being hokey with dialogue that could have been snatched from the nearest pulp fiction on hand.
“Mollie keeps her grin on. ‘Do I look scairt?’
‘Crazy as popcorn on a stove, that’s what you look.’
‘Don’t push me, Jensen. I’d rather deliver you in one piece.’”
It is frankly a bit embarrassing to find dialogue this cheesy in the same collection as “Man and Boy” or “The Hunt,” stories that subtly deal with themes like friendship and rape. There, she evokes her characters’ struggles with a “less is more” attitude, and her sparse writing often succeeds in inciting an emotional response. Stories with overblown conversations and period details like “The Long Way Home,” however, undermine the simple, direct writing that remains Donoghue’s greatest talent.
Perhaps Donoghue is best able to capture feelings of homesickness and regret because of her own experience as a two-time émigré. When she strays too far from home, however, her stories lose their effectiveness. It is here that she veers into stereotypical representations and fails to reach the heights of her talent. As evinced in “Room” and the better parts of “Astray,” Donoghue is at her best when she describes the act of escape. It is only when her characters reach their destination that her writing begins to unravel.

“All you need is love,” a certain well-known English band once sang. But love is not enough to hold together every story of British love. It forms the background behind John Toomey’s book “Huddleston Road,”  but here, Toomey haphazardly brings together a pair of young adults with no rhyme or reason. The underdeveloped main characters Vic and Lali seem like clichéd stand-in actors from typical dramas. Toomey attempts to portray a deep and flawed emotional connection between Vic and Lali, but mostly fails at establishing any sort of realism.
Vic is an Irish school teacher living in London when he falls for Lali, a mesmerizing coffee-shop owner. She is initially just a “graceful flicker” in his periphery, and her initial indifference to him only adds to her mystery. He soon realizes she is emotionally unstable, with moods that switch from gregarious to withdrawn, all with a mean undercurrent. For some reason, unexplained by Toomey, these mood swings are attractive and even love-inducing. The first half of the story follows the fledgling relationship in London, but the couple’s tale will probably fail to affect the reader emotionally. Toomey refrains from even giving the reader a physical description of either of the lovers. Lali is some sort of foreign beauty and Vic is freckled, but beyond these basic descriptions, Toomey fails to provide any sense of unique interest for the reader in his couple.
There is a constant sense of something missing while reading the novel. Toomey attempts to give the reader a sense of Lali’s background and personality by introducing her grandmother, who comes across as an amalgamation of Mrs. Potts from “Beauty and the Beast” and the Dowager Countess from “Downton Abbey.” Yet the flow of adjectives simply describes Lali’s negative attributes. The book also lacks an introspective analysis of Vic and his reason for staying with an unappreciative and cruel woman, besides her beauty.
Inexplicable love may work under the right circumstances, but the tactic as a literary trope falls flat here because its inexplicability is never addressed. One of Toomey’s few attempts to understand Vic’s psyche is hopelessly convoluted. “Having heard now, the history of her, and appreciating the scope and significance of her amorphous suffering,” he writes, “he found that it militated against his more extreme emotional reactions—frustration and contempt.” Toomey appears to have simply surveyed contemporary clichés and pulled out what was most trendy: an unattainable manic pixie dream girl.
The book has a constant feeling of missing its core. The foundations of their relationship are so shaky that by the time Lali and Vic buy a house and have a child, none of their story feels real. Thus when Vic begins questioning his commitment, the desired emotional response from a reader is absent. The resonance of emotional goodbyes falls flat, and it just becomes another piece of the puzzle that doesn’t quite fit.
The second half of the book, once Vic comes to the realization that “love wasn’t enough,” is much more realistic. Vic’s indiscretions with fellow teachers, his truly endearing love for his daughter, and his utter loneliness and confusion about his future are portrayed with refreshing introspection and gravity. His reflection on his relationship with Lali forms the majority of his thoughts. He realizes that “he never caught on, never learned to mistrust her good turns as much as her bad.”
In this latter narrative, Toomey sets a tone of self-aware irony. There are multiple instances where he appears to be poking fun at his writing and knowingly chiding his clichéd characters: “’She’s a myth…all girls like that are. Your desire for her is rooted in some unattainable fantasy.’” When Vic finds a poem in Lali’s things, he deems it “pedestrian in its wretchedness, completely predictable in its melancholy.” These descriptions could easily apply to the first half of the novel. This last section of the book, though at times tedious, is touching and almost makes up for the lackluster first part. Vic’s self-reflection is satisfyingly real and relatable. “It was often the most beautiful things that saddened her,” he recalls. “Whenever he thought of it, he couldn’t help but acknowledge that her fate had been coming from a long way out; an inner poison pollinated in her soul; flowering like her own lethal beauty.”
“Huddleston Road” is full of too many clichés and explores only the surface of its characters, but the end is touching regardless of Toomey’s portrayal of Vic and Lali. The love of their relationship comes across artfully, but the underlying motivations behind it are absent. Their story lacks a unique personal element. It is this element that separates a vapid screenplay from a profound narrative. Toomey’s patchwork attempt at portraying a modern couple is far too shallow; the novel is only partially redeemed by his surprisingly astute description, near the end of the novel, of life after love.

Let’s talk about Going For It. If you looked up the definition of that phrase in the dictionary, you’d see a picture of “Cloud Atlas,” the Wachowski siblings and Tom Tykwer adaptation of David Mitchell’s celebrated novel. Interweaving six disparate narrative arcs over the course of nearly three hours, it’s impossible to deny that “Cloud Atlas” just straight-up Goes For It. This, obviously, does not give the film’s substantial flaws a free pass, but holistically “Cloud Atlas” achieves striking novelty.
Here are some things that “Cloud Atlas” is about: a doctor sailing the Pacific in 1849, a composer and his amanuensis in 1936, a reporter investigating a nuclear plant in 1973 San Francisco, a book publisher trapped in a nursing home in 2012, a genetically-engineered clone who rebels against her creators in a 2144 version of Seoul dominated by consumerism, and a post-apocalyptic era in which a goat herder climbs a mountain. Simple, right? As the film cuts between all six storylines at a frenetic pace, it’s probably confusing but never boring, and above all, the shortest three-hour movie you’ll ever see.
Common threads run through each of the stories—grandiose themes about freedom and courage and identity. Sometimes, more concrete details carry over, like when, in 1973, Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) reads letters written by the composer portrayed in 1936, Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw). In one sequence, clips of a stowaway slave demonstrating his sailing prowess by climbing up the mast, are interspersed with those of a clone and her lover walking precariously across a tiny metal bridge to escape. Elsewhere, a train appears twice, running along the same stretch of track: once in 1936 and again in 2012. The themes are reflected and refracted across time and space, underscoring the film’s central topic of interconnectivity.
One of the showcased filmmaking techniques in “Cloud Atlas” is that the principal cast all play multiple roles in order to communicate the idea of transmigrating souls. While much has been made of whether the whiteface and yellowface make-up gimmicks are appropriate, it is more important to note that it forces the audience to acknowledge the actor behind the character. It’s also the perfect thing for a culture that lives for easter eggs and repeat viewings. This trick may be cheap, but it’s also fun. Excluding this misstep, the cast is adequate, if not especially compelling. Most effective are Jim Broadbent as Timothy Cavendish, a bumbling geezer imprisoned in a nursing home against his will; Vivian Ayrs as an aging, brilliant composer; and Hugo Weaving, who plays the villain in every story. Among Weaving’s cold, uncaring characters are a ruthless hitman, a Nurse-Ratchet knockoff weaving in drag, and a manifestation of the Devil named Old Georgie.
“Cloud Atlas” is a film about relativity, since none of the storylines are really effective on their own. Each is a genre piece. 1849 is a sailing piece, 1936 is a quiet drama and a battle between egos, 1973 is a pulp mystery, 2012 is a comedy of errors, 2144 is a sci-fi action film, and the post-apocalypse tale is a story of survival in a harsh, dying world. Even when they share actions, their differences are accented. Cavendish’s escape from the nursing home is intercut with the fabricant Sonmi~451’s escape from the government in 2144. The former is a slaptick comedy, while the latter is dark and foreboding. Comedy equals tragedy plus time. Or minus time. Or something.
The sailing story as well as the two that take place in the future were filmed by the Wachowskis, and it shows. They are heavy on action and set dressing, only settling down for conversation when someone wants to make an extravagant statement or gesture. Tykwer’s middle section fares better, allowing characters to breath a little bit more. But nowhere is truncation of the six storylines clearer than the book’s complicated boardroom espionage of the 1973 storyline that is inelegantly crammed into a handful of expository dialogue from Keith David.
Because of time constraints, none of the stories feel fully realized, none of the characters are fully developed, and all of the arcs feel compressed. But as the film whips from there and back or when the action pauses to get sappy with lines like “All boundaries are waiting to be transcended. My life extends far beyond the limitation of me,” and Tykwer’s score begins to peak and a car plummets off a bridge while a hover bike speeds through traffic, it feels like the film is doing something important. Even if, upon reflection, it’s all just a grandiose, shallow statement.
It’s in this sense that “Cloud Atlas” excels. It is, at best, an intellectually feel-good movie. Yet the act of watching the film—of putting the pieces together, of finding common threads and repeated shots and well-hidden actors, of hearing Tom Hanks talk about life and death and fate—is an entrancing viewing experience. That intangible feeling watching a great film is there, even if that great film is unfortunately absent.

Although it is a coming-of-age story about surfing, “Chasing Mavericks”  is no “Rocket Power.” With a PG rating and a name like “Chasing Mavericks,” we expect a feel-good film with a clichéd plot, a happy ending, and a heavy dollop of cheese to finish it off. The real question, then, is not whether or not the film avoids the saccharine tone that so often plague against-the-odds stories based on true events. The real question is if it adds anything unexpected to a recycled plot. In the case of “Chasing Mavericks,” however, the film’s focus on the power of nature as well as a shocking plot twist rob the viewer of what promised to be a stereotypically fuzzy film and proves surprisingly satisfying.
The plot itself would be at home in any Disney film, if only the director had added in a song-and-dance number. The movie follows the true story of surfer legend Jay Moriarty who died at the age of 22. Moriarty (Johnny Weston) finds a father figure in the bristly Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler), a renowned surfer who sneaks off from his adorable family to catch allegedly mythical waves called Mavericks. Awestruck by the waves, Jay convinces Frosty to teach him how to surf them, leading us on an adventure through high school crushes, best friends on drugs, and one boy’s struggle to “earn his salt.”
The stage is set for two hours of pure, unadulterated sap, and at first, the dialogue certainly delivers the expectedly manufactured emotions characteristic of the Bildungsroman. At one point Frosty’s wife reprimands him, saying, predictably, that Jay will surf the mavericks “even if he dies trying.” Butler does what he can with the script, playing the brooding Californian with a troubled past well, but even he can’t turn the amusingly mediocre writing into filmmaking genius. It also takes more than just slight suspension of disbelief for the audience to accept his attempt at a Californian accent as genuine—the occasional Scottish syllable slips out in his moments of frustration with his young protégé.
Frosty spouts wisdom with the air of a stereotypical surfing guru, stressing the need to bolster the “four pillars” of human strength. “Drive and glide,” becomes the mantra of the film, repeated on end into inanity as the two paddleboard across Half Moon Bay, California, for the half of the movie that doesn’t focus on Jay’s attempts to woo the girl of his dreams.
While the film’s beginning is satisfactorily snort-inducing, the dynamic changes completely at the halfway point as the camera catches wave upon crashing wave paired with a Mazzy Star and Butthole Surfers soundtrack instead of heart-soaring “Sea Willy” tunes and creates scenes that are soaring without being contrived. Underwater camera angles show waves unfurling from the seafloor up, and the film achieves moments of genuine awe. Unfortunately, these beautiful scenes are interspersed with shots of Weston awkwardly fist-pumping, so the cliché is salvaged, if not completely repaired.
However, just as soon as the viewer has recovered from the annoyingly well filmed waves and settled comfortably back into anticipations of further mediocre script writing, an unexpectedly poignant shift occurs between Frosty and Jay following a sudden and truly unanticipated crisis. Finally, Weston breaks from the stereotypical surfer performance, and act he does for the remainder of the film, changing his demeanor from absurdly entertaining into something frustratingly alluring. In this second half of the film, Butler and Weston play well off of each other, supplemented by Jay’s character development. Irony loses out to sympathy, and the film loses its potential status cheesy flick or an epic rewrite of the genre. And, in the end, Directors Apted and Hanson wrap the film up neatly, referencing Moriarty’s life after the Mavericks until his early death, putting a satisfyingly sad bow on this simultaenously awkward and genuinely uplifting film.

When jazz started to move out of smoky nightclubs and into concert halls in the 1940s, many critics bemoaned the genre’s shift away from its “folk roots.” “[Duke Ellington] has robbed jazz of its most basic virtue and lost contact with his audience,” wrote critic and producer John Hammond in 1943 after Ellington’s Carnegie Hall debut. Yet, 70 years later, jazz is essentially a concert-hall genre: its main patrons tend to be older, stodgy connoisseurs who nod along happily to their heroes of the past.
These characteristics were fully on display last Sunday, when pianist Chick Corea and vibraphonist Gary Burton performed at Symphony Hall in Boston. “Yeah, that feels like home,” Corea said as he walked out to a warm applause from the well dressed and respectful audience. For the next two hours, Corea and Burton put on a show that delighted their audience but would have made Hammond cringe. Their arrangements showed utmost taste and virtuosity, but the music lacked the frenzied intensity that characterized early jazz and even the work of Corea’s early career.
The concert showcased songs from Corea and Burton’s new collaborative album, “Hot House,” which is mostly made up of reinventions of standards. Whereas the album’s title track was made famous as a passionate, twisting bebop tune, Corea and Burton performed the song with quiet intellect. They reharmonized the melody and added flourishes, making it even more complex. Their simultaneous soloing, filled with staggering chromatic runs, sounded like Bach counterpoint with a dash of Charlie Parker rather than the other way around.
The next song, Lennon and McCartney’s “Eleanor Rigby,” was a testament to the performing duo’s impeccable arranging abilities. Corea kept steady time with a rolling piano riff, and Burton’s interpretation of the melody was bare and crisp. The steady pulse and style evoked images of lonely, detached people going to work and giving meaningless sermons. The music was able to bring out the song’s poignant lyrics even without the presence of a singer.
Corea and Burton were soon joined by the Harlem String Quartet, who provided intense beauty at some times and pomp at others. On Corea’s “Lyric Suite for Sextet,” the Quartet transitioned straight from tuning their instruments into an atonal swirl; their heavy tone produced to a jarring contrast to the lighter sound of Corea and Burton. Their melodic figures seemed out of place, and the most dynamic sections of the song happened when they dropped out, leaving Corea and Burton room to breathe and dance around each other.
The quartet fared much better on “Adventures of Hippocrates,” another Corea composition. Whether it was stronger songwriting, arrangement, or individual performance, the song possessed a powerful anguish. Violinist Ilmar Gavilan was particularly impressive: on his solo, he treated some runs like a saxophonist would, bending notes and making his violin grown with joyful abandon. The group ended with a majestic unison finish.
To close the concert, the group played a recently composed piece by Corea, “Mozart Goes Dancing,” which is also the closer on “Hot House.” The performance was extremely emblematic of the evening: Burton showed off his unbelievable nimbleness, chopping away with two mallets in each hand; the String Quartet produced a full yet precise sound on menacing melodic runs; Corea once again showed his ability to take in influences and transform them into a breathtaking and original arrangement. However, despite the title, the song was not danceable at all, and was characterized much more by tact than levity. The song fit perfectly into the atmosphere of the grandiose music hall, and the musicians walked off to a standing ovation and shouts of “Bravo!”
Corea and Burton have been performing together for 40 odd years, and they’ve explored the bounds of electric jazz, latin, funk, folk and more. On Sunday, they were just content to play technically dazzling versions of old standards in the comfort of a star-struck concert hall. While they are still superb, it seems as if they’ve found their resting place. It would be unfortunate if jazz as a whole did the same.

Selling out may be the best thing that has ever happened to Calvin Harris. A few years ago, Harris was an obscure DJ toiling away in Scotland at experimental synthpop and electroclash. His switch to more traditional pop sounds on 2008’s “Ready for the Weekend” brought him enormous commercial success and international popularity. Now, Harris has found a formula that not only sells records, but is pristinely produced and infectiously fun. While “18 Months” is at times weighed down by experimental electronica that ties him back to his earlier work, it salvaged by the addictive pop singles that first brought Harris into public view.
Harris has always been known for creating hooks, and on “18 Months” he’s catchier than ever. “We Found Love,” the fourth track and an early single from the album, has become an international hit for that reason. The song starts with a jittery, syncopated keyboard riff and slowly builds as layers of drums and synthesizers are added on. At the climax, the song explodes with energy. Here, his timing is flawless and he creates a perfect backdrop for Rihanna’s voice to soar over.
Another one of Harris’s great strengths is reserve: his beats bounce rather than thunder, setting him apart from many other overzealous dance music producers. In “Let’s Go,” Harris quietly builds up a punchy, uncluttered beat that doesn’t overwhelm after the drop, but rather pulls back so that it has time to build up all over again. On “Bounce,” Harris matches the timbre of Kelis’s breathy voice with a bubbly synth. The build up at the end of the song is one of the most fun moments on the album, as Harris alternates a whining electric noise with silence.
“18 Months” also displays Harris’s more experimental side, with mixed results. In the brief opener, “Green Valley,” Harris throws together layers of swirling synthesizers, vocal samples, and a slap bass. While most of the songs on the album push you to the dance floor, “Green Valley” skillfully rocks you to sleep with sonic waves that swing back and forth.
However, most of his forays into obtuse electronica fall flat. Their lack of development or innovation make it seem that they are simply filler between his top chart singles. “Mansion” features the same irritating beat for two minutes and lacks the satisfying drop that is so essential to Harris’s singles. There is a slight build at the end, led by a bouncy synthetic bass, but the song promptly ends, making for a disappointing finish. “Awooga” is similar, at once empty and overwhelming. Its shiny riff is repeated over and over and then replaced by simulated laser-like shots. Because it is sandwiched between “Let’s Go” and the popping “Thinking About You,” “Awooga” feels especially weak.
Harris also struggles when he tries to force his production technique onto styles of music that aren’t receptive to his method of mixing. “Sweet Nothing,” which was co-written and performed by indie darling Florence Welch, does not reflect the capabilities of either talented collaborator. Welch’s strong vocals are lost in unnecessary vocal effects, and the song, which starts off strong, ends up sounding like a bad club remix of a Florence and the Machine song.
However, Harris succeeds wildly in his more formulaic pop singles. On “18 Months,” Harris may be sacrificing his artistic integrity, but his fans across the world don’t seem to mind too much. What matters is that songs like “Bounce” and “Let’s Go” seem to bore holes inside the brain and nest there, which you don’t realize until your friends tell you to shut up and you didn’t even realize you were singing anything.

R&B singer Abel Tesfaye is often thought of less as a real person and more as a backdrop for sex. His voice, which is seductive enough to make your toes curl, is the centerpiece of a sound that epitomizes babymaking music. But Tesfaye, better known as The Weeknd, arrived in the flesh last Monday at the House of Blues to assert his prowess not only as a singer but also as a live performer. He succeeded, showing off his enormous talent to a packed under-30 crowd that lapped up his sensuality with an appetite atypical for a Monday night.
Tesfaye’s vocal variety and range were beyond possible preconception. Because so much of his music is focused on melodies rather than lyrics, he was able to make significant alterations from the tracks on his albums simply by adding extra trills here and there. His voice was unbelievably high and clear for a male voice, and he also managed to avoid the breathy falsetto trend made popular by indie acts like Bon Iver. Even his ad-libbed improvisations like “Bo-o-osto-on,” came out as effortlessly as exhaling, the sweet vowels dripping with sensuality.
Somehow, he got the whole audience to sing along with his every wordless moan, cry, and cringe-inducing lyric. From the first note of his hit, “High For This,” the audience went wild. The penetrating patterns of his vocal riffs created a visceral experience for the crowd, causing everyone in the eclectic audience to sing and dance along to every soulful proclamation in each verse. Tesfaye himself was completely immersed in his music. Closing his eyes and singing into the microphone with conviction, he seemed to pour his soul into each word.
His songs, as many a song in his genre tend to be, are misogynistic in nature, as was the presentation of his music. Projector screens showed clips of different model-esque girls often wearing nothing but lingerie or revealing only a gap-toothed smile framed by cherry-red lips.
The artificial glamour of the projected vignettes and the images of troubled girls with mascara running down their faces often distracted from the movements onstage. His two female backup singers also did little to assert their presence, tilting their heads from side to side now and then as though they, too, were hypnotized by his performance. However, the concert experience was defined more by his voice than the vulgarity. Sure, he sang about “getting naughty” and “sex in a handbag,” but that didn’t matter in the moment. His voice was just too damn good.
Perhaps knowing how far his voice would take him, Tesfaye was not much of a showman. While many other hip-hop performers use their concerts as a chance to show off their flashy taste in fashion, Tesfaye wore a black puffy jacket and jeans. He rarely made eye contact with members of the audience, and he broke from his trance only to dance and jump around during “Crew Love.” He rarely used his regular speaking voice, if at all, treating the show more like an extended R&B opera. The continuity was interrupted only by a brief space before the encore, which, given the crowd’s response, was practically a guarantee.
As Tesfaye ended the concert majestically, I wondered how many couples were going to have a different kind of encore after the mood he set (indeed, I began to notice people leaving in pairs during the concert). I probably should have been studying for my upcoming midterm instead of going to a Monday night concert, but witnessing such a talented artist completely justified my irresponsible decision. He could have sung “Happy Birthday” and had the crowd weeping for joy.

When Sooni Taraporevala ’79-’80 arrived at Harvard for the first time, art was not high on her agenda. “I came here thinking I would study economics,” she said. “I don’t know why.” Plans changed, and Taraporevala has since established herself as an internationally acclaimed screenwriter, filmmaker, and photographer.
Taraporevala, who is based in Mumbai, has written, among other acclaimed films, the Oscar-nominated “Salaam Bombay!” and an adaptation of  Jhumpa Lahiri’s novel “The Namesake,” both of which were directed by Taraporevala’s frequent collaborator Mira Nair ’79. Taraporevala returned to Harvard last week to present two recent works. “Parsis: The Zoroastrians of India” is a photo collection over 30 years in the making that gives an inside look at the Parsi community to which Taraporevala belongs, a group that follows the prophet Zarathustra. Taraporevala’s 2008 film “Little Zizou,” which was screened at the Harvard Film Archive on Saturday, also depicts the Parsis of Mumbai and is Taraporevala’s first film as both director and writer. “Parsis,” which was originally published as a book in 2000, will be on display in the Carpenter Center’s Sert Gallery through December 20.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you start documenting Parsi life, and when did you decide this was an undertaking that should be presented in a book?
Sooni Taraporevala: When I took time off [from college] and I went home, I took a lot of pictures of my family, and every time I’d go home I’d do that because I grew up in a very large extended family and there was an entire generation I wanted to document. And in ’82 I met [photographer] Raghubir Singh, and he looked at all my work and he suggested I do a book on Parsis, because it had never been done before and I had kind of unique access. So that’s when I consciously started working on it as a body of work—I had been photographing Parsis before that, but much more ad hoc and in a much more personal way.
THC: Why did you feel “Little Zizou” was a story over which you wanted to have a director’s extra control, rather than just screenwriting?
ST: It’s something that was really quirky, and it’s something I knew really well. I didn’t think anyone would know the whole terrain as well as I did, and I didn’t think anyone would be mad enough to keep the quirkiness and not try to fit it into a more formulaic kind of thing.... I wrote roles for [my children] and I wrote roles for specific actors as well. It’s something you’re taught never to do, but I did and it worked out well.
THC: What was it like transitioning from screenwriting alone to writing and directing?
ST: It’s like I’ve tasted blood.... I feel that every screenwriter should have the opportunity to direct one film and every director should write one film so you really know what its like on the other side, because until you do it, it’s kind of hypothetical. It’s only when you’re really doing it that you understand what it’s like to be in that position.... It’s nice to direct; because I had written the script, I was very easy with changing it as it needed to be changed. But every night I would go home and see what we had shot and try to see the big picture, because it’s very easy to lose yourself once you start changing things.
THC: Are there any moments captured in the “Parsis” collection of which you are particularly proud?
ST: I’ve got a lot of people who’ve since passed away, and I’ve had a lot of people who come up to me and say, “That’s my grandfather,” or, “That’s so-and-so.” And often I don’t know who it is, because if it’s a person on the street, I haven’t stopped to talk to them. For instance, I took a picture of two people at the race course and I had no idea who they were, and then I later found out. Basically, I’m happy that I photographed a lot of people before they died.
THC: How did your time at Harvard influence your artistic paths?
ST: I met Mira Nair my sophomore year here...and I took [Osgood Hooker Professor of Visual Arts] Alfred Guzzetti’s filmmaking course, which has stayed with me, actually…. We [students of Guzzetti’s] had to take turns filming each other, and when it was my turn to be filmed, I tried to do a comedy act, and I started out with that, and then midway through it I thought, “I sound completely ridiculous and all that’s on film!” When the film screened in class I was cringing because it was totally embarrassing, but Alfred thought it was an honest moment. And it was the first time that I considered the possibility of honesty on screen being as valuable as performance or virtuosity.

From the ever-so-provocative pen of one Tim M. Hunter ’68—whose takedown of “Rosemary’s Baby” we scorned five weeks ago—comes more fodder for this feature, soon to be retitled in his honor “Letters to a Young Contrarian, Namely Tim Hunter.” In a 1968 Crimson review, Hunter brought his scorched-earth fervor against 1967’s “The Graduate,” as exemplified by his critique:  “[Director Mike] Nichols dabbles in film-making the way Westchester housewives spend their afternoons painting by numbers.” On a related note, Nichols won Best Director for “The Graduate” that year. Hunter’s critique overlooks the subtle self-satire central to Nichols’ melodrama.
Firstly, Hunter demonstrates remarkable foresight of the internet concept of “in b4 the haters”—a phrase used by commentators to predict and defend their claims before the caissons of internet “trolls” start rolling in—by claiming that “‘The Graduate’ ought to be seen, if only to keep tabs on a film that can fool all of the people all of the time.” Reasonably put—if you disagree with Hunter, you are a fool.
Besides granting himself the intellectual legitimacy of Socrates, Hunter also enjoys amateur meta-writing as in his summary statement: “The picture’s potentially promising plot premise purports to be the problem of two people falling in love.” Hunter may be attempting to satirize clichéd devices by using awkward alliteration to reflect a formulaic plot; really, though, it just sounds as if someone is providing a potentially prevaricated picture of his intellectual wick.
Speaking of satire, it seems as if Hunter didn’t understand that “The Graduate” was one. Asking why Dustin Hoffman seems inconsistent throughout the film is like asking why there is no fighting in the War Room; claiming that Nichols is not Hitchcock because not every “shot relates to the film as a whole” is ignoring the film’s theme of meaninglessness and moral drifting in So-Cal culture in the 1960s. Hunter is expecting Fellini in Los Angeles, and calling the filming “self-conscious” due to Nichols not having “enough knowledge of craft to successfully execute [ideas]” when the opening scene is Dustin Hoffman on a moving walkway in LAX floating along to “The Sound of Silence” is, again, missing the point—this film was meant to be self-pitying, a satire, fake insomuch as real. It just seems that while Hunter’s sacrilege might fool all of the people most of the time, he dabbles in writing the way teen photographers frame their best Instagram shots.

“Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,” sings Taylor Swift in the title song of her fourth studio album, “Red.” Swift packs her new album with wonderfully illustrative analogies like this one in an attempt to revisit the topics that command her audience. What is it like to love somebody? To lose them? Swift’s albums try to articulate the answers to these questions by alternating clever, catchy, and upbeat songs with slower, more deliberate ones. Over her past two albums, Swift has slowly distanced her music from the country-pop tone in her eponymous first album to take on a solidly top-40 sound that focused more on heartbreak than on crushes and more on maturation than on youth. “Red” continues the trend: it deals with many of the same issues and features more bubbly pop songs without the twang of her acoustic guitar. But for Swift, more of the same is anything but trite. The tracks on “Red” are catchy and fun (sometimes at the cost of making sense), which, combined with Swift’s genre experimentation on some of her singles, elevates this album to the level of its successful predecessors.
The five singles that Swift released prior to her album release date are perhaps the most innovative tracks on her album. The most notably enjoyable divergences from her normal sound come in “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” “Never Ever,” the album’s first single, has a distinctly upbeat chorus that is driven forward by the insistent repetition of key words. This song is solidly grounded in the realm of pop music as opposed to the country fare that she produced at the beginning of her career, and it affirms that she can hold her own in the genre. The biggest departure from the norm  is “Trouble,” where Swift attempts to incorporate elements of an entirely different genre. The chorus of “Trouble” begins with Swift bouncing up and down her register on alternating syllables and ends with a beat that features a suspicious dubsteppy “wub.” While this change might seem silly at first listen, the song itself is one of the most fun on the album. Though it may be far from the springy acoustic sounds that her fans are used to, the pop fusion tracks are just nuanced enough to make these singles seem refreshing instead of wholly offensive.
The lighthearted, bouncy pop influences do not translate as well to other songs. Her shift to pop is detrimental to the album when her lyrics are not also up to par. A particularly notable offender is “22.” Swift attempts to capture an unbridled moment of youthful happiness in the song but falls short due to the uneventfulness of her narrative. Her idea of a “miserable and magical” night as a 20-something includes “ditch[ing] the whole scene” to dream along with the guy next to her who looks like he’s bad news. Her idealism sounds more like being 22 through the eyes of a 15 year old. “22” seems like a momentary slip in the narrative of realism and tangibility, a mode in which Swift usual excels.
However, “Red” is carried to success by her powerful, heartfelt narratives. Swift shows an impressive range of genuine emotions throughout: there’s rebellious fire in “State of Grace,” euphoria on “Stay Stay,” and of course, plenty of heartbreak. In “All Too Well,” Swift sings “And you call me up again just to break me like a promise / So casually cruel in the name of being honest.” The hurt here is tangible, as her passionate voice and lyrics make her music seem like a shared experience.
“Red” follows the same narrative arc as Taylor Swift’s previous albums. You get the same three resounding messages in all of songs—hopeful, haunting, and deliriously happy—broken up in the same way on her tracklist: always a hopeful start to the album, sadder songs toward the middle, and hopeful songs at the end. Luckily for Swift, similarity becomes an exercise in perfecting an already impressive handle on her genre instead of an exercise in mediocrity. She nuances “Red” just enough to keep herself from being typecast as a songwriter-turned-pop-drone and succeeds in crafting yet another album that will remain relevant mostly because of its poignancy.

Can a play that features an exclusively female cast, regardless of the nature of the roles in the script, be about anything beside gender? Addressing this issue was the task that director Simone E. Polanen ’14 took on when she decided to use only female actors for the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s current production of “The Taming of the Shrew,” which runs at the Loeb Ex until November 3. By having an all-female cast in this misogynistic piece, the production turns traditional sexual norms on their head. Inconsistent acting brings a level of ridiculousness to the show that downplays the narrative of the work and instead focuses entirely on the production’s unique take on gender dynamics.
The play centers on the two daughters of Baptista (Emilie G. C. Thompson, ‘16)—the elder Bianca (Anna A. Hagen, ‘15), beautiful, sweet, and the perfect image of everything feminine, and the younger Katherina (Ema H. Horvath ’16), angry and defiant. Baptista will not allow his older daughter to marry any of her many suitors until a husband has been found for Katherina. The catch, of course, is that no one wants to marry her—that is, until Petruchio (Olivia L. Ball ’14) comes to town. As Petruchio is faced with “taming the shrew,” as it were, all of Bianca’s various suitors are plotting against each other and causing general chaos.
The set is simple, and the setting—post-World-War-II America—doesn’t add much to the play. The jazz music between scenes seemed slightly unnecessary. On the whole, the technical aspects were not particularly memorable; at times they were even sloppy. Transition music came in during the middle of scenes, and set changes were poorly organized, both boring and distracting the viewer.
However, the acting partially redemed the show. Horvath and Ball, as the leading couple, do a truly tremendous job of portraying their characters. Ball surpasses the gender barrier between herself and her role, not by becoming masculine in affect, but rather with subtle eyebrow flicks and sincere amusement. She delivers her monologue at the end of Act 1 sitting by herself on a trunk with legs apart—but not too much. She brings out the insidious political subtexts in the speech, adding new-found depth to her character.  Her gender actually became a non-issue. Horvath, too, easily surpasses the other actresses, jutting out her chin and stomping around in heels. She really shines during the scenes where she is being “tamed.” She is able to communicate this transition with nuance and restraint: during a scene where Petruchio offers her a hamburger—an implicit symbol of his dominance—her body language conveys the inner conflict between independence and submission.
However, it is not always possible to believe the rest of the characters. The oversized jackets, wigs, and hats distracted from the acting in many cases, and as none of the actresses disguised their voices there was never any chance to forget these character’s gender duality. Many of the actress es struggle to convincingly portray men. On some level, that was part of the point of the show. However, in many cases it was distracting. In one scene where all the male characters were onstage, what could have been a Shakespearean bro-fest fell short as all of the actresses seem to be performing caricatures as opposed to realistic portrayals of men.
When Petruchio enters for his wedding to Katherina wearing a bright yellow suit with rhinestones, the absurdity really escalates. The second act serves to mock the sexist nature of the play. The balance between outrageous scenes and plain scenes is fairly well struck, and the production focuses on exploring gender relations even during the show’s most ridiculous moments. At every turn, though, the all-female cast emphasizes the absurdity of traditional gender roles at the cost of the narrative.
The directing was generally smart. Once Petruchio tamed Katherina, she takes off her heels and walked barefoot. A simple directing choice, but powerful in its simplicity, this moment has something that the rest of the play doesn’t—quiet. Filled with loud, boisterous scenes, raging screams at entrances and exits, and incredibly rapid dialogue, the play really gained strength at moments of relative calm.
Neither Ball nor Horvath transcended their gender entirely—nor did any other actress. Gender simply became an inverted concept and because of its ubiquity this switch lost its power in this production. Precisely because of its consistent presence in how one views the play, gender bending becomes the takeaway from the show.

“This song is about verb tenses.” John Darnielle, the leader of The Mountain Goats, took to the stage at the House of Blues in Boston on Oct. 18 to the resounding cheers of the grammar geeks and lonely hearts in the audience. “You all know the phrase, ‘Live to fight another day?’” Darnielle went on to explain that while the point of the cliché is that a person will persevere into tomorrow, he views it more antagonistically: “You will live to fight. What will you fight? Another day!”
It was an appropriate introduction for an artist with such remarkable lyrical chops. In 2005, the New Yorker billed Darnielle as “America’s best non-hip-hop lyricist,” and this description has a vast ocean of musical evidence to support it. His songs are short, usually only two to four minutes, and pack emotional punches whose raw yearning and unapologetic darkness are nearly tangible. From his beginnings as a college student in Southern California doing home recordings on a boom box, Darnielle has put out 14 albums, as well as countless songs and singles, many of which are either extremely rare or lost altogether.  His songs have a unique style that can best described as manic—the lyrics are complex, profound, and nearly busting through the seams of the spare guitar chords that usually hold them together.
Darnielle’s work is full of bitter longing punctuated by moments of pure, almost painfully sharp joy. In his song “Broom People” from his 2005 autobiographical album “The Sunset Tree,” he describes a depressing home environment—“White carpet thick with cat hair / Half eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer”—before going on to add his own self-consciously bald despair: “I write down good reasons to freeze to death / In my spiral ring notebook.”  He answers this decidedly dark and grimy reality with a yelp of desperate love: “But in the long tresses of your hair / I am a babbling brook.” In this last moment of alliterative romance, Darnielle’s voice seems to unhinge itself from reality, breaking into a forceful, lingering cry that stays with listeners long past the song’s ending. And indeed, when Darnielle performed “Broom People” on Thursday night, the final line of the song brought forth raucous cries of empathy from the audience.
The audience at the House of Blues on Thursday night was populated by deeply devoted listeners of Darnielle’s canon. Most of the concert was more of a feverish singalong between Darnielle and the audience as opposed to a straight performance.  When Darnielle played one of his most famous songs, the stunning “This Year,” the crowd became nearly electric, bouncing off one another as they shouted along to the anthemic chorus, “I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me.”
For all the honest tragedy and grueling depression that Darnielle sings about, his stage presence was shockingly upbeat. As he shouted about failed marriages and satanic worship, Darnielle heel kicked across the stage with a wicked grin reminiscent of the quintessential bad boy in teen comedies. In the rare moments where his smile fell away, Darnielle’s energy certainly didn’t flag—instead, he would enter a kind of seizing, full-body shake that made his jaw look as if it was about to drop from his face.
Darnielle’s performance of “Up the Wolves,” also from “The Sunset Tree,” captured the energy of the concert as a whole in a few short, intense minutes. As Darnielle launched into his powerful, heart-clenching lyrics, “I’m gonna bribe the officials / I’m gonna kill all the judges / It’s gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage,” the audience shouted, shook, and fist-pumped along with him. Thursday’s show took Darnielle’s audience on a trip through tragedy, pain, and sickness, without ever losing view of the fact that, at least for The Mountain Goats, there is always value in continuing to fight.

“When an atheist finds himself walking around after death, he has some serious re-evaluating to do,” says the ghost of the Tiger (Rick Park) while musing on the nature of life and death and exploring the ruins of Baghdad. As the Tiger ambles in and out of the shells of fashionable town houses and public institutions he realizes that combat leaves behind more than just bodies and spent shell-casings: the souls of the dead also comprise the detritus of war. Such metaphysical themes are at the heart of Rajiv Joseph’s “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo”––a show nominated for the 2010 Pulitzer Prize that is running at the Plaza Theatre through November 17––and Company One’s production of the show emphasizes these elements through the quality of some key cast members. The acting is sometimes sometimes spotty, but “Bengal Tiger” is driven along by Park’s standout performance that highlights the script’s nuances.
“Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo” follows veterans of the War in Iraq––both military and civilian––as they try to comprehend the meaning of events far larger than themselves. Each (living) character is haunted by the ghosts of their past: For example, the U.S. Marine Kev (Michael Knowlton) is forced to put up with the incessant philosophizing of the Tiger (Rick Park), an animal he shot after it bit off the hand of his buddy Tom (Ray Ramirez). Iraqi translator Musa (Michael Dwan Singh) is hounded by the spirit his old employer, the infamous Uday Hussein (Mason Sand). As each character is haunted by their own demons, they are forced to examine the meaning of life and the nature of redemption in the ruined city of Baghdad.
Park gives by far the best performance in the production. The show is for the most part framed by the Tiger’s spiritual and philosophical growth, and Park captures this transformation by adding depth to his character. Many performers would try to portray a role’s evolution—i.e. from atheist to spiritual believer—as linear. Instead, Park builds on top of the emotional foundation that his character already has without shedding the feelings that defined him in the first place. The Tiger starts out as an secular cynic, and he never really loses his cynicism, even as he begins to question his previous views on the nature of death. Some of the Tiger’s funniest, most cynical moments come during scenes when he is undergoing a philosophical transformation, like when he realizes that even something as common as lunch––which, as the Tiger admits during a monologue, does occasionally involve eating children––can have moral ramifications. This is a tricky transition to pull off, but through a combination of impeccable comedic timing and raw emotion Park makes it vivid and believable.
However, not all the acting is as solid as Park’s. Ramirez and Knowlton both struggle to capture the nuances that drive their respective characters. They are convincing during moments of great turmoil, but they have trouble showing how their characters moved from stability to inner conflict. For example, Ramirez’s final appearance at the end of the play is very well executed, but none of his proceeding scenes display the emotional growth that would make his demise truly shattering. Instead, he goes from calm and cool in the beginning to desperate and despondent at the end with very little change in the middle.
The set is sparse––not surprising given the confined space of the Plaza Theatre––and consists of a wrought-iron gate and a gunpowder blackened brick archway. The different settings were portrayed through the lighting design, and designer Jen Rock uses different lights at various intensities to capture the changing settings. This simple feature allows the production to effectively switch from the dingy interior of a house to the bright sunshine of the Arabian desert without any clunky set changes. The directing of the show is handled with the same light touch. Nothing about it is particularly showy, and the lack of technical frills allows the depth of the script to be fully explored.
“Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo” is a phenomenal piece of modern drama, and it handles the intricacies of the Iraq war with a refreshing mix of humor and honesty. Company One’s production of the play for the most part succeeds in capturing this complexity, and while the cast sometimes only offers a superficial reading of the characters, the production’s best moments provide a beautifully executed examination of the moral and philosophical implications of destruction.

In classical ballet, the male dancers are usually nothing more than glorified chairs and ladders in tights. While they are occasionally showcased in brief solos and pas de deux (a duet for two dancers, typically a male and female), they exist primarily to showcase the ballerina. They lift her while she dances and stand there as she spins. It is rare to see a male ballet dancer take center stage, but the Boston Ballet does an amazing job showcasing their male dancers in their Fall Program this season.
The program features three contemporary ballet pieces that push the boundaries of the classical ballet convention. By taking an innovative spin on themes, narratives, and gender roles, the Boston Ballet successfully reinterprets the traditions of classical ballet, presenting a thought-provoking Fall Program that is thoroughly enjoyable for both ballet connoisseurs and newcomers to the art form.
The opening piece, Christopher Bruce’s “Rooster,” is danced entirely to music by the Rolling Stones and sets the stage for the show’s wonderfully iconoclastic display of ballet. The dance features an unusual gestural phrase in which the men literally strut like roosters and occasionally stop to slick back their hair in a very Elvis-esque style. This slightly unnerving movement is repeated and alluded to throughout the entire piece, developing it into a comforting recurring thread that ties the piece’s eight dances together. This masculinized phrase material combined with Rolling Stones music paints “Rooster” as a dance about the American mating ritual from the male perspective that makes the male dancers the true stars of the show.
One of the most stunning and memorable dances was “Paint it Black,” featuring a lone male dancer partnered by three women. This innovatively choreographed dance directly contradicts ballet’s traditional partnering style and allows the male dancer to truly showcase his talent and technique. Instead of the standard gender roles, the male dancer is the soloist, and the three women lift, spin, and turn him. This creative choreography luxuriates and showcases the male dancer in a refreshing and inventive way.
The second piece was the world premiere of Jorma Elo’s ballet “Awake Only.” Of the three pieces, Elo’s choreography is the most traditional of the ballets in the Fall Program, and uses music, stage setting, and costuming simply but skillfully to convey a profound message and narrative.
The piece is about a young man meeting his past and future selves in a dream, which coninues the Ballet’s male-centric trend. Like “Rooster,” Elo’s main dancers are all men: a child, a young man, and an adult. Costume designer Charles Heightchew uses simple outfits to link these three male dancers. The little boy wears pajamas, the young man wears a body suit, and the adult is bare-chested with tights. While all of these outfits are different, they are made from the same patterned material, which suggests to the audience that these are all the same man.
Elo uses the silence between dance numbers to tell the main narrative story. When the music ends and the dancers stop, the men interact with one another. The little boy takes the young man by the hand and leads him across the stage. The young man holds his adult counterpart and teaches him how to move. The ultimate effect of these moments contribute to the piece’s larger theme that maturation is not necessarily a linear process.
Jeffrey Cirio, the young man and principal soloist in “Awake Only,” is a breathtaking dancer with a moving stage presence. He leaps in his first solo with a powerful pas de chat en tournant, and throughout the dance lands all of his intricate jumps soundlessly and effortlessly. But beyond Cirio’s beautiful technique and stunning lines, he has a striking charisma onstage. He masterfully conveys joy, ecstasy, and loss all whilst flying through the air. This combination of talents makes Cirio the perfect star of this profound piece and adds a level of gravitas to the dance that only a truly skilled dancer can execute.
William Forsythe’s piece “The Second Detail” ends the Fall Program on a controversial note. It is by far the most unconventional dance in the program and uses stark sets, sleek costumes, and jarring music to shake the audience and force them to draw their own conclusions. Forsythe pairs powerful movements with the strong down beats of his odd-but-climatic music to emphasize dancer’s sharp and beautiful phrases.
Unlike the other dances, “The Second Detail” does not follow any distinct narrative, making it hard for the audience to emotionally connect with the dance. But at the same time, this lack of didactic story allows the audience to pull their own individualized conclusions from the piece. Thus, “The Second Detail” is either the perfect or worst ending to the program. It either leaves the audience yearning and working for a conclusion, or completely confused and discombobulated.
However, the Boston Ballet presents a beautifully choreographed and wonderfully performed Fall Program that pushes the boundaries of the classical ballet traditions. The show does a great job at showcasing the male dancers and goes so far as to cast them as the gender transgressive “prima ballerinas.” The final piece—while confusing at times and galvanizing at others—ties the show up nicely, completing the theme of reinterpretation of traditional ballet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Guy Mendilow Ensemble’s latest musical program, “Tales From the Forgotten Kingdom,” is full of contradictions—and that’s exactly how they like it. In a performance at Kirkland House on October 25, the ensemble tackled the ancient world of Ladino music (songs rooted in Sephardi Jewish culture), challenging centuries-old traditions, including melody, arrangement, and attitude towards the art form by reinterpreting its sound in a way that preserves its integrity.
Ladino, a Romance language originally spoken by Sephardi Jews (who were expelled from Spain and Portugal in the late 15th century), houses a rich and varied musical history. This is due mostly to the language’s presence in many distinct locales. Sephardi Jews settled in locations as widespread as Damascus, Sarajevo, Alexandria, and Rhodes, opening the Ladino language and culture to a staggering range of influences. Because of he diferent influences, Ladino songs often sound like an amalgamation of traditions as diferent as epic Spanish romances, Bosnian sevdalinkas, and the down-tempo folk dances of Thessaly.
In their live performance, the Guy Mendilow Ensemble provided a decidedly modern and liberal take on the Ladino musical tradition, introducing instruments, techniques, and arrangements that, as Mendilow noted several times, “have really nothing whatsoever to do with Ladino culture,” including the Brazilian berimbau, the alto saxophone, and the clarinet. Furthermore, Ladino music isn’t designed for many performers. It was usually sung a cappella by women while they were doing housework. However, while Mendilow wasn’t too concerned with staying faithful to the stylistic confines of traditional Ladino music, he did work tirelessly to convey the music’s mood and spirit as accurately as possible.
“I have a responsibility to do my homework, and to do a lot of it.… Any time a musician engages with a tradition and does something that isn’t a part of the tradition already, there are some questions and responsibilities. When arranging a song, the first thing I do is a lot of reading, as well as interviews with experts in Ladino culture,” Mendilow said.
However, when dealing with such old and varied source material, producing a single, “correct” version of any given song can be a nearly impossible task, necessitating some original work by the arranger, Mendilow said.
“We’re playing a game of bizarre telephone, a game of echoes of echoes of echoes.… It begins with traditional material but very quickly springboards into an area that’s…linked to the Ladino tradition but is as much the composer’s domain as anything. Sometimes this leads to keeping the melody faithful, but sometimes it leads to a recomposing of the melody.”
The group’s somewhat untraditional sound is also a product of its members’ musical backgrounds. While Mendilow grew up with Ladino music during his childhood in Israel, none of the other five members of the ensemble had any experience with it prior to meeting Mendilow. Andy Bergman, a Berklee School of Music graduate, ehcoed this idea.
“My own background doesn’t really inform me about Sephardi music,” Bergman said. “I’m more familiar with Ashkenazi music and Klezmer.”
Lead vocalist Aubrey Johnson echoed Bergman but noted that her musical background is even further from Ladino music. “I’ve been singing jazz, pop, and R&B my whole life,” Johnson said. “I wish I could authentically do what Ladino singers do, but I can also do my own interpretation on it, which is a fun challenge for me.” Johnson demonstrated this willingness to put her own spin on the music in the show’s closing song, during which she scatted a variation of an intricate Ladino melody with ease.
During the rest of the performance, the music’s literary basis was constantly at the forefront. Between songs, Mendilow frequently elaborated upon the meaning of the songs’ adventurous and passionate lyrics in fairytale fashion, possibly setting a record for the number of times the phrase “Once upon a time” has been said at a concert.
However, Mendilow also explained the mood and emotions associated with the Ladino tales through his imaginative arrangements, heavily using percussion and vocal techniques to convey the eerie mood of many of the tales. For example, during “Una Noche Al Borde De La Mar,” which focuses on a sailor’s lonely sea voyage to exile, percussionists Kieta Ogawa and Tareq Rantisi used chimes, triangles, and shakers to produce a swirling, bleak sonic landscape that evoked the sounds produced by the wind and the ocean. Meanwhile, Mendilow and Johnson combined in a distant, echoing duet that captured the loneliness and uncertainty of the narrator. In honing in on these powerful emotions, Mendilow actually departs from traditional attitudes towards Ladino music.
“Traditionally, these songs were somewhere between a talk show and a soap opera…. They weren’t intended to be taken seriously, even though they’re really dramatic. I love to get into them as if they were for real and bring the drama out,” Mendilow said.
Ladino is a dying language—fewer than two hundred thousand people currently speak or understand it, and most of those people are elderly. It’s very rare to find Ladino taught in schools, even in Israel. However, due to the efforts of groups like the Guy Mendilow Ensemble, ancient culture surrounding the language will be preserved, even if the music itself is a product of modern ideas.

Agassiz theater
Directed by Katherine E. Moon '14
Produced by Anne E. M. McGrath '13, Amelia H. Ross '14, and Allison A. Ray '14
In a theater season dominated by dark musicals like “Next to Normal” and “Sweeney Todd,” the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of the comic operetta “The Mikado” is a definite change of pace. The story, which follows the love between Nanki-Poo, heir to the throne of Japan, and Yum-Yum, a schoolgirl, is rife with absurd plot twists and outlandish circumstances.
“We wanted to do an extremely historically faithful show,” said stage director Katherine E. Moon ’14. Moon’s desire to keep to the original extends beyond the acting to both the production’s aesthetic—the show includes Japanese dance fans and hand-made costumes—and its light-hearted spirit. For example, a few of the jokes were tweaked to keep the humor fresh. The song “As Someday It May Happen,” for example, is a list of people one of the characters finds obnoxious, and this production’s rendition includes “the hipster from the suburbs who wears all those gaudy clothes /and won’t admit to liking things that anybody knows.” The show, which runs through the weekend of The Harvard-Yale Game, also manages to sneak in a few Yale jokes.
The production is also technically innovative. “Because we are a group that has such a small canon of productions, we put a lot of resources and a lot of thought and energy into the technical aspects,” said Chris M. Wankel ’13, a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players and this production’s Mikado. Indeed, the ambitious set includes a massive cherry tree, pagodas, and a river that required the construction of a raked stage. The music is just as complicated. “Sullivan wrote pretty complex melodies and harmonies. There’s a particular song where George Baxter, Eli Kahn, and I sing a trio, the lyrics to which are actually a tongue twister,” said Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16, who plays Ko-Ko.
Laura A. Peterson ’16, who plays Katisha, noted that elements of “The Mikado” are more ingrained in popular culture than people realize. “I knew the opening, ‘If You Want to Know Who We Are,’ and ‘Three Little Maids,’ [but] I didn’t realize they were from this. There’ve been a lot of those moments.” Peterson also praised the play’s fun spirit, calling it a “showy show.” Hilgartner agreed: “It isn’t nearly as stuffy as I think people imagine it to be. The comedy remains fresh to this day, the music is fun—it’s just a great, fun, silly musical.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 1
An earlier version of this article misstated several facts about the production. The show will run Nov. 2 to 18 in the Agassiz Theatre. Katherine E. Moon ’14 is the stage director; Ethan T.

When Cyril Wilcox, a member of the Class of 1922, committed suicide, he could not have known the impact his death would have on the Harvard community. He could not have known that it would instigate a witch-hunt that led to the expulsion of gay students at the University. He could not have known that it would lead to the betrayal and vicious degradation of his closest friends. And he definitely could not have known that nearly a century later someone would write a play based on these events.
Wilcox never makes an appearance as a character in playwright Tony Speciale’s 2011 work, “Unnatural Acts”—which was read by members of the American Repertory Theater Institute and was followed by panel discussion on Oct. 22 at Farkas Hall. The play instead focuses on his friends, who were expelled based entirely on their presumed sexual orientation. The story of this witchhunt was forgotten until a Crimson editor uncovered an 80-year old box containing the court records in the University archives in 2002.
Speciale says he wrote “Unnatural Acts” as a way to make sure these student’s stories are never forgotten. “I was drawn to the notion of being able to create a memorial or requiem for them,” Speciale says. Thus, the play gives a voice to the students silenced by Harvard’s history, but at the same time it grants the audience a concrete moment in time that allows them to see how Harvard has changed.
The Harvard that Speciale paints in 1920 can be seen as both a place of joy and fear. “There’s a lot of love, sensuality, happiness, and ecstasy in it. And you get to know the boys that way and fall in love with them,” Speciale says. “And the second half of the play is just the harsh reality of what it means when a group of people is born ahead of their time and has to face society. And Harvard is just a lens through which we see society at that time.” In the second part of the play, the boys are singled out, savagely interrogated, and made to testify against one another.
The production implicitly juxtaposes the University’s views on sexual diversity 90 years ago with its stance now. “The show does a really good job at letting us infer how far [Harvard has] come,” says Justin S. Pereira ’13, who saw the play last Monday. James Lecesne, founder of the Trevor Project—a suicide prevention hotline for LGBTQ youth—and panelist at the read-through of “Unnatural Acts” agrees. “I think young people looking at this play can see it as an artifact and indication of how far we’ve come,” Lecesne says.
Back when Wilcox committed suicide and his friends were expelled, Harvard was a place where homosexuality was seen as a “disease.” Like all illnesses, homosexuality was to be quarantined and eradicated. Speciale believes the boys turned against each other because they were made to feel entirely alone. “They [didn’t] have a group of people that they [could] talk to or support. It is all about community,” he says.
Today, Harvard provides a much more accepting community for its LGBTQ students, although there are still problems.  Ben K. Moss ’13, an openly gay student at Harvard, played Stanley Gilkey in the Monday read-through of “Unnatural Acts.” He feels that Harvard has come a long way since the ’20s. “I do not feel at jeopardy at all of being expelled from the school for being who I am,” Moss says. “I would be really dismayed if any student at Harvard felt like it wasn’t a safe place to come out.” Similarly, Dana Knox, the Production Coordinator and Adviser for College Theater Programs at Harvard, believes that being gay has become less of an issue amongst the faculty. “It is a very gay-friendly environment. I myself am a gay administrator and feel there are resources available to me should I need them. I feel that the administration is very supportive and embracing of diversity issues,” says Knox. The University has a variety of student-run queer organizations as well as a BLGTQ resource center with its own full time Director of BLGTQ Student Life, Vanidy Bailey.
However, while Harvard has been painting a brighter future for its current students, some say it has failed to sufficiently make amends for its past injustices. The University has expressed regret for its homophobic and hateful actions in the past, but a student-run organization called “Their Day in the Yard” has called upon the University to award posthumous degrees to the wrongfully expelled students. While Harvard has progressed, for some the institution’s inaction in this regard calls into question its stance on this already dark and secretive chapter of its history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Macklemore’s career as a mainstream rapper was aided by the release of “Thrift Shop,” his hit single. His rise to fame may signal the birth of a new and original rapper for some. For others, his work may be nothing more than cleverly-disguised tedium.
Point By Alexander Tang
PRO: Washington state is an area best known musically for its indie/alternative darlings, from twee superstars Fleet Foxes and Death Cab for Cutie to greats like Nirvana and Soundgarden. Ben Haggerty, better known as Macklemore, is one of the few exciting hip-hop artists to come from the Evergreen State. He released his debut album, “The Heist,” on October 9th, and it rose to #1 on the iTunes download charts. The Heist also debuted on the US Billboard 200 at #2 of the week of October 27th. While commercial success often does not overlap perfectly with musical talent, Macklemore lounges comfortably in the center of this Venn diagram.
“The Heist” is a refreshing mix of cautiously serious and infectiously cheery tracks. Songs like “Wing$,” in warning against the dangers of consumerism, threaten to become preachy, but Macklemore is able to rein them back into the realm of sincerity by grounding them in solid storytelling. He raps a first verse that could read like a stirring monologue about his obsession with Nike sneakers as a child, and ends the song with the sentiment, “This dream that they sold to you / For a hundred dollars and some change / Consumption is in the veins / And now I see it’s just another pair of shoes.
Macklemore deftly switches his tone from songs like this and his appeal for gay rights in “Same Love” to lines like “Walk up to the club, like ‘What up? I got a big cock,’” in “Thrift Shop,” a song with a weapons-grade catchy beat and devastating comedic timing. Macklemore oozes charisma through every line of the song, equal parts bravado and wit as he delivers gems in his ode to thrifting such as, “Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me / Probably should have washed this, smells like R. Kelly’s sheets, pissssss.”
Ultimately, what separates Macklemore from the horde of unremarkable Generation Y pre-millenials vying for success is his sparkling execution and pristine production. Rarely does he ever resort to inversions or contortions to force his meter or rhyme, and his flow never suffers for it. Each line reads as fluidly as prose as it does in time, and it stands against a beautiful backdrop of live instrumentation and tasteful beats. The use of strings, horns, and especially acoustic piano are the perfect complement to Macklemore’s effortless delivery and candid lyrics. Macklemore is an artist just as fit for provoking serious thought as provoking serious grooves.

Rebuttal By Andrew R. Chow
Macklemore may try to strike a balance between serious thoughts and serious grooves, but its unclear if he even knows where that balance is. Instead, it seems he compartmentalizes the two sides to sell off to two different audiences. This is extremely apparent on back-to-back tracks late in “The Heist.” “White Walls” is a painfully inane ode to his Cadillac, with lyrics like “In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C bitch / Can’t see me through my tints / I’m riding real slow.” If it’s a parody, it’s hard to tell—he even employs gangsta rapper Schoolboy Q to drop the stereotypical verse about cars, women, and cocaine. The very next track, he turns around and skewers the record industry for stealing profits and diluting artistic identity. Is all of his music genuine? Is he forcing his party side or his socially conscious side? Will the real Macklemore please stand up?
Counterpoint By Andrew R. Chow
CON: A couple of weeks ago, I received an email from a dear friend of mine who badly wanted to see some new rapper at the House of Blues. “I’m grooving real hard to Macklemore lately,” he wrote. “It should be an insanely fun show.” He linked a song by the rising rapper, and for the next three minutes, I was as hooked as he was. “Thrift Shop” grabbed me right from the opening funk-tastic sax riff and held on all the way through its coat-flinging, onesie-rocking climax. Here was a fresh new rapper, I thought, who had innovative production, a nasty flow, and a sense of humor all at the same time.
Nope. I wish I had ended my interest in Macklemore right there, because a large portion of his music is insufferably generic and uninspired. Rather than cutting against the grain, the Seattle-based rapper slides right into the horde of college-rap pretenders who have come to dominate dorm-room parties for the past few years. His production is largely the opposite of funky: plodding piano chords, treacly synthesizers, and familiar-sounding drum machine beats that are good mostly for jumping up and down and pumping a fist in the air. His choruses are dominated by extremely general, faux-inspirational sentiments: “This is the moment / Tonight is the night / We’ll fight till it’s over.”
Macklemore’s rapping itself is equally disappointing. He becomes trite and heavy handed on his slower songs and vacuous on his party anthems. "Make the money, don't let the money make you / Change the game don't let the game change you," he declares proudly, as if this was an original or clever line.
Now, I am well aware that music is allowed to (and at times should) be simple and fun, and that Macklemore raps about important topics like same-sex equality and drug abuse. But the style and material all feel heavily tread upon, and it is a shame that a man so clearly capable of personality could get squeezed into the mold and stripped of identity so easily. “David Bowie meets Kanye shit?” Not quite.

Rebuttal by Alexander Tang
I disagree that Macklemore phases into the formless mass of mediocre frat rappers. The production on The Heist may venture from funky at times, but I posit that it ventures into other territories such as tastefully-reserved and refreshingly-clean. The most striking example of this is the track “Bombom,” which displays a degree of instrumental experimentation seldom found on hip-hop albums. While I would admit that Macklemore does not possess a Wilde-esque command of language, nor does he harbor any Shakespearean philosophic revelations, but I argue that he does more than well enough to create a compelling rap album.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Belmont Starbucks at 8 a.m. on a Wednesday morning is not a soulful place, but still it has its rhythm. Mothers on autopilot pick up their coffee, baristas correct orders of medium with murmurs of “Grande,” and high school girls anticipate the rest of their day and caffeinate. Michael Reavey has his rhythm, too. The trumpet player of local soul band The Chicken Slacks arrives a full 15 minutes earlier to our interview than musicians are supposed to (15 minutes late) and leaves on the hour to prepare for the work of the day; Reavey also teaches music lessons. For The Chicken Slacks, Wednesdays have meant the same thing for the past seven years: the day before the Thursday night gig at the Cantab Lounge.
At first glance, The Chicken Slacks may seem like any other wedding band—an assumption only encouraged by their appearance as a generic wedding band in the film “Bride Wars.” Yet this is not a group that only plays affirming, anesthetized soul music at the bar mitzahs and weddings of the nostalgic. Though playing at the same bar every week for seven years is not glamorous, that gig is what separates The Chicken Slacks from the average cover band. While their primary goal is to entertain, they are committed to the preservation of soul and its authentic presentation, and it is this mission that they carry out for three sweaty, alcoholic hours every Thursday into the wee small hours of the morning.
IT’S YOUR THING
In 2001, Justin Berthiaume, founder and former drummer of The Chicken Slacks, was a full-time musician in Boston. Contrary to popular belief, full time musicians are not either starving or Taylor Swift. More often, those doing music professionally make a living by giving music lessons or playing one-off gigs as a sub for local bands. Michael Duke, the guitarist in the Slacks, occasionally teaches at Berklee College of Music. Jeremy Valadez, the band’s saxophonist and musical director, is an expressive arts therapist in training. Back in 2001, Berthiaume was well-established in the blues rock scene, but even with a solid living he found something lacking.
“I was a drummer around town and I wanted to take it to the next level and be one of the best musicians in town if I could,” explains Berthiaume via Skype from San Francisco, where he now teaches environmental science at a public charter high school. “I started getting into the blues scene, and so we would play a lot of blues numbers at clubs…. But whenever we’d play a soul tune like ‘Mustang Sally’ or ‘Soul Man,’ everybody would get up and dance—it was mayhem. And when we’d go back to playing blues everybody would sit down. And I thought if I played soul music all night, people would dance all night…. If I could play this music with a big band, I’d have kind of a niche here. And it turned out to be right.” Berthiaume began looking for musicians as committed to soul as he was.
His friend, the lead singer of a funk disco band called Booty Vortex who goes by the stage name Kit Holliday, remembers it differently. She met me at a Starbucks a few blocks from the company where she is a network infrastructure engineer. Despite her impressive resume, her greatest talent is her ability to say “Booty Vortex” with a straight face. “Justin was working with a power trio that was sort of blues that went to blues-rock/experimental, and I think that he was maybe looking for something to balance that out. And maybe make some money,” Holliday says. “Because if you’re doing original experimental stuff, you know, you’re getting 30 bucks a night at Toad for each guy in the band.”
The Chicken Slacks started out small. Originally, it was just Berthiaume, his friend Mighty Slim, and a bassist named Jehu. They would hole up in the Music Complex, an old rehearsal space that’s now been divided into condos. “Us three just worked out James Brown grooves for hours,” Berthiaume says. When their first lead singer, Big Daddy Dave, joined the group, they rehearsed and bonded for a year before they had their first gig.
Though one year may seem an excessive amount of rehearsal, the group has always been built on dedication to the original material and workmanlike consistency. “When you’re a musician in Boston, there is a lot of switching around, and I always wanted a band that would get together every week,” Berthiaume says. “Any kind of negativity we wouldn’t really stand for. I think setting a work ethic like that and an expectation of devotion, we were able to keep a consistent quality to the show.”
In 2005, the band played their first show at the Cantab. Stephen Ramsey of the Cantab Lounge gave a suitably gruff explanation of his decision to hire the group: “You want to know about the band? Ask the customers. I know why I hired them—they’re a great band.” And if the audience’s lack of inhibition is any indication, it seems that the Cantab sells a lot of alcohol, too.
Rick Rosco, the current bassist, joined the group a year and a half after their founding and played at the first Cantab gig. Currently, he’s the most senior member of the group and one of the only members who grew up as soul was first entering the mainstream. A technical writer by day and soul bassist by night (the designation “international man of mystery” was also thrown around), Rosco embodies the group’s commitment to having both young and old musicians play together. The mix allows for the dynamic between enthusiastic discovery and fond memory, which drives the band. With a few exceptions, Rosco has played for the full length of the Cantab residency—a seven-year stretch broken only for Thanksgivings. “It’s a good feeling,” he reflects. “It just feels like coming home.”
“ANOTHER DAMN THURSDAY"
The Cantab is often called a “dive bar,” and depending on which of the three Thursday Chicken Slacks sets you hear, the term is either a romantic wish or a dramatic understatement. At 8 p.m. on Thursday, an hour before the show starts, the bar is nearly empty save for a few customers and the two bartenders, Amanda and Chris. It smells of alcohol, wood, and something disconcertingly unidentifiable. The band members trickle in over the course of the hour and greet each other familiarly. Tracy “Sweet Tea” Fontes, the lead singer, arrives with his brother. Valadez, the saxophone player and emcee, stands with his back to the nearly non-existent crowd and riffs over Sam Cooke’s “Cupid” on the jukebox. The crowd is mostly regulars, most of them old enough to know the music from their youth. As the small crowd picks up drinks and settles in at the tables, the band slowly assembles on stage. At 9:30, Jeremy leans into the mic, and with a “Hi y’all!” the group kicks into two casual instrumental grooves. Fontes lingers towards the back as the older crowd nods along. At the end of the second number, Fontes strides from the back across an empty floor as if it were the house at the Apollo and begins to belt Eddie Floyd’s “634-5789.” His voice is excellent—reminiscent of Stevie Wonder and Cee Lo Green in its odd combination of clarion high tones and pinching husk—and as he sings, the crowd grows and a few younger patrons begin to dance. The band’s music tightens around his performance. By the end of the first set, the bar is packed.
Each show is a strange combination of new and old. The Cantab has a cheesy clock on the wall, which looks as if all its numbers have fallen off the face and collected at the bottom of the frame. “Who Cares?” is written across the middle. The bar on Thursdays seems outside of time—the music is from decades ago, the band spans generations, and the young and old dance together.
Reavey reflects at the end of the night that the three sets were practically different shows. The first was a pleasant experience shared with an older audience: the group breezed through laidback numbers like “Groove Me,” “It’s Your Thing,” and “You Send Me.” But by the time they began the second set, a college Halloween party recently exiled from a nearby bar had arrived, and the Cantab was so packed with superheroes, half-naked police officers, princesses, and aliens that grinding rather than twisting became the norm. Slowly, the older patrons were pushed to the fringes as the college students initiated an almost orgiastic tone. The group played without flagging as they fed off the energy of the crowd, but you could hear the frustration in their pleas that the crowd try to dance without breaking any of their equipment. At one point, Fontes punctuated the saccharin lines of “My Girl” by begging the front-row crowd to make space while a young man in garish suspenders thrust his hips suggestively at an older woman. The third set became even rowdier, but about halfway through, most of the audience dispersed and only around 20 dancers remained. There was a sudden calm during the last numbers—“How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You” ended with Fontes addressing the last stragglers: “Congratulations, you’re the group that didn’t get thrown out.” After an encore of “Shout” for a crowd of 15, the bar cleared out.
The band tolerates even the rowdiest crowd, and it seems to be an integral part of their larger mission of preserving soul music and a successful fulfillment of their more practical goal of making sure everyone enjoys themselves. “We provide entertainment so people can have a good time and dance and enjoy this music that stood the test of time,” Rosco says. “That’s what we really do.”
This combination of soulful ambition and day-job commitment keeps each show at the Cantab fresh and meaningful for both the band and the audience of regulars. There’s an embracing tolerance in Valadez’s gleeful, rapid-tongued emcee monologue: “This is another damn Thursday.” Somehow, he uses the same voice even when he asks the crowd to be careful not to break Fontes’s foot.
THE SOUL SURVIVORS
“Maybe the drunk college kid crowd tweaks the show a little bit, but even that’s genuine,” Berthiaume says. “That timelessness that’s in the music is in that scene.”
Though the music may be timeless, many acts devoted to the same genres resort to gimmicks to make it feel authentic, a paradoxical strategy. The Chicken Slacks have some of the typical aspects of a traditional cover band—the nicknames, the hype man—but their sheer skill and overwhelming commitment to the Cantab make genuine the crowd’s experience of their act. Their shows are fueled by tenacious showmanship verging on willful ignorance of their ever-varied surroundings, and a throbbing energy that feeds on the rowdiness of the crowd the band tries both to tame and entertain. All of the members treat their work in The Chicken Slacks like a job but maintain a belief in the music that transcends their routine.
Soul music, even in its original form, has mostly been played by cover bands. Many soul and Motown greats would cover each others’ songs, which in turn were often written by songwriting teams. With the exception of singer-songwriters like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, soul and Motown music has always been sung by thrown voices; snatches of melody and refrain that come out of the dancehalls, into the mind of a songwriter, and back into the dancehalls and bars through the voice of a singer. So when Valadez talks about “putting a little Chicken Slacks into it,” he and his band are essentially doing the same thing with their arrangements that the ‘original’ artists did. Only they are working decades later and most frequently in a bar where high-definition is something that comes with a channel in the 800s rather than off a vinyl cut from more wax.
Each member of the band thinks of soul music as an ideal genre for different reasons. Berthiaume sees soul as spiritually consistent with its gospel roots: “Originally this music was singing and dancing for God, and then Ray Charles just kind of switched that a little bit and instead of ‘This Little Light of Mine’ it became ‘This Little Girl of Mine,’” Berthiaume says.
For Rosco, The Chicken Slacks are a means of preserving the music of his youth. “It’s music that I grew up with, I listened to it as far back as I can remember,” Rosco says. “More recently with The Chicken Slacks I’ve been able to go back and revisit the material that I grew up playing and I hear new things in it, and I hear more authentic bass lines, so I’m enjoying it a second time around as well.”
Valadez talks about his work with The Chicken Slacks through the lens of his training as an expressive arts therapist. “I knew the power of healing in music. It does have that power to heal the individual or at least set them in the right direction when used properly,” Valadez says. For him, the music loses some of that power on record, and only in a live setting can it really move a person physically and spiritually.
Fontes sees the same value in the music. “I think when you sing soul, you’re talking about things people have in common. I think it can be therapeutic for a lot of people,” Fontes says just before the show. “The songs I like singing the most are the ones that talk to people where they live their feelings.” Even when he has to keep the crowd back, he can remember why he plays the weekly concert: “That anticipation and excitement builds in me every week.”
“That gig can become a slog,” remembers Berthiaume. “You gotta love it to do it…but I love that place—it’s the best place in the world. There’s no bar I would rather be at.”
But eventually, the shows did wear on Berthiaume. “Once it stopped being fun I didn’t want to do it anymore. I wanted to leave before I got sick of it, before I got jaded. At the same time I was sweet on a girl,” he remembers. “I wanted to spend time with her. We wanted to go on an adventure.” Still, he occasionally comes back to see the group he began 11 years ago. “Sometimes I’m excited and feeling good and I’ll play a whole set, and sometimes I won’t even play because I love to sit back and watch the whole scene—I never got to do that for so long.”
I ask Berthiaume about what he thinks of what he sees from the back during the rowdy sets and the quieter nights. “I see joy,” he replies. “It’s joyful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 125 students currently under investigation by Harvard’s Administrative Board for their potential participation in the Congress cheating scandal—as well as other students who have recently gone before the Ad Board for academic dishonesty—are going through a process that is markedly different from the one they would have faced two years ago. For one, reforms made in 2010 have created new types of outcomes for students that include “local sanctions,” like requiring students to take advantage of tutoring, or penalizing them through grades.
However, an investigation by The Crimson that ran in four parts last week made it clear that the “reformed” Administrative Board is far from perfect. In fact, it is clear that the Ad Board must be both changed and re-conceptualized in order to become a fair and reasonable procedure.
Harvard frames the Administrative Board as an educational entity. It is possible to think of a way in which the University might be able to educate students who have faced the Administrative Board for reasons of academic dishonesty: for example, Syracuse University sends students to a “not-for-credit seminar designed to educate students about proper academic practices and the importance of trust between a student and teacher.” However, it is clear that Harvard’s Ad Board, as it is framed now, is far from an educational process. In reality, it is a penal institution, and it doesn't do anyone any favors to anyone by claiming to be anything else.
It seems clear that the Ad Board remains just as enigmatic and incomprehensible to students—both those who have never gone before that Board and those who have—as it was before the 2010 reforms. Confusion about the role of the Resident Dean, lack of student representation on the board, and lack of knowledgeable advisors can only contribute to a vision of the Ad Board as an immutably disciplinary process.
Students have the right to be tried with full knowledge about the Ad Board's policies and procedures. The Board must make greater efforts to respect the rights of the students who are effectively being tried under its process. For one, The Crimson found that students going through the Ad Board process generally don’t take advantage of the possibility of having an adviser—and even when they do, their advisers may not be well-informed about the process. The first and most straightforward change is to provide students going through the Ad Board process with a trained and knowledgeable advocate who can guide them through the process. It is clear that a students’ Resident Dean cannot be this person. In fact, Resident Deans must make clear to students that they themselves sit on the Ad Board and are not a confidential adviser.
Furthermore, like any true disciplinary process (like the US legal system), the Ad Board must adopt an accepted standard of evidence—“preponderance of the evidence” or “beyond reasonable doubt,” for example—instead of relying on the subjective and undefined “sufficiently persuaded” that the Board uses now. In addition, students who are under evaluation by the Ad Board should be able to hear any discussion that the members of the board have about them, as well as being able to respond in their own defense to the Board’s deliberations. These essential reforms would make the Ad Board function like a fair penal system—as it should be—instead of an unfair and elusive system that pretends to be educational but in actuality simply administers discipline.
The Ad Board process, as framed now, is much more like a trial than a not-for-credit seminar about plagiarism. It would behoove the University to acknowledge this, and to give the students who go before the Board for disciplinary reasons, be they academic or non-academic, the rights anyone should have under a disciplinary system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the election right around the corner, the presidential race is getting intense. Obama and Romney are neck and neck in the polls, my inbox is periodically inundated with emails asking for last minute donations, and I am beginning to fear that the election of Romney to the presidency is a real possibility.
There are so many unappealing things about the prospect of having Romney as president that it is nearly impossible to choose any one of them as the least appealing. However, there is one aspect of his campaign that has bothered me consistently both as something that I do not feel has been addressed widely enough, and something that I believe I have a slightly more personal understanding of than most. As a lifelong resident of Massachusetts, I cringe whenever he references one of his “achievements” as governor of Massachusetts. A large part of his campaigning has emphasized his success in creating jobs, improving education, and balancing the budget without raising taxes in Massachusetts, but unfortunately, much of what he says about his governorship is so skewed and misrepresented as to be no better than lies.
First of all, Romney did not really improve education in Massachusetts during his stint as governor. Massachusetts has always had a strong public education system, and although Romney did not make many cuts in school budgets or do much to negatively affect the already existing school system, he also did not do anything to actively improve the preexisting system. Furthermore, he threw his support wholeheartedly behind the Unz ballot initiative when he was running for governor, an initiative that, once passed, was actually a huge blow to education in the state. This initiative mandated that public schools in Massachusetts could not teach bilingual classes, which made learning and teaching much more difficult across the commonwealth. Furthermore, the dropout rate in the state doubled over the three years after the initiative passed, with a large percentage of the students dropping out being students who did not speak English as a first language, and thus a system that had worked well was scrapped for a system that was shaped by xenophobia.
Secondly, though it is true that Romney did not raise taxes as governor, he did cut state aid to many cities and towns, which resulted in those towns themselves raising property taxes on their residents. Thus, many working- and middle-class families did end up having to pay more taxes. Furthermore, rather than raising taxes even a small amount on the many upper-class residents of the state, he cut funding to many extremely important programs that disparately help working-class people, such as programs that provide aid to teen parents and provide aid to families living in poverty. As much as he tries to portray the changes that he made to the Massachusetts budget as solely positive, his policies negatively affected the poor. He also did not do as much for job creation as he claims. The job creation rate during his governorship was extremely low, only 0.9 percent (compare this to the national average of five percent), which meant that the job growth in Massachusetts ranked 49th in the country over the six years he was governor.
Furthermore, though Romney touts his time in Massachusetts as evidence of his commitment to bipartisanship, his record does not really support this claim. He issued over eight hundred vetoes during his time as governor, most of which were overturned by a Democratic Massachusetts House and Massachusetts Senate. The relationship that existed between him and the legislature was more of a struggle than a symbiotic relationship.
However, the one good thing that was actually accomplished under his governorship is the one thing that he seems to be strangely uncomfortable fully owning up to. The state-wide healthcare system passed under Romney did a lot of good for a lot of people, and was actually a model for the healthcare plan passed under Obama, commonly known as Obamacare.  Though Romney’s plan was nearly identical to Obama’s, Romney continually criticizes Obama’s system and gives a skewed account of the plan passed during his term. For instance, Romney brags that he did not have to raise taxes in order to finance the plan, but conveniently leaves out that the federal government provided funding for most of the plan.
I already had to live through four years of Romney, four years of bemoaning his inability to achieve his economic goals without affecting poor people, of seeing the terrible outcome of a xenophobic initiative that he supported unfolding around me in my school, and of seeing the repeated clashes between him and the legislature play out on the television. He was antithetical to nearly everything that I feel Massachusetts stands for, and if elected president, I am certain that he will be antithetical to all the good that this country is capable of as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those who follow elections often talk about the spoiler effect, which is when a third party candidate takes votes away from a major party candidate, resulting in a win for the opposition. Green Party candidate Jill Stein has put the 2012 Presidential election at risk of succumbing to the spoiler effect: If voters who would otherwise have cast votes for Obama instead vote for her, she might precipitate a Romney victory. So I appeal to anyone who cares about social justice, civil rights, or climate change to vote for Obama.
Many people I know are fed up with the electioneering of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Their influence of special interests and a refusal to give concrete details is more than frustrating. Instead, the people that I know are turning toward Jill Stein. Her main platform, the “Green New Deal,” is aimed at stopping climate change and getting our economy back on track.
I recently heard Stein speak at a rally, and her perspectives on why our political system is broken were enlightening and encouraging. It is good to know that there are people who are speaking out against the current inefficacy of American government. But while Stein’s commitment to mitigating global warming is admirable, a vote for Jill Stein is a wasted vote. She will not win this election.
The spoiler effect has jeopardized many significant elections in the past. The most prominent example is the 2000 President election, in which Green Party candidate Ralph Nadar received 94,000 votes in Florida, contributing to Democratic Party candidate Al Gore’s losing the election. Thus began an 8-year-long disaster under George W. Bush. I would count the Iraq War, civil rights abuses, a plummeting economy, and rampant climate change as all consequences of 94,000 votes that a third party candidate took from Al Gore.
The same thing happened in my home state of Maine. In our 2010 gubernatorial  election, a right-wing Republican, Paul LePage, won with only 38 percent of the popular vote. The Independent and Democratic candidates split the remaining votes, receiving 37 percent and 19 percent respectively. Now, generally liberal Maine has a Governor who has compared the IRS to the gestapo and has told the NAACP, “kiss my butt.”
As an environmentalist, I am not willing to risk anything on the chance that Romney might win this election. Like others, I have been disturbed by the pervasive “climate silence” in the presidential debates. For the first time since 1988, global warming—the most serious issue facing humanity today—was not mentioned during any of the debates. Obama mentioned the mythic “clean coal” and Romney called for more offshore oil drilling and fossil fuel infrastructure. On the whole, neither candidate has demonstrated a deep commitment to real discussion about climate change. Nonetheless, Obama is clearly more committed to halting climate change than his competitor. At the very least, he has broken the climate silence on MTV, and we cannot ignore the efforts that he has taken during his presidency to reduce America’s dependence on fossil fuels.
If the Romney and Ryan ticket wins, not only will climate change be pushed off of the agenda, but our civil rights will be jeopardized. These two men do not support same-sex marriage. Romney’s cavalier and objectionable attitude towards women, as evident by his “binders full of women” remark, will manifest itself in dangerous policies. Romney endorsed a GOP senator who said that “God intended” rapes that lead to pregnancies. During his time as Massachusetts governor, he vetoed a bill that would have provided emergency contraception to rape victims. If Americans elect a politician with these values, civil rights in our country will be doomed.
I acknowledge that our political system is broken and overrun with special interests. But there is a clear choice between President Obama and Governor Romney. I am too frightened for our future to sit by and hope that Jill Stein does not jeopardize an Obama victory. There is too much at stake. So, I will be voting for Barack Obama in next week’s election—and I hope that others who care about the environment and civil rights will too.

History is being rewritten. A game-changing court case involving Kenyan victims of the violence during British colonial rule is calling the history of the British colonial time into question.  Not only is the British government on trial for the atrocities committed in its colonial past in Kenya, but the case also opens the door for dozens of other potential cases against the British government from other parts of its former empire. Harvard professor of history Caroline M. Elkins played a key role in finding and organizing the evidence that helped the Kenyan claimants win their historic hearing at the High Court in London this past summer.
Nearly 60 years ago in colonial Kenya, the British placed thousands of Kikuyu people in detention camps to stop the Mau Mau insurgency, an anti-British rebel movement. The British colonial government tortured, maimed, or executed 90,000 Kenyans between 1952 and 1963. Three elderly Kenyans recently pressed charges against the British government for their treatment in these camps and won the right to a full trial, positioning them to get an official apology from the United Kingdom, as well as financial compensation.
For the case, Professor Elkins condensed her book “Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya” to 80 pages of archival evidence. In presenting these pages in the first ruling, the judge stated that there was enough evidence of systematized, British-inflicted violence for the trial to go forward. Her research team then began to distill the 300 boxes of files that the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office claims to have found in January of 2011—weeks before Elkins was to submit her first statement, she recalled.
“The 300 new boxes of files validate the claims I made in the first book,” Elkins recalled. “I then spent a year working with the Harvard students here on privileged access to 20,000 pages in the found files.” One of the most telling files, she said, explains the way in which documents were classified or destroyed. The “Watch and Legacy System” that the British had in Kenya divided files into two categories. “Watch” meant “destroy” or “return to London” (files that would embarrass the government). “Legacy” files were those that the British deemed of historic value—what they wanted their perceived legacy to be.
Elkins described her job during the hearing this past July as “minute-to-minute” advising on the case. “It is high pressure for a historian to be told to put together these documents on a daily basis to counter the British government in court.”
Now that the case may be settled, the claimants feel as though they are getting some form of justice for their suffering. Until this trial, Elkins said, victims were silenced, even though “the British government was sitting on the evidence that would show they are telling the truth.”
“One of the reasons the British government has fought this case is that it is a precedent-setting one,” Elkins explained. The recent ruling that time limitations didn’t apply for this case opens the door for cases against the British government in other former colonies. “There is a very accepted narrative that the British government was very successful and fought wars with minimal bloodshed. That is not the case,” she said.
But the case has implications for more than just the British colonial legacy. “It is very unusual that our work as historians has such real-time impact on individuals, the subjects that we are writing on, really shifting the way in which the world thinks about something,” Elkins reflected.  She noted that Bush-era policy on counter-insurgency appears to be based on British policy in the colony of Malaya, which had also set the precedent for Kenya. “It wasn’t about minimum force. It was about using systemized violence to promote the civilizing mission,” she said, adding that we can see similar patterns emerging in Iraq and Afghanistan, and potentially in Iran and Syria.
Although currently on sabbatical working on her next book, Elkins anticipates that the course she teaches on British colonial violence will be greatly changed based on the new evidence presented in this trial. “Empiricism is the lifeblood of history, but what do we do when the evidence is gone? How do we piece it back together?”  She indicated that this intellectual conundrum will be integrated into the course. “There is never a semester that goes by whereby I don’t learn new things myself. I am looking forward to that generative learning process because in terms of my own work as a researcher, writer, and teacher, it doesn’t get any better than this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last time Harvard canceled classes during the blizzard of 1978, John E. Knoebel Jr. ’79 and his football teammates spent the day helping elderly Cambridge residents through six or seven-foot snow drifts.
“In the river houses, you could actually jump out of the second floor window,” Knoebel said. “That’s how high the snow was.”
Knoebel said that even after heavy snowfall that February, he and his classmates were still surprised that classes were canceled. “You never expected that to happen,” Knoebel said. The previous year, then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III said that Harvard would shut down “only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”
Now, 34 years later, Harvard closed its doors for Monday’s classes in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy.
Egyptology professor Peter Der Manuelian ’81, who was a freshman in 1978, said he was “a little surprised” that classes were canceled Monday but thinks the administration acted appropriately.
Manuelian said he remembers that the cancellation of classes when he was a student was a cause for excitement rather than fear. “At first it was a bit of a party atmosphere,” he said, although the College also provided a safe place to be during a storm, he added.
This time around, students and Cambridge residents say they were enjoying the thrill of the rare meteorological event—and the rare day off it allowed.
Cambridge resident Michael Kirsch described his day as “quite pleasant,” adding that he only “got flipped around once by the breezes.”
Brandon Arcilla, a Cambridge resident who originally hails from Texas, said that he was unimpressed by the storm’s severity.
“Honestly, this is absolutely nothing,” Arcilla said. “We got hit by Rita and Katrina. This is a walk in the park.”
Maria Huinh, a tourist visiting from Texas, said she was unfazed by the storm, and described walking around Harvard Yard as “an adventure.”
Connor B. Hinebaugh ’15, who was throwing a frisbee with a group of other students in the Quad Monday afternoon, said that their intramural game scheduled for Monday evening had been canceled.
That did not stop his team from playing anyway, in weather that Hinebaugh described as “not too bad.”
“We’ve had worse frisbee weather,” Hinebaugh said. “We’re not making many catches, but we’re still having fun.”
While some people ventured outside during the storm, most decided to stick with indoor activities. Jordan T. Weiers ’16 said that when he and his friends heard that classes were canceled, they threw open their dorm room window, blasted Whitney Houston’s “How Will I Know,” and later watched the movie, “The Help.”
“Other than that, I haven’t really done that much,” he added.
Anthropology professor Theodore C. Bestor and his wife prepared for Hurricane Sandy by collecting emergency supplies.
“It looks like it’s gonna be a storm that’s larger than anything that’s hit this part of the world for a while, so better safe than sorry,” Bestor said.
In an email, Professor Homi K. Bhabha wrote that the storm gave him a chance to catch up on his writing.
Bhabha wrote he also had planned a dinner party for Monday evening that would include “a dark and delicious braise of beef, pearl onions, spices and red-wine.”
When asked whether he thought canceling classes was disruptive, Bhabha said “not at all” and thought the administration’s actions were “absolutely appropriate, particularly for those who don’t live nearby.”
Government professor Daniel Carpenter wrote in an email that he found the day depressing, in part because of the inclement weather, but also because he watched his “beloved Tigers get swept by the Giants last night” in the World Series.
But Carpenter said the day off gave him a chance to spend time with his family.
“My children are home from school today, and so I got to play with them,” Carpenter said. “But then both of them humiliated me in Wii.”

With gusts topping more than 60 miles per hour, Hurricane Sandy brought down branches, power lines, and several midterms. For the first time in 34 years, Harvard University suspended classes due to inclement weather on Monday.
Though professors were not required to come to campus, the University continued its “core operations”—including normal dining and shuttle services for undergraduates—requiring dining hall workers, shuttle drivers, and facilities workers to report for duty despite the storm.
Donald Ford, a facility maintenance operations employee working in the Yard Monday afternoon, said he and his co-workers were “basically waiting for something to happen.”
The dining hall restrictions in Adams and Quincy and the upperclassmen restriction at Annenberg were suspended. Alison Farley, the general manager of the Cabot and Pforzheimer House dining halls, said she saw more students than usual in the dining halls.
“It’s been pretty busy. All the kids are here, so we’ve been working to make sure they’re well-fed,” Farley said.
Chad Campo, chef and production manager of Leverett House, said that all Leverett dining hall workers except one had been able to make it into work. The MBTA closed its operations at 2 p.m. on Monday, allowing workers to use the transportation to commute to work.
“We already determined carpool scenarios,” said Campo.
The University worked in coordination with Harvard University Dining Services to determine the best way to help staff during the emergency, according to an email from Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
HUDS also offered to put workers up in hotels if they would not be able to travel home, Neal wrote in the email.
Students showed their appreciation of dining hall workers by holding standing ovations in several campus dining halls Monday night.
As a result of Monday’s canceled classes, many courses also pushed back midterms and papers.
Kyle T. H. Flattery ’15 was supposed to have two midterms, one for Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology 10: “Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology” and the other for Chemistry 17: “Principles of Organic Chemistry,” on Monday.
The University announced its decision to cancel classes around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, and by 11:00 p.m., both midterms had been rescheduled for later this week.
After hearing his tests had been postponed, Flattery decided to turn Hurricane Sandy’s arrival into a “sleeping-in day.”
“It’s strange to be so happy about a natural disaster,” Flattery said.
Despite excitement from students, United States and the World 31: “American Society and Public Policy” professor Theda Skocpol said she was concerned about moving the course’s midterm because she believed her students were prepared for the midterm.
“All the students in our class have been doing the work all along. They just get more anxious,” Skocpol said.
Ethical Reasoning 33: “Medical Ethics and History” professor David S. Jones ’92 chose to postpone a paper originally due on Monday.
“I got an email from a student wondering if we were having it due today. It got me thinking whether it’s worth it or not,” Jones said.
Jones said he reasoned that, had he asked papers to be due in lecture instead of by electronic submission, the deadline would have had to be postponed.
He said he believed the decision to postpone the paper was appropriate following the University’s decision to shut down.
Jones said papers could be turned in before the new Tuesday deadline, but as of 3:15 p.m. on Monday, only 35 out of 215 have been submitted, according to Jones.
Professors were generally not concerned about how to make up material from the canceled lectures. Jones said he will incorporate Monday’s lecture into the week’s section.
“I don’t anticipate that the loss of one lecture day will be highly problematic,” wrote Chemistry 30: “Organic Chemistry” professor Andrew G. Myers, whose course also had a midterm scheduled for Monday.
According to Harvard’s website, the University plans to resume normal operations Tuesday.

With Hurricane Sandy bearing down on Massachusetts and Election Day one week away, Senator Scott Brown called for a temporary calming of the state’s political storm on Monday, when he announced that he would not participate in the final Massachusetts Senatorial debate. It was scheduled to take place Tuesday night in Boston.
“It is simply not appropriate to go forward with a political debate when a disaster strikes,” Brown’s communication director Colin Reed said in a statement Monday afternoon. “The focus for all of us before, during and after the storm needs to be on emergency response and disaster relief, not campaigns and politics.”
Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren had already canceled their campaign events on Monday when Brown announced that he was withdrawing from the debate.
Brown’s announcement surprised debate organizers, who had planned to wait until 10 a.m. Tuesday morning to make a decision whether or not to cancel. The debate was sponsored by a consortium of Boston media outlets and was to be moderated by CNN’s John King.
Tuesday’s debate was expected to be the last of four between the candidates. Regina Daley, media relations manager for debate host WGBH, said that the consortium is working to reschedule the debate later this week, but ultimately the decision to debate will be up to the campaigns.
As Brown stepped off the campaign trail and into disaster relief mode, political experts said he may end up benefiting politically from the storm and its aftermath.
According to former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, natural disasters like Sandy often benefit elected officials who can respond competently and capture the public’s attention and respect.
“I think that there’s a certain aura that surrounds any person in public life who is rising to the occasion,” DiCara said. “I think if Scott Brown is out there, it helps him out.”
President Barack Obama, a Democrat, is likely to get a similar boost, according to DiCara. He said this could potentially aid fellow Democrat Warren’s campaign, offsetting the Republican Senator’s gains among Massachusetts voters.
“He’s going to wear that barn jacket, he’s going to go around in his truck, and he’s going to make his points, and there’s not much a challenger can do,” he added.
Todd Domke, a Republican strategist, said that Warren will look bad if she tries too hard to publicize her reactions to the storm, and to get involved in relief efforts.
“The challenger has to remain a bystander because if they [get too involved] it just looks like they are trying to politicize it,” Domke said.
Warren’s campaign said Monday that she would not debate in light of the storm and will follow the guidance of Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 until the storm had passed.
“Today the focus should be on safety. Elizabeth is asking everyone to heed the Governor’s warning to stay home if they can, and stay off the roads,” Warren spokesperson Alethea Harney said in a statement. “Elizabeth has canceled all public campaign events. She has closed all our field offices for the day and urges everyone to take necessary precautions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 27, 2013, at 1:19 p.m.
With concentrations, secondary fields, and language citations, a Harvard undergraduate’s schedule can fill up quickly. For some students, the added challenge of filling pre-med requirements while concentrating in a non-science field has spread them across even more disciplines.
Balancing Diderot and dissections, these students are everywhere academically—running from the Barker Center to Northwest Labs. Even though they might be left with fewer electives during their four years, they see two sides to their undergraduate education, unlike some of their peers who are only in the humanities or the sciences.
“You don’t fit completely into either,” says Ghassan S. Gammoh ’14, a pre-med undergraduate who is concentrating in history and literature. “You exist in this middle path, which has been hard to navigate, but I find that it’s a really good experience.”
According to Oona B. Ceder, director of premedical and health career advising at the Office of Career Services, medical school acceptance rates between non-science and science concentrators are about the same.
“The most important thing is that there is evidence in the students’ coursework and research that they chose their concentration and courses because they were interested and passionate in those areas of inquiry,” said Ceder.
Below are the stories of three students who say the combination of their concentrations—history and literature, social anthropology, and history—and pre-med requirements have given them a unique view on their futures in medicine.
‘A BIGGER VISION’
Gammoh pulled clean, latex gloves taut against his fingers before reaching for the scalpel. For Gammoh, whose older sister and parents are all doctors, this procedure would not be difficult.
A few hours after incising, Gammoh had completed his lab for the week. He had successfully dissected a cat.
“It wasn’t fun necessarily for a lot of people, but I found it exciting,” Gammoh says.
Gammoh, who will be finishing his pre-med requirements this year, is a history and literature concentrator who plans on heading to medical school directly after he graduates.
“I wouldn’t say that I knew from when I was a small little kid, like a lot of other people,” he says. “But I knew that I wanted to help people.”
But while Gammoh knew he wanted to be pre-med before even matriculating at Harvard, he did not know what concentration he wanted to pursue until sophomore year. Instead of pursuing a science track, however, he decided to look at non-science concentrations.
“I eventually found that by doing hist and lit, I could include a lot of my interests in politics and political movements and immigration, for example, while also being able to read such great literary works and look at such great works of art,” Gammoh says.
Gammoh, who is an international student from Saudi Arabia, says that taking history and literature courses helped him stay connected to the Middle East. Still, his background might lead to some difficulties in his path to medical school.
“My dream is to end up in a medical school in the United States, and it’s different for international students—it’s tougher,” Gammoh says. “That’s always something that’s in my mind. I don’t let it dampen my hopes, but it’s something I have to consider.”
But for now, Gammoh says being an undergraduate at the College hasn’t restricted him at all. “Being at Harvard, I have the opportunity to gain such a global perspective of my world,” he says. “Hist and lit...really helps me keep a bigger vision towards the world.”
‘I AM WHO I AM’
When Annemarie “Annie” E. Ryu ’13 tripped over a curb and fell right on her face a few days before a major midterm, she picked herself up and proceeded directly to late night office hours instead of University Health Services.
When her face was swollen and she could no longer move it, she finally went to UHS later that night—after much convincing. Ryu, who was preparing for a midterm for a pre-med course, chalks up her adamancy to a common trait among most pre-meds: drive.
“I think medicine attracts a particular type of person, like any career does,” she says. “One type of person it attracts is someone who’s very driven to create positive change in the world.”
Ryu is a social anthropology concentrator with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy. She’s also the founder of Global Village Fruits, a business that imports jackfruit from India to the United States.
“I’ve always been someone who has diverse interests, so having some hard science classes and some social sciences classes as well as Gen Eds is a great mix,” Ryu says. “If I had taken a bio concentration, I would have a stronger understanding of a lot of aspects of biology, but I wouldn’t have such a changed worldview. And I wouldn’t give that up for anything.”
Ryu, who co-leads another startup that sends text message reminders for appointments at a rural health clinic to new and expectant moms, says that being a pre-med, non-science concentrator does not pose any unexpected difficulties.
“Everything that I do is something that aligns with who I see myself as now and in the future,” Ryu says. “It is one integrated mission and vision, and I don’t separate aspects that are pre-med and aspects that aren’t.”
“I am who I am, and I think it just happens that I would really like to go into medicine, and that I’ll be able to make the change I want to see in the world if I get an M.D. and practice as a doctor,” Ryu says.
AN ‘UNEXPECTED HUMANITARIAN COMPONENT’
In his spare time, Anton Y. Khodakov ’14 broadcasts Men’s Hockey Team games and classical music for WHRB, Harvard’s radio broadcast channel, and is an active member of the undergraduate history journal Tempus: The Harvard College History Review. He prefers humanities readings over textbooks on genetics—which is why he chose to concentrate in history despite being pre-med.
“It’s never been an academic component to the decision. I don’t really care for the biology aspect of the classes I’ve taken here so far,” Khodakov says, referring specifically to Harvard’s biology offerings. “There’s nothing interesting to share about being an academic pre-med. It’s the track of medicine—the stuff that I’ve seen with my eyes that doctors do.”
Khodakov says that in terms of the difficulty of the coursework, he does not recognize any difference between his pre-med and non-pre-med courses. The only difference he has noticed about being a pre-med, non-science concentrator is that getting a secondary field is harder to achieve.
“If you focus on it and you plan pretty early on that you know you’re pre-med, then it’s really not that difficult, and you get exposed to non-overlapping academic circles and therefore, by extension, social circles,” Khodakov says. ”I’ve never found either environments to be particularly stressful or competitive.”
While Khodakov says that the academic component of being pre-med has not interested him much, he knew that he wanted to pursue medicine by the fall semester of his freshman year. His interest in medicine has always stemmed from the appeal of patient interactions and hospital work.
“This person is in pain or sick or scared,” Khodakov says. “Not only are you running this test, it’s your job to do it. You have to be doing everything right, and there’s the scientific component to it, but there’s also the pretty immediate and kind of unexpected humanitarian component.”
“That’s what attracts me to pre-med—it’s really an intense and emotionally affecting environment to be in,” Khodakov adds. “You don’t get that from everything you have to do to get to med school and beyond med school.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, the children of John M. Johansen ’39 were constantly engaged by a creative pioneer who continued to push the boundaries of innovation. Their father, a modernist architect known for being a member of the “Harvard Five,” brought his work home to help them create elaborate sand sculptures on their trips to the beach.
Johansen died Friday of heart failure in Brewster, Mass. He was the last living member of the “Harvard Five,” a group of modernist architects affiliated with the Graduate School of Design, of which Johansen was also a graduate. Among his creations are Mummers Theater in Oklahoma City, and the Plastic Tent House in Stanfordville, N.Y., which he made his home. Johansen was 96.
But for his children, he was a creative genius in another right. He brought kitchenware, along with beach balls and rubber tubes, on family trips to the beach, his daughter Deborah Harris said, helping his children carefully sculpt abstract pieces in the damp sand. He taught them to value a keen sense of artistic experimentation in everyday activities.
His son Christen said that they used to go to junkyards, looking for silverware to use in sculptures or stainless steel turnings for jewelry.
“I would really see him as a renaissance dad,” Harris said. “He composed and played music beautifully on the piano, he has a book of limericks coming out. He had a beautiful voice and sang.”
“He was an extraordinary draftsperson in drawing and painting. And he wrote a somewhat philosophical book,” she added. “He was very caught up in the creative spirit.”
Johansen also taught at several universities, including Yale, and, according to Christen, loved teaching. “He would ask questions [of his students], and through these question get them to explore and to go deeper into their reasoning for why they’re doing things,” Christen said.
Johansen also treated his children like adults, Christen said, exposing them to artists early on. “They were not introduced as famous people,” he said. “They were introduced as ‘We’re going to see my friend who has this huge shop where he cuts metal and puts it together in all different, wonderful ways.’”
Johansen will be most remembered for his profound commitment to the modernist movement. Even the title of his autobiographical book, “John M. Johansen: A Life in the Continuum of Modern Architecture,” testifies not only to his inventiveness, but also to his perseverance as a pioneer, according to his daughter.
In particular, she remembers that he would frequently repeat to her the phrase “sempre avanti,” which in Italian means “always forward.” It would later define his work as an architectural pioneer who persisted against the odds.
“I say that he is very courageous because his architecture was not in favor for a couple of decades, but he just kept on,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 threw open the door to his home and was nearly thrown backward by a gust of wind.
“Good job, you made it. Welcome!” he said, holding the door open for a group of students who had braved the hurricane to attend Monday afternoon’s “First-year EqualiTea,” an event the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life co-sponsored. Cups of hot tea, cucumber sandwiches, and pastries were waiting for guests on the table in the living room. A few minutes past 4 p.m., there were at least 30 students and faculty members at the event.
“I was surprised that so many people showed up despite the weather,” said Joseph J. Vitti ’10, a proctor who specializes in BGLTQ issues. “The rain couldn’t stop us.”
Vitti and his partner Clark S. Goodwin planned the event together and said they were not willing to call it off just because of Hurricane Sandy. While Vitti spearheaded the Queer Movie Night and National Coming Out Day events for freshmen earlier this month, Goodwin had been working on hosting a tea since the beginning of the year.
“It was happening. There was no option,” he said.
Vitti, who earlier in the day sent an email announcing that the event would still go on, addressed guests with a short welcome speech. He then handed Dingman the flag that freshmen had signed in support of BGLTQ students on National Coming Out Day. The flag will be hung in the Freshman Dean’s Office.
“I am delighted that Joe and Clark had this idea and that people were happy and warm,” Dingman said. “I would have been crushed if people didn’t come.”
Though Dingman has previously hosted open houses for freshmen at his home, this was the first BGLTQ-specific event he has hosted.
“We wanted the community to know that our home is open to all students. Everyone is welcome at the table,” he said.
Goodwin and Vitti said that the name of the event­, “EqualiTea,” was created by Mike C. Ross ’16, a student in their entryway. Though the tea was specifically geared towards BGLTQ students, they wanted to make the event as inclusive as possible.
“Mike told us we should call it the ‘EqualiTea’ and we jumped on the idea,” Vitti said.
When asked how they got to the event, students jokingly said that they had been blown over to Dingman’s house and called the walk an “adventure.” Tai Boon Ding ’15 had leaves stuck on his cheek when he arrived.
“It was really bare on the way over here. There was no one on the streets,” Ellen L. Shrock ’16 said. “But I’m glad I made it. It’s such a conversation-starter to meet people at an event like this.”
Goodwin added that he felt the event was a good way to expose freshmen to the BGLTQ community at Harvard.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to go to events like these at my college, but they’re everywhere here,” he said. “The community is fantastic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department arrested a 17-year-old female and escorted her out of the Lowell House dining hall at 8:29 pm on Sunday night.
According to the HUPD log, officers were dispatched to respond to reported disturbances the woman was causing. When the responding officer ran her information, he found that she had an active no trespass warning for all Harvard University property.
The woman was arrested for violating the no trespass warning she had previously received from HUPD. A representative from HUPD could not be reached for comment on Monday evening.
The woman returned to the House on Monday afternoon, when she was escorted out by Lowell Building Manager Robert Sammonds, according to an email Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck sent to the House community. In her email, Eck wrote that the woman was also suspected of a theft and had previously been issued trespass warnings at Gund Hall, Weld Hall, and Leverett House.
On Sunday, the woman spoke with students in the Lowell dining hall and asked them for contact information for a Harvard undergraduate.
Lowell resident and Crimson arts exec Leanna B. Ehrlich ’14 interacted with the woman in the Lowell dining hall. According to Ehrlich, the woman asked her to look up the contact information of a Lowell sophomore, and to use her phone to call him.
Ehrlich said that she initially cooperated with the woman because she assumed that the woman was a student or a new dining hall employee.
In Eck’s email to Lowell residents, the House Master informed students of the incidents and cautioned them to be vigilant about whom they allow into University buildings and dorms.
Eck quoted Lowell Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03 to encourage students to be proactive in protecting “our urban campus.”
“I don’t think she’s a threat to our students but, as always, be aware. Stay safe today,” Eck wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Is this really what the Mayans were so worried about?  We were expecting something more along the lines of death and destruction, but we’re cool with this no class thing.
By now you’ve probably heard of that nice young lady named Sandy. She made history on Sunday night when she caused classes to be cancelled, resulting in a near-stampede in Lamont. She even shut down schools and public transportation from here to Washington, D.C.
Needless to say, Sandy is currently the most popular girl on the East Coast. She’s triggered a storm of tweets, including some from Harvard’s athletes.  Here are a few to fill up all that extra time.
1) Harvard erupted in joy when Dean Hammonds cancelled class on Sunday. Most people reacted like junior defensive end Austin Taylor:
“SUNDAY FUNDAY ‪#Sandy”
Cancelling classes is impressive, but turning Sunday into a Funday is downright impossible. Sandy should definitely put that accomplishment on her resume.
2) It appears that Sandy hasn’t won everybody’s hearts. TJ Laurish, a freshman on the baseball team, couldn’t believe that his practice didn’t get cancelled.
“Lift is still on at 7:00 with this hurricane? You got to be kidding me.”
Harvard baseball goes hard, TJ.  Didn’t you see the Call Me Maybe Video?
3) TJ’s teammate, sophomore outfielder Mike Martin, didn’t know what to say about the new girl on the block.
“I was going to make a hurricane joke but I couldn't think of one that didn't blow. Monday classes cancelled! ‪#hoorah”
Speaking of jokes, do you think the Columbia football team is laughing right now while they do a rain dance in hopes that they don’t play Harvard on Saturday? Because this is probably how Sandy makes them feel.
4) Junior attackman Danny Eipp has a question for meteorologists:
“If it's supposed to rain horizontally tomorrow we wont get wet, right? ‪#wishfulthinking”
Sure, Danny, and it’s also cloudy with a chance of meatballs.  Here’s our question for Dean Hammonds, who, like every other meteorologist in the Boston area, might have been a little hasty with her weather predictions: since the precedent has been set to cancel classes when it rains, does this mean that whenever it pours we won’t have school?
Those are your tweets of the week. As Sandy tears through the Eastern seaboard, she is leaving a huge mark on Twitter, too. Clearly she is an “Act of God.”

When sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri won the final point to claim the singles A-draw championship for the Harvard men’s tennis team, the feeling must have been familiar. After all, only a few hours earlier, he had taken home another first-place trophy in doubles.
The two tournament victories concluded a weekend full of personal bests for Chaudhuri at the Harvard Halloween Classic. In three days, the sophomore won eight matches, lost none, and did not drop a single set.
“Every match went my way, and I was able to pull out the matches in tight situations,” Chaudhuri said. “I don’t think I’ve won four singles and four doubles in the same weekend in a while, so it was a pretty good weekend overall.”
Seeded No. 2 in the singles draw, Chaudhuri decisively defeated every one of his opponents, winning each set by a score of 6-2 or 6-4. Chaudhuri paired up with sophomore Henry Steer in the doubles draw, and the team emerged victorious with its closest match ending in an 8-5 score.
The weekend marked Chaudhuri’s only two collegiate tournament wins.
“I thought Shaun played very well,” sophomore teammate Denis Nguyen said. “If you win either the singles or the doubles, it means you had a very good weekend. I’m proud of him for playing out the weekend with a winning record.”
Chaudhuri quickly advanced through the first two rounds of the singles draw to set up a semifinal match with Harvard sophomore Alex Steinroeder. Both opponents were very familiar with each other—in addition to being teammates, Chaudhuri and Steinroeder are also roommates.
“It’s always tough to play one of your teammates, especially since one of them is also your roommate,” Chaudhuri said. “But it’s a situation which any coach would love, having all four semifinalists be from Harvard. It’s bittersweet that we’re all doing so well but in the end only one of us can pull through.”
After defeating Steinroeder, Chaudhuri faced off against freshman Kelvin Lam, who had just captured a back-and-forth win against Crimson co-captain and top-seeded Andy Nguyen.
Chaudhuri jumped out to an early lead and took the first set against Lam. Although Lam managed to break serve against Chaudhuri early in the second set, the sophomore bounced right back and broke Lam twice to secure a 6-2, 6-4 victory.
Harvard dominated its competition in the singles A draw.
The four Crimson players who reached the semifinals were the only Harvard representatives in the bracket, and they only dropped a total of one set on their collective path to the semifinals.
“It was a great weekend for our team in general,” Chaudhuri said. “A couple players were returning from injuries, and it was a good tournament for everyone to get back and see where they are since the start of the season. The fall season is good practice for the spring, so it was a great tournament to shake out the cobwebs.”
The tournament marked the first time this year Chaudhuri and Steer have played as a doubles pair. The duo clicked from the start and defeated opponents from MIT, Amherst, and Army to win the title Sunday morning.
Prior to this weekend, Chaudhuri had posted a 2-2 record in singles on the year. Both of his losses came in three sets in tournaments in Napa Valley, Calif., and New Haven, Conn.
Chaudhuri was also successful in his freshman campaign. Last year, Chaudhuri earned 30 wins, the most of any Harvard player, and posted a sparkling 23-3 record in dual match play.
“[Last year] went pretty well for everyone on the team, and we trained really hard,” Chaudhuri said. “So I think the momentum kind of carried through the summer and into the fall season. This weekend was really a culmination of all the hard work we put in last year and the start of this year.”
The Crimson will participate in its final fall tournament at the Tribe Invite, which begins on Nov. 9 in Williamsburg, Va. Chaudhuri and the rest of the team say their goal is to finish the fall season on a positive note before winter training begins.
“I think everyone just wants to focus on each match and just getting more practice and getting stronger every match,” Chaudhuri said. “[The Tribe Invite] will be a good way to end our fall season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s action proved bittersweet for the Harvard sailing team.
The co-ed team traveled to Brown University, where it qualified for the Atlantic Coast Championship with an eighth-place finish in the Schell Trophy.  But the women’s team could not replicate that success, finishing 10th at Connecticut College’s Victorian Coffee Urn.
Despite its low finish, the women’s team had reason to celebrate when junior Caitlin Watson skippered Harvard’s B Division boat to first-place finishes in the first and third races of the regatta. It was the first time Watson had finished first as a skipper in her college career.
“[This weekend’s performance] is something that [Watson] is really proud of, and we applaud her for that,” said freshman Kristina Jakobson, who participated in the first race of her college career at the Victorian Coffee Urn as crew for the B Division boat.
The co-ed team is preparing for ACCs in two weeks at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in New York.
“The competition will be pretty difficult,” Crimson coach Mike O’Connor said. “We sailed a regatta there earlier this season, so it’s good that we are acclimated, and we are looking forward to it.”
The team says it is excited about the production it is getting from its younger members, especially freshman walk-ons
“We are pretty dependent upon walk-ons, and there are several of them that are doing a great job,” O’Connor said. “Sydney Karnovsky has done a tremendous job crewing for Andrew Mollerus. They have been working really hard and improving every day.”
SCHELL TROPHY
Harvard edged the University of Vermont by one point to take eighth place in the eighteen-team regatta.  The Crimson barely squeezed into ACCs, as only the top eight finishers qualify for the postseason. Yale ran away with first place, beating out second place Brown by 31 points.
“We were able to overcome a few obstacles, including an OCS—a premature start—in the second-to-last race,” O’Connor said. “We are a young team and we are up against some very difficult competition, and the fact that we were able to qualify for the ACCs bodes well for us.”
Sophomore Gram Slattery served as skipper for A Division, and juniors Alma Lafler and Ben Lamont split time as crew. They finished seventh overall with 97 points, including a second-place finish in the fourth race.
In B Division, Mollerus raced with Karnovsky, junior Luke O’Connor, and sophomore Brian Drumm. They earned 119 point for 12th place, including six single-digit finishes.
“We are a work in progress but we achieved our goals qualifying for ACCs,” O’Connor said. “It means that we will have a good chance of qualifying for nationals in the spring.”
VICTORIAN COFFEE URN
The women’s team struggled with consistency and conditions in its 10th place finish. Dartmouth took first in both divisions, beating second-place Yale by 45 points.
“We had some really variable conditions, which made it difficult,” Jakobson said. “We had really light and shifting winds on Saturday, and on Sunday we had a lot of heavy wind and puffs.”
In Division A, junior skipper Morgan Russom and junior crew Isabel Ruane came in 13th overall with 104 points. Despite starting slow with two consecutive 15th-place finishes, the team improved throughout regatta and ended the weekend with a second-place finish.
“There are things we could have done better and will continue to work on,” O’Connor said. “A lot of it has to do with execution out of the starting line, and some of it has to do with our heavier boat handling.”
The Crimson’s Division B boat fared better, placing sixth overall. Watson joined junior Jacquelyn Cooley and Jakobson in this division.  The racers earned five single-digit finishes, including two in first place.
“We are disappointed that we didn’t qualify this weekend, but we worked hard and had some really good races, and we are proud of those,” Jakobson said.
Nevertheless, the women’s team is looking forward to the season’s remaining and watching the co-ed team compete in ACCs.
“It’s a shame we didn’t qualify, but we are really psyched that the coed team did,” Jakobson said. “We are looking forward to lots of training and working hard to get ready for the spring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team will have to wait a little longer to try and snap their current two-game losing streak.
The Crimson (2-9-3, 0-4-1 Ivy) was set to face off with Holy Cross (5-8-2, 2-2-2 Patriot League) on Tuesday, but the onset of Hurricane Sandy caused the game to be postponed to a date to be determined.
This will be the last non-conference game for Harvard, which currently sits in seventh place in the Ivy League with two conference games to play.
Against Holy Cross, the team is looking to come out strong in the first half and avoiding taking tie games into overtime.
This season the Crimson has gone into overtime seven times and won only once, on Oct. 16 against BU.
In a season of close games—Harvard has only lost by more than one goal twice—the Crimson players say they seek to prove that the results have not reflected the talent on the team.
Led by a balanced offense, the Crimson has been shut out only four times in fourteen games.
Senior Zack Wolfenzon and freshmen Oliver White and Jake Freeman sit atop the Harvard leaderboard with three goals apiece.
The three are tied for seventh place for goals in the Ivy League.
The Crimson is averaging 0.9 goals per game, but it has not been enough to rack up wins. They have been outscored 26-12 despite strong efforts from freshmen goalkeepers Evan Mendez and Joe Festa, who each boast .714 save percentages.
The Crusaders enter the game on a two-game winning streak, led by forward Josh Cintas, who has scored six goals this season. Kevin O’Connell has also been dangerous in front of the net, with four assists and one goal on the year so far.
The two teams did not face each other last season, but Harvard has won the matchup in the previous three years.

There's never a dull moment reading through the Flyby Tip Box submissions. From entries that really should have remained between the curious searcher and his/her own hand (see Sept. 10) to unsolicited statements about movies and food stuffs (see Oct. 6 and Oct. 16), the mistaken searches and comments submitted through the Tip Box are always a riot to read, if not one of my finest daily pleasures.

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet). 
You would be immediately censured as shallow if you judged people based on their looks. But when it comes to food, looks matter. Prettier food just tastes better.
One such restaurant that focuses on the quality of presentation as well as the taste is Chez Henri, which offers a dynamic fusion of French and Cuban cuisine. Since it opened its doors in 1994, Chez Henri has received wide acclaim in the culinary world, having won several Best of Boston awards like "Best French Restaurant," "Best First Date Restaurant," and "Best Fusion."
Upon entering the restaurant, my dining partner and I were greeted by a hostess who seated us at a candle-lit table. Other than the dim lighting that made it hard for me to read the menu, the ambiance radiated warmth and comfort.
We were munching on slices of French bread when the waiter brought our entrees. Despite my aversion to cheese, I decided to get the Seared Ricotta & Semolina Dumplings ($24) because I was craving the chewy texture of dough. What surprised me the most about the dish was its stunning presentation. About a cup of gnocchi in the shape of mini marshmallows was placed on the center of a white rectangular plate over a purplish red puree of roasted beet and carrot. A sautéed medley of glazed broccoli, cauliflowers, summer squash, and carrots was served on the side to satisfy one of my daily servings of vegetables. The lightly seared ricotta sprinkled on top added light crispiness to the doughy dumplings.
My friend's entrée, Pan Roasted Long Island Duck Breast ($28), didn’t disappoint either. On top of the rhubarb ginger gastrique, or caramelized sugar sauce deglazed with vinegar, laid pre-cut slices of medium rare duck breast that were juicy without being too tough. A bed of citrus salad on the side with poached pear offered a little crunch from the arugula, while the mashed sweet potato found a perfect medium in texture between runny and coarse.
The presentation of food matters, but the food at Chez Henri would have tasted great even if I had been blindfolded.
Located on Shepard Street near the Quad, Chez Henri is open for dinner seven days a week and for Sunday brunch.

The Crimson has taken presidential election polls  since at least 1884, when James Blaine beat out Grover Cleveland by just  20 votes among Harvard men. Harvard picked Alfred Landon and Wendell  Wilkie over FDR in the 1936 and 1940 polls. At Harvard, Dewey really did  defeat Truman, by a margin of more than 2:1.
Now it's your turn to be a part of history.
Click here to vote in The Crimson's 2012 presidential election poll.  We'll find out whether Law School students or Grad School of Design  students like Obama more, whether science or humanities concentrators  are more likely to pick Romney, and how many Harvard students want to  legalize medical marijuana in Massachusetts.
Please cast your ballots by 5 p.m. on Wednesday so  that we can analyze the results and announce them before Election Day.  You need not be a registered voter to participate.
Contact managingeditor@thecrimson.com with any questions. Happy voting!

Some people distract themselves from heavy workloads by taking a walk, others de-stress by eating, while still others spend hours looking up cute pictures of animals on the internet. Winthrop tutor Wendi X. Zhang is now making it easier for everyone to procrastinate with a new tumblr dedicated to her beloved corgis, Fizzy and Chief.
Last November Zhang was studying for an exam and decided to take a break by browsing around Craigslist to see if anyone needed someone to walk their corgi. What she found instead was a listing from a family who needed to give their corgi up for adoption. That's when Wendi got her first dog, Chief.
"My boyfriend used to complain, 'You send me pictures and videos of corgis all the time; you should just get one,'" said Zhang. "I made the call on a Wednesday and picked [Chief] up on Sunday." She got her second corgi, Fizzy, this August from a family in San Francisco. "I adopted Fizzy because I could tell Chief was a little lonely," she said.
The two dogs are now the focus of Zhang's new tumblr, which she updates with pictures and videos almost every day. The site has been up for over a week, though Zhang has been curating pictures and videos for a while to share with the families from whom she originally adopted the dogs. Fizzy, six months, is the smaller of the pair, while Chief is six years old. In addition to documenting their lives on the internet, Zhang also takes her corgis on walks around Harvard Yard, along the Charles, or over to MIT. In addition to checking out this adorable duo on the internet, students also have the opportunity sign-up to walk Fizzy and Chief throughout the week.
