After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The insurrection on January 6 has once again brought to light the deeply disturbing and urgent problems that the United States faces today and has been facing for nearly its entire history. The events not only threatened democracy in an unprecedented fashion but also resulted in the loss of five human lives, proof enough of the horrifying and saddening nature of the insurrection. Among the dead is U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. He died after being struck in the head by a fire extinguisher at the hands of a member of the livid mob — a demonstration of the descent into lawlessness that happened at the Capitol.
That day, as I first saw the rally galvanized by President Donald Trump, my initial impression was that nothing significant would happen. Surely they’ll just march peacefully towards the Capitol and that’ll be it? I mean, this is the United States — the archetype of how a democracy should work. What else could happen? So I decided to carry on with my day, and in the evening, I would finally see the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.
When I later saw how the mostly white male protesters broke windows, vandalized senators’ offices, and brandished neo-Nazi and white-supremacist flags, I was utterly shocked. This cannot be the U.S. How could it be? A part of me knew there was no denying it — this was really happening. Yet another part balked at accepting the truth.
Growing up in Venezuela, I constantly encountered ideas such as “The American Dream.” I looked up to the United States as the example of how a country should function. Whenever my country’s situation worsened, many people around me would migrate to the U.S., searching for better opportunities — sometimes not even better opportunities, just any opportunity. What I saw on January 6 made me question all these beliefs. What is “America,” really?
From an early age, I was taught that America is a whole continent — South America and North America. We rarely ever made the distinction between the North and the South. To me, I was already American. Everyone I knew was American. I was growing up in America — until I learned the English language, the distinction made between North and South America, and how “Americans” are citizens of the United States. Of course, I knew I wasn’t a U.S. citizen — but now I wasn’t even American. What, then, is America?
This is a question that I frankly do not believe I am in the position to answer. However, we can draw meaningful and enlightening lessons from the differing definitions of America I grew up with. The combined American continent is the second largest continent in the world, housing six megacities, and nearly 1 billion inhabitants. It is an extremely diverse continent, with several climates, cultures, ethnicities, and religions. And I submit that this is a crucial part of what America (the country) is.
The United States is a country built upon diversity — diversity of cultures, diversity of views, diversity of identities, diversity of people. It is a country where immigration has played a vital role in its economy and politics. And through all of this, the ideals of democracy and freedom have been pivotal. Thinking of “what” America is, therefore, necessarily entails thinking about a rich blend of cultures, languages, and ideologies; it entails thinking about a population that is only growing ever more diverse.
But it also entails thinking about a long, long history of injustices and inequalities, among which are the events of Wednesday, January 6. On that day, I, along with millions of other viewers worldwide, watched the maliciousness with which the insurrectionists invaded the Capitol, the inaction on the part of the police, the insolence and disrespect towards democracy on display, and the overall hate that the invaders emanated as they bellowed slurs and threats. I was shaken by it, I was frightened by it. What if I had been nearby? What would these people have done to me? Even though I was only looking through a glass screen, the hatred and animosity still penetrated me.
Nevertheless, I choose not to feel discouraged. I choose to think back to the differing definitions I had about America and how, in the end, they’re really the same: both a melting pot of cultures, ideals, identities, and people. But I also choose not to ignore the significance of the storming of the Capitol. Rather, I use these events as a reminder that there is still an immense amount of work left to do in the areas of equality, justice, and democracy — in the U.S. and worldwide.
When we face trying times like this, the stage is set for immense growth and improvement, for we are forced to rethink important matters in society and in the world overall. Thus, let us utilize this time to find places for discussion. To think deeply about America’s history, America’s grand diversity, and America’s injustices. Do not let the significance of these events pass; the actions we all take today will be crucial in the development of a better America and a better world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Center for Advanced Biological Innovation and Manufacturing has obtained $76 million in funding and signed a lease for a 40,000-square foot site in Watertown, Mass. for the manufacturing and innovation of new biotechnologies, it announced in a press release Thursday.
A public-private partnership led by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, CABIM was formed in late 2019 to foster partnerships between academics, biopharma, and medical leaders to accelerate the production and delivery of new treatment technologies to patients.
Harvard led the fundraising effort, along with other founding members of CABIM — including MIT, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, Cytiva, and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., which owns and operates the business park where the center will be located, called The Arsenal on the Charles.
Other investors include several Harvard-affiliated medical institutions — Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital — as well as MilliporeSigma, a biotech company.
The initial funding will support building efforts, a staff of 40 full-time employees, and daily operations, according to the release.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in the press release that a collaborative effort to find innovative ways to treat diseases has significant benefits during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“At a time when we face a devastating global pandemic, collaboration between the greatest innovators in the life science community has never felt more important or had more to contribute to knowledge and human health,” Garber said.
He added that the Center will tap into “the region’s life science ecosystem and intellectual capital to discover new approaches to prevent and treat illness.”
Bottlenecks in biomanufacturing often result in delays of up to 18 months for new therapies in clinical trial stages, according to the press release. The Center’s mission is to accelerate this process by combining research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization in the same space.
The Center’s research and development will focus on cell and gene therapy, gene editing, immunotherapy, and biotechnology, including CAR-T cell therapy, which modifies the body’s T cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells. These types of immunotherapies “offer the potential to treat or even cure” diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s, according to the press release.
CABIM plans to include eight cleanrooms in the manufacturing facility and to adhere to “good manufacturing practices,” according to the release. Notably, the Center will also produce both cell and viral vector products.
Vice Provost for Research Richard McCullough wrote in an emailed statement that the Center will include cross-industry collaborative spaces.
“This facility will house academic, hospital and biopharmaceutical organizations – all committed to working together in advancing high-risk, high-cost pursuits with the potential for high patient impact,” McCullough wrote. “The center will be highly adaptable to ever-changing technology, and a unique platform for talent development in a rapidly growing field, where there is a widely acknowledged critical need for a workforce with specialized skills.”
CABIM will decide on an official name for the Center and its leadership team in the upcoming months. The Center plans to begin operation in 2022.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
L. Tracee Whitley ’88 will serve as Harvard Law School’s new dean for administration, the school announced Wednesday.
The dean for administration oversees the Law School’s administrative affairs — including facilities, faculty support services, finance, human resources, and information technology.
Whitley will report directly to the Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82, aiding with “short and long-term financial and operational plans” and working alongside the University’s central administration, according to a press release.
She said in the press release that she is “incredibly proud and pleased” to take on the new role.
“The opportunity to serve faculty, students and staff at Harvard Law School is the culmination of both my educational and professional experiences in the Harvard University and Greater Boston communities, and of my business operations experience in the global legal industry,” Whitley said.
She added that she looks forward to “learning about the Harvard Law School community and to working every day to support the teaching, research and service that makes HLS the unparalleled leader in legal education.”
Whitley will take over from Matt Gruber, who will become chief financial officer and chief operating officer at private equity firm Sagamore Capital Management.
Gruber has worked at the Law School for six years, serving as dean for administration for three of them. In recent months, he served on the search committee for Harvard's next police chief and helped pilot a University-wide remote work system for staff that aimed to deter the spread of Covid-19.
Whitley previously served as the chief operating officer of law firms Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP and Bingham McCutchen LLP. She also served as an associate lawyer at Boston firms Steffensen Herman & Doggett LLC and Robinson & Cole LLP.
Manning praised Whitley’s leadership experience in the release.
“I am delighted to announce that Tracee Whitley has agreed to serve as our new dean for administration,” Manning said. “Tracee’s proven success as a leader, as an innovator, and as a creative and thoughtful administrator, combined with her deep ties to Harvard and her extensive legal background, make her the ideal candidate to oversee the School’s administration.”
“[Whitley’s] collegiality, creativity, and institutional acumen will make her a superb administrative dean,” Manning said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following narrow victories for Raphael G. Warnock and T. Jonathan “Jon” Ossoff in the runoff elections for Georgia’s Senate seats, Harvard students met the news of a Democratic-controlled Senate with a mix of elation, regret, and tempered anticipation.
Ossoff defeated former Sen. David A. Perdue Jr. (R-Ga.) by 1.2 points, while Warnock defeated Sen. Kelly L. Loeffler (R-Ga.) by about two points. With these victories, Democrats will hold a narrow majority in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris as the tiebreaker in the 50-50 split.
Several Harvard students spent the day celebrating the Senate results, with many in states of disbelief. Anna L. Duffy ’21, who worked as a Democratic field organizer in Georgia, said she spent the runoff day celebrating on a call with other campaigners for the Georgia Democrats.
M. Kate H. Travis ’22, who worked as a field organizer for several Democratic candidates in 2020, said she was “shocked and ecstatic” at the results.
“Before the election, I didn’t want to give myself the chance to hope for this because I didn’t want to have to deal with a major letdown again,” she said.
J. Alexander White III ’23, who served as a delegate for Virginia in the 2020 Democratic National Convention, said his peers were “excited and cautiously optimistic across the board” about the results.
“I rode to work that day listening to ‘Georgia on my Mind’ by Ray Charles,” he added.
Kimani E. Panthier ’24 said he thought the Democrats had a “pretty solid chance” of taking the Senate back in November when no candidate reached the 50 percent threshold required for an outright win. The day of the runoffs, he said he stayed up until 2 a.m. watching the news all day. Knowing that Warnock will become the first Black man to represent Georgia in the Senate gives him “immense joy,” he said, calling the pathbreaking moment “monumental.”
Though Democrats will control the executive and legislative branches, some students called for renewed bipartisan cooperation. Amen H. Gashaw ’24, vice president of Harvard Undergraduates for Bipartisan Solutions, said leaders should prioritize compassion and cooperation across the aisle.
“We've seen a lot of vilification of the right at large, and I don’t think that a lot of that denigration of conservatism to be fully in good conscience,” Gashaw said. “There’s room for both sides on campus and beyond to just grow in understanding and empathy and do their best to adopt the perspectives of their opponents.”
Kyle A. Englander ’23, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said that he “admittedly was unhappy” with the Georgia results. He said he hopes, however, that both elected officials and Harvard students will “lower the animus,” especially following the riots in Washington, D.C. last week.
“Moving forward, putting a premium on the character of our leaders is going to be really important,” he said. “There is rebuilding that needs to be done.”
Some students said they are doubtful that Congress will pass certain progressive policies they have pushed for, even with both chambers of Congress and the presidency controlled by the Democrats.
“People will have to evaluate whether they believe in the Democrats’ ability to deliver the change that they’ve promised, versus what I predict will be a relative inaction on the part of the Biden administration,” said Benjamin B. Roberts ’23, treasurer for Harvard Young Democratic Socialists of America.
Travis said she is hopeful for meaningful progressive change both in legislation and political culture.
“I’m excited to see a turnback to a respect for democratic norms and people considering progressive policies not just as a thought experiment, but as a real possibility for this country,” Travis said.
