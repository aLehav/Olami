If you’ve ever seen a Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production, you’ve likely seen Jonah C. Priour ’09 on stage. The actor, whose contributions to Harvard theater recently won him the Jonathan Levy Award, has performed in almost all of the venues on campus, as well as major shows such as “Children of Eden” and “The Hyacinth Macaw.”Remarking on the sheer number of productions he has starred in, Priour says, “I’d say there are about two big letters of apology that I have to send to my TFs every semester.”Performing on stage has always been one of Priour’s passions. “I was raised in a very small town in Texas, and around those parts I was known as the thespian guy,” he says. When Priour heard that about 10 to 20 student-run theater productions are shown every semester at Harvard, he began to seriously consider attending the college. While still a high school student, Priour saw a play for the first time at Harvard, an experience which proved to be surprising. “It was in the basement of Adams and there were two theater lights, and I was sitting next to pipes that were running, and there was traffic right outside the windows,” he says, referencing a production held in the Adams House Pool Theatre.“This was my representation of Harvard theater. But I thought that as long as there were people creating and doing what they love, then that was all I wanted.”At Harvard, Priour has been involved in an enormous variety of venues, from small-scale productions to those held on the Loeb Mainstage. “I’ve had the honor or the luck to fall upon most of the spaces in Harvard, probably mostly because I did way too many shows most semesters,” he says.“I’ve been in the Radcliffe Sunken Garden, which is like this little patch of grass, and the difference between that and the Mainstage, which is right across the street, is huge,” he explains. “But it’s interesting because you see a lot of the same people in the same places, and I really get the feeling here that there’s this sort of vibe that’s like, ‘Let’s take a space and make the best artistic project that we can out of it.’”For Priour, stage work is about a collective experience rather than the individual performance. Describing his feelings following a typical performance, Priour says, “I’ve learned that in the face of not having the greatest performance on stage, it’s still the idea of stepping into this alternate reality with the stage as this communal appreciation for the human struggle that we all go through in one way or another, [which is] incredibly exciting.”Priour’s performances at Harvard have extended beyond theater space. Over the course of the past four years, he has starred in nine student films, the experience of which initially required him to step out of his comfort zone. “I’ve always been sort of terrified of having this camera in the room, because it means you have to have the perfect performance that take,” he explains.But rather than restrict his acting experience, Priour has embraced the new challenges posed by film work. “I figured I might as well get used to it now when it’s in college and it’s a safe atmosphere, so I started going to these auditions. And little by little I got bigger parts in bigger projects, like thesis projects,” Priour says, “and that has been awesome because it’s a totally different world.”While he does not yet know where his acting career will take him, Priour remains confident that acting will play an integral role in his life, referencing a Disney quote about his plans after graduation: “High diddly dee, the actor’s life for me.” —Staff writer Bram A.

With a mother who teaches costume design and a former set designer for a father, Sarah A. Sherman ‘09 was probably always fated to be involved with the theater in some way. As one of this year’s recipients of the Jonathan Levy Award, which recognizes “the most promising actor or actress at the University,” it’s clear that her genetic predisposition for the stage paid off. Growing up in New York City, Sherman would spend long hours after school with her mother in the costume shop. When she started high school at St. Ann’s in Brooklyn, she began taking acting classes and performing in shows. When she got to Harvard, though, Sherman decided not to participate in the theater scene. She opted out of Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s Common Casting and spent her time with classes and adjusting to a new school. Worried about the shows’ intensive rehearsal schedules, Sherman says, “I didn’t think I’d have the time.” She spent her freshman and sophomore years exploring other extracurriculars and interests, but she always felt that something was missing. Despite the great friends she had made, she says, “The search for the passion thing had been getting me down.” It wasn’t until her junior fall that Sherman decided she would give acting a chance. She auditioned for Common Casting and was given the role of Jackie in “The Art Room,” a romantic comedy set inside of a mental hospital. “It’s a funny play, but it’s also poignant,” Sherman says of her first Harvard production. Playing Jackie, a “particularly deranged woman,” was a struggle, but the experience was a rewarding one for Sherman. She finally felt that she had found her niche at Harvard. Her directors for the show, Julia L. Renaud ’09 and Renee Pastel ’09, were two of the reasons she felt so excited to be involved again. “If they hadn’t been these phenomenal women and phenomenal directors, I don’t know,” Sherman says, “I think things would have probably been different.” After “The Art Room,” Sherman went on to have roles in “The Vagina Monologues,” “Cloud 9,” and “Henry V.” Her favorite role, though, was as Dora in HRDC’s 2008 Visiting Directors Project, “The Hyacinth Macaw.” Though a linguistically difficult role, Sherman counts it as her favorite production. “It was emotionally challenging for me,” she says, “and more than anything Marcus Stern is a totally incredible director.”Sherman describes her time in Harvard theater as “hugely, hugely” influential on her overall college experience. “It’s been a really important creative outlet and a space where it’s work and I take it really seriously, but it’s also a break.” A History major, the stage provided a welcome interruption from thick textbooks and the dusty stacks. Most of all, though, theater was a chance to do something she really enjoyed. Though her parents occasionally worried about how much time she was spending on the stage rather than on homework, to Sherman, her time on the stage was definitely not a waste. “I would argue that that time is incredibly important to holistic well being, which is something that Harvard students forget about.”—Staff writer April Van Buren can be reached at amvan@fas.harvard.edu.

Ceramics is normally a field dominated by women,” notes David J. Tischfield ’09. “I get known as the pottery guy.” A Neurobiology concentrator in Leverett House, Tischfield is one of two winners of the Louise Donovan Award, which is presented to those who have been influential behind the scenes in the arts at Harvard College. Tischfield has produced the “Clay All Night” pottery event for the last three years, teaches four classes every year in the Ceramics Program’s satellite-studio in Quincy House, and frequently exhibits his own work on and off campus.David’s interest in ceramics began early, and he cites his high school ceramics teacher and a pottery-enthusiast neighbor as his greatest influences. “I lived in my neighbor’s pottery studio and threw on the wheel obsessively,” David says. When he was 16 he worked as an assistant in his high school ceramics studio: “My teacher really tried to foster my growth as a ceramics artist.” His neighbor, a dentist by trade, taught him not only the fundamentals of pot-making but the science behind firing kilns, making glazes, and forming clay bodies—skills seldom taught in typical classes but that are essential to the art of ceramics. David also picked up rare methods, like raku, a Japanese technique where the clay is baked in an outdoor bonfire instead of a traditional kiln so that it acquires a metallic, earthy sheen. Finding similarly passionate potters was more difficult upon arriving at Harvard. “There are no other undergrads quite as involved as I am,” he says, “but I hope to change that.” He fosters undergraduate excitement about ceramics by producing “Clay All Night,” an all-night biannual event where he teaches students to use the pottery wheel and model clay. He has also demonstrated pot-making techniques for archeology classes and has shown his own work at art shows around campus and in Boston art galleries.Surprisingly, his love of ceramics has played into his chosen field of neurobiology: “You need an artistic eye to do a lot of the science, because so much of what you see under the microscope needs to be transferred clearly onto paper.”  But there is also a practical, physical element. “My hand skills have developed,” he says. “I have become extremely good at doing surgeries and other lab techniques, like putting really thin brain sections onto slides and injecting embryonic cells with needles that are 50 microns wide.”For Tischfield, ceramics have also facilitated forays into entrepreneurship and community service. Besides teaching volunteer workshops for SPARK, an after school program in Boston for inner-city youth, he works on “La Casas de Experanza,” a micro-enterprise project aimed at helping develop the slums of La Prusia, near Grenada, Nicaragua, by giving them the means to support themselves in an independent, sustainable way. “I’m researching environmentally conscious kiln options and developing a business model,” he says. “As of now, it’s basically 200 families living in shacks of tin and wood on the side of dirt paths, but that is beginning to change.”Upon graduation, Tischfield is going to continue to run the Ceramics Program’s studio as a non-resident tutor in Quincy—after he spends the summer at what Tischfield calls “the Harvard of ceramics” in Jingdezhen, China. He has received a fellowship to study in Jingdezhen, a village of 325,000 craftsmen and artists built on the site of a 2000-year-old porcelain-producing factory famous for its tradition of flawless pottery.“Ceramics is something I’m always going to do,” Tischfield says. “I’m definitely going to have a kiln in my backyard. I can totally see myself doing what my neighbor did—being a 45-year-old doctor, coming home after work, lighting a cigar, turning on the radio, and throwing some awesome pots.”

Despite her high school involvement in theater, music, and dance, Catherine “Calla” Videt ’08-’09 entered Harvard with intentions of becoming a physicist. Now with a substantial list of acting and directing credits to her name, not to mention the first student show on the Loeb Mainstage in 15 years, it might seem as though Videt—the 2009 recipient of the Luis Sudler Prize in the Arts—has traded her passion for physics for a new one. But this is hardly the case. While she admits “I was just never cut out to make it as a physicist,” Videt has found a unique way to combine her seemingly irreconcilable interests in art and science. In order to help her test the boundaries between theater and physics, Videt designed a special concentration. She—advised by professors in both the English and physics department—is thus able to explore her fascination with expressing intellectual ideas through artistic means. “Harvard is a place where artists can flourish,” Videt says. “There might be this image that it’s not because there is no [dramatic arts] concentration, or that it’s all about the academics, but you can definitely pave your own way here.”Videt’s involvement with theater at Harvard began her freshman year when she was cast in four plays. She then moved behind the scenes, directing work in the New College Theatre, Loeb Mainstage, and the Loeb Experimental Theatre. Two of the shows she has directed were originally developed by the London theater company Complicite, including “Mnemonic” and “The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol.” Although she says her influences vary based on the project, Videt cites Complicite as one of her major sources of inspiration.  Videt—who spent her childhood in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore—believes that her experiences growing up contributed to shaping her artistry today. “Growing up in Asia helped me in terms of being able to explore a certain different type of aesthetic that exists in the world.”The young playwright’s studies, previous work, and diverse influences have culminated in “The Space Between,” a production which recently premiered on the Loeb Mainstage that she devised and directed. The experimental play—which Videt began working on three years ago—integrates theater, dance and physics. “I really find the live event of sharing a space and moment with a group of people to be extremely compelling,” Videt says. “It really can be a unique moment of exploration.”While she originally intended to present scientific concepts in a digestible form, the performance is far from a physics lecture. “I’m not looking to impose them [scientific theories] on people,” she says, “but I’m looking at them more as a way to affect people on a visceral level, in a non-cognitive, aesthetic manner.” Now, with graduation fast approaching Videt says that while her plans might not be concrete, her goal is to start a theater company. She expects to work with several other current and former Harvard students that she has collaborated with in the past. Though Videt hopes to continue developing “The Space Between,” the company will not necessarily be grounded in any sort of theme such as the link between theater and science. Instead she envisions it as more of an opportunity to explore a multitude of topics and further experiment with more non-conventional theater aspects such as multimedia. “We’re really open to anything,” she says.To Videt, theater will not be a job, but a way of life. “I want there to be no distinction between work and play and life, no nine to five lifestyle,” Videt says. “I want it to be all integrated.”—Staff writer Erika P. Pierson can be reached at epierson@fas.harvard.edu.

Amongst the cavalcade of colored sneakers and couture eyeglass frames, Sabrina Chou ’09 makes her presence felt with an effortless twist of red fabric. A Senior VES concentrator living in Quincy, Chou, known to some only as “bow girl,” is currently working on her thesis, entitled “Standard Operating Procedure.” The project explores the reductive nature of the process of production through art.  The centerpiece is an exhibit, opening this Thursday in the Sert Café, in which many “toolkits”—symbolizing the standard processes of production in areas from architecture to “toolkit-making”—are on display.  They are all stitched between two layers of muslin, however, so that they will never be used. Only the process remains.  The act of putting on her iconic bow every single day joins the ranks of these “standard procedures.” “It’s a subjective standard operating procedure, though, because I choose to apply it to myself.  It’s nice to have a uniform,” she says.Chou started wearing the homemade bow, which covers nearly one whole side of her head, a little over a year ago.  The bow is now a legend across campus, especially in Quincy dining hall, where it frequently appears like a glint of cartoon cheeriness peeking into the Harvard milieu; and Chou assures that it is a daily absolute.“I mean, you don’t leave your house without your pants, do you?  Besides, I think my head looks unbalanced without the bow,” she says.The bow may be the one element of constancy in an artist who is otherwise a paragon of interdisciplinary spirit and multifaceted interest.  Chou is interested in fashion; she did a fashion internship one summer in L.A, a good deal of her wardrobe is homemade, and she designs costumes for HRDC.  She takes photographs, plays keyboard in a band, is interested in architecture, and is a commercial graphic designer. Seen the Fogg Art Museum’s brochure?  It’s hers.She likes both creating and watching animations as well.  Her bow, in fact, was inspired by a character in a Miyazaki animated film named Kiki, a 13-year-old witch-in-training who flies away from home with her talking cat named Jiji and a large red bow.Indeed, she seems to have as many interests as she has bows on her bow shelf. This year she is taking classes to get her license for ham radio, a type of radio communications popular amongst hobbyists.  After graduation, she plans to work in a nanotechnology lab at UCLA.  “I really like tiny, tiny things,” she says, referencing an animation she made about a series of miniature worlds in jars and explaining the apparent discrepancy between cartoons and nanobots. The notion of impassable boundaries between disciplines seems to strike her as absurd, or at least misapplied.“I think with VES, especially here, you’re able to really learn a lot in other fields, and apply whatever you’re learning or reading or thinking about critically in your art,” she says.Because of this curious spirit, it seems that the meta-process of her artistic production is anything but a “standard operating procedure.”  Take, for example, her “Interactive, Hand-holding, Music-making Vest,” a vest that has buttons which can be pressed to make music, but only when the user holds hands with another vest-wearer.  She even varies the “subjective standard operating procedure” of her wardrobe. “For fancier occasions,” she says, “I’ll wear a bigger bow.”

During the week, Daniel P. Gurney ’09 learns theory and composition in the Harvard Music Department, where he recently composed a string quartet. On weekends, Gurney leaves the campus behind for Boston’s Irish pubs, where he plays jigs and reels on the accordion. “As far as the department is concerned, the accordion is my secret life,” he says.   While tradition is important to Gurney and his music, he is eager to push at its limits. Over the course of his time at Harvard, Gurney has brought together traditional folk music with other musical genres, such as Classical.  “Classical symphonies in class and Irish reels in pubs are much more related than I thought,” he says.   Gurney is a professional accordion player, with several national awards and a busking license to his name, but he first met the instrument in a toy store. “I was seven,” he says. “I tried on a toy accordion and just kept playing it until it broke. I’ve since moved on to bigger and bigger accordions.” His childhood also exposed him to Irish music, now a focus of his performance. In his small town in upstate New York lived an Irish priest who played the concertina, a mini-accordion. “He would have concerts every week with great Irish musicians. Afterward they would have jam sessions,” Gurney says. “It was a lucky way to get into the music.” Gurney, who describes his heritage as “half-Italian, half muddy European question mark,” has since done his best to access the roots of the music he plays. “I’ll always be a poser. But I grew up hanging out with old Irish guys. From that perspective I consider myself to be an Irish musician.”  When choosing colleges, “I knew I wanted to have an Irish scene nearby,” he says. After graduation, Gurney plans to live in Ireland to experience the land which informed the music he loves. “I want to learn how to help traditional music move forward without messing with what made it a tradition in the first place,” he says.  As a co-founder of the Harvard College American Music Association, Gurney has worked to give such traditional tunes a place in the school’s wide-ranging music scene. The Association’s aim is to expose Harvard students to traditional music. Last year, the association invited banjo player Béla Fleck, this year bassist Edgar Meyer. The club’s weekly jam sessions, as well as performances by Gurney’s own band, The Hay Brigade, have strengthened folk music’s presence at Harvard.  But while tradition plays an important role in Gurney’s music, he is not afraid to push at its boundaries.  “We are trying to show how different kinds of music have more in common than you might think,” Gurney says. “Bluegrass, jazz, country and Celtic—they can meet up and find some common ground.” And just as traditional music has expanded its reach among Harvard  students, Gurney himself has become a presence on campus. “I was in an elevator once and someone knew who I was because of my accordion playing,” he says. “It was weird.” —Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz can be reached at mschwart@fas.harvard.edu.

When asked if he has any regrets from his four years at Harvard, John D. Kapusta ’09 succinctly replies “I don’t think so,” an answer unsurprising to anyone familiar with his musical endeavors. During his time at the College, Kapusta has been integral to many musical organizations; his activities have ranged from playing the trumpet in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra to sitting on the board of the Dunster House Opera. A joint Music and Literature concentrator, Kapusta is also one of the few Harvard students participating in Harvard’s joint degree program with the New England Conservatory, which involves a full course of study at Harvard and an additional year at the NEC to complete a Masters degree. It was the freedom of the program, which entails weekly vocal lessons, that allowed Kapusta to pursue other musical interests in his extracurricular activities. “I had played the trumpet in high school and had gotten to play in all-county and all-state one-weekend orchestras, but never got to play in an orchestra regularly, so I wanted to do that here,” he says. “I knew I would be taking voice lessons anyway.” While Kapusta did not originally intend to study music academically at Harvard, he was surprised by how beneficial the endeavor has been. “I thought that Music 51 would be rehearsing old hat technical studies that I thought that I had already done, but the class was much, much more than that. It really did open my ears to listening to what is going on in music in new and different ways that I hadn’t thought about before.”The synthesis which Kapusta has experienced through his academic and extracurricular works is undeniable. He says studying music “affected how I approached the musical projects that I got to do on campus, enjoying doing new music of Harvard student composers, working with them, thinking about what exactly are we doing when we play a piece from the mid-nineteenth century or Mozart. What’s going on? Why do we enjoy it so much? What’s there?”Aside from the academic study of music, Kapusta has had many rewarding extracurricular highlights. He refers to conducting the Harvard Ballet company as “an artistic high” in its collaboration between student dancers and musicians. “It was extremely gratifying to see how two very fine artistic groups, artistic communities even, came together to present something jointly,” he says. Kapusta has few complaints about the arts at Harvard. While the youthful nature of the joint program with the NEC provides logistical challenges, Kapusta anticipates calendar reform and the maturing of the program will be able to remedy those issues. His only other “dream” for Harvard would be a performance space more suited to operatic performances. “Both [Harvard opera] companies perform in a dining hall,” he says, “which is part of their tradition, but in some ways is sort of limiting.” After graduation, Kapusta intends to take a year off before returning to the NEC to finish his Masters in music. He believes that the year, which he plans to spend studying music and French in Paris, will be a well-used break. “I’m still pretty young, and I’m not one of those singers with an extremely mature voice at this point,” he says. “It is really good to have the extra year to develop musically and intellectually as well as physically.” In discussing his long term goals, Kapusta has decided to pursue a career as a classical singer, but he would be open to any other opportunities that present themselves. “Whether the singing works out ultimately or not,” he says, “I want to have a career in music somehow.”—Staff writer Kerry A. Goodenow can be reached at goodenow@fas.harvard.edu.

During her time at Harvard, Allison B. Kline ’09 has been involved in over 20 dramatic productions, having the opportunity to produce, direct, act, sing, and build a 20-foot pool on stage. Between her theatrical obligations, she somehow managed to write her thesis for History of Science—on the history of dramatic acting techniques. This Kirkland senior seriously loves theater. Kline seems to have been surrounded by arts in some way throughout most of her life. She studied voice at the La Guardia High School for the Performing Arts but transferred after a year to a public high school. During this time, she got involved with theater, performing at both her school and her neighborhood YMCA. Once she began thinking about college, it was clear that Kline still wanted to be involved in theater, even if not through a conservatory. “I sort of considered other schools with more of a focus [on theater]. After deciding not to stay at La Guardia, I figured it would be better to go to a school where I could do anything that I wanted to but also be as involved in theater as I wanted to be. I wanted to leave my options open,” Kline says.	She immediately became involved with the dramatic arts at Harvard. Her freshman year she performed with, and was a board member of, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players, performed in the Dunster House Opera, and worked on light design in the Loeb Experimental Theater. From her start with musical theater, Kline moved to nearly every facet of dramatic arts possible. Her junior year she served as president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, and tried to be involved with nearly all of their productions in some form or another. Allison has produced two works during her time at Harvard. In 2007, she produced “Metamorphoses” and, in 2008, she produced “The Hyacinth Macaw.” Both productions were part of the Visiting Director’s Project, which provides Harvard undergraduates an opportunity to work with a professional director on a full-scale theatrical production. Considering whether she prefers directing and producing to acting, she says, “I think it depends a lot on the exact project and the situation. I really enjoy producing and directing when it is a project that I really feel strongly about. The different jobs can be rewarding in their own ways. I like doing each one much more having seen what the other side looks like.” Reflecting back on all of her experiences with theater at Harvard over the past four years, Kline says, “I think one of the most important things that the Harvard theater community has is it forces you to take a lot of initiative in whatever you do. It’s a challenge, but I think it’s that much more meaningful because everything is done so independently. You are always aware of how much work you put into it and you have to make everything your own. It helped me prove to my self how strongly I felt about theater and pursuing it regardless of the structure.”What does the future hold for Kline? Neither history nor science. “I will be doing something in theater. I think ideally I would love to be working someplace where it would be possible to do more than just one job, but I am pretty open to a lot of different roles as long as the community is exciting and doing interesting work.”—Staff writer Matt E. Sachs can be reached at msachs@fas.harvard.edu.

I’m gonna be a big deal,” jokes Alison H. Rich ’09. A veteran of the Harvard stage, she is preparing to take New York City by storm. “No,” she amends, “but I am going to move to New York and just start auditioning and see where all that takes me. I feel like I’ve wanted to be an actor for so long that I’m just over being afraid of it. I’m just going to do it and I’m going to make the world take me as an actor.”Throwing herself into the world of theater shouldn’t be a problem for Rich—it’s what she’s done since elementary school.“I decided to be an actor when I was 9, before I really knew anything about any of it,” she says. Since coming to Harvard, Rich has performed in 16 productions, playing characters such as Lillian LaFleur in “Nine,” Samuel Byck in “Assassins,” and April in “Company.” She has worked behind the scenes in several shows including “Alice and Wonderland” and “Bent,” but performing is both her passion and her priority.  “I’m kind of vain that way,” she quips. “No, I just love the experience of being on stage. It forces you to be in the moment in a way that you can’t duplicate in any other pursuits in life.”Rich is also the co-president of the Sunken Garden Children’s Theater, a group that performs for Cambridge children during Arts First weekend. “It’s really just fun and fulfilling and goofy and great,” she says. Performing to a younger set comes naturally for the charismatic and vivacious actress. “I like to do a lot of really over the top characters,” she says. “So I think children are my core audience.”Although Rich has been extremely successful in theater at Harvard, there was a time when she thought she’d rather study acting elsewhere. At the end of her freshman year, she applied and was accepted to NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, where she would have majored in theater. But at her parents’ urging, she remained at Harvard. “I think it actually would have killed me to go to a conservatory where everyone’s just being snotty and competitive and vapid,” she says. “The students here are really serious about theater, but they also have serious opinions on politics and all those other fields. It has made me a fuller person than I would have been. I guess the thing is, I don’t always know what’s best for myself.”Unlike Tisch, Harvard does not have a Drama concentration, but Rich has been able to pursue a special concentration in Dramatic Arts, in which she studies theater through the lens of literary analysis and psychology. As a culminating project, she has written a 75-page, 8-character play, which she describes as “really fun and farcical.”As Rich anticipates her future dramatic endeavors, there are certain aspects of the theater community here that she expects to miss sorely.“I take theater very seriously, but it’s also nice to do it in such a safe space,” she says. “Here, if I try to do a show and I bomb miserably, it doesn’t matter—there’s always another show.

In a theater circuit where everyone is about the same age, Barry A. Shafrin ’09 is often cast in younger roles—and it’s easy to see why: with boyish features, a slender build, and an open, charming smile, he exudes youth. But in the world of Harvard drama, Shafrin is anything but green.
During his tenure with Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, the 22-year-old has served as director, producer, dramaturg, and stage manager. Shafrin has played central parts in many shows over the years, notably in an acclaimed role as Tobias in last spring’s Loeb Mainstage play, “Sweeney Todd.” 
While his true calling is on the stage, Shafrin has proved capable behind the scenes. His sophomore year, Shafrin executive-produced a showing of “Bright Lights, Big City” that received national attention, and this past fall, he directed a production of “Nine” at the New College Theater. “Playing the role of director was definitely something very memorable and I’m really glad that I did it,” he says of mobilizing a 50-member crew in “Nine.” 
Shafrin has also been a leading man offstage. The senior has served on the boards of HRDC and City Step, and is currently co-president of the Sunken Garden Childrens’ Theater. SGCT is a 13-year-old Harvard troupe that performs free 20-minute shows from original scripts that are open to the public. Shafrin has been involved in the theater since freshman year and considers the project a therapeutic break from the daily grind. “It’s very low-key,” says Shafrin, “there’s a lot of people in Cambridge who come back every year and it’s a lot of fun.”
Though the Milwaukee native made an early entrée into the arts, when he arrived at Harvard, he hoped to explore the world outside of theater. Plans changed, however, after his first experience with the Freshman Arts Program—which caused Shafrin to instantly identify with the theater community.
Even though Shafrin continued on the theatrical path, the versatile actor has made a career at Harvard by broadening his boundaries, albeit in an unconventional way. His first professional voice training came only after landing a role in the Krokodiloes, Harvard’s premier all-male a cappella group. And Shafrin’s most recent stage role was also his drag debut. He played Juno, a pregnant, Sunny-D-swigging adolescent oracle, in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ burlesque, “Acropolis Now.” “I definitely felt like I didn’t know what I was doing,” he says. In spite of circumstances, the actor met with positive reviews.
Shafrin is quick to say that he hasn’t navigated the Harvard Drama circuit alone: his blockmates and close friends are also theater mainstays. And though he eschews discussing his own strengths onstage—opting to talk about himself as the product of an encouraging environment instead—his roommate and co-president of SGCT, Alison H. Rich ’09, points to a wealth of innate talent.
“I think what’s wonderful about Barry,” Rich says, “[is] he has a good sense of who he is as an artist, what he can bring to the table. “ 
Next year, Shafrin plans to move to New York City and embark on a new chapter in his theatrical career, and friends say the skills he demonstrates in Cambridge will be assets in the City. “I think Barry is really secure in his talents,” Rich says. “He’s extremely talented, and brings a very chill, fun, confident vibe to any show that he is involved in.”

Daniel R. Pecci ’09 is interested in what we think of as theater—and how he can expand the definition. The active member of Harvard theater began his creative exploration as a child, when he would orchestrate what he calls “haunted hayrides.” “We would create enormous spider webs, pyramids and pick-up trucks filled with hay,” he says. His play “Black-eyed Susanna,” written in his senior year of high school, won the Phyllis Anderson Prize for Playwriting in 2006 and was produced in Berlin the next year. “The play is about a mother and daughter on their wedding day, but it soon turns into a metaphysical poem.”Growing up near Cambridge, Pecci often saw theater performances at the American Repertory Theatre. The ART, he says, was “one of the reasons—if not ‘the’ reason—that I came to Harvard.”But when he arrived on campus, he found the school inhospitable to his love of theater. “I was told I wasn’t here to do plays,” he says. “I was really disappointed.” Pecci took the year off and founded an art gallery with friends.  Upon his return, Pecci fully immersed himself in the college’s theater scene as an actor, director, and playwright. When President Faust instituted the Task Force on the Arts in 2007, Pecci was asked to join as one of two College students. “It was a good way for me to express my dissatisfaction with the way things were operating here,” he says. Like Pecci, the members of the Task Force wanted art to be a “major part of the university, as opposed to being on the fringe.”Harvard, Pecci believes, has a duty as a wealthy institution to act as a patron for the arts. “It needs to fund that which is pushing boundaries and allow for artists to take risks,” he says. For Pecci, such risks are important to theater as it explores the intersections between play and performance. “What a script really is are instructions for an event—something to respond to,” he says. “It’s not about the story; it’s about the dramaturgy of what happened.” His own thesis—an original script for his play “O O O The Rodeo Show!”—plays on these ideas.“It is an allegory for America but also an actual rodeo show that takes 13 years to perform.” The script was so surreal, he says, that one of his thesis readers called it a novel rather than a play. “It has old men humping cars and flag burning, but also a Disney sensibility,” he says.  At the end of the play, he gives instructions to the audience to speak with one of the characters. “The only stage directions,” he says, “are to continue the conversation until the morning hours.”Such experimentation questions the definition of theater. “Theater can be a large-scale thing with hundreds of people watching but it can also be just two people talking,” he says. “With that, we’re getting into the kind of territory that’s exciting to me.”Though Pecci is not yet sure about what his future will hold, his zeal for theater shows no signs of flagging. He plans to continue working with his theater company, One Night Only, performing and devising more shows. Pecci further hopes to be able to remain in the Boston area. “I’d like to try to help my hometown become a theatrical destination,” he says.—Staff writer Madeleine M.

Senior theses are notorious for being time-consuming and frustrating, yet ultimately rewarding. Music concentrator Michael L. Schachter ’09 took this characterization to new heights with his thesis, an original composition spanning many genres and lasting nearly an hour.Schachter undoubtedly has the artistic chops to pull off such an ambitious undertaking. He started playing the piano at age five and began to improvise and compose shortly afterward. The Boston-area native soon became interested in performing jazz, and he took composition lessons at the New England Conservatory throughout high school. When college rolled around, Schachter chose a liberal arts education at Harvard over the conservatory experience: “I never really wanted to go to a conservatory because I thought I would be intellectually and socially stifled. The Harvard music department gave off good vibes, and the great compositional faculty attracted me here.” Since arriving at Harvard, Schachter has been a fixture on the university’s music scene. He plays piano and bass with both the Sunday and Monday Jazz Bands, has composed on commission for various ensembles, and has enjoyed the opportunity to perform alongside Herbie Hancock, Aaron Goldberg, and other jazz legends. Schacher credits Harvard Universiy Bands director Thomas G. Everett with getting him to “listen to good stuff” and for being his “de facto sugar daddy of the past few years” by arranging performance opportunities.  Schachter also used his time as an undergraduate to explore arenas beyond his musical comfort zone. Despite having no prior vocal experience, he joined the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum as a freshman and has sung with both the Collegium and the Chamber Singers—the Collegium’s Renaissance music subgroup—ever since. “My participation in the Collegium really informed my writing of music and made me think a lot more vocally and contrapuntally about the music I write,” Schachter says of his foray into vocal music.Schachter also plays bass with Kuumba, whose “raw energy and feeling have impacted [his] style of writing.” Schachter even picked up yet another instrument, the didgeridoo, when Kuumba went on tour performing aboriginal music in Australia.For his senior thesis, Schachter wanted to combine the free, improvisational character of jazz music with the elements of the classical compositional form he had honed during his undergraduate studies at Harvard. The product was “The Ten Plagues,” a ten-movement piece for small jazz ensemble based on the story of the Exodus. “My goal was to achieve a balance between making my piece sound free and to do what was necessary to make the work intellectually coherent,” reflected Schachter.“It was very artistically challenging. I personally have a lot of problems with the way that a lot of academics go about music writing: it’s so hyper-intellectualized and specialized that it’s very hard for the so-called uninitiated to appreciate it on an aesthetic level. I have a problem with people who make music ugly just to create a barrier to entry.”Schacter’s piece was performed last Monday in Paine Hall. The ensemble included members of the Harvard Jazz Collective as well as a few students and professionals from nearby conservatories, and they executed the piece in accordance with Schacter’s vision: “It was a very high energy performance and had much less of a performer-audience divide.”Schachter’s Harvard career has left a diverse and lasting imprint on the university’s music scene, but what’s next for this musical extraordinaire? “I’m resigned to eventually go to grad school,” Schachter piqued, “I am really into teaching, but I’m also interested in pursuing composition.” It seems as if grad school isn’t calling just yet though. Next year, Schachter will be long gone from Paine music building, splitting his time between India and Israel to study ethnic music.

Camera Obscura is an indie pop band. Camerata Obscura is what an indie pop band might have been like back in the Renaissance. “A lot of small playing groups call themselves camerata,” explains Anna H. de Bakker ’10, who sings the alto part in the vocal ensemble, “and we were making a pun.” The program that Camerata Obscura will be presenting on Saturday May 2 at 2:30 at Adolphus Busch Hall, titled “Music of Lament,” showcases music’s ancient past.Camerata Obscura is a small group composed of five singers that come together for Arts First. “We’re small—we’re one to a part,” says de Bakker. “Most choirs on campus there’s multiple people singing the same part, but each of us are just singing our own line. So it’s very small and it depends a lot on the individual singers.”The small size means that the group presents a different aesthetic feel from other choirs, due to the confluence of artistic vision from each member rather than one director. “You each have input into the things that you’re singing. You can react to each other a lot better when there’s so few of you,” says de Bakker.Another element that distinguishes Camerata Obscura and their repertoire for “Music of Lament” is that all the pieces were written in the period before the dawn of what we now know as classical music. “One of the things that characterizes early choral music is that they don’t get very much accompaniment,” says de Bakker. “You also get stylistic things like being polyphonic in texture. Each line is thought of as its own thing. If you’re just banging out chords on the piano it sounds sort of strange and you think, wow, this is kind of modern.”The program is tied together not only by the common time period of the pieces, but also by the theme of the works. “It’s all music that presents an emotion of sadness, but in very different ways,” explains de Bakker. “Madrigals are often about people who have died, or have left, and are stories. There all kind of variations on a theme—and they’re all really good music.”

“Copland is really one of the greats when it comes to American band music in the 21st century,” says Bilal A. Siddiqui ’11, one of the managers of the Harvard University Wind Ensemble. Tomorrow, the Wind Ensemble will perform “Old American Songs of Aaron Copland,” a showcase of songs from the corpus of this renowned American composer in celebration of Arts First. The performance, which will take place in Sanders Theatre, will include the piece “The Promise of Living” from Aaron Copland’s opera “The Tender Land,” as well as a selection from Copland’s “Old American Songs.” The latter will feature vocalist Davone J. Tines ’09 accompanying the ensemble. The performance will conclude with the march, “The Circus Band,” originally composed by Charles Ives.The inclusion of this last piece is meant to encompass the rich musical heritage of the U.S. by contrasting the works of two American composers, showing how each contributed to American Culture in their own way. Mark E. Olson, Assistant Director of Bands at Harvard and the conductor for this concert, explains that “[Copland’s] use of American folk music and jazz captured the ear of the average American,” whereas Charles Ives “was an innovator of rhythm and harmony, often using polyrhythms and cluster chords, a practice rather common today but unheard of at that time.” The contrasts between the two composers are representative of the multifaceted nature of American music.The focus on traditional American music gives listeners a rare opportunity to experience a performance by the Wind Ensemble unlike others in the past. Olson emphasizes the uniqueness of this concert, commenting that this arrangement of “Old American Songs” is relatively new and that “The Tender Land” opera is rarely performed. In addition, this is the first time that the group will feature a vocalist. With this Arts First performance, the Ensemble is attempting to  “reach out to the Cambridge community and expose people to what American music is really like,” according to Siddiqui, adding that “Copland is very representative of that.”

Amy J. Lien ’09 wants to challenge what she calls the commercialized image of textiles, a medium often associated with femininity and domestic life. In order to do so, she has organized an Arts First show featuring student artwork that uses textiles as a point of inspiration. “Latent/Lubricious (Fabrication Methods)” opens tonight in the Adams Art Space.Lien’s interpretation of textiles and fashion was influenced by critic Theodor Adorno’s views on pop culture as a means of producing commodities. Student artists including Anna J. Murphy ’12, Sabrina Chou ’09, Dana M. Kase ’11, and Amy M. Yoshitsu ’10 have contributed pieces to the exhibition.“I think the show started off as an exploration of textiles, not necessarily as a medium, but as a frame of mind,” Kase says. “And so the idea of textiles was our jumping off point. Then a lot of our conversation about what the cohesive element would be grew more out of each individual’s engagement with the idea of textiles.”The artwork in the exhibition ranges from knits to video to sculpture. Lien is including a video collaboration with J. Lorenzo Camacho ’07, a teaching assistant for the VES department; the film, “A Preemptive Maneuver” follows Vivid Luster, the alter ego of Lien and Camacho, on a mythic journey throughout the West.One of Kase’s featured pieces is a necklace, which she used as a medium because she believes it to be an object charged with notions of gender, race, and class that are often related to hip-hop.The exhibition’s broad interpretation of the use and definition of textiles gives the show an extra dimension. “It’s a really exciting multimedia exploration of something that is often relegated to one medium,” Kase says, “and the breadth of topics addressed by the show is really relevant to art-making in general.”

“You are beginning to lose your sight. You know that what you see now will be the last of what you will ever see. How do you feel? What do you do?”Student filmmaker Isidore M.T. Bethel ’11 asked Megan E. Popkin ’11 these kinds of questions in order to prepare her for her role in his most recent film, “Fell in Love with a Dead Boy.” The film, which will be screened this Saturday in the Carpenter Center, focuses on the experience of a young woman who loses her vision as she develops an obsession with John F. Kennedy ’40.Seeking to explore the boundaries between biography and fiction, Bethel created a fictional character comprised of elements of Popkin’s own life. The girl in “Fell in Love with a Dead Boy” is suffering from a blindness-inducing cancer; as a freshman in high school, Popkin was also diagnosed with a form of cancer.“I’m playing around with what gets defined as biography and what doesn’t,” Bethel says. “The movie’s prefaced by a line that says ‘Based on a true story,’ and I’m working into the question of what gets considered a true story and what doesn’t. I’m thinking of a movie like ‘Citizen Kane’ that’s become a true story… it was loosely based on the life of somebody, but then got fictionalized. Now it’s become part of the American psyche and has become a different sort of true story. That’s the recycling that I’m interested in.”“Fell in Love with a Dead Boy” is a compilation of audio recorded by Popkin, images filmed by Bethel, and a soundtrack produced by Hampshire College sophomore David Nyman. The script was a collaborative effort between Bethel and Popkin that involved Bethel presenting Popkin with scenarios and asking her to describe what she would think and feel in those situations. Approaching the film in this manner made it more real, according to Popkin, who felt that the filmmaking process allowed her to learn more about herself.“If someone says, ‘Perform it this way. Do it that way,’ it’s a lot easier in a sense... [Bethel] just, like, read it: what do you think? How would you feel in this situation? It’s a lot more personal,” Popkin says. “It shows a lot more about yourself. It’s revealing about your character, how you would act in that situation. I thought it ended it up being more real to have someone totally thrust into a situation just like this person was in the piece. It turned out to be real life.”As Bethel explores the relationship between biography and fiction, he also seeks a way to unite his passion for making movies with his desire to make a concrete change in the world around him. “For the past couple years my work has revolved around the question: what impact does anything that I do have? The way that I’ve started addressing it recently is: what if I can affect the lives of the people who are working on the video with me and then preserve those effects in the final project? This project was a gift from me to Megan, from Meg to me, and also David. I think that what other people get from the film is important but not under my control.”—Staff writer Melanie E.

Norman R. Shapiro ’51 has been affiliated with Adams House for several decades. During the 1940s and 50s, before the college began using randomization to assign student housing, he reveled in the house’s strong artistic community and later became a house tutor. “Even when I went off to make a living in the real world,” he says, “I found that I was never so far that I couldn’t come back.” Shapiro is currently a professor of Romance languages and literature at Wesleyan University and a renowned translator of French plays, poetry, and literature. Conveniently, his professional work tends to overlap with his work in Adams; he contributes to the House’s “French Farcefest,” which has occurred semiannually for the past 20 years. “They always seem to be translations of mine,” he says of past productions. The latest of these productions is “Léonie est en avance ou le mal joli”—translated by Shapiro to mean “The Pregnant Pause or Love’s Labor Lost” —an obscure 1911 one-act farce written by French playwright Georges Feydeau. During Europe’s “Golden Age,” also known as the Belle Époque, “[Feydeau] ruled the comic stage,” Shapiro says. Yet “The Pregnant Pause,” which is showing in Adams House tonight and tomorrow, is one of a group of plays that reflect a darker period in Feydeau’s life and career. “[The play] is very funny, very farcical,” Shapiro says, but it is still a departure from Feydeau’s more common fare, which normally consists of “three acts, slamming doors, going up and down staircases, [and] people being caught in places they aren’t supposed to be.”The two translations of Feydeau’s title evoke the tensions surrounding Hector Ennepeque, Feydeau’s semi-autobiographical main character, as he waits for his wife Léonie to give birth. His anxiety is exacerbated by snobby in-laws and a domineering midwife. Though the character of the midwife was a pushy Frenchwoman in the Feydeau original, Shapiro’s translation renders her a robust “German frau.” “I thought it would be a little funnier to create this Valkyrie-type character,” he says.Shapiro takes a “certain amount of liberty” with Feydeau’s work, as well as with all the works he translates. “[A translator] can’t go word for word, sentence for sentence. Something that was funny to audiences in 1895 or 1910 might not be funny now,” he explains. “There’s a responsibility to the text, and you have to be faithful to the plot, but also make people laugh. The translator definitely leaves his or her mark.”This spirit of adaptation applies to the production of the play itself. According to Shapiro, the original intent of French farce performances in Adams House was to invite a professional director to live in the house for a brief period of time in order to get to know the students before putting on a play. The auditions used to be open only to Adams residents, but more recently, it became increasingly difficult to consistently choose a full cast roster strictly from within the house. “Instead of ending a tradition,” Shapiro says, “we opened auditions up to the rest of the school and the public.”“The Pregnant Pause” is being directed by 2005 Boston College graduate Krista D’Agostino, co-founder of Holland Productions, a company that “promotes the female voice on Boston stages.” D’Agostino performed in an Adams production back in 2006. “I had a ton of fun doing it back in 2006, so I joined in on the directorial level,” she says. The entire cast of “The Pregnant Pause” is drawn from D’Agostino’s company. “People are doing so many different things that it’s hard to find [only Harvard actors],” she says.In keeping with Shapiro’s reinterpretation of the text, D’Agostino also plans to stage the production differently from Feydeau’s original. “Just so people don’t have too much of an impression of what they’re going to see already coming into the show, we’re going for a timeless approach,” she says. “Just making sure that the intention is there, audience members will still get the intention, even if the language isn’t casual, like you hear everyday,” she says, “that’s actually the fun of it.”

It isn’t often that struggling college students can make $4000 in a single weekend through legal means. But in the Student Art Show—the first of its kind at Harvard, taking place through May 4—56 student artists from varying sectors of the community will have the opportunity to display and sell their work.
“We had such a wide range of response to this event, everything from a freshman to a 35-year-old grad student,” says Margaret M. Wang ’09, co-founder of the Student Art Show. 




Students from the college, graduate schools, and the Extension school were all invited to submit to the show. Concentrating in fields as disparate as neurobiology and economics, the show’s participants demonstrate the way in which interest in art spans various sectors of Harvard. 
“It shows art as an underlying factor for so many people at the university,” says Paris A. Spies-Gans ’09, the other co-founder of the show. “I think it’s important to show how intrinsic art is to people here, even for people who aren’t art concentrators. We’re trying to show art as a convergence point for all the disciplines in all the schools.”
The idea of the Student Art Show was born last October when Jane K. Cheng ’09 inquired about a place for student art at a Harvard arts’ leaders luncheon. “Jane asked if there was a place to sell the books she made, and Drew [Faust, President of Harvard University] looks at Jack Megan, who is director of the OFA, and said, ‘Well now, there isn’t,’” Wang recalls. 
As it became clear that this was a venue the campus was lacking, Wang and Spies-Gans decided it was something they wanted to change. 
The Student Art Show garnered a significant amount of interest, receiving over 500 submissions from the Harvard community. “The amount of interest really blew us away,” Wang says. “Just the sheer number really took us by surprise. Not only the number, but the diversity.” 
With pieces costing as little as $25 and as much as $4000, the artwork ranges from traditional painting and photography to papercuts, clothing, and jewelry to abstract conversions of science into art.
“That was one thing I didn’t expect,” Spies-Gans says, referring to the science-to-art piece. “I don’t understand exactly how it works; it’s made of different circles and oval shapes—it’s all about the conceptualization of data.”
The diversity in the show is not only reflected in the artwork, but in the stories of the artists themselves. The program for the show will include short biographies of all artists, whose backgrounds range from artists who grew up with painters in the family to varsity athletes and biology students. One graduate student in the show spent time in Nepal and, consequently, all the profits resulting from the sale of his artwork are going to a charity for Nepalese orphans.
The Student Art Show not only provides a forum for the sale of student art, but also a way in which those who want to become involved with the world of curating can gain experience. The show—which was entirely student run—gave organizers the opportunity to make curatorial decisions. 
“There aren’t really any classes you can take at Harvard or internships at museums where you can actually curate art,” says Alissa E. Schapiro ’08, co-chair for the art selection and review committee. “Let’s just say it’s not easily accessible.” 
The Student Art Show is also dedicated to bringing to campus an opportunity to integrate artists into the larger professional arts community. Trying to maximize the exposure to student work, organizers contacted galleries in Boston to personally invite them to the event.  
Entirely student run, the show is able to function as a sort of microcosm of the art world, in which one not only submits and displays artwork but tackles such tasks as licenses and finance, publicity and logistics. “Probably the biggest challenge has been how to best display the artwork in the tent,” muses Spies-Gans before launching into an explication of lighting, partitions, easles, and flow. 
“There are questions like, ‘Do you do sales tax?’ And I never had to deal with sales tax for any student things at Harvard,” Wang says. (The answer is yes, they did have to use sales tax for the silent auction.)
As the Arts Task Force Report observed in December, Harvard classes tend to emphasize looking at art rather than making and presenting it. According to Thomas W. Lentz, Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museum, the Student Art Show will further the Task Force’s mission to improve the status of art on campus. 
“We’re more than happy to support this new event that I hope becomes an annual part of Arts First,” Lentz says. “By raising awareness of the presence of art-making on campus, these students are making real contributions toward the goal of better integrating the arts at Harvard.”Extending beyond the university, the Student Art Show hopes to create a dynamic venue that will motivate students to become more involved with art in their everyday experiences. “I want them to be both impressed and inspired by their peers,” Spies-Gans says, “and to want to come back next year and to incorporate the importance of art into their lives.”

If you think “Gossip Girl” is raunchy, you haven’t brushed up on your English dramaturgy. The Renaissance aristocracy had their fair share of dirty laundry, and in the rendition of John Ford’s “’Tis Pity She’s A Whore” on show in the Loeb Experimental Theatre from May 1-9, things are going to get even dirtier.Complete with contemporary costume design, a modern club scene setting, and a dirt pit constructed on stage, “’Tis Pity” is a complete reinterpretation of the Jacobean tragedy. According to Director Olivia A. Benowitz ’09, these changes were implemented so that the show will better resonate with a college crowd, even as it retains the scandalous elements that has made this particular play one of the most controversial works in English literature.“I wanted to keep people engaged, because I know that the language can be tough to get around,” Benowitz says. “So, the hip-hop music, the modern dress, and the dirt are a way to keep the play grounded in a context that the audience can understand, so that they really see what things are relevant.”The plot, which revolves around the forbidden love affair between Giovanni (Tony J. Sterle ’11) and his sister Annabella (Julianne I. Ross ’11), involves a rather convoluted storyline. However, the upbeat tempo of this production is accessible for college-age audiences.“[We] wanted it to be a sexy, really entertaining piece of theater, as well as a critique,” says Caroline R. Giuliani ’11, who plays Vasques and Donado. “It’s really hard to deliver a message to people who aren’t interested in what they are watching.”The production has incorporated a number of unique stylistic elements and techniques in addition to the modern costumes and setting. Dancers interspersed amidst the cast members are constantly on stage; their presence attempts to mimic the voyeurism of society. In addition, each actor is cast in two different roles, a decision that Ross admits has been a difficult hurdle to overcome.“I think the challenge for us as actors is to make each of our characters separate people and to give each of them distinct personalities and motivations, as opposed to just playing different characters in different costumes,” Ross says.It is not only the actors who have found themselves taking on multiple personalities and duties, however. About a month into production, a minor casting fiasco forced Benowitz to assume the roles of Hippolita and Putana on top of her directorial responsibilities.“It’s been very stressful. But it’s also been really great, because I think I’ve been able to bond with my cast in a way that I wouldn’t have done otherwise,” she says. Despite taking creative liberties with the tragedy, Benowitz believes that her particular interpretation of “’Tis Pity” remains true to the spirit of Ford’s original work. The play does not shy away from hard-hitting topics such as incestuous love affairs, adultery, and domestic violence. Yet it also seeks to portray these subjects realistically.“I read the incest as a metaphor for the things that are taboo in our own society, such as gay marriage and homosexuality in general,” Benowitz says. “Any kind of alternative lifestyle that people don’t understand, people demonize to such a degree when there are so many worse things going on in the world. [The play] bashes you over the head with its moral, but its process of doing so gives you a lot of options to interpret what you are seeing,” Benowitz adds. “You find yourself rooting for the incestuous couple in the end. That [might] make you feel a little uncomfortable, but I think it will make you come out with the sense that morality or goodness has to be judged on a case-to-case basis.”—Staff writer Eunice Y.

In the HRDC’s production “The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark,” the cast and crew dare to tamper with the sacred texts of Shakespeare. “Hamlet is this worshipped thing. A lot of Shakespeare’s works are. It’s really quite sad, I think,” says director Jason R. Vartikar ’11. “The Tragedy of Hamlet”—not to be confused with the more traditional version being staged this weekend in Leverett House’s Old Library—will show in the New College Theatre through Sunday, and it makes significant changes to the Bard’s original manuscript. “We are judging Shakespeare in a way that Shakespeare isn’t judged,” Vartikar says. “[Shakespeare] is almost a religion. It’s almost blasphemous to say that this is written poorly, and we’re going to cut it out, and we’ve definitely done that many times. We’ve cut up whole scenes; we’ve moved some things around that we think are better aesthetic choices.”The edits were made to the original text not with the intention of changing “Hamlet,” but rather to intensify and distill its spirit. “Shakespeare’s ‘Hamlet’ to me is more of a schematic of a certain part of the human condition, rather than a very specific outline of something that he thought up,” says Vartikar, defending his decision to rework the script. “There are some changes that I wouldn’t want to reveal, which are surprising and will be recognizable but will still feel Shakespearean and still feel beautiful.”On top of changes to the script, the number of characters has been reduced and lines have been shifted from one character to another. For example, the roles of Gertrude and Ophelia have been greatly expanded. “They’re less soft,” Vartikar says. “More hard, easier to read, more surreal, raw.”Vartikar’s changes to the text were informed by the philosophies of Heiner Müller and James Joyce. “Some scholars would definitely disagree, but we think it’s an interesting interpretation,” Vartikar says. “The tragedy of Hamlet is not delay. Our interpretation is that Hamlet is crushed to the ground by his inexorable fate, by the weight of the world, the weight of his scenario. That interpretation is very Joycean, because Ulysses is about this complex thing, which is a very crushing atmosphere.”Joyce’s references to Hamlet in his own works also had concrete influences on the play. “There are some surprises I want to keep for the show, but basically, Joyce has a discussion in ‘Ulysses’ that is very subtle about Hamlet being a woman. That was huge,” says executive producer Rachel D. Libeskind ’11. “To me it’s always been this interesting idea, of Hamlet as a feminine character. I think ‘Ulysses’ has an inexorable link to Hamlet that I can talk about for hours upon hours.”Vartikar’s iconoclasm extends not only towards the works of Shakespeare but also towards theatrical conventions in general. For example, he decided against a soundtrack. “I hate theatery things, things that look and feel so theatery, these really cheesy soundtracks, piano music, highlighting moments by having tracks under it. It’s very trying to be cinema, trying to be movie,” Vartikar says. “Theater’s more alive with a heartbeat. It’s more about people interacting in front of us. It’s about the schematic coming to life.”“The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark” attempts to bring Shakespeare’s schema to life in an authentic way through the changes it makes to the original text and its artistic decisions.  “It’s completely Shakespeare,” Vartikar says. “I think Shakespeare would have been very proud of what this is.”

After 15 years as a high-tech entrepreneur and a brief stint at the Harvard Kennedy School studying environmental policy, Bill M. Haney ’84-’86 decided to start making movies. “I didn’t go to school for it, didn’t study it. I just found people who were thoughtful and who knew a lot about film and I listened to them,” Haney says. 13 movies later, the writer/producer’s new feature film, “American Violet,” combines political and social advocacy with old-fashioned dramatic storytelling, two cornerstones of Haney’s approach to film.Though he founded his first start-up, Fuel Tech, when he was an 18-year-old freshman in Straus, his film career took years to begin. His first documentary, “Gift of the Game,” explored U.S.-Cuba relations through baseball and Ernest Hemingway. Later documentaries centered on other social, political, and environmental concerns, covering topics from ocean preservation and whale biology to the Caribbean sugar cane industry.In 2002, Haney was listening to National Public Radio on the drive home from work when he heard a piece that drove him to tears. The story was about a 24-year-old single black mother in Texas who had been wrongfully accused of dealing narcotics after a raid on the housing projects where she lived. She was given two options: a plea bargain, which would release her as a convicted felon in exchange for pleading guilty, or 15-25 years in prison. In the face of a tyrannical district attorney with a racist bent, and a push to convict in order to receive state funds, the principle of “innocent until proven guilty” quickly fell by the wayside.“It was just so emotional—the story of this young woman assaulted by the criminal justice system and given such a horrible set of choices,” Haney says. “American Violet” is closely based on the story of this woman, who, in the film, quickly realizes her situation is not unique and teams up with an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer to fight the district attorney and reverse the court’s wrongful convictions.Though roughly half of Haney’s movies are documentaries, he felt this material was more suited to a feature film. “Because it’s based on a real-world story, because many of the characters are still alive, and because many of these issues are so important, we had to find a way to tell the inspiring and dramatically compelling truth, and to root it in authenticity,” Haney says. “So that the reaction would be almost visceral, so that you would feel it more than think about it.”To this end, Haney cast actors that he felt would cut straight to the core of each character. “The best actors have a shorthand for expressing the emotional life of a character that even the real character can’t quite express as comfortably,” he says. Haney cast up-and-comer Nicole Beharie as female protagonist Dee Roberts. Joining Beharie in the film are veteran actors like Alfre Woodard, Tim Blake Nelson, and Charles Dutton.The 2000 U.S. presidential election constitutes both the political and visual subtexts of the storyline, with frequent shots of the campaigns of George W. Bush and Al Gore ’69 spliced into the film. Not only does this maintain the historical accuracy of the story, it also reveals a disturbing layer of irony in campaign rhetoric.“At the very time that George Bush was running for president, talking about how he didn’t believe in quota systems, he was using quota systems for distributing money in Texas,” Haney says. These systems—which allocate state funds based on the number of convictions made by the state’s drug task force—are indirectly responsible for the heroine’s conviction in “American Violet.” But Haney insists that “American Violet” will transcend its moral and political content. “One of the challenges of filmmaking in America is that generally, movies like ours get presented to the public as ‘important,’ and to the public it’s kind of like eating your vegetables,” he says. “It’s good for you, but you’ll probably go for ice cream instead.” “American Violet,” Haney says, will engage and entertain its viewers more than the theatrical equivalent of broccoli might. “And there are some great performances, about things in life that matter to young people,” he adds.“The essential point of this story for me,” Haney says, “is the inspirational leadership of this one ordinary woman.”

If there is one term in popular music that exemplifies misnomer, it is “supergroup.” Coined to describe Cream, a band whose members did their best work together, its meaning has changed radically over the years, such that any assortment of has-beens are dubbed a “supergroup” when they are anything but. To mention two supergroups of this decade, Audioslave euthanized the fury and passion of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine into dull, MOR post-grunge, while Velvet Revolver strengthened the case for a mandatory retirement age for heavy metal musicians. On the evidence of this eponymous debut album, Tinted Windows fits the bill of the 21st century supergroup, not its 1970s counterpart.The first rule of the 21st century supergroup is that it is less than the sum of its parts. To be fair to Tinted Windows, its parts are pretty impressive. Perhaps the biggest tribute to James Iha’s talent is the sheer awfulness of “Zeitgeist,” the 2007 album Smashing Pumpkins made without him. Bassist Adam Schlesinger and drummer Bun E. Carlos have similarly impressive resumes with Fountains of Wayne and Cheap Trick, respectively; singer Taylor Hanson is the only one whose career does not invite the same kind of respect, and even his presence adds interest, if only for the strangeness of the interaction between his background in teen pop and the backgrounds of his new bandmates.There is no doubt, then, that Tinted Windows makes for an intriguing prospect. But the actual product has little in common with the past achievements of the bandmembers. Tinted Windows is 36 minutes of three-chord power-pop, and one is hard-pressed to find any connection to the textural diversity of “Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,” Smashing Pumpkins’ 1995 masterwork, or to the sheer energy of Cheap Trick’s “Heaven Tonight.” To be sure, both Fountains of Wayne and Cheap Trick superficially occupied a similar power pop sphere, but a comparison with these bands only serves to better illustrate this album’s deficiencies.Tinted Windows actually opens fairly promisingly; “Kind of a Girl,” which is also the album’s first single, is a raucous, addictive ditty that despite its profligate use of “oh-whoahs” and “oh-ohs” is hooky enough to set the album up nicely. “Messing With My Head” is a little less cutesy but just as catchy. Track three, “Dead Serious”, is the album’s high point, with a pretty verse melody and sing-along chorus.But “Dead Serious” is most important for its lyrical tone of exaggerated earnestness. “I’m serious / Dead serious / And you’ve got to take me at my word / Forget what you’ve heard / Because this time all I really want to say / is that I need you everyday / Hey hey hey,” Hanson sings, in a masterful parody of the ponderous nature of pop-rock love songs. At this point, “Dead Serious” appears to be the album’s thematic core—after all, glorious silliness has always been the currency of the best power-pop. Cheap Trick were so successful in part because of how cheerful they were about their triviality, delivering the lines “I want you to want me / I need you to need me” with unabashed gusto. Tinted Windows fail to match up to Cheap Trick in part because the rest of the album fails to maintain the melodic quality of the first three songs. Power pop sans hooks is music that has entirely lost its raison d’être, and most of the album disappoints on this count, with generic, unmemorable riffs and bland choruses. But an even more egregious failure is the lyrical descent from enjoyable silliness to ponderous platitudes. Not only would such lines as “Without love you have nothing to shoot for” do James Blunt or Chris Martin proud, they are sung not as parody but, rather, in earnest, and thus serve as the very antithesis of the ideal that Cheap Trick and Fountains of Wayne and “Dead Serious” stand for. Yet it is this kind of platitude that dominates much of this album.Taylor Hanson, who as the 1990s version of Nick Jonas might be expected to be the weak link, turns out to be Tinted Windows’ most pleasant surprise. His clear tenor is a perfect fit for this kind of music, as is his skill at both soulful strength and supple falsetto. By contrast, admirers of 90s era Smashing Pumpkins are likely to be perplexed by James Iha’s new choice of genre. Schlesinger and Carlos made their careers with bands who were characterized by their wit and verve. Tinted Windows have neither. It is fortunate, then, that this is more side project than band per se, as the four members are continuing with their other projects. This well-intentioned attempt at collaboration is likely to be a forgotten one-off.

“Beyond Here Lies Nothing,” the first song on Bob Dylan’s 33rd studio album, “Together Through Life,” opens with a cool exchange of trumpet and electric guitar, over a brilliant circular drumline. Dylan’s voice emerges with style and authority. He sings about love. He sings about desolation. He sings about life. Somehow, even after a trilogy of masterpieces—1997’s “Time Out of Mind,” 2001’s “Love and Theft,’” and 2006’s “Modern Times”—it’s still a surprise to hear the legend at the height of power, singing with an authority that his age has finally caught up to. And why shouldn’t it be? Dylan’s always been measured by a unique standard, and now, pushing 70, he’s become the paradigm for the stately elder rock star. The song goes on, confirming the unalienable right to get excited about a new Bob Dylan album. The accordions that come in don’t distract, even if they don’t add very much, and altogether it’s sounding like another victory. But that’s as good as it gets. “Together Through Life” is not a disaster. Dylan’s true disasters, like political putsches or catastrophic weather systems, draw a bewildering sort of fascination—think “Dylan & The Dead,” his born-again Christian phase, or the infamous “Self Portrait”—that this album never inspires in the listener. Mere failure seems a more appropriate categorization, but that would make the mistake of confusing expectations surrounding Dylan’s work—today or almost half a century ago—with the expectations for any other performer. Listen to enough Bob Dylan, and you’ll realize that none of his albums are failures. Some resonate with the public and some don’t, but every one of them is a record Dylan wanted to make in the moment: each is definitive in its own way. But “Together Through Life” is definitive in a way that is, at once, disappointing and unremarkable.“Time Out of Mind” was more than a change in fortune for Dylan; it was a change in philosophy, and until “Together Through Life,” that fact was easy to forget. After two albums consisting entirely of folk covers on acoustic guitar, “Time Out of Mind” saw Dylan stepping away from a bare musician’s role and toward a more auteristic philosophy, prompted by Daniel Lanois’ production. The arrangements on that album were lush and spacious, propelled by lively performances from seasoned studio musicians—his tightest band since the mid-70s. Dylan produced the three albums that followed on his own (credited as “Jack Frost”) but he’s maintained the standard that Lanois set, framing his wry, enigmatic lyrics with an organic, energized sound anchored by longtime collaborator, bassist Tony Garnier.But on “Together Through Life,” production easily outpaces songwriting, as Dylan’s ambition and lyrical wit fade palpably into monotony. His latter-day trilogy was a compelling mixture of urgency and ease, of innovative arrangements and sage-like lyricism. On this album, the studio approach is identical, albeit in the absence of that same inspiration. The presence of accordions and fiddles, or a slightly sharper guitar sound, doesn’t do much to thwart the dominant impression that we’re in distinctly familiar, necessarily more boring territory. Variations on the blues format have lately become fallbacks for Dylan, but they were always convincing before. Here, he doesn’t revive a blues aesthetic so much as he regurgitates its tropes on the awkward “My Wife’s Home Town,” or the downright embarrassing “It’s All Good,” both of which could have been just as palatable as their predecessors if they weren’t so generally lazy. Thankfully, these are the album’s lowest lows, but what distinguishes them from the remaining eight songs isn’t the degree of quality so much as the degree of care.It speaks to the album’s ambivalence toward creative development that it’s brightest moments, other than the opener, distinguish themselves as strong contenders for spots on his previous records. “I Feel A Change Comin’ On” has all the charm and satisfaction of the more hopeful songs on “Modern Times,” with polished musicianship and a luxurious pace. “Shake Shake Mama,” a blues workout as simple as its title, would be right at home on “’Love and Theft.’” The remainder is largely more obvious mimicry—“Forgetful Heart,” a warmed-over, condensed version of “Ain’t Talkin’”; “Life Is Hard,” a sparer, more stilted version of “Spirit on the Water,” punctuated by more vaguely derivative, but equally middling material.So “Together Through Life” is a regression, a forgetful footnote to the decade of Dylan’s critical resurgence. Even in this decade, Dylan’s catalog is so strong that its legacy can suffer one featherweight album, but what’s so frustrating about “Together Through Life” is that it simply didn’t need to be recorded. It’s a troublesome sign of what may be to come in the remainder of the man’s studio career, and what has already become of his skippable live act: stripped of any real novel artistic drive, “Together Through Life” seems driven by the bare will to perform.—Staff writer Ryan J. Meehan can be reached at rmeehan@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being a full-time student at Harvard is enough to make anyone’s head spin. But try being a biomedical engineering concentrator and contemporary dancer as well as a ballerina. This is the case for Lauren E. Chin ’08-’09. Luckily, her poise and grace managed to carry her pirouetting to the OFA’s Suzanne Farrell Dance Award. The prize—whose namesake was once the prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet—is given to the Harvard undergraduate who has demonstrated exemplary artistry in the field of dance. Chin’s impressive dancing is matched only by her skillful balancing of schoolwork with artistic pursuits, all the while maintaining infectious optimism and an upbeat, casual attitude.“She has an incredible, positive, practical, energetic way of being,” remarks James C. Fuller ’10, former co-director of the Harvard Ballet Company (HBC) and one of Chin’s dance partners. “I don’t actually know how she does what she does, but it certainly does not seem like she is gritting her teeth.”Chin has been dancing since she was three, and has made great strides from the first time she donned pointe shoes at age 11. When she was just 16, she left home to perform with a professional company in Ohio. She then became a member of the HBC in 2004, although for Chin, ballet has lately been eclipsed by other forms of dance.“I realized I love dance, but not ballet,” Chin says. “There’s so much in the world of dance that I moved towards the contemporary and modern dance track.”Though she has remained with the HBC through her Harvard career, she sees several advantages to contemporary dance. “It’s unfortunate… the most cutting edge choreographers are outside of ballet, and that is what I am most interested in,” she says.“With contemporary dance, you do not have to be 16 years old,” she adds. “You can actually still be dancing at 20.”This summer, Chin will be transferring her contemporary dance skills from the Harvard Contemporary Dance Ensemble to several prestigious summer programs. For the last semester, she has worked as a teaching fellow for Dramatic Arts 127: “Rite of Spring at the Nexus of Artand Ritual.” The creator of this class, visiting lecturer Christine W. Dakin, will be sending Chin to her program, Danzefest, in Italy. In June, Chin will also be attending Springboard Danse Montreal, a program founded by a Julliard professor that accepts just 60 dancers from the country’s best conservatories. Despite the many artistic opportunities coming her way, Chin remains grounded and humbled by the Harvard community.“For me the biggest element is to know that I have such amazing support,” she says of winning the OFA’s award. “To know the most involved people in the arts would select me from all the other extremely dedicated people is really wonderful to know. I feel like I have really contributed something.”According to Fuller, she has been one of the most active and involved people in dance productions at Harvard.“She brings so much energy, enthusiasm, and insight into everything that she does,” he says. “She always dances to her fullest and I think she inspires everyone in the room to dance as best they can. She is a really wonderful person to work and dance with.”

Some students look back on their college artistic careers and remember standing ovations after plays or accepting praise as they stood beside their art work during gallery receptions. Benjamin T. Clark ’09, however, has taken a more independent path through the Harvard arts scene as technical director of a large portion of the sets for Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club productions. He has spent countless hours in the Loeb shop crafting scenes, working in the grid, and ensuring the safety of all involved in plays. “Me and Bruce [Springsteen] in the shop, that’s the last four years in a nutshell,” Clark says. Beyond the rewards of hours spent listening to The Boss, technical theater has offered Clark a fulfilling creative medium. Clark became the HRDC tech liaison—a member of the HRDC board that oversees all technical aspects of productions and ensures the safety of all involved—his sophomore year, when the former tech liaison dropped out. He continued as tech liaison through his junior year. Clark’s love for carpentry, rigging, and lights began in middle school and continued through high school. His father and brother did stage crew throughout high school, but only he carried it on through college. “I did theater for the alcohol and the women,” Clark says, when asked where his interest came from. “And the smokes.” When he came to Harvard, Clark found that few shared his passion. “Not many people are interested in carpentry at Harvard,” he says. “I like working with my hands. It’s unusual to be able to do that at Harvard.” Despite this isolation, Clark rose to the enormous challenge of filling in the technical gaps in HRDC’s often ambitious projects. “Theater technicians are like water. Tech theater is like goldfish,” Clarks says. “You know how goldfish will grow to fit their bowl? So do we, kicking and screaming.”Clark has gone beyond the basic requirements of “growing to fit the bowl.” He sacrificed a spring break his sophomore year to revitalize a flagging production and spent 30 hours during the week and 20 over the weekend in the theatre his sophomore and junior years. “Looking back, I realized I spent more time in Loeb than anywhere else, even my dorm room,” Clark says. Clark’s talents extend beyond his abilities to create sets. “I think the most remarkable thing about Ben is that he’s so talented at so many things,” says Sara E.A. Mills ’11, who worked with Clark on a variety of productions. Beyond his ability to build and organize a set, Clark is also a talented actor. Though he has acted in seven plays, which amounts to a fairly substantial Harvard acting career, Clark nonchalantly downplays his achievement. “I tend to always play the same character,” he says. “The strong, male character.”Clark derives great satisfaction from his ability to help produce plays and sooth conflicts among members of the cast, and his abilities are well appreciated among members of the Harvard theater community. After graduation, Clark hopes to stay in Boston and find a job in the tech department of a theatre, where he can continue to utilize these talents. “Theater beats a normal job. Let’s put it that way,” Clark says. “And the people are crazy, in a good way.”

An amazing voice and outstanding performing faculty are some of the qualities that earned Rachel E. Flynn ’09 the Radcliffe Doris Cohen Levi Prize for achieving excellence in an extensive repertoire of musical theater.“It was such an honor,” she says. “The OFA has been such a tremendous organization of support who have been so wonderful in coming to our shows and being behind us. It was lovely to get this prize.” A college-long member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, she recently starred as Luisa Contini in the New College Theatre production of “Nine” and as Mrs. Lovett in last year’s Loeb Mainstage performance of “Sweeny Todd.” Of all her roles, Flynn cherishes this one the most.  “It was an incredible experience. We were lucky because the movie was just coming out and President Faust, who is such a huge supporter of the arts, came to watch along with many of the faculty,” Flynn says. “We had sold out shows and it felt like you got to be a rock star for a little bit. It was a crazy show to be a part of.” Flynn relishes performing in musical theater for its combination of the best of two worlds: singing and acting. At an early age, Flynn was influenced by the presence of music and theater in her household. Her father is a guitarist and her older sister is an actress and a playwright. Flynn started singing in elementary school and began performing later on, taking part in community and school theater; she also participated in singing competitions and performed at weddings and other smaller occasions.   Unsure that she was going to continue pursuing her interests in the arts, Flynn decided to enroll in the Harvard orientation Freshman Arts Program (FAP); she ended up sticking with it as a leader for the next three years, holding the position of senior proctor this year and serving an instrumental role in running the program and organizing the events for the incoming freshman.“The ones that I’m leaving with the most memories of and the ones who have shaped who I am both as a performer and as a Harvard person are the shows through the HRDC and my experience [with] FAP,” Flynn says. “I’ve been involved with both for four years, and I’d be a very different actress and singer if  I wasn’t involved in those two organizations.” Flynn realized halfway through her first year at Harvard that she was going to pursue a career in musical theater, and now she will be “creatively unemployed” next year, as she will move to New York City to try her luck in making it on the big stage: Broadway. Flynn has come a long way from her beginnings as an irresolute freshman, and it all started with a change of perspective: “Realizing that going to Harvard and doing theater weren’t two separate things was important, because seeing that that was a possibility made me say ‘Ok, I guess I can do this for four years.’”

It’s easy to look at the empty Loeb Mainstage—a cavernous 556-seat theatre—and see only a bare, dark void. For set designer Grace C. Laubacher ’09, however, the theatre becomes a blank canvas, the medium for her art. From the skeletal, caged streets of London in “Sweeney Todd” to the scientific underworld of “The Space Between,” Laubacher has been set designer and technical director for more than 20 productions on campus.In recognition of her extensive work, Laubacher, who is also a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and co-founder of the Harvard Stage Designers’ Collective, has been awarded the OFA’s Council Prize in Visual Arts and the first Alan Symonds Memorial Award for work in technical theater. “It’s exciting to have set design called a visual art form, because there’s a way in which theater is thought of as performance based even though it’s so much more than that,” Laubacher says. “So to sort of have an element of theater cross the boundary between performance and visual arts is exciting.”Visual arts were not always Laubacher’s main focus, however. “I was a jock my freshman year of high school and played three sports,” she says. “My sophomore fall I didn’t have anything to do. I attempted to be a performer and sucked at it, so I tried out tech.” A strong program at her high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, drew her into the theater world. After that, there was no looking back. Laubacher even served as an intern for the celebrated Williamstown Theatre Festival one summer, where she learned about commercial work in the arts.“The community of great people who were handy but also design-oriented attracted me, but I fell in love with the actual art form,” Laubacher says. “When I got to Harvard, it was a perfect way to get involved in a student group and play an integral role from an early stage.” Building this sense of community was the motivation behind HSDC, a group that hopes to serve as a forum where students interested in stage design and technology can connect. “There’s a tendency for techies and designers to spread themselves out,” Laubacher says. “There’s no unifying impetus for them to get together and share ideas and collaborate and learn from each other, so the idea is to offer a home for those people and provide continuity.” For Laubacher, who learned most of her design skills through hands-on experience, peer mentoring is a priority.“The most learning happens when you’re able to make mistakes and see where they lead you. I started working in the shop in the Loeb not knowing what a screw gun did and went from there,” she explains.Laubacher’s trial-and-error philosophy allows for mistakes, guesswork, and creative intuition, as well as a great deal of collaboration. The set for “Sweeney Todd” is closest to her heart because its versatile and striking design was produced by group effort. “In a really profound way, every work of a single individual is the work of a group,” Laubacher says.Still, it is Laubacher’s own creativity and talent that have ultimately produced effective and stunning sets. “I develop a world in which the story takes place and makes sense, spreading the search far and wide for inspiration and not staying confined to the literal world of play,” she says. Laubacher’s latest endeavor was designing the set of “The Space Between,” a complex and multilayered show that demands an equally multi-textured stage, complete with two moving trees and a raised platform on which videos are projected. “The trees function as the origin of human knowledge, like in the story of Eden,” she says. “The physical form itself of the trees is mirrored on the shape of a mushroom cloud. A lot of it came to me really intuitively; it just felt right. It was difficult in a great way.”Laubacher will continue to practice design at the prestigious Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, part of the University of the Arts London. “The boundaries between art forms are blurring,” Laubacher says. “I want to bring design to a new level in a performance setting.”—Staff writer Ali R.

Do you consider electric fans, postcards, watermelons, and dollar bills art? Darren Bader, a New York-based artist known for his imaginative use of space in installations, thinks so, but he wants to know what you think. Yesterday, Bader engaged with students in a conversation about the definition of contemporary art.Bader’s philosophy is “anything goes,” and he leaves behind the studio as his primary place of production. He breaks conventional perceptions of objects and space by placing them in direct, unexpected conversations with one another. Continuing on the avant-garde trajectory of post-studio practice, Bader works on the belief that anything that is visual can be qualified as art. His 2007 installation, “as = poaching the poachers” at New York’s Rivington Arms, for example, consisted of objects like the ones listed above placed next to each other without an immediately apparent pattern. It explored and challenged the binary relationship between space and object, optical and tactile perceptions. “What art is is based on each individual, how it’s understood and its day-to-day interpretations,” Bader said in an interview. “It’s about what art means in a contemporary sense, not in a museological sense, but in a more loose, abstract, and poetic sense.”Amy J. Lien ’09 met Bader at an art show in New York City where the two had a productive conversation that she wanted to bring to Harvard. Lien thought the talk would be a good opportunity for students to be exposed to a contemporary artist from a younger generation. Often, according to Lien, students are taught the usual canon of more visible and older artists who may not necessarily be relevant or interesting to them.Bader consciously wanted to remove himself from members of such a canon in his talk. He doesn’t see himself as an authority figure. He is interested in what the students have to say about art, a term he believes is up to individual interpretation. By coming to Harvard, Bader wanted to see how individuals who are 10 years younger than he is perceive art and wanted to give the students control of the discussion. “I’m more interested in questions than talking to myself and getting answers,” Bader said. “Talking about art is the primary means of creating art, potentially. It perpetuates the dialogue of art creation. Ideas are important.”Bader hoped that the discussion would perpetuate an active dialogue about the definition of art in the contemporary world, among professionals and students.

Tomorrow, aliens will be invading the Science Center! Luckily, these aliens are just friendly creations of the Harvard Story-Time Players’ (HSTP) original interactive musical, “A Space Adventure,” co-directed by Sarah F. Schlegel ’10 and Qi Yu ’11. Written, produced, directed, and performed by students, “A Space Adventure” follows mischievous aliens who go off on interplanetary adventures, encountering many comical characters along the way, only to discover that there’s no place like home. While HSTP typically performs shows to entertain and cheer up children in Boston area hospitals, “A Space Adventure” is being presented on campus as lighter theatrical fare for any one wishing to revisit a small part of his childhood. “The show is more for sheer entertainment than our usual public service function,” says HSTP president Hunter H.A. Landerholm ’09. Though the show is primarily designed for children, its organizers are convinced that older audiences will still appreciate it. “A Space Adventure” delivers positive life lessons for all, encouraging enthusiasm for learning and warning against judging a book by its cover.“Older members of our audiences will get a good laugh at the silly antics we put in the show and appreciate the creativity that was put into the costume and set design,” Yu says. The set and props are economical and practical, to allow for easy travel to and from hospitals, but this does not detract from their creativeness; according to Landerholm, “They tend to be bright colors, very flashy, and fun for the kids.”For the first time in years, HSTP’s show also incorporates song and dance. “Music always cheers people up,” Landerholm says. “If we can provide 15 minutes of a bright spot in people’s days, then that’s great.”—Staff writer Ali R.

Can you handle the truth? In their debut show, “The Truth,” Freestyle Electronica plans to find out. Performing at the Queen’s Head tomorrow at 4 p.m., three Pforzheimer musicians will join forces to create a fresh new sound in the media of both rap and electronica. Emanuel Beica ’11, Nathan C.M. Leiby ’10, and Lev A. Shaket ’10 will use their music to test the audience’s capacity to hear “the truth” about politics and war, among other things.“I will rap about the Iraq War from the point of view of a soldier who was wounded in it,” Beica wrote in an email. “We will be talking about the true nature of Harvard and its numerous investment-banker wannabes, and much more.”While Beica will tackle potentially touchy subjects, Shaket will mix some jokes into his freestyle performance in hopes of connecting on a more personal level with the crowd.“I’m mainly joking around on the mic and rapping about everyday life,” Shaket wrote in an email. “If the crowd wants it, I’ll freestyle a bit. If someone wants to battle, they’re welcome to come up on stage and show what they’ve got.”Finally, Leiby will play DJ, mixing together the intro and outro of the performance, combining techno with rap.Arts First will mark the musicians’ first performance together. Banking on a good pub atmosphere, Freestyle Electronica hopes to wow the crowd with their sugarcoat-free rap and electronic beats.

Clay D. Miller ’10, President of the Harvard Magic Society, refers to what his society does as “illusions.” Then he pauses. “They’re tricks, not illusions,” he says.Founded in 2001, the Magic Society currently counts about half a dozen active members, each an expert in a different kind of magic. On Saturday, the group will enchant audiences both young and old with their craft in the annual Arts First Magic Show.The group has talent, Miller says, and past shows have been very successful. “It is always a lot of fun,” he says. Members lose and find coins and cards in ways that often take years to learn. One former Harvard magician, Harrison R. Greenbaum ’08 has even become a professional in New York. But the logistics of this year’s show bring new challenges, Miller says. Instead of at their usual location in the Science Center, the Society will be practicing their craft outside, on the steps of Memorial Church. This changes particulars of the performance. “We are good at magic that is close up and personal,” Jeff F. Solnet ’12, a member of the Society, says. “The challenge is bringing some of these effects to a large audience.”Miller agrees. “Inside, the audience is seated and you can build on what you are doing. In an outdoor location, however, “You need to catch people’s attention who are walking by.”Commanding a crowd should be a no problem for the group, which Miller describes as often “larger than life.” “I like to try to be hokey, especially for the kids,” Miller says. Accordingly, the tricks performed—cards going blank, disappearing coins and rope tricks—draw from the familiar canon of magic deeds.The mixed audience, made up of both Harvard students and local families, dictates a wide-ranging spectacle. “We try to keep it fun for everybody,” Miller says. “We don’t tell any dirty jokes.”—Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz can be reached at mschwart@fas.harvard.edu.

Despite their label as a cover band, the group slated to perform as the Rod Stewart Tribute Band during Arts First weekend has a surprisingly varied catalogue. Over the last few weeks, they’ve perfected a repertoire of pop hits—ranging from Rod Stewart’s “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy” to the Dire Straits’ “Walk of Life” and Prince’s “Erotic City”— to be performed tomorrow at their multimedia event “Your Favorite Stars” in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub.The Rod Stewart Tribute Band features Anna J. Murphy ’12 on keyboard, Julene V. Paul ’12 on harmonica, and Ruthe J. Foushee ’12 on ukulele, with all three sharing vocal duties. The band’s origins are attributable in part to common dorm and in part to common interest. “It kind of came out of an online karaoke program and a six dollar keyboard from Ebay,” Paul says. “It was birthed out of Arts First.” Though the girls are set to play as the Rod Stewart Tribute Band, the three Canaday residents have adopted the band name Captain and Captain and Captain and Tennille based on the American pop music duo made famous by chart-toppers like “Muskrat Love” and “Love Will Keep Us Together.”According to the band, “It came out of Anna buying three captain hats on Ebay and then making a multimedia piece based on the one-hit wonder.” Rounding out the three female “Captains” is Tenille, who, according to Paul “is not a real human being but Anna’s creation made for her VES project.”The band will be part of Saturday’s “Performance Fair,” a four-hour multi-venue event featuring over 100 specific performances. This idea, according to Matt Weinberg, the Associate Project Manager for Arts First, came from actor John A. Lithgow ’67. Weinberg contends that the Queen’s Head is an ideal venue for alternative artistic performers like Captain and Captain and Captain and Tennille and rock bands and stand-up comedians. “We want the rock bands to play as loud as they want and at the Queen’s Head they can do that,” he says.Rather than being a typical music show, this performance is a multimedia experience. “It’s part music performance and part art or video performance, an inevitable merging of different types of pop culture,” Murphy says. “It will not be just a conventional performance.” According to the band, Murphy plans and arranges the songs with a software program and puts them to backing tracks and video. “Even though we only have five minutes to set up, our vision would be to find lots and lots of things to put on the stage for a projection show,” Paul says. To classify their multimedia description, “there will be videos, video art, performance, interpretive dance, and combat,” the band says. “There will probably be some violence.”While this is a special performance, it may be the last chance to see the group perform under this name. “After this we might have to retire as Captain and Captain and Captain and Tennille unless something more comes from the Arts First weekend,” Paul says. “The last show will probably be this weekend.”

Reading a poem by John Ashbery ’49 for the first time feels like walking into the room of a stranger. The space is mysterious; the language, unfamiliar. There is some sort of order, but it is known only to the owner. Slowly, though, orienting details emerge. Ashbery’s words take on a reassuring rhythm, thrumming steadily, visually, against the walls of the mind. Gradually one gets one’s bearings, locating oneself within the discursive beauty. “How does it feel to be outside and inside at the same time, / The delicious feeling of the air contradicting and secretly abetting / The interior warmth?” asks Ashbery in “The Bungalows,” lines that could apply to his work itself.
Ashbery’s experimental tendencies once marked him as a figure of the avant-garde, but his enigmatic, intensely introspective brand of poetry has been receiving much popular acclaim of late. A bound Library of America edition anthologized his collected works in 2008, an honor accorded to the likes of Emerson and Whitman, and a course setting his work alongside Philip Larkin’s was offered at Harvard this spring. To top it off, yesterday President Faust presented Ashbery, now 81 years old, with the 2009 Harvard Arts Medal for “excellence in the arts and contributions to education and the public good through arts.”
The tributes to his work as a cohesive whole are deserved. Despite divergences in thematic and stylistic approach over the decades, there is a kind of unity to his lifetime oeuvre. Ashbery feels that it has evolved to become “more and more like itself.” 
“I look at old poems of mine and they seem very much like the recent ones, except the recent ones have a resonance that comes from having lived so many years,” he says. “But there is a family resemblance among them.”
It wasn’t always so clear that a career in writing was Ashbery’s calling. In high school, he wanted to be a painter, until he was awarded an anthology of twentieth-century poetry for winning an essay contest. Reading the work was a transformative experience, and he entered college determined to concentrate in English.
Ashbery recalls his years at Harvard fondly as a “particularly happy period” in his life, where for the first time he met others as interested in the arts as he was. Once on campus, he gravitated to various literary extracurriculars, including the Harvard Advocate, for which he edited the poetry section, and the Signet Society, which he remembers as a “nice, genteel place to drop in for lunch.”
Academically, he received a broad education, participating in one of Harvard’s first poetry workshops and immersing himself in the work of Surrealist painters Max Ernst and Joan Miró in a class on 20th century art. Ashbery did write a thesis, on W.H. Auden, though he has always considered himself more of a poet than a critic. “I think of the two as opposites,” he says. “Writing poetry is striking out and finding something you don’t know yet, whereas criticism is dealing with something you do know about or are about to know about.”
A few of Ashbery’s poems were published in the Advocate during his time at Harvard, but his real breakthrough came post-graduation. His poetic debut, “Some Trees,” was selected by Auden to be published as part of the Yale Series of Younger Poets in 1956, kick-starting a prolific career distinguished by the release of another critically acclaimed work every few years. It was in 1975 that major recognition arrived, however, when he bagged all three of the nation’s major poetry prizes—the Pulitzer, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the National Book Award—for his collection “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.” Since then, he has continued to innovate, experimenting with double columns, shorter forms, and artistic perspectives.
In the title poem of “Self-Portrait,” Ashbery addresses 16th century painter Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola: “Whose curved hand controls, / Francesco, the turning seasons and the thoughts / That peel off and fly away at breathless speeds / Like the last stubborn leaves ripped / From wet branches?” The lines are typical Ashbery—both contemplative and frenzied, an ecstasy of stillness. 
This very focus on consciousness and the process of thinking, however, has won him a reputation as a “difficult” poet. Helen Vendler once likened the experience of reading Ashbery to “playing hide-and-seek in a sprawling mansion designed by M. C. Escher.” One of his early collections in particular, 1962’s “The Tennis Court Oath,” has garnered criticism for its fragmentation, lack of punctuation, and seeming disregard for narrative.
Ashbery brushes aside these critiques as overly analytical. “I don’t think it’s difficult if one lets it approach one the way one hears music, just letting it wash over you,” he says. “My poetry is like music in a way—it comes and happens over a period of time and leads you into it. You kind of live it for a while, as opposed to, say, a picture, which you look at for a few minutes and walk away from.”
He believes that concerns over difficulty also lead people to overlook the lighthearted element in his work, which frequently incorporates parody, quotes, and pop culture for a collage-like effect. “I think I’m a rather funny person,” he says. “I like my poems to include as many things in them as possible. Humor, tragedy, love, time, all the things that are traditional in poetry—I like having them happening all at once.”
Now that he’s retired from teaching at the various university writing programs where he taught in the ’70s and ’80s, Ashbery’s daily schedule is relatively relaxed. He spends much of his day at home in Hudson or New York City reading books of poetry sent to him by publishers, keeping up with current events, and listening to music, mostly twentieth century classical pieces by composers like John Cage and Elliott Carter. “I’m very disorganized,” he laughs. “I sort of imagine I’m going to write and put it off to the last possible moment, maybe late afternoon. Then I mostly don’t get around to doing it.” Some days, he doesn’t write a single word.
But clearly, he remains productive. A collection of his most recent poems, entitled “Planisphere,” will be published this December. A planisphere is a two-dimensional projection of a sphere onto a plane, such as a world map or an astronomical chart. Ashbery is reluctant to provide a direct explanation for this title in terms of his poems, preferring instead to let the work speak for itself. Still, he does say that “in a way, every piece of writing is a two-dimensional rendering of life, which is three-dimensional.”
Ashbery’s own life has indeed been one of many dimensions. Though he chuckles when asked why he thinks he’s receiving the award (“Somebody at Harvard must think I do something for the ‘public good.’”), he notes the poetic justice of capping his career with a medal from the institution where he got his start. “It’s very nice to get something from Harvard, where I set out from long ago,” he says. “There is a certain symmetry to it.”—Staff writer Jessica A.

If you have any objections to the settlement struck between Google Books Search and the publishing industry, you better send it out soon. All objections must be postmarked May 5, 2009 or earlier. And objections, of course, are being raised from all sides.The settlement has been under fire from the moment it was signed into existence. Aimed to clear up a 3-year-old class action suit accusing Google of copyright infringement, the terms of the agreement go beyond merely settling the accusations, setting the stage for Google Book Search to become the biggest library in the world. It cedes to Google the digital rights to all “orphan books,” any book still copyrighted but out-of-print, without a publisher or an author claiming royalties. Millions upon millions of these books can be found in university and national libraries throughout the world. Furthermore, the agreement permits Google to continue to digitize copyright-protected books on the condition that they charge for access and give 63% of the revenue generated to the copyright holders, represented by a new organization that the settlement creates, the “Book Rights Registry.”No one seems too satisfied with this. Harvard Professor of History and Director of the Harvard University Library Robert Darnton has some serious problems with it, because he believes that commercial interests will pervert what could have been a great public good: a freely accessed database containing all of the world’s knowledge. Numerous authors have voiced dissatisfaction with the terms, believing the $125 million that Google paid them in the settlement to make amends for copyright infringement and the future revenue sharing agreement is unfair and that the license-by-default (authors have to opt out by May 2010 to not be included in the database) is illegal. Consumer Watchdog and Internet Archives have both filed suits objecting to the settlement based upon antitrust law.However, amidst all the uproar, and the settlement’s 134 pages of legalese, a real issue has been ignored. No one has questioned the good of the digital library. The worry is that a commercial digital database will ultimately be damaging. However, history has shown that even a freely accessed digital library would not be what we want.Throughout history, storehouses of knowledge have never managed to be unadulterated houses of knowledge. Ulterior motives have always lurked amidst the stacks. France’s Bibliothèque Nationale served to consolidate the rule of the people during the French Revolution, asserting the power of the masses by, in the name of knowledge, seizing all of the private collections of the First and Second Estates. What has been considered the first public library, the library of San Marco, founded by Cosimo de’ Medici in 1444, was created as power publicity, as a means of instituting the Medici’s dominance in Florence. Even the Library of Alexandria was not born out of benevolence. Ptolemy Soter starved out Athens until it relinquished its knowledge to his desires to build the greatest library ever, a repository of humanity’s cultural production that would endow his Alexandria with the wisdom of the world. While scholars from throughout the world were allowed to come and study at the library, texts were not to be shared with other countries. The Ptolemies banned the exportation of papyrus and confiscated many a scroll from Alexandria’s visitors. Why should the fact of power melt away now, just because we’ve changed mediums from the physical to the digital?Power relations are implicated in any library, when knowledge is concentrated under the auspices of any single force. Google Book Search really does not change the game. It merely translates the outdated paradigm of musty tomes and card catalogs to the internet age. The library we want is not a public library funded by the government or a benevolent nonprofit, but rather a decentralized network of peer-to-peer sharing, with works freely copied, perhaps even illegally copied. So file your objections, bibliophiles! For the sake of libraries, for the sake of books, for freedom’s sake.—Staff Writer Sanders I. Bernstein can be reached at sbernst@fas.harvard.edu

When Michael Scott (Steve Carrel) of “The Office” talks about paper with that little twinkle in his eye, I admit I get a little choked up. Like Michael, I have an affinity for paper, and I love to hold it in my hands. That’s what she said.Recently though, I was on the website for Amazon’s “Kindle 2,” and what I saw caused concern in my paper-loving heart. The Kindle is essentially the iPod of books, allowing users to download a wide range of literature and magazines wirelessly—you’ll never need to hold a wonderful, lovable book ever again. Perhaps for techies and Green People, this is a great leap forward for the absurd idea of “paperless paper,” but for all of us who venerate the real thing, the Kindle is just another injury in a long list. As I watched the instructional video on Amazon, they progressed through the gamut of its features in Steve Jobs-like fashion, and all was going well until they reached the part about the screen. The voice-over claimed that “Kindle’s electronic-ink display reads like real paper,” while “Advanced Paper DISPLAY” ran across the screen and the Kindle displayed a grayscale picture of a woman who didn’t look quite human. After millions of dollars and years of research, the Kindle is an almost-believable approximation of tree pulp. Of course, one of the immediate implications of something like the Kindle is that it is comparatively tree-friendlier than books. You might even be able to consider the Kindle as Green Technology—if you ignore the environmental costs of manufacturing it as well as the quality of life of the underpaid Chinese laborers who assemble it. Perhaps books are old-fashioned, but at least they biodegrade. Can you put Kindles in the compost heap?All its technology and environmental politics aside though, the Kindle bothers me most because it ruins the organic experience of reading. To those who might celebrate the Greenness of the Kindle, I say: I don’t care. I don’t care that it saves trees—because a lot more die from advertising, napkins, and the farming techniques of South America. I don’t care that the Kindle’s carbon footprint is less than the thousand books I can fit inside it. I don’t care that it reads like a real book—because I still like real books. I don’t even care that it’s convenient and easy to carry. That sounds like a sales pitch for a handgun.As part of the Kindle’s advertising, Amazon, without a hint of irony, had Toni Morrison talk about why she likes it. At one point during the three minute clip, the Nobel Prize winning author says, “When you are interactive with a book, that’s what you do, you own it, you can mark it, you can quarrel with it, you can say it’s wrong, you can be overwhelmed by its language or its clarity.” Somehow Morrison connects this idea with the Kindle’s capabilities, though for me, it is those very qualities of a real book that this piece of technology could never capture.Real books have a physical presence that we have to hold and with which we sometimes grapple or “quarrel.” They have a distinctive smell, and picking an old book off the shelf, you can find notes and underlinings from when you first read it. As your understanding of literature and the world grows, your books mature with you. Yes, the Kindle has an auto-scroll feature, but it’s not going to help the words leap off the page. If anything, they just become flat and confined on the “no-glare” screen.The Kindle is part of a trend that has contributed to the decline of the art of paper over the last twenty years. With the development of the internet, newspapers and magazines have been left gasping on the deck of popular irrelevancy—even the New York Times, the Holiest of Dailies. Letter writing has gone the way of the radio. What was, until recently, the modus operandi for distant artistic and scholarly discourse is now mostly used by children sending letters to Santa. The mailbox has become the phone bill or catalogue box. Now that we have a multitude of online communication outlets, what will happen to the love letter (thank you “Sex and the City Movie”)? Now that we have Evite and Paperless Post, what will happen to attractive handwriting? Maybe someday we can read (from our Kindles) “The Collected emails, Myspace comments, Tweets, and online message board comments of Some Famous Author.”For those still holding out on me, here’s one last thing to think about: You’re sitting with your Kindle in a forest that you might have saved by buying your Kindle. You are near the end of a classic with a surprising ending—say Hemingway’s “A Farwell to Arms”—and just before the best (or, in this case, the worst) part, your Kindle’s battery dies! You are miles away from any electricity, and the only thing going through your head is, “I wish I had a book with me.”As a functional tool or toy, I don’t mind the Kindle, but we must never conflate it with the experience of real paper. I hope we refuse to let books become expensive antiques. I hope libraries are always sacred places of knowledge and learning, rather than massively inefficient time capsules. As a side note, if you’re looking to buy a Kindle as a gift, buy it now because it will definitely be sold out around Christmas time.—Staff writer Andrew F.

Carl Ehrlich ’09 has been eating the same burger almost every night for the past four years: a double cheeseburger with pickles, two packets of mustard and two packets of ketchup. Erhlich, captain of Harvard’s football team, a blogger for Go Crimson, and an aspirant novelist with a secondary in philosophy, was also the winner of b. good’s Cousin Oliver contest. He, in other words, is entitled to free burgers from the Dunster Street joint for the rest of his life.Four years ago, when Ehrlich was a freshman, b. good offered a lifetime supply of burgers to whoever best demonstrated that he or she would make the ideal “cousin” to the newest patty place in the Square. Ehrlich and his roommates, hanging out in their Wigglesworth common room, jokingly compiled a list of eight reasons why Ehrlich should win—“4. My blatant lack of a love life will make me a better cousin. Don’t you worry about me missing any meals because of me going on a date or studying with some girl. They hate me. I love Burgers. Period.” Ehrlich figured he might as well send in the entry, so he typed up the application and emailed it off. Four days later, b. good called to tell Ehrlich that he’d won.“Winning the burger thing might have been the highlight of my freshman year,” Ehrlich says. “I went there every. waking. second.” He swore to the Crimson reporter covering his burger bonanza that he’d eat 1,000 by the time he left Harvard.Four years later, Ehrlich is getting ready to graduate and, by my calculations, he’s made good on his promise. After hundreds of burgers (despite a few periods of b. good breaks), Ehrlich has gotten the routine down to a science. He has a set beverage: diet Coke topped off with real soda to trick his tongue. He has a set drink to napkin to burger ratio: “I’m a two to one or three to one drink to burger guy,” he says, laughing. His laugh is half giggle, half husky football player chuckle. And he has a set condiment routine: “I take the mustard, and I move from left to right, up and down like this,” he motions on the table, “ and make little, you know, sinusoidal curves. Then I take the ketchup, and I start at the same point I started the mustard, and I do the complete inverse. And then I turn it 90 degrees and I do the same thing.” He chuckles, “It just happened one day, and it occurred to me that it was perfect.”But winning an unlimited supply of his favorite food wasn’t entirely the unequivocal boon it seemed it would be freshman year. Ehrlich became defined by his burgers. “People were just so fixated on it that I’d go into parties and people would be like, ‘I don’t know you, but are you the burger guy?’ I just didn’t know if that was how I wanted to be known.”Ehrlich has fought this encroachment of burger-as-identity. “Half my time here at Harvard has been spent trying to transcend this idea of me as a burger guy... I’m not just the burger guy.”He has become captain of the football team and has discovered a second academic life in philosophy. He segues from talking about burgers to talking about moral theory and Kantian second-order thoughts seamlessly. He tells me about the scenes and jottings in his moleskine. He is as obsessed with David Foster Wallace as I am, and plans to read Infinite Jest and DeLillo’s Underworld this summer. “You just gotta do it big,” he says. Ehrlich stops and thinks. He takes off he glasses, rubs his face, and laughs. “Winning it was good. It’ll push you to do more things in college if you’re always running away from whatever you’re defined as.”Isn’t this, to some degree, what we all do? We come in as freshman, undefined and searching for a passion to anchor us. We attach to that hook when we find it—the IOP, the Literature department, The Crimson—and we form our identities within and around it. But as soon as we become it, we fight desperately not to pigeonholed by it. I don’t mean to chalk everything Ehrlich did up to avoiding his burger-guy identity, but I still can’t help but see the story of Ehrlich’s relationship to b. good as a metonymy for everyone’s four-year trajectory at Harvard.We’re both hungry by this point, so, we of course, head to b. good. There are no balloons and streamers (the little games with the clerks ended a long time ago). Cashier: “Hello.” Ehrlich: “Hey, how you doing? A double cheese, please?” Cashier: “With pickles, yea?” Ehrlich gets his diet soda, stocks up on napkins and condiments while I look at the plaque on the wall of him. We take our burgers outside to finish our chat while we eat.He unfolds the wrapping on the burger, takes off the top bun, and applies the mustard and ketchup in the sine waves just like he had demonstrated. We chat between bites about hyper self-awareness and grueling football practice.“You know,” he says, “I’ve always been weary of being a regular somewhere or having a regular. I think it’s the mark of a stagnant life. But I’m willing to be a regular at b. good.” He chuckles and wipes his mouth with napkin two of three. —Columnist Rebecca A.

In a surprising case of immigration policy affecting Harvard, Nur Munir, a candidate for a master’s degree at the Harvard Divinity School, is now in York County Prison in Pennsylvania awaiting deportation. After facilitating the downfall of Indonesian President Suharto in 1998, Munir feared persecution from Suharto’s military supporters and fled to America.  However, his application for asylum was denied, appealed, and finally denied again on March 18, 2009, by the Third Circuit.  Regardless of the validity of his asylum claims—Munir was found to have credible subjective but not objective fears of persecution—it is unreasonable that Munir be forced to leave America and family before finishing his studies. Munir has applied for deferred action  so that he can finish his degree at Harvard, and this is where the University can play an important role in protecting one of its students from deportation. Harvard has one of the strongest support networks for international students. But the Harvard International Office—supposedly dedicated to helping students like Munir navigate the byzantine bureaucracy of the American immigration system—has shown a deplorable lack of involvement in his case.While the HIO bends over backward to ensure that international students have the appropriate visas to join the ranks of Wall Street financiers, it seems to have left this student at the Divinity School in the cold. Munir’s case ought to be just as compelling as that of an international student who needs to file an I-20 extension with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The HIO should use all of its considerable resources, connections, and expertise in immigration law to help Munir. It is ironic that we have a “scholars-at-risk” program and are dedicated to scholarship when we neglect one of our own students who fears persecution.Fellow students have written letters to the immigration service asking for Munir’s release, but an official letter from President Drew G. Faust in conjunction with a concerted effort from the HIO would have a much greater impact for Munir’s case for deferred action. Munir’s immigration officer has discretionary power to delay his deportation, and a strong show of support from Harvard would likely have an impact on his decision.Munir’s case also raises questions about the transparency and efficiency of the United States Department of Homeland Security. He was detained shortly after his final appeal was rejected on March 18, 2009, and his classmates and professors were baffled by his disappearance until Professor Baber Johansen, acting director of the Harvard Law School Islamic Legal Studies Program, found out where his student was from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a few weeks later. It is surprising that this student, clearly not a criminal, is in prison at all; he joins the 32,000 non-citizens (including children) who are in prison as their immigration fate is decided. It is imperative that the University push the ICE to release Munir as soon as possible so he can rejoin his family and that he is allowed to remain in the U.S. to complete his studies. Harvard students can help by writing letters to the immigration service. However, the greatest support must come from the Harvard administration itself, which has the power to protect one of its students from a possibly dangerous fate if he is deported.

The Student Events Fund is an outstanding program. It allows students who are on financial aid to buy tickets to campus events that they otherwise could not afford and brings the Harvard community closer together by allowing all a chance to spend time together regardless of financial means. The new SEF website, much simpler to navigate, now makes it even easier for students to participate.
However, one glitch in the process remains—instead of going to the box office like everyone else, students using SEF must visit a separate table at the door of the event to pick up their tickets. While trivial at first sight, this pickup procedure reinforces socioeconomic divisions on campus by singling out some of the poorest students at Harvard.
Who wants to get in a separate line labeled exclusively for students who can’t afford to be in the other line? Receiving financial aid is nothing to be ashamed of, but not all students are comfortable with broadcasting their family’s wealth. If Harvard is going to have a program to help students attend all of the impressive events this community has to offer, then it should do it in a way that keeps students’ financial statuses private. 
There are a number of instances when it would be reasonable for students to want to conceal that they are getting a ticket through SEF. Tickets to some couples events like formals can be purchased through the program, for example. To have to leave one’s date to go to the SEF table while everyone else is flashing their tickets to enter creates an awkward situation for everyone involved. A similar situation occurs when someone attends an event with a group of friends. While all their pals wait in the main line, they must make their way over to the SEF table to get the ticket they could not afford to buy, setting them apart from the group.
I have spoken to many people who find this humiliating, comparing it to a walk of shame. But, faced with the prices of these events, they must continue to rely on SEF’s services. The stigma created by the current set-up works against SEF’s goals to even the playing field; a student’s financial means are a private and confidential matter, and the SEF should keep them that way. 
Luckily, the problem seems to be easily fixable. Students should be given the option to pick up their tickets at the box office in the Holyoke Center instead of at the SEF table. This way, the SEF ticket would be a private matter. Students would simply go to the box office, display their SEF credentials, and receive their ticket. At the door of the actual event, they would be welcomed in just like everyone else.  
Some may argue that the SEF table is necessary to ensure that Harvard students actually attend the events that SEF is financing. Understandably, the organization has a real interest in making sure they are not funding unused tickets. But there are more subtle ways of doing this. One possible work-around would be to have students hold onto a program, sign it, and turn it into the SEF Office. Other ways to prove attendance at an event are also possible. The objection is merely logistical and should not outweigh the feelings some have when they are singled out in front of their peers. 
Once again, SEF is a wonderful program that immensely improves the college experience of many financial-aid students. This suggestion is merely intended to smooth a kink that exists in the SEF procedure. With a simple fix, I think it is possible for everyone to win.

Harvard University, one of the world’s most prestigious educational institutions, is refusing to take an active stance on one of the most glaring educational injustices of our time. Last month, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act was reintroduced into Congress, but Harvard has yet to lift a finger to help get the legislation passed.
This is especially disrespectful to fellow students who would benefit from the DREAM Act. In 2006, there were at least 10 unauthorized migrant youth at Harvard College. I personally know of at least half a dozen. Unauthorized youth are the most visceral representation of what is wrong with contemporary migration policy in the United States. For anyone familiar with this aspect of the migration debate, the stories of unauthorized youth are ubiquitous: 65,000 unauthorized youth graduate from our high schools every year. They are brought to this country at a young age; some arrive before they can even remember living anywhere else. The struggle of unauthorized youth is unique in U.S. history. They are fighting for the basic right to exist in the only country they know as their home. It frustrates me that Harvard isn’t doing more to help them.
As unauthorized youth grow up, they slowly begin to comprehend how unjust the world is for those who are born without citizenship from a privileged nation. Throughout elementary, middle, and high school, unauthorized youth sit in the same classrooms as U.S. citizens do, but they are barred from meaningful employment ,and it’s almost impossible for them to attend college. Regardless of how talented these students may be, their options are limited after they graduate. There is no viable way for unauthorized youth to secure legal immigration status. It is easier for unauthorized youth to get into Harvard than it is for them to get a green card. Their choices are either to go “back” to a country they do not know or resign themselves to life as an “illegal.” 
Every day, I am inspired by the courage of the numerous unauthorized youth who choose neither path. Instead, they choose to forge their own path by advocating for legislation like the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act would grant legal status to unauthorized youth who arrive in the United States before the age of 16 and meet strict requirements: In order to receive a green card, they would have to complete two years of college or two years of service in the military. 
Harvard can be both a refuge and a prison for unauthorized youth. Harvard is a refuge because of its generous financial-aid policies, which allow many students from modest socioeconomic backgrounds to attend. But Harvard is also a prison because it can be an isolating place, especially for unauthorized youth. Unauthorized youth at Harvard are unable to work, travel, or plan for their future. Their lives are shrouded in constant fear. One student, whom I will not name, described ripping his name off the front of his freshman dorm room for fear it would make it easier for Immigration and Customs Enforcement  to find him. 
Worst of all is the stigma associated with being an “illegal alien.” Nick S. Lopez ’10 describes the bittersweet experience of getting into Harvard as an unauthorized youth. “Getting into Harvard wasn’t the happy ending to my story that it should have been. All of these years I’ve felt like a liar because I haven’t been able to tell my friends about my immigration status, either out of fear or embarrassment. There is a stigma associated with being ‘illegal’ in this country, especially with all of the attacks on immigrants by the U.S. government. All I can do is have faith in God and move forward with my head held high. I didn’t come to this country to take anyone’s place. What I have achieved, and what I will achieve, is due to the support of others and my own will to succeed.” Today, Lopez is one of the lucky few to have received a green card—but he still courageously fights for those left behind.
When I asked for a statement from Harvard University about what it was doing for the DREAM Act, University spokesman Joe Wrinn sent me the following: “Harvard supports the efforts of our national associations, such as [the Association for American Universities] AAU and [the American Council on Education] ACE who have worked along with student organizations, in support of provisions in various versions of the DREAM Act of importance to higher education.” Talk about passing the buck: From what I can tell, the last action these organizations took for the DREAM Act was a letter they drafted in 2007. And they have done nothing to support the reintroduction of the DREAM Act this year. 
For Harvard to feign support through organizations that are currently doing nothing for the DREAM Act is not only dishonest, but it is also an insult to the unauthorized youth that Harvard has chosen to educate. To educate youth without fighting for their right to exist in the only country they know as their home is disgraceful. Our fellow students are living every day on this campus in fear, and the DREAM Act is the only chance they have at freedom. Before the end of this semester, President Drew Faust should voice public support for the DREAM Act and pledge to use any means necessary to get the DREAM Act passed.

Kyle A. De Beausset ’08-’11, a Crimson editorial writer, is a religion concentrator who is affiliated with Leverett House. He is a member of Harvard Act on a Dream, which will be holding a rally in front of the Science Center at noon today to ask President Drew Faust to support the DREAM Act.

Inequalities in American public schools indicate one of our nation’s greatest failings. The massively disparate educational opportunities available to children based on the socioeconomic status of their families is a tragedy so familiar and ingrained that talk of it risks seeming banal, and the fact that educational inequality falls largely down racial lines further perpetuates the sordid history of race in the United States. To say that the achievement gap is a persistent and consistent record of misunderstanding and prejudice is an understatement.Beyond the familiar story of educational inequality in the United States, however, lies an additional, suppressed narrative. Although the media have paid much attention to the problems inherent to American public education since the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, the public eye has been largely turned on the difficulties and injustices plaguing the country’s underfunded urban school districts. Rural public education, however, poses its own unique set of challenges—and, at the risk of sounding trite, opportunities. In just over three months, I’ll begin teaching in the Mississippi Delta, and even attempting to imagine what my “experience” will be seems reductive and simplistic. While we recognize the complexities of urban life, it is tempting to incorrectly essentialize and romanticize the American “rural experience.”Nevertheless, it is possible (even for an underexposed product of suburban schools such as myself) to comprehend some of the common implications of shared issues facing rural schools. The number of children in American public rural schools is not insignificant: According to a 2007 study presented by the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2003-2004, more than half of all U.S. public-school districts were rural, and these districts educated one-fifth of all public-school students. The resources available to rural populations shape education in rural areas: in 2004, children in rural schools were less likely to have parents who had completed some form of post-secondary education than children in other areas.The 2007 study reported that, in 2002-2003, a mere 69 percent of rural, public -high-school students attended schools offering Advanced Placement courses, compared to 93 percent of public-high-school students in cities and 96 percent in suburbs. Rural public schools historically have also had fewer instructional computers with Internet access per capita and lower-paid teachers (even after adjusting for the lower cost of living in rural areas). On the other hand, expenditures per student have tended to be higher, and student-teacher ratios lower, in rural areas compared to cities and suburbs. Like elsewhere in the United States, rural public education is failing its students, but perhaps less so. On the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress reading assessment, only a third of 12th-grade public-school students in rural areas scored at or above proficient, consistent with the national average. Rural dropout rates are higher than in the suburbs and lower than in cities.On one hand, the success of public education in any setting is largely the result of quantitative factors that influence schools across regions. Discrepancies in these values manifest themselves in educational inequalities and, over time, have contributed largely to the achievement gap the United States struggles to overcome today. Yet less tangible factors also fundamentally determine the trajectory of a child’s education and a school’s ability to provide effective and comprehensive instruction. These components differ significantly in rural and urban environments in both their nature and the unique challenges and opportunities they present: Ignoring these differences results in profound disadvantages for children educated in rural public schools.Under No Child Left Behind’s “highly qualified teacher” provision, a teacher is considered highly qualified if he or she holds a bachelor’s degree and a teaching license and demonstrates knowledge in every subject in which he or she teaches. While no rational person could disagree with the fact that all children deserve to be taught by “highly qualified” professionals, the supposed uncontroversial nature of the provision is undercut by the difficulty of evaluating intangible factors that determine whether a teacher is highly qualified.The neutrality of the provision’s assumptions “are especially problematic in rural schools,” Karen Eppley argues in the 2009 Journal of Research in Rural Education. While logistical challenges of rural schooling make the provision problematic in rural areas to begin with, Eppley argues that greater issues result from external, homogenous determinations of teacher quality. A teacher who is highly qualified to teach in Chicago, for example, might lack sensitivity to issues facing rural children, rendering him qualified on paper but not in action. Since rural students form the minority, the provision deprives rural communities of the opportunity to define teacher quality in a rural framework.This question is just one of many that characterize the problematic relationship between rural, suburban, and urban schools in terms of policy and public perception of a national crisis in education. In evaluating the current state of education in the United States and moving forward with teacher, student, and school accountability, it is crucial that policymakers and the public recognize the unique obstacles posed by rural and urban environments that hinder American children’s ability to obtain an exceptional education.Emma M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Office of Career Services is an excellent asset for students.  Whether a student is looking for a summer internship, exploring career opportunities, or finding post-graduation employment, OCS has a wealth of readily accessible resources, including brochures, contacts, career counselors, and programs aimed at providing information about a broad range of career opportunities. However, many students will not use any of these resources.  This is because one program, the On-Campus Recruiting Program, overshadows all the rest.  OCR has detrimentally and unnecessarily influenced undergraduates’ conceptions of employment opportunities, and OCS needs to do more to not only present other options but also to make them as easily accessible.
Out of the 1,571 seniors in the Class of 2008, 688 students used OCR, or about 45 percent of the entire class.  These students submitted 15,816 applications in total.  Almost half of the students who applied to jobs using the e-recruiting program accepted job offers, meaning that just over 20 percent of the entire graduating class ended up accepting job offers through OCR.  OCR is unquestionably ubiquitous.  It provides a large number of jobs to undergraduates and attracts many more applicants than there are positions available.  
However, the portal through which students access OCR, Crimson~Experience! (commonly called e-recruiting), can be a source of non-OCR opportunities.  E-recruiting has become synonymous with on-campus interviews, but there are listings for jobs that do not offer on-campus interviews.  Yet this aspect of the e-recruiting process receives little attention because OCR is so widespread.
The problem with OCR is that the scope of available positions is incredibly limited.  While OCS excitedly announces on its website that over 25 different industries were represented in last year’s OCR, it acknowledges that the companies represented are heavily weighted to the consulting and, at least until this year, financial sectors. This is an obvious fact to anyone who has ever used the program.  
There is nothing wrong with applying for jobs in consulting or finance.  These areas often promise highly paid, intellectually stimulating positions and can be good options for individuals who do not yet have a clear direction of where they want to go in their careers. However, OCR makes these options much more salient and gives them much more weight than it ought to; it is comparably much easier to find and apply for these jobs than for jobs that are not listed through OCR or on the e-recruiting website.  
As a friend of mine once noted that, if 1,000 (or even only 688) people run by your window screaming, you are going to go outside and see what all of the commotion is about.  In this way, OCR similarly distracts students from looking at other job opportunities; “everyone” is looking at jobs through OCR, so it is very easy to think that you should be doing so as well.
OCS has done some work, especially this year, to make other opportunities more readily accessible, but more needs to be done.  E-recruiting contains jobs that do not necessarily conduct on-campus interviews, and a first step OCS should take would include advertising these positions and making it clearer that, through the same process and website that OCR uses, students can find an even broader range of jobs.  As a second effort, OCS should make a point of adding more companies to the e-recruiting website even if they do not hold on-campus interviews.  The key is making as broad a range of opportunities as possible accessible from one easy-to-use location.  Finally, while there are several career fair events throughout the year, none receives as much publicity or focus as the major career fair in the fall, roughly corresponding to the time when OCR deadlines in consulting and finance are occurring.  OCS should to more to highlight additional career fairs throughout the year so that other opportunities are as easy to find and as easy to apply for as those through OCR.
This is undoubtedly one of the hardest years for job seekers in recent memory, and, while there are fewer opportunities to be found through OCR, this affords the perfect chance to reexamine the way that students are looking for and finding employment.  By explicitly broadening its focus, by making students aware of other opportunities, and by making it even easier to apply for these opportunities, OCS will further its goal of helping students find the right job.

Even before the effects of last fall’s economic downturn began to impact the nation, the Office of Career Services had launched a new set of programs designed to “turn up the volume on diverse career options.” The new programming was designed to counteract the perception that OCS only offered help for students interested in business careers and featured events covering global public health, human rights and poverty reduction, government, international relations, education, the environment, clean technology, the creative arts, fashion, sports management, journalism, and more.
In September, the newly designed programming created a favorable buzz among students and garnered support and partnerships with many student clubs and organizations. The programs were designed to educate students about pathways, connect them with alumni, and make transparent the different strategies needed to connect to opportunities in disparate career areas.
Soon after the “Turning up the Volume” initiative was underway, the world economy began to “turn down the volume” on employment opportunities. Regrouping, OCS realized new programming was needed to help students learn key strategies for acquiring jobs or internships during more difficult circumstances.  
 Addressing the challenges, OCS added in late fall a four-part series, “Career Prep in a Tough Economy,”  followed by another four-part series added in the spring,“Job-Hunting 101: Real Strategies for Recessionary Times.” OCS also offered two “Job Search Bootcamps” this semester for seniors designed to give the jolt of energy needed to conduct a search in a difficult climate. The program ended with a one-on-one meeting with an OCS advisor, allowing participants to formulate a personalized strategy and determine next steps in their search.
Yet, despite the tumultuous economy, the 2008-2009 recruiting season revealed a great commitment from our employer partners to hire Harvard students. Although recruiting volume was down approximately 10 percent in the fall and another 20 percent in the spring, most employers opted to reduce rather than cancel their recruiting efforts, hired Harvard students for both full-time and internship positions, and plan to hire again in 2009-2010. With strong support from Harvard alumni within their organizations, many employers hope to “protect” entry-level hiring as much as possible.
The majority of organizations and industries use what is referred to as “just-in-time” hiring, meaning that they only hire when there is an actual vacancy, not based on anticipated needs. These kinds of positions are posted and viewable by students on our new online platform, Crimson Careers. Over 150 jobs have been posted in the month of April alone. A word of advice: The best route to both securing a job and job security is having a strong network. Take every opportunity to meet employers and alumni and learn about their fields and career paths. The goal is not to “schmooze” or garner favors, but rather to be a familiar name or face when a position does become available. Similarly, employers will be looking for ways to be visible on campus next year even if they are not going to be hiring. Their hope is that, when they are able to hire, they will still be a familiar name on your list.
OCS has noticed that, despite all the negative news, Harvard students appear to be taking the economic downturn in stride. Students report feeling resilient and optimistic about the new ways the economy will grow after working through this downturn.  They recognize that it will be their generation that forges the new path and generates the innovative ideas necessary for a 21st-century infrastructure to develop. “We are Harvard students,” they say—well educated and positioned to be flexible and open to new ventures. In the past, Harvard students often felt risk-adverse and selected next steps based on what they thought were well-traveled paths with a promise of high income or perceived prestige. While these remain considerations, the changes in the economy and the decline in volume of once-plentiful, high-paying certain types of jobs has empowered students to consider broader options. Teaching, nonprofits, government, health care, clean tech, entrepreneurship, new media, technology, energy, and the environment are changing areas that students are finding themselves intellectually drawn to and where they believe they can make a contribution.
Many students are also exploring other post-graduate opportunities including graduate or professional school, traveling, fellowships, and service-learning. Students are coming to understand that they can cast a wide net to gain skills and experience post-Harvard and that there are may areas where they can add value.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most Harvard students rationalize the exorbitant cost of their education by viewing it as a prudent investment. Armed with bachelors’ degrees branded with Harvard’s prestigious name, many expect careers lucrative enough to exceed the nearly $200,000 spent during their four years in Cambridge. In order to result in a net utility gain and therein to serve as a judicious investment, the benefits of student’s time spent under the Crimson must exceed the costs—both the direct financial cost of attending, pegged at $48,868 for next year, and the indirect opportunity cost of four years that could have been spent working. With tuition continuing to rise faster than the rate of inflation, and no sign of a slowdown in sight, Harvard students should ask the question: how much is their designer degree really worth after their hats are thrown in Tercentenary Theatre?
About to be thrust into a daunting bear market, members of Harvard’s graduating class have doubtless pondered the ultimate meaning of their hard-earned diplomas. For 17-odd years in the classroom, success has been relatively easy to define: Good work is, in theory, awarded with good grades; the higher the grade, the more consummately the student has achieved her task. Quantified through its positioning in an alphabetical hierarchy, academic success is seemingly straightforward. Yet, once we depart from the academic bubble, the only quantitative measure available to translate the abstract concept of success into an intelligible form is money. Rather than engaging in the overwhelming process of defining success on their own terms, a significant number of Harvard students have accepted the easy equation of post-graduation achievement with a six-figure salary. 
With pessimism about the recession reaching Malthusian proportions, the prospect of securing such a salary by landing a coveted consulting job is decidedly slimmer than in recent years. Even graduating students who have managed to finagle their way into finance realize that Wall Street is no longer (and perhaps never was) a stable route to mega-millions. Having dutifully planned out their lives based on assumptions of monetary success in the banking world, graduating students are finding that these assumptions no longer apply and, more often than not, that the banks no longer exist. 
At least Harvard students with quashed financial ambitions can console themselves with immense monetary value of their diplomas—right? The fact that increased education attainment correlates with increased income is indisputable. Two decades of data from the U.S. Census Bureau make manifest this education-income ladder, by which each additional year of schooling (except in the case of graduate school) is associated with additional annual earnings. Although such correlations do not imply causality, the logic that more education means more money lends itself to the logic that a more prestigious education means even more money. According to payscale.com, the median starting salary of emerging Harvard undergraduates who work full-time in the United States is $63,400; even without pursuing further schooling, they boast mid-career median salaries of $124,000. Compare these numbers to the median earnings of the average American male—$45,113 in 2007—and the evidence that a Harvard education increases one’s earning potential appears incontrovertible. 
Numerous studies have arrived at the same conclusion: namely, that it pays to go to selective schools. Harvard economist Caroline Hoxby found that students at elite universities can expect to earn back the difference in cost between the tuition at their first-rank private institution and a third-rank public institution more than 30 times over the course of their careers. Ronald Ehrenberg, a Cornell University economist, also found compelling evidence of a significant economic return to attending a private university: a premium that the data suggests has increased over time.
Yet deducing the high monetary value of a Harvard education from the fact that Harvard graduates make lots of money is problematic. Without sufficient correction for the unique characteristics of Harvard students, the value added by a top-tier education may be drastically overstated. By examining the incomes of adults who were accepted by a highly selective college but who choose to enroll at a less prestigious institution, Princeton economist Alan Krueger attempted to correct for such lurking factors as students’ maturity, motivation, and ambition that result in admission to competitive schools but also correlate with high earnings potential. His finding—that the adults who turned down the offer of elite education earned slightly more than their peers who pursued it—gives credence to the conclusion that Harvard students, not Harvard itself, account for the differences in income. 
The question of whether the $200,000 cost of a Harvard diploma is a prudent investment or a flagrant rip-off remains unresolved. Frustrated investment bankers need not despair—Harvard students enjoy significantly higher earnings than their peers—but the jury is still out on whether we can attribute these high earnings to our alma mater or simply to ourselves. Although Harvard’s educational program makes an ambiguous contribution to the future net worth of its students, a Harvard degree remains a strong predictor of high earnings later in life—yet it cannot guarantee success. Attempts to place a dollar amount on human life offend our moral sensibilities; success, too, is insufficiently captured by the callousness of a quantity. Ultimately, it is the prerogative of each individual to secure success on her own terms, whether they be monetary or otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every winter, juniors who are interested in summer internships in the finance industry can be seen hurrying in suits from interview to information session to yet another interview. E-recruiting makes the process of landing a lucrative financial internship easier, streamlining the process by which interested students find out about and apply for the positions. The same students then generally use e-recruiting their senior fall to apply for full-time jobs at the same list of banks and firms. 
For students uninterested in finance, the path to an internship or job is more uncertain. Though the Office of Career Services has a database with hundreds of jobs that are not in the financial arena, the onus is still mostly on students to learn about opportunities on their own and go through the application process with less guidance than that which e-recruiting provides for its counterparts in finance. Laudably, the college has developed many programs that focus on helping students obtain jobs in alternative careers, such as public service. This new emphasis is in students’ best interests, and the college should continue to expand such programs.
One of the key aspects of e-recruiting is the practice of having on-campus visits for participating companies. Merrill Lynch, Bain and Company, Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital, and the Boston Consulting Group were just some of the financial firms to pay a visit to fair Harvard this winter, and their information sessions were packed with students eager to impress their potential interviewers. Also visiting campus, however, were the Peace Corps, which places volunteers in developing countries to promote growth and peace; Education Services Overseas Ltd., which places American and British teachers in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and South Asia regions; and WorldTeach, which offers students a two-month opportunity to teach English in a developing country. That these service organizations were promoted alongside the more traditional e-recruiting companies merits praise. 
It is understandable that not every public-service organization can afford to participate in processes similar to e-recruiting. In light of this problem, the college can be instrumental in helping students learn about them anyway. The Center for Public Interest Careers at Harvard does just that. CPIC offers students the opportunity to secure internships at a broad spectrum of nonprofit and public-service organizations in many major cities throughout America. Many of the organizations with which CPIC is involved are small, and students would not hear of them otherwise. Last year, 76 Harvard students found summer internships through CPIC, and there is no sign that interest in CPIC’s program is decreasing. 
Another service at Harvard that deserves praise is the Institute of Politics’s Director’s Internship Program. Through the IOP, students can apply for internships in politics or public service, ranging from interning at a congressman’s offices to working for Politico. This year, a record 375 students applied for a Director’s Internship. Students clearly have an interest in working for such organizations, and the opportunities afforded to them by the IOP are commendable.
Beyond merely offering opportunities for students to be employed in the public sector, the college’s emphasis on providing financial incentives for students who choose that career path deserves attention. According to a survey conducted by The Harvard Crimson, two out of every five members of Harvard’s 2008 graduating class headed to a job in business, consulting, or finance. Many of these students were lured to the business world because of the lucrative financial benefits associated with such jobs. Unfortunately, many public-sector jobs require students to sacrifice the opportunity to make a great deal of money. A student with a summer internship at Goldman Sachs, for example, will receive a much higher salary than a student working for his local congressman. Commendably, Harvard has taken great steps to address this inequality. The IOP’s Summer Stipend Program offers a stipend to students working in low- or non-paying summer jobs in government, public interest groups, non-governmental organizations, political organizations, campaigns, and nonprofit groups. In addition, CPIC pays the students for whom it finds employment. Such financial assistance means that students are able to work where they want, and they need not feel they have to take a higher-paying job in which they are less interested. 
Admittedly, due to the far more abundant resources of financial firms, there will probably always be more information at Harvard about jobs in the business world than the public-service arena. Nevertheless, OCS and other programs can still work to both expand their support for and increase their emphasis on non-financial careers. It is imperative that students continue to receive directions from OCS’s office at 54 Dunster Street not only to Wall Street but also to Pennsylvania Avenue and other locations around the world.

Harvard Medical School announced Tuesday that it will launch a program later this month in conjunction with the Portuguese Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education to foster collaborative medical research and education and to develop infrastructure for health information sharing in Portugal. The program, which will involve Portugal’s seven major medical schools and various major biomedical research laboratories, represents the culmination of a two-year planning and discussion process initiated by the Portuguese government, according to Tomas Kirchhausen, an HMS cell biology professor and one of the architects of the program. One major goal of the collaboration is to expand translational research, which aims to apply the findings of basic science investigations to clinical practices and treatments.Kirchhausen, who will serve as HMS Director of the HMS-Portugal Program, said that the new program would be funded entirely by the Portuguese government, although the precise amount has not yet been finalized. “We’re all very interested and excited,” Kirchhausen said. “We’ve received many communications from people at Harvard and hospitals indicating how excited they were and asking how they could participate and collaborate.” The program will last for five years, Kirchhausen said, although he said he hoped funding could be extended further. Plans currently include the creation of research teams composed of Harvard and Portuguese scientists, and opportunities for researchers and professors to travel between the two countries to teach and collaborate. The program may also send a few undergraduates to Portugal each summer to work in labs, and Harvard’s Health Publications Division will help Portuguese health professionals produce and publish medical information for use by researchers and the general public.  In recent years, Harvard and other universities have increasingly funneled resources into promoting translational research. Last summer, the University received a $117.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to found the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center. The center, part of a larger enterprise known as Harvard Catalyst, encourages collaboration among researchers and students throughout the University to understand disease mechanisms and devise new strategies to attack human illness. Bjorn R. Olsen, an HMS cell biology professor and Dean for Research at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine,  said that translational research is, in some ways, the ultimate “goal of medical research.” “There are major diseases that affect not only people in this country but worldwide, and need to be addressed,” Olsen said. “Translational research doesn’t belong to any individual nation—it belongs to mankind—so creating partnerships across national boundaries, across oceans, across disciplines, is very important to get this done.”—Staff writer Peter F.

The bar on the second floor of the Hong Kong restaurant was packed with college students last night, but there were no scorpion bowls in sight. Instead, young people gathered for “College Night with Sam Yoon,” a Kennedy School graduate now running for mayor of Boston.“College students are a vital part of our city, and too often they’re overlooked,” Yoon said. “They’re seen as second class citizens.”In a speech at the event, he appealed to students to join his campaign, offering positions of leadership and the opportunity to learn how campaigns function.The campaign has only collected 700 of the 3,000 signatures needed to put Yoon on the September ballot, where he would compete with four-time incumbent Mayor Thomas M. Menino and fellow councilor Michael Flaherty. Yoon said the remaining signatures would be collected by the end of next week.Currently serving his second term as a Boston city councilor at-large, Yoon is the first Asian American ever to hold that position, and the first to run for any public office in Boston. Despite the historic nature of his campaign, few of the students interviewed were familiar with his platform before yesterday’s event. Attendees, about two thirds of whom were Asian American, were divided over the importance of Yoon’s heritage.“It’s huge,” said Allison J. Rhee, a Northeastern student attending the event. “[His being Asian American] is one of the only reasons we knew his name,” she said. But other students at the event said they were more interested in Yoon’s positions—such as a promise to bring more transparency to Boston government—than his ethnicity.Yoon said he had been prompted to run for the council during an effort to secure land for low-income housing in Chinatown.“I asked myself, ‘what if there had been just one Asian at City Hall or in the State House?’” Yoon said.During his speech, Yoon yielded the floor to Harvard students representing an initiative to bring a temporary storefront library to Chinatown, a neighborhood which has lacked a library since 1956.Weijie Huang ’09, at the Kong to promote the library project, said that although Cambridge residents cannot vote in Boston elections, he thought last night’s event was important because it reached a student population that sends many volunteers to Boston through the Phillips Brooks House Association.Yoon, who moved to Boston in the 1990s, served as housing director for the nonprofit Asian Community Development Corporation before running for office in 2005.—Staff writer Sarah J.

The state economy is still contracting, but an economic index released by the University of Massachusetts projects that the rate of decline is becoming less severe.According to the MassBenchmarks Current Economic Index, the state economy declined at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the first quarter of the year—less than the 4.7 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 2008. The index also forecasted declines of 3.1 percent in the second quarter and 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2009.But despite the encouraging projected trend, economists said that the news was far from positive.“We don’t appear to be in free fall anymore,” said James H. Stock, the chair of Harvard’s economics department, who also helped develop the methodology behind the index a decade ago. “But we’re probably going to see continuing declines in Massachusetts for at least several more months.” In contrast to the figures for Massachusetts, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that gross domestic product in the U.S. shrank at a rate of 6.1 percent in the first quarter, a figure worse than what economists had anticipated.Economists and local officials said they were not surprised that the economy of Massachusetts is contracting at a slower rate than the nation’s as a whole.Harvard economics Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff said that the state was less hard hit by the recession due to the prevalence of biotech, healthcare, and education industries, which are more stable and resilient to the business cycle. But he added that there is still a “serious recession here.” City Councillor Sam Seidel said Cambridge has fared “pretty well” in the recession, and that he hoped the report was the first indication of an upturn in the national economy.In order to foster economic recovery, Seidel said the state government should help the banking industry, make long-term investments in infrastructure, and support people who were negatively impacted by recession through basic social supports.According to MassBenchmarks Co-editor Alan Clayton-Matthews, the current index looks at gross state product, employment, unemployment rate, state withholding taxes, and state sales taxes, while the leading index takes into account consumer confidence and initial unemployment claims, among other indicators.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

The achievement gap in education between white and minority students has not narrowed significantly since 2004, according to data released earlier this week from a national test of 26,000 students that tracks long-term trends in reading and math proficiency.Results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which the National Center for Education Statistics has published every four years since the early 1970s, show that while young minorities have made academic gains, concurrent improvements in the performance of white students have kept the achievement gap consistently wide.Among high-school-age students, that gulf translated to a roughly two to three school-year lag in achievement, according to a U.S. Department of Education official quoted in the New York Times.Despite the persistence of these inequities in academic achievement, “the NAEP results are encouraging news,” said Ronald F. Ferguson, director of Harvard’s Achievement Gap Initiative.  “While the achievement gap has not narrowed much, achievement is rising for everybody, which is important from a national perspective.”“We want to see whites and Asians reach their full academic potential, but we also want to see even more rapid progress among underrepresented minority groups,” Ferguson said. “Our goal should be excellence with equity, but we don’t want to trade excellence for equity. Recent evidence suggests that we’ve made some progress on this long-term journey.”With the reauthorization of the No Child Left Act of 2001—which aimed to close the racial achievement gap—expected later this year, the Obama administration may see an opportunity to alter the way national education policy addresses the achievement gap issue. Ferguson said there is widespread support for transitioning to a model of accountability that measures relative gains in achievement compared to past years rather than relying on the absolute benchmarks currently in use.“It is not just about rules or threatening districts with sanctions for poor performance: it’s about creating opportunities for our [ideal] education principles to go into effect,” Ferguson said. While Cambridge Public School District officials declined to comment specifically on the NAEP results, since staffers had not yet had a chance to review the report, Justin T. Martin, a spokesman for the school district, said he was optimistic about the district’s ability to narrow the achievement gap.“We recognize there’s a lot to do in closing the achievement gap, but we are encouraged by the tremendous involvement of our community in the effort,” he said. Cambridge schools—which has a 64 percent minority enrollment, far higher than the 30.1 percent minority enrollment Massachusetts-wide—has seen 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 10th grade scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System state evaluations increase, according to Martin, who attributed the jumps partly to the district’s increased emphasis on reading and literacy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a town hall meeting two weeks ago, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith tasked staffers and professors with “reshaping” their operations—but with few specifics emerging in the wake of the charge, a confused Faculty is waiting with bated breath for details.At the time, Smith called for broad-based restructuring of FAS, instead of simply shaving costs at the edges, to make up a $220 million deficit over the next two years.“Reshaping starts with the academic activities we’re doing,” said the FAS leader. “We have to prioritize them, decide which ones we want to do, which ones—as worthy as they are—we’ll have to forego in the future.”In an interview last week, Smith said the administration will soon release a communication plan detailing the $77 million of cost-reduction measures to be implemented over the next year. But for now, department leaders have expressed confusion regarding Smith’s call to restructure FAS.“I don’t know what on earth he means [by restructuring],” said English professor W. James Simpson. “Does it mean cutting certain programs? I’m worried that decisions of that kind will be extremely grave decisions that would be very disruptive.”John M. Duffy, chair of the classics department, said he is similarly unsure of the meaning behind the phrase, calling it “a visionary approach without exactly having a clear vision.” Smith may be deliberately withholding details to stimulate discussion among faculty and staff—or Smith himself may simply not have enough details to dispense, Duffy said.“One thing was clear: the Dean doesn’t exactly know himself what this ‘reshaping’ will mean,” said Duffy, who recalled a recent meeting after the town hall in which Smith was unable to provide clarifying answers to questions posed by department chairs.Professors and staff said they are aware that sacrifices will have to be made in any programmatic revamping.“We heard from the floor a number of constituents coming up and saying, ‘You’re not going to cut my part,’” said a professor, who asked to remain anonymous, of the question-and-answer portion of the town hall meeting. “But something’s got to give, and someone’s got to choose.”Anne Harrington, chair of the history of science department, said she finds it unlikely that restructuring will occur at the departmental level because “the unit-analysis is wrong.”“We all hang together,” Harrington said. “If we each reshape ourselves, we’re going to end up a bunch of different-shaped puzzle pieces.”With the administration in discussions about a retirement incentive program for faculty and no indication of increasing the pace of faculty hiring anytime soon, a number of professors expressed concern that restructuring FAS may be a euphemism for shrinking the size of the Faculty.History lecturer Adam G. Beaver, who is also the department’s assistant director of undergraduate studies, said the FAS administration took a “very drastic measure early” by freezing most of its running faculty searches.“The long-term health of the University lies with the long-term strength of its faculty,” said Economics Department Chair James H. Stock. “That requires ongoing hiring and recruiting.”Some professors expressed anxiety that the administration may seek to eliminate faculty positions if the Faculty does not shrink enough through attrition.Smith said in a recent interview that he would not replace retiring professors by default, but rather “take that as an opportunity” to rethink where else he might want to build faculty.English professor Louis Menand said that the administration may discuss the possibility of merging some humanities departments to be able to let go of professors more directly.“The only way you can fire people who are tenured is to close the department,” Menand said.In the meantime, Smith is soon set to appoint six working groups composed of administrators and undergraduates charged with reexamining finances within FAS.Although the working groups will be making recommendations to the FAS administration, they will not have any decision-making power, Smith said. All budgetary decisions will ultimately lie with the divisional deans and with Smith.—Staff writer Bonnie J. Kavoussi can be reached at kavoussi@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Esther I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology held a focus group last spring to discuss a potential new e-mail system, Trevor J. Bakker ’10 had his share of complaints to voice.The current junior says he was so concerned about the limited quota on the existing Faculty of Arts and Sciences Webmail client that when FAS IT announced the creation of a new e-mail service with the domain name @college.harvard.edu in November, he signed up the next day.Since then, Bakker says he has had no problems with the 10-gigabyte mailbox size. And despite one or two minor problems, he calls the @college service “superior” to his old service.But it wasn’t until after he received a message from a technician with a non-Harvard domain name that Bakker realized an outside company was now storing e-mail from Harvard’s new service.While he doesn’t believe that Harvard is selling or distributing his information, he says he had no idea that an outside vendor was involved when he signed up for the @college service.Bakker isn’t alone. The decision to outsource undergraduates’ e-mail—made partly due to cost constraints—was unknown to many students using the service, and the revelation has raised privacy concerns among some, despite assurances from administrators that their correspondence will remain safe.THE SEARCHMail2World is a Los Angeles-based e-mail services company that provides e-mail accounts and capabilities to individuals and institutions. According to Mail2World spokeswoman Carol A. Mason, the company has about 300 corporate and institutional clients that use its servers and services to provide e-mail to their employees and affiliates. Among those clients are other colleges and universities, such as the University of Illinois, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the University of California, Davis.It is Mail2World’s technologies and servers in Orange County, Calif. that FAS IT has chosen for the @college service, according to Noah S. Selsby ’94-’95, senior client technology advisor for FAS IT.The search for an e-mail vendor began last summer, according to Selsby. He says that the decision—a departure from the in-house storage used for FAS Webmail—was made for reasons that ranged from the financial to the technological.“Certainly the economy wasn’t in the state that it was then,” says Selsby, “but there were definitely questions of cost savings. There were definitely questions about ease of management. There are things about outsourcing that make it easier to support in a certain way.”Furthermore, were FAS IT to create a new e-mail client from scratch, Selsby says it would amount to “reinventing the wheel.”“There are people who are dedicated to creating these products,” he says. “Creating one in-house takes a lot of staff time. It’s much, much simpler, and in any case, it’s better to take a product that’s been tested quite thoroughly than it is to do something from the ground-up.”‘SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT PRIVACY’Joshua A. Kroll ’09, a former president of the Harvard Computer Society, says he is none too pleased about the outsourcing of student e-mail to Mail2World.“With any outside vendor, there’s a serious concern about privacy and data ownership,” he says, “which is to say that from a legal perspective and from a Harvard policy perspective, it’s necessary for Harvard to maintain ownership and full control over data even when it’s handled by an external organization.”Kroll, who says he has plans to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science at Princeton next year studying the intersection of security and technology policy, says that any contract between FAS IT and Mail2World would have to ensure that Mail2World does not turn over student data in the case of a legal investigation or a subpoena. But even then, he cautions that there is a risk that Mail2World may not honor the contract.David J. Malan ’99, a lecturer widely known on campus for teaching Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” says he thinks outsourcing e-mail is not a concern. But he adds that students may not know that e-mail sent via the Harvard domain leaves Cambridge.“Outsourcing of e-mail has at least one important implication that students might have to be cognizant of, and that is if they have the expectation that e-mail sent from their college.harvard.edu address to other users within harvard.edu will remain private,” he says.Malan says students need to understand that using an outside vendor means that every message, regardless of sender or destination, will leave Harvard but thinks that educating students about this would be an easy task.Kroll says he believes that not having the e-mail server at Harvard runs the risk of a different type of misconception—the belief that FAS IT is simply unable to manage student e-mail. He says this is false, and that judging from his interactions with members of FAS IT, the technicians wanted to keep e-mail in-house.“A lot of these people don’t want to see the mail outsourced. They want to do it themselves because they feel like they could build something that is better, but they don’t have the funding to do it,” says Kroll. “And it’s not even that the fault is at the top. I think people like [Associate Dean for IT and FAS IT Chief Information Officer] Larry Levine would say that they would prefer not to outsource the mail, but the realities of the budget being what they are, it is the most efficient way to provide services that students are actually likely to use.”In an e-mail, Levine wrote that the decision to outsource e-mail was not based on cost. Rather, the choice of an outside provider was made in order to “provide the best solution” to students.. NO ONE KNEWLike Bakker, Ana I. Mendy ’09 and Yijing Zhang ’11 use the @college service. None of them knew when they signed up that their e-mail was going to be outsourced.But Mendy says she isn’t concerned about the outsourcing because of the way she handles e-mail.“There are certain things that are private, but I wouldn’t use e-mail for that,” she says. “So I don’t really care.”Bakker says he doesn’t have concerns about outsourcing either, but only because he trusts Harvard.Zhang, on the other hand, said that FAS IT should be able to handle and manage their own e-mail client and servers. If they didn’t have a contract, she says that she would be disconcerted about the privacy of her messages.“In terms of my privacy, there are obviously very confidential things that could go through my college account, whether it is my school or my personal e-mail,” she says.A ‘ROCK SOLID’ PROVIDERSelsby calls concerns about privacy “legitimate” but says that measures taken by the Office of General Counsel (OGC) ensure that student privacy is maintained.“There is a very strong contract which OGC and Mail2World spent months drafting, and it addresses specifically issues of security, issues of ownership of data, issues of FERPA, issues of DMCA notices,” he says, referring to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. “We want to make sure that the experience of the student is the same in terms of the protection they received under our systems in-house. From a legal perspective, we feel that’s rock solid.”The measures that have been taken, according to Selsby, acknowledge that data stored on Mail2World’s servers are Harvard property and prevent Mail2World from mining data, passing it on to other parties, or turning it over to authorities.In response to a follow-up e-mail about whether students who signed up for the @college service knew about Mail2World’s role in managing their e-mail, Selsby wrote that FAS IT has featured Mail2World in literature about @college. He cited a press release issued by FAS IT that called @college “a product of Mail2World” and noted that Mail2World already provides services to the Law School and the Divinity School. Besides these two references and an expression of confidence from Levine, the press release said nothing else about the e-mail vendor.Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor and former dean of the College, says he has confidence in the negotiations that took place and the contract that came out of it.“My sense from knowing what I know and reading the press releases is that the people who negotiated this contract with Mail2World have done an extremely careful job,” Lewis says. “That’s why they went to this company, because they had a track record and they were apparently able to accommodate some of the expectations and demands. I don’t want to unnecessarily alarm people.”Lewis says the fact that Harvard is Mail2World’s client carries greater weight when it comes to maintaining privacy and reliability since a failure to accommodate a prestigious university could discourage other colleges to outsource e-mail services to Mail2World.Mason, the company’s spokeswoman, says that Mail2World has never had a privacy breach. Data such as a user’s name, password, and e-mail messages are given the distinction of “personal private information,” which is protected by a password that, according to Mason, is only known to two people within the company.Mason also says that the servers are protected by multiple layers of redundancy, a backup generator, and a backup server located at their headquarters in Los Angeles. Mail2World is in the middle of constructing a new server in Dallas, but this server will be used to serve new clients, particularly those from Latin America.When asked what she would say to a student who was bothered by the potential privacy risk of e-mail outsourced to Mail2World, Mason says that there is very little to fear.“Well, I would say, ‘Don’t use webmail then,’” she says. “But I could also say that with millions and millions of people using the system from mobile devices or desktops or internet cafes all over the world and the eight years we’ve been in business and millions of happy customers that continue to use that service, I would say that’s a pretty good risk.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One must not only “educate the mind, but also the heart,” the Dalai Lama said yesterday morning to a rapt audience at Memorial Church in a speech entitled, “Educating the Heart.”The Divinity School and the Graduate School of Education co-hosted the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, the spiritual leader of Tibet. After traditional Tibetan dance performances and introductory remarks by Divinity School Dean William A. Graham and School of Education Dean Kathleen McCartney, audience members stood in anticipation as the Dalai Lama entered the hall and proceeded on stage. The Dalai Lama lightened the mood when he began by saying that “the first task is to remove the shoe,” and doing so with a chuckle. He sat cross-legged on the wooden throne, which was specially constructed for the event by local Tibetans. He spoke casually and conversationally to the audience, giving the speech an “intimate feeling,” in the words of Cristina Y. Remond, a first-year student at the Divinity School.Despite his light-hearted and easy-going demeanor, the Dalai Lama’s message was a serious—and uniting—one.“Mentally, emotionally, physically we are the same,” the Dalai Lama said. “Therefore on that level we can communicate easily.”He emphasized infusing education with compassion. “The brain alone will not bring joyfulness or happiness,” the Dalai Lama said, adding that “one must practice love, compassion.”Compassion is common to all religions, he said, stressing interfaith understanding.School of Education spokeswoman Amy Rollins said that the Dalai Lama’s message exemplified the school’s mission statement, “to generate knowledge to improve the life of all learners.”“He frames education as a life goal instead of something that happens for 12 years in school,” she said.Audience members expressed enthusiasm for the Dalai Lama’s ideas. Allyson R. Lent, a first-year student at the Divinity School studying to be ordained in a Unitarian Universalist church, said she wants to spread the Dalai Lama’s message about compassion to her own communities.Daniel M. Dion, a student in his final year studying Catholic theology, said, “I care about inter-religious dialogue, and it’s important to have the possibility of dialogue, especially in my faith.” The Dalai Lama wanted to hear from the students and faculty, according to Rollins, and he took questions from the audience after his speech.When asked whether he has ever doubted his faith, the Dalai Lama replied with a quick “No,” eliciting laughter from the audience.Following the talk, the Dalai Lama proceeded outside for a tree-planting ceremony, where he planted a special hybrid birch tree, created from Eastern and Western birch tree strains by Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum. University President Drew G. Faust also presented him with a commemorative picture to honor his visit.“It’s interesting to see him in a Western setting, and not his native setting,” said Neethi A. Venkateswaran, a Divinity School student in her final year of study.“You can interact with the Dalai Lama in many ways,” said Remond. “You can go into it with thoughts and expectations, or go in completely open, listen with your heart, and allow yourself to be transformed.”—Staff writer Emma R.

Long-time Harvard economics Professor John Y. Campbell will take over as chair of the Department of Economics on July 1—taking the helm in the midst of an economic downturn that has made its mark on the department.Campbell will replace the current chair, economics professor James H. Stock, who has served out his three year term. In his 15th year at the University, Campbell specializes in asset pricing and macroeconomics. Since 2004, he has also served on the board of Harvard Management Company—the organization charged with managing Harvard’s endowment.Campbell spent this academic year on leave, though he remained in Cambridge for most of the year researching housing foreclosures.Campbell’s popular undergraduate offering “Economics 1763: Capital Markets” will be taught by a visiting professor next year in order to lighten the incoming chair’s teaching duties as he assumes his new role.Several members of the economics department interviewed yesterday said they supported Social Sciences Dean Steven M. Kosslyn’s decision to appoint Campbell as chair, which was announced to the department in an e-mail Wednesday.“My sense is that he will be very, very good at the helm, particularly with dealing with difficult problems in a difficult period,” said economics professor Claudia Goldin.As chair, Campbell will inherit a challenge that his predecessor Stock has been wrestling with for much of the year–decreasing budgets while managing a department with one of the lowest student to faculty ratios at Harvard. With the Faculty of Arts and Sciences facing down a $220 million budget deficit over the next two years, economic strain has already caused the department to cancel its junior seminars for next year.“We need to review everything we are doing in light of the tough budget decision that FAS is facing,” Campbell said.Stock said his successor was a “terrific choice” to take the reins. “[Campbell] has a deep understanding of FAS and University finances, he is creative and will bring that strength to bear as we look for constructive solutions to the FAS budget problems,” he said.Campbell said he sees his two main tasks as chair to be “ensuring the vitality of the faculty in a time when resources are tight” and “mak[ing] sure that economics at Harvard is a meaningful intellectual experience and that it isn’t just a set of large impersonal lectures.” But in light of the difficult times, Campbell said that he “take[s] over as chair of a department that I think has been very well run.” “There is no one concrete thing that I think—or that is generally agreed to need—changing,” Campbell said. Campbell, who grew up in England, attended Corpus Christi College at Oxford for his undergraduate years and Yale for his Ph.D. From 1984 to 1994 he taught at Princeton, before coming to Harvard.Campbell also serves on Harvard’s Debt-Asset Management Committee and is a partner at the hedge-fund Arrowstreet Capital, L.P.  Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who was on the hiring committee that chose Campbell in the early 1990s, announced Campbell’s appointment on his blog.“I have long thought that my biggest contribution to Harvard was being part of the team that recruited John to the university,” he wrote on his blog. “I am delighted that the leadership of our department will be in such capable hands over the next few years.”—Staff writer Noah S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A crowd of 150 students cheered on members of the Harvard Boxing Club in nine head-to-head bouts at the Quadrangle Athletic Recreational Center last night in the first boxing exhibition on campus since 1976.
Over 30 years ago, Harvard Boxing was discontinued as an intramural offering and became solely a club sport due to often riotous crowds during House tournaments. 
“This was a big challenge for us,” said Toby “Stormin” L. Norman ’10, co-president of the boxing club. “We’re really excited to bring this tradition back.” 
But the task of reviving Harvard boxing—once required of all College students during World War II—was not without its hurdles, including securing the approval of the administration, the Recreational Club Sports program, and University Health Services.
Tim W. Wheaton, assistant director of athletics, Gary J. Brown, manager of recreational sports at the Quadrangle Recreational and Athletic Center, and Claire Goggin, intramurals and clubs sports assistant, were the first on board with the club’s idea to host an exhibition. 
“The department is excited to give student athletes an opportunity to exhibit their skills. Harvard has 38 clubs, with an opportunity for all clubs to give,” Brown said. 
Several students interviewed by The Crimson said they felt that the major argument against the exhibition was the image of a lack of safety that boxing portrays.
“People tend to have a negative view of boxing,” said Jonathan K. Nguyen ’09, the club’s other co-president. “But this is Olympic amateur-style boxing. And amateur is a different style.”
In amateur boxing, fighters wear head protection and bouts are much shorter than in professional boxing. The emphasis in the sport is on scoring points, rather than knocking one’s opponent out, and organizers stressed the relative safety of the event. 
Still, Patty M. Yoffe—wife of club coach Doug A. Yoffe and recent recipient of the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians’ Ringside Physician of the Year award—was on-site to tend to participants’ safety.
Despite the initial organizing difficulties, the event came together successfully in the eyes of organizers. 
“Everyone worked so hard during the year being able to perform in front of a crowd is an exciting prospect,” said Doug Yoffe. “People admire them for their courage or determination whether they’re a man or a woman.”
Maria A. May, a member of the club, spoke of the strength and support that club members provide for one another, regardless of gender.
“I’ve played for a lot of sports, and I’ve found this team aspect very strong, supportive, and inclusive,” said May, who is a case writer at Harvard Medical School. 
“It’s been one of the best social experiences that I’ve encountered on campus, and it’s good that a lot of people showed up in support,” she said.

Good morning, weary traveler.  Guess what happened while you were sleeping?  Well, it pretends when you went to bed, but anyway there was a "probable" case of swine flu announced out of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.   The Dental School.  Thanks a lot, Dental School.  Thanks for being the first to bring the swine killer our way.
At this point, you know all about swine flu. Perhaps you are keeping your distance from pork chops or vigorously washing your hands at this moment. From its place in relative health obscurity, falling somewhere between scabies and Tourette’s syndrome, swine flu has launched itself into germ infamy.The outbreak has affected thousands in Mexico and well over 100 and counting in the US.  And now maybe the Dental School.
You can't say we weren't prepared for this.  Harvard University Health Services sent out a helpful email informing the Harvard community about how to avoid contracting the virus.  Insightful advice about washing hands (with soap, people!), avoiding contact with the sick, and how to cough properly (“into the crook of your elbow”) from HUHS has been much appreciated by FlyBy, who had previously thought that sneezing into people’s faces and swapping saliva with those who had hacking coughs was healthy and downright sexy. So, in order to better inform the Harvard community on how to proceed in this time of pandemic confusion, FlyBy has figured out a simple and effective form of swine flu deterrence.  We've got your back.
Find out what it is after the jump.
Gas masks!
Gas masks would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of germs. Gas masks cover the entire face, so no need to worry about touching eyes, nose, or mouth. They also make it difficult, in many ways, to hit on sick people, so no need to worry about getting dirty germs. And think of all that time you’ll save from not touching your face and not touching other people to wash your hands with soap! Genius idea, we know, but now how can you proceed in getting this necessary, life-saving object you wonder? FlyBy has taken the liberty to find local businesses that could help.
1) Lush: With so many soaps of all scents available, Lush on JFK St would seem like an ideal place for taking the next step in fighting swine flu and selling the highly marketable gas mask. But upon inquiry, FlyBy was told that Lush indeed did not sell gas masks but did “have a wide selection of facemasks.” How delusional, as if an apricot exfoliating face mask would really help.
2) Dickson Bros: Although this hardware store carries some wimpy dust masks, it was lacking on the heavy-duty gas masks. Butthey do carry the "respiratory mask," which may just have to do.
3) Hong Kong: Surprisingly, the Kong also does not carry gas masks, although patrons often report the desire to have one when they see the Scorpion Bowl.
Conclusion: The dearth of the gas mask industry in the Square is not only surprising, but also just wrong. Without this useful--not to mention fashionable--piece of safety equipment, Harvardians are continually exposed to a myriad of deadly diseases. And yet, when asked if he would wear a gas mask to avoid swine flu, one freshman said, “I’ll take my chances.” The ignorance towards gas masks will have consquences. Don’t come crying to FlyBy when you get that cough, we will be safe and sound behind our gas masks.

Been creeped out over the past few weeks by carrot-wielding, overly paranoid people stalking hallways for unsuspecting targets? Yeah, FlyBy is also ready for this round of Assassins to come to an end.  Thankfully, that day is approaching. But we also see the appeal of a long-sought excuse for your paranoia and excessive facebook stalking.  Don't worry, FlyBy doesn't judge.
In true Harvard fashion of over-intensity, this round of Assassins brought out the best in Harvard students—a bizarre combination of creepiness and mis-directed ingenuity. And FlyBy has your rundown of some of the more outrageous kills, characters, and shoot-outs—after the jump.
Quincy: The people's house organized competitors into various teams, with The Professionals taking home the prize.  According to one participant this game quickly devolved into what resembled a Western shoot-out—lots of shots fired with almost none hitting their targets.  But then again, since when were Harvard students known for their marksmanship?
One particularly epic shoot-out pitted Ian Malott '09 against Will Hetzler '09.  After realizing that his target was on his way back to his room, Hetzler camped out behind a door at the end of the Quincy hallway armed with a grotesque fully automatic nerf gun.  Hetzler watched through the a crack in the door as his target walked towards him armed only with single shot guns, head swiveling madly to try and spot a possible assailant.  Bursting through the door, Hetzler met Malott with a spray of darts.  But in what  Keller Rinaudo '09, a member of the winning team, described as a "Pulp Fiction moment" all the bullets missed Malott, leaving the two combatants standing shocked in the hallway.  Not bothering to shoot back, Malott turned and ran.  Great marksmanship indeed.  On second thought, does ROTC even want Harvard students?  They can't shoot straight anyway.
Adams: Here at FlyBy, we appreciate our next-door neighbor's generosity in lending their dining hall to the hordes too lazy to make the trek to Quincy.  Adams continued capitalizing on their best asset in their Assassins game, opting for a dining hall theme of spoons as weapons.  FlyBy heard the requirement that the spoon make skin contact in order for a kill to count brought out hoodies and fleeces along with the occasional facemask and gloves. Yeah... told you these people were intense.
Although Joe Poirier '11 took home the crown, FlyBy's favorite kill belongs to Dan Bear '10 who made the trek to Jefferson Science Labs to surprise his victim with an ingenious spoon attack.  Bear tracked his victim to the north end of campus, waiting outside his lab to pounce.  Before he could register a kill against his "well-protected" opponent, Bear had to chase the victim around Jefferson until he finally cornered him and applied the spoon to his face.  That's dedication. But apparently, the frenzied chase garnered a few concerned looks, with more than one staffer under the impression that Bear was actually trying to assault his victim.
"I was surprised that other people weren't going to such lengths," Bear said.  FlyBy salutes this man's downright lackadaisical mindset.
Leverett: Perhaps in an homage to their furry mascot, Leverett House armed participants with not nerf guns, not swords, but carrots!  Yes, carrots.  And how does one avoid assassination in this bucolic match?  Ask and ye shall receive: chewing broccoli.  Yes, broccoli.  So it was no surprise when FlyBy learned that the most intense participants toted around a tupperware container full of broccoli at all times.  FlyBy was less excited to hear about those who declined to find a fresh source of broccoli.  Delicious!
The Leverett House winner, Ben French '10, faced a particularly nasty opponent in a Lev resident who manically carried with him a container of broccoli.  But once the organizers dispensed of the broccoli rule, French's path to victory was clear.  He chased his opponent through the halls of Leverett and dispatched his opponent in a carrot-sword fight.
You can't make this shit up.
Eliot: Although its game of Assassins wrapped during reading period, one Eliot contestant deserves a special mention for creativity, creepiness, and gusto for the fine art of the kill.
Faced with an opponent from his home state of Utah, Kenneth Brewer '11  lured his victim to his chosen killing zone by impersonating as a well-known Harvard alumnus from Utah.  Brewer called his victim posing as the alumnus and asked her to meet him at Herrell's Ice Cream, a location this person frequents.  Arriving early at Herrell's, Brewer watched from a booth as his victim walked to the back of the shop where she awkwardly introduced herself to some other students who she thought was there to meet the same man.  Brewer then crept up behind her and dispatched his victim.  After such a ruthless kill, Brewer apologized and asked if he could buy the girl ice-cream.  She declined and went back to the library. FlyBy is no dating expert but identity theft does not strike us as the best way to get a girl. But Brewer does get the prize for FlyBy's favorite kill.

In this "civilized" day and age, FlyBy just doesn't get enough old-fashioned chances to watch people beat the shit out of each other. So obviously we weren't going to pass up an opportunity to see the first boxing exhibition on campus in decades.  FlyBy took itself down to the QRAC to see the first half of the Harvard Boxing Club's first exhibition in 30 years—one which will hopefully become the annual tradition it is advertised to be.
Knowing little about boxing, we asked club member Michael L. Blumenthal '11 about how the sport is played. Each match has three two-minute rounds with about a minute of rest in between each. Scoring is based on number of blows landed and a couple of other factors. But these matches were not actually scored--instead, each participant walked home with a shiny trophy. Check out the video.

We give serious props to all participants because of the very real bravery it takes to stand up in front of a crowd and flaunt one's fighting skills. But the question still remains, how did our boxers actually stack up in terms of style and prowess? Read the analysis after the jump.
Match 1: Hernan "Hollywood" Gatpandan (red) versus Jonathan "The Hawaiian Punch" Nguyen (blue)
(Note: all nicknames are courtesy of the expedition program and do not represent FlyBy's own limited creativity at work)
Weighing in at exactly 143 pounds each, these two guys provided an excellent example of basic boxing. Nguyen described his fighting style as more of a straight puncher, and the match bore him out. One noteworthy observation--as each punched, a slight "breath" sound could be heard, which according to Nguyen is what happens as as boxer tightens up his stomach muscles to better handle the blows. At one point a spectator could be heard calling, "Haran, you're so sexy!" from the audience.  Nguyen left the second round with a bloody nose but seemed upbeat about his performance.
Match 2: Dan "Lockbox" Lorenzana (blue) versus Iurie "Bearclaw" Boreico (red)
This was a much more feisty match than the first. Rather than straight jabs, both individuals favored sweeping side hooks. As opposed to the first match, where the opponents kept a reasonable distance, these guys were pretty much all up in each others' faces during the competition. According to an injured (and thus sidelined) female boxer, Lorenzana had more experience, but Boreico could handle any punch. It showed: though Lorenzana seemed to land more blows, Boreico was not fazed  and powered through the entire match.
Match 3: Luyi "Louie Louie" Zhao (red) versus Toby "Stormin" Norman (blue)
These guys were a bit more meticulous about warding off blows than the previous pair--Norman especially was incredibly agile and ran Zhao all over the ring to evade being hit, while simultaneously landing straightforward yet stylish punches. Norman also seemed to have a fanclub, conveniently located in the first row, carrying signs with slogans such as "The sun never sets on his biceps."
Match 5: THE GIRLS, AKA Maria "The PUN-isher" May (blue) versus Eleanor "The Viking" Wilking (red)
In a huge crowd pleaser, these two ladies faced off as the last match of the first half. Lots of head blows noted.
At the end of the day, besides one nosebleed and some random blood spatters there were no visible injuries. According to Toby Norman, "These are your teammates so you don't want to kill each other."
