After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow earned $1.13 million in 2020, a pay cut from his compensation during the first full year of his presidency in 2019.
The earnings of Harvard’s highest-paid administrators and faculty were disclosed on Friday in the University’s annual Form 990 tax filings, which the Internal Revenue Service requires of all tax-exempt entities.
Bacow’s total earnings consisted of $888,371 in base salary, $184,512 in nontaxable benefits, $35,865 in deferred compensation, and $24,194 in other reportable compensation. Bacow’s nontaxable benefits include his housing at Elmwood, the University president’s residence.
Other top administrators at the University also took a pay cut: University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 earned $825,670 in total compensation, compared to $955,759 in 2019. Outgoing Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who is set to depart Harvard this summer, made $770,423, compared to $812,012 in 2019.
Bacow, Garber, and Lapp took 25 percent pay cuts in April 2020 as part of the school’s efforts to reduce spending in the early days of the pandemic. The pay cut was only in effect for the final eight months of the year. Other senior administrators were given the option of reducing their salaries or contributing to an employee support fund.
During her second full year as dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Claudine Gay earned $824,068 in 2020 — up from the $783,399 reported for 2019. Gay's total compensation jumped up in 2020 as a result of her housing, not a salary increase. Her housing was unavailable for four months in 2019 due to renovations.
David J. Malan ’99, who teaches the popular introductory course Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” earned $1.4 million — more than any other current member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Top officials at Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard’s $53.2 billion endowment, earned millions more than the University’s top administrators, consistent with past trends. The two entities file taxes separately.
Two of HMC’s officials — Chief Executive Officer N.P. “Narv” Narvekar and Chief Investment Officer Richard W. Slocum — deferred millions of dollars in compensation to future years in 2020, according to a press release from the company.
Narvekar, who has led HMC since December 2016, earned just over $1 million in total compensation — but he deferred more than $5 million to future years. Adjusted for the deferral, Narvekar earned $6.24 million — on par with his compensation in 2019.
Slocum earned $866,000 in total compensation, deferring more than $4 million.
HMC Chief Operating Officer Sanjeev Daga also earned more than $6 million, including more than $1 million in reimbursements he received for lost compensation resulting from his departure from Columbia University’s Investment Management Company in 2018. Not including reimbursements, Daga earned $4.99 million in 2020.
At the University, other top-earning administrators in 2020 included Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee, who earned $828,544, and Vice President and General Counsel Diane E. Lopez, who earned $583,347.
Anne H. Margulies, who served as Harvard’s vice president and chief information officer until her retirement in May 2021, earned about $1 million, including more than $500,000 in deferred compensation. Former Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn M. Hausammann, who also retired last year, earned just shy of $900,000, including more than $450,000 in deferred compensation.
The deans of Harvard Business School and Harvard Medical School earned more than any other deans across the University, consistent with previous years. Former Business School Dean Nitin Nohria — who stepped down in December 2o2o, but still teaches at the school — earned more than $915,000, while HMS Dean George Q. Daley made over $896,000.
The University’s two highest-compensated employees — V. Kasturi Rangan and Lynn S. Paine — were both HBS professors who participated in the school’s voluntary retirement incentive program, which allowed them to receive a lump-sum payment upon retiring at a set date. Rangan made over $2 million from Harvard and related organizations in 2020, while Paine earned $1.9 million.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — a student and alumni group that for years advocated that the University divest its endowment from fossil fuels — released a report last week calling on the school to invest more in environmental causes and local municipal governments and to reform its governing boards.
The report, titled “Whose University? The Case for Reinvestment at Harvard,” comes after Harvard announced in the fall that it would eventually end its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry. In the report, FFDH called on Harvard to “reinvest” its funds in causes “that will repair the harm it has caused in the past,” such as affordable housing and renewable energy.
The report also called on Harvard to make its governing boards more democratic, calling the selection process for the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — “deeply untransparent and undemocratic.”
FFDH organizer Jade O. Woods ’22 said the report was compiled after input from a wide range of Harvard affiliates.
“This has really been a community-driven process,” Woods said. “We, as FFDH, aren’t standing here saying that we know what’s best for Harvard to do with this money. We’re saying that the community has consensus on what it wants.”
Woods said local groups and experts including the Black Response Cambridge and Boston regenerative finance experts filled in “gaps in knowledge.”
FFDH organizers argued that Harvard has failed to invest enough into its surrounding areas. Claire E. Pryor ’23, an organizer for the group who co-wrote the report, said Harvard is “an unbelievably huge gentrifying force.”
The report called on Harvard to invest $1 billion in affordable housing in Cambridge, Allston, and other surrounding municipalities.
Harvard currently participates in an array of affordable housing initiatives, including the All Bright Homeownership Program, a partnership between the University and Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation aimed at increasing home ownership, to which Harvard has contributed around $3 million. In 2019, the University also committed $20 million to the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative, an initiative first launched under a different name in 2000 that aims to increase the affordable housing stock in Cambridge and Boston.
The school has also donated property to affordable housing developments.
Still, some local officials who participated in crafting the report, called on the school to do more to invest in housing.
Cambridge City Council member Quinton Y. Zondervan, who worked with FFDH on its listening tour, wrote in an email that he collaborated with the group in hopes of seeing “clear commitments” from Harvard, including more support for affordable housing.
Ayesha M. Wilson, a member of the Cambridge Public Schools Committee, said she hopes Harvard will reinvest money into public education and providing internships and paid work experiences to young people in Cambridge. She also called on the school to prioritize investments in affordable housing.
The report also said the school should “dramatically increase” payments through the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program — a state program that allows municipalities to request payments from nonprofits whose land is tax-exempt. The payments are optional.
Harvard’s contributions through the program have fallen short of the amount Boston city officials requested each year since 2012.
School officials have pushed back on claims that Harvard doesn’t do enough for its surrounding communities. After a PILOT reform bill was introduced in the Massachusetts state legislature last year that would make the payments mandatory, Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote that the University provides a variety of “programs, initiatives and outreach” to local residents on top of PILOT payments and required municipal taxes.
“These local benefits are an important extension of Harvard’s mission, serve thousands of local residents every year, and reflect years of collaboration between the University, its neighbors, and city partners,” O’Rourke wrote at the time.
The report also took aim at Harvard’s governance structure, calling for the University’s two governing boards — the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers — to be reformed.
It said the Harvard Corporation, which weighs in on most major University decisions, should become democratic.
“Thirteen people in a room somewhere shouldn’t be making decisions for thousands of people’s lives,” Woods said of the Corporation.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the report's criticism of the Corporation.
The report was one of the first major organizing efforts FFDH has launched since the University announced in the fall that it would move to divest its endowment from fossil fuels.
“In the past, when we’ve been organizing for divestment — that’s one clear ask,” Woods said. “And now we have about a dozen new asks that are much more detailed, and explicit. And so I think that our style of organizing will necessarily have to change.”
Correction: May 11, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated a report issued by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard was the group’s first organizing effort since September 2021. In fact, it was involved with several protests in the following months.
