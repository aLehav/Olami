After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most students are just finally getting settled back into life on campus, Harvard athletics is hitting the road. In fact, every in-season team with matchups this weekend is playing outside of Cambridge.
No. 6 men’s soccer is looking to extend its winning streak following last Saturday’s electrifying game against Stanford and a mid-week victory over Massachusetts, as it takes on No. 10 Connecticut in Storrs, Conn. tonight.
Meanwhile, the Crimson women’s soccer team has headed down south to Florida for a pair of weekend games. Harvard dropped the first contest to Central Florida, 3-0, last night in its first loss of the season but will try to bounce back and improve on its 1-1-1 record against South Florida tomorrow.
Crimson men’s water polo and women’s volleyball have also left town for at the Princeton and Fordham Invitationals, respectively. The volleyball team split last night’s two matchups and will face two more opponents today, while water polo will take to the pool for its first game this afternoon. Harvard water polo’s weekend schedule is challenging to say the least, with contests against three nationally-ranked teams, including No. 17 Cal Baptist, No. 18 Princeton, and No. 13 Santa Clara.
Crimson women’s field hockey is also trying to defend its currently unblemished record against Maine and Vermont at the Sheraton Catamount Classic.
Two Harvard squads are also making their season debuts this weekend with sailing at a series of regattas across the Northeast and men’s golf in Princeton, N.J. for a Harvard-Yale-Princeton matchup.
Crimson sports fans looking for a game closer to home may be out of luck for now, but with the year’s first football game against Holy Cross at Harvard Stadium next Saturday night, it may be worth the wait.

New season. New coaches. New shot at the national championship
But the Radcliffe Rugby Football Club is not new to tough competition. After coming one try away from going to Nationals last fall, the squad is entering this year with a definite goal in mind: retribution.
It starts off its season this weekend at the Beantown Tournament in Amherst, Mass. Although Radcliffe plays in Division II during the main season, it will be competing in the Division I bracket for the contest. It is scheduled to play UMass Amherst and Cornell in the first round, two of the best teams in the nation.
“We are really excited to go back out there,” sophomore scrumhalf Kellie Desrochers said. “It is really exciting, because we have a great set of freshmen this year. It’ll be fun to have us all on the field.”
Returning coaches Bryan Hamlin and Shannon Wallace are joined by two additions to the staff. Katie Dowty ’06, a Radcliffe rugby alum, was named Rookie of the Year for the Beantown Rugby Football Club and has attended the US U-23 women’s national camp for two consecutive years. Melanie Denham plays flanker for Beantown and the US national team, with whom she recently competed in the Women’s Rugby World Cup. Dowty and Denham will be providing further guidance to the backs and forwards, respectively, this season.
With its experienced staff and relentless determination, Radcliffe is a team to watch out for in the rugby world this season.
“This weekend is only the beginning,” Desrochers said. “This year, nothing is going to stop us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some valedictorians spend their free time working on their math or Spanish. Harvard freshmen Bonnie Hu and Seiji Liu spend it working on their golf swings, and they’re now at the top of more than just their high school classes. Both were named as Freshmen to Watch by Golfweek Magazine this week, impressive given the men's and women's lists each named only 20 golfers. Only six other schools in the country had freshmen named to both lists.
Hu's arrival will help the already strong women's squad remain an Ivy frontrunner despite the loss of last year's captain, Claire Sheldon '10. Sheldon was a three-time All-Ivy selection and took third overall in the 2009 Ivy League Championships, leading Harvard to its second straight Ancient Eight crown. While Sheldon wasn't able to finish her stellar Crimson career with a three-peat, she helped take Harvard from a team that had never won an Ivy title to a team unfamiliar with losing it.
Sheldon left the team in good hands. Returning to the team are captain Mia Kabasakalis, junior Christine Cho—the Ivy League Player of the Year in 2010 and Rookie of the Year in 2009—and sophomore Katie Sylvan, last spring's Ivy League Rookie of the Year. With Hu joining them on the links, the team seems to have more than enough fuel to make another run for the title in 2011.
Liu, meanwhile, will shoulder much more responsibility in his first season on the men's team, which returns only two of its top finishers. Luckily for the Crimson, those two are juniors Tony Grillo and Mark Pollak. Harvard's top two golfers last year, the pair both placed in the top 10 at the 2010 Ivy Championships.
Due to the departure of top golfers on both teams, the Crimson will have a whole new look on the golf course this year. But when that new look includes two of the best freshmen in the country, change doesn't seem so scary.

Study cards are in, but the hype about Science of the Physical Universe 27: Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science continues. Check out this video about students' experiences shopping for the new course.

You might think some Harvard courses have unusual syllabi. Yes, it is possible to emerge from the Coop with a copy of Goodnight Moon for a Gen Ed course, and there’s also that “science of cooking” class everyone and their grandmother lotteried for (but then didn’t get into). For now, though, it seems that the University of Virginia has taken the cake when it comes to bizarre courses. How, you ask?
Apparently, in Charlottesville, students can take a course called “GaGa for Gaga: Sex, Gender, and Identity,” which—according to The Cavalier Daily—will “analyze how the musician pushes social boundaries with her work.” We'll keep our poker face on for that one.
At Duke University, the student government senate voted Wednesday to deny the College Republicans funding for the rest of year after allegations suggested that the student group's president was ousted for being gay. The Duke Chronicle reported that the senate voted “against the club as a whole” rather than “individual members,” but e-mails obtained by the senate seem to confirm the homophobia. “The emails include a derogatory 'homosexual image,' gay remarks and racist and anti-Semitic messages,” The Chronicle reported.
In other news, in the same week that the Harvard Management Corporation revealed 11 percent investment returns for the 2009-10 fiscal year, one headline in New Haven was not so peachy. According to an article in The Yale Daily News,  the University's most recent tax filings show that the three fat cats  running Yale's endowment took home a combined $10.1 million in salary  and benefits during the 2008-09 fiscal year—even though Yale’s  endowment plummeted by 25 percent in the same period. For many years, the Yale  endowment’s CIO David Swensen has been the campus’s highest-paid  individual, earning $5.3 million last year—almost a quarter more than he  had the year before. Yale’s president, Richard C. Levin, earned $1.5  million in salary and benefits, more than twice the salary of President  Drew G. Faust.

This post has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: September 13, 2010 
An earlier version of the Sept. 11 FlyBy post "Lady Gaga, Homophobia, and Investment Fail" stated that Yale’s endowment "plummeted by 25 percent last year." To clarify, Yale's endowment fell by that amount in the 2008-2009 fiscal year—not the 2009-2010 fiscal year.
