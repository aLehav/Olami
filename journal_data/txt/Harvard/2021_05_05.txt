After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a hamburger hysteria swept through the right-wing media and Republican politicians in response to false accusations that President Joe Biden was attempting to limit Americans’ meat consumption to meet his climate change targets.
This claim originated in a misleading article in a British tabloid that connected Biden’s climate change proposal to a 2020 academic paper discussing the implications of Americans’ dietary habits on national greenhouse gas emissions. Although the article was in no way related to Biden, Fox News host Jesse B. Watters reported that “Americans are going to have to cut their red meat consumption by 90 percent in order to reduce emissions to hit Biden's target.” U.S. House Representative Lauren O. Boebert (R-Colo.) warned Biden to “stay out of my kitchen.”
The frenzy to protect red meat consumption illustrates just how partisan the American Burger has become. This seemingly plain sandwich now embodies traditional values, limited government, freedom of consumer choice, and textbook climate change denialism.
Harvard University strives to embody the antithesis of hamburger hysteria: The institution is committed to the pursuit of truth, and it has taken steps to address climate change. Harvard University Dining Services has also made strides to inform students about sustainable consumption habits.
Despite these differences, HUDS and Fox News do share one similarity: a commitment to serving meatatarians, or people who eat A LOT of meat.
To highlight this point, one must only look back to 2012 when HUDS refused to join more than a hundred universities that do not serve meat on Mondays, even though 70 percent of graduate students voted in favor of the proposal. In response to the decision, the manager of the graduate dining service stated that “we cannot and will not go meat free for any dinner service.”
Almost ten years later, a similar trend remains. HUDS continues to serve around two to four entrees per meal containing meat products and several side dishes (not to mention grill offerings), with limited options for vegetarians — let alone for vegans. Vegetarian and vegan meals are often combined together so that it is difficult for students to eat according to their specific needs. Additionally, many students report that vegetarian or vegan options consist of low-protein vegetables and carbohydrates, and thus lack the nutritional value of a meatatarian meal. Others feel the options are limited, repetitive, and don’t taste good.
In these ways, Harvard seems to predominantly cater to meatatarians, while plant-based diets are an afterthought. The status quo may be more acceptable if the vast majority of Harvard students actually consumed animal-based products. A recent survey, however, reveals that meatatarians make up a much smaller percentage of the student population than the HUDS’s menu reflects.
Several freshmen in Expository Writing preceptor Sparsha Saha’s Animals and Politics course recently surveyed Harvard students to better understand how and why they consume the food they do. 129 survey respondents followed the following diets: 11 percent vegetarian, 6 percent vegan, 26 percent flexitarian (making a regular effort to reduce meat consumption), and 5 percent pescatarian. 45 percent consume meat without restriction.
More respondents preferred diets with reduced or no meat consumption than those who do. In addition, 70 percent of respondents who do not make a regular effort to reduce their meat consumption reported that they “would transition to a more plant-based diet if HUDS offered a greater variety of tasty plant-based options.”
There is an apparent disconnect between what many students want served in the dining halls and what is being provided. In response, many students are currently calling upon Harvard to provide more options through a petition.
HUDS can address this disparity by serving plant-based options in equal proportion to student diet preferences. To do so, Harvard can provide HUDS with more financial resources to expand its total meal offerings. Or, HUDS can maintain its budget while substituting some of the many animal-based meals with vegan or vegetarian alternatives (which have been shown to be cheaper and easier to prepare than meat and fish).
I can already envision critics replying: “But what about my right to consume meat?” From health concerns, cultural values, family traditions, to the simple reality that meat tastes good, there are many different reasons why individuals choose to consume meat — and all of these choices must be respected.
No one, however, is proposing to eliminate animal-based products at Harvard, or nationally, for that matter. Animal-based products are plentiful both in and out of the dining halls.
Is it simultaneously true that vegetarians and vegans have the same right to options as meatatarians do, and for equally valid reasons. Reducing meat consumption is a crucial way to limit an individual’s carbon footprint. Others choose diets to disincentivize the proliferation of animal abuse in the food industry. Many believe plant-based diets are healthier than animal-based diets.
In comparison to meatatarians, these students struggle to live up to their own ethical standards and cultural values while obtaining the nutrition they need because their preferences are not catered to.
There are many complicated reasons why each of us consumes the food we do. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, vegan or meatatarian, we can agree that we have the right to maintain our diets of choice. Let’s work together to make sure that everyone has that right by ensuring that the diversity of meal offerings reflects the diverse preferences of Harvard’s student body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last few months alone, we’ve seen several high-profile Harvard Law School graduates grace the news with unseemly headlines: vacationing during a massively impactful crisis, distorting the truth through non-stop falsities, or engaging in inappropriate use of governmental resources. The trend makes it tempting to view Harvard’s legal education as a corrupting force.
But it isn’t, or at least it doesn’t have to be. Sometimes our Law School can make us proud, with brave alumni who showcase the very best of our ideals and ambitions — the very best of Harvard, even.
Last month was such an occasion. After over a decade’s worth of litigation, Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic secured a landmark victory: A federal judge upheld a 2018 ruling that sentenced former Bolivian president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and former Bolivian defense minister José Carlos Sánchez Berzaín to $10 million in compensatory damages for their role in the 2003 massacre of Indigenous Bolivians.
The decision brings some closure to a dark chapter of Bolivian history, a tiny but long overdue slice of justice to the families of the victims of state-organized violence. It offers some solace to those who, in the aftermath of massive protests against a government plan to export natural gas through Chile, witnessed how their own government instructed the military to turn violently against its own citizens.
The original suit, filed in 2007 by HLS’s International Human Rights Clinic at the insistence of then second-year student Thomas B. Becker, charged Bolivia’s former officials with ordering the killings of 67 civilians. The two officials had fled Bolivia for the United States, but Becker believed that justice could follow them here and he found a way to make it happen. This case marked the first time that a former head of state sat before his accusers in a U.S. human rights trial.
Notably, the case was filed on behalf of 10 members of Bolivia’s Indigenous population, and named after the two plaintiffs, Etelvina Ramos Mamani and Eloy Rojas Mamani, who lost their eight-year-old daughter to stray bullet. In the words of the current International Human Rights Clinic co-director Susan H. Farbstein, the case was “driven and led by the plaintiffs” who, despite immense personal loss, chose to fight back. We commend them for their strength, perseverance, and the crucial part they played in a historic legal victory — and we hope that this ruling will bring them some solace.
This case is a shining example of the power of the Law School’s clinics and student-driven efforts. It proves, pretty decisively, that our education — at the Law School, and perhaps the College — doesn’t have to remain untethered from the world around us; it exemplifies the virtues of showing students the pathway to future careers in meaningful, but frequently less remunerative, fields.
The impact of this clinic and similar initiatives, of equipping our peers with a substantial understanding and appreciation for human rights and a variety of other causes, can’t be understated. Harvard’s mission, after all, is to train the citizen leaders of tomorrow — sometimes, this is best done outside a classroom.
The Law School’s clinics are not infallible (few things are), and there are times when we may disagree with the actions they take. Yet, without reservation — a phrase rarely used by this Editorial Board — we commend the International Human Rights Clinic’s role in this case, and congratulate those involved, especially the plaintiffs, on this important victory,
Perhaps the chief lesson to be learned from this success is that genuine, compassionate conviction can take our alumni far. We hope to see more of it, for the sake of both Harvard and the world it hopes to lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mission of the Institute of Politics is to inspire students, particularly undergraduates, “to consider careers in politics and public service.” However, the IOP is struggling to meet its mission right now. According to The Crimson Editorial Board, it is an “ironic masterclass for the worst of government.”
I joined the IOP in September 2018 as a student organizer for the Harvard Votes Challenge. Then I co-led a student-staff task force to transform HVC into the IOP’s 16th student program, ensuring that HVC would receive institutional support and funding for years to come. After graduating in May 2019, I joined the IOP as a part-time civic engagement strategist before becoming a full-time, unionized staff assistant.
In February, I began asking questions about staff and student labor practices, gender-based harassment, racial microaggressions, and financial accessibility at the IOP. Instead of taking substantive and immediate action, the IOP and Harvard Kennedy School questioned my health, encouraged me to take a medical leave of absence, presented me with a severance contract, locked me out of my work email, temporarily withheld my overtime pay, and sent me a letter telling me to resign on April 2. Although I contested my termination numerous times, the IOP and HKS did not relent — leaving me without a paycheck or healthcare during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have been writing openly about my experiences on Medium ever since.
This series of unfortunate events, which unfolded out of line with Harvard’s union-bargained disciplinary process, is yet another case study in the IOP’s “ironic masterclass for the worst of government” offered every semester. Based on numerous internal conversations, I have learned that IOP and HKS leadership are chiefly concerned with protecting the reputation of the IOP — and by extension, their own professional careers. Consequently, they ignore or bury problems instead of aggressively tackling the systemic challenges that underlie such problems.
Though the IOP has worked tirelessly to maintain a pristine facade, the curtain fell on April 20, when The Crimson published an investigation into the dysfunctional relationship between the IOP and HKS and the systemic challenges plaguing the Institute. This drew much public attention to the IOP’s poor governance and its adverse impact on students.
By allowing systemic challenges to fester, IOP and HKS leadership have undermined the Institute’s reputation while threatening the safety and careers of its staff and students. If IOP and HKS leadership truly want to protect the Institute’s reputation, they must lead by example and take the following bold, substantive, and immediate actions.
Public acknowledgment: Release a public statement describing the Institute’s plan to address the systemic challenges that it currently faces. This statement should include a progress update that responds directly to the unreleased report conducted by the Derek Bok Center in spring 2019 and the critical institutional review conducted by IOP student leaders from fall 2019 through spring 2020.
Put safety first: Reimagine the IOP’s policies and practices to protect student and staff members’ physical and psychological safety. This should include creating a staff-student code of conduct, requiring all IOP staff members to participate in relevant Harvard College, HKS, and university-wide training, and establishing and maintaining an anonymous feedback system.
Clarify and explicitly state the IOP’s mission, vision, and core values: Use these to prioritize and streamline IOP programming and strategically allocate time, money, and personnel.
Democratize decision-making processes: Listening to and actually incorporating feedback from all stakeholders on an ongoing basis, explaining how decisions are made and who the decision-makers are, setting concrete deadlines, and leveraging new software and communications platforms for information sharing and project management.
Formalize Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging: Create a full-time position for a Director of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging who will reengineer the IOP’s culture to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.
The Crimson reports that “Harvard alumni compose one-third of Biden’s cabinet.” In fact, former IOP Student Advisory Committee President, Peter M. Buttigieg ‘04, currently serves as the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. All students who attend Harvard, including those who participate in IOP programming, go on to lead lives of consequence. As I wrote recently, “The IOP is one of many places on Harvard’s campus where our public servants of tomorrow receive leadership training today. Thus, it is the responsibility of IOP, HKS, and Harvard leadership to lead by example and to model the behaviors that we desire in our public leaders.”
Most students and staff leave the IOP with the skills and network necessary for finding success in politics and public service. But I want us to leave the IOP with the practical expertise that comes from recognizing our Institute’s own shortcomings and hypocrisy and then rebuilding the Institute to be a community where all people feel valued, respected, and a sense of belonging.
A former IOP Fellow recently told me that “to love an institution is to change it” and “believing in an institution is being willing to challenge it.” If we believe in the promise of the IOP’s mission and if we commit to reimagining the Institute to better meet that mission, then we will leave better equipped to become the public leaders that our world needs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s annual Climate Change Solutions Fund awarded $1 million in funding last month to nine projects spanning the University’s 12 schools.
The fund, which was founded by former University President Drew G. Faust in 2014, will help finance research initiatives focused on combating climate change and improving clean energy efficiency.
“Pursuing a more sustainable future means advancing on several fronts to address the tremendous challenges posed by climate change,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow told the Harvard Gazette, a University publication. “The projects being funded this year draw on strengths from across the University and among a wide swath of researchers and scholars. I look forward to seeing where their efforts lead us in the years ahead.”
This year’s iteration of funded projects range from the creation of more efficient fuel cells to the examination of how tropical forests respond to heightened carbon levels in the atmosphere.
The global electric vehicle battery market is projected to reach more than $80 billion in 2027, but challenges like technological limitations on charging time, safety, and driving range remain, according to CCSF grant recipient and Professor of Material Sciences Xin Li.
Li noted that while graphite anode batteries are used commercially in electric vehicles, they require overnight charging and contain flammable liquid electrolyte. Meanwhile, lithium metal anode batteries are capable of achieving tenfold higher current densities and therefore require drastically shorter charging times.
A major problem with lithium metal anode batteries, however, is their tendency to cause internal short circuits due to lithium forming between cathode and anode. Li said his project may offer a solution.
“It was unsolved for thirty years, but we've demonstrated that a solid-state battery may enable lithium metal anodes,” Li said.
He said his group did not observe short circuits even after testing 10,000 charge-discharge cycles in their lab-scale battery.
“Many of the good performances that we have demonstrated we expect will be repeatable when we scale up,” he said.
Li said the climate fund’s grant will enable his team to continue testing and increase the size of their battery design.
As for the timescale of application to electric vehicles, Li said he expects to see good solid-state battery performance in vehicles within the next few years, and that commercialization would soon follow — giving an “optimistic” estimate of five years.
While researchers such as Li work to combat climate change by improving existing technology, other grant recipients are assessing and streamlining current policies.
CCSF award recipient and research associate Shaojie Song’s work centers on identifying sources of methane as significant contributors to global warming. Song and his co-investigator J. William “Bill” Munger chose to focus on methane in Beijing, in part due to China’s coal-to-gas policy introduced in 2013.
While the policy was designed to benefit residents by improving air quality, it involved the construction of new natural gas lines, which may cause methane to leak into the environment.
Song explained methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide, so even seemingly small sources such as pipeline leaks could have a significant impact on global warming. He added that methane has a short lifetime in comparison to carbon dioxide, so controlling methane levels could provide a “fast solution” to climate change.
Song and Munger were already aware of methane sources such as landfills and livestock, but not natural gas lines and appliances. They will now pinpoint these leakage sources and distinguish between them before working with engineers and economists to devise a control strategy.
Part of the CCSF grant will be used to “leave a legacy of ongoing observations that can monitor for changes and trends” in methane levels, according to Munger.
CCSF grant recipient Shweta M. Bhogale, a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, will look to address the growing water crisis caused by climate change through her research. Her project focuses on evaluating the competition for groundwater in India and its effect on the local agriculture and water levels.
“With climate change, as rainfall gets more and more uncertain, groundwater just has that kind of insurance that agriculture can rely on,” Bhogale said. “With rampant water extraction all over, India is now in a situation — it’s on the brink of a major water crisis — and over half of the country is severely water stressed.”
Bhogale said that one of the “biggest motivators” for her research is to better understand the “constraints and determinants” of groundwater extraction and water use for agriculture in India.
“If competition for groundwater is very high and that leads you to extract more water or grow more crops that are water intensive, then understanding that — establishing the extent to which this competition matters — is essential,” Bhogale said.
The project aims to get to the root of unsustainable groundwater practices and offer more sustainable solutions. She said understanding the “institutional framework” surrounding the competition is essential to removing the “adverse effects” of competition for groundwater extraction.
Though many of the projects focus on human-made solutions to address climate change, the work of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Naomi E. Pierce examines how nature has already created its own solutions.
While examining the physiology of butterfly wings, Pierce’s research group found that certain wing scales have structures that allow them to keep cool, ensuring their survival.
Pierce explained the wing scales consist of many “channels” that are “just the right wavelength” to trap near-infrared waves, a form of heat radiation in sunlight. The scales absorb the heat and keep the butterfly’s wings cool underneath.
Their newly funded project aims to predict more useful features like the heat-trapping scales among Lepidoptera specimens — an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths — through an imaging platform and collections in Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology.
Richard A. Childers, a postdoctoral researcher working on the project, said that a lot of previous “materials discovery” work on butterflies has been performed “haphazardly” — that certain features were discovered by chance — but that this project is dedicated to identifying them specifically.
“We’re really looking to do this in a systematic, organized fashion and see how much more can we find when you're really looking at all the diversity of butterflies and moths,” Childers said.
He added that he believes studying butterflies’ evolutionary features has potential to provide creative solutions to climate change.
“Butterflies have had hundreds of millions of years to come up with all these different materials for their own ends, but there’s a lot there that we can potentially use for many different applications,” Childers said. “That’s our job in this — shining a spotlight on what those might be.”
Assistant Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Benton N. Taylor is working on a CCSF-funded project that will observe how tropical forests have responded to increased carbon dioxide levels near volcanic vents.
Forests have the potential to grow much larger under elevated carbon dioxide levels in the future, allowing them to capture more carbon and help “mitigate the pace of climate change,” according to Taylor.
To test forest growth under elevated carbon dioxide conditions, researchers have conducted several large-scale experiments known as free-air carbon dioxide enrichment experiments, or FACE experiments, per Taylor.
“These are multimillion dollar experiments where we actually fumigate large sections of real forests with extra CO2 to simulate what the atmosphere is going to look like in 100 years from now and see how the forests respond to that kind of thing,” Taylor said. “Those are really the gold standard for our understanding of how forests will respond to future climate change.”
However, the FACE experiments are “effectively completely logistically impossible” in tropical forests, which will be “particularly critical” for the “global forest response” to elevated carbon dioxide levels, Taylor added.
Taylor said the project he will be working on aims to examine sites in tropical forests in Costa Rica near volcanic vents, which naturally emit high concentrations of carbon dioxide.
“The idea is that these sites could serve as a natural FACE experiment for tropical forests and give us the first actual evidence as to whether or not tropical forests are going to help mitigate the pace of climate change,” Taylor said.
Taylor noted how this tropical forest environment will include forests that have experienced naturally high carbon dioxide levels for their “entire existence.” This forest environment stands in contrast to forests previously observed in FACE experiments, which were suddenly exposed to artificially elevated carbon dioxide levels.
Applications for next year’s funding cycle will be released in July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators outlined responses the University has taken regarding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein’s ties to Harvard during a monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday.
After University President Lawrence S. Bacow initiated a review into Epstein’s ties to Harvard in 2019, the committee recommended in 2020 that Harvard revise its policies concerning external gifts as well as those regarding appointments of visiting fellows.
Bacow said Tuesday one of the changes the University made after the report was increasing vetting of external gifts prior to acceptance. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 additionally reminded faculty of the University’s gift policy guide released in May 2020.
Bacow said while some policies for reviewing donor gifts had existed before the Epstein report, “they failed us here” because the University lacked a centralized system to “implement the policies as they were written.”
“Our decentralized structure was such that it was possible for a decision to be made by the president not to accept a gift from a donor, and for various parts of the institution not to hear that,” Bacow said. “That was, in part, because we did not have development officers report up to one individual.”
Fundraising deans from across Harvard’s schools now all report to Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee and meet on a biweekly basis, according to Bacow. He said this new practice ensures University decisions to reject donor gifts can be “easily and directly communicated” to prevent Harvard affiliates from accepting gifts from a previously rejected donor.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench said while GSAS also previously had requirements in place that technically prevented Epstein from being eligible for a visiting fellowship, the School lacked “safeguards” at the time of Epstein’s appointment to review requested exceptions to the policy.
“Those safeguards are now in place, so any requested exceptions to the written policy must be personally reviewed and decided by the GSAS Dean, and the GSAS Dean may consult with other faculty as the Dean deems appropriate,” Dench said.
At the faculty meeting, administrators also discussed a new University-wide standardized system to report conflicts of interest and financial disclosure. Vice Provost for Research Richard D. McCullough also shared that the University’s new policy would require reporting with a “zero dollar threshold.”
“About a year and a half ago, we set out to take a look at the financial COI policy and created an online tool to make it easier for reporting to occur on both financial COI and outside activities, and to align the schools to have a single University policy, especially given the several joint departments we have at the University and multiple faculty with joint appointments,” McCullough said.
He acknowledged the recent attention shed on University researchers and their financial ties. In November 2018, the Justice Department established the China Initiative in an attempt to curb intellectual property theft by China. Notably, under the program, officials arrested Charles M. Lieber — the former Harvard Chemistry department chair — last January on charges of lying to federal officials about his involvement in a Chinese talent recruitment program.
Though McCullough said 90 percent of FAS faculty had filled out the new disclosure forms, some faculty in attendance had qualms about the new policies.
“There’s no clear reason why academic talks given outside of the U.S. should be treated differently,” said Derek J. Penslar, a History professor. “The increasing currency of Zoom has only led to increased Zoom gatherings."
“Staff assistants have been whittled away, and now it turns out we need to keep our own records for reporting policies,” said Ann M. Blair ’84, chair of the History department. “I hope there is some flexibility in how this can be implemented in a way that is less burdensome.”
Garber concluded the meeting by thanking faculty members for their cooperation and stating that University officials are “committed to working with” faculty, while noting that many of the reporting requirements are outside the University’s decision-making scope.
“The federal government has instituted requirements, and the fact is that it influences everything we do in this area,” Garber said. “There is incredible time pressure, and I deeply regret that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After attending bargaining sessions with Harvard to negotiate the graduate student union’s second contract, rank-and-file union members said the University’s bargaining team was resistant to the union’s proposed changes, especially on the topics of compensation and procedures for handling complaints of identity-based discrimination and sexual harassment.
“There’s a palpable sense of resistance to really engage in the discussion,” said Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers member Harrison T. Reeder, a Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate.
HGSU-UAW and the University have held four bargaining sessions since March 18, and agreed to open the bargaining sessions on April 9, April 19, and April 26 to union members. Approximately 40 to 80 members observed each of the three open sessions, according to HGSU-UAW Vice President Marisa J. Borreggine. The May 6, May 18, and May 24 sessions will also be open to observers, and more open sessions could be added.
“[At each session] you saw dozens of student workers who had the crimson background as a sign of solidarity and support for the union,” HGSU-UAW member and Law School student Sebastian B. Spitz said.
According to members in attendance, each side screenshares its proposed contract changes. Harvard and the union bargaining committee members then discuss the provisions. After proposals are made, the other party returns at a later session with its edits in a counter-proposal, which is discussed.
“When you see these documents, it’s quite visible in black and white and red,” Reeder said. “It stands out when the counter-proposal [from the University] is removal of all the [union’s] changes.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on any criticisms from union members who observed the sessions.
The first three bargaining sessions open to members addressed grievance procedures, union security, hiring processes, remote work, mental health care, support for international student workers, compensation, and benefits. According to observers, most of the discussion centered around grievance procedures, compensation, and benefits.
HGSU-UAW is still calling for cases concerning discrimination, harassment, and academic retaliation to be open to third-party arbitration. Under the current contract, such complaints are “processed in accordance with the internal policies and procedures developed by the University or the individual schools.”
HGSU-UAW member and Slavic Languages and Literature Ph.D. candidate Maya A. A. Garcia said it was “frustrating” to see what she felt was the University picking apart or dismissing the union’s proposals. According to Garcia, seeing Harvard’s bargaining team face-to-face, though virtually, has been an “emotional experience.”
“There’s all these communication issues in the sense that their lawyers don’t take us seriously or question us to an extent that, if you aren’t super confident in yourself and the unionization effort, you might start to waiver,” Garcia said.
Five of the members who observed a session said they viewed union members’ access to third-party arbitration for complaints of discrimination and harassment as one of their top priorities for the contract. During the April 9 session, the union presented their proposal on this issue, calling for additional categories to be protected under the contract’s non-discrimination provision, such as caste, medical conditions, personal appearance, class and class background, accents, and prior criminal convictions.
Spitz, Garcia, and History of Art and Architecture Ph.D. candidate Juliana Ramírez Herrera criticized the University for extensively questioning the addition of these protected categories.
“A very logical thing to do is to say that you cannot discriminate on the basis of caste at Harvard,” Spitz said. “And yet, the University just went on and on asking questions: ‘What is caste? Is it the same as race, is it the same as nationality, is it the same as class?’”
Spitz added he and other members were “very disappointed” that the University was “stalling” by asking for definitions of each category.
“It seemed to me like they were wasting time and that someone who’s representing Harvard University can figure out what the definition of caste is and what it is we’re referring to without having a 20-minute discussion,” he added.
Ramírez Herrera said she believes the University would only consider providing non-discrimination protection for these additional aspects of identity if the union provided precedent — from a previous contract or past instances of discrimination — to justify it, which she found “odd.”
“Why are we waiting for these instances to emerge for them to be then considered discrimination?” Ramírez Herrera said. “Why can’t we be proactive in foreseeing potential moments?”
At the April 26 session, the University rejected the union’s proposed changes to discrimination and harassment procedures, according to a union bargaining update. HGSU-UAW member and Population Health Sciences Ph.D. candidate Matthew M. Lee wrote in an email that he felt “disappointed, though not entirely surprised” by Harvard’s rejection.
The union also started introducing its economic proposals during the April 26 session, opening the negotiations with substantial proposed changes to compensation, such as an initial 9.74 percent wage increase. Members noted gaps between their experiences and the University’s positions on those issues, particularly regarding childcare and rent.
“You have to become a bit of a numbers person as a grad student in terms of budgeting,” Garcia said. “I kept track of every dollar I spent, every coffee I bought, and had strict limits on everything so that I could make that stipend work in the Cambridge market.”
Making rent in the Cambridge area, Garcia said, is especially taxing.
Garcia said she plans on testifying at upcoming sessions about the necessity of compensation increases. Jennifer L. Cruz, a union member and Population Health Sciences Ph.D. candidate, said she does not believe the University is considering the toll rent takes on her livelihood.
“That is not acknowledged in these sessions,” Cruz said. “This is just a paycheck that they’re sending into the abyss and they aren’t acknowledging the impact that it has.”
The next bargaining session open to members is scheduled for Thursday. HGSU-UAW member Anna Yu Wang, a Music Ph.D. candidate, said she would like to see Harvard more willing to “empathize” with student workers in the future.
“I think that open bargaining is such an important way of maintaining accountability to how the University is approaching these negotiations,” Yu Wang said. “Their attitude, their disposition at the bargaining table, tells us a lot about who the University is and what their values truly are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the school year nears a close, administrators in the Dean of Students Office reflected on students' experiences during the past academic year amid the coronavirus pandemic in an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday.
Harvard held courses online during the 2020-2021 academic year due to the public health crisis. For the fall semester, the College only invited freshmen and a select group of upperclassmen to live in residence, while juniors, seniors, and a cohort of petitioning students were invited to campus in the spring.
Students living in residence had to comply with a spate of residential guidelines, including social distancing guidelines and Covid-19 testing three times per week.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said she was “grateful” for on-campus students’ adherence to residential guidelines and commended their adaptation to online learning.
“What we learned was how remarkably adaptable students were to these changes,” O’Dair said. “We are just incredibly grateful for all their commitments to abide by the rules.”
“I think students also adapted to the online learning environment, and in some ways, though, that online learning environment was better for some students,” O’Dair added.
Assistant Dean of Student Engagement and Leadership Kate T. Colleran said that she appreciated students’ flexibility.
“We’ve been watching the student orgs process through the whole cycle of the year and really feeling the loss of their in-person events but then coming back strong in the spring with virtual Eleganza and Ghungroo and participation in Virtual Visitas,” Colleran said. “It was so great to see them come back with those traditional events this spring, even though they had to look different.”
Colleran added that the College was able to host an in-person light show called Lucidity, which she said attracted more than 300 students over the course of three days.
“It was really nice to see students dropping by being like, ‘Oh my goodness, this is an event, this is in-person, I can come to this,” Colleran said.
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said that “collaboration and coordination” aided the DSO in its support of students and their experiences.
“This year has just illustrated the extent to which collaboration and coordination is really one of the strengths that we can bring,” Brandt said. “So many different stakeholders are involved in supporting all of the community and all of the student experience.”
“It’s just been inspiring to see everyone really trying to work together provide the best possible experience in a very difficult time,” she added.
The administrators also reflected on their progress over the past year in making the DSO an anti-racist organization.
Associate Dean of Students for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro said she was “proud” of the work the DSO has done to achieve that goal.
“I feel really proud of the progress that we’ve made, and one of things I’m proudest about is that we don’t feel so proud that we think the work is over,” Mauro said. “We have a commitment to extending our work in this area.”
“I feel good about the actual things that are in place that will carry on into the fall. We'll also need to take a fresh look, right, and so we’ll need to say what have we learned about ourselves and about our organization, and then how do we calibrate and move forward,” Mauro added.

Decision day was Monday. So, congratulations on finally committing to the most ~transformative~ experience of your life, Class of 2025. Now that you can officially say that you are #HarvardBound, you might want to start thinking about how to humble brag while introducing yourself on social media. Nervous? Don’t be. Flyby is here to make sure your Harvard intro blurb will leave a lasting and good impression to your future classmates with the dos and don’ts in writing it.
Don’t: Brag about your other acceptances
We get it, you’re smart and had a very successful college admission season. Still, that doesn’t mean we want to hear how you got accepted to every single school you applied to. You’ll just seem like an arrogant showoff. Who cares if you got into all 8 Ivies and Stanford? We’re all going to the same school now.
Do: List your interests and hobbies
At the end of the day, you’re writing these intro posts to connect with your future classmates and make some friends over the summer. So make sure to list your hobbies and interests. Is there a K-drama that you’re currently obsessed with? Include it. Chances are someone is also interested in the same show and you just got yourself a new watch buddy.
Don’t: Link your LinkedIn profile
Maybe this is just a personal preference, but I always scoff when people drop their LinkedIn in their bio. It’s just the social media version of showing off your resume. Do you really want to be that person?
Do: Include your other social media 
With that said, Facebook posts aren’t the best way to keep in touch with people. So do make sure to include your Insta, Snapchat, and even TikTok, and prepare to make some new friends!
Don’t: Be weirdly passive aggressive about your past
Not all of us had a great high school experience. Still, it always rubs me the wrong way when people rant about their terrible experiences in high school or even during the college admission season in their intro post. It’s TMI and just weird.
For the first impression, let’s just stick to good vibes.
Do: Be Short and Concise 
I’m sure you are all very excited to get to know each other. But I guarantee you, no amount of enthusiasm will make people willing to read an entire essay about some random people they’ve never met before in real life. So keep your blurb short and sweet and save your big brain juice for the writing placement exam.
Once again, welcome to your home for the next four years, Class of 2025! We hope this list offers some good advice for you to create your quintessential Harvard announcement post. Though tbh, don’t stress about it. These intro burbs are supposed to be fun and relaxing. And even if you mess up, you will have another chance to make a first impression during orientation!
