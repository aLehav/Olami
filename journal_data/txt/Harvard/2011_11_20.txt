After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
E. Benjamin Samuels '13 will lead the newly-elected 139th Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the paper's president announced on Friday.
Samuels, a Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations concentrator from Pasadena, Calif., and a Lowell House resident, is an associate sports editor who covers Harvard football and men's hockey and leads The Crimson's sports comp. He has also been an operations manager for The Crimson since the start of this year.
Samuels will assume the president's post in the beginning of January.
The paper's outgoing editors elected their successors early Friday morning, and the president of the 138th Guard, Naveen N. Srivatsa '12, announced the results to The Crimson's staff soon after.
"The leaders of the 139th Guard have the drive and the talent they need to take The Crimson to new heights," Srivatsa said. "All of us can look forward to an exceptionally strong year ahead, and I know I'm eagerly looking forward to their accomplishments."
The Crimson's next managing editor will be Julie M. Zauzmer '13, a Crimson blog executive and news writer who has covered the College administration as well as the Adam Wheeler and Kirkland shooting trials. J. Sebastian Garcia '13, a Crimson advertising manager, will head the organization's finances and operations as The Crimson's next business manager.
The Crimson, founded in 1873, is the only daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., and the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper.
The Crimson chooses its leaders through an election process known as "the turkey shoot," in which all outgoing executives are invited to participate. A successful candidate must receive at least 75 percent of the vote.
Joining Samuels, Zauzmer, and Garcia on the masthead are:
Associate Managing Editors: Gautam S. Kumar '13 and Zoe A. Y. Weinberg '13
Associate Business Manager: Zhao Zhang '13
Arts Chairs: Keerthi Reddy '14 and Alexander E. Traub '13

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four members of the Class of 2012 will spend the next two to three years studying at Oxford University free of cost after attaining the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship, the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.
Samuel M. Galler ’12, Spencer B. L. Lenfield ’12, Brett A. Rosenberg ’12, and Victor W. Yang ’12 competed with 830 students from 299 different colleges and universities for the 32 spots allotted to American applicants. A total of 83 scholarships were granted worldwide.
Lenfield, a history and literature concentrator in Eliot House, said he is excited to interact with some of the world’s brightest and most promising students.
“There’s an incredible community of former Rhodes Scholars you get to join,” he said. “It’s an honor to be considered in the same group as them. At the same time, it’s a phenomenal resource to be presented with.”
The Rhodes Trust does not require applicants to have a specific program of study at the time of application, but the four recipients plan to continue in areas related to their undergraduate study.
Galler, who pursued Advanced Standing at Harvard, will graduate this spring with a bachelor’s degree in East Asian studies as well as a master’s in East Asian regional studies. The Quincy House senior is currently working on a thesis on the activity of non-governmental organizations in reaction to the spread of HIV/AIDS in China.
“I want to combine global health and regional studies and apply what I’ve been learning to health reform in China, or at least to health policy issues,” said Galler of his future goals.
Lenfield specializes in intellectual history in Great Britain during the 19th and 20th centuries, with emphasis on the Victorians and their impact on the present. For him, the chance to study in Great Britain, with easy access to British archival material, is an added bonus to being at Oxford.
“I’m really interested in the 20th century in Great Britain and America,” Lenfield said. “The development of the ways individuals relate to each other.”
Rosenberg, a history concentrator in Cabot House, has worked as a research assistant to prominent History Professor Niall C. D. Ferguson on a history of the Cold War, which is also the subject of her thesis.
“I was drawn to the Cold War for the silly reason that spies are fun,” Rosenberg said. “But I’ve been lucky enough to work with Professor Ferguson.”
Rosenberg’s passion for the Cold War will likely extend to Oxford, where she plans to study international relations with a focus on the Cold War era in particular.
Yang, a history and science concentrator in Winthrop House, first became interested in health issues as a volunteer in underserved areas of Boston. Yang has since focused on the intersection of medicine and society. His thesis examines non-traditional views of AIDS activism, particularly among minority groups.
At Oxford, he will be a part of a new program in public policy beginning next fall.
The Rhodes Scholarships’s lengthy and arduous application process takes place over more than three months. Students must first earn the endorsement of their college or university before filling out pages of applications and taking part in a series of interviews.
The interviews themselves cover a wide range of topics and require applicants to eloquently respond to a number of prompts they may know nothing about.
Galler, a former member of the a cappella group Din & Tonics, was even asked to sing for his interviewers. He performed the Chinese national anthem to complement his work in East Asian studies.
The four scholars said they are still in shock about being honored with the scholarship.
“In a lot of ways it feels like the magnificent day when I got into Harvard all over again,” Lenfield said.
The four recipients join a long list of Harvard Rhodes Scholars, as 336 Harvard graduates have received the scholarship in the past, including last year’s four scholars from Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After almost a year of planning, negotiating, and remodeling, the Harvard Innovation Lab—a $20 million project designed to foster entrepreneurship in the Harvard and Boston community—officially opened its doors Friday afternoon.
“It’s been a whirlwind,” said Gordon S. Jones, the i-lab’s director. “It feels like that hectic period of six months of anticipation leading up to my child’s first day of school.”
With the snip of a red ribbon the i-lab was literally ready for business, opening its doors so that local businesses, non-profits, entrepreneurs, and University affiliates can discuss and realize their plans.
The opening ceremony packed the i-lab with University students and affiliates and local community members sporting business suits and conversing about the entrepreneurial possibilities the new facility could bring.
“I think it’s gorgeous,” said Daniel A. Koh ’07, a graduate of Harvard Business School. “It incorporates the feel of a typical entrepreneurial environment with Harvard’s special touch.”
The i-lab sits on the first floor of Batten Hall on 125 Western Ave. and is equipped with a coffee shop and a 24/7 public meeting space. Local artwork hangs from the walls and ceiling, pillars double as white boards, and bright orange chairs swivel to create what Jones called a “flexible space.”
“Great ideas and great thinking don’t always happen at a desk,” Jones said. “They can happen in unconventional places because your mind starts to think in more unconventional ways.”
While the facility is designed to provide resources for start-ups, it is also a start-up of sorts itself.
The i-lab is the first realized step in a series of measures the University is taking to develop a technological hub in Allston, similar to MIT’s Kendall Square.
Though the i-lab is the first part of this plan to come to fruition, it is not the centerpiece of Harvard’s plan.
Harvard broke ground on the Allston Science Complex in 2009, a project with an estimated $1 billion price tag that was meant to be a crown jewel of Harvard’s interdisciplinary science facilities. But due to financial constraints, University President Drew G. Faust halted construction on the site.
Since then, many Allston residents have said they are skeptical about the University’s plans for expansion in the neighborhood and have expressed a myriad of concerns about the i-lab’s place in the community. In past Harvard Allston Task Force meetings, some residents have said that they are worried that they will not enjoy the same access to the facility as Harvard affiliates.
But according to Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, the i-lab is a place where University members can work together with residents to create “new relations with Allston neighbors.”
In her welcoming speech during the ceremony, Faust explained that beyond serving as a place where the “fruits of innovation” can be cultivated, the i-lab is where her vision of “one University” comes alive.
“We are gathering great minds under a single roof so they can become greater together,” Faust said.
Faust added that when Facebook founder and Harvard dropout Mark E. Zuckerberg visited campus two weeks ago, he specifically requested a tour of the i-lab and told Faust that had the facility existed when he was an undergraduate, he would have spent many hours there.
This past week University students were able to participate in a preview of the i-lab through its “Start-up Weekend Scramble”—an event that paired undergraduate and graduate students with mentors and tasked them with creating a start-up in one weekend. Monica S. Liu ’12 said she used the event to receive advice from mentors and pitch her start-up Townhall 140, a virtual platform that connects users with leaders on political issues.
“The i-lab is incredibly exciting, there’s a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that makes you feel welcome and really fosters creativity and collaboration,” Liu said.  “We couldn’t have built our product and pushed our alpha launch through in 48 hours without the i-lab team’s help.”
Jones explained that future business workshops will be provided by local organizations such as the Small Business Administration, Service Corps of Retired Executives, Center for Women & Enterprise, and the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center Network.
“At the i-lab, we start with community,” Jones said. “One of our primary goals is helping small businesses take their ideas further.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Esteemed writer Gay  Talese—considered one of the fathers of the “new journalism” style in  the 1960s—spoke to a crowd of fans and writers about narrative  journalism in Boylston Hall on Friday.
Talese has written several famous narrative pieces like “Frank Sinatra  Has a Cold” for publications ranging from Esquire to The New Yorker, and  is credited with being one of the first writers to insert literary  techniques into journalism.
Part of a lecture series that is usually organized solely by  the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, Friday's talk was co-organized with the Harvard  Writers at Work lecture series to attract a broader audience.
Talese  shared some of his quirky writing methods, such as writing notes on  shirt boards. Talese also keeps nearly every piece of paper he comes  across, he said, including notes from his wife, rejection slips, and  interview notes. Talese collected 33 sets of notes from his interviews  with Frank Sinatra.
Keeping things is important to Talese, he said, because he often revisits his  notes and finds interesting pieces of the puzzle that he failed to  notice before.
“You should know that the story never ends,” Talese said.
Talese  also shared his disdain for modern reporting technology. He still  writes on yellow notepads with pencil and uses a typewriter.  Tape-recorders, Talese said, cheapen the relationship between the  reporter and the subject.
“You tend to fall prey to the charm of that, the ease of ... those  little, plastic, spinning wheels that give you everything, but give you  nothing,” Talese said.
As the son of Italian immigrants, Talese said he  always felt like an outsider. But Talese attributes his curiosity as a  journalist to this feeling.
“I always felt like I was divided as a person, and that was perfect for a journalist,” Talese said. “You can’t be an insider.”
To  catch the details that are essential in narrative non-fiction, Talese  said, a reporter has to master “the art of hanging out,” or spending a  lot of time with a subject.
Talese also emphasized the importance of dressing well to succeed in  journalism. He wore a pea-green suit, a yellow silk tie, and a  candy-cane striped dress shirt to the talk.
Talese, who started out  writing for newspapers, began writing narrative non-fiction because he  wanted to write about real people—a form he calls “stories with real  names.”
“I was thinking, ‘Why can’t I do as a non-fiction writer what short  story writers do, what dramatists do, what novelists do?’ which is write  scenes,” Talese said.
Writing about individual stories of success,  demotion, and perseverance, Talese said, is worthwhile because everyone  experiences these same things.
Just having finished a New Yorker story on Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga’s  collaboration, Talese is currently working on a narrative piece about  Joe Girardi, the manager of the New York Yankees.
Talese did  not always enjoy universal success. Many have accused him of writing  fiction, but Talese said his goal was to move beyond the restrictions of  news writing.
“I respected [news writers] because they got it right, but I didn’t want  to emulate them in any way because they were boring,” Talese said. “It  is getting it right, and then being a storyteller. And that means you  have to have characters.”

Building on momentum from a tight victory over Clarkson Friday night, the Harvard women’s hockey team (5-1, 5-1 ECAC) closed out its first weekend at home with another conference win—this time over St. Lawrence (6-5-3, 3-4-1) by a margin of 6-1—Saturday night at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson wasted no time getting on the board, as sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman tallied her second game-winning goal of the season with 19:04 to play in the first period. Freshman forward Hillary Crowe and junior defenseman Josephine Pucci were credited with assists on the play.
Eleven different players scored points for the Crimson Saturday night, as a balanced offensive effort helped Harvard over the Saints.
The Crimson was especially effective on the power play, going three-for-five on the night with man-up goals from freshman defenseman Sarah Edney, sophomore forward Gina McDonald, and junior defenseman Josephine Pucci.
Junior forward Jillian Dempsey led the team with five shots, while Pucci topped the squad with four points on one goal and two assists.
Harvard also found success on the penalty kill, stopping all eight of St. Lawrence’s power play opportunities.
Junior goaltender Laura Bellamy had a strong night between the pipes, recording 26 saves on the day. Bellamy currently owns a .943 save percentage.
Down 5-0 to start the third frame, the Saints tallied their only goal of the game at 12:54. But Harvard answered quickly, as Dempsey closed out the scoring for both teams with an empty net goal less than four minutes later.

The No. 1-ranked Harvard women's squash team (2-0) did not fail to impress last Friday, defeating No. 6 Stanford (1-1) and No. 9 Williams (1-2) to open its season with a 2-0 record.
Noticeably absent from the line-up were co-captain Cece Cortes and junior and 2010 CSA National Champion Laura Gemmell. Rookie Amanda Sobhy, the 2010 Junior Worlds Champion, was also absent.
But new blood mixed in with a solid group of returners to lift Harvard to victory.
Against the Cardinal, co-captain Nirasha Guruge, freshman Haley Mendez, and junior Natasha Kingshott each felled her opponent in straight frames en route to the Crimson’s 6-3 win. Junior Sarah Mumanachit, freshman Julie Chu, and junior Eliza Calihan also won their matches, 3-1.
Harvard had even better results against the Ephs—each player won in 3 games as the Crimson swept Williams, 9-0.
Junior Vidya Rajan, sophomore Natasha Anzik, and freshman Yuleissy Ramirez also notched 3-0 scores, thereby preventing the Ephs from winning a single game.

After fighting back to tie its game at 3 goals apiece, the Harvard men's hockey team (2-3-1) couldn't replicate the success of its football brethren, falling, 4-3, to St. Lawrence (4-6-0) Saturday night in Canton, N.Y.
The Crimson was the first on the scoreboard, with freshman defenseman Patrick McNally taking advantage on the power play.   Two minutes later, the Saints had a power play goal of their own from rookie Chris Martin.  St. Lawrence was 2-for-4 on its power play opportunities and took the lead through another power play goal with five minutes left in the first period.
Continuing the trend, Harvard scored on its next power play opportunity, with junior defenseman Danny Biega notching his second goal of the weekend in the opening seconds of the second period.
The Saints regained the lead halfway through the second another Martin goal–his second of the game–and despite sophomore defenseman Dan Ford's equalizer halfway through the third period, St. Lawrence took the lead for good with a goal from freshman Gunnar Hughes.
The loss makes the Crimson's record 1-1 on its weekend road trip.

While at Harvard, Derek M. Flanzraich '10 founded both On Harvard Time and HUTV. Last spring, he took his media career for a turn by starting Greatist, a health, fitness, and nutrition website.
"I tell most people I majored in 'Extracurriculars' at Harvard and that's basically true—my experience starting and building both On Harvard Time and HUTV taught me how much I loved to be a starter and a builder," Flanzraich said. "I learned how important it was for me to make a big, positive impact on a community."
The idea for Greatist developed out of "a frustration over the lack of quality health and fitness content on the web," according to David T. Tao '11, the site's editorial director.
The website includes tabs for fitness, health, and happiness, as well as an A-Z health guide. The articles feature scientific studies, nutritious recipes, and workout options, many of which are relevant to college students.
The Greatist staff has high expectations for the site. The company is working to build its own health and fitness web products while maintaining the quality of its online content. "We want the website to become one of the most visited and respected blogs in the world," Tao said.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: November 21, 2011. 
An earlier version of the Nov. 20 post "New Health Website 'Greatist'" misidentified the goals for the site. In fact, Greatist hopes to one day build personal health and fitness web products.

Gone are the days of vigorously shaking a ketchup bottle to no avail. The cleverly coined SLIPS  (Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surface)—a product created by Harvard University researchers that functions as a liquid-repellent—has recently come out with a new purpose: clearing out ketchup bottles. 
 
As the researchers explain, a bottle lined with SLIPS could dispense any condiment with fluidity, so a person effectively could use every single drop without waste. "It is a problem we all face—we have a bottle of sauce and we are trying to get the last bit out but nothing is happening," said materials science professor and project researcher Joanna Aizenberg, according to The Telegraph.
 
SLIPS isn't just for ketchup, however. The temperature and pressure stability of SLIPS makes it a good potential candidate for dealing with heating or refrigeration, and its ability to repel natural fluids means it can easily clean many surfaces, medical supplies, and even night-vision devices.
 
Flyby is particularly excited about the promising direction SLIPS is headed in the condiment domain. Inspired by the researchers' most recent idea, we've come up with five potential uses for SLIPS that we think will further the ingenuity of the product.
 
1) For use on any food from Felipe's. Finally a burrito that's not covered with grease. With SLIPS, the grease will be dripping right off.
2)  Try the product out on seals. Oil spills? No longer an issue for our blubber-bearing ocean friends.
3) Televisions. Now you can shower and watch "Grey's" at the same time.
4) Slip'‘n Slides. Faster is better. Apply SLIPS liberally over your body and proceed with caution. 
5) Tents. Rain while you're camping? No longer a problem. Also worth noting that the use of SLIPS may attract more occupiers to the Yard.
