After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two months after Tame Impala released their critically acclaimed album “Innerspeaker” in 2010, frontman Kevin Parker unexpectedly announced, “Album number two is nearing potential completion already.” However, the highly anticipated project stayed in development for two years. Now, Tame Impala has revealed “Lonerism,” a solid but somewhat anticlimactic sophomore album. While Parker once again displays his ear for melodies and ability to weld together sounds from different eras, this release lacks the compositional intricacy that made “Innerspeaker” exceptional.
Through despondent lyrics and lo-fi instrumentation, “Lonerism” very effectively ties all of its tracks back to its titular subject: the many emotions that accompany inescapable loneliness. On the introspective “Why Won’t They Talk To Me?,” Parker juxtaposes his defeated voice with restrained instrumentation, wondering, “Why won’t they talk to me? / I thought I was happy.” By the end of the album, he has resigned himself to his tragic fate, as he sings, “Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control” over a downtrodden, echoing groove.
“Lonerism” may be a lot weepier than “Innerspeaker,” but Parker’s exceptional ear for melody has not waned in the slightest. On “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards,” which features a grooving bassline and Parker’s characteristic wail, he surrounds harmonically unforgettable verses with an irresistibly catchy and frequently repeating chorus. The hazy production doesn’t overpower the music, and the track manages to be lazy and relaxed without dragging. On “Elephant,” which band member Jay Watson humorously but accurately proclaimed “really sexy” in an interview with Pitchfork, Tame Impala extends its melodic prowess to the instrumentation. An entire central section is devoted toward remarkable, interweaving lines on the organ, guitar, and synth lead. The counterpoint exhibited between the driving lines creates a wall of sound grounded by a simple but churning guitar riff.
However, other tracks feature walls of sound that are not nearly as well built as the one on “Elephant.” The album’s opener, “Be Above It,” features an unimaginative broken record effect that sinks in and out of the electro-texture. Ambient noises, snare drum echoes, and wah-ing guitars all creep in and out, giving the impression that the band wanted to create an opaque rather than coherent arrangement. Similarly uninspired are “Mind Mischief,” which ends with a repetitive, sweeping whooshing noise that distracts from the music itself, and “Keep On Lying,” which tries to fuel itself on a repetitive bassline and studio laughter but ultimately runs out of steam. The four-minute-long instrumental section of “Keep On Lying” is one of several points in the album at which the music seems to stagnate and lose its momentum.
Perhaps the most daring track appears at the end. The album’s coda, “Sun’s Coming Up,” is a drunken waltz which eventually devolves into an extended instrumental outro that may be best described as a drug-induced trip to the beach. The wobbly guitars and wave-like synthesizers that soak the outro are eerily reminiscent of surf rock. On this song, Tame Impala comes dangerously close to repeating their mistake of oversaturating their sound with synthesizers, but the song is instead an intricate soundscape, and it’s a relief to know that they are still willing to take risks.
In an interview with Pitchfork, Parker said of Tame Impala’s new release, “[Innerspeaker] was a lot more restrained—I kind of just didn’t see the point in holding back, basically. I was just like, you may as well… juice it.” And juice it they did. Some of the sounds and composition on “Lonerism” are unimaginative and overpowered by effects, but Parker’s melodic talent and thematic ideas shine through the occasional mishaps.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not many bands can claim they’ve played with a metalcore group, opened for a pop diva superstar, and backed a legendary rapper, all in the span of a few years. But Boston funk-metal-pop-punk-R&B band Bad Rabbits has ties to Ke$ha, Slick Rick, and Every Time I Die, and the group is perfectly happy with living way outside the box. “We don’t have a musical lane that we live in,” says guitarist Salim Akram. “We can play with the Wu-Tang Clan, and we can play on Warped Tour.”
Bad Rabbits, composed of Akram, singer Fredua “Dua” Boakye, drummer Sheel Davé, guitarist Santiago “Santi” Aruajo, and bassist Graham Masser, formed in 2007 while its members were playing in the 10-person band The Eclectic Collective. Since releasing their breakthrough EP “Stick Up Kids” in 2009, the group has built a significant following among fans of wildly different musical genres.
“People have told us we’re basically the go-to band for hardcore kids’ parties,” says Masser. Davé agrees, adding: “Metal bands tell us they play us in their vans, and we play metal in our vans…. It’s like, don’t shit where you eat. The type of music you play shouldn’t be the type of music you listen to.”
I meet Bad Rabbits at their rehearsal space on the second floor of the labyrinthine Brighton Sound Museum. After an hour waiting for them sitting among old, half-empty bottles of Busch Light and listening to what sounds like sitar thrash metal emanating out of a nearby room, I get a text from Akram: “Sorry, running a little behind.”
A little while later, Davé and Masser appear and unlock the band’s cramped rehearsal space. While we’re waiting for the rest of the band to show up, I talk to the two about the band’s upcoming releases. Bad Rabbits recently recorded two albums, one, “American Dream,” with New Jack Swing pioneer Teddy Riley, and another, “American Love,” with Bay Area producer Brad Lewis. “Love” is set to drop sometime in spring 2013; the band isn’t sure when “Dream” will be released. “They’re definitely different albums,” says Davé. “The Teddy Riley album sounds like a big R&B album, but the Brad Lewis is a futuristic funk, post-R&B rock album.”
Davé’s description may sound a little ridiculous, but that’s what it takes to do justice to Bad Rabbits’ sound. Boakye’s loud, soulful, and suggestive falsetto bears comparison to Prince and Abel Tesfaye a.k.a. The Weeknd, and he is backed by stomping, danceable punk-funk. Boakye partly attributes this unlikely combination to his musical upbringing.
“I grew up in the Pentecostal church and my mom made me sing in the choir. I guess that’s how I developed my vocal styling—the power and screaming came from gospel. Sly Stone was also a major influence. I heard ‘If You Want Me to Stay’ when I was 12 and always wanted to sing like him. After joining bands in high school, that’s where I got some of the punk influence. I stumbled upon hardcore punk band Bad Brains around that time and decided I wanted to be in a band like that,” Boakye recounts.
Once all the band members are there, they sit around and talk about details for their upcoming tour, but the discussion quickly moves into unrelated territory; topis covered include Honey Boo Boo, the attractiveness of Ice-T’s wife, and the band members’ first albums, which range from Green Day to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony to Radiohead.
After an hour of talking, the band starts rehearsing for their upcoming national tour with rapper P.O.S. by powering through upcoming single “We Can Roll,” a metal-influenced fist-pumper laced with Boakye’s pitch-perfect falsetto. While Bad Rabbits have an electric stage presence at their live shows, this rehearsal is laid-back and more focused on getting the sound right. Boakye even nonchalantly checks his iPhone while singing the chorus of “Booties.”
It quickly becomes evident that the band’s punk influence comes through even more on their live performances than on their studio releases. When asked about this stylistic adjustment, Masser nods his head.
“When we play live, we incorporate a lot more of the rock aesthetic. Sometimes it turns into a hardcore show. We’ll play songs from ‘Stick Up Kids,’ and people will start moshing to it.”
With this liberal attitude toward genre welding, Bad Rabbits encapsulate several musical themes of the 21st century. People across the world now have instant access to an unthinkable amount of music, and iTunes collections mean that dozens of genres can sit side by side. It isn’t too surprising, then, that a band like Bad Rabbits would come along and combine all of them.

If you can’t get enough of the Billboard charts, then you’re in luck! If you complain constantly about the state of pop music these days, then we’ve got the songs to prove you wrong. Crimson Arts brings you its monthly Singles Rundown, which covers the best recent singles in pop music of today.
“Take A Walk,” Passion Pit
Over the last few years, thousands of fans have come to love Passion Pit’s trademark energetic, synthesized sound. In “Take a Walk,” however, the group’s frenzied passion is toned down into a despairing narrative about a slowly collapsing family. The electronic instrumentation is the same, but this time it’s bound by a more rigid beat. Pounding bass drum and muted guitars make the song sound like a march, which parallels the lyrics about a man marching through his repetitive and desolate life.
“One More Night,” Maroon Five
Arguably the catchiest song of the season, “One More Night” is packed with enough “oohs” to leave hipsters shaking their heads but the rest of us singing along whenever we hear them on the radio. There’s nothing special or unique about this record—it’s pretty much “This Love, Part II”—but due to its infectious reggae-influenced beat, jittery guitar, and steamy vocals, it is no wonder that people everywhere are swooning to the rhythm for one more night.
“Diamonds,” Rihanna
If you are looking for another Rihanna power anthem featuring charged-up lyrics and dark, aggressive production, you won’t find it in “Diamonds.” The wild woman from “Loud” and “Talk that Talk” disappears as she compares her lover both to a “shooting star” and a “vision of ecstasy.” However, this stripped-down version of Rihanna allows us to better hear her vocal prowess. The delicate chorus highlights her voice, which was often walled up by heavy-handed synth and string parts in her past few albums. But like in past releases, the hook’s catchiness is undeniable and is one of the main things that ties her more passionate albums to this new, calmer self.
“Clique,” Kanye West
Over the past few months, tabloids have been catching Kanye West partying wildly with a new crew. In his new song “Clique,” he cements his group’s status as one of the most boisterous and talented in hip hop. Featuring Jay-Z and Big Sean, “Clique” begins with a sung intro that contemplates the implications of materialism. Yet when beat drops the focus shifts to partying and away from any deep thoughts on the consequences of their lifestyle. Big Sean gives his two cents on the issue: “Ain’t nobody fresher than my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique.”
While the song may not be lyrically powerful, its slick, bouncy production showcases exactly what many have come to love about Kanye. After Big Sean raps the chorus over a simple, bass-drum-driven beat, the track erupts with snare, strings, and an ominous chorus. This explosive transition is repeated three times, each one giving the song another boost of manic energy and creating a dynamic listening experience.

We have lost our republic. Congress, once a bastion of responsive democracy, is incoherent, coopted, and corrupted by the deluge of campaign finance from a small fraction of the super wealthy, unions, and corporations. Beholden to insidious special interests, our politicians now represent contributors rather than constituents.
“We’ve got a very unstable government because a tiny slice of the one percent fund elections,” said Lawrence L. Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. “That means that a tiny fraction of the tiny slice is enough to create influence to block substantial reform.”
The corruption of our vital institutions stemming from dependence on donors is widespread. It has metastasized to every conceivable area of public policy, from healthcare to defense to financial regulation. It is a critical problem in the country that, unless remedied, will stall progress in governance.
The campaign finance problem ought to be decidedly bipartisan. Who, on either side of the aisle, can justify billions of dollars in subsidies to enormously profitable oil companies? Or that six of the 400 wealthiest Americans paid no federal income tax?
The lightning rod of the campaign finance movement is the controversial Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling. The Supreme Court ruled that corporations and unions were entitled to unlimited independent political expenditures under the First Amendment. The ruling allowed for the creation of tax-exempt “social welfare” groups that can accept unlimited amounts but are not required to disclose donors. A ruling involving a nonprofit organization’s right to distribute a documentary was grossly extrapolated to the formation of these super PACs: “independent” entities that accept unlimited campaign donations from anyone: citizen, union, corporation, or foreign national.
“Multinational corporations decided to purchase the U.S. government. And they did so systematically, completely, and thoroughly. Citizens United was icing on the cake,” said Cenk K. Uygur, host of the progressive internet show The Young Turks.
But the right of the donor faction to devour American democracy is not universally reprimanded. “I think [Citizens United] liberated free speech. What you call a torrent of money, I call a torrent of speech. The more speech there is, the better,” said Nick Dranias, analyst at the Goldwater Institute.
But the notion of First Amendment rights through corporate personhood, promoted by the 1976 Supreme Court ruling Buckley v. Valeo, is as ludicrous as it is dismaying. Because corporations are driven by a fiduciary responsibility to increase profits for shareholders, the “speech” of corporations must always be aligned with this desire—corporate “persons” are incapable of humanity. Corporations neither live, love, nor die. Corporations aren’t endowed by their creator with inalienable rights because we, human beings, are the actual creators of such legal fictions.
“I don’t disagree that many of our institutions have been corrupted,” said Dranias. But Dranias proposes a problematic solution. “The root cause was that we just gave too much power to [regulatory agencies].” Instead, campaign finance is “best regulated in a decentralized fashion: through lawsuits, through each state figuring out what works best.”
Absent the shred of regulation that the FEC has over current elections, the already porous line between huge donors and politicians would dissolve into quid pro quo exchanges of money for commanding influence. Powerless to oppose the powers that be, the politician who represents constituents over the objections of donors would be quickly batted away under brutal salvos of opposing money. “You may have a disaster here and there,” Dranias later conceded. He can say that again.
Instead of resignedly firing our regulatory agencies, we must reverse our republic’s accelerating descent to a plutocracy. A constitutional amendment capping election donations, advocated by both Uygur and Lessig, is the most permanent prescription for the country’s ills.
Amendments to the U.S. Constitution are proposed through either Congress or an Article V convention called by state legislatures. Going the Congressional route “is very unlikely because Congress depends on the system as it is to create the incentives they want when they leave,” said Lessig. Relying on a complacent Congress for substantive change is impossible in a time when commonsense compromise no longer exists.
Many people get queasy at the thought of a “runaway” Article V convention, where organizers draft a radical revision of the Constitution. “I think Congress has the power to restrict the scope of the constitutional convention because if the constitutional convention exceeded the scope that Congress had set, then the fact that they had broken the rules would in most cases be fatal to any proposals that they advance,” said Lessig.
The problems of undue influence and institutional corruption through ineffective campaign finance law are the utmost threat to our democracy. The consensus among experts is clear: politicians are bought, and the system is broken. Luckily, the framers of the Constitution placed one weapon in the arsenal of the citizen to circumvent corrupted internal authorities and reform the system from the outside.
A constitutional amendment prohibiting corrupt money is critical. Dig in for an arduous campaign: it is time for us to recapture our lost republic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, is a remarkable individual by any measure. The first woman to be elected president of her country, her tenure has seen the enactment of the first same-sex marriage law on the continent and the establishment of a Ministry of Science, Technology, and Productive Innovation. She’s been a forceful leader, unafraid to make controversial decisions in the face of strong opposition.
However, the choices she makes are increasingly the wrong ones. And the cause of this seems to be personal, not political.
Nowhere was this more on display than at the talk that President Kirchner offered at the Harvard Kennedy School on September 27, where she delivered an address and took questions from the audience. The event was highly anticipated, given that Kirchner usually spurns attempts by journalists to ask questions. She seems to have a vitriolic dislike of journalists in general. When one student remarked that, under the circumstances, he felt fortunate to talk to her, she dismissively replied, “You can’t repeat what two or three journalists write.” Well, journalists point out the truth. That’s more or less their job. Judging by Kirchner’s actions, which have severely curbed freedom of the press in Argentina, that’s not something she’s comfortable with.
Let’s get back to the talk, however. At first, I was pleased to have landed a front-row seat, giving me an unobstructed view of President Kirchner. When the question-and-answer session started, however, I quickly wished I were someplace else. The manner in which she responded to pointed, critical queries made me cringe in my seat, and I’m sure I wasn’t alone. Following some of her statements, the entire room let out a gasp, as if to express, “She did not just say that.”
One audience member, who identified himself as an Argentine student at the Kennedy School, asked Kirchner why Colombia and other regional neighbors are capable of economic growth without currency controls, while Argentina’s economy is stagnant with such measures in place. Currency controls do, in fact, exist in Argentina, and they are a serious cause of concern for many members of Argentine society. These days, the real estate market in Buenos Aires is basically paralyzed, as properties cannot be bought and sold in dollars—only the notoriously unstable peso.
So how did President Kirchner respond to this student? “We’re at Harvard. Come on, please. Those things are not from Harvard,” she sentenced, her voice dripping with exasperation. In her view, since this particular Argentine studies abroad and has access to dollars, he had no right to pose such a question. “You think you can really talk about these currency problems?”
To call her response disrespectful would be a euphemism. Whether this young man lives abroad or not is irrelevant—as an Argentine citizen, he has the right and duty to express concern about an issue that impacts his family, his friends, and his country at large. This aside, however, the president’s abrupt dismissal of his question by means of an ad hominem attack suggests something about the way her intellect functions. Kirchner’s initial reaction to any criticism—her only reaction, perhaps—is emotional rather than rational. She’s an intelligent woman; she was perfectly capable of a well-reasoned, respectful response to the question. Yet she felt the immediate need to assert her power rather than justify the way she’s using it.
Need another example? When another student asked if Argentina’s economic and security woes meant it was time for some self-criticism, she sarcastically said she expected better questions from an Ivy League audience. Once again, Kirchner turned a constructive debate into negative mudslinging.
I don’t mean to draw my conclusions solely from one public appearance. Rather, this event merely confirmed the media’s portrayal of President Kirchner as a testy, autocratic populist. Many Argentines joke that their country is a “dedocracy,” from the Spanish word for finger, because her fingerprints are on every government action. She has surrounded herself with a small circle of laughably incompetent advisors, providing herself with an environment in which no one contests her final word. Kirchner actually spent most of the summer waging what many perceive as a campaign of vendetta against Daniel O. Scioli, the popular governor of the province of Buenos Aires, who suggested that he might compete in the next presidential elections. Ironically, he belongs to the same political party as her.
This, then, is the image of herself that President Kirchner left us with at Harvard. Arrogant? Certainly. Narcissistic? Don’t doubt it. Megalomaniac? That might be going a bit too far, but she’s certainly on the right track.
The irony of my position isn’t lost on me—I’m criticizing President Kirchner in personal terms for her personal attacks on others. The problem is that, for Kirchner, the political and the personal are no longer separate. Until she learns that they are, she’ll capsize her country along with her personal reputation.

I get it. In the idiom of current college students, “incest” has come to mean romance among hall-mates or house-mates. Kirkland House’s annual dance, IncestFest, is a catchy name designed to celebrate a saccharinely close-knit house. It’s easy to become habituated to the name, lulled into prioritizing the slang meaning of “incest” over its formal definition.
But let’s talk about incest for a minute. Actual incest.
According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, in one year about 126,000 children are victims of either substantiated or indicated sexual abuse. 93 percent of these victims know their attacker; 34.2 percent of child victims are attacked by a family member.
If sexual assault can have long-lasting and pernicious effects—survivors are three times more likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, 13 times more likely to abuse alcohol, and four times more likely to contemplate suicide than the average person—incest is especially heinous. Childhood survivors often believe that they are the guilty party or that the relationship was somehow consensual, because both of these beliefs are less painful than acknowledging the culpability of their parent. In an article on CNN, psychotherapist Joanne Zuchetto explains, “They carry this belief that they may have flirted, that they may have worn a bikini, all this stuff makes them feel, ‘I’m not really innocent.’” It can take five to seven years in continual therapy to heal from such an experience.
Worse still is the invisibility of the problem. Sexual assault is a notoriously underreported and under-prosecuted crime, especially when its victims are children, one of the most vulnerable groups in American society. Meanwhile, the narrative of incest as a horrific crime against an innocent child is not necessarily the dominant one.
On the one hand, incest is seen as sexy and titillating, one of the final taboos left in an era of Fifty Shades of Grey. In a 1997 article, the New York Times described incest as “the sudden Zeitgeist zapping a jaded American audience,” and in a 2011 article on Salon.com, Tracy Clark-Flory points out that four recent shows—“Dexter,” “Boardwalk Empire,” “Game of Thrones,” and “Bored to Death”—have introduced happy incest plotlines because they evoke “the right amount of horror to keep us interested.” Relationships between half-siblings are even more common; “Pretty Little Liars” and Cruel Intentions, for example, both feature villainous women seducing half-brothers.
There is one point I must emphasize: the vast majority of cases of incest are not between two consensual adults. Generally a father is exploiting a daughter or an older sibling is exploiting a younger sibling. Even if we bracket issues of age, supposedly “egalitarian” or “happy incest families” cannot exist: the power differential between father and daughter or older sibling and younger sibling is so huge that it necessarily precludes the possibility of consent. The sexy siblings on TV and the image of the oppressed pedophile are lies that distract from a silent epidemic raging throughout the world.
I am writing all this to explain that I am not only objecting to the name “IncestFest” because it is offensive and insensitive—although, indeed, it is, and it saddens me that this is not immediately obvious. I am writing this because incest is notoriously invisible and leaves its victims burdened with shame and humiliation for the rest of their lives. This invisibility and this shame are directly enforced by the myths of incest as “sexy” and “misunderstood”—myths propagated by using “incest” as slang for “sex with someone I’m living with” and by dances that institutionalize this meaning. The name “IncestFest” is not sexy or cute or clever. It’s dangerous.
The denizens of Kirkland House are quirky, intelligent, and sensitive. We can do better than this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To those lamenting the lack of social space on campus: the end of your wait may be in sight. Last week, the administration made its first commitment to the establishment of a student center. Heeding the recommendations of the Common Spaces Initiative, President Drew G. Faust said she has strongly considered including a student center as part of the upcoming capital campaign, and once a donor is found, the administration would move forward on the project. We have previously opined on the dearth of dedicated student space at Harvard. On a campus in which property is as scarce as it is valuable, a student center will be a welcome addition to the Harvard Square landscape, giving the student body some much needed social space. Crucially, a student center will also help dispel the notion that the only available social spaces are those owned by organizations unaffiliated with and unaccountable to the university.
It is readily apparent that there is a glaring lack of dedicated student space that is both accessible and spacious. Locations like Lamont library and the Greenhouse Café have partially filled the void, while many students have grown accustomed to spending their spare time in individual House facilities and dining halls. However, this dynamic has only contributed to the fragmented nature of social life at Harvard. With the exception of Annenberg, there is no single location on campus capable of holding a large swath of one class at any one time. For this reason alone, a prospective student center is all the more encouraging.
Although Faust has offered few details and fewer formal commitments, one of the most promising aspects of the student center is that it will be likely located in what is currently Holyoke Center. The Student Organization Center at Hilles, Harvard’s prior attempt at a student center, never made it big because of its location; its primary failing was a lack of proximity to Harvard Yard, the geographic center of campus. Although well furnished and convenient for both quadlings and student organizations, the SOCH is too distant to accommodate much of the student body. Placing a student center in the middle of Harvard Square makes likely its success as a popular location; students can look forward to a dedicated space just close enough to everything that it will serve a myriad of uses.
Most importantly, by building this student center, Harvard will move closer to creating a social environment not dominated by the same few players—final clubs, fraternities, and property-owning organizations. Hopefully, this will help break the culture of exclusivity and lack of safety that have come to define much of Harvard’s social experience. Although not be the last word on the issue of social space, a student center will hopefully provide additional venues in which students can hold events and parties, enriching a social scene crippled by a lack of diverse weekend options. Of course, as with all projects of this nature, the devil is in the details; we hope the administration will make these spaces readily available to student organizations, without the bureaucratic hassle that prevents groups from using other campus spaces.
It remains unclear exactly what the student center will look like, but Faust’s commitment to expanding student space is a critical first step. We only hope that her stated goal and reality will match up.

Native Americans at Harvard College commemorated indigenous cultures that existed before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas with candles at their Candle Held Vigil on Monday.
Around forty students and members of the Harvard community gathered outside Matthews Hall to remember the impact of indigenous people in history and to advocate for the University to change the name of the holiday.
“We hold [the vigil] every year to remember where we came from in the past,” said April A. Sperry ’13, the secretary of NAHC. “I think it’s important to remember where we came from and where we’re going.”
Cesareo Alvarez ’13, the president of NAHC, welcomed the attendees and asked for everyone to introduce themselves before leading the group in a moment of silence and reflection on the history of indigenous peoples in the Americas.
Alvarez said that NAHC’s goal is to get the University to change the name of the holiday, calling it “Fall Weekend” or “Indigenous People’s Day” like some other universities.
“Columbus Day isn’t universally celebrated on campus,” he said. “This day misrepresents--distorts--our history.”
Alvarez said he hopes that NAHC can join with the Latino community in the college to make their voice on the issue heard.
Sperry said that changing the name of the holiday in the University would make it more inclusive of indigenous people.
“By calling it Columbus Day, I think people forget that indigenous people were here first and remain here,” she said.
L. Fay Alexander ’14, who came to support her friends at the vigil, also said that she would like to see the University change the name of the day.
“Hopefully the University will take note of groups like NAHC that wish for them to just change the name of the day and respect the culture,” she said.
Shelly C. Lowe, the executive director of the Harvard University Native American Program, explained to the crowd that the event was held outside of Matthews Hall because in 1996 alumni placed a plaque on the building that commemorates the 1650 Charter, which called for the education of both Native American and English students.
Alvin H. Warren, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, closed the vigil with a prayer. After the vigil, the attendees walked together to Winthrop house and gathered to socialize and eat fry bread, a traditional Navajo Native American food.

The Harvard Alumni Association announced last Thursday the remaining members of the Senior Class Committee, a microcosm of the Class of 2013 that includes best friends, students who had never met before, as well as six House Committee co-chairs.
The newly elected committee members—Francis G. Thumpasery ’13 who will serve as secretary, Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 who will serve as treasurer, and Liora N. Simozar ’13 who will serve as webmaster—will join the eight class marshals  and 13 House Representatives in planning senior social activities this year, including Senior Week and Class Day.
The HAA also announced the five members of the Senior Gift Committee who will spearhead fundraising efforts for the senior gift: Lillian M. Kivel ’13, Gresa Matoshi ’13, Schuyler A. Milender ’13, Catherine E. Williams ’13, and Danni Xie ’13.
The Senior Committee, with the exception of the Senior Gift Committee, met for the first time last Wednesday. Nina M. Yancy ’13, who was elected as the first class marshal by her classmates in mid-September, said she was surprised by the “incredible creativity” displayed by the committee members during the first meeting.
“Since everyone is so excited for their jobs, I don’t think we will have any trouble getting along,” Yancy said.
The entire group, including the Senior Gift Committee, will meet for the first time this Wednesday.
Members of the Senior Committee said they look forward to bringing the senior class together during the months preceding graduation, as well as in the years after they receive their diplomas.
Thumpasery, a Crimson multimedia editor, said he is excited to help make senior year special for members of the class of 2013. He hopes to strengthen the bond of the class by providing opportunities for effective communication amongst seniors.
“There are many exciting things we can do as a class, and we’re going to enjoy senior year,” Thumpasery said, adding that these events will help the class grow closer as a community.
Alissa N. Changala ’13, a Dunster House Committee co-chair, also said she was excited to plan events for Senior Week and to reach out to different communities on campus.
As the only senior from Dunster who ran for the Senior Class Committee, Changala said she hopes to prolong the sense of community the House system fosters into adulthood.
“When you graduate college, the things that people ask are, ‘When did you graduate and what House were you?’” Changala said. “When people think of Dunster, I want them to remember good memories and be proud to be in Dunster.”
Matoshi, one of five Senior Gift co-chairs, said she is looking forward to how she can give back to the College even after graduation.
Matoshi said that she is grateful for the financial opportunities and resources the College provides and believes that serving as a member of the Senior Gift Committee would be the best way to contribute to Harvard community.
Though members of the Committee expressed different motivations for serving as leaders of the senior class, all the individuals interviewed for this story agreed they are looking forward to bringing the senior class together this year.
“This is our time,” webmaster Simozar said. “And I’m excited to make it fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Club of Boston is considering selling its “annex,” the building that sits to the right of the main clubhouse on Commonwealth Ave. in the Back Bay, according to the Club’s president, Nicholas J. Iselin ’87.
The annex contains 17 of the Club’s overnight rooms, a library, administrative offices, the Back Bay Room, and the Boston Room, which is the Club’s main dining room.
The Club, which is open to graduates of Harvard and other “selected affiliate colleges and universities,” according to its website, is a private business that is not affiliated with Harvard University.
Iselin said that in the event of a sale, the Club would keep the Back Bay room and Boston room, the part of the annex that is most used by members. Other than this stipulation, the impact of the sale on the Club depend on the agreement with the buyers.
“We’re going to do everything we can to safeguard the needs of the club,” Iselin said.
Several of the Club’s board members declined to comment on the potential sale.
Iselin said there is a “pretty good” chance of the sale happening, partly because he thought that demand for the real estate would be high.
“What I know of the Back Bay real estate market...suggests that there will be an appetite for what we’re selling,” Iselin said.
Last month, the Harvard Club settled a lawsuit filed by its wait staff alleging that the Club violated the Massachusetts “tip law.” The Club agreed to pay $4 million as a result of the suit.
“The annex has been under consideration to leverage capital for a long time,” Iselin said, adding that while the lawsuit’s settlement “certainly drives home the need for raising capital,” considering selling the annex is not a response to the suit.
Iselin said that he had received a “mixed bag” of feedback from members about selling the annex, but that there was a “productive discussion” taking place.
“Our members are not shy about expressing their opinions, and I’ve gotten a lot of opinions,” Iselin said.
In an Oct. 3 letter to Club members, Iselin addressed some of the concerns and suggestions that had been voiced by members about selling what he called the “underutilized annex space.”
First, Iselin wrote that using the parking lot to raise funds was not a viable alternative to selling the annex, as Boards of Governors have explored the possibility for 40 years, and, “ultimately, the math has not worked.” Additionally, lack of a parking lot would inconvenience members and negatively impact revenue from functions at the Club.
Second, Iselin responded to the suggestion that capital be supplemented by an increase in dues by writing that the increase that would be necessary is impractical and would contradict the Club’s guiding principles of inclusiveness and affordability.
Third, Iselin addressed the concern that losing the annex would lead to a decrease in revenue from overnight rooms and said that the annex rooms are among the Club’s “least attractive,  hardest to maintain, and hardest to rent.” He wrote that the rooms are utilized at a rate of only 55 percent and that, largely due to the recession, the Club’s most serious revenue challenge is because of decreased revenue from functions.
“In this climate, we will not make up ground without some significant changes in this mix,” Iselin wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 200 students, professionals, and academics from across the country arrived at Harvard on  Saturday to attend the 3rd Annual Igniting Innovation Summit on social entrepreneurship.
“The purpose [of the summit] is to expose undergraduate students and members of the community to the contract of social entrepreneurship and to explore the idea that doing well and doing good are not mutually exclusive,” said summit co-chair Bari C. Saltman ’14, who is also a Crimson editor.
The summit is the largest undergraduate-run social entrepreneurship event at Harvard, lasting a total of 11 hours. This year’s theme was “Voice Your Passion” and featured 4 TED-style talks, 12 panel discussions, 6 self-expression workshops, and an innovation showcase by 53 leader-innovators.
“The idea is to ignite dialogue about our passions and aspirations to act and make an impact through people’s voices”, said past summit chair Kara M. Kubarych ’13. “It’s easy to want to do something but it’s harder to start the conversation and take action. The purpose of the summit is to spur people to take action and give them a forum to start conversation.”
The speakers varied in their fields and in the focus of their presentations. Andrew Slack, this year’s keynote speaker at the Nobel Peace Prize Forum, said he was inspired by his love of Harry Potter books to “fight the Dark Arts in the real world” and founded a human rights activist group called The Harry Potter Alliance.
“In the book, Harry Potter starts Dumbledore’s army to fight injustice,” he said. “If Harry Potter lived in our world, he would start something similar to fight injustices like the genocide in Darfur and global warming.”
The summit attracted students interested in social entrepreneurship from other universities, as well. Eren Shultz traveled to Harvard from Clinton, New York with two other students from Hamilton College to attend the conference after reading about it in the Wall Street Journal.
“You have an amazing array of talented speakers. Other schools can’t facilitate something of this scale,” he said. “I hope that Harvard would reach out more to other schools, engage them, invite their students so they can make use of this fantastic resource.”
Since its inception in 2010, the Igniting Innovation conference has ballooned in the diversity of its speakers and the scope of its impact.
“Initially the summit was conceived as a way to connect people who already had business plans for social enterprises,” Saltman said. “Since then we’ve tried to expand our audience and appeal to students who aren’t even familiar with the field of social entrepreneurship, but are interested in career paths beyond finance and consulting.”
This year also saw the addition of two new events. The first is the Social Venture Challenge, a competition in which three winning teams will receive $3,000 to use towards the execution of their proposed social ventures. The second is the Eat for Equity Dinner, a fundraising dinner that benefits The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, an organization that provides entrepreneurial training to low-income youth.

Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article stated that the theme of the 2012 Igniting Innovation Summit was “Follow Your Passion.” In fact, it was “Voice Your Passion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard football team’s 13-game winning streak, now the longest in Division I football, Saturday’s win over Cornell was the most impressive yet.
Sure, the 45-7 romp of Yale in last year’s Game raised some eyebrows. The 41-10 trouncing of Dartmouth a year ago was a dominant display of football. And yes, the 52-3 embarrassment of Holy Cross a week ago was stunning.
For the first 12 games of its streak, though, the Crimson had only blown out far weaker teams, teams that everyone knew Harvard was going to beat. These teams were a class below the Crimson, lightweights competing against the heavyweight champ. We all knew that Harvard was going to win those contests; it was just a question of by how much.
But that was one streak that did end on Saturday. Facing a Big Red squad that was supposed to threaten for a league crown, Harvard seemed oblivious. When the clock struck midnight, the Crimson had somehow crushed the highly hyped Big Red, 45-13.
Granted, the contest was perhaps closer than the score indicates. Coming into the half, the Crimson only held an 11-point advantage, and Cornell seemed to be gaining steam.
But that trend proved to be quite short-lived. Harvard hit its stride once again and well, that was that. The Crimson high-stepped to yet another victory with yet another 21-point fourth quarter, and what had been billed as a tight prize fight became a blowout, an exhibition of Harvard dominance.
This wasn’t supposed to happen, right? What about junior quarterback Jeff Mathews, the reigning Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, the guy with laser accuracy and an NFL release? Wasn’t he supposed to rip up a Crimson secondary that had looked dangerously fragile in Weeks One and Two?
Harassed by a nightmare-inducing Crimson defensive line, Mathews faced unrelenting pressure and was hurried all afternoon.
When he did manage to get a throw off, the Harvard secondary did more than enough to slow down the Big Red attack. Of course, it didn’t help Mathews’ cause that his best wide receiver from a year ago, Shane Savage, didn’t play.
Okay, well how about Cornell’s defense? Wasn’t it supposed to be far better than that porous Big Red D that gave up 41 points to Harvard a year ago?
Sure, its defense has improved. In its previous two contests, Cornell had allowed just eight points per game.
But with the Crimson’s juggernaut offense clicking, with all those pistons firing in seemingly perfect harmony, no one has had an answer in, oh, over a year.
However you dissect the result, this much, though, is clear: Saturday was an uh-oh game for the rest of the Ivy League.
If Cornell can’t come close to stopping Harvard, who can?
But for Ancient Eight foes, another question looms as well.
Is this year’s Crimson team—wait for it—better than last year’s, that team that rolled unscathed through Ivy League play?
No, “come on,” you might say. Think about everyone Harvard lost to graduation.
Quarterback Collier Winters ’11, defensive player of the year Josue Ortiz ’11, its three top wide receivers, its best linebacker, its top cornerback—the list goes on. There’s no way.
The numbers tell a different story. A year ago, the Crimson had scored 118 points and allowed 71.
This year’s team? A dizzying 170 points—that’s comes out to 42.5 per game—and just 60 against. (By comparison, Princeton scored 174 points the entire 2011 season).
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple has looked as dominant as he did in 2011.
A broken record of good throws and good decisions, Chapple boasts 11 touchdowns to two interceptions while completing 67.5 percent of passes. At this pace, the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year accolade may be coming to Cambridge.
But while Chapple is perhaps the most integral part of the Harvard football team’s success, far be it that he is the sole reason that this Harvard team is so dominant, so downright scary. No, the explanation for that is the not-so-secret ingredient of Harvard football: ridiculous, jaw-dropping, are-you-kidding-me depth.
Because on Saturday, the Crimson arsenal was missing a number of its most dangerous weapons. Two of its top receivers are out, as is a star running back.
Center Jack Holuba was gone, right tackle Will Whitman is done for the year, and the team’s top cornerback, Brian Owusu, was also sidelined.
Yet Harvard did as Harvard does—filled those spots with more-than-able replacements and just kept winning. Blindfolded and with its legs tied, the Crimson still delivered the knockout punch against perhaps the second best team in the conference.
Nearly halfway through the season, with Harvard looking more unbeatable than ever, a league championship appears ever more likely. But more than that, this could—and, frankly, should—be the first Crimson team since the Ryan Fitzpatrick Era to go undefeated, perfect, 10-0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penalty corners were the Harvard field hockey team’s downfall in Sunday’s loss to Bucknell at Jordan Field.
The Bison doubled the Crimson in penalty corners, taking 12 to the Harvard’s six. And while Bucknell made Harvard pay by scoring two of their three scores off of corners, the Crimson went zero for six, and the Bison emerged with a 3-1 victory.
“They weren’t dominating us by any means,” co-captain midfielder Kim Goh said. “A couple of corners we didn’t even think should be called, so that was a bit sticky…. But there’s very little you can do to control that portion of the game.”
The Crimson (3-8, 1-2 Ivy) went into halftime down, 2-0, failing to find the cage on any of its seven first-half shots.
Harvard scored early in the second frame, but the Bison (8-6, 2-0 Patriot) kept their opponent off the board the rest of the way.
“I think we had build-up at times but we still need to work on consistency,” Goh said.
After being held scoreless for the first 42 minutes, the home team was finally able to capitalize when sophomore midfielder Sydney Jenkins sent in a long bouncing ball for junior forward Rachael Rosenfeld, who tipped it into the cage.
“I was just down in the circle and saw Sydney winding up, and I was like, ‘gotta tap it, gotta tap it,’” Rosenfeld said.
The Crimson seemed to be on the comeback, as Harvard co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos followed with three straight saves in goal, and Harvard continued to send shots at the Bison goal.
“I think we did well with passing inside the midfield and getting the ball up to the circle,” Rosenfeld said. “We just need to finish more.”
The Crimson’s closest chance came off a Goh penalty stroke that hit the side bar and bounced out.
“We were a little unlucky in the second half,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “I still feel we are a little more reacting, which means more than often we will be too late, instead of anticipating.”
Bucknell sealed the win when senior midfielder Kelly Stefanowicz scored off a penalty corner in the final three minutes for her second goal of the game.
Stefanowicz opened the scoring in the 18th minute off a penalty corner. The senior registered a shot that deflected off the leg pads of a diving Tassopoulos to put the Bison up, 1-0.
Bucknell struck again just seconds before the break when Leigh Hillman deflected a shot into the goal.
A bright spot for the Crimson was the defensive play of back Rebecca Houser, a junior who missed her first two seasons due to injury,
“Rebecca Houser played very well,” van Herwaarden said. “She’s in a tough role not always playing as much, and I think she stepped up.  Her team needed her today, and I think she did very well.”
With five games remaining—four of which are against Ivy League opponents—Harvard still believes it has room to grow.
“We are in a process,” van Herwaarden said. “We need to make…sure that we are able to play this game faster, a little better, more secure in our reception and passing, and just overall grow.”
“We still don’t feel like we’re really showing off what we can do yet,” Goh said. “So being mentally ready is always the thing we’re trying to work on."

Friday morning, at 0:07 hours, something very significant happened: Adele released a song that wasn't about a break-up. Actually, it's the theme song to the new James Bond movie, "Skyfall." And it's really good. You can listen to it here.
Beginning with a burst of Bond-appropriate horns, the song quickly takes up a tense piano line. "This is the end," Adele sings, and you can almost see the iconic silhouettes of the Bond girls changing colors and climbing out of pistols. The first chorus features a tremendous, reaching melody line that recalls the "Goldfinger" theme. Afterwards, Adele sings the refrain, the 77-piece orchestra plays Bond's indelible minor theme, and a surf guitar pulls the groove back to the verse. The song churns on at an unshakeable pace, building and falling with each chorus.
In recent years, the Bond songs have slipped a bit. The filmmakers have made odd choices of pop stars, often trading the strings for harder sounds. Alicia Keys and Jack White came up short with their plodding "Another Way to Die," which was exactly one half Jack White, one half Alicia Keys, and all misplaced effort; both were trying far too hard, and the result is a slog of a song. Chris Cornell's "Casino Royale" song "You Know My Name" had a killer lick and a memorable chorus, but it was too hard rock for its own good. The classic Bond songs didn’t seem to try for glory—like the man they celebrate, they achieved nonchalance with class. Adele's retro leanings and rich voice make her a perfect fit for this now-nostalgic elegance. It's no small feat that, in a pantheon that includes "Goldfinger," "You Only Live Twice," "Diamonds are Forever," and "Live and Let Die." Adele's "Skyfall" holds its own.
