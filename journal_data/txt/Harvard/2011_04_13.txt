After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Money spent on international development is often easier allocated than well spent. Madonna’s non-profit recently collapsed after mismanaging millions of dollars. Bono’s ONE foundation was criticized last year for donating little more than one percent of the 9.6 million Euros it raised in 2008—and for spending more than 5.1 million Euros on staff salaries. In the UK, millions of taxpayer pounds were wasted on poorly constructed wells in Afghanistan, even after earlier internal government reports had warned that the projects would likely fail.
Despite these initiatives’ good intentions, the lack of transparency about their operations has led to public dismay and, more importantly, a failure to create substantive positive change in the communities they seek to help. Unfortunately, such misrepresentation in the sphere of social change and development happens more often than we would like to think.
Madonna’s non-profit, Raising Malawi, crumbled in March when news broke that the organization had spent $3.8 million to build a girls’ school that never came to fruition. A recent report by the Global Philanthropy Group stated that the organization had mismanaged funds and could not account for some of the money that had been spent. It also alleged that funds had been used to pay for a golf club membership for the incoming head of the school. This financial fiasco was both disrespectful to donors and deleterious to the community, as the organization has failed to bolster education there.
While this was a particularly egregious case, less obvious instances of misstating a project’s mission or accomplishments are still surprisingly common. Often, organizations don’t blatantly embezzle or misuse money, but they use it inefficiently or misrepresent their activities to the public. According to the website CharityNavigator.com, which rates American charities based on their financial management, many charities spend over 50 cents to raise one dollar. Similarly, non-profits like Bono’s sometimes spend significantly more on operations than on doing good. Using such large proportions of donated funds for purposes other than directly doing good misleads donors who are told they are investing in projects that will create social impact.
This is not to say that non-profits mask their inefficiencies and errors out of bad intentions. Rather, non-profits feel pressure to produce positive outcomes. In today’s philanthropy sector, claiming positive results is rewarded, while admitting mistakes can damage an organization’s support network and funding prospects. This fundamental feature of the social change sector incentivizes misreporting of activities and outcomes. For example, a report on the Hewlett Foundation’s Neighborhood Improvement Initiative notes that even when the program had yet to make tangible positive change at its three sites, “Hewlett staff felt great pressure to demonstrate positive results.”
The disincentive to be honest in social change projects can undermine the social mission of these efforts themselves. By masking the realities of tough situations, we will miss genuine opportunities to make a real change. For instance, had the United Kingdom’s government acknowledged the unfeasibility of the Afghanistan wells project early on, it might have tweaked the project strategy or spent the money on more effective interventions, such as the successful microfinance and schools programs it started in the region.
Honestly admitting mistakes is difficult in the social change sphere, but it can yield insights that will bolster future initiatives. When the Hewlett Foundation admitted that its community development initiative in West Oakland “self-destructed,” it took the opportunity to go beyond the typical “finger pointing” associated with such acknowledgements and instead reflected on the project, using its insights to help improve the Foundation’s other project sites. In another instance, FORGE, a non-profit that helps refugees in Africa, admitted that it was facing a $100,000 budget shortfall in 2008 because it had ended a program that had asked student volunteers to raise $5,000 each to work with the refugees. By publicly sharing its embarrassing misstep, the organization actually attracted donations that helped alleviate its financial problems.
Ann, a university student who ran youth leadership workshops in Uganda, openly shared her mistakes in first imposing American ideas in the program design rather than empowering local peer educators early on to make a difference in their own communities. Her insight could benefit the many students who travel to foreign countries and run projects to help the communities there.
We can learn much from organizations and individuals that already discuss honestly the good and the bad aspects of their projects. Not only can we glean insights perhaps applicable to our own endeavors, but we can also find the inspiration and precedent to be more transparent about our own work for social change.
It is critical that we work towards creating a culture that encourages and rewards transparency in philanthropy and social entrepreneurship. Only then can we begin to avoid the inefficiencies and damage done by floundering projects striving to cover up their mistakes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the most recent round of budgetary brinkmanship, had the federal government indeed shut down last Friday at midnight there would be at least one piece of silver lining: We might have finally been able to put the Tea Party philosophy to rest once and for all by exposing its fundamental fallacies.
Had the two parties failed to reach a compromise before the deadline, this week could have been a preview of a Tea Party golden age. We would have awoken to an America in which the “non-essential” parts of the federal government were comatose.
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security payouts would have grinded to a halt during a government shutdown. No fuss, no muss. The entitlement programs that are so vilified by Tea Party types would no longer exist. Easier this way than through the death by a thousand cuts and privatizations currently being pursued in Paul Ryan’s long-term budget proposal, no?
Enforcement of environmental regulations so often derided by Glenn Beck types would vanish just like that. In 1995, the last time a budget impasse created a government shutdown, over 600 toxic waste clean-ups were stopped cold in their tracks. No more would your hard-earned tax dollars have to pay to clean hazardous substances from our purple mountains majesty!
During a government shutdown, it would be impossible to get a passport or visa processed, so good luck getting out of the country. But who would really want to leave America during its crippled state anyway, other than some draft-dodging, long-haired, hippie Socialists? Plus, all those furloughed government workers could use their newfound free time, as John McCain would say, to “complete the danged fence.” Might as well fence off California while we’re at it.
Of course, the essential parts of our federal government would persevere in this government-shutdown utopia. The continuing resolution that postponed the true budget showdown for one more week also funded the military through the following fiscal year. The military would continue, strong as ever, although the  soldiers wouldn’t get paid. Since providing for the national defense is one of the very few roles that the Tea Party dream government would play, almost completely shutting down the government would make it just the right size!
The hypothetical is extreme, but this reductio ad absurdum just goes to show how, well, absurd the Tea Party platform is when considered in real world terms. It is completely defensible to believe in a smaller government, in fiscal conservatism, and other planks of the platform that have been shouted so many times before and since the November elections. But many of the demagogues—I’m looking at you, Michelle Bachmann and both Rand and Ron Paul—who portray spending and the national debt as a pending apocalypse and an emaciated federal government as the ideal are misguided.
No one wanted the government to shut down last Friday. But many who fully subscribe to the Tea Party philosophy want just about the same thing done—just at a slower pace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Do you remember where you were and what you were doing when you received the news that you had been admitted to Harvard?  Many alumni carry this memory with them for the rest of their lives.  On March 30, 2158 students from a record applicant pool of nearly 35,000 received this news.  You can help them think through this pivotal decision in their lives.
We hope you will join many of your classmates in working with us and the faculty to congratulate our admitted students on all they have accomplished and welcome them into our community.  Time and again over the years, we have heard from students that coming in April to Visitas (the weekend devoted to admitted students), or conversing with undergraduates and faculty over the telephone, or via email, blogs or message boards was a critical factor in their decision to choose Harvard.
It is all too easy in busy lives filled with midterms, meetings, athletic practices, senior theses, and other obligations to neglect to take time to reflect.  No matter where you are in your Harvard career—from those of you celebrating your new House assignment and looking forward to leaving Harvard Yard next year to those of you who will return to Harvard Yard in commencement regalia in the coming weeks—we hope you’ll stop to remember where you were when you received that letter and think about how you’ve changed since then.  Think about the risks you’ve taken, the professors who have inspired you, the lessons you’ve learned through all of the failures and victories, and above all the relationships you’ve built and friendships that you will carry with you well beyond your undergraduate years. And if, when you take the time to reflect, you feel a sense of gratitude to this community, we hope you might consider giving back, in honor Harvard’s investment in you.
There are many ways for current students to contribute now and in the future: Our admissions process relies heavily on the volunteer efforts of students and alumni who devote their time and energy to Harvard.  This coming month we need your help with several projects. You can assist the Undergraduate Admissions Council, the Undergraduate Minority Recruiting Program, and the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative in reaching out to students during April and throughout the year.  You can help extracurricular organizations plan their events, open houses, and performances for Visitas. These activities showcase the amazing talent, diversity, and vitality of our students.  They capture the inclusive spirit of Harvard and reassure the newly admitted class that everyone has a place here.  Lastly, you can help this month by offering a friendly and welcoming face to newly admitted students whenever and wherever you encounter them.
During the rest of the year, you can join the many classmates who work with the UAC, UMRP, and HFAI hosting visiting students and contacting prospective students to interest them in applying to Harvard—especially those who might not normally consider Harvard a possibility.  You can take part in our Return to High School Program.  This is especially important over the next few months as we prepare to return to Early Action next year and encourage students from all backgrounds to apply early.  We hope more of you will be able to visit high schools when you return home this spring, before you return to Harvard in August, or on breaks throughout the year. You can also join our corps of student greeters and tour guides, who speak during our Cambridge information sessions and tours for the many students and parents who visit Harvard.
For those of you graduating this spring, we hope you will consider becoming an alumni interviewer for our applicants.  We are grateful to the 12,000 alumni who volunteer their time as interviewers throughout the world, and we hope many of you will join their ranks wherever you go.  As the numbers of applicants continue to grow, the need for enthusiastic interviewers is greater than ever.
These are merely a few of the ways that you can contribute to the admissions process.  We are enormously grateful to all the students and alumni who already participate.  Join us in shaping the future Harvard!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 5, pro-Gaddafi forces abducted three journalists and a photographer. One of those journalists was Clare M. Gillis, a former Teaching Fellow at the College and an investigative reporter for The Atlantic.
As of last night, reports continue to circulate that Gillis, captured near the hotly contested town of Brega, may now be in Tripoli and may soon be released. For the sake of her safety and those others arrested with her, we can only hope that she and her companions are released as soon as possible and that they are spared the same harsh treatment as other prisoners of the Gaddafi regime.
Over the last two months, the Gaddafi regime has similarly arrested a number of journalists from such media outlets such as the New York Times, Al-Jazeera, and Agence France-Presse (all of whom were unlawfully detained before being subsequently released). Two BBC journalists have even alleged that they were tortured and subjected to a mock execution by Gaddafi’s soldiers. In short, the inability of Gaddafi’s forces to respect the human rights of the international press corps is as repulsive as it is an indication that his regime has lost any credibility whatsoever. After all, journalists have a duty to chronicle events with impartiality and honor to inform and educate the public, and regimes that inhibit this duty are already corrupt beyond salvation.
Aside from her duty as a journalist, however, we should also take stock of the particularly valuable type of work Gillis was doing before her capture. Over the past five years, the field of journalism has been altered significantly with the rise of remote blogging, in which a writer need not actually be present to report. In fact, it is striking how much media information on the Middle East’s revolutions emerges from field work from contributors armed only with a fast wireless connection. In that sense, at a time when it is all too easy to encounter so much suspect information and ill-informed opinion on the Internet, the importance of journalists like Gillis undertaking serious investigative projects cannot be stressed enough. As a true investigative reporter, nominally freelance but reporting in this case for The Atlantic, Gillis sought to uncover some of the facts behind an opaque and complicated world crisis. And without the work of people like her, we would know even less than we do already do about what is really happening in places like Libya. In other words, reporters like Clare Gillis are the reason our society can still actively learn about itself and the larger context in which it exists.
To that end—and in light of Gillis’s recent arrest—Harvard would do well to emphasize the role of journalism as a mode of public service. The University’s various organizations and schools—from the undergraduate International Relations’ Council to the John F. Kennedy School of Government—play an important role as advocates for the merits of public service. Harvard is also a major originator of public service undertaken by qualified and ambitious young people. Yet where in this environment is journalism recognized as a similarly valuable means of social contribution? To be sure, Gillis’s career choice seems unusual for Harvard’s graduate body, and, consequently, the inherent public service of journalism, and especially conflict journalism, should feature much more prominently in campus discourse.
At this point in the Libyan conflict, of course, Harvard University would only be able to play a minimal role in securing Gillis’s release. However, when and if Gaddafi’s forces do release Gillis, Harvard would do well to invite her back to Cambridge to speak and to share her experiences with the entire community. Gillis stands to educate others about an unusual set of first-hand experiences, and we should recognize her intrepid professional work and her unjust treatment.
As mentioned already, Gillis’s case is far from isolated in Libya. The illegal detainment and reports of violence against international reporters exist as one of many atrocities perpetrated by Gaddafi’s forces. As though the international community needed further evidence of the embattled regime’s moral standing—after the now routine and indiscriminate attacks on Libyan civilians—the suppression of independent media only helps to invalidate the authority of the government. Gaddafi should order an immediate halt to any effort to stifle journalists but, moreover, must also cease all illegal activities directed against his own civilians.  To those who doubt whether international observers should take a stand in what has become a civil war in Libya, it says something powerful about the two opposing sides that one has basically respected the rights of the media while the other has repeatedly violated them. While we should hope for the immediate release of Clare Gillis, an individual whose plight resonates on this campus and with this country, we should not forget that such distressing events will continue to happen as Muammar Gaddafi remains in place to direct them. For the sake of the journalists and the civilians, it is high time for justice finally to be served.

During post-Yardfest festivities, Far East Movement (FEM) tries to hook up with Sam Adams (SA) and The White Panda (WP) at a Mather House dorm party. Although FEM lays down some seductive lyrics, SA spits only rejection in response. Confused by the crossfire but eager for some action, WP only manages to  mash up what is said by the others:
FEM: O-M-G, you’re so sexy. I bet you hop under the covers and play    with yourself, ’cause I would, if I was you.
SA: I’m the fuckin’ man.
FEM: You wanna bang bang boogie with a freak?
WP: I’m the fuckin’ freak!
SA: Homie, get the fuck away from me.
FEM: Take a second, hear me out. I see you, you see me, I see her too let’s be three.
WP: Homie, let’s be three.
SA: Really girl, I’m just trying to party.
FEM: Did you hear what I said boo? I want you, and your friend too. You and me and her can have a fun menag-a-three.
WP: Really, have a fun menag-a-three!
SA: If you ain’t a 10 get your hands off my bottle.
FEM: Can I ask for that math? I mean your number. I mean some ass.
SA: The way you look is a problem.
FEM: It is what it is.
SA: I’m not being mean, just being me.
FEM: Ya better gimme what I need.
SA (to himself): Late night I’m fucked up, trying to find the exit. I keep on shaking my head but this chick wants it between the legs, shit.
WP: Ya better gimme it between the legs, shit.
FEM: Can’t leave without saying goodbye to your angel face. From your head to your shoulders you can’t shake me off.
SA: Baby I don’t give a fuck.
(Sam Adams leaves)
WP: Can’t leave without a fuck!
FEM: There’s something about you. There’s something about us, that makes me just want to ...
WP: Makes me just want to ...
FEM: Hell yeahh!! I’m not looking for no strings. If you’re ready for this fling, then meet me in the back.
WP: Hell yeahh!! In the back.
(Far East Movement and The White Panda head to the back for a fun menag-a-two.)

A Close Reading of that Scene in Mean Girls Featuring the 2011 Class Day Speaker Amy Poehler
Assignment for: History and Literature Junior Tutorial
Poehler enters Regina’s bedroom wearing a pink Juicy sweat suit, the designer brand indicated by the letter “J” on the zipper, symbolizing the F. Scott Fitzgeraldian obsession with youth through material objects. The brand “Juicy” is itself a problematized concept—as an adjective it degrades the female who wears it, suggesting that American women seek to display their body parts for male pleasure and fetishization. Poehler (who is only ever referred to as “Regina’s mom,” indicating the glorification of her role as mother) asks the girls about the “411,” the “hot gossip,” the “cool jams.” These anachronisms that represent her failed attempt to relate to her daughter evoke the politics of intergenerational representations of the divide between Baby Boomers and their teenage offspring. The parental “figure” pressures the teenaged subordinate to socialize, which in fact engenders the heteronormative “hook-up” culture that facilitates the development of the so-called “teen identity.”
Poehler, or “nameless mother,” stretches out her arms (representing the physical struggle that women encounter in the domestic sphere at the expense of any real exertion outside of the home) and engulfs Cady in a hug, trapping Cady between her two silicone breasts. “The boob job”: a gendered manifestation of hegemonic masculinity and of the carnal desires of society’s mysoginistic men. The supposed superior gender mythologizes the subordination of women and bestows painful physical re-creation that translates to an identity transformation of society’s female population.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About two months after the eruption of antigovernment revolts in Benghazi, Libya, a panel of experts sat down yesterday afternoon to evaluate the United States’ intervention in Libya at “After Libya–A Revival of the Age of Intervention?”
The panel, held at the Harvard Center for Government and International Studies, was sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and the European Club at Harvard Kennedy School.
“We want to conceptualize and put the intervention in Libya into a greater context,” said Bjoern H. Seibert, moderator of the event.
Panelists included Middle East History Professor E. Roger Owen, Colonel and Weatherhead Center Fellow Dagvin R. M. Anderson, and MIT Political Science Professor Barry R. Posen. Owen started the panel discussion by giving a historical perspective on Libya and its government.
“I spent my honeymoon in Libya back in the 1960s,” Owen said.
Owen explained that there is a disconnect between Muammar Gaddafi’s conception of the people and the reality in Libya.
“I think the people around Gaddafi created this bubble where he [Gaddafi] sees what they want him to see,” Owen said. “The world he rules over is actually not the world he thought.”
Posen expressed his disapproval of the U.S. intervention in Libya, arguing that the U.S. is already stretched too thin in its military obligations.
“The U.S. is already involved in too many wars,” Posen said. “It does not need to get involved in any more, not even as a partial participant.”
Posen added that in this situation, it would have been more beneficial to make a region of Libya a “safe zone” rather than relying on military intervention.
“It is time for the U.S. to lower its profile in the Arab world, not escalate it,” Posen said. “They [Arabs] want to own change and own their own future.”
Government Professor Stanley Hoffmann, who was slated to be on the panel, was not able to attend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum held a panel on tobacco control and mitigating global tobacco use yesterday.
The United States has seen a dramatic decline in tobacco use since its peak in the 1950s, though most developing countries are now seeing a surge in smoking rates, according to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt.
One of the greatest difficulties in preventing tobacco use is the difference in tobacco regulation across countries.
“There is a great future in the tobacco market and it is in the developing world,” Brandt said. “Global health is about the relations of problems across nations.”
Most tobacco control issues now focus on the developing world and spreading awareness of the health risks associated with smoking through government policy.
“You need to make sure there is no local corruption, a free press, and a strong judicial system,” Harvard School of Public Health Professor Gregory N. Connolly said. He is fond of the acronym “KILLS: Keep It Loud and Local Stupid” as a basic approach to working with tobacco control in developing countries.
The World Health Organization has established uniform standards for production, taxation, distribution, and advertising of tobacco products. Currently, 172 countries have ratified the standards laid out in the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The United States has signed but not ratified the treaty.
Connolly said this is because the United States values the free market over global health. Connolly said that in Thailand, the government was forced to permit the importation of U.S. cigarettes, even though it was shown that this would probably increase smoking rates and result in worse health outcomes.
In the first world, the health concerns associated with smoking have led some groups to propose a divestiture from tobacco companies. Harvard divested its tobacco securities in the early 1990s, according to Connolly.
Connolly advocated for other academic institutions to follow Harvard’s example.
“You should write an admissions guide warning people that Yale takes tobacco money,” Connolly joked, referencing the professorship in wildlife ecology and policy sciences endowed by former Phillip Morris CEO, and Yale alum, Joseph F. Cullman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a petition circulated throughout House and extracurricular e-mail lists, Abhishek J. Bose-Kolanu ’11 is soliciting greater College support for student artists.
The petition, released on April 2, includes four requests: the development of a fully-funded yearlong post-graduate fellowship exclusively for artists, the creation of a yearlong artist-in-residence program for graduates more than a year out of college, the installment of an officer at the Office of Career Services dedicated to finding opportunities for student artists, and an institutional commitment to one art show per year in the main gallery of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts.
“As I was applying for grants to pursue art making after graduation, I realized there were no funds dedicated specifically for this purpose,” Bose-Kolanu wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson. “It struck me that there is a large disparity in resources committed to helping the average student get a finance or consulting job versus the resources committed to further the careers of students who choose to make art.”
The original email containing a link to the petition states that students will ask for their classmates’ support in arts and arts-related classes throughout this week.
Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts, is among several prospective recipients of the petition. While he has not yet received it personally, he acknowledges the relevance of its objectives.
“The spirit of this petition is great,” Megan said. “I think that this is a really interesting and worthwhile idea that ultimately comes down to resource allocation. Students are asking for enhanced resources and we would welcome exploring that.”
Megan acknowledged that the majority of artist fellowships are provided to current undergraduates, but also noted that there are a very limited number available to graduating artists.
Professor of English and of Visual and Environmental Studies Marjorie Garber, who also has not received the petition, said that financial constraints may hinder the implementation of these requests.
“Even if the art displayed in the Carpenter Center were free or the art were local, it is expensive to install it and insure it,” she said.
OCS Director Robin Mount received the petition as a forwarded email from a colleague.
In response to the request for the installment of an OCS officer dedicated to student artists, she said that there were already two advisers who have expertise within the arts and that OCS hosted a series of programs about careers in the arts in the fall.
“What many people don’t realize is that these jobs in the arts and art management can be frustrating them because they are the sorts of jobs where people have to leave in order for there to be an opening,” she said. “These are organizations that don’t have huge extra budgets and many rely on donor contributions.”
Mount also said that the allocation and creation of post-graduate fellowships, which are donor-driven, are not at her office’s discretion.
“The OCS does not decide where these fellowships go,” she said. “Post-graduate fellowships are unique and many schools don’t even have them.”
Bose-Kolanu will continue to engage the support of faculty and administrators for these measures, in addition to soliciting student signatures on campus, he said.
“We have a concentration for artists, so we must think their contributions to society are meaningful,” he wrote. “If that’s the case, we should whole-heartedly support them.”

Harvard University will create a new fellowship for students in Chile to pursue graduate degrees at Harvard.
The agreement with the Chilean government will provide funding to Chilean students for masters and Ph.D. programs at Harvard, according to Jorge I. Dominguez, vice provost for international affairs.
The agreement comes on the heels of University President Drew G. Faust’s visit to Chile last month, building on the University’s 10 year relationship with the country.
The fellowship will likely cover expenses for about 15 Ph.D. students at a time, in addition to an undecided number of master’s degree candidates. There are currently 10 Chilean Ph.D. students at Harvard.
The University will shoulder the funding responsibility with the Chilean government, resulting in a roughly even division of costs among the two, Dominguez said.
He said he hopes to sign the agreement formally in September, when Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, who received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1976, plans to visit Harvard.
Faust and Piñera agreed during her visit to move forward with the agreement between Chile’s minister of education and Dominguez, which they hope will foster an increase in the number of Chilean students enrolling at Harvard.
Dominguez said that he feels that fellowships of this kind are important because international students are often in need of financial aid and fewer resources exist in their home country to fund advanced degrees abroad.
Giselle M. Huerta García ’12, who grew up in Chile, said she would like to see more partnerships between Harvard and universities in Chile.
“Given the influence that Chile and Brazil have had in the economic and political arena in the past decade, I think it is very important that Harvard is taking an interest in this region,” García said.
This year there are 37 Chilean students at Harvard across the University, according to Dominguez.
Harvard has had academic partnerships with Chile for many years.
The Harvard-based David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies was founded in 1994. In 2002, it established a regional office in Santiago, Chile that has served as an outpost for undergraduate studies and internships in Latin America.
For about 10 years, Harvard has been a partner in the Magellan Telescopes project, along with the Universidad de Chile, the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and several other American institutions.
For the past five years, faculty members from Harvard Graduate School of Education and Harvard Medical School have partnered with Fundación Educacional Oportunidad, Chile’s Ministry of Education, and the Universidad Diego Portales to work on a project researching early childhood education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council announced that Harvard will officially recognize university-wide student groups in a press release yesterday.
The pilot program, which has been in the works for two years, will give 10 student organizations the opportunity to claim university-wide status in the next academic year.
Even though this idea has been discussed for some time, it was difficult for the various groups to collaborate to bring it to fruition because of University decentralization, according to Aaron D. Chadbourne ’06, former president of the Harvard Graduate Council and current student at Harvard Law and Business Schools.
Chadbourne said he believes the two-year effort will pay off.
“Being part of a university should mean that we should be able to connect to all parts of the University,” Chadbourne said. “When we were looking for ways for people to connect to each other, we found that the best way is through shared interests and shared passions. The mechanism was to put the people together with shared interests and different skill sets, so that amazing things can happen.”
Current President of the Harvard Graduate Council Pukar Malla echoed these sentiments.
“The program will also help create a more engaged student community, enabling us to live up to the ideals of One Harvard,” said Malla, who is a student at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Many student organizations across the University have been trying to gain university-wide status for some time, in the hopes of having a greater impact on campus.
Mariam Chughtai, a fourth year doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education and president of the Harvard Pakistan Student Group, said she is thrilled that after a long process, the University is willing to grant legitimacy to university-wide groups.
“Students that care about the same issues are dispersed across schools in small pockets within the schools,” Chughtai said. “Without a centralized system, they will never come in contact with other Harvard students who care about the same issues. Harvard needs to facilitate these students so they can network and collaborate.”
Chughtai added that Harvard’s recognition of university-wide groups will allow student organizations with similar missions to support each other instead of fighting over resources.
“Members of Harvard Pakistan Student Group have school-based organizations as well,” she said. “The organizations are not in competition with the university-wide group. Instead they strengthen each other.”
Though many say that the presence of university-wide groups will benefit all of Harvard, the program still faces a number of concerns.
There are no shared resources and infrastructure, which may pose problems for these new groups. Additionally, each of the groups will have to find funding.
Some of the stipulations of being a university-wide organization include having members from at least three different schools, with a minimum of 20 members overall. The group must be led by a president, secretary, and treasurer and only have enrolled degree-seeking students as officers.
The Harvard Graduate Council is accepting applications from student organizations seeking university-wide status until 5 p.m. on May 2. Candidates will be informed of the decisions by May 16.

After a week of talking to students in Harkness Commons and passing out fliers boasting their candidacy, Skyler F. Cho ’05, a second year at Harvard Law School, and Rachna Shah, a first year, have been elected as the new President and Vice President of Harvard Law School Student Government.
Since starting at the Law School, both Cho and Shah have been active in student government. As the 1L representative from her section, Shah was promoted last winter to the Director of Faculty Engagement. Cho, who was also a 1L representative his first year, has since served as the Director of Internal Affairs.
Former Student Government President Jennifer D. Dein, along with the majority of the student government, endorsed the Cho-Shah ticket. Dein said that when Cho was Director of Internal Affairs, he worked hard on everything.
“He was very much behind the scenes, and wasn’t looking for recognition for anything,” Dein said. “He ran [for president] not because he wanted it on his resume, but because he wanted to help the student government.”
Jungmee Lee, a first year who is in Shah’s section, said that Shah always stepped up to do her job—for example, asking professors to institute a break during a two-hour lecture.
“I’m very excited that they won,” Lee said. “I voted for them.”
Student government, which only became a substantial student organization four years ago, has nevertheless begun to evolve as a respected body of authority on campus, according to Dein.
Corinne V. Snow, a second year, said that although the student government still does not impact her life, their presence—especially in the last year—has become more noticeable on campus.
In addition to continued growth and outreach to students, Cho and Shah said their most pressing goals are to facilitate interaction between student leaders across the Law School in order to foster collaboration and communication.
They said they also hope to target student leaders to join the student government’s board of directors—positions that are appointed, not elected. A diverse group of student leaders on the board, they said, will help ensure that problems across campus are identified and fixed.

CORRECTION: APRIL 13, 2011
The April 13 article "Harvard Law School Elects New Student Government Officers" misstated the class year of Skyler F. Cho ’05. Cho is a second year—not third year—student at the Law School.

Despite recent concerns that China is attempting to expand its military influence in East Asia, the United States will continue to be the “pivotal military power” in the region, said Ashton B. Carter, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, in his speech at the Institute of Politics yesterday.
“We are certainly not going anywhere,” Carter said. “They rolled out a stealth fighter and we’re going to have 2,443 stealth fighters. The idea that the pivotal role of the United States will erode or will be eroded isn’t so. It just isn’t going to happen.”
Carter said that the United States is not threatened by the recent growth of the Chinese armed forces.
“China’s military is increasing in size and sophistication and that’s absolutely fine, but everywhere we see anything that would erode our power or ability to play the pivotal role in the Pacific, we react,” Carter said.
He said that he did not believe a military confrontation between the two superpowers is inevitable or desirable. He added that the best way to avoid conflict is to have transparency and open channels of communication.
Despite competition with China and ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, Carter said that the Department of Defense is focused on cutting its budget just as every other government agency must.
He said that while national defense discretionary spending is not the primary driver of the deficit, he acknowledged that defense spending contributes to the deficit, at 20.3 percent of annual spending.
Carter said that the Department of Defense is currently examining its spending to assure that taxpayers’ money is being spent in the most efficient manner.
“With a budget war raging now in Washington, for us that means that we have an extra burden to prove to the taxpayer that we are spending the money in a way that is respectful to the taxpayer at a time of economic and fiscal distress,” Carter said. He added that the Department of Defense is focused on stretching its dollars in the must efficient way possible by focusing on “productivity growth.”
“We must deliver more without more—more capabilities without more dollars ... We must live within our means and still defend the country,” Carter said.
At the same time, Carter stressed the importance of investing in technologies like MRAP All Terrain Vehicles—which shield soldiers in Afghanistan from explosives—to protect American soldiers.
“My motto was, ‘It is better an MRAP without a soldier than a soldier without an MRAP,’” Carter said.
Given the recent debates about the national budget and last week’s fears about the federal government being shut down, Jordan E. Sessler ’13, the Student Chair of the IOP Forum Committee, said it was important for students to hear about what the federal government is doing to solve its fiscal problems.
“This is a time there is a lot going on in the economy and people deserve to know how these problems interact with what is going on in Washington,” Sessler said.

Between the two train tracks at the Kendall Square subway stop, a line of silver tubes dangles from the ceiling like a row of silent wind chimes.
One week from now, these tubes, actually bells, will once again fill the Red Line train station with music.
The restoration of the bells is the work of the Kendall Band Preservation Society, a group of MIT students who have spent the past eight months refurbishing the Kendall Band.
The Kendall Band is a structure built by Paul H. Matisse ’54 in the 1980s at the request of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and the installation allows passengers waiting for the subway to play metal instruments by pulling handles on either platform.
Originally implemented as a part of “Arts on the Line”—an initiative to improve the appearance of the Red Line—the three instruments at the Kendall Square station have since broken down.
The Kendall Band’s deteriorating condition has raised concern, according to Clarise Snyder, director of the MIT Concerts Office and one of the coordinators of the restoration project.
“[It] had fallen into such disrepair that it had become a source of frustration for the public, the MBTA, and the artist,” Snyder wrote in an email. “How much fun can anyone experience while waiting for the T other than listening to your iPod?”
The Preservation Society, a core group of about 10 MIT students, has focused its repairs on Pythagoras, the instrument composed of cylindrical bells that hang vertically between the tracks. Pythagoras is expected to be fully functional again next week, according to Michael J. Tarkanian, an MIT instructor in materials science and engineering and the director of the restoration.
On April 30, the Preservation Society, Matisse, and MBTA General Manager Richard A. Davey will host an opening celebration and improvisational musical performance at the Kendall Square T-stop.
“We always heard now and then, ‘It would be great if someone would fix it,’” said Shaymus W. Hudson, a member of the Preservation Society and a junior at MIT.
The Preservation Society took down the bells to start the repairs last July and recently reassembled them at the station. The handles that control the instrument, however, have not yet been returned.
After the group took down the handles, they put up posters to make clear that the installation was under repair. Hudson said that people have written messages on the posters thanking the group for their work.
“I just hope that people enjoy the sculpture and are glad that it’s back and get a sense of the amount of time and effort that we, and the students, put in to get this thing up and running again,” Tarkanian said.
The group plans to start repairing the remaining two instruments, called Galileo and Kepler, this summer.

Cast members and creators of HBO’s “The Wire” called for students to tackle the causes and consequences of poverty that are vividly portrayed in the television show at a panel at Harvard Law School last night.
Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree organized the event, the second such gathering of cast members at Harvard this academic year, in conjunction with a course he is teaching this spring at the Law School called “Race and Justice: The Wire.”
The event was in part a celebration of the show—the cast reminisced about their favorite scenes and plot twists—but also a discussion about America’s inner-city poor.
Co-creator of the show Ed Burns—who participated in the panel via Skype—spoke about the show’s link to real social issues.
“It’s about race, it’s about class, it’s about institutions and how those institutions perceive people, how people are chewed up by institution,” Burns said. “We looked at a world we knew fairly well, [and were able to] explore the truths hidden behind mist.”
The panel included Jamie Hector (Marlo Stanfield), Jim True-Frost (Roland ‘Prez’ Pryzbylewski), Andre Royo (Bubbles), Sonja Sohn (Kima Greggs), and Michael K. Williams (Omar Little). Fran Boyd and Donnie Andrews, who served as real-life inspirations for characters on the show, were also on the panel. In addition to Burns, show co-creator and writer David Simon spoke to the crowd via Skype.
Williams said that although he sometimes questioned whether portraying a violent drug dealer glorified a criminal lifestyle and black-on-black violence, he said he believed “The Wire” had a good influence on Baltimore and the nation as a whole.
“[‘The Wire’] showed mainstream America what’s really going on,” Williams said, explaining that the show had given the poor a voice in mainstream America. “Although ‘The Wire’ is set in Baltimore, there’s a wire in every city.”
Many of the cast and crew took the opportunity to talk policy. When asked to discuss what Harvard Law students can do to help save American cities from poverty, both Simon and Sohn issued a call to action to the audience.
“We’re going to need to pick up a brick and get out in the street,” Simon said. He said that ever since the 1970s, inner-city poor and working class families have been neglected.
“Nothing is going to change the plutocracy until there are people in the street to change the plutocracy. We have found a way of throwing away people,” he said. “We have to have the courage to going back to who we were.”
Wesley D. Lewis, a first year at the Law School and a student in Ogletree’s seminar on “The Wire” this semester, said that he enrolled in the class because of Ogletree’s prestige. But once he caught up on episodes of the show, he said he soon realized why the show created such a phenomenon.
“A lot of people are attracted to the show—it’s more than just entertainment,” Lewis said. “A lot of people connect to the show because it sheds light onto real issues.”
Donna Ackermann, who is not affiliated with the University, said she came to the event because of her love for the show. She said she supported the multiple calls for Law School students to become public servants.
“If you don’t do that at Harvard Law School, where else are you going to do it?”

Blayn Jiggetts—the defendant in the Kirkland shooting case who allegedly brought and loaded the gun that killed Justin Cosby—began his testimony yesterday in the trial of alleged shooter Jabrai Jordan Copney.
Jiggetts recounted in detail the events surrounding the May 18, 2009 shooting of Cambridge resident Cosby, as Jiggetts answered questions from Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 in rapid succession.
According to Jiggetts, Copney had intended to rob Cosby of his marijuana and asked Jiggetts to bring a gun along because Cosby “was a street kid.”
Jiggetts, who assisted Copney in the alleged armed robbery of two Yale students in New York in late 2008, turned to his longtime friend Jason Aquino for the weapon. Aquino gave Jiggetts a 9-millimeter semiautomatic in exchange for Aquino’s share of the robbery, according to Jiggetts.
The original plan was to make the exchange on May 17, but Jiggetts said he was “having second thoughts about the robbery and didn’t want to go through with it,” Jiggetts noted in court yesterday.
In his testimony, Jiggetts said that he and Aquino met Copney at the McDonald’s in South Station to plan the robbery. Jiggetts would pull the firearm out and demand the marijuana, and Copney would take the drugs.
The trio met Copney’s girlfriend and former Harvard College student Brittany J. Smith in her dorm room in Lowell House where Copney asked Jiggetts to load the gun, Jiggetts said yesterday.
The three men left Lowell for Kirkland House and searched the entryways of the Annex for a secluded, quiet area using Smith’s Harvard University ID card. They settled on the art room in the basement of J-entryway before making arrangements with Cosby to meet there, Jiggetts said.
Copney and Aquino, who thought they could better impersonate Harvard students, met Cosby in his car. The four were reunited in the basement of J-entryway about 10 minutes later, according to Jiggetts.
As planned, Jiggetts pulled the firearm out of his bookbag and raised it to Cosby, demanding the marijuana that they had agreed to purchase. Cosby waved the marijuana in front of Jiggetts but did not let Jiggetts pull it away from him. This exchange carried on a few times before Copney tapped Jiggetts on the shoulder, and Jiggetts handed the firearm to him.
Jiggetts told Copney to let Cosby go, he said yesterday in court.
“In my eyes, it wasn’t worth it,” Jiggetts said. “We were trying to take a small amount of marijuana, and it was turning into something different.”
As Cosby pushed past Jiggetts, Jiggetts heard a gunshot, then two more. He rejoined Copney and watched Cosby run through the gate of the Annex. The three men left Kirkland House for Smith’s room, where they waited for Smith to call a cab.
The four then took the cab to South Station and left for New York where Aquino’s girlfriend was waiting for them, according to Jiggetts.
Jiggetts said that he and Copney discussed what happened.
“What did you state to him?” Bennett asked.
“I said ‘Thank God you didn’t hit him,’” Jiggetts said.
“What did Copney say back to you?”
“‘I’m telling you I did,’” Jiggetts recalled Copney saying. “‘I don’t miss.’”
Jiggetts was originally charged with first degree murder but pled guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter. He was promised a shorter sentence if he complied with the investigation and testified in Copney’s trial.
After Jiggetts was sworn in yesterday, a minor outburst in the court audience broke out between Jiggetts’ significant other and Copney’s mother. The jury was briefly removed from the court while Associate Justice John T. Lu settled the dispute.
Jiggetts will continue his testimony today.

From Brussels to Cambridge—two entrepreneurs plan to bring made-to-order Belgian waffles to Harvard Square by July 1 with the opening of Zinneken’s at 1154 Mass. Ave.
Co-founders—Bertrand Lempkowicz and Nhon T. Ma—obtained a Common Victualer License after a hearing in front of the Cambridge License Commission on Tuesday. With this permit and another food service license that the men have yet to obtain, they will be able to open a restaurant that does not serve alcohol.
The bakery will serve sweet waffles, which Ma described as “fluffy” and different from American varieties. The waffles are textured with melted pearl sugar drops—one of the many ingredients Ma will import from Belgium because they are not widely available in the United States.
The waffles will feature a variety of toppings, including fruit, whipped cream, Belgian chocolate, Nutella, and imported syrup, Ma said.
In addition, the bakery will sell another, crunchier type of waffle and Belgian chocolate.
According to Ma, in Belgium, people usually eat the waffles as a take-away snack. Zinneken’s will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 12 a.m. daily.
Zinneken’s will open in the former location of Arrow Street Crepes, above Berryline at the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Arrow Street.
The restaurant will have limited seating, with around 19 seats. Ma said he believes the small space will help create a “cozy European environment.”
“We’re trying to bring a real Belgian experience. We’ll serve the waffles as they are served on the streets in Brussels,” Ma said.
Zinneken’s has joined the Harvard Square Business Association, and the founders have been searching for a location since last summer, according to business association executive director Denise A. Jillson.
“They’re doing a good job creating a very charming Belgian waffle eatery. It will serve very authentic Belgian waffles,” Jillson said.
Ma said he is excited to introduce a new restaurant to the Boston area.
Originally from Belgium, Lempkowicz and Ma have been traveling back and forth from Brussels to Boston since 2004, and recently began to do market research for the restaurant.
Ma said he sees Harvard Square as a vibrant community for whom his product will be appealing.
“We’re taking a risk in bringing a new product on the market, but I think it will appeal to the students and the tourists in Harvard Square. There’s nothing like it,” Ma said.

With a potentially lucrative coaching offer beckoning in South Florida, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker leveraged interest shown by the University of Miami to secure guarantees of resources for him and his coaching staff, including a pay increase for his assistant coaches and future work on Lavietes Pavilion, according to a booster involved in men’s basketball.
Amaker met with officials from the University of Miami on Monday, sparking fears that the coach credited with bringing the school a share of its first-ever men’s basketball Ivy championship would leave Cambridge. But the next day, Amaker announced that he would remain at the helm of the Crimson.
“I am appreciative of and flattered by the interest shown in me by other fine universities, but I am proud and honored to represent Harvard,” Amaker said in a press release.
His continued presence at Harvard will come with additional perks to the program here, according to the booster, a member of the alumni organization Friends of Harvard Basketball.
“I’d say that, as a result of this, the Friends are stepping up their efforts even more than what we did prior to this—absolutely,” the booster said, who was granted anonymity to maintain his relationship with Harvard.
While there were a number of factors affecting Amaker’s decision—including his wife’s position as a faculty member at the Harvard Medical School—the additional promises likely made it easier to turn down overtures from the Hurricanes, which reportedly featured a five-year offer worth $1.1 million per year. That contract would have vastly surpassed Amaker’s yearly salary at Harvard, the booster said.
“I think Tommy was looking for a reason to stay, and it just helped justify it in his mind that this was the right place for him,” the booster said.
Last year, when signing a multi-year extension on his contract with Harvard, Amaker had presented the school with a set of changes to be delivered over time, including work on the Lavietes Pavilion locker rooms, which was completed last summer.
And with overtures from Miami, Amaker and his agent David B. Falk—best known for representing notable NBA clientele such as Michael Jordan—seized the chance to strengthen the coach’s negotiating position with the University.
“I do think part of this, meeting with [University of Miami] no doubt was a little posturing on his side to make sure this wish list of his was sort of accelerated,” the booster said.
On the list of his requests was a country club membership, first reported by Sports Illustrated writer Pablo S. Torre ’07, a former Crimson sports editor. It remains unclear whether the boosters will act to fulfill that request.
But among the program’s supporters, Amaker’s wish list did not raise eyebrows.
“Everything he’s asked for is very, very reasonable, the booster said. “If it was unreasonable, I don’t think the Friends would step up and do it.”
A former head coach at Seton Hall and Michigan, Amaker’s name had been linked to an opening at Georgia Tech earlier this year, but the move to South Beach was the first potential offer that he was reported to be seriously considering. Amaker’s interest was surprising to some given the lack of cachet associated with the position at Miami as well as Amaker’s success at Harvard.
In four seasons with the Crimson, Amaker has led the program to a share of its first-ever Ivy championship and the two best seasons in school history. Harvard looks to be the heavy favorite to capture the top spot in the Ancient Eight next season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an overcast April day at Soldiers Field, Harvard (22-12, 6-2 Ivy) took two games from visiting Holy Cross (12-17, 6-2 Patriot) in convincing fashion. Freshman third baseman Kasey Lange knocked three out of the park to propel the Ivy League-leading Crimson, and the home team coasted past Holy Cross, 8-1 and 13-4.
“It was definitely chilly out there today,” Lange said. “I’m from California, so I’m still adjusting to this New England weather. Everything worked out for me today though.”
With the two victories, Harvard has now won 10 of its last 12.
HARVARD 13, HOLY CROSS 4
The Crusaders opened game two with a pair of runs in the first and the third. But five-run bursts from the Crimson in the bottom of the fourth and the sixth innings gave the team a dominant nine-run lead. Umpires called the game at the end of the sixth on account of the mercy rule.
Harvard’s comeback was sparked by a two-run homer from Lange in the third, cutting Holy Cross’ lead down to one.
“I’ve been working hard in the cage,” Lange said. “I’m seeing the ball really well right now, so that’s always good.”
Lange struck again in the sixth, knocking in the seventh homer of the season and third of the day. She finished the game with six RBI.
Co-captain and second baseman Ellen Macadam went 2-for-2 with a pair of RBI and a steal to further catalyze the comeback-turned-mercy-rule victory. Macadam  currently leads the team with a .416 batting average on the year.
“We knew we were better than them, and we knew we could hit their pitchers,” Macadam said. “We stayed calm in the dugout, played tough defense, and kept firing at the plate.”
Two key coaching decisions facilitated Harvard’s 13-run spree. Junior pitcher Mari Zumbro relieved struggling starter and classmate Julia Moore after the Crimson fell behind by four in the top of the third. Zumbro then proceeded to pitch shut-out ball for the rest of the game for her first win of the season.
In the bottom of the fourth, sophomore catcher Olivia Piccione pinch-hit for freshman outfielder Jackie Cooley and drove in the go-ahead run on a two-RBI double to put Harvard up, 5-4. This sparked a five-run inning, and Holy Cross never caught up.
Junior shortstop Jane Alexander added two RBI of her own, both off of stand-up doubles. Harvard only left four runners on base in the game, something it had been struggling with earlier in the season.
HARVARD 8, HOLY CROSS 1
Lange demonstrated her power early, going yard on an 0-2 pitch in the bottom of the first to get the Crimson started. The team never looked back on the way to a dominant 8-1 victory in the first game of the afternoon.
Harvard scored three runs—all with two outs—in the opening frame and added three more in the bottom of the fifth to all but seal the win. Junior pitcher Rachel Brown pitched six innings of one-run ball and tallied eight strikeouts.
“We’re starting to be aggressive,” Macadam said. “[We’re] just trying to have an offensive mentality and really run people into the ground.”
Lange added two more RBI in the second and fourth innings, finishing 3-for-4 for the game. Last week, Lange was named Ivy Rookie of the Week after driving in nine runs in six games. She currently has 39 RBI on the year.
“We just attacked their pitchers,” Macadam said. “[Coach Jenny Allard] has been preaching it, and it’s showing on the field.”
Sophomore outfielder Ashley Heritage and Zumbro each added RBI of their own, and three throwing errors by Holy Cross led to three unearned runs.
The Crimson’s offensive effort gave Brown all of the support she needed. With the victory, the junior improved her record to a commanding 14-5, with 210 strikeouts and a 1.87 ERA.
“It’s great to come away with a pair of wins,” Lange said. “This coming weekend is going to be huge as far as the conference goes, and gaining some confidence with victories like these can only be a good thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping a heartbreaker at Cornell last weekend, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team rebounded yesterday, posting a strong performance at Quinnipiac.
The Crimson (7-4, 1-2 Ivy) jumped out to an early lead, but the Bobcats (4-5, 2-0 NEC) never fell far behind. It wasn’t until the second half, when Harvard outscored Quinnipiac 10-5, that it was able to pull away and win the game, 14-7.
“This game was very important for us,” said Crimson junior attackman Jeff Cohen. “We had lost three of our last four, so it was important for us to get on the right track going into the final Ivy League games.”
Cohen led all goal scorers with three goals. Captain Dean Gibbons also had a solid outing, dishing out three assists to go with one goal.
“Dean’s our leader,” Cohen said. “He’s having an unbelievable season, and he’s always able to dish off great passes.”
Despite being hit with two early penalties, Harvard was able to put enough pressure on the ball to keep the Bobcats from capitalizing on the extra-man opportunities. When the Crimson’s penalties had finally expired, Gibbons took advantage of an offside call against Quinnipiac and scored the initial goal of the game off an assist from sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens.
Bobcats senior attackman Jack Oppenheimer tied the game less than two minutes later, but Harvard countered with two goals from seniors Matt Hull and Francis Ellis, respectively, to push the score to 3-1 at the end of the first frame.
Both teams had offensive opportunities in the second quarter, but neither was able to fully take advantage, only scoring two combined goals off of 13 shots. Quinnipiac midfielder Dylan Webster scored at 10:24 to pull the Bobcats within one.
Neither team scored again until freshman forward Daniel Eipp hit the back of the net with 2:47 left to put the Crimson up 4-2 at halftime.
Quinnipiac started the second half with a goal from senior midfielder Billy Alessi just 12 seconds into the period. But Harvard’s offense quickly responded, as Cohen and Hull scored off a Gibbons assist at 11:39 and 9:15, respectively.
Sensing the Crimson’s eagerness to pull away, the Bobcats turned up their offensive pressure. A couple of shots from Quinnipiac players went wide until senior midfielder Kevin Kelly finally tallied a point for the Bobcats, making the score 6-4.
From then on, Harvard clamped down on defense and attacked the goal with greater intensity, resulting in a 6-0 run that lasted through half of the final period.
Stevens started the stretch with his only goal of the game just 20 seconds after Kelly had scored. Less than a minute later, Eipp scored again off Gibbons’ third assist of the day. Sophomore midfielder Alex White joined in the action with a goal of his own just 40 seconds later.
Within a span of 90 seconds, the Crimson offense had blown the game open, giving itself a five-goal lead heading into the last period.
But the Crimson wasn’t ready to stop there. Cohen put two more shots behind the Bobcats’ goalie in the beginning of the fourth. Harvard then scored a man-up tally on an own goal by Quinnipiac to go up 12-4.
Webster scored again for the Bobcats at 7:04. But that wasn’t enough to stop the Crimson’s momentum.
Goals by freshman attacker Carl Zimmerman and sophomore Jack Walker gave Harvard a commanding 14-5 lead with 4:31 left in the game. Quinnipiac scored twice in the closing minutes to make the final score 14-7.
“In the first half, our defense really kept us in the game,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “We struggled a little bit on offense. In the third quarter, we started to move the ball better and generated high-quality shots. I was very happy with how we scored 10 goals in the second half.”
The comfortable lead in the second half allowed every player on the Crimson’s roster to get in the game.
“The thing that I am most happy about is every single player on our roster played today,” Wojcik said. “Everyone has an important role on the team and we’re all one family. That’s what I’m most happy about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Northeastern runner easily jogged home after a sacrifice fly in the ninth inning, putting the Huskies ahead for good in a heartbreaking 6-5 loss for the Harvard baseball team.
Northeastern (9-20, 4-8 CAA) came from behind to beat the Crimson (4-25, 1-7 Ivy) yesterday afternoon at O’Donnell Field.
The cross-town rivalry matchup between Harvard and the Huskies was a back-and-forth battle that was highlighted with both small and long balls from each team.
After a weekend full of hits, the Crimson continued to hit the ball well, ending the game with nine. But it wasn’t able to capitalize on enough of Northeastern’s mistakes to take the win.
The Huskies jumped ahead from the start, as sophomore pitcher Danny Moskovits surrendured the first run of the game on an RBI-groundout to second.
But Harvard wouldn’t wait long to answer. After getting hit by a pitch in the second inning, senior catcher Tyler Albright came around to score following an RBI double from freshman third baseman Jake McGuiggan.
After a sacrifice advanced McGuiggan from second to third, freshman outfielder Jeff Hajdin laid down a perfect squeeze bunt that allowed the runner to score and gave the Crimson the lead, 2-1.
In the next inning, the Crimson was able to build the lead after a sacrifice fly from Albright. After yet another run off a single to center field from McGuiggan, Harvard moved to a 4-1 lead.
Both teams played small ball throughout the game, using sacrifice bunts, sacrifice flies, steals, and other strategic maneuvers to give them the edge.
“In such a close game, you have to get every run you can get,” McGuiggan said. “Especially today, they were making errors, so we were trying to put pressure on their defense by putting the ball on the ground.”
The Huskies would answer the Harvard’s offensive attack in the fourth with a leadoff home run and two more runs to follow to tie the game.
The Crimson and Northeastern were forced to go to their bullpens, and each used three different pitchers throughout the game, forcing one another to adjust to their rotations.
Harvard replaced Moskovits in the fourth with junior left-hander Brent Suter, who ended up dominating his batting opponents for 3.1 innings.
“I struggled on Sunday, so I just wanted to get back on the bump,” Suter said. “I wanted to pound the strike-zone and get back to my old self.”
Suter did just that, controlling the pace of the game with five strikeouts, and limiting the Huskies to no runs in his stint on the mound.
Smart base running by Hajdin broke the tie with the help of Northeastern’s error-riddled seventh inning performance.
Despite striking out, Hajdin reached first base after a throwing error by the catcher, who fumbled with the ball in the dirt. In Hajdin’s attempt to steal second, the catcher threw the ball away again, allowing the freshman to reach third.
The pitcher, continuing the string of errors, threw the ball away in a failed attempt at a pickoff, allowing Hajdin to come home.
In the eighth inning, Harvard turned to junior lefty Will Keuper to close out the game.
But the Crimson wouldn’t hold the lead for long, and Alan Pastyrnak drove in the game-tying run on a single to left-center.
Throughout the game, including the crucial bottom of the eighth, Harvard left a few men on who could have proven to be the difference in the ball game.
“We’re getting hits in spots with one or two here or there,” McGuiggan said. “We need to have more complete innings with hits [and] walks, and continue to move runners to plate more runs.”
Although Northeastern would take the lead and ultimately the game with a sacrifice fly in the ninth, its numerous errors could have cost it the victory.
“They had five errors and we had none in the field,” McGuiggan said. “So it’s always hard to swallow that type of loss.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between balancing schoolwork and practice, the members of the Harvard sailing team rarely get the opportunity to compete in an actual regatta against opposing schools during the week.
But the team got the chance to do so for the first time this season yesterday afternoon at the Midweek Technical Invitational 1, hosted by MIT on the waters of the Charles River.
“This is a different sort of atmosphere than a typical regatta,” sophomore Nick Waldo said. “There are fewer races than normal, since we compress the event into one afternoon.”
While the majority of the sailing team was off practicing elsewhere, the Crimson sent three sailors to race at the regatta to compete against several other Boston-area teams. Waldo skippered one boat alongside junior crew Caroline Lowe, both of whom also sailed at last year’s spring Midweek Technical Invitational 1. Junior Grant Wonders was paired up with a member of Wellesley College to form a mixed team in another boat.
“It’s a different experience from practice,” Waldo said. “During practice, we learn different techniques to help us perform better while racing, and we also get on-the-spot criticism and instruction from the coaches. But there’s nothing like getting to execute during an actual regatta and putting those skills to the test.”
In the low-key event, most of the focus for Harvard was placed upon executing to perfection.
“This regatta had a much more relaxing atmosphere than normal,” Waldo said. “There was less pressure, so the main point for us was to gain experience and improve our overall sailing performance.”
Harvard had to deal with the difficult job of sailing in heavy boats with light winds, but both boats handled the task at hand, sailing particularly well on the afternoon and consistently finishing near the top of the pack, coming in second to fourth place in the majority of their races. Official results for the invitational have not yet been posted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the French Open didn’t kick off until Sunday, the Harvard club tennis team faced some big-time competition of its own earlier last weekend.
The Crimson placed an impressive sixth out of 64 teams at the USTA National Campus Championships on April 6-9 in Cary, N.C., while UCLA took home the national title, winning its final match against Florida, 30-19.
Harvard started off the weekend strong, coming out of the round robin stage of play as the top team in Pool G. With this impressive start, the Crimson earned recognition as one of the nation’s top 16 teams and a chance to compete for a national title in the tournament’s elite Gold Bracket.
Harvard continued its strong start in elimination play, defeating Missouri in the Round of 16, 27-15. But unfortunately for the Crimson, the team fell in the quarterfinals to UCF, 30-19. Harvard picked up another win in consolation play, taking down Duke, 29-19. UC Santa Barbara kept the Crimson out of the top five, winning what was both teams’ final match of the weekend, 26-19, but the win over the Blue Devils earned Harvard sixth place recognition.

After years of litigation in hopes of scoring a bigger slice of Facebook, Tyler S.H. Winklevoss '04 and Cameron O.H. Winklevoss '04 were told enough is enough on Monday by a 3-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Barring further legal action, the Winklevosses are now forced to accept a deal worth well over $100 million.
The deal was originally worth $65 million, $20 million in cash and $45 million in Facebook stock. Due to the company's growth and increase in valuation since they originally struck the deal, the stock is now worth more than double its original value.
The Winklevosses had claimed that the original agreement was invalid because Facebook lied about its internal valuation of the company.
"The settlement was obtained in violation of the federal securities laws," their lead attorney Jerome B. Falk, Jr. wrote in a statement.
In the decision, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski pointed to the presence of the twins' father in the deal as reason to believe that the twins were well represented during the original negotiation.
"They brought half-a-dozen lawyers to the mediation. Howard Winklevoss—father of Cameron and Tyler, former accounting professor at Wharton School of Business and an expert in valuation—also participated," Kozinsky wrote. "The Winklevosses are not the first parties bested by a competitor who then seek to gain through litigation what they were unable to achieve in the marketplace."
Immediately after the decision was released, Tyler announced via Twitter that his lawyers intend to keep going with the legal battle. If their petition for a rehearing is denied, the only remaining option would be to request that the U.S. Supreme Cout hear the case.
The Winklevosses and Facebook declined to comment on the case.

Looking for a party to go to this weekend? How about a study group for your upcoming midterm or a place to sell your old books?
If any or all of the above apply, then check out U4U Boston, a new site created by Connor L. Waterous '14, where you can stay connected with all facets of Harvard and Boston life.
U4U allows members to access and post information on local events, jobs, parties, and special deals. There are study groups in which students can discuss homework, lectures, and readings, and a community section where members can debate a variety of campus-related topics.
The U4U marketplace provides students with an easy way to buy and sell used goods including books, clothing, furniture, electronics, and even sports supplies.
The site has been in development since August and launched officially on March 31. Since then, more than 15,000 students from the Boston area have signed up for a free account.
As of now the site is limited to eight colleges, including Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, MIT, Simmons, Tufts, Wellesley, and Northeastern.
"From the very beginning, the goal of the site has been to take advantage of living in a true college town," Waterous wrote in an email. "While with a site like Facebook your interaction is limited to the thousand people on your friends list, with U4U we've tried to expand this social sphere to the almost 100,000 students in Boston's largest schools. Students are therefore able to take advantage of this pooling of resources to find all the best parties, marketplace items, discussion group, etc."
