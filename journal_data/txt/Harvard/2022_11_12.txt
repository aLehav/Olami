After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts-bred rapper al.divino is the epitome of what it means to be an independent artist. He is an MC in charge of his own distribution, a producer responsible for his own mixing and mastering, and a visual artist who designs his own album covers and clothing. With an ear for noisy, deconstructed sample loops and signature gruff vocals, al.divino has developed a uniquely psychedelic strain of East Coast boom-bap that has earned him a cult-following. His impressive run has caught the eye of tastemakers like Griselda’s Westside Gunn, who recently tapped al.divino to paint the cover art for his July 2022 album “Peace ‘Fly’ God.”
Growing up across Massachusetts — but primarily in Lawrence and Lynn — al.divino has spent his nearly decade-long career crafting an elusive image along with a brand of music that is not intended to be accessible. “I feel like I do a lot to not have to explain what I do,” al.divino said in a sit-down interview with The Harvard Crimson. “It’s like if you were to ask any painter, ‘How would you describe your art?’ Isn’t that why I paint?”
The rapper lets his music speak for itself — often releasing full-length projects with no prior announcement and very little post-drop promotion. Much of the rapper’s discography is only available for purchase on his bandcamp page for prices ranging from $11 to as much as $567 for a single album. An ever growing cadre of diehard al.divino fans have created an eBay aftermarket for the rapper’s vinyls with some current listings marked up as high as $435. Among his dozens of self-designed album covers, he only makes a physical appearance a few times — instead opting for images that speak to his synesthetic impression of the work.
Before he even knew what hip-hop was, al.divino was exposed to a central component of the genre: graffiti. “I started writing graffiti to a Led Zeppelin box set that my pop’s left in my crib when he left,” the rapper said. “I fell in love with graffiti before I heard hip-hop. That's my master key for everything.”
In middle school, the rapper became obsessed with classic graffiti documentaries that he found online like 1983’s “Style Wars” and “Piece by Piece” from 2005. Graffiti opened a young al.divino’s eyes to the world of hip-hop culture. “I became like a drug addict for cool shit. That’s the best way I can describe it,” the rapper said.
After finishing high school and beginning to rap, al.divino made a conscious effort to immerse himself in the hip-hop culture of the East Coast. As an escape from the monotony of home life in Massachusetts, the rapper took regular weekend trips to hip-hop centers like New York City and D.C. by commuter bus. “I'm a Greyhound legend man,” al.divino said. “Everybody knows my ‘Backpack Vino’ era. Me getting my ass up and getting on that bus to pop out to your hood. I was really soaking up culture and shit.”
Such an approach begins to explain the impressive geographic sprawl of al.divino’s recent collaborators, which range from Bay Area legend DJ Muggs to D.C. rapper ANKHLEJOHN and Griselda’s Rome Streetz in New York City. However, the place that has arguably had the greatest impact on al.divino’s music is the city just north of Boston that helped raise him: Lynn, Mass.
A manufacturing and shipping center beginning in the late 18th century, Lynn has been historically associated with crime and vice. Over the years, Lynn locals have developed an eerie rhyme that warns outsiders of the debauchery: “Lynn, Lynn, City of Sin / Never come out the way you came in.” For the last several decades, the city has been home to a budding underground rap scene, led by breakout groups like Tragic Allies. It was in 2011 that al.divino first met his now-longtime collaborator, Tragic Allies rapper Estee Nack.
The pair had a few mutual friendships, but it wasn’t until after Nack heard al.divino’s music for the first time that the two spoke. The rapper recalled an early conversation between him and Nack — who is nearly ten years al.divino’s senior — which marked the beginning of a deep collaborative partnership and friendship.
“[Nack] turned around and he goes, ‘Yo, don't ever let anybody tell you that you're not great. You are great,’” al.divino said. “This is 10 years ago. After that I basically stuck around Nack like a fly to light.”
“We bridge a generation gap by having the kind of chemistry we got,” he added.
During the same time in Lynn, Nack introduced al.divino to the Nation of Gods on Earth and to the late King Asiatic. Also known as the Five-Percent Nation or simply Knowledge Itself, the Nation is a movement influenced by Islam that was founded in Harlem in 1963. It is an ideology that is woven into the fabric of hip-hop: The group is credited with coining the term “cypher.”
Rap legends like Busta Rhymes, the Wu-Tang Clan, and the late MF Doom are a few of the most famous Five Percenters. Raised in New York by legendary Five Percenter Popa Wu, King Asiatic was the first to bring the teachings of Knowledge Itself to the Boston area. He was an incredible force for positive change in Lynn, working to turn the needle-ridden Cook Street Park into a community garden and playground. Estee Nack and al.divino were his students.
“Rest in Peace King Asiatic,” al.divino said. “He recently transitioned last year. That was like my pops man. He is remembered in perfection.”
Ever since the release of their 2016 debut collab tape “Triple Black Diamonds,” al.divino and Estee Nack have been at the cutting edge of the New England hip-hop scene. The pair’s musical collaborations combine their Five Percenter spirituality with psychedelic boom-bap production courtesy of al.divino himself as well as other local producers like Sadhugold and Grubby Pawz to create a sound that is unmistakably theirs. The duo’s approach to rap is Coltrane-esque, taking existing genre conventions in hip-hop and rearranging them at will. Nack and Divino have named this intuitive style “the splash.”
“We always called it ‘the splash,’ this kind of like formless form,” the rapper said. “It’s more of a Drunken Master type. Whether it's fast or slow it’s never predictable.”
One of the most prominent fans of “the splash” is Westside Gunn, whom al.divino says he’s known since 2016, before Griselda had ever performed in Boston. Earlier this year, Gunn enlisted the duo to work on his July album “Peace ‘Fly’ God,” giving creative control of the cover artwork to al.divino and Starker, while leaving multiple guest verses open for Nack. The album was a solid look career-wise for both al.divino and Estee Nack, but al says he really only cares about working with good people. “That’s family regardless,” al.divino said. “My relationship with Gunn is beyond rapping.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Peabody Museum on Thursday pledged to return hundreds of hair samples taken from Native American children who were enrolled in government-run schools in the 1930s and apologized for keeping the clippings in its collections.
The hair collection, amassed by anthropologist George Edward Woodbury between 1930-1933, includes samples from around 700 children spanning 300 native tribes.
“The Peabody Museum apologizes to Indigenous families and tribal nations for our complicity in the objectification of Native peoples and for our more than 80-year possession of hair taken from their relatives,” the museum’s director, Jane Pickering, said in a statement released Thursday.
The Peabody, which houses Harvard’s primary collections of anthropological artifacts, pledged to return the hair samples to families and tribal nations. The museum is in communication with tribal nations to begin facilitating the repatriation, Pickering said in an interview Thursday.
On a website the Peabody published Thursday about the Woodbury collection, it released a list of the Native tribes represented in the collection and named the U.S. Indian Boarding Schools where the clippings were taken. The museum has not made public the names of any individuals.
“We recognize that for many Native American communities, hair holds cultural and spiritual significance and the Museum is fully committed to the return of hair back to families and tribal communities,” Pickering said in the apology statement released Thursday.
Woodbury, who died in 1973, collected the hair samples while “researching potential connections between Indigenous communities to study human variation and support early anthropological theories around the peopling of North America,” according to the Peabody’s website. He left the hair samples to Harvard after he came to the school in 1935 to serve as an anthropology lecturer. They have remained in the Peabody’s collections since, housed in envelopes with the individuals’ biographical information.
Anthropological research conducted with hair samples in the early 1900s was often “carried out to support, directly or indirectly, scientific racism,” the Peabody’s website said. “Descriptions and measurements of hair types were used to justify racial categories and hierarchies.”
Woodbury published a 1932 paper based on the samples.
The returns are not covered by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which requires institutions that receive federal funding to return Native American cultural items to their original owners’ descendants.
The announcement comes roughly two months after Harvard pledged to return the human remains of 19 likely enslaved people to their descendants when it released its long-awaited report on Human Remains in University Museum Collections. The report revealed that Harvard holds the human remains of an estimated 7,000 Native Americans in its collections — despite the 1990 NAGPRA requirement that it return them to their descendants. In accepting the report’s recommendations, the school agreed to speed up its return of the Native American remains.
The Woodbury collection hair samples were taken from students in the U.S. Indian Boarding Schools, institutions established in the mid-nineteenth century at which Native American children were often abused and mistreated.
“The Woodbury collection really felt like something that should be prioritized given the significance to those communities, given the history, given the connection to the Indian boarding schools,” Pickering said in the interview Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a scorching hot start to the season, the Harvard women’s rugby team has been tested in the final stretch of their schedule, dropping two of their last three matches heading into the 2022 NIRA National Championships. The Crimson, who was previously undefeated on the season before its Oct. 15 defeat against Dartmouth, still managed to make their two losses close, with both coming down to the final minute.
After two entire weeks off from play, the Crimson came strong out of the gate in its senior game versus Dartmouth, with a try from sophomore scrumhalf Reese Morgan, followed by a beautiful solo drive by first-year center/fullback Tiana Padhilla. Another try from senior captain prop Achele Agada, along with the 10th and 11th successful conversions by junior flyhalf Brogan Mior on the season made the score a fast 19-5 advantage going into the half. This score marked the first time since 2019 that the Big Green had trailed in a game.
Unsurprisingly, reigning national champion Dartmouth, which had not lost a game in 1070 days, made adjustments at the half and closed the gap. Right out of the gate, the Big Green scored a try, leaving the score at 19-10. Soon after, however, first-year outside back Cameron Fields used her incredible speed to run the length of the field, scoring a try that put the Crimson up 26-10 following another Mior conversion. Yet the Big Green did not go away. After two quick tries, the score sat at 26-24, with the Crimson up 29-24 after a penalty kick by sophomore fullback/wing Chloe Headland. With 23 seconds to go, Dartmouth scored a tying try, with a conversion in the final seconds winning them the game. It was the first loss of the season for Harvard as well as the last time the senior class would play a home game in the regular season.
Despite disappointment against Dartmouth, the Crimson had a huge opportunity to regain momentum in their away game at Brown on Oct 22. Coach Mel Denham emphasized the team’s ability to rebound and learn from their mistakes after losses.
“Resilience is the one word that comes to mind when I think of our team,” she said. “One thing I am sure about with our team and our athletes is the ability to learn, improve and to bounce back.”
And bounce back they did, with a decisive 45-14 win. Though the Bears shot out to an early 7-0 lead, it was the only lead they would hold on the day. Tries by Padhilla and sophomore wing Kiani Akina, both followed by conversions from Headland–who showed off her consistency in going 6-6 on conversions for the day–set the lead out to 14-7. To round out the first half, outside back Victoria Stanley and back row Charlotte Gilmour continued the day’s trend of strong performances by first-year players, as they both scored tries of their own and sent the Crimson to the break up 26-7.
Unfortunately for the Bears, Harvard did not let up on the gas. Back-to-back tries from Headland, along with junior wing Maeve Humphrey’s first try of the season put the score well out of reach at 45-7. Brown would later score their final try in the waning minutes of the second half, giving the game its 45-14 outcome.
In their final game of the season, the Crimson traveled to West Point on Oct. 29 to take on Army. Despite a slow start to the match, Harvard succeeded in scoring the first try of the game: a breakaway by first-year back row/wing Lennox London that gave the Crimson a 7-0 lead after yet another conversion by Headland. The Black Knights were able to close the gap to 7-3 following a 10 minute yellow card to Harvard, and then later took the lead, 10-7. However, the Crimson, still down a player, showed off some of their resiliency, and Gilmour was able to fight into the try zone to retake the lead.
Following the half, the Black Knights showed some strength of their own. After a try to retake the lead, another penalty to the Crimson left it at a two-woman disadvantage, which Army capitalized on to extend their lead to 18-12. But Stanley wasn’t finished yet and found the try zone while still down a player, and an incredible conversion from Headland pushed Harvard to the lead again. In the final minute, however, Army was able to capitalize on another penalty, and converted, ultimately winning them the game 21-19. Coach Denham was undeterred by the loss.
“When we look back at the Army game, one thing that really stood out was our defense,” she said after the game. “We played the end of that game with 2 less players than Army (13 vs 15) and prevented them from scoring. That is the type of heart and grit that we’ll take going into this weekend.”

The Crimson will take on Army again on Saturday, Nov. 12, at 12 pm at Mignone Field for the NIRA Championships. Harvard, who fell to Dartmouth in the 2021 NIRA semifinals last year, will look to replicate their 2019 championship win this year.
“Our goal this season has been to build each week and have our last game be our best game,” Denham said. “Our talk now is around playing the way we know we are capable of, and keeping the focus on the moment.”
