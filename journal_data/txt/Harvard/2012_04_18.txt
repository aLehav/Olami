After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University of Buenos Aires Law School is an imposing white-marble structure fronted by a broad colonnade and perched above the city’s busiest traffic artery, the Avenida del Libertador. Each day 25,000 students arrive for classes there, deposited by buses on the opposite side of the avenue. A few students, perhaps late to an exam, dash across five lanes of honking, shouting, middle-finger-extending porteño drivers lurching forward in the morning rush hour. But the vast majority chooses instead to shuffle 100 meters down the Avenida, where they funnel across a colorful bridge to the law school.
In doing so, they create Buenos Aires’ most congested venue for political artwork. The bridge—an ever-changing canvas, painted and re-painted on an almost nightly basis with partisan insignia and slogans—has become the front line in a constant battle among the law school’s dozens of tireless political groups. A week ago, an anarchist fist, defiant against a blood-red sky, covered the bridge. Two days later, a communist group had whitewashed the surface, stenciling an outline of the Falkland Islands—over which Argentina has unsuccessfully claimed sovereignty for decades—where the first work had been. With each new incarnation of the bridge, one senses the parties’ hope that if they just use the right image, the right color scheme, the right slogan, their art will mobilize the legions of followers they have long sought.
Mingling art and politics is nothing new in Argentina, as a new exhibition at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires demonstrates. Titled “Claridad: La Vanguardia en Lucha” (“Clarity: The Vanguard in Conflict”), the exposition brings together art, literature, and film to explore the art of the vanguard in 20th-century Argentina, particularly through the magazine Claridad, a well-known publication from the twenties and thirties that reflected on the political and social responsibilities of art. Claridad’s editors and contributors were explicitly devoted to the development of an art that would foster social justice and create a uniquely proletarian culture.
The exhibition, though, is concerned with more than just Claridad the magazine. “Vanguard in Conflict” asks important questions about the relationship between art and society everywhere. Claridad’s contributors—who called themselves the Peoples’ Artists—went into the streets to try to understand the transformations taking place in Buenos Aires during the first half of the 20th century: the frenetic industrialization, the massive influx of immigrants, the growing urban sprawl along the banks of the Rio de la Plata. It was all captured in the essays and illustrations of the magazine.
Claridad was also distinguished by its openness to new technologies, and its editors had a particular fascination with the potential for film to serve as medium for mass communication. As a result, Claridad was among the first Argentine publications to solicit film reviews, and the exhibition accompanies those original reviews with projections of films that documented the travails of the working poor in the twenties and thirties.
In their efforts to link art and social change, however, Claridad’s contributors were not unopposed. Indeed, the twenties represented a time of disagreement among Argentina’s artistic vanguard—hence the “conflict” of the exhibition’s title. Most notably, the artists at Periodico Martin Fierro pursued aesthetic innovation and complete detachment from social conflict. “Art for art’s sake,” was their motto, and they frowned on the work in Claridad’s pages, sullied as it was by politics and poverty
For its part, Claridad viewed the art produced at Martin Fierro as devoid of content: its contributors insisted that art should communicate the revolutionary needs of the oppressed poor. Inspired by German and Russian realism, the essays and drawings published in Claridad unabashedly documented the sorrows and torments of daily life for the working poor.
The exhibition ends in the forties, with early artistic responses to World War II, but the question of art and politics in modern Argentina lingers over the entire affair. Who, the curators seem to ask, has taken up the mantle of protest art in 21st-century Argentina?
The answer, at least in part, seems to be no one. As recently as the seventies, Argentina’s dictatorship produced the unforgettable music of Mercedes Sosa, whose songs documented, from exile, the struggles of the oppressed. But it is easier to create compelling art about malevolent dictators than it is to document the horrors of persistent inflation and slow bureaucratic decay. In the 21st century, Argentina is still looking for artists who will take their art off the ephemeral canvas of a bridge and make a compelling case for social change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I couldn’t say that my roommate was too happy when, upon opening our closet, she found a giant mushroom suspended in hazy liquid. This particular mushroom—also known as a SCOBY, or Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast—was part of my kombucha tea home brew kit, merely one of many culinary tools I had randomly brought back to the apartment. First it was the free espresso maker I found left on a street in New York City—it created a far better drink than the cheapest soy cappuccino at Harvard—and now this. At least the espresso machine fit in with the room’s décor. The same could hardly be said of my gelatinous SCOBY, full of black strings, floating in a yellow liquid as if it were some abandoned laboratory experiment.
A SCOBY is a necessary part of brewing kombucha, an ancient fermented tea product that tastes of acid and vinegar. The SCOBY culture is added to a tea-and-sugar solution. After a week or two, the culture feeds on the sugar and ferments the tea. Kombucha makers claim the drink provides a number of health benefits. The drink itself can be found in glass bottles anywhere from health stores to CVS, packaged in psychedelic wrapping with flavors like “cosmic cranberry.” It sells for upwards of three to four dollars.
I first truly understood the adage “Time is money,” when I learned that the same drink could be reproduced by the gallon indefinitely for an initial investment of 50 dollars and no more than an additional dollar per brew. This money-saving technique typifies the incentives behind the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culinary movement.
Sure enough, kombucha is no exception to the trend. Homebrew kits are sold with simple instructions at the Kombucha Brooklyn tent at Brooklyn’s famous foodie market, Smorgasburg, As I sipped their ginger kombucha on draft, I noticed the proliferation of DIY in the culinary world. “It seems like we’ve come full circle,” someone nearby mused. It occurred to me that this stranger was quite right: we had surpassed the industrial and post-industrial search for convenience foods, finding ourselves in an era like the early 1900s, when baking bread and even cultivating yeast at home were common daily rituals.
A month after buying a homebrew kit from Kombucha Brooklyn, I was vigorously sanitizing my own gallon jug and cringing just a bit as I slid my slippery SCOBY into a sugar and tea concoction. Two weeks later, with immense hesitation I poured myself a glass of my first homebrew. What if I did it wrong? It didn’t smell like the pre-packaged stuff. As I brought the vinegary liquid to my lips, I yelped with joy. It was delicious. But more than that, I was amazed at all the factors that had converged to bring me this drink.
The whole experience reminded me of a meditation session with the Harvard Woman’s Club, where we were each given a morsel of dessert and told to meditate on it, to really focus on where the food had come from—all that had gone into producing it and bringing it to us—and how it smelled, felt, and tasted. The experiment exposed the mindlessness of everyday eating and reawakened my sense of awe and gratefulness for every culinary experience I was lucky enough to have. It sparked a personal connection to food, its origins, and its production.
The DIY movement fosters just that sort of reverence towards food, the earth, and those who labor on it—that we should appreciate every time someone roasts coffee beans in their home oven or plucks a leaf of basil from their windowsill garden. Somewhere in the midst of mass consumption and its plastic-wrapped vegetables, I began to take for granted our bounty of food choices and the possibilities for creating our own unique culinary experiences. But it was in that sip of my just-too-sour fermented tea that I began to appreciate it all again.

“Alright,” I announce to tonight’s band of adventurers—really a roomful of teenage boys, huddled around a pile of character sheets and 20-sided dice, but in our game they are sorcerers, bards, and fighters. I’m reading from a script, setting the scene for our adventure: “You’ve been traveling through the stark hills for several days. The trip has been uneventful, though at times you heard growling and thought you saw vague figures lurking—”
“Hey, I’m getting drunk,” one of them interrupts.
I raise an eyebrow. “Getting drunk where?”
“Right here.”
“Um, ‘right here’ is the middle of the tundra. There’s no tavern or anything.”
“Then I brought some whiskey with me.”
I doubt he actually bothered marking that down on his character sheet, but watching a fighter blunder drunkenly around the battlefield sounds amusing enough to prevent my raising any further objections. “Okay, whatever, you’re drinking whiskey. Congrats. Anyway, um.... Right, you guys thought you heard growling and saw vague figures lurking—”
“Did I mention I have a huge rack?”
“You—what?”
One of my adventurers, Howard, is pointing to the little figure that represents his character, a red-haired elf sorceress. “I’m playing a chick, and I have a huge rack. It’s very important.”
“Uh...”
“Do I get to have a huge rack? Is that okay?”
Rolling my eyes, I confirm. “Yes, you get to have a huge rack. Congrats, Howard.”
He’s positively beaming at my affirmation. I continue: “Just at dusk, you catch sight of a town in the distance: rugged but bustling, nestled in….” I can feel their attention wavering—clearly, they aren’t getting into the scene-setting I’m doing here. But I’m nothing if not adaptable: “Blah blah blah, let’s cut to the chase. There’s a bunch of wolves attacking you; what are you gonna do about it?”
And thus began another night of Dungeons & Dragons.
D&D is a singularly strange experience for the uninitiated, and it’s hard to explain the game’s appeal without sounding like some kind of Renaissance fair wannabe. Part storytelling, part spreadsheet twiddling, part strategy game, and part playacting, the game essentially goes like this: the dungeon master, or DM, tells a story describing the monsters and the perils that the heroes encounter, and the players, who are the heroes, work together to save the day. There are other rules, of course—nitty-gritty details about magic use and damage reduction and the like. But, in general, the rules boil down to whatever the players can convince the DM to let them get away with.
That means that D&D games end up being just as varied as the people involved in them. Running a campaign for a bunch of teenage guys—like I did for Howard and his “enormous rack” when I was a staff member at computer camp—is guaranteed to involve lots of tomfoolery, drunken nights in taverns, and probably some good old-fashioned bad-guy slaying, whenever they get around to it. But running a campaign for my high school friends was a totally different experience. In a circle dominated by theater-folk and art majors, we ended up spending a lot of time exploring the setting and talking with townsfolk, and a few of my friends ended up doodling sketches to chronicle our adventures.
But, whatever the character of a campaign, when it’s done right, it’s just as engrossing as any book or movie. Freshman year, I broke my solemn vow never to wake up before noon on a weekend—not because of a club or work or any other sensible reason, but because D&D started at 11 a.m., and I couldn’t stand the idea of missing even one hour of questing.
And then there’s the other end of it: serving as a DM for a pack of ravenous players. I once served as a DM for my Girl Scout troop during a cabin retreat. We played D&D for a few hours in the evening before I quit to go sleep. I woke up the next morning after being literally dragged out of my bed, because evidently everyone else was awake, and they certainly didn’t want to wait any longer to find out what would happen next.
So I ended up doing a monologue in the role of the evil sorcerer-villain while munching breakfast cereal: “What you say is of no consequence, my friends,” I sneered in my best villain voice. “You see, I haven’t eaten in a very long time, and you are my next feast.”
The outcry was uproarious and instantaneous.
“Did that guy just betray us? Oh, I am going to kick his ass so hard.”
“Wait, he eats people? That’s just naaaasty.”
“Eat someone else! Hey, let’s negotiate; I’m out of spells.”
I grinned as I munched my Lucky Charms, waiting to see what they’d do next.

The Ivy League is renowned for its tradition, but in the realm of men’s basketball, old ways seem to crumble quickly. Harvard, once considered a non-threat to win the Ivy League—not having done so since 1946—has won two titles in a row and made its first appearance in the NCAA tournament in over 60 years this year. Now, systematic as well as competitive change could be on the horizon. Last Friday, the Crimson learned that coaches are proposing plans for a four-team, two-round tournament. The winner of this tournament would represent the Ivy League in the NCAA tournament. Currently, the Ivy League is the only conference with its automatic bid to March Madness given to the regular season championship rather than the winner of a playoff.
The creation of such a tournament has the potential to be a very positive force in elevating Ivy League basketball. However, until the Ivy League can become a multi-bid conference—capable of sending more than one team to the NCAA via at-large bids—such a move would be fundamentally unfair. Simply put, the Ivy League should ensure that its best team participates in March Madness. A series of upset-prone elimination games, while garnering considerable attention for the conference, would imperil this.
To be sure, there are many valid reasons to advocate the creation of a tournament. The Ivy League would generate a lot of interest, bolstering its status in the basketball world at large. Harvard’s dramatic loss to Princeton in a special elimination game two years ago was broadcast to a national audience. In the long run, the increased visibility created by the playoffs would facilitate the recruitment of star players to our roster. However, the immediate gains from a tournament seem more commercial than competitive, with programs able to cash in on broadcast rights and ticket sales. The conference’s teams should not risk an unfair outcome for the sake of increasing the size of their wallets.
Harvard’s basketball program has undergone a remarkable ascent in recent years, demonstrating that the hype generated by a tournament is unnecessary to achieve success on the court. For instance, coach Tommy Amaker has been able to draw, without playoffs, recruiting classes that rank among the top in the nation. Meanwhile, Jeremy Lin ’10’s surprising success in the NBA has shown that Harvard basketball players are capable of competing at the highest levels—and can be expected to increase the burgeoning interest in the program.
As quality continues to improve across the board in Ivy League basketball, two teams from the Ancient Eight might make the NCAA in a matter of years. At such a time, revisiting the notion of a conference tournament would surely be warranted. However, until that scenario becomes a consistent possibility, the Ivy League should keep its current structure for the sake of fairness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s 15th Annual Latino Law Policy and Business Conference celebrated the rise of Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America, but also revealed Harvard’s most glaring weakness: After forty years, a Latino Studies  Center is still missing on campus.
Among the topics discussed at the Conference, which featured former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, was a session focused on the possibility of a Latino Studies  Center at Harvard and hosted by the Harvard Latino Student Alliance, a university-wide student organization. The session is part of a wider HLSA campaign that aims to establish a Latino Studies Center at Harvard University.
The motivation is simple: If you were a Colombian student or professor, would you go to the Argentine Center for support? If you were Ghanaian, would you get a degree in Nigerian Studies? Why should a U.S. Latino restrict themselves to issues and studies about Latin  America? It essentially neglects their experience north of the border and ignores the fact that Latinos have a range of identities that include aspects of their countries of origin and the United States.
Since 1994, the David Rockefeller  Center for Latin American Studies has been a great resource to students on campus. But the Center’s leadership also recognizes that their charter, focused on Latin America, cannot provide adequate coverage of the “U.S.” part of the Latino identity. In fact, in our Spring 2011 efforts to establish HLSA, the Rockefeller Center was unable to serve as our sponsoring entity because of this very issue. Fortunately, our application to become a university-wide organization received the support of Harvard  Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, which has been an incredible resource and partner and is a key reason why HLSA exists today.
If the proposition is so clear, then why doesn’t Harvard already have a Latino Studies  Center? For nearly forty years, students, faculty and staff have asked the same question. Earlier attempts to establish a Center in 1971, 1979, 1993, 2001, and 2005 were all rebuffed by Harvard administration.
Resistance to the creation of a Latino Studies Center has taken several different forms. One argument, called “Balkanization,” holds that focusing on a single ethnic group encourages disunity. But this argument has already been played out and found its conclusion. Nearly every other elite institution long ago established a center for Latino Studies. Both Yale and Stanford founded centers in 1977 and Columbia founded theirs in 1920.
What seems like just an academic argument is becoming an explicit strategic imperative. Harvard is simply losing out in the battle to attract and retain the nation’s top Latino talent. The Medical  School is training fewer Latinos to become future physicians than the national average, at a time when the needs of the healthcare system demand the opposite. And in 2010, Harvard ranked 3rd among elite institutions, behind Columbia and Stanford, in the number of Hispanic Ph.Ds graduated, despite graduating more Ph.Ds in total.
This inability to maintain pre-eminence among students extends to faculty as well. Harvard’s vaunted History department has been without a tenured professor of Latin American history for years. The Business School and the Law School have a dearth of faculty with core expertise on U.S. Latino issues. Of those faculty members who led previous proposals for a Center in 2001 and 2005, many have left for opportunities at competing universities.
And we have yet to mention the growth of the Latino population. By 2020, the U.S. Department of Education projects that Latinos will make up more than one out of every six postsecondary students. This will affect Harvard’s future candidate pool and therefore its campus environment. Current Latino students are disillusioned with the University’s continued refusal to make a commitment, and Latino alumni—of all schools—are growing tired as well.
But despite our frustration with the lack of support, we care deeply about Harvard. For HLSA and its members, it is as much in our interests, as well as in those of the University, to maintain Harvard’s pre-eminence among all groups domestic and international. There have been enough discussions and proposals of what a Latino Studies  Center could look like to be able to launch an initiative very quickly. All that is needed is a commitment from the University.
We urge President Drew Faust to put aside the mistakes of previous administrations and work with us in establishing, after so many years, a Latino  Studies Center at Harvard. Students, faculty, staff and alumni want it. And the University needs it.
Michael J. Trejo is pursuing a joint Master’s in Public Policy and Master’s in Business Administration at Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School, graduating in 2013. He is the President of the Harvard Latino Student Alliance, a university-wide student organization.

I was reminded of the potential of social space while studying at Cambridge University, alma mater of our own John Harvard. Three nights in, our professor invited the new students for drinks at the college pub. As we listened to him explain British crown loyalty, students played pool, bought each other drinks, and admired one man who had decided to wear a brassiere on his head. My first reaction was simply that this was a very bizarre juxtaposition of people in an enclosed space.
Then I began to appreciate the combination. When I asked students how they’d met, their most common response was something like “well, erm, I dunno, I guess I hang out in the pub, and so does she.” There didn’t have to be much else in common—no club, extracurricular, ethnicity, or assigned place of residence—just a common space to go at night.
There have been many campaigns for more inclusive social space on Harvard’s campus. Most have centered their arguments on serious moral issues, claiming that off-campus social spaces (read: final clubs) are havens for sexual assault and discriminate explicitly based on gender and often implicitly in other ways. But there are real and important benefits to creating alternative social spaces, even leaving aside the oft-addressed and weightier issues of rape and class-consciousness. A truly alternative social space would provide not just a safer and more inclusive place for drinking, dancing, and "hooking up", but it would also create an intersection of people and ideas.
This kind of environment is of particular relevance in an academic environment like Harvard, but it can exist just about anywhere. This summer, while filmmaking in rural Ghana, my colleagues and I met a farmer who had created his own center for discussion. Above a small shelter he built, Nana Owusu Achgampong hung a sign that read: PHILOSOPHERS BASE / DISCUSSIONS ALL ISSUES / EXCEPT PARTY POLITICS
Achgampong explained that this was his motto. In order to attract visitors, he bought a set of speakers and a CD player, which were playing without dampening the conversation. In order to pay for both the music and electricity, Achgampong started a business where villagers could charge their cell phones, which also served to bring people to the shelter as they waited for their phones to charge. The philosophers' base was successful—when we arrived, the shelter was filled with people.
Creating this kind of atmosphere is enormously productive, even if the foundation is simply a beer or charged cell phone. In his book “Where Good Ideas Come From,” Stephen Johnson speaks about how the best ideas often stem from the convergence of hunches within of a network of people. Hence, for example, the great number of writers and thinkers in salons and coffeehouses. It is thus particularly antithetical to the purpose of a great university that Harvard has so long struggled with social space.
It’s true, we have a few university cafés, but these are cramped and cost money. We have beloved Houses, but these are often quiet on weekend nights and do not integrate the University as a whole. The Cambridge Queen’s Head pub, Harvard’s version of the pub here in England, does an admirable job but is also limited in space and does not constitute a real center of campus life.
Meanwhile, our student center remains relatively distant and unused in the Quad. What we need is a central, spacious, and inclusive student center that is open often—especially on weekend nights. This is less impossible than it seems—the offices in Boylston Hall or University Hall could trade places with the student space in the Quad, as one of many possibilities. The University could ask for the help of alumni, as the Undergraduate Council did in the past in their attempt to buy a social space on Mount Auburn Street. However such a space is created, it would ultimately not just be safe and free from discrimination, but also home to a new, wider Harvard community.
This is the less morally pressing yet more elementary reason for a social space that anyone can enter and where everyone belongs. The others are arguably more important: In a university with a student body diverse enough that students may feel that they have little in common, a literal common ground is needed. Providing a real and equally appealing alternative to clubs that discriminate and are often the site of sexual assault should always be a priority. But even in a perfect world without these grave injustices, Harvard and universities like it should always have central, accessible social space. Such environments further the intellectual exchange and creativity that make a university valuable.

A couple of weeks ago, a large banner appeared in front of the Science Center. “Free Speech,” it proclaimed in large block letters. I moved a bit closer, confused, and saw that at the bottom it said, “Sponsored by the Harvard Libertarian Forum.” I was still confused—it seemed as if this group were making a statement, but I wasn’t sure why they felt the need to do so on Harvard’s campus because I couldn’t imagine anyone being reprimanded for expressing an opinion here. I’ve actually found myself surprised by both the variety of opinions present among the undergraduate population and the eagerness with which everyone seems to want to volunteer their opinions, leftists, liberals, and conservatives alike.
It wasn’t until I read the Crimson article about the free speech wall the next day that I learned that it was supposed to serve as a statement against Harvard’s limitations on free speech, which a member of the Libertarian Forum summarized as disallowing students from saying “discriminatory things,” but which actually consist very specifically of a ban against hate speech. In fact, the College Handbook states explicitly that, “speech not specifically directed against individuals in a harassing way may be protected by traditional safeguards of free speech.” I find the Libertarian Forum’s dedication to complete freedom of speech, regardless of whether or not the speech is harassment, alarming and indicative of a larger, troubling trend in American society.
Our nation is obsessed with the concept of freedom. The majority of U.S. citizens seem to think of theirs as the freest of all countries, and any perceived attack on this freedom is seen as a sacrilegious desecration of the Constitution, America’s holy book. However, laws, including those in the Bill of Rights, exist for a reason—to protect citizens. The provision of freedom of speech serves, accordingly, to protect people from being punished for their ideas and beliefs. However, this freedom can backfire and end up punishing people not for their ideas but for their identities when hate speech comes into play. There must be a carefully thought-out balance between freedoms and restrictions of speech in order to create a society where citizens not only feel free to express themselves, but also are free from fear and violence.
The most common argument I have encountered for unrestricted free speech on college campuses is that if we prohibit people from saying certain things, they will simply never talk about them. As a result, their prejudice and oppression—the problems that we are trying to stamp out in the first place with restrictions on speech—will continue quietly, unchecked. However, the argument goes, if we allow people to express these thoughts openly, then there will be discussion about them that leads to greater understanding. This was the view expressed by the member of the Harvard Libertarian Forum quoted in the article, and one that I think is fundamentally misguided.
There certainly should be dialogue around issues of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression. If someone has prejudices, a good way to erase these prejudices can indeed be to engage in dialogue with that person in order to understand where their attitude is coming from and educate them about the moral and logical fallacies of their prejudice. But there is also a need to protect people from having violence perpetrated against them. When someone calls a black person the “n” word out of hatred, he or she is not expressing a new idea or outlining a valuable thought. They are committing an act of violence. Speech has great power. It can—and often does—serve as a tool to marginalize and oppress people. Laws that restrict hate speech simply seek to prevent violence against marginalized, oppressed groups in order to prevent them from becoming further marginalized and oppressed.
There are freedoms to do things, and there are freedoms from things. When our freedom to speak our mind impinges on someone’s freedom from fear, or on someone’s right to feel safe in their community, then that freedom should not stand unregulated in any group that wishes to create a safe and respectful society for its members. We cannot create a respectful learning environment at our university if students from marginalized groups feel that their administration condones acts of violence against them. University regulations against hate speech are entirely necessary for maintaining respect and dignity among the student body, and Harvard’s policies to this end are well thought-out and fair—and certainly not worthy of protest.

“Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”
Ian R. McEwan, the acclaimed author who penned, among other works, “Atonement,” quoted Archimedes in his talk at the Mahindra Humanities Center on Tuesday.
Archimedes’ declaration—alluded to in the lecture’s title, “The Lever: Where Novelists Stand to Move the World”— was McEwan’s jumping off point to talk about the use of realism in his work.
“We must assume some high degree of loyalty to the levers and fulcrums—to the laws of physics,” McEwan said. “I have refused to give my characters wings.”
In the lecture, McEwan emphasized his dedication to realism as one of the defining features of his work.
“The air of reality, the solidicity,” McEwan said, “is among the supreme virtues of a novel.”
“[The lecture] really gave you a sense of how a writer considers his own writing and how a writer builds his own world,” said Homi K. Bhabha, the director of the Mahindra Humanities Center. “Here you’ve got a sense of the process of writing and how a sense of reality is created through language, through light, through incidents, through facts, through fiction.”
Throughout the lecture, McEwan read passages from his novels and letters from readers who pointed out fallacies in his works.
McEwan described a scene from his 1981 novel, “The Comfort of Strangers,” in which he describes one of his characters observing the constellation Orion in the Italian summer sky—an impossibility, since Orion cannot be seen from the northern hemisphere in the summer.
“If you want to see Orion during the summer you must go to New Zealand,” a reader wrote to McEwan.
McEwan responded aloud to his audience, “It never occurred to me that I was turning the heavens around.”
After the lecture, McEwan said that his goal for the talk was to shed light on the life of a novel from the perspective of an author.
“Once a novel is written, that’s when its life begins,” he said to the audience. “It’s not just existing in some sort of pure space.”
Michael E. Mitchell ’14, who attended the lecture, said, “I felt the talk was actually very well constructed. I liked that McEwan made it seem like he was going to be rambling with a series of anecdotes, but actually tied them together very neatly at the end of his talk.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The blazing sun means stylish shades and snappy sandals usually reserved for summer have made their way to Harvard’s campus weeks ahead of schedule. But according to many Harvard students, the warm weather has brought more than just new clothing; it has also transformed the Harvard campus.
Huadi Zhang, a first year graduate student in the Division of Medical Sciences, said that he thinks the warmer weather has created a more open and friendly community.
“It has kind of transformed the campus into a happy place,” Zhang said. “When it was cold, the campus seemed much more secluded. It’s really nice to be able to see everybody enjoying themselves: I’d never really seen that before.”
Marina Molarsky-Beck ’15, who is also a magazine comper, said that she feels more connected to a new group of students.
“It’s really nice that there’s sort of an outdoor community,” she said.  “The public spaces that were deserted in winter are really lively now.”
Theresa Tharakan ’14 said that she has noticed a marked improvement in the energy of the people around her.
“I think that this weather is a really powerful motivating force,” she said. “I know people who used to not get up for class who are going now, or people who did not exercise before who now get up and go for runs.”
However, Tharakan added that the heat does have its pitfalls.
“It is really a challenge being in a lab for 5 hours in basement when you know it’s nice outside,” she said. “Even though it’s easier to get up and go to class, it’s sometimes tougher to stay in.”
Avery E. Acuff ’14, who said she was “camped out in front of a fan”, said the heat has some negative consequences.
“I really think the college needs to invest [in] some air conditioning,” she said. However, she said that she thinks the positive aspects of the warmer weather outweigh the negatives.
“It’s definitely worth it to see everyone in a good mood,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2012, at 3:07 a.m.
When the English department rejected his application to write a screenplay for his senior thesis, Samuel D. Cook-Stuntz ’10 was not surprised.
With only fourteen spots available—two each in the genres of poetry, screenwriting, and playwriting and four in fiction and nonfiction—the odds were not high that he would be able to complete his project, initially proposed as an exploration of the lives of superheroes.
And though he had studied screenwriting on his own and even took a beginning playwriting class through the Harvard Summer School, Cook-Stuntz had never secured a spot in one of the College’s creative writing courses, a prerequisite for approval of a creative thesis proposal. When Cook-Stuntz had applied for the advanced screenwriting class earlier that year, he had been denied. His advisers had told him to expect a similar rejection when applying to write a thesis.
For students like Cook-Stuntz, the challenges of both securing a seat in Harvard’s oversubscribed creative writing classes and winning a coveted approval for a creative thesis can be both academically limiting and creatively frustrating.
Students who have participated in these classes universally praise the personal attention from time-tested faculty that the program’s small size allows, but the selective nature of even the most introductory courses leaves few options for students who haven’t made the cut.
Despite the sustained demand, semester after semester, department administrators say that their efforts to preserve the quality of teaching have made difficult any attempts to grow Harvard’s creative writing program.
“I don’t know that there’s a solution to the problem that we can find right away,” says Professor Stephen L. Burt, the department’s director of undergraduate studies. “But it’s not ideal.”
A LIMITED RESOURCE
This spring the English department offered 13 creative writing courses, including both introductory and advanced courses, that were each limited to 12 students. And with only four of these dedicated to teaching fiction, one of the most popular genres, many students say that it is difficult to improve their craft after being closed out of the department’s offerings.
Currently nine faculty members teach creative writing within the department, and the department does not employ graduate students or adjuncts to teach creative writing classes.
Department administrators say that the 12-person cap is meant to preserve the intimacy and quality of the peer workshopping experience, which serves as the centerpiece of each of the courses. To determine admissions, all of Harvard’s creative writing courses require a separate application that includes a three to five-page writing sample in the relevant genre due on the first day of classes each semester. Each student also ranks their course preferences when applying.
Students who have won seats in these classes, some after a semester or two of rejection, say the experience has been unparalleled.
“It’s not your typical, highfalutin...kind of class,” says Sayce W. Falk, a 2011 graduate of the Kennedy School who took an introductory fiction course at the College. “It stretched me in a way that almost none of my academic classes did.”
John Bryant ’13, who has taken two fiction writing classes, says that the selective nature of the class creates a more invested group of students.
“I have only glowing things to say about the professors,” he says.
But Bryant can be seen as representative of both the benefits and drawbacks of the intimate program. Although he numbers the fiction workshops among the best courses he has taken while at Harvard, it took him two tries to gain a seat in the introductory class, and his petition to write a novel for his senior thesis was recently denied.
Moreover, students who are truly interested in pursuing creative writing say that the structure of the English department, and the creative writing program’s position within it, has changed the course of their studies. It is not possible to concentrate in creative writing, and within the English concentration students can only count two semesters of these classes towards the 11 requirements of the non-honors track.
Siena R. Leslie ’12 says she would have concentrated in creative writing, not linguistics, had that been an option.
“I think the whole thing is outrageous, and Harvard should really prioritize its creative writing department and take it far more seriously,” Leslie says. “Because the courses that I’ve taken in creative writing have been among the top courses I’ve taken at Harvard in terms of quality.”
TRY, TRY AGAIN
Daniel says he has applied to “basically all” of the fiction courses that the English department offers. But for the past three semesters, this junior biology concentrator—whose name has been changed to preserve his future chances in the creative writing admissions process—has been denied.
Each time he didn’t find his name on the lists posted in the department’s Barker Center offices, Daniel contacted the courses’ professors to ask how to improve his writing for the next round of applications. His inquiries, he says, were met with one general piece of advice: “just try again.”
For students like Daniel, this guidance may not be helpful. Applications for creative writing classes are denied without any opportunity for official or even informal feedback, leaving many with the impression that natural talent or an extensive background in the subject are key to winning a spot.
A handful or so of beginners are accepted into creative writing courses each semester, according to Burt.
Bret A. Johnston, who serves as director of the creative writing program and teaches two fiction workshops, says that experience is not a factor in a student’s admission.
But while Leslie says there was a range of experience levels in the playwriting class she took in the department, she would have easily called each of her classmates real “writers” before they even stepped in the door. Leslie herself had been writing plays for several years before taking the class, and the national poet of Wales was among her classmates.
“It definitely does neglect the people who don’t have any experience,” Leslie said.
The lack of an open enrollment introductory class can be an insurmountable barrier, semester after semester, for those without any previous training.
“It’s a shame in the sense that talent shouldn’t be the only qualification for creative writing classes,” says Carla S. Ferreira ’12, who has taken two creative writing courses while at the College. “I think that pure interest...and wanting to learn the craft should be an important factor.”
For Ferreira, the problem is clear.
“It’s just that there’s not enough to go around,” she says.
A COMMON PROBLEM
Although Harvard is not alone in its lack of creative writing opportunities, recent growth at many peer institutions highlight the relative dearth of options that Harvard gives to students interested in these genres.
“Offering only limited creative writing opportunities—and those reserved for students who are already good—is very common, especially at private schools,” Alfred E. Guy Jr., the director of the Yale College Writing Center, wrote in an email. “It’s so common that those schools who do a better job really stand out.”
At MIT, for example, every student who seeks an introduction to creative writing is guaranteed a spot in a class, according to Thomas Levenson, the head of MIT’s writing and humanistic studies program.
Many other Ivy League schools similarly offer introductory courses that do not require applications.
Yale offers a “giant” creative non-fiction course that meets in 35 sections of 15 students each, according to Guy. At Harvard, only two creative non-fiction courses are offered each semester, which pales in comparison to offerings at Princeton and Yale, said Evan W. Thomas, a Princeton journalism professor who taught a program in writing during Harvard wintersession this year.
Guy adds, however, that Yale’s poetry and fiction offerings, just like Harvard’s, leave some students without options.
The programs at Yale and Princeton also outnumber Harvard in the size of their creative writing faculty. At Yale, students can concentrate in writing within the English department, and Princeton offers a certificate in creative writing, according to the program websites.
“Both of our schools have a lot of money, and nurturing your voice as a creative writer pays giant dividends for your soul,” Guy wrote.
AN OPEN INTRODUCTION
After graduating from Harvard without writing a creative thesis, Cook-Stuntz says he has mostly stopped pursuing the craft.
He never wrote his screenplay after his thesis proposal was denied. Now, he is content to kick around ideas, write notes, and “file it away in case I ever decide to come back to it.”
Although students who have taken creative writing classes agree that raising the limit past 12 students per class would reduce the effectiveness of the workshop experience, many emphasize the importance of adding more opportunities for students of all levels.
Leslie proposed that the program offer a “true” introductory class with more students, perhaps doing the workshopping in smaller sections.
The main obstacle to this solution, for both students and administrators within the department, has been concerns about quality over quantity.
“Our students have a truly remarkable record of having their work published and produced, of landing spots in the world’s top graduate writing programs with outstanding funding, and of forging stellar careers in the world of letters,” Johnston wrote in an email, adding that the personal attention from world-class writers that the current program offers would be difficult to preserve with any major expansion.
The long-term solution—the hiring of more full-time faculty or lecturers—is partially out of the department’s hands, with higher ups in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences largely responsible for such confidential, large-scale solutions.
But recently, a more immediate and perhaps revolutionary change has been put on the table. At this Monday’s meeting of the department’s student advisory committee, students proposed the creation of a large, open-enrollment introductory class. The class would be taught in a lecture format, in order to accommodate more students who have a strong desire to take creative writing.
This proposal, which is now being discussed by the department, would be a solution to “part of the problem,” Leslie said. But more importantly, it would be the first step in a much called for expansion of an already high-quality program.
“Harvard likes to be number one, and in this area, it’s not,” Thomas says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each fall, 1,600 undergraduate students matriculate into Harvard College. They are eager to learn, and when they walk into their first class, many might expect a Nobel laureate to pick up the chalk stick. Instead, many find another figure at the blackboard: the graduate student teaching fellow.
For undergraduate students, the role of the teaching fellow is an important fixture of their pedagogy. And for graduate students, teaching in a classroom is a central component of their own curriculum.
“An idea of apprenticeship is extremely important in the mentoring of graduate students,” says Terry K. Aladjem, the executive director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
The Bok Center is charged with the responsibility of creating a system for this apprenticeship. Overall, there are about 1,000-1,500 Teaching Fellows that work through the Bok Center, Aladjem says. And with a network of departmental teaching fellows—graduate students who serve as liaisons between the center and their respective departments—the Bok Center has been strengthening a structure that embraces teaching into the curriculum for its graduate students.
‘AN APPRENTICESHIP’
For Aladjem, teaching as a graduate student is not a job—it is what he calls a valuable “apprenticeship” in which the graduate learns how to teach.
“There’s a sense of legacy and the importance of apprenticeship,” Aladjem says. “It’s been a very clear idea at Harvard that our grad students are going on to be professors and should learn the profession from their professors here.”
Teaching fellows typically are third-year or fourth-year graduate students. In their fifth year, most graduate students will write their thesis.
“The Ph.D. programs work so that the first two years work as coursework,” says Odile Harter, the English departmental teaching fellow. “Then, students are often teaching for experience and consultation.”
But for graduate students, teaching in a classroom is often a learning experience. Graduate students are required to go through a graduate teaching colloquium, a two-day training session reviewing discipline fundamentals and teaching techniques.
“We have tracts for training in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences,” Aladjem says. “And we have also collaborated with the departments to create teaching practica or seminars for more sustained reflection and training.”
Graduate students also often learn through closely watching a professor instruct a class. Students will then lead a sequence of three lessons—actively soliciting undergraduate feedback throughout the process.
“We always watch the first lectures of someone who hasn’t taught before, and that’s the final part of the training,” says Robin Gottlieb, math professor of practice.
LEARNING HOW TO TEACH
As the Bok Center revamps its training of teaching fellows, it has included two elements in its curriculum to teach graduate students how to instruct their undergraduate students. Students participate in a seminar, which sometimes includes weekly discussions between teaching fellows. And departments also organize workshops for their teaching fellows.
“Graduate students are charged to run a classroom of undergraduates, to perceive the teaching dynamics in the room; we teach them how to manage it, how to manage a good conversation,”  Aladjem says.
In this process, the departmental teaching fellow plays an integral role.
“The departmental TF program is an effort to make sure that grad students in various departments get training in discipline-specific pedagogy from people in their own departments,” says Louis Epstein, former music departmental teaching fellow.
The music department has maintained a teaching fellow pedagogy program for four years, and the program meets eight to ten times during the year.
The departmental teaching fellows have also helped implement what Aladjem says he considers the Bok Center’s most effective tool—the videotaping of teaching fellows. This mechanism often provides powerful and substantive insights into a teaching fellow’s pedagogical habits.
GRADING THE TEACHING
When Q scores come in, departmental teaching fellows review the scores with the teaching fellows in their respective department. For some, however, this rubric often provides an ill form of judging effective instruction.
“The Q is sort of a blunt tool, and it’s entirely possible for a TF who is extremely effective to get a low score,” Epstein said. “We definitely take the Q seriously, and we do review results with individual TFs.”
Low Q scores, however, do prompt a response.
“There’s kind of a trigger level,” Harter says.
Teaching fellows who elicit a low Q score are referred to Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate education. According to Aladjem, Harris reviews the evaluations of the teaching fellow with the Bok Center and then consults with the professor for whom they worked. The TF is subsequently invited back to the Bok Center to improve.
“And for the most part teaching fellows who have been in that position are extremely eager to improve,” Aladjem said.

This year’s Pulitzer Awards surprised Harvard affiliates for both their conservative choices and celebration of the cutting-edge.
The Pulitzer Prize Board gave no awards in the Fiction or Editorial Writing categories, but also presented recognition to digital media outlets—Huffington Post and Politico—for the first time.
Although three authors were considered for the award in Fiction Writing, including David Foster Wallace and Dennis Johnson, no one was chosen.
The last time a fiction award was not given was 35 years ago, in 1977. The decision to withhold the award this year might be a sign of the Pulitzer’s more conservative tendencies, according to Managing Editor of the Harvard Book Review Ted J. Gioia ’12.
“The Pulitzer Prize does not have a good record of rewarding experimental and avant-garde literature,” he said, adding his surprise that “two titans... of the modern fiction scene” were not recognized.
Gioia suggested that perhaps the Board found this year’s nominees “too edgy.”
A similar situation occurred in 1974 when Thomas Pynchon’s “Gravity’s Rainbow,” considered by some to be a seminal work in the fiction canon, was supported by the three-member Pulitzer Prize jury but was ultimately denied recognition.
“They reinvest meaning in the award by taking a pause,” he said.
On the other hand, awards to both the Huffington Post and Politico mark a foray into new territory and a recognition of the growing influence of digital media.
“Original journalism, whether it’s done in traditional media or not, still counts and it still matters, and I think the Pulitzer committee recognized that,” David Skok, Nieman Fellow and a Canadian journalist, said. “[The Pulitzer Committee] looked at the stories as based in the content. That’s a very uplifting and comforting thing for digital journalists around the world.”
Borrowing a term from Harvard Business School’s Clayton M. Christensen, Skok described the way journalism is working as a “disruption.”
He referenced the increasing fragmentation of the journalism industry as social media outlets increasingly gather, produce, and distribute information.
Although the Huffington Post has received criticism for overdoing exactly this kind of aggregation, Skok suggested that it was still becoming more widespread.
“It really just suggests that these bottom end of the market publications are moving up the market,” Skok said. “I wouldn’t generalize and say that the Huffington Post is an aggregator. They do original reporting and won the Pulitzer for original reporting.”
The Pulitzers are often called the Oscars of the journalism industry.
“I think as all of our industry continues to go through disruption, awards and accolades are nice, but the overall trend and sentiment is more important—the overall quality of investigative reporting,” Skok said. “The Pulitzer helps some publications get some exposure, but it’s not the be all end all.”
Other awardees included Harvard English professor Stephen Greenblatt who won the Pulitzer for Nonfiction.
“I’m thrilled for him,” Skok said. “Anytime a Harvard faculty (member) wins an award, it’s a celebration for the entire community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When people ask Edward C. Meier what it takes to be a referee in his conference, he gives them a parable. Meier is the Ivy League’s coordinator of women’s basketball officials, and it is his judgement that will make or break an official’s career.
“Imagine you’re in a crowded gym,” he said. “It’s so raucous, so loud, that when you blow your whistle you can barely hear it. You’re in that game and there’s three seconds left in the game, and a foul is called. The crowd roars. To your left is a coach who is irate and gesturing. To your right is a coach who is irate and gesturing. Well, one of the officials, seeing this immediately bends down and ties their shoes. Another official says, ‘let me go dry off the basketball.’ The person who goes over to the coaches, with their chin up, shoulders back, is the Ivy League official.”
These officials are an invisible part of the game—seeing plays but not disrupting them, anticipating and defusing conflicts between players and coaches.
For female officials in the Ivy League, the context of their job is even more complicated, as many juggle multiple roles. During the game they are the black-and-white shirt who made a controversial call late in the fourth quarter, but afterward they are mothers who rush home to tuck their kids in at night and are office employees who arrive at work at 9 a.m. after a night of exhilarating play.
Also, since there are no female officials in men’s Ivy League basketball, female referees bring a gender aspect to the women’s game. In this sense, officiating is a way to strengthen the lineage of the comparatively young sport of women’s basketball—the full-court game was not adopted until 1971, and the first woman was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985.
While officiating has a lot of positive attributes, few people spend their childhood dreaming of being a referee.
In the case of Geraldine Smith, who referees in the Ivy League, several other Division I conferences, and the NBA Development League, she fell into it upon the suggestion of a veteran official.
“I was playing golf one day, and somebody I was playing with was an official,” Smith said. “He said I looked like I used to play basketball and asked me if I had ever thought about refereeing. I then got hooked.”
The roots of this devotion are deep in student athletics. Smith, for example, averaged 18 points a game at Seton Hall and is a member of the University’s Hall of Fame. Maggie Tieman, another female official, was recruited to the University of Vermont for basketball, ended up playing softball, and now works as a health and wellness teacher and coach at Lewis Mills High School.
Yet, in order to go from player to becoming an official, and not to being a coach or merely a basketball parent, one has to have something extra, a certain love for exacting certitude and order from difficult situations.
“I’m a really black-and-white person to begin with, no pun intended,” Tieman said. “Officiating really gels with that. Either a foul or it’s not. Either it’s out of bounds or in bounds.”
Meanwhile, developing the skill and endurance of a top official requires an extraordinary amount of behind-the-scenes effort. All referees in college basketball have one-year contracts, and they work under constant awareness of the annual review.
The NCAA pushes this feedback loop even harder. After each game, the league sends referees a DVD of their performance. They are expected to watch it and break down their calls and positions. Why was a wrong call made? How could a situation have been defused more quickly? Additionally, officials must attend an annual rules clinic where they must pass a test on their knowledge of standard basketball guidelines. Throughout the year they also take quizzes based on plays that happened that season.
“The scrutiny is pretty intense,” Meier admitted.
Most importantly, they attend summer camps where they are watched and evaluated by veteran officials from different Division I conferences. Just as an invitation to a major camp is a way for promising basketball players to be seen by influential coaches and scouts, these summer camps are also strategic opportunities for promising referees.
Meier is one of the scouts in the stands at these camps. He says he travels 15 to 25 days a month during the summer, seeing close to 500 officials. If he likes someone’s calls and demeanor on the court he will ask for their resume and speak to a coordinator in their current league. And then, come August, official number 27 on court 23 might have a coveted one-year contract with the Ivy League.
“We’re independent contractors, so part of your goal every year is to get your contract again,” Terry Funk said. “I hope I ref well enough that the boss thinks well enough of me.”
Because there is so much review, the ability to be relentlessly self-critical is key.
“The amount of time we spend thinking about a play is double the time of the actual play,” Tieman said.
If she has an off night, she will go watch another official. She subscribes to Referee magazine, and studies different personality and leadership styles.
“I absolutely love it,” Tieman said. “There’s not a moment that goes by that I’m not thinking about the game.”
But such a devotion has its tolls.
Ivy League officials must be at the location of a game one and a half hours before tipoff in order to confer with the other two people on the officiating team that night. Female officials often manage these time imperatives with their day jobs and roles as primary caregivers.
“We have a saying in officiating: The hardest part is getting to the game,” Smith said.
Ivy League officials are compensated $500 a night, plus their transportation costs and a per diem. This amount is more than it used to be—when Meier started officiating the pay was $25 a night—but it is less than the $2000 that the Atlantic Conference pays and the work season is only October to April. As such, many officials have other professions. Smith, for instance, has a full-time job as a health insurance agent.
“I’ll do everything I can in terms of getting my work down, and my coworkers are really good at helping,” she said. “I use my vacation time when I do have a basketball game. So far it’s working, but it’s very, very challenging.”
Such a daunting travel schedule can affect family life as well. Being a great referee who is constantly improving and landing spots in higher conferences is not necessarily conducive to starting a family.
“It’s a lot easier for me because I’m single and don’t have children,” Smith said. “My family just knows from the months of October to April I’m pretty much all over the place.”
In other cases, with a full-time job, officiating career, and active family role, often something gives. For Funk, who has five boys under the age of seventeen, it was her day job that suffered.
“When I had my third son, I gave up my full-time job in engineering and decided to just referee,” she said. “For four to five months of the year it’s very hard to manage, but it gives me five to seven months of the year where I’m with my kids all the time, which is a wonderful gift for me.”
And her kids are supportive of their mom’s job.
“If I’m at Penn or Princeton they’ll take a ride down,” Funk said. “They think it’s kind of cool; not all of their friends’ moms are into sports.”
All the work is in the hopes of both maintaining a spot in the Ivy League and landing a spot in other ones.
Smith also officiates in the NBA’s Development League, a veritable fishbowl for players, coaches, and officials looking to make it at the highest level of men’s basketball.
Tieman is looking to be on the staff of the Big East next year, contingent on her performance at the summer camps. Funk is currently officiating in four Division I conferences and would like to add a fifth.
But both of these women show loyalty to the particularities of Ivy League basketball, where the pay and prestige may be lower but also where every game counts.
“The biggest thing from a sports perspective is that [Ivy League basketball doesn’t] have a seat in a conference tournament,” Funk said. “So the Harvard-Dartmouth game in January could have an enormous impact on whether they play in the postseason. Not many conferences have that. Every game is a championship game.”
And despite the high tensions and screams from coaches and the players during intense games, the black-and-whites say they still feel appreciated. The coaches are remarkably professional, they say, and the student-athletes are very polite. As a result, the referees put forth their highest dedication.
“In the 25 years I’ve done this, we’ve never had an official miss a game,” Meier said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In honor of our campus’ so-called “music festival,” we at the Crimson decided to rank the biggest letdowns in Harvard’s calendar year thus far.
5) ECAC Hockey Championships
Both the men’s and women’s hockey programs were a win or two away from making the NCAA championships. After beating the perennial power, Cornell, the men’s squad lost to Union, 3-1, in the ECAC championship game. Had the Crimson emerged victorious, it would have guaranteed itself a spot in the field of 16.
Going 17-4-1 in the one of the toughest divisions in college hockey, the women’s side should seem like it did enough to guarantee itself an at-large bid. But after an overtime loss in the ECAC semifinals, Harvard was stopped in its tracks, and junior forward Jillian Dempsey’s unprecedented scoring run came to a premature ending.
4) Harvard spikeball
In a year of firsts for Harvard sports, one first is a little different than the rest. Crimson fans everywhere were on the edge of their seats when Harvard spikeball played its first-ever intercollegiate match this past fall. Unfortunately, the event ended in disappointment, as the Crimson fell to Dartmouth.
3) Men’s soccer
The men’s soccer team was, in a word, disappointing this year. The team finished 0-6-1 in the conference and 2-12-3 overall. Despite providing some feel-good stories including the crowd-friendly season-opening, 1-0, victory over Northeastern, disappointing moments, such as senior goalkeeper Austin Harms’ failed flirtation with the school shutout record, marked the men’s soccer’s 2011 campaign.
2) Penn vs. men’s basketball game: Penn 55, Harvard 54
The Crimson held a late 49-40 lead with 7:56 left in the game. The 11-point-favorite just needed to take care of business in order to keep destiny in its own hands in the Ivy League. But on the back of Zach Rosen’s 11 points in the final six minutes and stellar team defense, the Quakers pulled off the stunning comeback. The letdown was only amplified by the fact that Harvard fans had thought they had won for a couple seconds before it was revealed that a charge disallowed a would-be go-ahead Kyle Casey bucket. The saving grace: the Crimson went on to take sole possession of the Ivy League title anyway as Princeton defeated Penn in the rivalry game on its senior night.
1) Yardfest
In the end nothing could measure up. In what is billed as one of the college’s premier social events, Harvard could muster nothing more than mediocre food on a Sunday afternoon. Whereas our peer institutions like Penn and Yale were able to draw the likes of Tiesto and T-Pain, Harvard couldn’t even draw a headliner with a Wikipedia photo. Yardfest’s professional opening performers, including one group who called the student body responsible for his being there things that should not be repeated in print, drew a non-existent crowd. On the plus side, we did have a tire swing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard baseball team suited up for a game against UMass at LeLacheur Park, the Crimson was met with favorable results.
The year was 2005—Harvard’s most recent Ivy championship season—and a strong Crimson squad took down the Minutemen by a comfortable 11-5 margin, securing a spot in the Beanpot finals. The following day, on April 21, Harvard handled Northeastern, 7-3, at Fenway Park to claim its second-ever Beanpot title.
Since the stellar 2005 campaign, the Crimson has yet to reclaim either the Beanpot or the Ivy crown. But Wednesday evening, some of that might change. Harvard is pitted against the Minutemen in the Beanpot finals—the Crimson’s second trip to the title game in as many years—and, once again, Harvard (8-25, 4-8 Ivy) will take on UMass (11-13, 6-3 Atlantic 10) at the home of the Lowell Spinners.
The Crimson and the Minutemen met most recently in the opening round of last year’s Beanpot. And after eight scoreless innings, Harvard was able to squeak out a win, as then-sophomore Danny Moskovits drove in then-freshman Jack Colton with a single in the bottom of the ninth, securing a 1-0 victory and a trip to the finals.
“It’s going to be a good matchup,” sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan said. “We played them well [in the Beanpot] last year, but they’re a different team now, and we’re a different team. We can’t take this one lightly.”
The Crimson also enters Wednesday’s contest with retribution on the brain. After sneaking by the Minutemen in its first 2011 Beanpot matchup, Harvard suffered an 8-0 defeat at the hands of Boston College under the lights at Fenway Park. With the win, the Eagles secured their second Boston-area championship in as many years and 10th overall—the highest Beanpot title count of any participating school.
After losing to BC, the Crimson dropped its final four matches of 2011, falling  to 9-36 on the year.
“We’re definitely on a better pace this year than last year,” McGuiggan said. “Hopefully [on Wednesday] we can pick up that ninth win, which is the number we ended up with last year. That will put us in a good position to get into double digits over the weekend.”
Harvard went 3-3 this week—its best mark of 2012—taking down BC for the second time in as many games and notching two wins in a four-game series at rival Yale.
“Even though we lost those two games to Yale, the games were close and we played well,” McGuiggan said. “[This past week] definitely gives us some momentum and also confidence.”
After leading the Crimson with a .458 batting average over the course of the last six games, McGuiggan earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors—the first time a Harvard player has earned the nod since Tyler Albright ’11 captured a share of it on April 27, 2010.
UMass—led by Anthony Serino’s 25 hits and 14 RBI so far on the season—has won five of its last seven games and currently sits tied for third place in conference play. The Minutemen also have a recent win against Northeastern—a team that downed Harvard, 9-4, in a midweek tilt last Tuesday.
“Last week started off well,” freshman centerfielder Mike Martin said. “But we had a little let down against Northeastern. Going into the weekend, we knew if we swept Yale or at least took three games from them, we’d be in a great position. Unfortunately, we only won two, but we’re still sitting in second place [in the Rolfe division].”
Although Harvard leads the all-time series, 26-16, UMass holds a 7-4 edge in Beanpot matchups.
And according to Martin, the non-conference contests like the Beanpot also serve as tune-ups for upcoming Ivy League games.
“[Midweek games] help you stay fresh during the week, and pitchers can get their work in,” Martin said. “The intensity is not 100 percent at the level of an Ivy game, but it’s definitely there. A win during the week can give you great momentum for the weekend.”
Regardless of the outcome of Wednesday’s game, Crimson players say they relish the opportunity to compete for Boston-area bragging rights.
“The Beanpot for hockey is a lot bigger than it is for baseball, and a lot of people don’t know about it,” McGuiggan said. “But it’s an opportunity for us to go out and win a trophy and a championship.”
“It’s a two-game championship, that still means something to us, especially to get back to the championship game for the second straight year,” he continued. “We lost in the finals [last year] and don’t want to let that happen again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The annual crosstown battle between the Harvard softball team and Boston University on Tuesday was much more ‘High Noon’ than ‘The Departed’. Under a blazing sun reminiscent of the Southwest, Crimson hurlers Rachel Brown and Laura Ricciardone dueled through the afternoon with Terrier ace Holli Floetker, but a sixth-inning BU sacrifice fly was all Floetker would need as the Terriers defended their territory with a 1-0 win.
A low-scoring affair was all but guaranteed when Harvard (24-11, 11-1 Ivy) traveled a mile and a half to face BU (25-13, 8-3 America East).
After both teams combined to score 22 runs two years ago, it was Ricciardone and Brown who came out on top in a 2-1 battle on the Terrier’s turf last season. So this time around, Floetker was out for revenge.
The reigning America East Pitcher of the Year struck out nine Crimson batters while surrendering three hits on the afternoon. Only one Harvard hit touched the outfield grass.
“Our hitters knew going into the game that they were going to have to make an adjustment from Yale pitching to BU pitching,” Brown said. “[Floetker] effectively used her strengths against us and we as batters didn’t take away those strengths.”
Brown, the notorious gunslinger with a villainous arsenal, was nearly perfect in her own right to start the game. In four innings of action, the senior struck out six and gave up only two hits. She has now given up just two runs in her last 14 innings of work stretching over four appearances.
When Ricciardone entered the fray in Brown’s stead in the bottom of the fifth inning, there was anything but a drop-off. The sophomore started the inning with a three-pitch strikeout on three perfectly placed offerings on the outside corner. She proceeded to end the inning on another strikeout and a groundout.
“Both Rachel and Laura did a great job today, virtually shutting them out,” coach Jenny Allard said. “I thought the game ball goes to Rachel and Laura; they looked great today, and BU is a good hitting team. They are scoring a lot of runs.”
Early on, the game appeared to be headed in a different direction, as BU’s third hitter, Megan Volpano, crushed a potential home-run ball to left field that fell at the base of the wall for a double. But a Terrier runner wouldn’t touch second base again until the sixth inning.
That frame started with BU’s No. 9 hitter, Melanie Delgado, driving a ball right up the middle towards Ricciardone, who was unable to corral it as the ball caromed off her glove. Kendra Meadows was sent in to pinch run for Delgado, and she soon found herself on second after third baseman Kasey Lange failed to cleanly field a bunt by Jayme Mask, leaving runners on first and second. A sacrifice bunt later, the runners were on second and third with one out.
Next up was Volpano, the only player in the game to reach base twice (on the first-inning double and a subsequent walk). The righty drove a fly ball to center, deep enough for Meadows to tag up when the ball was caught and score easily from third. Ricciardone got out of the inning on the next batter but not before the damage was done.
Initially, it appeared that the Crimson would respond in the sixth inning. A hit batter sandwiched by two singles­—all with two outs—left the bases jammed and sophomore catcher Allison Scott at the plate.
But after lacing a ball that sliced foul, Scott ended the two-out rally with a grounder to second. After crossing the plate for what she thought might have been the first run of the game, senior Jane Alexander watched Scott reach first base a step after the ball did.
After the game, Allard said she didn’t consider sending a pinch hitter in for Scott, who’s hitting .238 on the year.
“She had two great at-bats against [Floetker], she was on the ball,” Allard said. “If anybody was going to come through, it was her. And she hit it solid; it was just six inches foul.”
In the seventh, the Crimson was unable to mount any sort of last-inning charge as they went down 1-2-3 to end the game.
“We need to be a little more disciplined at the plate against a little quicker pitching, but we aren’t going to see that level of pitching again,” Allard said. “It was a great game, a back and forth pitching duel.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The post-surgery rehabilitation of Jeremy Lin ’10 just got a little better. On Wednesday morning, Time magazine announced that it included Lin among its annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.
Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, wrote Time’s entry on Lin, commending him for his work ethic and academic success.
“[Lin has dismissed the thought that] being a world-class athlete on the court is somehow at odds with being an excellent student off the court,” Duncan wrote. “Contrary to what you might read, Jeremy, 23, is no overnight sensation—In fact, he achieved success the old-fashioned way: he earned it. He worked hard and stayed humble. He lives the right way; he plays the right way.”
Duncan, however, did not ignore the storyline of Lin’s ethnicity playing a role in his recent popularity.
“He's dispelled the idea that Asian-American guards somehow couldn't hack it in the NBA,” Duncan explained.
Shortly after receiving the news, Lin’s New York Knicks teammate Steve Novak tweeted: “Congrats to @JLin7 on being named one of TIME’s 100 most influential people! #ThatsMyTeammate” to which Lin responded “Now im blushing…”.
Lin’s fellow list members include Tim Tebow, the New York Jets’ famously religious backup quarterback to whom many have compared the also-religious Lin, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and president Barack Obama.
Lin’s selection culminates an extremely turbulent year for the former Harvard co-captain, in which, somehow, he has traded getting released from teams for press releases. While it may be true that with his recent knee surgery Linsanity has officially ended, it seems that there is now a more appropriate word to describe the Harvard alum: Linfluential.
