After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early last week, the Presidential Search Committee sent out a message to students asking for advice and nominations for the next president of Harvard University. After current University President Drew G. Faust steps down at the end of this academic year, we’ll  try to learn from the past and improve on the future. As the search to fill the position begins, we should look to devoted grassroots organizers as inspiration for the kind of person that our next president should be.
Activists are not complacent. Activists put the needs of their communities first. They put their lives on the line for the things they believe in. Activists aren’t afraid to speak their mind and share their own stories.
An activist would put the students first. While people  joke that the president works under students living in Massachusetts Hall, this is how it actually should be. The president’s job is to serve the students.
Given the current presidential administration, we need Harvard’s president to advocate for students. Harvard needs someone who will fight for students’ right to education when it is under the care of an unqualified and unskilled government. We need someone who will not only advocate for students in Washington, but also assure them that they will have all their needs met on campus.
We have seen instances of presidents failing their students in the past. We saw it in 2003 with President Summers. When he had to choose between protecting students from outright discrimination under the Solomon Act and federal funding, he picked the latter. Summers allowed military recruiters on campus, showing support for discriminatory policies against members of the LGBTQ community such as the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
Students were similarly failed again last year. After meeting with students who clearly vocalized the need for Harvard to be a sanctuary campus, Faust refused. After rallying in support of that status, students were dismayed to learn that the University was not willing to ensure their safety and calm their anxieties over the possibility of being detained on their way to class.
We need an activist who will support the student body no matter what. We need a president who will not give up on what’s important to the people because nobody should have to compromise their identity and well-being. We need a president who will make sure that students feel safe in their home and have all the resources available to them that they need to continue succeeding. This country already has a shortage of them.
We need someone who will not claim to know what’s best for their students by ignoring what those students—who are actually best positioned to know—are asking for. We need a president who will invest wisely, not using unethically gained investment returns to fund some students’ education at the expense of others. Our president should listen to students’ calls for a multicultural center. They should hear our calls for a bridge program. They should listen to our calls for more culturally competent and accessible mental health counselors.
The president should make sure that all students feel safe on campus. They must provide extra support for students coming from underprivileged and marginalized communities. They should not allow hate speech on campus to ensure that a toxic environment is not getting in the way of those students’ education. They must stop trying to suppress students by pretending to care and meeting them with empty promises.
We need a president who will be incessant in the fight for justice and use Harvard’s position of influence to mobilize the rest of the country to action.
And, finally, given that so many social activists and students affected by the current state of our country are people of color, maybe it’s time Harvard finally has a non-white president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reality TV, in all of its pre-scripted, overly edited glory, is an escape of sorts. After a busy day of readings, club meetings, and exhausting social interactions, I like to open up my laptop and soothe myself with it. Sometimes I turn on E! to Keep Up with the Kardashians. Other nights, “Say Yes to the Dress” gives me the day of wedding dress shopping I’ll never have. On warm summer evenings, “Big Brother” transports me into a house of romance, lies, and competition.
The shows are different enough from my own life, but with the potential to be like mine if a few things in my life had gone a bit differently, making them engaging. I, like many Americans, do not watch reality TV because it reflects my daily life or what I aspire to have. I indulge in it because it offers a retreat from the hardships and monotony of everyday life. In the past few months though, the exploitation of racial conflict has tainted reality television.
On a recent episode of “Big Brother,” one of the contestants referred to a fellow contestant, Alex Ow, as “Pao Pao.” The nickname was a reference to former Big Brother contestant Paola Shea who, like Alex Ow, is an Asian American woman. A third contestant, Megan, misheard the conversation and told Alex that they’d referred to her as “Panda.” “Isn’t that a little racist?” Megan asked, putting her into the center of a racial controversy. The person who called Alex “Pao Pao” defended herself, saying she’d never said “Panda,” and she got away scott free. No one addressed that she’d played into the overplayed, racist idea that all Asians look the same.
“The Bachelorette” recently made made headlines for choosing Rachel Lindsay as its first black female lead. With her came one of the most sexist, racist, and bigoted male suitors the show has ever seen—Lee. To advertise an episode, the producers of the show put together a teaser that made it seem that Kenny, a black contestant, got into a physical fight with Lee. What actually happened was much more muted verbal conflict and a discussion about why calling black men “aggressive” is racially charged.
Racial strife is centered in American political consciousness in a way it hasn’t been since the late 1960s. Reality TV is trying to package racial awareness into bite-size pieces for their consumers, but they’re failing because racial violence is too real for too many people. When it comes to addressing oppression, reality television fails because it takes experiences familiar to Americans of color and strips them of their context without offering solutions.
If we want to learn about racial violence, we can turn to documentaries backed by extensive research and personal narratives, not E! Network or TLC. When white Americans watch “13th,” Ava DuVernay’s documentary on slavery and mass incarceration, it’s likely that they leave having learned something. It’s difficult to leave a screening of the documentary without a greater sense of awareness surrounding black strife. I can’t say the same about “The Bachelorette.”
Dealing with race through a reality television lens isn’t just passively ineffective—it’s actively counterproductive. A child does not wake up and randomly decide that someone of a different race is inferior to him. He learns it from the things the adults in his life say, whether it be about how Mexicans are criminals or how all black people live in poverty. When racial conflict is shown on TV, even if only in the form of verbal disputes, it desensitizes viewers and subconsciously makes them think that racism is commonplace, acceptable, and something to simply be watched.
We can’t afford to grow numb when racism is leaving black mothers childless throughout the country. Innocent Latinx people’s skin color puts them at a higher risk of racial profiling as racism informs sloppy, ineffective legislation. For too many people, racial violence is not relegated to the news or movies. It takes their neighbors, draws blood, and rips apart communities. Americans who are not at risk of racial violence watch videos of police officers shooting Americans or ICE agents ripping families apart but do little about it. Now, this passive consumption of racial suffering is making its way onto reality television.
No one’s been under the impression that reality television represents the world as it is. When networks use racism as a way to get people to watch reality television shows, it trivializes the ways racism actually devastates the lives of people of color. We simply can’t afford to accept racism as a phenomenon to be watched rather than fought. The stakes are too high for us to trade justice for ratings.

Flyby here, making sure you’re not letting your summer fly by! This week, we’re bringing you suggestions for some summer classics. From outdoor movies to sandcastles and ice cream, this is a week to escape the monotony of the Square and enjoy all that the greater Boston area has to offer.
Farmers Market in Central Square
Monday, 12-6 p.m. | Parking lot behind H-mart in Central Square
If the burrito-pizza-burger diet of the Square just isn’t cutting it, venture outside the Harvard Bubble to visit the Central Square Farmers Market. Every Monday, the market offers everything from seafood and pork to fresh produce and juice. While it might seem out of the way, the market puts your local CVS to shame with its variety, Cantabrigian-ness, and quality.
Back to the Future outdoor screening
Tuesday, 7 p.m. | Wharf District Park at the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway in Boston (Red Line to South Station stop, then walk)
Let your cares McFly away at an outdoor screening of this 1985 classic. Doc might give you some ideas about building a time machine to take you back to the beginning of summer, but we would advise against trying. Insead, kick back and enjoy the summer evenings we still have left.
Vegan ice cream in Somerville
Wednesday, 6-8 p.m. | Powder House Square, Somerville (Red Line to Alewife stop, then walk)
Whether you’re overjoyed that someone is finally serving ice cream that adheres to your dietary restrictions, or you’re just looking to mix it up, Somerville is the place to be this Wednesday evening. Head on over for some free, frozen treats at this “Vegan Ice Cream Social,” and don’t forget to bring your own bowl and spoon!
Romeo and Juliet on the Boston Common 
Wednesday-Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m. | Parkman Bandstand, Boston Common
Free plays! Free plays! Where art thou, free plays? Methinks there are multiple this summer on the Boston Common. Starting this Wednesday, Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet will be performed every night except Mondays through August 6th. Whether you’re a Shakespeare superfan or you just want to impress a date, all you have to do is take the Red Line to Park Street, lay down a blanket, and enjoy the most tragic love story of all time.
Free Fun Friday at the MFA
Friday from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. | Museum of Fine Arts (Red Line to Green Line E train to Museum of Fine Arts stop)
Harvard students can get into the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston for free anytime, but—let’s be honest—you’ve never gone. Well, this Friday, you have no more excuses. Not only is the MFA free for all (so you can bring along a non-Harvard friend), but there are special art activities, like printmaking and drawing in the galleries. The Yard may be pretty, but it’s not a Jackson Pollock original.
Cheaper by the Dozen outdoor screening
Friday at dusk | Boston Harbor Hotel (Red Line to South Station stop, then walk)
Have you had enough of Steve Martin? No, you haven’t—you can never have enough of Steve Martin. Cheaper by the Dozen (a.k.a. the most indisputably Oscar-snubbed movie of all time) is playing outdoors at the Boston Harbor Hotel this Friday, so you won’t have to suffer from your Martin withdrawals any longer.
Salsa Party in Harvard SquareFriday, 7-10 p.m. | Brattle Plaza
Head into the Square this Friday for salsa samples and salsa dance lessons. Complete with tunes from DJ D. Martinez, the Brattle Plaza will be transformed into a lively dance floor for one night only—don’t miss it!
Sand Sculpting Festival at Revere Beach
Friday-Sunday, 10-8 p.m. | Revere Beach (Red Line to Orange Line to Blue Line to Wonderland stop, then take the 411 bus to the Jack Satter House @ Revere Beach stop or walk)
End your week with a quintessential summer activity: sandcastle building. It takes about an hour to get to Revere by public transportation, but it’s worth the journey for a day at the beach surrounded by gravity-defying sand creations.
