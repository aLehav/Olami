After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maria made potato fritters. The recipe called for a pound of potatoes, two eggs, half a cup of flour. It was a recipe for latkes originally. Maria wasn’t Jewish, but she had gone to take out the trash just a half an hour before, and something in the blueness of the night, the needling of December into her face had sprouted this idea in her. In the winter months, potatoes lived in a mesh sack in the corner of the garage. She had reached a hand inside and touched some potatoes near the top that had rotted soft. Disgust spread through her chest. Even in the garage, her breath clouded white in the air.
She didn’t want to measure out a pound, just prodded around until she felt she had enough firm potatoes. They would only be for her and Lai, anyway. Lai was usually meandering through the internet at this hour, though whether he was catching up on the day’s news or giggling at memes she wasn’t sure. He didn’t come out of the office as she set a pot of water to boil. She cut each potato in half first, inspecting for black blooms within the flesh. She didn’t trust the recipe, that potatoes would cook sufficiently in hot frying oil if not boiled first. The texture came out mealy, like mashed potatoes, instead of the fine shreds of real latkes. She called them fritters.
They didn’t taste bad. She salted them straight out of the oil and took a plate to Lai. He sat in a dark office and didn’t look away from the screen when Maria turned on the light.
“What’s this?”
“Try it.”
He started to pick one up. “It’s hot,” Maria said. He blew on it, mouth ovaling around the stream of air. After a bite, he licked salt off his lips.
“How is it?”
“Good. Too salty.” He looked at the plate in her hands. The square of paper towel beneath the mound of fritters leaked, yellow and greasy. Only its edges retained some white.
“Are those for me?”
“Not all of them.” Maria smiled. “Should I go put some on a plate for you?”
“Why’d you bring all of them here if I can’t eat all of them?”
Maria shook her head. She bent her face to the screen. “What’s this?” she said. “‘The New York Times?’”
“Just some culture stuff.”
She put down the plate and started to reach for the mouse. “We don’t have a subscription.”
He tossed the last bite of fritter into his mouth. “I’m using my parents’.”
She shifted her hips to position herself to better to scroll through the article he’d been reading as he stretched across her for another fritter, his arm connecting with her torso on one side, the table on the other. The plate clattered to the floor. The fritters landed with the heaviness of uncooked meat.
They bent down at the same time, saw the smoke expanding into the room at the same time. The fire alarm went off. Maria thought of babies. The alarm continued. Lai ran to the kitchen. Maria followed, crouching, elbow jammed across her mouth. The smoke around the stove was thick gray, but she could see the color of the fire that sprayed out of the frying pan. The flame she had left on, normally blue beneath the pan, had been consumed by orange.
“Wet some towels!” Lai’s words came through in a spiral as he ran to get the fire extinguisher.
Maria could only find the white tea towels some friends had given them for their marriage. She ran them under the faucet. The smoke thickened.
“The towels!” Lai yelled.
Later, when she and Lai were hunched against the door of the ambulance sent alongside the firetrucks, she wondered about the din of fire. They’d yelled. Lai and she both, when she’d dialed 9-1-1. The operator had told them to get out of the house.
“We need to get out of the house,” she’d yelled to him.
She remembered how the smoke alarm had shaken up through her bare feet. But she didn’t remember the fire as loud. Loud, maybe, compared to the silence in the ambulance, she and Lai on one side, a teenaged volunteer pretending to study a chart on a clipboard on the other. Loud, maybe, compared to the way silence seemed a solid thing as they waited for the firemen to deem the house safe to reenter.
“We’re fine,” Lai kept telling everyone.
She thought maybe the smoke had been loud. She could smell it on herself. Lai had asked for a tissue. The mucus had been black.
“Look.” He had shown her.
She wished for that loudness now, back in the house. Ash dimmed every surface to grayscale. Windows had been opened for the smoke to leave. Black footprints from the firemen tracked all around the house, each one smudged in a distinct way.
She felt she should say something to Lai. Some kind of sorry, a gift of guilt.
He’d stood in the kitchen with her, looking at the scorched stove. Then he’d gone upstairs, leaving the windows wide, where she knew she’d find the shape of his indifferent body in their bed.

The artists:
For better or for worse, metaphors abound in artistic discourse. Composer John Cage calls music “a means of rapid transportation”; novelist Theodore Dreiser deems art “the stored honey of the human soul”; painter Eugène Delacroix sees it as “a bridge linking the painter’s mind with that of the viewer.” In the words of these renowned artists, art becomes a condiment in a jar or a piece of urban infrastructure. What is the role of metaphors like these in our understanding of the creative process? Do such metaphors detract from or enhance the quality of art?
Several artists have argued that metaphor, rather than providing descriptive clarity, only further increases the gap between the genuine nature of art and what can be successfully communicated to a popular audience. Poet and essayist T.R. Hummer writes that metaphor “may allow or even encourage us to forget literal truths.” In fact, the past two centuries have seen the advent of many abstract artistic movements that were arguably founded on the desire to eradicate all metaphor. Inherent in abstractionist philosophies seems to be the notion that art is capable of transcending this dependence on references to everyday experience and of existing on a higher, untouchable plane. However, what brings together Miriam Huettner ’17 and Sam Wu ’17—both immensely thoughtful, talented artists in their sophomore year at Harvard—is their mutual appreciation for metaphor as a facilitating, rather than reductive, force in artistic creation and collaboration.
Miriam embraces a metaphor for art that I had never heard before: that of excavation. This metaphor turns art into an act not only of production, but also of discovery. The word “excavation” has anthropological undertones, bringing to mind the image of digging through multiple layers to unearth venerable, previously-unknown treasures—refuting precisely the surface-level artistic activity and understanding for which metaphor is often criticized.
Indeed, the metaphor of excavation is a core element in Miriam’s understanding of art. “Artworks are constantly being built on top of each other, being adapted and changed,” she says. “There is a constant sense of the new appearing on top of the old, but the old is still there.” Through dance and choreography, Miriam hopes to gain insight into the influence of these older, established ideas on modern artistic innovations. She cites the newly-renovated Harvard Art Museums, whose “regal, Roman-forum walls” contrast with the modern aura provided by “clear glass and white spaces,” as an inspiration for her current conception of art as an elaborate dialogue between old and new.
While Miriam’s conception of art centers around the discovery of content, Sam sees much of art as the discovery of new forms of the same content. To him, artistic innovation is concerned not only with “increasing content depth,” but also with “changing the way we phrase and deliver the same message.” Interdisciplinary collaboration is one of the most effective facilitators of this change, as the very act of conversing with an artist from another discipline requires a brute re-contextualization of what otherwise feels innate. Sam agrees that it is both revitalizing and challenging to “express in words what you’ve always felt intuitively, what you’ve never felt the need to explain.” The end result is an interpretation of one art within the framework of another—a metaphoricalization of an artistic idea across disciplines.
In this vein, Sam is particularly excited about the idea of combining his craft of musical composition with that of dance or film. He describes a hypothetical collaboration with a choreographer in a strikingly multilayered way: “First you’d have a musician interpreting the composer’s music, then you’d have the choreographer interpreting the musician’s performance, then you’d have the dancers interpreting the choreographer’s instructions.” In this case, each “layer” represents not newly-excavated material, but rather a different expression of the same material, or a different metaphor for a common artistic vision.
In other words, metaphor is a means not only of communicating art to others, but also of creating art itself. Concrete, familiar ideas become metaphors for making art while, in the interdisciplinary collaborative process, different artistic disciplines become metaphors for each other. Only one of many reasons interdisciplinary collaboration is needed in the arts is to keep this communicative and creative power of metaphor alive.

Around 1798, Jane Austen wrote her first novel, “Northanger Abbey,” a witty parody of Gothic novels. By making the heroine an avid Gothic novel reader who imagines murder and conspiracy out of the most trivial occurrence, Austen pokes fun at the clichés and stereotypes everywhere in Gothic novels. To some extent, “Fifty Shades of Grey” resembles “Northanger Abbey” in this respect. Inspired by “Twilight,” this age’s counterpart to Gothic novels, it is full of childish lines, absurd character development, and stereotypical plots, all put in a somewhat bizarre context. All that prevents it from being a great parody is that it is not actually a parody, and the incredible stupidity of the film is not intentional.
The story starts when the undistinguished, middle-class heroine Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) meets the ridiculously handsome, young millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Sure enough, the millionaire is immediately attracted to the average girl for no apparent reason, and the two quickly begin an erotic affair—until Ana finds out that Christian is obsessed with BDSM. From this point on, the plot plunges into a horribly boring loop. First, Ana is troubled by the unusual relationship of abuse and subordination Christian asks from her. However, she cannot help being attracted to Christian due to his urbanity, appearance, and occasionally to his dominance. Finally she becomes eager to experiment in BDSM with him. After this, however, she realizes once more that she cannot handle this relationship, and everything starts over again. The loop repeats with little variation six or seven times over the course of the 125 minute movie, as if the director is enamored of the ingenious originality of this plot. The film finally ends with a foreshadowing of a sequel, leading audiences to be horribly afraid that this sequel will be made up with another seven repetitions of this loop.
It might be a little unfair to say that the plot comprises only unvaried loops, because sometimes the screenwriter does endeavor to add more elements of the depth in the characters, such as showing the hero play sad piano music in a luxurious apartment by the moonlight (another stroke of plot-writing genius) or showing the heroine standing in Christian’s private garage and asking “Which one is yours?” All these items are surpassed by the moment when Christian looks thoughtfully out of the window and sighs in a melancholy tone: “I’m fifty shades of fucked-up.”
All that said, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is actually not without merit. Above all, it has one of the most ear-catching soundtracks of the last few years, which perfectly features a remix of Beyoncé’s “Crazy in Love” in the climactic sex scene. The cinematography is delicate and often expressive. When audiences are first introduced to Christian’s “playroom,” for instance, the contrast between the darkness of the huge room and the sensually red ropes in the corner reflects both Ana’s desire and her fear. There is some chemistry between the main characters, and, surprisingly, Dakota Johnson actually acts. Her giggles, flushes, and lust seem very genuine; this genuineness, compared with the acting of Kristen Stewart in “Twilight,” is a real feat for a movie of this type.
If “Fifty Shades of Grey” were only half its current length, it might actually be a decent laugh for people who are good at entertaining themselves. Unfortunately, the film as it is right now is for the most part two hours of boredom with unbelievable characters and a repetitive, predictable plot. More painful than anything that the characters have done in this film is the thought that it is only the first movie of a trilogy.

On Friday, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly excoriated friends and family of Deah Shaddy Barakat, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha for politicizing the recent murders of the three young Muslims.
“All decent Americans [should] condemn those who use murder to advance a political agenda or seek vengeance against those with whom they disagree,” said O’Reilly. (Yusor and Razan’s father had said inaccurate media coverage of Muslims was a “triggering” factor. One of Deah’s friends had blamed Fox News and Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana by name.)
And yet O’Reilly has engaged in the same behavior he disparaged. On no less than a dozen occasions, he has used the September 2012 murders of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, to attack those with whom he disagrees. Displaying pictures of the four men killed in a terrorist attack, O’Reilly has shamed and denounced President Obama, Congressional Democrats, the “liberal media,” and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Moreover, he’s done so in explicitly political terms. When he urged Americans to “hold [Clinton] accountable,” he cited her approval rating, pivoted to her likely presidential candidacy, and decried her political resilience.
Clearly, O’Reilly has no problem politicizing the victims of murder—but that’s a good thing. The U.S. government is responsible for protecting Americans, and so every time an American is murdered, our government has failed. As such, all murders are political, and all murders must be politicized. We hold our elected officials accountable with political pressure. When we ask pointed questions, distribute blame, and bind approval ratings to the safety of citizens, we require politicians to make our safety a priority.
But O’Reilly doesn’t believe in holding our government accountable for all murders. When Muslim terrorists killed four white men under a Democratic president, he attacked relentlessly. When a self-professed opponent of “radical Islam” killed three Muslims, O’Reilly defended those who lied about the religion and exhorted the murder of its adherents. He called family and friends begging for an end to the persecution “vile” and “revolting.”
Political concern for the safety of Americans has long been segregated along racial and religious lines. After the tragic mass-shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, liberal and conservative commentators alike observed that its 26, mainly white victims ignited disproportionate political mobilization. Both President Obama and the National Rifle Association’s Wayne LaPierre offered condolences and policy solutions. 54 senators voted for a proposal to expand background checks; opponents had to launch a massive lobbying operation. Those murders continue to motivate discourse, spending, and action years later.
By contrast, hundreds of thousands have marched in the Black Lives Matter movement, but little has changed for people of color. Racism persists in public education, in our colleges, in our economy, and certainly in our criminal legal system. There have been no laws proposed, no lobbying operations jolted into high gear. The death of black teenagers has not commanded serious political change.
Every murder is a failure of the American government, but more often than not only the murders of well-off white people yield the media coverage and political action that all murders deserve.
Seven Congressional committees have investigated the Benghazi terrorist attack. Will Congress investigate the terrorism that killed Deah, Yusor, and Razan? Craig Stephen Hicks, charged with three counts of first-degree murder, hoped Muslims, Jews, and Christians would “exterminate each other.” And yet only one day after the murders, Chapel Hill’s police department and U.S. attorney said the killing was likely motivated by a parking dispute. As in the case of Benghazi, will Congress hunt through 40,000 documents and spend millions of dollars to understand their deaths and prevent similar crimes in the future? Will anyone?
It is easy to understand whose lives matter in America when politicians are held responsible for some deaths but not others. The 26 people killed at Sandy Hook deserved a national debate on gun control. The four killed in Benghazi deserve Congressional hearings and Bill O’Reilly’s outrage. But so do Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. So do Deah, Yusor, and Razan.
The U.S. government’s most important duty is to protect all American citizens. The murders of Deah Shaddy Barakat, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha—like all the 165 hate crimes perpetrated against Muslims in 2013—are failures of the American government, and we must hold our elected officials accountable. When only the murders of well-off whites produce media uproar and political mobilization, only their safety will matter to politicians in any meaningful way. If the murders of Muslims aren’t politicized—because Bill O’Reilly thinks that’s “vile,” because it might really have been about a parking dispute, or because people just don’t care—nothing will change.

General Manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is an unenviable position under the best of circumstances. Throw in seven feet of snow, subzero temperatures, and freezing winds, and the job becomes as rocky as a ride from Riverside to Park Street to Alewife.
Current GM Beverly Scott, who submitted her resignation last week, discovered the harshness of this reality over the past three weeks as record levels of snowfall derailed commuter rail and subway services and buried the MBTA in a predictable mountain of condemnation. Scott absorbed the brunt of public frustration. Critics highlighted her lack of communication with Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 and the general disarray of the system. Last Wednesday, Scott caved to the criticism and announced that she would step down from her post in April.
The scapegoating of Scott is a shame. Given the “act of God” proportions of recent weather, it is wrongheaded to punish Scott for latent deficiencies that preceded her tenure at the MBTA and exceeded her economic wherewithal.
In the eyes of some, Scott’s decision to stop subway services without consulting a Governor Baker was unforgiveable; in truth, lack of interaction with Baker is a peccadillo at worst. In recent weeks, Baker has communicated sufficiently through Massachusetts Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack, and besides, if weather conditions threaten commuter safety, then it’s the job of the GM to make a final decision.
While Scott hardly deserved the criticism she received, the basic truth is that the MBTA failed at a time when commuters most needed the benefit of public transportation. Blame must be apportioned, but it would be more appropriate to fault the system itself, rather than vilifying a GM who has been in charge of the MBTA for only two years.
The MBTA in general, and the T in particular, is an embarrassment to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The oldest subway line in the United States has long shown its age, with some Red Line cars approaching their 50th birthdays. Other lines—such as the Green Line—are outdated in design and consistently provide creaky, slow, and subpar service. Moreover, in 2010, the MBTA reportedly had $3 billion worth of backlogged repairs; today the system still labors under a multi-billion dollar debt.
As depressing as this dollar-and-cents depiction is, the woes of the MBTA concern more issues than just that of economic vitality. If Massachusetts wishes to regain its reputation for egalitarianism and environmental commitment, then the state must maintain an effective and efficient public transportation system.
A major increase in funding is the most obvious and effective way to attack these problems, which is why Governor Baker’s proposed $14 million reduction in MBTA funding should merit skepticism. Massachusetts may be facing a short-term deficit, but cutting public transportation is not a valuable solution. Improvements to the MBTA have too often been stalled by political concerns, stymied by regional desires triumphing over the best interest of the state.
It is unacceptable that in a city as advanced as Boston, severe weather can knock out public transportation for up to 30 days. Such a troubled situation requires money and legislative commitment. Let us hope that Beacon Hill can put politics aside and help the MBTA move forward more effectively than its trains.

Perhaps we have all been lied to.
In 1781, when Jeremy Bentham wrote that the principle of utility is “the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people,” he gave shape to a line of reasoning that has persisted to this day.
For many of us, the purpose of life is—explicitly or implicitly—to maximize the happiness of either ourselves, those in our immediate vicinity, or of humankind more broadly. Happiness is a big word. It did, after all, stand alongside life and liberty at the birth of a nation. We consider our goals to be noble, and indeed they are; but the question I put to you here is simple: “Why did Bentham choose happiness?” Could he find nothing else?
The first objection we must do away with is that of hedonism. When we talk about happiness, we are not talking about instantaneous, momentary happiness. It is not the happiness of the pig at the trough, or the drunk at the bar. Instead, it is medium-to-long-term happiness—the kind of contentedness that might last months, years, a lifetime. Imagine that a medical miracle made it finally possible to have infinite happiness without any negative side affects. Most of us, I think would say no to a vegetative ultra-marathon of dopamine-induced joy.
And yet the point remains. Of all the things that one might choose to maximize—wealth, sex, chocolate—why have so many great thinkers chosen something so fleeting and docile as happiness? I am of course being flippant, chocolate is just a happiness-proxy, but there are many good alternatives. Knowledge for example; ignorance is not bliss, it is an instrument for control. Is it not better to be saddened by the truth than happy-drugged by a lie? Or Freedom; one ought to at the very least have the choice of whether or not to be happy, or is indefinite happiness a fate that someone can be condemned to against their will? Or, since we have just passed Valentine’s day, why not Love; love is sporadically happy, but it is also torturous, painful, churning, and difficult.
Happiness, to me, does not seem a towering monolith of value. I am, for example, morally comfortable with the fact that Isaac Newton lived a largely miserable life, his work was far more important. It is said that Immanuel Kant lived so simple a life that he never himself set eyes upon the mountains he describes in his writing. That he missed out on such a joyous experience is not troubling though, because his happiness was not the most important thing, his work was.
It is, I think, a disservice to argue that our lives are primarily about increasing happiness. To do so relegates us to the status of happiness-maximizing-machines—incapable of deciding for ourselves what we consider to be valuable and worthwhile. The same kind of thinking also opens a dangerous trap. It allows us to believe that we are somehow entitled to happiness—that if we follow the instructions correctly we will finally arrive at some elusive destination. Or worse, that if only our lives were “happy,” then they would somehow also be complete.
I think Nietzsche said it best through his character Zarathustra: “I have long ceased to be concerned with happiness; I am concerned with my work…my happiness is heavy and not like a flowing wave of water: it presses me and will not leave me and acts like melted tar.”
To be clear, I do not advocate unhappiness as a way of life. That would be, and unfortunately in many cases is, tragedy. But an important question that we in particular should all ask ourselves is, “What does my happiness look like?” It almost certainly does not look like always-on white smile, flawless physique, perfect grades, social celebrity, championship-winning-shot. Happiness, in its true realization, is almost never what it looks like on television.
Perhaps Newton was indeed “happy”—but his happiness was not light and flowery. It did not always feel good. It was heavy, and writhing, and gnawing. I am sure it clung to him like tar as he was working through his most productive discoveries. I hope that we all find happiness. I am sure many of us already have; we just haven’t recognized it yet.

Due to the ordinary neglect one incurs over the course of a lifetime, I nurse a constant babbling in my heart. By day, when the speaker at an OCS info session stands with his back to my face, it whispers, “Why don’t you look at me?” By night, when I return to an empty bed and the memory of childhood heartbreak breaks in, it howls, “Why don’t you care?”
With such a chatter brewing for so long, I was surprised to hear a stranger’s kindness put my heart at ease. Eric was the handyman helping my mom spruce up our rental before we moved up north. During one of my visits home, he stopped by the house to give her a token of remembrance. Three wristwatches, each an artifact of his late mother’s collection, twinkled in his well-used hands as he displayed them for my mother to select a favorite. Then, seeing I was there too, Eric removed the watch most appropriate for my small limbs and gifted it to me instead.
It took several days for the extravagance of the gesture to hit me. Now, I wear my watch all the time. To him I was unknown yet somehow deemed worthy of affection. We spent hours together in the final week I lived in that house, packaging paintings, sharing stories. Despite crossing paths for only a moment, Eric and I were able to build a friendship from nothing, all thanks to the gift of a watch and, with it, the unspoken assurance: “To me, you matter.”
How many times today have I failed to make eye contact with a passing friend? How many times this week have I sat next to a stranger in the dining hall and failed to ask his name? How often have I sent an email to a fellow club member without including some sentiment intimating that I care whether she lives or dies in addition to whether she has completed her assignment?
Neglect is a sin greater than incompetence, even and especially at Harvard. When it is applied to human relationships, we don’t miss deadlines, we miss lives. People we care about but only used to know, people we have never met but could love more dearly than anyone else in this world: These are the casualties of failing to reach out to those we are not in the habit of giving our time.
By no means do I expect you to swing by Shoenhof’s on your way home to pick up a beautifully illustrated children’s book for your favorite Crimson columnist. Still, there is something to be said for the boldness of Eric’s gesture.
If you are looking to open your hearts to those currently on its periphery, consider starting with something over the top. Walk back to Pfoho for lunch with your quadded classmate. Buy your boyfriend’s roommate a new pair of snow shoes. Offer the pre-med you just met at Brain Break a companion as she charges through the rest of her all-nighter. Banish the fearful tumult of an unnurtured soul to the obscurity where it belongs. Love boldly.

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, a new ramen restaurant at 1 Bow St., has received much fanfare since opening last week despite record-setting snowfall. At times, the wait has reached two hours long, with lines stretching out the door as customers wait for a table at Harvard Square’s newest restaurant.
“There has been a lot of buzz despite the weather,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “This has been a really exciting and successful opening.”
The restaurant opened to the public on Feb. 11 in the face of blizzard conditions experienced earlier that week.
Nao White, a business consultant for Santouka, said that over 700 bowls of ramen are being served each day. In order to keep up with demand, the restaurant has made use of a new waitlist service, TapGuest, that allows customers to wait where they choose until they are summoned for their table via a text message.
“We have 59 seats and try to serve as many people as possible, so using TapGuest is helping us a lot,” White said. “We don’t want customers to waste their time waiting outside.”
The menu is currently limited to four ramen dishes and two special noodle dishes but is slated to expand in early March, according to White. White added that the restaurant has decided to limit the menu to ensure that customers are first introduced to Santouka’s most signature dishes. The full menu will feature rice bowls that are meant to be ordered in combination with a ramen dish.
In order to make the ramen using traditional Japanese methods, the staff is required to undergo lengthy training. White said the staff has been trained during the last month in preparation for the restaurant’s opening and will soon learn the new dishes for the spring menu expansion.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka is an international franchise; the new Harvard Square location is the 60th location worldwide, White said. However, the Bow St. location is only their second stand-alone restaurant in the United States.
According to White, Santouka has signed a 10-year initial lease agreement for the Bow St. location.

UPDATED: February 18, 2015, at 2:18 a.m.
Ten years after being appointed the first director of Harvard's Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, Ryan M. Travia is set to depart Harvard and take up an associate dean of students position at Babson College next month.
Travia was also the director of the Department of Health Promotion and Education, charged with overseeing divisions such as the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors.
Through his work with AODS, Travia oversaw many changes in the way the University educates students about alcohol and disciplines them for infractions. When he first came to Harvard in 2005, he said, the College’s drug policies were decentralized. In 2012, a new alcohol policy standardized enforcement of alcohol rules throughout the Houses.
In addition, Travia said that education about alcohol was not a focus among administrators.
“The notion was that if you even spoke about alcohol, you could only do it from a legal context,” Travia said in an interview Tuesday. “And so the proctors… were instructed that they had to read the verbiage of the handbook of students and they could go no further than that. There were no orientation programs on alcohol.”
Travia added that underage students found with alcohol were written up and had their names presented to the Administrative Board.
In 2007, Harvard unveiled an alcohol and drug amnesty policy, which allows students to bring themselves or intoxicated friends to Harvard University Health Services without facing the possibility of disciplinary action.
"Probably one of my proudest moments and biggest wins that I think we were able to accomplish collectively for the community was the passage of the amnesty policy back in 2007, which I really view as the central tenet to our entire approach here," Travia said.
He described several trends he had witnessed during his tenure at Harvard, including a shift away from beer and wine to hard alcohol consumption among undergraduates, which he associates with "pregaming," or drinking that goes on before a party or event.
Travia also said that despite the 2009 decriminalization of marijuana in Massachusetts, he did not see an increase in the use of the drug, which he said about 25 percent of students report having tried and between 10 and 12 percent report having used in the last month.
“Marijuana is something we will need to keep an eye on as the country moves towards legalization… Interestingly enough, despite the decriminalization, we have not seen any movement in our trend data whatsoever,” he said.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67, who has worked closely with Travia over the past 10 years on alcohol education initiatives, praised Travia’s work.
“I think we’ve made great strides in terms of how we think about the use and abuse of alcohol,” Dingman said, lauding Travia for his focus on data and surveys and his work with Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, the peer educational group concerning drugs.
Travia's last day at Harvard will be March 13, he said. He expects that the University will announce his replacement in the coming months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post reporter known for his coverage of this summer’s civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., spoke about the challenges of sociopolitical developments in Ferguson and the role of social media in journalism during a speaker series Tuesday afternoon.
The event, held by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government, was titled “Reporting on Ferguson and Subsequent Developments” and moderated by Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center.
Lowery, who was named the 2014 Emerging Journalist of the Year by the National Association of Black Journalists, moved to Ferguson last August to cover the events that unfolded in the aftermath of the death of Michael Brown. He stayed there until after the grand jury decisions in November, when Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson was acquitted of all charges following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.
“It became apparent real quickly that this was a story that was about much more than an 18-year-old being shot in the street,” Lowery said to a crowd of Kennedy School students and fellows.
Lowery discussed his experience speaking to Ferguson locals in what he called a socioeconomically and racially diverse suburb. According to him, Brown’s death was not the only instance of tension between the police force and African-American residents.
“Every person I talked to had a specific distrust for local police force,” Lowery said.
He discussed the role of social media in the coverage of Ferguson, saying that it acted as a “feedback mechanism” that empowered people in Ferguson to hold journalists accountable, as well as allowing the stories of “real people” to be heard.
“People in Ferguson, protest leaders, and activists would take to task specific news organization over specific lines of specific stories,” Lowery said.
Derwin L. Dubose, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School who attended the discussion, asked Lowery how Ferguson had managed to remain latent on racial issues for such a long period despite the extensive communication platforms available to the average citizen through social media.
Lowery claimed that the suburb had remained relatively dormant despite concerns over policing and racial instability due to black families’ conscious decision to move to the suburb in order to give their children access to better educational opportunities.
Lowery cited the controversial suspension of Dr. Art McCoy, the African American superintendent of the Ferguson-Florissant school district, by the school board in late 2013 as one of the events that helped further spark civil unrest in the wake of Michael Brown’s shooting.
During the talk, Jones asked Lowery about the legacy of Ferguson and how it had changed the media environment. Lowery said that the ultimate takeaway was the interaction between journalists and the people whose stories they aim to tell.
“You have to engage in the platforms and mediums where they are,” said Lowery, adding that it is important to “empower [people] to tell their own stories.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the closing of Boston’s largest homeless shelter on Long Island last October, local and temporary shelters are working to get displaced guests out of the winter weather.
Barbara V. Trevisan, director of communications at the Pine Street Inn shelter in Boston, said that the organization has experienced a large influx of people recently.
“With the weather and the closing of the [Long Island] shelter, we’ve definitely had an overflow of people here for many of the nights this winter,” Trevisan said. “We definitely don’t turn anyone away at this time of year.”
According to Trevisan, the shelter has run out of normal beds and at times has put down emergency cots in the lobbies and dining areas. She said that Pine Street Inn has accommodated many who had lived on Long Island.
The city has created more shelter space to address increased winter demand. In January, a new temporary shelter with a capacity of 100 people opened in a city-owned building on Southhampton St. in Boston. In early spring, the Boston Public Health Commission plans to increase the space to upward of 490 beds.
A BPHC-run temporary shelter at the former South End Fitness Center in Boston houses more displaced guests, but is capped at approximately 250 people, according to BPHC spokeswoman McKenzie Ridings.  The Long Island Shelter, which was closed after the city shut down bridge connecting it to the mainland, had a capacity of 700 people.
Many smaller shelters in the Boston area, however, have not had the capacity to assist with the overflow of people searching for a place to stay. The Somerville Homeless Coalition, for example, has only 16 beds, which are always filled.
“We didn’t see any change, and I think you’ll find that’s true for all the shelters on this side of the river,” executive director Mark Alston-Follansbee said. “We’re small and have a fixed number of beds.”
This is not the only winter Boston shelters will have to deal with the issue of displaced homeless residents. The Long Island bridge may take five years, as well as $90 million, before it is replaced.

Divest Harvard aims to launch a fossil fuel-free fund to which alumni can donate as an alternative to the University’s endowment, according to the group’s announcement from earlier this month. The coalition of students, faculty, and alumni that calls for the University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels occupied Massachusetts Hall for 24 hours last week.
The Fossil Free Alumni Fund stipulates that Harvard will only receive the donations if the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—publicly commits to divesting from fossil fuels by Dec. 31, 2025, as detailed in the press release. Otherwise, the fund will be donated to one or more nonpartisan national organizations that work to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
“[The fund] will be one more form for alumni to get across the fact that climate change really matters,” said Bill E. McKibben ’82, an environmental activist and former Crimson president. McKibben called the fund “the next big forum” for the group’s movement and said that he expects many alumni to contribute.
Over the past year, 1,000 alumni have signed the organization's petition to divest from fossil fuels, according to the press release. In addition, the Harvard-Radcliffe Club of Vermont officially backed the divest movement in December, after 76 percent of its membership supported the measure in an annual survey.
According to the press release, the group will seek $5 million in commitments before accepting donations in order to secure lower management fees. Although the fund has received pledges, Divest Harvard has not released donor names or amounts, Divest Harvard student outreach coordinator Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 said. Divest Harvard does not have a timeline for securing the $5 million in commitments, she added.
“A large number of alumni don’t want to be supporting the fossil fuel industry,” Maxmin said. “The divestment fund is an opportunity for alumni to support Harvard, and [the donations] will go to Harvard when we divest from fossil fuels.”
The tax-deductible donations will be invested in a fossil-fuel-free index developed by the Natural Resources Defense Council and managed by BlackRock, while an alumni advisory council will oversee the management of the fund, according to the press release.
Divest Harvard is not the only student-alumni organization to use a diversionary fund to solicit donations with the intent to return it on the condition that a university divests its endowment for an environmental cause. Divestment organizations at 18 schools, including Boston College, MIT, Stanford, and Tufts, joined forces to create the Multi-School Fossil Free Divestment Fund last December.
Divest Harvard decided against joining the multi-school divestment fund because it wanted to use a different investment manager, BlackRock, Maxmin said.
The University has maintained that it continues to make contributions “that ultimately will reduce human dependence on fossil fuels and usher in a more sustainable future” through research and teaching, according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 18, 2015, at 11:31 a.m.
After the impending closure of Stillman Infirmary and its 10 overnight observation beds, Harvard University Health Services will use the new space to expand patient booking resources and mental health resources by 20 to 25 percent, according to UHS Director Paul J. Barreira.
Dermatology and allergy care, which currently share the third floor with Stillman, will be relocated to the fifth floor in a construction project that Barreira said he hopes will begin this summer.
According to Barreira, architects are drafting floor plans, which the Massachusetts Department of Public Health will then have to approve before the repurposing can begin. Construction, he said, would likely last through the fall semester, adding that 24-hour urgent care will still be available under the changes.
The news that Stillman would close at the end of the academic year prompted student outcry last fall.
Barreira said Stillman’s current location is an “incredibly valuable clinical space” that is currently being used to treat about 250 students who, he said, can be treated elsewhere.
“We can treat those students safely and effectively without the observation beds,” he said, “so why wouldn't we do that so that we can then use the space to maximize medical and counseling mental health services for a greater number of students.”
To maintain the kind of treatment currently offered by Stillman, UHS administrators are in the stages of producing protocol for the treatment of three prospective after-hours patient groups, including students who are seeking services for intoxication, mental health concerns, and medical or orthopedic issues.
Though reclining chairs and gurneys will likely replace the overnight beds previously used by students in these three groups, Barreira said the processes of receiving care will generally remain unchanged. Those chairs and gurneys will be located on UHS’s third floor, he said.
Patient group procedures are simultaneously being reviewed and assessed by working groups assembled by Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. One group composed of UHS staff, House masters, deans, tutors, and students will be meeting regularly, while two smaller groups with tutors and students are scheduled to convene as well.
“We have to have people who have a stake in their part of the issues to articulate all the parts of problem from their perspective,” Lassonde said.
The groups were first given a new protocol for treating intoxicated students and are currently discussing the details of how it will be implemented. As the procedures for each group are addressed and approved by both the working groups and UHS, Barreira said he hopes to implement a rolling closure of the current care structure and begin implementing the new protocols.
According to Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, the UC is supportive of the plan to improve access to urgent care and increase mental health resources, provided that the changes do not detract from existing services.
“We do not want to see the quality of treatment practices compromised with this reappropriation of resources at UHS,” Nasrollahzadeh said.

As Harvard Law School moves to depart from Harvard’s newly centralized procedures for investigating cases of alleged sexual misconduct, a group of Law professors continue to criticize the University-wide policy that defines sexual harassment, claiming that it offers lackluster protections of academic freedom.
The University’s central policy, which applies to all of Harvard’s schools and took effect last year, defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” including “verbal, nonverbal, graphic, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
The policy includes a stipulation that it will not “be construed to abridge academic freedom and inquiry, principles of free speech, or the University’s educational mission.” But some professors at the Law School, many of whom have previously vocally criticized the policy, say that it is not enough.
According to some Law School professors critical of the policy, the verbal definition of sexual harassment could endanger academic inquiry on topics of human sexuality, like rape law, as they claim Harvard’s policy does not also provide adequate protections of academic freedom.
Calling the policy’s statement on academic freedom “unhelpful,” Janet E. Halley, a Law School professor, argued that “speech [in an academic context] can be a form of sexual conduct under the policy, and if it’s unwanted, speech acts could become the basis for charges of sexual harassment.”
Professors, including Halley, aired criticism of the policy’s protection of academic freedom last fall both in an open letter to the Boston Globe and in an internal memo, circulated among the Law School’s faculty, that recommended changes to Harvard’s approach to handling cases of sexual harassment.
The internal memo, dated November, requested that the Law School protect academic freedom as did its former sexual harassment policy, passed in 1995. The old Law School policy featured more than one example delineating proper and improper conduct and academic freedoms.
“Any new policy must contain at a minimum the free speech protection incorporated in the 1995 HLS [Sexual Harassment] Policy through interpretive guidance and illustrations,” 20 professors wrote in the November memo. All 20 professors who signed the memo were also signatories of the October open letter in the Globe.
One signatory, Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk, authored an essay in the New Yorker this past winter on the topic of teaching rape law and advocated for teaching the subject at a recent Law School event. In an interview, Suk argued that Harvard’s policy does not offer enough explicit protection for teaching rape law.
The University’s policy could “drastically limit what students and professor can say about issues that I think they should be free to talk to about,” said Elizabeth Bartholet, a Law School professor who signed the memo and open letter.
For her part, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides defended the policy’s protections of academic freedom. She wrote in an email that “academic freedom is one of Harvard’s most fundamental values” and that under the policy, students and professors may discuss “sexually provocative or offensive material” when it is relevant to academic discussion.
Law School faculty members continue to criticize Harvard’s sexual harassment policy even as the Law School plans to implement new school-specific investigation procedures that differ significantly from the University’s central framework. In December, the Law School adopted a set of sexual harassment procedures that bypasses the University’s central investigation office so that the school may conduct investigations in-house. They will be implemented “as soon as possible,” according to Law School spokesperson Robb London.

Alex Biega ’10 scored the winning goal and earned the first star of the game in his National Hockey League debut on Monday night.
The 26-year-old defenseman for the Vancouver Canucks became the 26th Harvard hockey alum to play in the NHL after learning hours before the Canucks’ home contest with the Minnesota Wild that he would make his first career start. Biega, who had played 313 games with three different teams in the American Hockey League following his graduation in 2010, made the most of the opportunity.
With less than nine minutes left in regulation and the Canucks leading, 2-1, Biega collected a stray centering feed from all-star teammate Henrik Sedin off the right boards and beat Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk through a screen with a blistering slap-shot.
Vancouver would go on to win, 3-2, and Biega’s even strength marker turned out to be the difference.
At Harvard, Biega served as the Crimson’s 116th captain in his senior season. The Montreal native led all Crimson defensemen in scoring in his sophomore year and was named to the ECAC All-Tournament team in 2008. Harvard honored Biega as the team’s most valuable player after each of his last two collegiate seasons.
Three other former Harvard players are currently playing for NHL teams: Alex Killorn ’12 (Tampa Bay Lightning), Dominic Moore ’03 (New York Rangers), and Craig Adams ’99 (Pittsburgh Penguins).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The frigid air and heavy snow kept many inside on Saturday, but the weekend storm was no match for the ice running through the veins of sophomore track athlete Nikki Okwelogu.
The second-year standout broke her own Ivy League record in the shot put en route to a first-place finish at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet. The record-breaking throw traveled 16.51 meters and helped the Crimson squad to a second-place finish overall.
The sophomore defeated runner-up Karleh Wilson of Yale by nearly two full meters. In fact, all of her six attempts in the event were better than the Bulldog by at least .78 meters.
Okwelogu is familiar with breaking records in the event. She first set the Ivy League mark the previous weekend with a 16.39 meter mark at the Crimson Elite Meet, besting the previous record by .08 meters. The sophomore is also the Harvard record holder in the outdoor shot put, claiming the top spot with a throw of 16.05 meters.
For Okwelogu, performances like this have been the norm rather than the exception, as she has still yet to be beaten by another collegiate athlete in the shot put event all season. In her mind, preparation makes all the difference in the world.
“I’m definitely working way harder than I did last year,” Okwelogu said. “I’m excited to see all the hard work I did this season and pre-season paying off.”
As the outdoor season approaches, Okwelogu also plans to compete in the discus event in addition to the shot put. The sophomore holds the Ivy League record in the discus after throwing a 53.31 meter toss at the Nigerian National Championships this past summer.
Although her future is certainly bright, Okwelogu still has the rest of this season to keep striving. The Crimson athlete hopes to help the women’s team defend its Ivy League Heptagonal Indoor title by taking home the victory in the shot put.
After just missing out on a trip to NCAA Nationals her rookie campaign, the sophomore hopes to establish herself as one of the top athletes in the nation and book a trip to Fayetteville, Ark.
“They take 16 to Nationals and right now I’m ranked 14th [or] 15th,” Okwelogu said. “I’m very close to that, and hopefully I can get another mark that will… make sure I can go because I think that will be a great meet to be a part of.”
Okwelogu’s success is not just limited to the collegiate level, as the sophomore has gained experience on the international scene as well.
The Fresno, Calif., native was a member of the Nigerian track team prior to her arrival at Harvard and was ranked in the top five in the U.S. in both shot put and discus her senior year of high school.
This past summer, Okwelogu established herself on the Nigerian team by winning the Nigerian National Championships in the shot put and receiving runner-up accolades in the same event at the African Championships.
The second-year athlete was also a finalist at the World Junior Championships and a participant at the prestigious Commonwealth Games, a competition consisting mostly of former British territories.
Moving forward, Okwelogu is focused on doing the little things to make sure her game is as strong as possible prior to playoff competition.
“Everyday I come to practice trying to fix my technique,” Okwelogu said. “I’ve held myself more accountable by doing core on the side or eating better, showing up to practice 30 minutes early and getting a good warm-up in.”
The determination and success of the sophomore has impressed those around her, as she continues to improve meet after meet.
Head coach Jason Saretsky has been very impressed with Okwelogu’s consistency and is excited about what her youth means for the future.
“One of the best parts with Nikki specifically [is that] she’s only a sophomore,” Saretsky said. “I think that we’re still only scratching the surface, and there’s a lot more still to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Neither chicken soup nor hot cocoa can cure cold-related illnesses the way a few tickets to see the Harvard hockey team play at Bright Arena can.”
Believe me, this quote didn’t come from my tape recordings.
Rather, this was a statement made by former Crimson writer Tracy Kramer ’92 at the end of a piece she published in March 1989—a time when Harvard hockey had a spot in the national spotlight. A time when hundreds of students lined up in the cold for tickets because they knew their school was on the verge of something special.
These dedicated students came to be known as the “Harvard Hares,” notorious for wreaking havoc on Crimson opponents, regardless of whether their services were required halfway across the country or right in their own backyard. Just a year ago, my fellow co-writer Michael Ledecky read Kramer’s piece and scoffed at the idea of such a crowd still existing today.
But that was then. This is now, right? Ledecky’s analysis came on the heels of a dismal 2013-2014 campaign for Harvard that concluded with Yale sweeping the Crimson off the ice in the opening round of the ECAC tournament. This year, Harvard has caught college hockey by surprise, at one point climbing as high as fourth in the national polls and first in the Pairwise rankings, which predict the NCAA tournament seedings.
Yet, I continue to scoff.
In a season that has had it all—an eight-game winning streak, three wins over top-10 teams, a double-overtime Beanpot thriller, a legitimate Hobey Baker candidate in junior forward Jimmy Vesey, a revitalized presence in the crease in junior Steve Michalek—there has only been one thing missing: the fans.
Maybe I dwell on their absence because I grew up on college hockey. Captivated by Boston College athletics as a kid growing up in Massachusetts, I idolized the “SuperFans” at Conte Forum. Additionally, having an older cousin who attended Northeastern granted me access to the Doghouse at Matthews Arena, one of the most passionate student sections I have ever seen live in action.
Consequently, I have always bought into that Bostonian mantra that there is nothing quite like the first two Mondays in February.
“But what’s a Beanpot?”
Now that’s a quote I can take credit for transcribing. This is not 1989 anymore. Sadly, the above statement provides a more accurate representation of the current Harvard hockey scene than does the testimony of Ms. Kramer. When I covered the Crimson’s first-round classic against Boston University two weeks ago, the majority of roars from the crowd following Harvard goals came from BC and Northeastern fans who had made it to their seats early. As for the Crimson student section? See the above quote.
With 21 points on the year, Harvard currently sits fourth in the ECAC, needing to stay right where it is in order to claim a first-round bye in the conference tournament. However, to do that, No. 14/13 Harvard will have to fend off five teams in nine days. The last time the Crimson played that much hockey in such a short time interval, the team lost four straight.
As those defeats began to pile up, Harvard watched its stock fall from a national title contender to a team on the bubble of making the NCAA tournament. If the city had not been doused by nearly two feet of snow over that weekend, the Crimson would have had to face BC two days after suffering its fourth straight loss. It could’ve been even worse.
But the cold never bothered Harvard anyway. With “Frozen on Ice” occupying TD Garden for nearly two weeks, the Beanpot organizers had no choice but to postpone the second round of the tournament to Feb. 23. Finally able to catch its breath, the Crimson responded by picking up three points over the weekend, getting back on track as it looks to earn a bye in the first round and home ice advantage in the second.
But does home-ice really mean advantage? Just last Saturday, Cornell packed more fans into the Bright-Landry Hockey Center than the Crimson did. And in Harvard’s last home playoff game back in 2012, against Yale no less, 801 people showed up—less than a third of the arena’s capacity.
Right now, if you enter “Harvard Hares Hockey” into a Google search engine, you are not going to find any results depicting screaming Crimson fans. Instead, you’ll get the following: “Did You Mean: Harvard Hates Hockey?”
Admittedly, I laughed upon reading this, but I know it’s not true. Harvard hockey has one of the most passionate alumni bases in the nation. However, it is time for the student population to catch up. It is time for the Hares to return.
