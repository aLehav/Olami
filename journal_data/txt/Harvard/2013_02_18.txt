After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Socrates is usually described as having been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens. Plato suggests that the charge accuses Socrates of political heresy: By publicly rejecting the Homeric gods, Socrates placed himself outside of the community. As an atheist, or so his accusers alleged, he had failed as a citizen.
Socrates, of course, was not an atheist at all (a point which he made repeatedly, labeling atheism an unjust crime), nor were the Christians who were called atheists and persecuted by Roman emperors for rejecting the state religion. Atheism, in its most technical sense, is the rejection of a god or gods, but the word carries a historical insult: An atheist is someone who has rejected civil society.
Our pluralistic democracy has its intellectual roots in the writings of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke, but even his “Letter Concerning Toleration” explicitly exempts atheists from those worthy of civic participation. “Promises, covenants, and oaths”—the good faith that binds together civil society—“can have no hold on an atheist.” That notion stayed in the social contract and crossed the Atlantic: Even today, seven state constitutions technically forbid atheists from holding public office. And though the numbers have been steadily improving, recent polls suggest that 53 percent of Americans would not vote for a well-qualified atheist and that 39.6 percent of Americans believe that atheists do not agree at all with their “vision of American society.”
Civil society depends on upholding certain moral norms, and for that reason our religious and political identities rightfully seem so entwined. But to some, a lack of faith is more than just a lack of faith. It is a lack of good faith.
We all know that this is false: Atheists are artists, philanthropists, scientists, teachers, and public servants. The command to love your neighbor needs no divine imprimatur. Yet many of us who live without religion remain reluctant to identify as what we are. Atheism is too “extreme” or “confrontational,” as we’ve heard from students at club fairs or introductory meetings. Our generation is the least religious that this country has seen, with 26 percent of young American adults identifying with no religion. But only three percent of us will take the extra step to identify as atheists.
For some, this is for principled, philosophical reasons: Some of us are agnostic, and some even hold religious beliefs but feel estranged from the institutions identified with them. Yet there remains a gap, a group of young people whose worldview does not include a deity but whose discomfort with the notion of atheism keeps them silent.
This doesn’t make much sense. As long as atheists abdicate from defining ourselves, we will be defined by those who see absence from the religious community as absence from our political and social communities. No belief system has a monopoly on reason, dialogue, and concern for the public good. These values drove Martin Luther King, Jr. as much as they drove A. Philip Randolph, an atheist and key organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, or W.E.B. Du Bois, a skeptic and freethinker whose writings helped frame the civil rights movement. Fifty years after the march, 50 years after Du Bois’ death, our generation can be even more open about our identities as we fight for broader definitions of justice and equality. Those of us who have been given the opportunity to confront those challenges must do so without fear that our lack of religious commitment will undermine our shared values.
Our generation is not only the most secular in this country’s history, but it is also the most diverse, and the variety and intersectionality of our individual identities is central to who we are as a collective. If we are to forge a community out of these various parts, we must learn to embrace and engage with our differences, to determine which disagreements matter and which ones make us stronger. The first step, though, is to recognize this, and for those whose identities are in the minority to confidently make our voices heard.
This is why the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics is holding Atheist Coming Out Week, a chance for our campus’s atheists to say who we are and why our beliefs matter. We want to prove something you already know: that atheists can coexist with the religious in a pluralistic society and that our commitment to reason, science, creativity, and compassion is essential to solving the world’s ills.
Here’s the moral of the story: If you happen not to believe in a god, say so. And while you’re at it, join us for a discussion on Why Atheism Matters with Steven Pinker ’79, Rebecca N. Goldstein, Andrew Jewett, and Greg M. Epstein today in Lamont Library. Celebrate atheist and humanist Eddie Izzard’s lifetime achievements with us in Memorial Church this Wednesday. And watch a movie with us in the SOCH Community Hall on Friday. We all thrive when we can share our identities without fear. We are atheists. We are proud. Come out with us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were a series of indelible images from the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 69-57 win over Princeton on Saturday. It was freshman point guard Siyani Chambers diving on the floor to rescue a loose ball, skidding so fast across the hardwood he nearly ran into the scorer’s table. It was Laurent Rivard pivoting and shooting, all in one motion, to drain a three right before the half to stretch a one-point lead to a four-point advantage. It was sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith swatting two of Tiger senior forward Ian Hummer’s shots into the second row. It was sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi slamming home a last-second dunk to cap off the night.
The Crimson plays its best against the best competition. Against likely tournament competition Saint Mary’s, only a late pair of free throws held back Harvard from coming up with a last-second win in a hostile road environment. Against Boston College and Cal, the Crimson won by 16 and five, respectively, on the road against Big Six programs. Until Chambers fouled out against current No. 22 Memphis, Harvard was tied 50-50 with Josh Pastner’s talented squad. Saturday against Princeton was no different.
Even with sophomore wing Wesley Saunders submitting a poor shooting effort and combining with Chambers to go six-of-23 from the floor, the team’s balanced attack netted a win. Five players scored in double digits, and a sixth—co-captain and forward Christian Webster—came up with two clutch threes at crucial moments. But the team’s overall balanced performance was not the story of the weekend.
Smith, with 16 blocks, 16 rebounds, and 34 points in two games, submitted the 24 hours of his life in spectacular efforts against Penn and the Tigers. Starting against the Quakers for the first time in 12 games, Smith was a Ricky Davis—throwing the ball off the backboard to get yourself that last rebound—away from a triple-double on Friday night. Despite being sidelined with early foul trouble against Princeton, Smith didn’t miss a shot on the night, making all nine—four from the free throw line—that he took.
When Crimson coach Tommy Amaker plays Smith and Moundou-Missi together, as he did for long stretches against the Tigers, Harvard brings a different look.
Moundou-Missi showed off his range with two jumpers from just inside the three-point line Saturday and can provide the spacing the Crimson loses by subbing out Webster or junior co-captain Laurent Rivard. Inside, Smith has been the model of efficiency for Harvard. He missed just two shots on 20 total attempts—field goals and free throws—over the weekend and has shot fifty percent or better in all but three Crimson games. His jump hook, possibly his only yet devastatingly effective inside move, is a thing of beauty.
Smith has given Harvard three forward-centers to play at the five, and the increased flexibility has allowed Amaker more lineup possibilities. Sophomore forward Jonah Travis, who has started 14 games for the Crimson this year, came off the bench for the second game in a row Saturday and gives the team seven starter-quality players in the rotation. Smith’s shot blocking ability also gives the team what it needed most—interior defense.
Much like what Saunders can do on the perimeter, Smith boasts long arms that he can use to reach balls that Travis and Moundou-Missi cannot.
In addition to his long reach, the sophomore rarely fouls—he has hit three fouls only twice this season and accumulated four fouls in 51 minutes this weekend—and provides a deterrent for guards trying to penetrate the heart of the team’s defense. This allows Saunders and Chambers to be more aggressive on the defensive end and close out on shooters, knowing that they have backup. This showed against Princeton, the best three-point shooting team in the Ivy League. The Tigers shot one-for-six against Harvard when Smith manned the middle in the second half.
The Crimson submitted easily its best two performances of the Ivy League season against Penn and Princeton, and Smith was the biggest reason why. For the team to realize its preseason goals, it likely will need to win out to take home the Ancient Eight title. With Smith swatting shots on the interior, and with the Tigers now a game-and-a-half back of Harvard with five of its next seven on the road, the chances of that look as good as they ever have.

CORRECTION: Feb. 20, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the margin by which the Harvard men's basketball team beat Boston College in their latest contest on Dec. 4, 2012. In fact, Harvard won by a margin of victory of 16 points, 79-63, not by a margin of 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The battle between the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team and No. 5 Cornell was a classic heavyweight bout. Friday night at the Lynah Rink, the two teams dueled for ECAC supremacy in a physical game marked by 14 penalties, including four roughing calls.
“There were times where we had them on the ropes and they had us on the ropes,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said.
Ultimately, it was speed, not strength, that helped Cornell protect its home ice with a 3-1 win.
Eight minutes into the third period, the Big Red’s Jessica Campbell broke a 1-1 tie after winning the puck at center-ice. The junior blew by Harvard’s defense on the side wall and carved back towards the goal. Gliding across the crease, Campbell enticed freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer to slide across with the shooter before Campbell deposited the puck on the shortside.
Six minutes later, Campbell gave Cornell a security goal in similar fashion. During a penalty kill, the forward won possession of the puck in the neutral zone and used her speed to create a breakaway opportunity. This time, Campbell fired a shot by Maschmeyer on the far side.
“We played them pretty tough and they got a couple of extra bounces and were able to capitalize,” Co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “Sometimes plays like that where they were able to capitalize, they were able to get around us.”
With the victory, Cornell (21-5-1, 16-3-1 ECAC) retained its ECAC point lead, though Harvard (19-4-2, 15-2-1) still controls its own destiny with four games to play.
Campbell’s second marker was a low point for the Crimson power play unit, which was 0-for-6 with a man advantage.
“We tried to find the seams and we had some looks at the net but we need to move the puck,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Cornell, one of the reasons their penalty kill is good is that they block a lot of shots, and so [there are] things to learn and we hope the next time we get the opportunity to play them we’ll make some pretty good adjustments.”
The Crimson’s power-kill was just as effective as the Big Red’s, as Cornell went goalless on four power-play chances. The two defenses were strong against even-strength attacks as well, surrendering few good looks to opposing shooters.
The Big Red’s first goal came when a shot from the top of the circle caromed off the leg of a Harvard defender. The puck got past Maschmeyer just after senior Kaitlin Spurling finished serving a two-minute cross-checking penalty.
The Crimson responded in the second period with a goal of its own. Eight minutes into the period, sophomore Samantha Reber dropped a pass to classmate Hillary Crowe, who wove into the slot and flicked a shot past Cornell’s goalie. Crowe’s goal was her second in as many games after going goalless for two months. Reber is also on a hot streak; including Saturday’s game against Colgate, the sophomore has tallied six points in three games, twice as many as she had in the previous month.
Following Crowe’s goal, the two teams went twenty minutes without a goal before Campbell finally broke the tie. During that time, the two squads showed signs of increasing frustration, combining for seven penalties, including calls for roughing, boarding, hooking, and slashing. Several other controversial open-ice collisions were met with play-on calls from the referees.
“That’s the kind of team they are; they try to intimidate you with their size,” Stone said. “We handled that well but I think we can play more physically under control as well.”
Harvard was unable to respond to Campbell’s two-goal third period. It took a number of shots late but many flew wide or were blocked as Cornell’s goalie was forced to make stops on only six of 23 shots.
“I think Cornell is a good team and they showed up ready to go and they had a bit of an edge over us and we just couldn’t find the back of the net,” Dempsey said. “We weren’t getting to the goalie’s face enough; we weren’t putting shots on net. We weren’t really challenging her.”
After the scoreless third, the Crimson left the ice with just one goal for the fourth time in seven games. Prior to that stretch, Harvard had scored at least twice in 14 straight games and had been held to one goal only once in its first 19 games.
“You can’t overanalyze it,” Stone said. “That’s the way it typically should be against real good goaltending. It is what it is, so I’m not concerned about it.”

From Richard Nixon's "I am not a crook"-ery to Bill Clinton's blue dress shenanigans, years of presidential transgressions have proven that nothing is sacred and the White House is anything but. Which is why we don't have too many qualms in using this Presidents' Day to shamelessly objectify our Commanders-in-Chief and consider which of the 44 we would most like to hit up on Tinder.

IT'S A MATCH!
George Washington
 
You never forget your first (president).
 
Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880
 
While at Harvard, TR was popularly known as a "locomotive in human pants." Later, he was a Rough Rider who carried a big stick. You can draw your own conclusions.
John F. Kennedy '40
Arguably the biggest cutie the Oval Office has ever seen. We don't blame you for wanting to spend a little QT in the Executive Residence with this guy.
