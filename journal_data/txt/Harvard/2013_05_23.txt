After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Fifty-eight professors from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences requested in a letter Thursday to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith that he appoint a faculty committee to draft “ethical and educational principles” that would provide a framework for FAS engagement with HarvardX, the University’s curricular contributions to edX.
The letter, shared with The Crimson by one of its signatories, asks that those principles be brought to a faculty vote in the 2013-2014 academic year.
“It is our responsibility to ensure that HarvardX is consistent with our commitment to our students on campus, and with our academic mission,” the letter reads. “Given the rapid pace of development of HarvardX, we believe it is essential to have a formal, sustained, and structured faculty discussion on these issues as soon as possible.”
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that Smith is committed to working with faculty members interested in developing HarvardX courses, but he also wants to assure faculty members that they will remain free to choose how they structure the courses they teach.
“Dean Smith looks forward to continuing the ongoing dialogue with these and other members of the FAS faculty,” Neal wrote. “Free inquiry and spirited debate is at the heart of any university’s mission.”
The call for greater faculty oversight at Harvard comes amidst a period a rapid expansion for edX, the online educational platform founded through joint $30 million investments by Harvard and MIT last May. On Tuesday, edX announced 15 new member-schools across the globe, more than doubling its size and bringing its total membership to 27 institutions.
The letter stated that one year after the launch of the rapidly expanding venture, “some faculty are tremendously excited about the potential of HarvardX; others are deeply concerned about the program’s costs and consequences.”
The faculty first extensively discussed HarvardX as a body at its monthly meeting last December, and a number of professors have voiced concern about the project in recent months. Most recently, at the May faculty meeting, a number of professors have questioned what they described as Harvard’s rapid advance into online education. That debate, which was part of a larger conversation about the faculty’s relationship with administrators, centered around what several professors called a lack of meaningful consultation on the development of HarvardX.
“We appreciate the meetings, town halls, and other arenas in which faculty have been able to discuss HarvardX. But we believe that many critical questions about the relationship of the FAS to HarvardX, and to edX, have not yet been addressed,” the letter reads.
Signed by former deans, members of the Faculty Council, and several University professors, the letter was also sent to University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel is leaving the Crimson for an assistant coaching position at Vanderbilt.
According to The Tennessean's Jeff Lockridge, Hufnagel accepted the Vanderbilt position over an opportunity at Memphis.
As an assistant to Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker over the past four seasons, Hufnagel served as the point man for the Crimson’s recruiting efforts. Since his arrival in Cambridge, Harvard has consistently boasted recruiting classes among the Ancient Eight’s best.
"While we are certainly sad to lose Yanni here at Harvard, we are thrilled for him and this tremendous opportunity with Coach Stallings at Vanderbilt," Amaker wrote in a statement. "We are incredibly grateful for Yanni's contribution to the success we've been able to achieve during his tenure here, and we know that Yanni's  enthusiasm and energy will be incredible assets for Vanderbilt Basketball, as they have been here for us."
Last March, Hufnagel helped Harvard secure the commitment of Zena Edosomwan ’17—the Ivy League’s first ever commitment from a Scout.com Top-100 recruit.
Hufnagel’s success has garnered national attention. Last October, CBSSports.com’s Matt Norlander picked Hufnagel as one of three assistant coaches for his 2012-13 college basketball dream team.
Since Hufnagel’s arrival in Cambridge, the Crimson has won three Ivy League titles and earned its first NCAA tournament victory.
Vanderbilt is coming off a 16-17 season in which it finished in the bottom half of the SEC.
Under head coach Kevin Stallings, the Commodores have reached the NCAA tournament six times since 2004. Vanderbilt’s most recent tournament victory came in 2012 when the fifth-seeded Commodores topped Harvard, 79-70.
The squads have also gone head-to-head on the recruiting trail in past years.
In 2009, forward Rod Odom ultimately settled on Vanderbilt after being heavily recruited by the Crimson. And in 2010, center Kenyatta Smith ’15 picked Harvard over an offer from Vanderbilt.
Hufnagel joined the Crimson coaching staff back in 2009 after spending two seasons as a graduate assistant at the University of Oklahoma.
Hufnagel marks the second assistant coach to leave the Harvard men’s basketball program this offseason. Brian Adams, who joined the Crimson prior to the 2011-12 season, recently accepted an assistant coaching position at Marist.
