After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week the Supreme Court reconvened for another landmark session likely to set new precedents with striking impacts on American society for years to come — and Harvard finds itself right in the center of one of the most controversial cases on the docket.
Students for Fair Admission is suing Harvard, alleging their race-conscious admissions have led the school to discriminate against Asian Americans in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. SFFA, an organization that represents thousands of students who claim to be victims of discriminatory admissions policies, is asking the nation’s highest court to overturn Grutter v. Bollinger, the 2003 decision that allowed the University of Michigan’s law school to consider race in admissions decisions to promote diversity.
Defendants of affirmative action argue that considering race is essential to reverse centuries of oppression imposed on Black people, the lasting impacts of which contribute to obstacles in the admissions process for people of color. The policy’s critics lambast the crude use of skin color when deciding who gains entry to elite colleges, and bemoan the injustice faced by Asian Americans today.
Focusing the discussion on race allows both sides to tell compelling narratives about racism, yet this reductionist approach misses an important issue: the socioeconomic makeup of Harvard’s students.
Poor individuals are significantly underrepresented in Harvard’s student body — discussions about race and admissions ignore this important issue. According to U.S. Census Bureau population surveys, about 29 percent of American households earn less than $40,000 and 55 percent earn less than $80,000, compared to an estimated 13.9 and 26 percent of the Class of 2025 with income in these brackets, respectively.
The discrepancy is striking.
And despite a full-throated embrace of affirmative action in the courts, Harvard has not ensured socioeconomic diversity in its student population.
Creating a diverse socioeconomic student body and creating a racially diverse student body are not mutually exclusive pursuits, and the University should attend to both goals in tandem. Yet the current policy that focuses exclusively on race is unfair to poor students of all ethnicities.
Proponents of affirmative action maintain that it fosters diversity — a claim that Harvard itself has advanced in legal arguments in the SFFA case. It is also designed as a reparational correction to compensate for the challenges Black students face due to the long shadow of a racist history. But why not apply these arguments to poor applicants?
In a Government section discussing the importance of social welfare, or an English lecture analyzing the portrayal of poor people in a novel, or in an Economics class about the tradeoffs between government welfare spending and economic efficiency, the perspective of a student who lives below the poverty line — or even a student whose family’s income is in the bottom quintile — would only strengthen Harvard’s mission of educating students of all backgrounds. Yet Harvard’s current demographics ensure these conversations are largely dominated by privileged individuals from well-off families. While these students undoubtedly have valuable insights to share, the beliefs of a large portion of America are missing from these discussions.
Poor students are also highly disadvantaged in the college application process. Research suggests that financially disadvantaged upbringings are predictive of low SAT scores —  more so than racial background. In a nation with low levels of social mobility in comparison to other OECD countries, this phenomenon should not be surprising, but Harvard’s inability to compensate for the challenges poor students face is damning, especially given its commitment to equity.
Admitting a representative amount of underprivileged students is fairer than the current system, which hurts low-income applicants, presuming poor students are no less meritorious on average than their richer counterparts. A fairer admissions process would also enrich conversation on Harvard’s campus by adding new perspectives. Ensuring proportional representation of students across economic classes generally would make Harvard look more like America.
Harvard’s “need-blind” admissions policy, which ostensibly acts to protect poor individuals from discrimination by the admissions office, should be replaced with a policy that allows the admissions office to learn about applicants’ socioeconomic backgrounds and judge them relative to the resources available to them. The current system, although “need-blind,” de facto punishes poorer applicants by holding them to the same academic and extracurricular standards as richer students. Instead, Harvard should adopt an equitable approach that asks students about their family’s income and judges students by metrics tailored to their household earnings, ensuring more even representation across economic classes.
With Harvard in the news and affirmative action on the chopping block, it makes sense why discussions about admissions are focused on race. But we should not forget that Harvard’s current admissions process falls short of providing diversity in college and equity during the admissions process. Regardless of the SFFA case outcome, we can call upon Harvard to admit more low-income students.
The Supreme Court has an important issue to decide, but so does Harvard too.

Tower of London. The Year of Our Lord, Two Thousand Fourteen. A fairly robust little Indian boy is sitting on a battlement, eyeing a murder of crows descend on a fish and chips cart, planning one of the greatest heists in history.
Of course, it wasn’t successful. If it had been, the aforementioned well-fortified Indian child — me — would be writing this op-ed from inside jail, eating the King’s prison porridge.
“Those bloody British.”
A key phrase, hard-coded into any good Desi’s frontal lobe. And for good reason — the Brits looted, conquered, and subjugated India for over 300 years. By the time they left, they had laid the foundation for what quickly became one of the world’s most dangerous, violent rivalries.
But put an Indian and a Pakistani in one room, and they will agree on one thing: F--- those bloody British.
So when my parents and I were staring at one of the largest diamonds in the world, the Kohinoor, studded safely in the Crown of the Queen Mother, I was not told about its history, its curse, its veneer, or its honor. I was told one thing.
“They stole that from us, you know?”
After the recent death of Queen Elizabeth II, there has been a groundswell of online support in India for returning the diamond, even landing #Kohinoor on the trending topics list on Indian Twitter.
The diamond is purported to have first been unearthed in the mines of Kollur in present-day Andhra Pradesh, after which it was passed from kingdom to kingdom, from the Delhi Sultanate to the Mughals, until it finally ended up in the hands of the Singh Maharajas of the Sikh Empire. It was Maharaja Duleep Singh Bahadur that finally handed over the Kohinoor to Queen Victoria, though he had little choice in the matter: The diamond was a cherry on the top of the 1849 Treaty of Lahore, which ended the Second Anglo-Sikh War and annexed Punjab to British Company rule.
The diamond was carted from British India to London, where it was extolled by the Marquess of Dalhousie, the man who had secured its provision by treaty. The British population, though, were rather unimpressed by the lumpy gem — this was not the “Mountain of Light” that had been advertised to them.
So Prince Albert cut the diamond in half just to shine it.
There’s a peculiar sort of parallel in that. Just like the Kohinoor was cut in half, colonial India was cleaved into the modern state of India and Pakistan — two nations and more than a billion people birthed into nearly a century of conflict. In many ways, Britain’s refusal to repatriate the Kohinoor feels like a hard, crystalline symbol of its unwillingness to let the sun set on the British Empire, to let go of the gem of their empire, to acknowledge their role in tearing apart a subcontinent.
Repatriation is a hot topic internationally. Former imperialist nations like France and Germany have pledged to return indigenous items taken by conquest, and university museums like Cambridge have promised the same.
Across the pond, in our very own Cambridge, Harvard has promised to return human remains housed in our museums, and a further push is being made to investigate how the University acquired these remains and many other such items. And yes, the guidelines are rather vague and left to the University’s discretion, but in general, repatriation seems to be on the rise.
In this respect, the United Kingdom stands as a bastion of stiff-upper-lipped, Earl-Grey-flavored resistance.
While some repatriations have been granted in the past, the British Museum Act of 1963 outright prohibits the deaccession of any artifact, barring special circumstances.
This is not likely to change soon. It seems that the ex-largest empire in the world is loath to acknowledge that its previous colonies have risen in the world stage, preferring to hold on to the policy of “finders keepers, losers weepers.”
So, my dear Brits, I now speak directly to you.
Hi mates. I hope you’re doing well.
First of all, R.I.P. Elizabeth. She may have contributed to colonization and spent decades as imperialism’s kindliest face, but as a person, she was formidable and generally loved.
That said, listen, we’re gonna need the diamond back. You lot barely even use it. And yes, this may not necessarily change in an Indian museum, but here’s the difference: For us, it’s a beacon of our cultural heritage, a jewel that represents the journey of a billion people’s ancestors through history, a special representation of the country; for y’all, it’s just another big, ill-gotten diamond.
Also, get with the program. Institutions all over the world are returning things to their homelands. You have a rich cultural history of your own to display that spans about 1500 years of everything Game of Thrones is based off of.
And, what do you even need the diamond for? Let me tell you, the real diamonds in your arsenal are the Great British Bake Off, Gordon Ramsey, and that one contestant on Love Island who thought Liverpool was a country. You can show them off.
As for our heritage, I found it eight years ago in a glass case, shimmering with the beauty of my homeland. When I visit that homeland, I should like to see it there, to gaze into its 66 facets and see my ancestors staring back.
And your dying empire should well know from its heyday:
Finders keepers. Losers weepers.
Love,
Anant Rajan, 13th Earl of Marietta, Ga.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past five years, the Harvard Management Company under the leadership of N.P. “Narv” Narveker has continually reported positive returns on Harvard’s endowment. This year, however, things may not be as smooth: Amid inflation and rising interest rates, financial experts predict that the median university will experience negative returns on its endowment. Despite a lack of consensus on how the make-up of Harvard’s endowment, with its idiosyncratic reliance on alternative investments, will influence the exact outcome, it appears fairly likely that broader market conditions will lead to negative or at least declining returns for the University.
This situation isn’t new — and neither is the administration’s predictable response. Following the 2008 recession, which hit the endowment particularly hard, Harvard cut the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ budget by $77 million dollars, delayed construction of the Allston campus, froze faculty hiring, laid-off hundreds of workers, and cut back on hot breakfast. In fear of a potential recession during the Covid-19 pandemic, Harvard announced that it would end compensation for contracted workers idled by the pandemic, reduce pay for faculty, and freeze hiring and salaries. It seems likely that, should the anticipated negative returns on the endowment materialize, the administration will once again trim the University’s operating budget, given that 39 percent of it is funded by the endowment.
We appreciate that Harvard, out of fiscal responsibility, may be forced to slash our budgets. It’s not our place to advise the University on how to best manage its finances; Harvard retains plenty of experienced financial officers and world-class economists that are far better equipped to do so. However, as students, we can advise the University on what we know best — the parts of life at Harvard that deliver the oft-touted transformational student experience, and those which we consider to be indispensable, even in the face of looming budget cuts.
As we have previously opined, financial aid is a crucial part of Harvard’s institutional commitment to socioeconomic justice and diversity — one that cannot, under any circumstances, be sacrificed. When poor market conditions cause even an institutional behemoth like Harvard to struggle, economically disadvantaged students also suffer — but instead of worrying over a decrease in expected returns, students may be uncertain of their ability to afford and enroll in college altogether. When the endowment sinks, Harvard must continue its generous financial aid policy so that all are able to navigate the oft-treacherous waters of graduating with little to no student debt.  Additionally, provisions such as BoardPlus that are covered within attendance costs — and which can often play an important role in providing financial flexibility to students — should remain unaffected by budget cuts.
This emphasis on financial accessibility, in our view, is a crucial element of maintaining a standard of academic excellence at Harvard; after all, what is the value of a school without its students? To this point, however, we must also acknowledge the tremendous amount of labor required to maintain the educational apparatus and physical spaces that students utilize on a daily basis, which form an equally central part of Harvard’s academic mission. The University’s graduate student workers, non-tenured faculty, and non-teaching staff work tirelessly to sustain everything, from captivating courses to dining hall delights, that we as undergraduates hold dearest — efforts that have historically been devalued as soon as financial trouble hits. This time around, however, if budget cuts are in order, the University should avoid making payroll cuts and layoffs for those who rely almost entirely on Harvard for their wages, and ensure that all compensation levels unquestionably provide enough to be considered liveable wages.
If negative endowment returns mean that the University ultimately must sacrifice certain essential features of campus life, it should not capitalize on lapses in institutional memory to do away with them indefinitely. We’re thinking, as most students do when they find themselves hungry and far from Quincy in the morning, of hot breakfast — what was originally a necessary measure during the 2008 financial crisis has now become a seemingly permanent loss, cemented by a diminishing community memory of what it was like when we didn’t have to trek along the River for eggs and bacon. This example may seem trite, but the broader sentiment holds true: When making cuts, Harvard should avoid circumstantial decisions that may prove to be shortsighted and unnecessarily harsh when the storm eventually withers off.
Most importantly, in our view, Harvard should prioritize current jobs and programs that people depend on for their livelihoods as opposed to capital investment in assets that will remain idle for a long time. We also worry about the University’s future — but we know that Harvard must survive the present as well.

It’s a 9 a.m. discussion section the Monday after Harvard-Yale, and Sever 102 is filled with bleary eyes, fresh cups of coffee, and a musty aroma. Greg, the TF, wants to be in bed just as bad as everyone else does, but he has a job to do.
He fakes a smile and gets to work. “Okay y’all, let’s get started. I understand everyone had a busy weekend with Harvard-Yale, but I hope you had some time to devote to this week’s reading. What are some initial thoughts on the piece?” he asks.
“Well, Harvard-Yale was a blast! I didn’t make it to the actual game because … but I saw my family friend’s cousin at the afterparty and … you know. How was everyone else’s weekend? I want details,” Emily begins brightly.
Greg scrunches his face in confusion at this off-topic admission of a drunk hookup, attempting to steer the conversation back in the right direction. “A pleasure as always, Emily, but let’s save the Harvard-Yale talk for the end of section. Okay everyone, thoughts on the book? Let’s hear ’em.”
“Well,” Charles drawls. Multiple people in the class sigh in unison. “I felt that there was an absence of certain perspectives in the piece.”
Greg takes a deep breath before forcing himself to continue. “Feel free to elaborate.”
“Well,” Charles resumes, “I wish there was more of an epistemological reconstruction of the power dynamics exemplified in the racial hierarchies established by the author.”
The class goes silent as everyone tries to break down what the hell was just said.
“What an interesting perspective! Could you explain that some more?” Thomas asks.
“Well, I personally did not feel as if my personal stakes in this piece were as high as they should have been,” Charles replies.
“Personally, as a Black woman, I couldn’t disagree more. The assumption that white men have to be at the center of everything is the problem with the world, Charles,” Tanya bites back.
Thomas nods thoughtfully, “Piggybacking off of that actually, I was wondering if anyone else felt the same way?”
Emily closes the Shein tab on her laptop and jumps in. “In this case, I feel as if representation isn’t the key factor in debates such as these. The earth is warming up, people. Let’s do something useful, like talk about climate change instead. Now, I heard —”
“Thank you Emily!” Greg interrupts abruptly. “Anyone else have something to say? Preferably about the readings? Max, you’ve been a bit quiet, do you have anything to add?”
Max stares at Greg blankly. “Nope.”
The class is silent except for the cough of a lone freshman who has been meaning to buy cold medicine for three weeks.
“Really, nothing? It can be totally unrelated,” Greg continues.
Greg looks across the room at Emily with her hand up, bursting at the seams ready to make her big contribution.
Greg knows what is coming, but he’s all out of options.
“Yes, Emily?”
“What’s the ethical implication of a room full of Harvard kids talking about this? We’re all trapped in an ivory tower of academia anyways, it’s not like it will have any effect. Meanwhile, climate change —”
“Okay! Next person!” Greg exclaims.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Tanya replies. “Speaking from personal experience, the notion of valid intellectual thought only being derived from archaic institutions is elitist, classist, and inherently racist.”
“Building off Tanya’s comment, I find it intriguing how we are able to question our role in upholding elitist institutions from within the most elite institution of all ...”
As Thomas trails off, Greg reaches his breaking point. “Okay, let’s go ahead and call it. I get it, Harvard-Yale, Yuck Fale, all that crap, but this is the most useless section I’ve ever been in. Did a single one of you do the readings?”
The class stares at him wide-eyed, their silence an admission of their guilt.
“Yeah, I could tell,” Greg continues. “Emily, find something to talk about other than climate change — seriously, it’s exhausting. Charles, no one knows what you are saying, and the little that is understandable is elitist. Do better. Thomas, ask one more question and I’m failing you. Max, have you ever had a thought in your life? Tanya … um … maybe let’s ground our ideas in the readings a bit more? Great work though, love the insight.”
The class sits there frozen, unsure of if they’ve really been excused or not.
“What are you looking around for? Get out and recover from the weekend. You all look a mess. Let’s try a bit harder next week, alright?”

Abbie C. White planted her first pawpaw tree in 1989 on a whim, as part of a larger project to turn her property into an edible landscape. She liked its glossy, deep green foliage, and that its fruits grew well without the use of pesticides. Today, the “Pawpaw Queen” of Hardwick, Mass., attracts customers from as far away as Quebec City — and most of her fruit is already reserved for the season.
Cambridge locals might recognize pawpaws from Clover Food Lab, which sells the fruit for one to two weeks each year. This year, Clover is selling boxes of 3 pawpaws for $25 — limited to two boxes per customer. “It’s October and we just got our first shipment of paw paws from our secretive paw paw farmers,” reads the blurb on the site, urging customers to preorder pawpaws two weeks in advance.
Asimina triloba, known commonly as pawpaws, are a fruit native to North America. They’re about the size of an apple, with a thick, black-spotted, light green skin, a grainy and custardy flesh, and seeds the size of quarters. They taste like a cross between a banana and a mango. While pawpaws have been in Massachusetts for millions of years and have historically served as an important foraged food source, the past few years have seen a sharp increase in both demand for the fruit and excitement surrounding its native Northeast origins, sustainable reputation, and unique taste.
After White successfully raised her first pawpaw tree, she planted a few more varieties: Shenandoah, Susquehanna, and Rapanoic. Within just two years, the Shenandoah trees were loaded with fruit. Thus began White’s career as “The Pawpaw Queen,” a moniker she picked up from her colleagues at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, to whom she would bring pawpaws in the early years. She has since left WPI, but the title has stuck.
In 2007, White started selling pawpaws at her local farmers market.. “I want to help my community thrive in agriculture,” says White. “We have a lot of farmers in my area, so if people are interested in the pawpaw fruit, why don’t they come to the farmers market and help all of our vendors?”
In recent years, White has started receiving requests to reserve pawpaws starting in July and August. This year, by early September, most of White’s fruit had been reserved.
“There’s so many people that want trees, they want fruit, and I keep updating my website — but it seems the more I try to say ‘there’s a lot of demand,’ the more people want them,” White says.
Clover’s pawpaw grower wishes to remain secret to avoid the kind of high demand White is experiencing. At first, White found it funny that Clover’s supplier wished to remain anonymous, but she’s since grown sympathetic: “What I’ve been dealing with … I kind of miss the old days when nobody bothered me,” White says, laughing.
Each year, more people are trying pawpaws for the first time and falling in love with their tropical taste and vogue mysteriousness. But the pawpaw isn’t new, and it’s not going anywhere.
Archaeological evidence from sites ranging from Mississippi to New Jersey suggests pawpaws have been in North America for about 56 million years. Their seeds were dispersed by megafauna — giant ground sloths, wooly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and other large creatures that once roamed the area. Seeds have also been found at the earliest human settlements on the continent; after the megafauna went extinct, it was Native Americans across the continent who kept the pawpaw alive by spreading and planting its seeds by hand.
When SEAS Faculty Coordinator Anna V. Frej first read about the pawpaw, she was struck by the fruit’s foundation in both archaeology and sustainability. “I thought the pawpaws were the perfect catalyst to discuss ancient climate change and farming practices,” she says.
Pawpaws are considered to be one of the most sustainable fruits to grow for two main reasons: first, because they’re native to the Northeast, pawpaws are adapted to the climate and rarely require resources or succumb to disease; second, very few animal species alive today feed on pawpaws, so there is little need for farmers to use pesticides on their trees.
In 2017 and 2018, for her thesis at the Harvard Extension School, Frej explored the feasibility of pawpaw cultivation in New England from the perspective of sustainable agriculture. Her project took her to pawpaw sites around the Northeast and as far as Albany, Ohio, for the 19th Annual Ohio Pawpaw Festival.
“I hypothesize that yes, it could be [feasible] within the New England region,” Frej says. “I think that with climate change and warming, this is going to be an ideal location for the potential to start a pawpaw farm.”
According to Frej’s calculations, within the next 30 years, nearly all of New England, among other regions where the pawpaw currently thrives, will be the ideal climate for pawpaws to grow.
Frej notes that pawpaws can be a profitable crop if farmers grow them in conjunction with other staples. “Some years they have great years and some years they don’t,” Frej says. “No one just grows one thing.”
Methods of pawpaw cultivation vary depending on geographic area and scale. Chris Chmeil, a longtime pawpaw farmer and founder of the Ohio Pawpaw Festival, raises pawpaws alongside goats. His farm, Integration Acres, employs silvopastoralism — a method that integrates grazing livestock with forests. Goats don’t eat pawpaws, so they can be raised in pawpaw groves, grazing the land around the trees, which reduces growers’ need to clear land. Goats also fertilize the soil with their feces, which attracts flies and beetles that pollinate the pawpaws.
Like Frej, Chmeil became interested in pawpaws from a sustainable agriculture point of view. He calls himself an “ecopreneur of sorts.” After studying economic anthropology in college and graduating with a degree in sustainability, he wanted to create value out of the pawpaws that he saw rotting on the ground in Southeastern Ohio, where pawpaw trees are abundant.
“What I thought I brought to the table of the pawpaw was wanting to preserve it,” Chmeil says, “and one of the challenges is its short shelf life and how crappy they wind up looking after they’re ripe.”
Integration Acres is one of the only growers to ship raw pawpaws and pawpaw trees in addition to prepared products such as pawpaw salsa, pawpaw jam, pawpaw salad dressing, and frozen pawpaw pulp.
Though never planted on a large-scale like other fruits, pawpaws have been present throughout American history. At one point during their expedition westward, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark subsisted for three days on pawpaws alone. Thomas Jefferson sent pawpaw seeds to associates in Europe as an example of a uniquely American fruit. George Washington planted them at Mount Vernon.
But perhaps most importantly, pawpaw foraging has proven an important foodway for those without regular access to food supply. They’ve been foraged by people living in food deserts, enslaved people, people experiencing homelessness, and by the tribes who first cultivated them.
The pawpaw’s history as a vital food source stands in contrast to its current cult following. On one hand, you may find pawpaws on the ground in the woods. On the other hand, you can buy 3 of them from Clover for $25 (the price bears repeating).
Somewhere in between is The Mushroom Shop in Somerville, where owner Tyler M. Akabane sells pawpaws alongside locally foraged mushrooms. Last year, Akabane donated 50 percent of the sales from pawpaws to the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, writing to his Instagram followers: “This fruits occurrence [sic] in this region is largely thanks to indigenous stewardship … This fruit along with #ramps reminds me that we (or many of us) are on stolen land. And that while it may be very difficult to right the wrongs, we can make some steps to make things … less wrong?”
In his work with mushrooms, Akabane has seen a similar disconnect between those who forage to survive and those who are willing to pay higher costs for foraged foods as a delicacy. “It’s kind of the same thing — it can be very boujee in the restaurants, you can get a wild mushroom pasta that’s really expensive, but if you’re poor, it’s also free food,” he says.
For those looking to forage for pawpaws, Theodore B. Ruegsegger has made it easier. Ruegsegger has endeavored to restore the pawpaw in New England as much as he can. When he goes on hikes, he’ll plant half a dozen trees in a small circle so they grow into a thicket. So far, at least 40 of his trees around Massachusetts and Connecticut have sprouted.
“When the settlers — I hate that word, it’s like there was nobody settled here before — when the white settlers came in, they cleared all the fertile bottomland along rivers to make farms, and that’s where pawpaws like to grow, so they probably wiped out a lot of them,” Ruegsegger says, “So I’m giving ’em a little help getting back.”
As pawpaws have become more popular, more people are growing them at home. “I’m 62, and I’m having a lot of fun with this, but I will be at some point happy to reclaim my Sundays,” says White, laughing. “I’m excited that people are growing trees, and they’ll send me photos of their seedlings or flowers, and I’m like ‘yes, that’s wonderful!’”
For people interested in growing their own pawpaws, Ruegsegger has some advice: Take the seeds you have left over from your pawpaws in the fall. Find the right place to plant them — one that’s not too dry and has access to sun. Come back in spring. Over the winter, the seed will have prepared to sprout, and will send its first shoot up in May. You won’t see any green until August, though, as the seed makes its taproot, solidifying its place in the earth. Take note of your GPS coordinates. Check back in a few years. You may just have fruit.

DSA: That’s funny. I get asked that question a lot. People say, “Danielle, you’re so optimistic. How can you be so optimistic? It’s such a horrible world.” And you know what I always say back? It’s not exactly that I’m an optimist; I’m just a person who believes that failure is not an option. So I’m a “not-an-optionist!”
FM: Something that struck me when I read about your gubernatorial campaign was that it filled you with a renewed sense of hope. Since so many people leave politics disillusioned, I’m interested in how you seemingly left with another perspective.
DSA: Let’s be honest — when I started my campaign, I had basically zero name recognition. So as I would visit with people, they were incredibly frank and ready to share really personal experiences, challenges, worries, and concerns. So you develop this very deep sense of responsibility for the stories and hopes people would trust to you.
The other lesson that was just so profound was that we talked so much about how much cynicism there is in our politics, and yet they wanted to share, they wanted to tell somebody who might be governor! That’s how much faith we continue to have that our institutions can actually do right for us.
FM: For many undergraduates, Harvard is a very insulated environment. What is your recommendation for how can integrate a broader social perspective into our lives?
DSA:  The University is so intellectually rich, and it's a really wonderful place to be. We put all these amazing opportunities in front of people, and that can mean that you get sort of pulled inside. I do think one has to be intentionally proactive about taking all that richness and connecting it to real-world contexts. I think that the Mindich Program for engaged teaching and learning is really terrific, but it's a sort of set of courses that do really link up the classroom context to work in a variety of different kinds of civil society organizations and the like. So it really connects good, old-fashioned book learning with project-based learning and starts to fuse those things together.
FM: One of the things that I thought was interesting about the Undergraduate Council referendum last year was that there was a lot of vitriol and a lot of anger despite the absences of any political parties. I am curious, do you have any perspective on why that might be?
DSA: Well, I think you’re naming an experience a lot of people have. Vitriol is a part of all of our lives, I think, at a rate we all would prefer not to have. So I do think the problem is not just about partisanship but that there’s a kind of broader set of challenges that also do affect how our parties operate. They’re part of the same environment. I was a part of something called the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics for an eight- or nine-year stretch, just after Facebook was invented, and I do think that social media, if you are in an algorithmically driven universe that rewards outrage, has had a broad effect on our culture, our practices, and habits of interaction. So I think we are in a place where we need to proactively learn how to have decent fights.
FM: What are the biggest roadblocks to those kinds of civil discussions?
DSA: There are some basic things that people can learn. There was one student who said, “I learned how to really dissect a question and how to fully process something before speaking on the subject.” That sounds like a small thing, but if you are doing that really intentionally with others, it really can change the dynamic of a conversation.
This is where I would pull together the issue of practical public problem solving with relational challenges. When you have an actual problem that doesn’t have an ideological frame that you have to solve together, then you can build a relationship to solve that problem. But in the course of doing that, you actually learn ways of talking through and about ideological differences.
FM: That’s very interesting. I think Gretchen Whitmer said at the beginning of her campaign for Governor of Michigan, “fix the damn roads,” which I guess is a very common cause place to start. On the topic of common cause, what is your perspective on what we as citizens owe each other at this moment?
DSA: I would just quote Martin Luther King, Jr. and say we owe each other the full sharing of power and responsibility. Then the question is, what does it actually take to deliver that to each other? It takes respectfulness. It takes participation, not just letting males do all the work, not being a free rider; it takes chipping in. But it all flows from the fact that we owe each other full sharing of power and responsibility.
FM: I think there’s a lot of policy implications that stem from that in a very immediate sense that are fairly profound. One of the policies you suggested was expanding the House of Representatives. That’s something that sounds initially very small. But when you think about what the practical implications are, they’re actually fairly large.
DSA: It wouldn’t have been large if they had not bothered to cap the House 100 years ago. They produced a problem that we didn’t need to have. That’s what’s frustrating about it, because it should have been a slow evolution, one decade to the next. That’s what it was built to do. Basically, this is a beautiful, very significant example of deferred maintenance. We have deferred maintenance on our House, on Congress, and therefore it is much harder to do than if we have been, every 10 years, expanding the House.
FM: I suppose, in many senses, deferred maintenance is kind of the broader perspective we’ve taken on American democracy for maybe the last 50 years: democracy is something that’s innate to America. It’s something we know how to do, so it’s not something we need to practice.
DSA: I think that’s right. I think the deferred maintenance metaphor is a very helpful one for understanding where we are. And it’s hard because it’s not the whole story — because the House as originally built was never built for everyone, and some people were stuck in the dark basements while other people had light-filled rooms. So it’s a kind of combination of deferred maintenance and a meaningful renovation.
FM: I think that many people have a firmly rooted conception of what the House, or the Senate, look like. How feasible do you think it is for Americans to get out of that mindset? Are these going to be things we’re going to be able to change, perhaps, in our lifetimes?
DSA: It’s true, we look at the world and it’s so big and so complex it just feels really set in place, and we feel so very powerless in relation to it. I think the most important thing, honestly, is to connect people to their power again. And the truth is, if you can connect people to their power, then things begin to feel possible. So yes, I think these changes are possible in our lifetime.
FM: When you think of democratic leaders and representatives, what are the most important traits — ethically, morally, intellectually — that those leaders possess?
DSA: It’s really important that people in leadership roles be able to be synthetic, to synthesize across a whole lot of kinds of expertise and viewpoints. So it’s not the case that any single kind of expertise ever has the answers to a problem, because multiple kinds of expertise and conflicting frames will always be relevant. We want a broad community engaged in that process of diagnosis and solution, identification and decision, and so forth.
FM: One thing we’ve touched on a little bit earlier: Facebook has had a profound impact on democracy, both good and bad. In your mind, is there a version of social media that can have a net positive impact on democracy?
DSA: The great thing about the challenges we face with social media is how many people are thinking about them now. That’s the beautiful thing about human beings — once we all get clear that something is a problem, we solve it eventually. Lots of folks are just focused on how we regulate the social media platforms. But that’s honestly just a portion of it. There’s a question of how we redesign other elements of our institutions to mitigate against the negative externalities that flow from social media. But then there’s this sort of third bucket of positive experimentation. There’s a tool called Polis, a technological-based way of polling opinion but looking for synergies and common points of view, instead of trying to bring out the things that create outrage.
FM: Recently, with the anniversary of January 6, there was so much media attention on the Civil War in America. My question for you as someone who is very solution-oriented: the discussion of a potential civil war, the death of democracy — are those productive conversations to be having?
DSA: I really appreciate that there’s a lot of anxiety in our environment. People are stressed out about the events on January 6. They were scary and anger-inducing. So the question is really, given the significance of the episode and the kind of emotions it stirred up, how do we walk from that to something productive? That’s where I am a big supporter of trying to take things out of the national politics framework, look more locally, build partnerships. I don’t really think we can actually solve any of our problems without just literally building partnerships between people.
FM: That makes a lot of sense. I have a short final question: What media are you consuming?
DSA: I have to admit, in the media department, I’m really driven by my children. I took my daughter to a Cavetown concert, who was playing in the House of Blues. My son is totally dedicated to Minecraft, so I spent a lot of time consuming stuff about Minecraft or with him in relation to Minecraft.
FM: That’s very interesting. I guess Minecraft is really one of those places of communal problem solving.
DSA: But it’s also the toxicity that you were mentioning. My poor son, he just had all of his resources wiped out by some Minecraft bully, who convinced him they were doing a trade, and then, like, got his code and destroyed everything he built for months. So it’s bad out there!

Ever since she was a little girl, Ana Isabel Keilson wanted to be a professional dancer. But after years of dancing, her career trajectory took a major turn — now, she’s a lecturer in the Social Studies department at Harvard and runs an undergraduate education program that immerses students in nature.
After graduating college with a degree in English literature, Keilson packed up and headed to Europe, where she spent several months dancing with professional companies. In her free time traveling, she explored some of her non-dancing interests, even working on an olive farm through a wildlife conservation program.
Upon returning to the United States, Keilson began touring the New York modern dance scene, during which time she worked as a film archivist for Merce Cunningham, a prominent modern dancer and choreographer. As someone who had been dancing since she was a child and choreographing since high school, it was only natural for Keilson to join the group of rising independent artists in the city. Inspired by the experience and mentored by established artists in this scene, Keilson decided to form her own modern dance company.
However, as was the case for many emerging artists in New York, Keilson struggled to keep her company afloat financially, so she began looking for “creative ways to support my creative work.”
Inspiration came over coffee with a professor-turned-friend.
“He said, ‘If you get into a Ph.D. program at a wealthy institution, it’ll support your salary and health insurance, and you’ll have a bunch of time to work on your art for seven years,’” she says. “So I thought that sounded like a pretty good idea.”
After completing her Ph.D. in history at Columbia, she accepted a job offer in the Social Studies department at Harvard in 2017. An intellectual historian, Keilson’s current research is on the history of climate change through the lens of national security.
Though dance and choreography will always remain lifelong passions, Keilson is embracing the academic turn of her career.
“The more time I spent abroad, the more I realized that I was just interested in different things,” she says. “I began to phase out professional artistic work as I became more committed to academia.”
In February 2020, Keilson was invited to teach at Deep Springs College, a two-year liberal arts college located on an alfalfa farm in rural California. But then the pandemic struck, and her plans were delayed by a year of Zoom teaching while “cooped up” in her apartment with her kids. Keilson and her husband finally arrived in Deep Springs in the summer of 2021.
“We were really impressed with the pedagogical structure of the college, which is based on the three pillars of academics, physical labor, and student self-governance,” she says. She found the experience “utterly transformative” and was “sad to leave.”
Yet another career turn came later that year, while on a boat in Cape Cod with family, when a friend gestured to a small island in the distance and wondered what it was. Keilson’s husband joked, “That’s where we’re gonna have our academics, manual labor, and student self-governance experiment.”
But as the couple made their way back to Cambridge, the flippant statement began taking shape as a real idea. They started introducing the idea to friends and colleagues, including those they had worked with at Deep Springs, and each time received enthusiastic feedback.
“Fast forward six months,” Keilson says, “we ran a week-long pilot program on an island in Buzzards Bay.”
This small, uninhabited Massachusetts island — one of the “Elizabeth Islands'' in Dukes County, Mass. — is called “Gull Island.” Relatively unknown, it formerly held a U.S. Navy bombing range.
Keilson described the Gull Island pilot program as a “place-based liberal arts program for advanced undergrads,” where students and faculty lived in a communal house with no potable water and limited electricity. Its pedagogical model, inspired by Deep Springs’, incorporates academics, manual labor, and student self-governance.
“The mission is to cultivate democratic citizenship in an age of climate change,” she says.
To fulfill the three pillars, each day began with seminars, transitioned into manual labor, and concluded with community meetings.
The program curriculum was heavily influenced by the geography of Gull Island itself — Keilson ensured students learned about the native history and ecology of the island. The faculty worked with the native Mashpee Wampanoag and Aquinnah tribes to develop the curriculum, which was guided by the overarching question: “What is the right relation to the land?”
For the manual labor aspect of the program, participants conducted aquaculture area assessments with agriculturists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, gardened, and performed general island upkeep.
In the coming years, Keilson plans to continue scaling up Gull Island — she’s running a four-week pilot in the early summer of 2023 and is currently working on developing the first set of applications, which will be open to juniors, seniors, and recent graduates.
“Whether you’re really excited about political philosophy or the arts or climate science, it really is a place where those kinds of disciplines break down,” she says.
Keilson’s unconventional road to academia may speak to her vision for Gull Island as an interdisciplinary learning space. Drawing on her wide-ranging interests — from dance to history to the climate crisis — Keilson ultimately hopes Gull Island will be a place where students and teachers can learn from each other and “students can ask questions about how they want to live.”

Two to three times a week, 75-year-old George D. Vaill sits outside the Harvard Square T station sporting a pair of goofy oversized glasses, a rainbow propeller hat, a smile, and a sign that reads “Free Advice: Offered or Accepted.” Vaill is almost always surrounded by a crowd of tourists talking in other languages, students rushing to and from class, and locals shopping, eating, and chatting.
Vaill, aka the “Free Advice Guy,” has become a familiar fixture in Harvard Square over the last two years since he started dedicating his free time to offering advice to passersby. He splits his time between the Square and farmers markets in Florida, where he lives for part of the year.
Vaill was inspired to start giving advice four years ago, when he heard of a group of five elderly men in Salt Lake City, Utah who spent every morning swapping stories at a local deli. “When they were tired of telling each other the same old lies, they decided to go to a farmers market, and they took a table and put up a banner that said ‘Old Coots Giving Advice,’” Vaill says. “And so two years ago, I decided to find a place to do it.” Vaill, tired of “the real estate game” and approaching retirement, felt as though it was time to try something different from his one-man business as a dental lease negotiator.
Now, Vaill regularly talks to many people who are looking for anything from a silly conversation to serious advice.
One of these people was Andy M. Wang ’25, who first approached Vaill on a whim. He and a friend walked up to Vaill and asked for advice on how to collaborate on a group project with friends. Vaill walked through scenarios with them and really tried to help them come to a conclusion. “At first we thought he was there as a joke … but he was pretty serious about it,” Wang says. “I respect that. He wants to help people.”
Vaill says the questions people ask range from lighthearted to weighty. He’s often asked things like, “What are you doing here?” “How should I handle my blind date tonight?” “How do I find a boy?” “Should I change my major?”
Some conversations are much more consequential, though. Vaill remembers when a woman came up to him and asked, “I’ve been married for 27 years, should I get a divorce?” When he asked how long she had been thinking about getting a divorce, she replied, “27 years.”
Asking these sorts of follow-up questions is a powerful strategy Vaill often uses. “People need to look within themselves to find the answers to a lot of their questions,” Vaill says. For instance, people often ask Vaill what is the meaning of life, and he usually urges people to rephrase the question and ask themselves, “What’s the best way to get something out of life or the best way to live your life?”
Although Vaill acknowledges that some questions are a little trickier to answer, he says that most of them fall back into the same vein: “They’re really about personal connections and relationships and people conducting their own lives.”
Vaill loves getting these little glimpses into people’s lives and making “fleeting connections” with them. They are brief but impactful. People often come back on a later day and thank him for the advice. In turn, Vaill feels these connections enhance his own life.
“Every one of us loves to be acknowledged by others in the human race,” he says. “When you walk up to me and you smile at me, it fills my heart. And when I smile back at you, it fills your heart. It really is that simple.”

I’m not sure how to write this piece. I don’t do much creative writing anymore.
It isn’t easy to get into a flow state. When I think of writing poetry and personal essays, I think of shutting the door to my childhood room in Atlanta and settling deep into the box I created for myself: my desk, my chair, the earphones that tethered me to my computer, and the same song for hours on repeat. There, I faced the window and watched the sky lose color.
What I remember best is the feeling of floating in a lake, dark and pulsing. I induced it by surrounding myself with music that was undulating, obsessively rhythmic, numbing, yet gut-piercing at the same time — “A L I E N S” by Coldplay, “Cornfield Chase” from “Interstellar,” “Middle of the World” from “Moonlight,” and “Arrival of the Birds” by The Cinematic Orchestra.
The lake isolated. Among the deadlines and busyness, there, time hung in suspense. It comforted like a womb. It hypnotized. The more I floated in it, the less I wanted to leave.
My most distinct memories of high school occurred in the four walls of that room. It was where I chained down my petulant mind, wrote my papers, and read my textbooks. It was also where I fled to make sense of my errant emotions, doubted my worth, and speculated about my own death — and where, most importantly, I wrote about it all.
I rarely published happy things. Happy writing lacked depth, I thought, and if I couldn’t develop close friendships, be sociable, explore the world, and have classic coming-of-age experiences, I could at least have depth. It was so much easier, handing someone a piece of paper that contained my voice without them having to face the physical, imperfect me.
Five years ago, I shared a piece about my family life during a workshop. It was the first time my writing made someone cry.
All I wanted was to do it again, so I forced my head below the waters.
***
Now, my mind rarely lets me get into the headspace required for deep, generative, personal writing. It’s 2 a.m., and I’m typing this sitting next to two friends. At midnight, I was doing work at my other friends’ dorm. From 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. (punctuated by dinner with other friends), I was editing and writing in our busy newsroom. That morning before seminar, I did my readings in our dining hall.
Anything to avoid being alone again.
Since coming to college, I talk a lot more, laugh a lot more, go on more outings with more people. I’ve become rambunctious, sometimes so much so it appalls me. I can spend a whole day with people and still want to seek more company at the end of the day.
The first summer I lived in Cambridge, I walked to Somerville, Brookline, Allston, Newbury Street, Chinatown, North End for hours and hours, alone. North End made me notice the hollow in my chest. People crowded the sidewalk and spilled onto the road. Couples smiled at each other over wine and candlelight. Ironed, wavy heads of hair wore black skirts, heels, and wallet-sized purses, while wafts of cologne followed button-downs, slacks, and sleek black loafers. Envy made me ache. I was too introverted to turn strangers into friends, but I felt their absence.
Loneliness had followed me around all my life, but I had not, until then, recognized it as a tragic thing — like a family member whose behavior you don’t recognize as strange and painful until you glimpse a normal life. The state of being alone, I assumed, was an inevitable feature of life. There was no one to miss.
In the two years since I started college, the only poems I’ve written have been about missing people. The only personal essays I’ve written came from emotional emergencies or reflections on significant personal growth.
The few times my mind has slipped back into the lake’s edge have made me see how deeply I once entrenched myself. The writing I did in high school largely started and continued from a need to make sense of immense pain, find closure by myself, and grow up. Once I started earning validation for losing myself in my pessimism, though, I couldn’t stop. I took up workshops, submitted pieces to magazines, and entered writing competitions.
Sometimes I wonder why there wasn’t an intervention. Why did no one read between the lines and pull me up, urge me to seek help from somewhere more complete than a sheet of paper? Had everyone gotten used to being underwater, breathless?
But even if they had reached out to me, I know I would have rejected their hand.
Their praise turned my words into something I finally recognized as beautiful and worthy, and more importantly, as my own. I carried around a notebook and rushed to document a dwindling sunset, a sickly orange streetlight, a misty forest. Writing made me more observant of the world, but the paper only caught the most painful parts of it. Would I be a good writer if I were happy? Would I know myself if I were happy?
I know now that I desperately wanted to connect. But I had no late nights spent sitting on our bedroom floors, no road trips, no movie nights, no asking each other if we were scared of the future. This was the only way — passing out my papers to peer evaluators, judges, teachers, editors, pulling strangers into the most personal parts of my life, and receiving sparse feedback.
The lake was mostly cold, but sometimes I felt warm currents. “This touched me,” they’d say. “Thank you for sharing this. This was deeply moving, Meimei.”
So I wrote myself into a corner and felt the four walls of my room close in.
***
My compulsion for walking began when the world locked itself up two and a half years ago. I walked over the bridge near Cumberland, past what was the construction site, along the stretch of road to Home Depot and Panera, and back across the I-285. I walked to places where we normally drove. I did laps around and around the mountain. I walked along the Chattahoochee and back. I walked until I reached the next town over.
Though I don’t write much anymore, I still walk. I can’t help but frame the world in language. On these long walks, I often imagine a person to my side, matching me stride-by-stride, like a shadow. We say nothing.
But they see the clouds how I see the clouds. They see the long stretch of interstate how I see it, feeling the bridge shake as the cars slice below our feet. They see the treetops the way I do, as frames for the sky, as dark blots from a matted brush. They see hills as tremendous, sweeping expressions of land. They hear music when they walk the earth — my terrible but beautiful music.
When I do walk with friends, though, the conversation blurs my vision. When we speak, my voice sometimes feels as if it is not my own. I know they can’t hear the story in my head, and being around them makes the words foggier.
I want to hear myself and others. I want to be happy in my solitude and feel at home in company. But sometimes, I feel I’ll always have to choose.
After everything, I can’t help but miss the sinking.

It was late on a Thursday and I was out of breath on a Bluebike, cruising across Weeks Bridge toward the Science and Engineering Complex. A night of sneaking around, looking for trouble in Harvard’s Allston bastion lay ahead of me.
The $1 billion, eight-story, 500,000-square-foot building, coldly abbreviated as SEC or “ess-ee-sea,” opened its doors to lectures and labs for the first time in the fall of 2021. Since its inception, it has been lauded for its energy-efficient features, its collaborative design, and its ultramodern amenities. As with the rest of Harvard’s developments in Allston, it has also drawn criticism for moving into existing neighborhoods. As students settled into its classrooms, offices, labs and makerspaces, rumors blossomed that some of them began to ditch the commute to and from Cambridge, instead creating a residence for themselves in the building.
It’s too convenient not to. Apparently, there are showers in the basement (true), a giant warehouse where you could skateboard (true, though I didn’t try), Peloton bikes (on the fifth floor, facing a glass wall), and pods for napping (I found benches instead). I jumped at the idea of spending a night there — partly for the meme, partly for the lure of experiential reporting, and partly to feel more connected to the colossal construction I only ever visit for math class. It seemed a good opportunity to hit up as much of this cornucopia as I could. Plus, I thought being inside one of the focal points of scientific innovation would activate a deeper level of my brain, allowing me to fly through all the homework I hadn’t finished earlier in the week.
Trader Joe’s in Allston, just up the road from the SEC, is a familiar stop on my commute to class, and tonight was no different. I picked up grub — tomatoes, dried mango, and microwavable mac and cheese — in an attempt to make the industrial interior where I would be staying more homely. I imagined the other shoppers were hurrying home after a late night in the lab; the cashier said at this time of day, there were only stragglers.
Prior to this, I had only ever seen the SEC in the mornings when I arrived for class, squinting against the sunlight reflecting on its glass edifice and bouncing across its metal exoskeleton. At night, it has an eerie glow instead. No one batted an eye when I strolled in at a quarter past nine. I settled my groceries into the fridge of an open-concept kitchenette in the basement. Feeling slightly more comfortable — ah yes, my $1 billion home — I posted up in a study room.
Over the next few hours, I worked on my pset. Around me, loose phrases of conversations and squeaks from shoes on clean tiles echoed through the atrium and down to the lower level where I was camped. The plaque on the glass of my study nook held a dedication to someone’s physics professor. This struck me as oddly quaint. In many of its design choices, the SEC nods to the history of engineering at Harvard; the beech saplings on the lawn are the same species as the ones that stand outside Pierce Hall, the former SEAS headquarters in Cambridge.
As part of its commitment to simulating storiedness, the SEC commissioned a kinetic art installation that hangs at the main entrance. The installation compiles digital silhouettes of every person who’s walked past, playing and replaying all the interactions it has observed since it was first plugged in, using tiny rotating tiles as pixels. On my first visit, the sudden whoosh of clicking and clacking tiles took me by surprise as I walked past. Tonight, though the SEC stood empty, I still heard the tiles click into shapes of people passing in and out, ad infinitum.
Eventually, the only other sound was the whir of air conditioners as the building heaved in anticipation of the next morning, when PIs and professors would trickle in. I wondered if anyone could smell the fake cheese of my dinner wafting.
Ultimately, I gave up on my homework. Overtaken by SEC wanderlust, I began to explore, starting in the basement until I made my way to the sixth floor.
Even though I was simply walking through the halls, the ceiling — an exposed web of metal pipes — made me feel as if I was a woefully ignorant car mechanic in the underbelly of a machine. I am not an engineer, so I don’t know what flows through the pipes, nor why, nor how, and seeing so many woven together was discomfiting. My dad had tried to explain these things: why the car battery could be charged just by driving far; why the dryer doesn’t work when it snows; why plugging in everything at once would blow the fuse. The SEC’s exposed pipes forces you to ask these questions, to realize that engineering abounds. Its persistence feels like mockery — I prefer to be ignorant to these inner workings.
The SEC is unimaginably endless. There are countless little study rooms and lab benches and kitchenettes built at oblique angles. I stumbled into a library, one lonely plant bed, and a meditation room. Just when I thought I was alone, I ran into a tired grad student struggling against a printer. Almost all the doors have a scanner on them, and I swiped at each, hoping more easter eggs await. This strategy did not get me very far. When the mystery was unresolved, I told myself there’s probably nothing there anyway. Most parts feel barely used, a new-car smell still faint on the paint. It feels like a too-large apartment.
In a few years’ time, perhaps the SEC will become the dynamic space it hopes to be. All the features beckon us to come and stay, work, 3D-print something useless, soak in the sun through the windows, exercise and shower, warm up a frozen meal, and wake up to a BoardPlus breakfast. It’s not quite settled yet. At dusk, when I headed back on the bike, there were no rats scampering until I got to the Square. No one was there to leave crumbs out for them.
Luckily, time is one thing that the SEC has plenty of. Certified for its sustainability by the International Living Future Institute and the U.S. Green Building Council, the building is also armed to stand the test of climate change, with special systems to manage stormwater and mitigate power outages. A pamphlet online advertises that it could outlast a 100-year-long rainstorm. I won’t be returning to the SEC for any more school-night shenanigans — but if the skies ever open up to a biblical storm, you’ll know where to find me.

On June 11, 1970, Harvard’s 319th Commencement ground to a halt.
Graduating senior Steven J. Kelman ’70 was delivering a speech where he talked about the “oppressed people of the world,” Saundra Graham recalled.
“Hell, he’s looking at them,” she thought. “But he ain’t talking about us.” So Graham, a Cambridge resident — 28 years old, wearing jeans and a red t-shirt, and several heads shorter than the administrators behind her — jumped over a row of chairs with a bullhorn in her right hand. A dozen activists holding protest signs followed her onstage, pushing past deans in graduation regalia and top hats.
Graham remembers that President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 tried to pull the microphone away from her. “Get the hell away from me,” she told him, “or I’ll punch you in your face.” When the power was cut anyway, she switched to her bullhorn.
“We are here to demand that Harvard University give to the residents of the Riverside area Treeland,” she said to the crowd, “so we can build low-income housing for the poor people of Cambridge.”
Treeland was a planned Harvard graduate student housing complex with two towers, 15 and 22 stories tall. It would be built on the Treeland-Bindery site at Memorial and Western, the latest in a series of University developments into Riverside, a working-class neighborhood southeast of the Square. Riverside, also called “Coast” in a nod to its Caribbean immigrant roots, had been home to a substantial Black community for 200 years.
The day before Commencement, Graham and the Riverside Planning Team, a housing activist group, had intended to take their demands directly to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board. Close to 350 tenants, mostly mothers and their children, marched to the Yard on June 10, asking to meet with Corporation members.
“Part of the problem,” Graham told the Record American before the demonstration, “is that we’ve been getting commitments from Harvard that aren’t commitments at all.”
None of the Corporation members would meet with them, so the team decided to wait. Though some undergraduate students offered to host them in their dorms, the 75 members of the team opted to camp out in the Yard instead, sleeping under tents in the southwest corner.
On the morning of Commencement, the team again asked to meet with Corporation members, Graham recalls. They heard nothing. Seeing few options for getting through to Harvard’s decision-makers, the group decided to stage a protest during the event.
“We have been here longer than you’ll ever be here,” Graham continued through her bullhorn, to an audience split between cheers and boos, “and we’re not going to move because of you.”
Eventually, Pusey stepped back up to the mic. “Members of the Harvard Corporation have very generously volunteered to go to University Hall to meet with this group — in which case we go forward,” he told the crowd to applause.
Several members of the Harvard Corporation sat down with the activists in a lecture hall to review their list of demands. After hours of deliberation, they reached an agreement. The University would commit to building low-income housing — but not on the Treeland site, Graham remembers them telling her. “They told us that the land was too valuable for low income people,” she says.
But by October 1971, Harvard had scrapped its plans for the enormous housing development, in part due to months of pressure from Graham and her team. Today, a public park stands where Treeland would have been.
Graham — who later became the first Black woman on the Cambridge City Council, as well as the first Black woman to represent Cambridge in the state legislature — is 81 now. When we knock on the door of the Riverside home she has owned for 45 years, she answers in a fuzzy gray robe.
She still goes to community meetings, and she still says exactly what she thinks. Of the Corporation members she met with after the Commencement protest, she says, “Their faces were blank, like they’d never heard of low-income people.” And of Riverside now?
“The community is gone,” Graham says. “There’s only a few of us left.”
Today, Harvard students may know Riverside as the neighborhood they have to walk through to get to Whole Foods, full of leafy streets and renovated homes. Despite the success of activists like Graham in halting Harvard’s development there, other forces — like growing student populations, aggressive real estate development, and regulatory changes like the end of rent control — continued to gentrify the neighborhood and push residents out.
But the Treeland fight still marked an important episode in both Riverside and Harvard’s history. The fight was a rare instance of grassroots activism that derailed a major project over just a year — and just about the final episode in Harvard’s expansion in Cambridge.
Hundreds of archival Harvard documents, recently unsealed after a 50-year moratorium, and interviews with longtime Riverside residents illustrate the rise and rapid fall of the Treeland project. They depict the impact sustained activism had on a powerful university eager to expand, yet equally wary of negative publicity.
As the University has developed in Allston, it has used similar techniques to gain a foothold, even as it has made a concerted effort to incorporate community input. Understanding what happened in Riverside may cast light on Harvard’s continued expansion, across the river and into the 21st century.
President Pusey and Edward S. Gruson, an aide in charge of community affairs, sat down to lunch on Sept. 16, 1970. An avid birdwatcher and fan of a “four-martini lunch,” Gruson was Pusey’s eyes and ears as Harvard navigated real estate development in Cambridge. Over lunch, they discussed the shortage of University housing for Harvard graduate students — and how the already-planned Treeland development might provide a solution.
In an October 1970 letter recounting the lunch to a city councilor, Gruson cited some startling statistics: Due to a shortage of University housing, 3,655 of Harvard’s 8,360 graduate students lived in private rentals across Cambridge. Counting faculty members, Harvard affiliates were estimated to take up 2,238 city apartments — about 6 percent of the city’s housing stock in 1970.
To make matters worse, University affiliates who lived off campus were driving up rents for other residents. An internal report from 1968 found that “persons connected with the university, or seeking to live in its shadow, have bid up the price of housing at an astronomic rate.” Faculty members and groups of students, the report said, could vastly outspend local families on rent. The city recognized rising housing costs as an issue, too, instituting rent control in 1970.
With these issues in mind, Gruson’s 1970 letter continued, new housing construction was necessary to “decrease the pressure on the existing housing supply of the City.”
So Harvard looked to the Treeland-Bindery site, which had once held the Harvard University Bindery and the Treeland Christmas tree nursery. The bindery had moved to that location in 1930, but was relocated in 1958 after decades of financial distress. Until at least the 1950s, the nursery was run by Raymond S. McLay, called the “Christmas tree man” for his practice of delivering hundreds of free Christmas trees to children whose families could not afford them.
The Treeland proposal would have added to Harvard’s string of buildings that towered between the neighborhood and the Charles, following Peabody Terrace, a married graduate student housing complex built in 1964, and Mather House, which wrapped up construction in 1970. The projects took advantage of unlimited-height zoning districts that Harvard had spent years campaigning for, and which the city established in 1962.
In addition to viewing development as important to increase student housing options, administrators framed it as advantageous for the surrounding areas. As the Harvard Planning Office claimed in a 1960 report: “A university has a recognizable, beneficial effect on the economy of a community. This fact can well be observed in Cambridge. Property tends to improve as it is located closer to the University.”
But this optimistic statement elided the details of what “improvement” looked like for longtime tenants, something activists frequently emphasized.
A 1969 pamphlet published by an anti-ROTC group, titled “Harvard, Urban Imperialist,” quotes Pusey as saying: “Harvard preceded Cambridge and is the most important thing going on here.” In a narrow sense, this was true; Harvard became a college before Cambridge became a city. But for the most part — in areas like Riverside, as well as Kerry Corner, the adjacent neighborhood named for its Irish immigrant population — Cambridge preceded Harvard. And to build the sprawling university it envisioned, Harvard-as-developer needed to push longtime residents out.
Before the 1930s, the area where the River Houses now sit was also part of Kerry Corner. Working-class Irish immigrants’ homes, which a Harvard alumni organization called “a poor class of property,” lined Mill, Plympton, and Dunster Streets, which were often called “the marsh” for their closeness to the river.
The construction of Lowell, Dunster, and the Malkin Athletic Center in the ’30s required demolishing 59 houses. In 1924, a local priest lamented that construction had displaced “a Catholic population estimated at 1,200-1,500 souls,” according to Susan E. Maycock and Charles M. Sullivan’s “Building Old Cambridge.”
This process accelerated when Pusey became University president in 1953; his tenure was an “era of prolific building,” Maycock and Sullivan write.
In 1956, “Harvard started buying all the property it could get its hands on,” says an activist in the documentary “Left on Pearl.” “And if they were two- or three-family homes, they would evict the tenants.”
To build Leverett, Quincy, Mather, and Peabody Terrace, Harvard destroyed 104 more buildings. In all, the construction of the new House system and Peabody Terrace evicted and displaced more than 300 families.
When Harvard purchased a new building in a residential neighborhood, it did not always demolish it immediately. In a process called “landbanking,” the University sometimes acquired land and sat on it, often forced to wait the better part of a decade to buy up all the houses on a block before eventually razing them to make way for new Harvard buildings. Often, the University used shell companies to buy up land, concerned potential sellers would hike prices if they knew Harvard was buying.
In the meantime, since Harvard had no incentive to maintain buildings on its new landbanked acquisitions, it let many of them deteriorate. In 1978, The Crimson wrote that “landbanking can potentially turn an owner into a slumlord; the building is only secondary to the property value.”
“Harvard was a shitty landlord — because they didn’t keep up the buildings,” recalls Judith E. Smith ’70, then an undergraduate at Radcliffe involved with feminist organizing.
Harvard used landbanking and demolition to take over entire city blocks, where it could then construct new buildings. These practices were employed when building Peabody Terrace and Mather House, too; Riverside residents were displeased but presented little formal resistance.
Yvonne L. Gittens, a lifelong Riverside resident, jokes that her neighbors hoped Peabody, an immense, Brutalist complex, would “fall into the river.” According to one study, Peabody’s architects could have fit the same amount of units and parking in four-story buildings, rather than its 22-story, three-tower footprint — that is, the structure’s excesses stemmed less from necessity than aesthetic preference. Some Black and Irish families felt they had been “pushed aside to make room” for the construction of Mather in 1970, The Crimson wrote in a 1995 retrospection.
But despite this discontent, opposition was rarely vocal. Riverside residents “weren’t organized then,” Graham says.
The University had no reason to believe its next housing development would face any substantial pushback. In fact, according to Harvard Professor Suzanne P. Blier, who teaches a course on the history of Harvard Square, Mather’s construction came with an aura of authority; she describes Mather’s location on the border between Harvard and the surrounding communities as communicating that “We are here and we’re here to stay.”
Harvard began to move ahead with its decades-old strategy of landbanking and wrecking-ball development to build Treeland, one of its most ambitious projects to date. “Harvard had bought up the whole front of the river,” says an activist in “Left on Pearl.” Treeland would be the final piece.
Saundra Graham knew she had to do something. Growing up in Riverside, she had watched landlords evict her neighbors in dramatic scenes that played out on the street. “They were screaming, they were crying, and they all had children,” she says.
Sometimes, landlords would throw their tenants out in hopes of selling to Harvard. In the 1960s, it was Graham’s own mother who got an eviction notice. “When [the landlord] found out Harvard was looking to buy, he emptied his building,” she says. This experience helped fuel Graham’s activism in the 1960s.
The late ’60s were “tumultuous,” Graham says. “It was one thing after another after another, and people were getting tired.”
Graham herself had participated in another series of protests against a city proposal to build the so-called Inner Belt, an eight-lane highway that would have cut through her backyard. In its form proposed in 1962, the Inner Belt would have destroyed 2,200 housing units and displaced as many as 13,000 people.
In May 1967, 78 adults and 25 kids rode a bus from Cambridge to Washington, D.C., to meet with members of Congress about the proposed highway. As Cambridgeport resident Anstis Benfield recalled in a 2022 Cambridge community history conference, the kids spent all night singing:
Cambridge is a city, not a highway.
They will never build roads through our homes.
So we are going to stop the highway
And beat the Belt, beat the Belt, beat the Belt in Washington.
Benfield described participating in years of protests that met at first with resistance. After residents nailed petitions to the doors of City Hall, the city replaced the wooden doors with glass ones.
But by 1969, after a 2,000-person march to the State House, Massachusetts Governor Francis W. Sargent expressed something close to regret over his role in planning the highway years before. “I want you to know, we will not place people below concrete,” he said. “We are going to place concrete below people.” In 1971, Sargent rejected the Inner Belt proposal entirely and announced that the money saved would be put toward mass transit.
Community organizing against the Inner Belt paralleled the pushback Harvard began to receive from its working-class neighbors in Boston. While the Inner Belt was scrapped, Harvard continued developing. In the late 1960s, Harvard purchased a huge swath of land near the present-day Brigham and Women’s Hospital campus in what was then Roxbury, intending to expand existing Medical School and hospital facilities. As the University moved to evict the tenants and demolish their homes, residents began to organize with Harvard students.
The Roxbury Tenants of Harvard, an advocacy organization, called on Harvard to prioritize displaced residents in the new housing it was building. In a November 1969 letter, Robert S. Parks, the organization’s president, pressed Gruson, Pusey’s aide for community affairs, to budge on points the group deemed unacceptable: high rents and apartments too small to fit larger families.
What Harvard considered “affordable” rent still posed “a great hardship for many low-income families,” Parks wrote. “This,” he asserted, “is not low-income housing.”
In the end, Harvard demolished some homes, replaced them with high-rise towers, and offered some relocation assistance to those displaced. Families who had their home destroyed and were forced to relocate to a new high-rise were offered $400 — the equivalent of a little over $3,000 today.
In Riverside, discontent was beginning to mount. “We were just being chased all over the place by Harvard,” Graham says. “I said, nuh-uh, this has got to be a David and Goliath — we’ve got to get them somehow.’”
As the looming Peabody and Mather cast long shadows over the neighborhood, and evictions kept coming, Graham and her neighbors started to informally organize. “If we knew someone was getting evicted, we would call [each other],” she says, in an attempt to stop the eviction from occurring. She also worked with Harvard students, who informed her of the latest on the University’s development plans.
Around the same time, student activism on campus was reaching a fever pitch. In 1969, Pusey had ordered a violent police crackdown on students occupying University Hall to protest ROTC and the Vietnam War. In the spring of 1970, members of Students for a Democratic Society across 416 campuses went on strike; at Harvard, they advocated for anti-war demands, a Black Studies department, and an end to expansion into Riverside.
In April of 1970, an anti-war protest swelled to a 3,000-person riot on Mt. Auburn Street, where 300 people were injured. In the fray, students pelted nearly 1,200 police officers with bricks and rocks. The police responded by firing tear gas into Quincy and Lowell courtyards and into the interior of Adams House, where, The Crimson wrote, “gas fumes choked students in Claverly.”
1970 represented a climactic point for activism on and around campus, the culmination of years of pressure on Harvard to concede to myriad demands. Police crackdowns on student protests were met with shock and anger — Pusey would resign a year later — contributing to a heightened sensitivity around bad publicity. Harvard’s real estate model had not changed; it was still eager to complete its vision along the riverfront. But over the previous decade, organizers had built coalitions, sharpening their organizing tools, learning what worked.
When Graham and other activists began to protest against Treeland, it was this environment that fed their fight. As their demands and tactics came into closer focus, they put Harvard on the defensive.
A few months before the Planning Team marched on Commencement, Gruson already seemed concerned.
In a March 1970 letter to then-professor Archibald Cox, he voiced worries about the influence of new “community organizers,” whom he feared would allow Harvard’s neighbors to “develop a new militancy based on a ‘black–brown coalition.’”
In its previous construction projects, Harvard had kept close tabs on resident pushback. In a 1970 letter about a community meeting for a West Cambridge development, Gruson wrote: “We will have people there although we are not invited,” adding that he hoped to “handle it at a low noise level.”
When Riverside activists began meeting with Harvard administrators in the spring of 1970, their tactics were relatively quiet. The Planning Team, beleaguered after more than a decade of Harvard landbanking and eviction in their neighborhood, presented a list of demands. The team wanted the University to commit to building low and moderate-income housing in Riverside, and wanted the ability to negotiate the number of units directly with the Harvard Corporation. They also called for new family housing in Riverside to replace the hundreds of units lost in Harvard’s decades of eviction and demolition.
“In this connection,” wrote Gruson in a March 1970 letter to Pusey and other officials, “the roles of Mather House and Peabody Terrace in removing housing and closing ‘their’ streets was aired again.” Gruson was also acutely aware of how Harvard’s past development practices shaped what residents expected of it in the present. “There are groups of people who believe that only by the expenditure of its own endowment funds can Harvard ‘expiate its sins,’” he wrote in the same letter. “There is a note of ‘reparations’ creeping into the rhetoric of the situation.”
On May 30, Graham wrote to Gruson, informing him that a delegation of the Riverside Planning Team would be delivering a petition to his office on June 1.
“We will deliver the petition on Monday and expect the response of the Corporation by 5 p.m. Wednesday, June 10,” she wrote. “At that time we will return for their answer.”
The petition demanded that Harvard construct low-income housing on the Treeland site, and that in the meantime, Harvard allocate 500 Peabody Terrace apartments to families threatened with eviction or struggling to pay rent. These demands, Graham wrote, “are essential if Harvard is to demonstrate that it has a commitment, beyond words, to rectify the damage done to the low income residents of Riverside by Harvard’s expansion.”
On June 10, members of the team did return, but received no answer from administrators. Determined to make their voices heard, they spent the night in the Yard and disrupted Commencement the next day. After their protest, administrators began to take Riverside activists more seriously.
Throughout the summer, the activists continued to leverage public attention to put pressure on the University, with Saundra Graham making appearances on TV and the radio. They raised another demand, too, telling administrators in a June meeting that they wanted veto power for any future development in the neighborhood.
Tempers rose on both sides. After hearing Graham planned to make another radio appearance, Gruson chided her in an August letter: “I thought that we agreed that it would be helpful for all of us to reduce the noise level surrounding this development,” he wrote.
“What a jerk,” Graham recalls. “It was like talking to a five-year-old.”
In a July 1970 letter, Gruson wrote to WKBG-TV to “correct errors” after Graham appeared on their air, insisting Riverside was a “mixed, complicated” neighborhood for which no one group could speak. Around the same time, he told Pusey that he worried the Riverside Planning Team would demonstrate outside his office. “I think their tactic is to try to pressure us during the course of the summer into some awkward position,” he wrote.
“I don’t think they were scared,” Graham remembers. “They just didn’t like the publicity.”
In the face of mounting public scrutiny, Harvard opted to strike a compromise. It would acquiesce to activist demands by locating space for affordable apartments, but would still develop Treeland into profitable student housing.
Though Gruson had previously complained that public pressure was making it harder for Harvard to find land for affordable housing, by July he assured Pusey in a letter that one piece of land he was eyeing “might be used for low and moderate income housing without a loss by the University.” Gruson looked at multiple sites, hoping to “covertly” secure them for low bids. A site at Howard and Western got the go-ahead, and Harvard purchased it.
“At long last,” Gruson wrote to Pusey in December 1970, “the Riverside people have agreed with us on a developer for the parcel of land at Howard Street and Western Avenue.” Harvard’s approach was softening: The University had moved from dismissing the activists’ framework to accepting at least some of their demands.
Harvard still planned to build on Treeland, even if Gruson expected “a fuss when we try to build for ourselves on that site,” he wrote in the same letter. Regardless, he swore he would “make it clear that the Treeland/Bindery site is NOT available for housing for the community.”
On March 1, 1971, Harvard voted to authorize the preparation of Treeland construction documents.
Still, continued pressure from activists, and the negative publicity it threatened to generate, pushed Harvard to bend even more toward resident demands.
In a September 1970 letter, Gruson updated the Riverside Planning Team on a recently acquired Harvard property that would focus on housing elderly low-income tenants. “The University wants to encourage the idea proposed by the Riverside Planning Team,” he wrote, referring to the team’s suggestions that tenants be chosen by the community and determine the building’s management policies.
On March 6, 1971, hundreds of Boston-area women took over 888 Memorial Drive, a building used for storage on the Treeland site, and refused to leave until Harvard committed to the creation of a women’s center and low-income housing on the property. The 10-day occupation garnered intense pushback from the administration amid increasing press coverage.
On March 15, a judge ordered police to arrest the women using “whatever force necessary and not listen to those do-gooders who say ‘police brutality’”; facing the prospect of violence and legal action, they left the day after. But they were able to use a $5,000 donation they had received during the occupation to put a down payment on what would later become the Cambridge Women’s Center — to this day, the longest continuously operating women’s center in the country.
By the end of the summer, the future of the Treeland site was far less certain than before.
Gruson wrote in August to Charles U. Daly, Harvard’s vice president for government and community affairs, to float the option of building mixed-income housing on the site. Even the low-income housing the University had built on River and Howard as a “quid pro quo,” he wrote, had not been enough to quell protests.
“During the last year we were never able to deflect the neighbors [sic] demands for at least part of the Treeland/Bindery site,” Gruson added, “probably because we were unwilling to take a stand and risk another disruption during Mr. Pusey’s last year.”
In September, Harvard worked to place tenants in some of its other affordable housing sites. They passed this responsibility to the Cambridge Corporation, a community development and housing organization, which told Harvard administrators it was working with Graham to reach “all possible eligible Black residents” of Riverside.
Later that month, William S. Gardiner, Harvard’s deputy director of buildings and grounds, wrote that the best strategy might be to use Treeland for something other than housing entirely. He added: “We should be able to defend the project on its own merit, by ourselves, or else we should consider some other more viable alternative.”
Two of those alternatives could be making it into a community center or a museum, Gardiner suggested. Another possible step that he hoped would be “less controversial” than the Riverside project was building across the river in Allston.
In October, the administration notified the Metropolitan District Commission that the University had scrapped its plans. It would not build on the Treeland site “for an indefinite time.”
Graham and the Planning Team were not surprised by the decision, but they only found out when Harvard students informed them of it. “Otherwise, we wouldn’t have known,” she says.
Daly released a report a year later announcing an 18-month moratorium on further land acquisition in Cambridge. For at least that much time, he wrote, “neither Harvard University nor its agents will purchase a single piece of residential property in Cambridge” outside a defined area that hewed closely to campus. Daly wrote that this decision was based on “moral commitment, enlightened self-interest and the knowledge that ... urban institutions neither can nor should live in isolation.”
Although the moratorium later expired, the University would not buy up Riverside properties in the same way again. In this part of Cambridge, Harvard’s era of expansion was effectively over.
Yvonne L. Gittens — a longtime Riverside resident and former director of the Cambridge Community Center, where she is affectionately known as Ms. G — gets several calls and texts a day. Pamphlets from real estate brokerages pour into her mailbox. Each asks if she’d sell her home — and for how much.
She sighs. “I don’t answer most of them. Today I got a text message, and instead of hitting delete, I hit redial. The guy called me back and I said: ‘Not interested.’”
“I often wonder how many of them are Harvard real estate or MIT real estate,” she adds.
In Riverside today, many buildings sport colorful siding and chic, sans-serif house numbers, bought up by enterprising developers. A handful of homes haven’t changed; they’ve been owned by the same families, many of them Black, for decades. But when properties are passed down and developers offer exorbitant amounts, some inheritors opt to sell.
After scrapping Treeland, true to Daly’s word, Harvard stopped the large-scale Cambridge land acquisition that marked the previous decades. But Riverside was still gentrified by private landlords and developers who pushed out working-class people to capitalize on the neighborhood’s proximity to Harvard.
In 1960, about 80 percent of rented properties in Riverside had a gross rent of less than $80, or $800 today. By 2000, that portion dropped to 26 percent. Until 1980, more than a third of Riverside residents were Black; now, only 18 percent are.
According to Reverend Dr. Jeremy D. Battle, the senior pastor at Western Avenue Baptist Church, many longtime Black residents have moved farther away, causing many of his former parishioners to go elsewhere instead.
“The expansion and development of Riverside,” he says, “was tantamount to the death of the Black church.”
Five years ago, at 8 p.m., police shut down a block party Graham was throwing; her neighbors had called the cops on her.
This is what her neighborhood looks like now, Graham says: new residents — many of them wealthy and white — who rarely show up to community meetings, who walk their dogs everywhere, who send their kids to private schools, who buy houses next to Corporal Burns Park and then complain about the teenagers playing basketball there, who call the cops on parties thrown by a woman in her 70s.
“It’s ludicrous,” she says. “What do they do for excitement?”
Gittens says that Riverside has filled up with people “who can afford to live in the suburbs.” She pauses for a moment and smiles: “Leave the city to us!”
When we ask Riverside residents to identify the time when the neighborhood first began to change, everyone says something different. Gittens traces change back to the 1960s, when the city widened Memorial Drive and connected Western Avenue to the Massachusetts Turnpike. Graham points to the ’80s, when she noticed white people starting to move in. Battle names the ’90s, when Massachusetts voters ended rent control policies that had been in place in Cambridge for decades; soon after, Harvard raised the rents of the 709 rent-regulated apartments it owned in the city.
Still, they all agree that Harvard, as one of the largest developers in the area, played an outsized role in reshaping it.
“Harvard was the major thing that has turned my community the way it is,” Graham says.
Many community members didn’t trust the University’s commitments to end development in the neighborhood. “They were just words,” Graham says. “You can’t trust people like that. They have no morals.”
In late 1998, Harvard announced that it hoped to turn the Treeland site, which by then held Mahoney’s Garden Center, into a modern art museum. Gardiner had recommended nearly 30 years earlier that such a move might be more acceptable than constructing University housing.
But Harvard was met with three years of resistance, during which residents convinced the City Council to place another moratorium on Riverside development. Some of them wanted the site to become a public park. At one meeting, The Crimson reported, a community member told the University: “If you build it, we’re going to bomb it.”
In 2002, the University gave up on its plans for the museum. In 2010, as part of an agreement between Harvard, Cambridge, and the Riverside neighborhood, the lot became a public park.
In recent years, Harvard has also invested in Boston-area affordable housing, such as the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative, which has put more than $40 million into the preservation and creation of affordable housing over the past two decades.
Harvard hasn’t tried to expand into Riverside for two decades — but in the neighborhood, bitter memories still linger.
Alex, a lifelong Riverside resident who wishes to be identified only by his first name, was born there in the ’80s. On a sunny afternoon, we stand on the sidewalk and talk about his home. “It’s a different community now,” he tells us. “Money came in and changed everything.”
He gestures toward the Peabody Terrace towers, visible from nearly every street in Riverside. “Harvard’s the big bad wolf around here,” he says. “They’ve got all the money, so they can push people out.”
Just across the river in Allston, Harvard owns more than one third of the land. Its 360 acres there hold the Business School, Science and Engineering Complex, hundreds of apartments, and perhaps someday, the 900,000-square-foot proposed Enterprise Research Campus. In some ways, its development strategy has been different from the widespread evictions and demolitions it pursued in Cambridge; in others, it has been markedly similar.
Kathy Spiegelman, Harvard’s associate vice president for planning and real estate, said in 1997 that “since most of the campus in Cambridge is surrounded by residential neighborhoods, and displacement of those neighborhoods is not in the university’s best interest or the realm of possibility, it was necessary to look in other places.” Harvard had started seriously acquiring land in Allston in 1989 under the moniker of the Beal Companies, a shell corporation, as they had done in Riverside decades prior.
Harvard has faced well-documented criticism over its push into Allston from residents who have raised concerns about rising housing prices and said the University has failed to transparently engage with locals.
“Harvard’s real planning is completely opaque,” says Brent Whelan ’73, a schoolteacher who has lived in Allston for decades. “What happens in public is something of a shadow game.”
As it had done in Riverside, Harvard has opted not to play the role of developer. Instead, it has contracted out private entities, which Whelan views as a move to insulate itself from accountability.
In contrast to its campaign in Riverside, in Allston, “Harvard has left residential structures intact as it expands into disused industrial space,” Whelan added in an email.
Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote in a statement that “the University is deeply engaged with and proud to be part of our vibrant communities in Cambridge, Boston, and throughout our region.”
She added: “We benefit immensely from collaborative work with residents, organizations, businesses, elected officials and others through programs, partnerships, public spaces and other shared activities and priorities. As we look ahead to Harvard’s future in Allston and elsewhere, we are committed to ongoing engagement with the community to advance shared goals, and to ensure that Harvard’s spaces and places are lively, welcoming, and inclusive, that they maintain and enhance the unique creative culture of their neighborhoods, and contribute to a thriving, innovative ecosystem.”
But residents still criticize Harvard’s impact on the housing market in Allston.
Whelan says, “Displacement is a subtle thing when you’re not coming in with a wrecking ball.”
***
During the Pusey era, Harvard espoused the idea that its real estate construction would benefit the economic outlook of all its neighbors.
In a 1959 address, Pusey defended Harvard properties’ tax-exempt status, saying: “Their very presence has a stabilizing effect on real estate values, since there is a constant market for houses and apartments.”
He was right; property values near Harvard remain some of the highest in the city to this day. But this idea erases the underbelly of the University-as-developer, and ignores that the large-scale eviction and demolition campaign it waged on Riverside was fundamentally necessary for its profits. To build Harvard facilities and dorms, or make nearby development more attractive, the University needed to cast families onto the street and demolish their homes.
The project that would have been Treeland came and went. Longtime residents aside — and there are few of them left — most people don’t remember what happened there. At least at first, Gruson’s correspondence suggests a University confident in this: that the people they are fighting have nothing important to say, or, anyway, no platform from which to say it.
But the residents who organized against the development knew that even if their homes were not directly under threat, the impact tremors it would have left on their neighborhood were too much to let pass. When Harvard pushed its vision of what Pusey called a “city within a city,” the city on the outside — just once, in this specific way — forced the University to listen.
Harvard, too, has moved on; the people it displaced didn’t have the choice.
At the end of our visit with Graham, we thank her for hosting us, looking at the family photos covering the walls as we turn to go. Outside, the leaves are starting to turn red.
“It’s been a long, long fight,” she says. “And if you don’t want to be in it for the long haul — don’t come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After reaching appointment wait times of up to six weeks in the spring, the Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services announced it will provide new and faster telehealth services to students Wednesday afternoon.
The new telehealth services — called TimelyCare — are made in partnership with TimelyMD, a Texas-based firm that aids universities in providing students with virtual care for mental health.
“There has been a growing need for student mental health support and resources and this partnership is an important part of meeting that need,” Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis wrote in an email announcement sent to University affiliates.
The TimelyCare platform, which is a regular offering from TimelyMD, will come at no extra cost to students. Any student currently enrolled in a degree program at the University and covered by the student health fee can use it, per the email from Lewis.
“Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) is committed to supporting the mental health and wellbeing of the University’s students by providing accessible, high-quality, and culturally sensitive mental health services,” Lewis wrote.
Lewis added that the mental wellbeing platform will not replace any existing CAMHS services, such as CAMHS Cares, the 24/7 support line, or group support and education sessions.
Students can access up to twelve scheduled counseling sessions per academic year for free through TimelyCare. They can also use the platform’s self-care content, which includes meditation sessions and group conversations with providers on various health-related topics.
This partnership with TimelyMD comes as Harvard is expanding its mental health and wellbeing resources in response to recommendations outlined in the 2020 final report by the task force on managing student mental health.
“The high utilization of CAMHS Cares reinforced to us the need to expand the delivery model for student mental health,” HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette. “This expansion of offerings, in adding telehealth supports, allows for flexibility in how a student responds to their mental health needs.”
In the same interview, Lewis said TimelyCare will provide “short-term, solution-focused therapy,” whereas the CAMHS Cares 24/7 line is for more rapid, “in-the-moment” care.
“In our experience, most moderate student mental health concerns can be addressed successfully in about six to eight sessions,” Nguyen said. “The fact that TimelyCare allows as many as 12 per year for each student is fantastic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dunster House Resident Dean Michael Uy arrived at the upperclassman house on his bike “Dragon” Saturday — after completing a 42-day, 13-state cross-country cycling trip.
The trip had been a long-term goal of Uy’s, though he had not previously been an avid cyclist. His work sabbatical this year provided him with the opportunity to bring the idea to fruition as his first long-distance cycling trip.
“It’s always been a dream of mine, almost a fantastical type of idea,” said Uy.
Uy left his parents’ house – and childhood home – in Orange County, California, on his birthday, Aug. 18. His parents, Abe and Julie, accompanied him for the first four days, providing extra rest stops as he traversed the mostly unpopulated Arizona desert.
The trip was physically and emotionally demanding, he said. He averaged between 80 and 100 miles each day across interstate highways and rocky trails, biking for up to twelve hours some days.
Family served as a big source of support for Uy on his journey, Uy said. His father even joined him by car for the second half of the journey.
“As I was saying goodbye to my dad on the fourth day — it was a really emotional day for me because it had been so challenging. He brought up this idea of possibly joining in Kansas City,” Uy said. “The nature of the trip changed and instead of just me biking across the country, it also became a father-son journey together.”
During the journey, Uy incorporated stops to visit friends in Cleveland, Ohio; his godson in Erie, Pennsylvania; and a Harvard alumnus in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
“I didn't realize how much it would mean to me to see him and to be with someone that I knew,” Uy said, referring to his visit in Albuquerque. “You come across a lot of strangers, but there's not quite that same familiarity or that comfort with seeing someone that you know. It was almost like he was kind of a guardian angel at the time.”
The trip did not come without its pitfalls. On various occasions, Uy was driven off the road by reckless drivers, he said.
“My main concerns before the trip were drivers, extreme weather, and injury. All of those things manifested at some point throughout the trip,” Uy said.
Though the trip was exceptionally difficult, he said, it proved to be rewarding and perspective-broadening as well.
“You do see so much more of those small towns than even if you were to drive through it,” Uy said. “You see the places that are thriving, you see the places that are not doing so well or have been abandoned and experiencing decline. That was all very eye-opening to me as I was going through the country.”
Asked about his takeaways from the trip, Uy said he was grateful that his yearslong dream was able to come true.
“If you have a goal, then prepare for it and do it, and then also be open to ways that the journey might change,” Uy said. “I'm incredibly grateful for having had that opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Senator Ronald L. Wyden (D-Ore.) discussed the challenges and opportunities of mental health and climate change legislation at a virtual event hosted by the Harvard School of Public Health on Wednesday afternoon.
Wyden was joined in conversation by moderator Krista Mahr, a health reporter with POLITICO. The talk was part of a series titled “View from the Hill” hosted by the HSPH.
During the talk, Wyden discussed how his brother impacted his views on America's health care system. Wyden’s younger brother struggled with schizophrenia — something Wyden said “had a huge impact” on his policy work.
“We would go to bed at night — week after week — worried that my brother would be on the streets and he was going to hurt himself, or someone else,” he said.
Wyden said he is concerned about the lack of mental health professionals to meet the “enormous need” of about 150 million people who live in mental health workforce shortage areas.
To remedy this, Wyden said he is exploring public-private partnerships to design mental health care solutions, citing the success of an Oregon-based public-private partnership between the University of Oregon and business magnates Steve and Connie Ballmer.
“They are launching a four-year program in Portland that can take a real bite out of the provider shortage because they’re giving us a model for training students in behavioral health,” he said. “I’m going to do everything I can to use this as a model for federal programs.”
Wyden said when young people are referred to mental health services, there is “virtually nobody” who follows through with them.
“That’s why we made a special effort in the gun safety bill on provisions like telehealth and the like,” he said. “Because of familiarity with digital, we think they’re likely to use those kinds of services."
In response to a question about insurers not treating mental health and physical health equally, Wyden said insurers have been “dragging their feet” in doling out payments for mental health insurance claims.
“I put out a press release — it was very small, it was in the Oregonian, a newspaper — saying I was going to open an investigation into all of this foot-dragging and excuse-mongering we were hearing from the insurance companies,” he said. “Within a few weeks, the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center got a gusher of payments from the insurance companies.”
Speaking on climate change, Wyden said President Joe Biden’s signing of the Inflation Reduction Act was “one of the best moments of [Wyden’s] time in public service.”
“We now will have a system built around clean energy, clean transportation, energy efficiency,” he said. “Between now and 2030, it’ll get us a long way to meeting the President’s carbon emission reductions targets.”
Wyden also said it is necessary to do more for fire prevention to minimize the health impacts of climate change.
“You sure see the impact of smoke wafting through your community,” Wyden said. “The smoke is a serious health concern. It’s dangerous to people’s lives and it takes a huge toll on mental health.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of about 20 Harvard Extension School students rallied in Harvard Yard on Sunday morning to call on the school to change the names of the degrees it offers.
The protest came one day after the Extension School hosted its first in-person Convocation ceremony since 2019.
Extension School students have called on Harvard for years to remove “in Extension Studies” from degrees offered by the school, saying the label does not accurately reflect students’ fields of study.
Rallygoers on Sunday held up signs saying “Remove in Extension Studies Now,” “We Stand with HES Students,” and “No One at Harvard Studies in Extension Studies.”
Degree-granting programs currently offered by the Extension School include a Bachelor of Liberal Arts and Master of Liberal Arts. Regardless of students’ fields of study, all graduates of the school receive degrees “in Extension Studies.”
Jennifer R. Nessle, a Bachelor’s degree candidate studying psychology at the Extension School, said changing the degree names would allow degrees from the school to command “dignity and respect.”
“Out in the world, we face discrimination for being a part of the Harvard Extension School,” she said. “I’ve personally had someone tell me to give up on my dreams because I don’t study at the ‘real Harvard.’”
“Our degrees should at least reflect the hard life-changing work that we have poured our blood, sweat, and tears into,” Nessle added.
The dean of Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education, Nancy Coleman, wrote in a statement that the DCE “will continue to explore the question of degree naming in appropriate governance venues.”
“We acknowledge that the degrees awarded through Harvard Extension School follow a naming convention that is dissimilar from those awarded by continuing education programs at peer institutions,” she wrote.
At the rally on Sunday, Robert E. Manning, a Master’s degree candidate studying international relations at the Extension School, said having “in Extension Studies” on the degrees hampers students’ job prospects.
“The purpose of the rally was to have ‘in Extension Studies’ removed from our degree so that we could have an equal degree with the rest of Harvard,” he said.
Kody Christiansen, president of the Harvard Extension Student Association, said he is working to get a statement of support for the degree name change from the Harvard Undergraduate Association.
“I think we need our administration and our fellow students and our professors to speak up,” Christiansen said.
Former Division of Continuing Education Dean Huntington D. Lambert expressed support for the degree name change prior to his departure, saying in 2019 he had raised the issue with the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board.
The 2021 student satisfaction survey report, published by the DCE in June, indicated that many respondents were concerned about the degree name.
In response to the survey, Coleman wrote in a statement posted on the DCE’s website that she wants “to ensure that we have a degree name that is academically correct and accurately represents the interdisciplinary learning as well as high academic achievement of our post-traditional degree candidates.”
“As a unique entity within Harvard, our degree name must be distinctive, yet recognizable to future employers and in line with our peer institutions,” she said in the statement. “A degree name is a once-in-a-century decision. The request must be fully informed with eye toward the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan outlined a potential path to the White House for a moderate Republican candidate in 2024 at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Wednesday — but offered little insight into his own political ambitions.
Hogan’s appearance at the IOP comes as he is reportedly weighing a run for president. Earlier this week, the news outlet Maryland Matters reported that Hogan recently met with a group of supporters to discuss a potential White House bid and he has made appearances in New Hampshire, an early primary state.
Hogan, who will leave office in January after two terms, said the primary process “does not favor people that are willing to work together across the aisle,” but said a centrist candidate could still have a path in a crowded GOP field.
“If you have 10 or 12 people all running in the Trump lane, there is certainly a lane of close to 30 percent of people that want to go in a different direction in a Republican primary,” he said.
Hogan, who described himself as “a common sense conservative” and did not support former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, was not asked whether he plans to run in 2024.
Hogan noted that many of the early primary states have open primaries, which allow voters to pick which primary they vote in, regardless of registration.
“If people were so motivated — they were frustrated enough with where we were as a country — and said, ‘we want to vote for something different,’ it could totally upset the apple cart,” he said.
The forum was moderated by IOP fellow Matthew H. Mead, who served as governor of Wyoming from 2011 to 2019.
Hogan also discussed political extremism and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which he called a “terrible assault on democracy.”
“Our democracy is at stake,” he said. “I’m going to stand up, whether my fellow Republicans like it or not. I’m going to tell it like it is.”
Hogan recounted the story of Jan. 6, 2021, when he sought to mobilize the Maryland National Guard, but was delayed because he lacked authorization from the Department of Defense.
“It’s crazy to me that we’re still at that point, where that many people are still denying the election and think it was okay to try to overturn the results of an election,” he said.
Hogan was asked by Eric Evans, a fellow at the Kennedy School who attended the event, about the prospects of third parties, like the recently founded Forward Party.
Hogan acknowledged the “70 percent of people frustrated with both parties,” but, he said, “we’d be better off trying to fix the broken parties.”
He also discussed his ascent to the governor’s mansion in Maryland and undergoing cancer treatment during his term.
“I really don’t care about the politics,” he said. “I think it’s why I’ve been successful in Maryland — because I haven’t cared about politics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two of its three out-of-conference tuneups out of the way, crunch time is quickly approaching for Harvard football (2-1, 1-0). Since the Ivy League opts not to participate in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) playoffs, the seven regular-season contests are the sole determinant of conference glory, so from here on out, nearly every snap will matter. The gauntlet will begin on Friday night, when the Crimson will play its second Ivy League matchup of the season, a 7 p.m. clash in Ithaca, N.Y., against Cornell (2-1, 0-1).
“We understand that without having a playoff … every Ivy League game matters a lot,” said senior defensive lineman Truman Jones, who was selected by his teammates to serve as the 148th Captain of Harvard Football this season. “This is that point in the season where it’s time to buckle down and all the work that we’ve put in in the preseason and these earlier out-of-conference games will come to fruition.”
After defeating the Big Red last year, 24-10, at Harvard Stadium, Harvard will have its hands full on Friday night against a Cornell team led by an ascendant quarterback, sophomore Jameson Wang, who had a breakout game in his last appearance, a 34-31 victory over Colgate last weekend. Wang led the Big Red on a go-ahead field goal drive with under two minutes remaining, and the Cornell defense would hold the Raiders on their ensuing drive to ensure the victory. Overall, Wang put up 284 passing yards and added another 98 yards and two scores on the ground. But thankfully for the Crimson, it has recent experience with a dual-threat quarterback of Wang’s caliber.
Harvard will travel to Ithaca on the heels of its first loss of the season, a tight battle against Holy Cross in which Crusaders quarterback Matthew Sluka burned the Crimson for 300 yards through the air and 63 on the ground. The team was unable to generate any offense in the fourth quarter despite a strong game overall from senior running back Aidan Borguet, who garnered 80 yards and two scores on his 18 carries, and senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly, who fell just short of the century mark in receiving yards, finishing with 9 catches for 99 yards and a score. After playing clean football at Brown the week before, the Crimson lost two fumbles and had a punt blocked against Holy Cross, mishaps that thwarted a potential comeback.
If Harvard hopes to bounce back and hand the Big Red its second conference loss in as many games, it will have to rely largely on the strength of its front seven, which forms the core of its stellar rushing defense. In 2021, the Crimson allowed just 64.6 rushing yards per game, which was enough to pace the nation. So far this season, it is off to a strong start again, ranking fourth nationally with 76.7, even after allowing the Crusaders to put up 147 yards on the ground. In addition to a sturdy linebacker corps, led by senior Jack McGowan, Harvard’s rushing defense features junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith, who has 21 tackles through three games, including 4.5 for a loss, and two sacks. A lot of credit for the elite unit is due to defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99, who consistently emphasizes fundamentals.
“For [the defensive line] specifically, it’s hand placement and how we attack the offensive linemen, as well as getting off those blocks, so shedding techniques, and playing really sound gaps,” Jones explained.
As a run-heavy game would play to the Crimson’s strengths, Jones said he and his unit hope to force Wang out of the pocket on his dropbacks. But with a stellar pass rush, Wang will not have it easy if he chooses to take to the air against Harvard. Senior defensive lineman Nate Leskovec, after putting up a monster performance in the season-opening win over Merrimack with 4.5 sacks, leads the nation in sacks per game (1.50). As a unit, Harvard also ranks second in the country with 4.67 sacks per contest, as Leskovec’s efforts are supplemented by playmakers like Griffith and Jones, who recorded a crucial takedown of Sluka near the end of the first half against Holy Cross.
The pass rush unit is a big reason why, despite recording just one interception in the first three games of the year, the Crimson ranks a respectable 44th nationally in Team Passing Efficiency Defense (129.86). The secondary is led by veterans, as both starting cornerbacks – Alex Washington and Khalil Dawsey – are seniors, as is safety James Herring, who led the team in tackles against the Crusaders with ten. Last week, the Harvard secondary struggled with pass interference penalties, with each of McGowan, Dawsey, and Washington getting flagged once. It will have to be better against a Cornell offense that boasts arguably the best receiver in the Ancient Eight.
While Harvard may aim to flush Wang out of the pocket, the Harvard-Westlake (Studio City, Calif.) product surely hopes to keep the chains moving through the air. In Ithaca, Wang was reunited with one of his top targets from high school, senior wide receiver Thomas Glover, who connected with Wang for 677 yards and eight touchdowns at Harvard-Westlake in 2017. Although he was the No. 2 target for the Wolverines, he enjoyed a breakout campaign last year for the Big Red, as the converted running back led the Ivy League with 767 receiving yards. Glover is off to a stellar start again in 2022, as he hauled in seven passes for 160 yards and a touchdown against the Raiders.
“Get a pass rush, to make those throws uncomfortable, make the ball sail high,” said Jones of the keys to containing Glover. “And for cornerbacks and the rest of the defense is to run fast, play good with our eyes, and lock into our techniques and fundamentals.”
In addition to Glover, Wang will be able to target junior tight end Matt Robbert, junior wide receiver Nicholas Laboy, who brought in a touchdown against Yale on Sept. 24, and senior tight end William Enneking, who found the end zone twice against the Virginia Military Institute. The Cornell rushing offense starts with Wang, who has taken his 36 carries for 194 yards and two scores, but also features running backs Eddy Tillman and Gannon Carothers, who have combined for 199 yards and one touchdown. Head coach David Archer will hope to get his playmakers involved in creative ways on Friday night, a staple of Big Red offenses under his tutelage.
“They do well in terms of disguising their plays with different formations,” Jones explained. “It’s a lot of similar plays with a variety of formations, so there’s not a lot to key on specifically with that.”
The Crimson offense, led by senior quarterback Charlie Dean, will look to find success against a Big Red defense that has struggled to get to the quarterback early on in the season. After registering six sacks in its season-opening win over the Virginia Military Institute, Cornell failed to record a single sack in its past two contests against Yale and Colgate. Another potential opening that the Crimson will look to exploit is the Big Red rush defense: Yale and Colgate combined to rush the ball a total of 61 times against Cornell at an average clip of 4.0 and 7.2 yards per carry, respectively. With Borguet averaging 6.3 yards per carry and standing seventh in the country with 112.7 rushing yards per game, Harvard fans can expect to see a lot of the senior on Friday night.
“They always play us well,” said Dean of the Big Red, which will be playing in its second home game of the season. “It’ll be up to us to decipher what the fronts are, what the blitzes are, what the covers are at the line so we can execute our offense to them the best we can.”
Dean will look to continue his strong start to the season, in which he has completed 58 percent of his passes and tossed six touchdowns, with his only two interceptions coming in the first game against Merrimack. In addition to his special connection with Wimberly, the senior from Odessa, Fla. has also gotten the best out of sophomore wide receiver and deep threat Ledger Hatch, who reeled in a 55-yard deep ball against Holy Cross and an 81-yard touchdown catch the week before against Brown. If Hatch is able to get behind the Cornell secondary, the Crimson will be able to recreate its winning formula it used this year against Brown and last year against the Big Red, when running back B.J. Watson ‘22 gashed the defense for an 81-yard touchdown catch.
Finding a way to beat the Cornell secondary will be no easy task, though. The hosts will be led by a pair of big safeties, six-foot-four sophomore Trey Harris, whose older brother Will plays safety for the Detroit Lions, and six-foot-two fifth-year Demetrius Harris. Trey Harris led the team in tackles in the win over Colgate, and Demetrius Harris finished second. Demetrius Harris also recorded an interception in the win over the Virginia Military Institute, one of three so far this season for the Big Red. Junior linebacker Holt Fletcher leads the team in picks, having recorded one each against VMI and Colgate. The Cornell defensive front also features senior linebacker Jake Stebbins, a two-time All-Ivy selection who recovered a fumble against VMI. Stebbins led the Ivy League with 95 total tackles in 2021. Between the two Harrises, Fletcher, and Stebbins, the Big Red have the size and athleticism to pose problems for the high-powered Harvard attack.
On Friday night, Cornell will hope to prove that it has what it takes to pull off the upset. It will be aided by a travel advantage, for the journey to Ithaca marks the Crimson’s second-longest of the year. On the six hour, thirty-minute bus ride to the Finger Lakes region, Harvard players will hope to keep their bodies loose for what promises to be a bruising, physical battle against an unrelenting conference opponent.
“We’ll stretch out into the aisles and watch film and focus and really lock into our game plan as well,” Jones said of the bus ride.
After the long journey, the Crimson and the Big Red will clash under the lights at Schoellkopf Field. The teams will be under the spotlight metaphorically as well, as it will be the first of four nationally-televised games that Harvard will play this season, the most of any Ivy League school. Harvard fans can tune in to the game on ESPNU or follow along over the air on WRCA at 1330 AM, 106.1 FM, or 92.9 FM-HD2.

Midterms. Once they start, they literally never end. You wake up on an otherwise ordinary day in September to start studying for your first midterm and then you never stop until your last “miDteRM”— which is most likely a week before your first final. Of all the things that suck about academically rigorous work at an academically rigorous school, midterms take the cake for being the absolute worst part of it. Here are my main qualms with midterms at Harvard:
They’re Never in the Middle of the Semester.
In fact, my first “midterm” this semester was during the second week of school. Dear Dean K, who decided that the middle of the term was the beginning of September? Midterms in September should be banned — I’m still figuring out how to get to all my classes and eat three meals a day. Or at least two. And sleep eight hours. And socialize. Spoiler Alert: I’m not entirely sure if I'll ever figure that out.
They Somehow All End Up On the Same Day.
Even though they’re spread out from Mid-September to Mid-December, all your midterms somehow end up being on the same day. I’m looking at you MCB 60, Chem 17, and potentially Psych 1. Thank you for stealing all my friends on the dreaded last Wednesday of September.
You Can’t Make Plans With Friends. 
With midterms spread throughout the semester for every class, there’s nothing you and your friend’s excellent g-cal skills can do for anyone. At least one person will have an exam the week that you all want to grab dinner, go to a party, or finally explore what’s out of the Harvard Bubble.
And then there’s still MORE work.
Professors still think it's a good idea to assign psets, lab reports, essays and weekly Canvas discussion posts for the very same class you have an upcoming midterm for. Incoming petition to give us a break: loading…
Their Existence. 
Deep down, I know we all know that midterms might somehow, maybe, kind of, ish, serve a purpose (potentially?), but it doesn’t change the fact that the biggest ick of them all is that they exist in the first place. How dare you evaluate my knowledge of a subject I signed up to learn and master. Ridiculous.
All jokes aside — we’re wishing you all the best on your midterms during this never-ending exam season! Exams or no exams, the future is looking up because it's also Spooky Season → Thanksgiving → Harvard-Yale → Winter holiday season!
