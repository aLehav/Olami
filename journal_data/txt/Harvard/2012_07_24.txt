After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EdX, the free not-for-profit online learning venture co-founded by Harvard and MIT, will be adding a third university to the mix after EdX announced the addition of the University of California, Berkeley on Tuesday.
UC Berkeley, ranked by US News & World Report as the best public school in the nation, will offer two courses—both from the computer science department—to supplement the five pre-existing offerings, two from Harvard and three from MIT.
"We are very excited that Berkeley is coming on board,” said Anant Agarwal, President of EdX. “We share with Berkeley a common vision for non-profit learning worldwide. We have seen grass roots energy at the Professor and leadership levels of all three universities.”
Berkeley will also serve as the inaugural chair of the soon-to-be-formed “X University” Consortium, while bringing with it open source technology developed in a variety of on-campus online ventures that should enhance the online experience.
EdX was launched in May after MIT and Harvard each pledged $30 million in support to the venture which promises to expand access to education by providing a forum for students to learn from world-class professors. The prototype course of EdX, MITx's 6.002x Circuits & Electronics, was offered in December.
More than 150,000 students registered online.
“The way I think of it is that to this generation, it is equivalent to what back in the old days the opening of the public library was,” said Marcello Pagano, Professor of Statistical Computing at the Harvard School of Public Health. “It’s allowing anyone with a computer to come to our library and access any book in the world.”
Pagano will be co-teaching PH207x: Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical & Public Health Research, one of the two HarvardX courses, in the fall.
EdX had planned to expand beyond the original two universities from the beginning, but the addition of Berkeley is noteworthy for coming just a week after a competing platform, Coursera, announced an expanded roster of 16 top-tier universities.
A number of Berkeley professors had been using Coursera, a for-profit venture founded by two Stanford professors, prior to the EdX announcement.
“All of our faculty in the end can do whatever they want to do,” said Robert J. Birgeneau, the Chancellor of UC Berkeley. "It's up to them whether or not they want to continue using Coursera."
Despite the potential conflicting interests Birgeneau pledged his support behind EdX.
“We are committed to excellence in online education with the dual goals of distributing higher education more broadly and enriching the quality of campus-based education,” Birgeneau announced in a statement. “We share the vision of MIT and Harvard leadership and believe that collaborating with the not-for-profit model of edX is the best way to do this."
CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science I will be the other HarvardX offering. Both HarvardX courses begin on October 15. The two Berkeley offerings, CS191.1x Software as a Service and CS188.1x Artificial Intelligence, are both higher level computer science courses.
For the time being all EdX courses will be offered for free. But as EdX expands and looks to become sustainable, one way in which revenue will be generated will be through the certificate of mastery program. In the prototype course, over 7,000 enrollees opted for the certificate.
“As far as the fee, we haven’t figured it out,” Agarwal said. “But it will be part of our sustainability model. It will be on the order of $100, similar to that of a textbook. All the courses will offer certificates in the fall for free, but beyond that we will have to reassess.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Stadium’s reign as the tallest structure on the block may soon come to an end.
At the Harvard-Allston Task Force Meeting on Monday night, an architect laid out plans for a six-story mixed-use building—about 300 residential units above ground-level retail outlets—that would stand higher than the iconic birthplace of modern football, less than a thousand feet away.
“We are thinking about open space that blurs the line between public realm and private enterprise so you are expanding the sense of public ground,” said David P. Manfredi of Elkus Manfredi Architects as he presented a tentative plan for the Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons project planned on Harvard-owned land in Allston. “We want ground floor space that spills out, storefronts that are open-able and operable.”
For comparison, Manfredi mentioned the Charles Square area on the Cambridge side of the Charles River, which hosts Legal Sea Foods in the summer and an ice rink in the winter.
The Barry’s Corner Commons project would arise on a lot at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, adjacent to Harvard’s McCurdy Track. The land is currently occupied by a parking lot and the semi-underground Harvard Ceramics Program building.
The proposal met mixed reviews from neighbors at the meeting. Several liked the idea of creating an “urban village center” and potentially creating space for a farmer’s market.
When the same land parcel was discussed in 2006, a hockey rink was on the table, but nothing of that size was mentioned this time around. But members of the audience voiced some of the same concerns as six years ago, focusing mostly on parking and safe traffic flow.
One member of the audience said that parking was hard to find as is and that he was worried it would only get harder after development. The current proposal includes two levels of parking to accommodate consumers and residents.
Other residents expressed worries about the potential ramifications of putting a large development at an already-complicated intersection. “I think they have a major safety problem with traffic that conceivably could create a lot of traffic problems stretching all the way down North Harvard [Street] and Western [Ave.],” Allston resident Ed A. Kotomori said at the meeting.
Some worried that due to the growth of online retail, the complex cannot support the suggested amount of storefronts. They suggested that more housing be included instead. But others thought the plan already called for too many housing units packed into too small a space.
“I have a real problem with the density of the project,” Task Force member Cathi Campbell said at the meeting. “There’s been a lot of pushback with the density people are seeing with the Charlesview project. I can’t go back to my neighbors and say I’m supporting something that’s of a larger scale.”
In response to concerns about retail, Joel Sklar of Samuels & Associates, a consulting firm brought in by Harvard two weeks ago solely for this property, said that “retail” should be defined broadly. The center will likely include a mix of establishments including entertainment and cultural venues, he said.
Kotomori and others also clamored to know more about the fate of the lot across the street, site of the soon-to-be-relocated Charlesview public housing project, which Harvard now also owns.
“The other thing bothering me is the unknown,” Kotomori said. “I think when all the neighbors here think about Barry’s Corner, we’ve got to look at the whole picture.”
In response, Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey said that at the next Task Force meeting, on Aug. 8, the University will discuss how Barry’s Corner fits into its broader master plan for Allston construction. He said the University will announce specific plans for the Charlesview site, which it has designated only for “institutional use,” when residents move into the new site in 2013.

CLARIFICATION: July 25
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article said Harvard Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey planned to discuss the University's use of the Charlesview apartment complex site at the upcoming Harvard-Allston Task Force Meeting on Aug. 8. Casey said that the University would discuss its master plan for its properties in Allston, not just the Charlesview lot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It didn’t take long for Will Newell ’11 to go from novice to Olympic-caliber rower.
“Will didn’t start rowing until his junior year in high school,” said Linda Muri, Harvard’s lightweight freshman coach. “He had very good recommendations from his high school coach, but he was a little bit of a wild card.”
After coming to Harvard, Newell developed quickly, earning himself the lightweight captaincy as a senior and leading the Crimson to a combined 27-1 during his time on the 1V. A victory at Eastern Sprints and a second-place finish at IRA nationals, along with a stint on the Under-23 National team in 2010, convinced Newell to consider international rowing despite his short career.
Just six years after the start of his rowing career, the Weston, Mass., native will be representing the United States in London as a member of the lightweight four, which starts competition on Saturday. In doing so, Newell will become just the fifth Crimson lightweight rower to compete in the Olympic Games.
“I really fell in love with the sport, and I could definitely see me sticking with this for a while,” Newell said.
CHANGING THE COURSE
Harvard has a long tradition of success in the lightweight, capturing its eighth national championship last season, but its rowers have not been able to match that success on the Olympic level. Since the lightweight four was added as an event to Olympic competition in 1996, the USA has only walked away with one medal, a bronze in the Atlanta Games during those inaugural Olympic competitions. The team failed to come close in Sydney, Athens, or Beijing.
“The overarching goal is to kind of turn that around,” Newell said of the USA’s relative failure in the four. “Over the past four years, the lightweight fours internationally have been incredibly close. That means that there’s not a lot of room for error, so if we can make it to the A final, anything can happen.”
The route to the Olympics for Newell and his three fellow oarsmen was stressful. After narrowly missing a qualifying spot at the Games at the 2011 World Rowing Championships, Newell and company had to wait a year to earn their way into the Games with a first-place finish at the 2012 Final Olympic Qualification Regatta.
“It’s been such an emotional rollercoaster ever since the qualification,” Newell said. “To go from not even knowing if you’re going to have the chance to qualify to definitely going was incredible.”
Joining Newell on the fastest lightweight four US Rowing could put together are three familiar faces—every member of the boat rowed in Ivy League competition. Anthony Fahden, a 2008 Dartmouth grad and the “veteran” of the group, is the only one that Newell did not compete against or with at any level prior to joining the lightweight four.
Robin Prendes rowed for Princeton in the same year as Newell, going head-to-head with Newell for four years before joining forces this summer. Nick Lacava, a 2009 Columbia graduate, rounds out the boat.
“We were deemed the fastest US four they could put together,” Newell said. "A lot of the lightweight rowers come out of Ivy League schools, and we just happened to all earn a spot on the same boat.”
OKLAHOMA, WHERE THE BOAT COMES SWEEPING DOWN THE WATER
Unlike most of the crews which choose to train in traditional locales such as the Northeast and California, US Rowing put rowers competing for a spot on the lightweight four away from the sports’ classic centers: Oklahoma City.
A major factor in that choice was the influence of Devon Energy, an Oklahoma City-based Fortune 500 natural gas and oil company that reported $4.1 billion in profits in Fiscal Year 2011. A community effort driven by the Oklahoma City University, endeavored to build a world class rowing facility to attract Olympic hopefuls to Oklahoma City. Part of the effort was the construction of Devon Boathouse.
"OKC loves its sports and      loves its athletes," said Frank Rudolph, Devon's Executive Vice President of Human Resources. "When we built the facility to attract these Olympians it      was a really nice fit."
Devon Energy has provided a number of rowers, including Newell who works in the Marketing Solutions department, with jobs to support themselves as they train for international competition. The company prides itself on allowing for as much flexibility as necessary to accomodate the training schedule necessary to pursue their Olympic dreams.
“There’s a lot of community support here,” Newell said. “Devon Energy has put a lot of money into the program. If you row, you need equipment, water, a place in the community to live and jobs. OKC has done a great job providing that for us.”
After training year round in Oklahoma City, eight rowers went out to California for the national team camp. Through a series of complex assessment criteria, lightweight four coach Bryan Volpenhein and the rest of US Rowing settled on the grouping that would represent the United States at the World Championships and, after qualifying, the Olympics.
“The benefit of training together for so long is that you have tons of data,” Newell said. “You had to look at that, figure out what it said, and pare it down in order to put together the best possible boat.”
OLYMPIC CHANCES
As Newell noted, the lightweight four is one of the more competitive events on the docket during the eight day rowing competition. The defending champion Danes return a strong boat that should contend for gold. Denmark has won three of the four Gold medals in the event, but the last two World Championships were won by Italy and Great Britain.
It would take a formidable effort for the United States to break its Olympic medal drought.
“If things go well for us in the opening qualifiers, I’m optimistic that we can make something happen,” Newell said.
Just one year out of college, Newell has already outpaced the expectations of his coaches and himself. Earning a spot on the US Olympic team makes Newell, 23, the second youngest former Crimson athlete competing in these Games—only British women’s basketball player Temi Fagbenle ’15 is younger. Newell’s development over such a short period on the water hints at better things to come.
“Committing to rowing out of college is kind of putting your life on hold for a bit,” Newell said. “But for the people who have the dedication that want to do this, and know that they’ll have other opportunities after their done, there could not be anything more rewarding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A league-high 16 Harvard football players were named to the College Sports Madness Preseason All-Ivy Team, headlined by pre-season All-American tight ends senior Kyle Juszczyk and junior Cameron Brate and sophomore wideout/return-man Seitu Smith.
There was an even eight-eight split between the offense and the defense, and coach Tim Murphy was named the preseason Coach of the Year.
Juszczyk and Smith are joined by senior center Jack Holuba on the first team, while Brate, senior running back Treavor Scales, and sophomore offensive tackle Will Whitman landed on the second team. Rounding out the offensive honors on the third team were sophomore running back Zach Boden and offensive lineman Austin Scheufele.
On the defensive side, the line seems to have survived the loss of Ivy League Player of the Year Josue Ortiz ’11, as seniors John Lyon and Nnamdi Obukwelu landed two of the first team’s four spots. Seniors Alex Norman, Brian Owusu, and Jacob Dombrowski also made the first team, at linebacker, cornerback, and punter, respectively.
Sophomore defensive lineman Zach Hodges made the second team, with line-mate junior Jack Dittmer filling out the D-line on the third team. Junior linebacker Joshua Boyd also made the third team, joined by incoming freshman linebacker Dayne Davis.
