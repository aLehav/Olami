After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School has laid off 18 employees to help it close a $2 million budget gap that persisted after less drastic spending cuts, Dean David T. Ellwood '75 announced in a letter to the School's faculty and staff last Tuesday.
"[The] budget challenges caused by the decline in the endowment payout have forced us to take this action," Ellwood wrote, noting that a projected 20 percent reduction in the payout over the next two years, combined with other revenue declines, created a $9 million shortfall in the School's budget.
University officials had originally stated in March that the payout would decrease by 8 percent this coming year and by at least the same amount the following year. Spokesman John D. Longbrake said they have since revised their guidance to suggest a 12 percent decrease for fiscal year 2011, which begins a year from this July.
Ellwood said that the School has frozen salaries for faculty and exempt staff, implemented a "hiring frost," reduced the faculty budget, and trimmed expenses for travel, food, rent, and outside services. But a roughly $2 million "long-term structural gap" remained, he said, forcing the School to cut staff.
HKS spokeswoman Melodie Jackson said that while faculty and staff hiring has been roughly flat at HKS over the past five years, compensation and benefits still make up 59 percent of the School's operating budget. Prior to last week's layoffs, 498 staff worked at HKS, she said.
To cut other non-personnel costs, the Kennedy School has also indefinitely postponed many of its capital projects, sought new sources of revenue through donors and research grants, and participated in the University's voluntary early retirement incentive program, Ellwood wrote in his e-mail.
According to a recent University human resources report, 19 staff members out of 59 eligible employees accepted buyout packages at HKS. University spokesman Kevin Galvin has said in the past that the average participant in the University's buyout program had an annual salary of $67,000 and that the reductions were split half-and-half between hourly employees and administrative and professional staff.
As a result of these cost-cutting measures and the recent layoffs, "we believe our long-term budget is now sound," Ellwood wrote. He added that "barring any unexpected developments" and excluding normal staff attrition, he does not anticipate the need for further School-wide layoffs.
In 2008, the Kennedy School drew a quarter of its operating budget from its endowment—roughly the same fraction seen at the Medical School but only half of that seen at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As of June 30 last year, the Kennedy School's endowment stood at $1.1 billion, although University administrators have for months projected a 30 percent decline in Harvard's total endowment over the course of this fiscal year. Current use gifts compose another 20 percent of the Kennedy School's budget—the largest amount at all of Harvard's schools, with the Law School next highest at 12 percent.
While Ellwood wrote that "this is certainly the most heart-wrenching period our close-knit community has faced in many years," similar budgetary turmoil plagued the Kennedy School earlier in the decade and prompted staff reductions then as well.
In 2002, the Kennedy School eliminated 30 administrative positions and 17 adjunct faculty positions, half through staff attrition and half through direct layoffs, to help close a $5.6 million deficit exposed during the bear market.
HKS had increased its number of faculty positions in the late 1990s and early 2000s by almost 40 percent, and new programs such as the Center for Public Leadership and the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy were launched largely through deficit spending. These initiatives had been paid for during economic booms by the growing endowment, but when the national economy slumped early in the decade, the expenditures coalesced into a deficit and forced HKS officials to take steps to eliminate the budget gap. Overhead costs, for everything from electricity bills to equipment, were furthermore magnified by the School's expansion.
By slashing its full-time faculty by 11 percent over two years, hiking tuition, stepping up fundraising efforts, and slicing administrative budgets by 5 to 15 percent, HKS managed to dramatically eliminate its deficit in a short amount of time. By 2004, the School had achieved a $1.1 million surplus, and in 2005, it recorded a $3.6 million surplus. 
In his letter, Ellwood emphasized that the University would "do everything possible to help and support those who are laid off" by providing 60 days of full pay and benefits, other severance benefits, continued medical and dental benefits for a year and a half, and job placement support. He also noted that HKS would "pay special attention" to those affected by layoffs in filling new job positions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University officials are continuing to cut Harvard's subcontracted janitorial staff despite a string of protests in Cambridge and at the Medical School campus this past spring, according to union organizers.
Acme Pioneer Building Services, which provides roughly 40 cleaners at various locations throughout Harvard's Cambridge campus, is planning on laying off the equivalent of four full-time employees at the Harvard Kennedy School, according to Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for the Service Employees International Union Local 615. Daniel B. Becker, an SEIU organizer working with Langley, said that while the cuts have not been fully finalized, the reductions were slated to happen on July 1 and some workers may have already been notified.
Becker also said that the union learned on Tuesday morning that 10 workers at Harvard Business School, subcontracted from UGL Unicco, are scheduled to be laid off on July 13. He said that the workers were notified of the cuts on Monday, but that the Union had not been consulted beforehand.
Unicco is also planning on laying off one part-time worker at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study while cutting work hours by 8 percent for the other 12 employees there, Becker said. He emphasized that the union is still engaged in discussions with the subcontractor about the downsizing.
University spokesman Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the latest staff reductions. But Harvard officials have long cited the slumping endowment as a reason to trim compensation costs, which make up roughly half of Harvard's operating budget.
Langley said that the University's decentralized decision-making and budget-planning process have made it difficult for the union to gather concrete information about the reductions. He also warned that similar cuts to subcontracted workers will likely continue through the summer and the next fiscal year.
Earlier this spring, a number of subcontracted janitors were laid off at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Real Estate Services, prompting student protests and even a vigil for the workers. American Cleaning Company laid off 11 employees but then rehired two at HMS, and OneSource laid off seven at properties administered by HRES, Langley said. He added that due to a contract swap and reduction, Unicco also lost two employees at HRES.
While the University does not directly dictate how many workers need to be laid off at the various sites, it has asked subcontractors to cut costs by 30 to 40 percent, which have translated into staff reductions. Langley said that he does not know of any reductions made to Harvard's directly-hired cleaning staff.
Langley said he believes that Harvard has failed to provide adequate and detailed financial information to justify the cuts, and that it is debatable whether the janitorial staff reductions are necessary or effective. As such, he said, "we feel Harvard has the resources not to do any layoffs [and] there's been a choice made here, to punish loyal, hardworking employees and to keep the endowment."
Furthermore, he said, when SEIU organizers meet with human resource and academic administrators, Harvard officials are uninformed and fail to communicate openly about their specific cost-cutting needs and goals. He said that the union routinely asks Harvard how many staff will be cut and how the University plans to accomplish the same workload with fewer staff, but each time the response has been unclear and unsatisfactory.
"The University says they're willing to meet at any time, but it's an illusion," he said. "Then they ask, 'What do we mean?' I say, 'They don't answer the questions.' There's been this cone of silence over the whole problem."
John DeLuca, president of Acme Pioneer, declined to comment on the discussions with Harvard. But he emphasized that Acme is a service company dedicated to meeting its customers' needs, and he noted that beyond ensuring that the cuts are made according to seniority, the Union has little real say in the cost-cutting process.
"If Harvard says we're going to cut these services, it's what you do," DeLuca said. "[The union] has nothing to say about the cuts. If you're running a business and you want to cut somebody, you don't have to ask the union's permission. That's the way America runs."
Representatives from Unicco could not be reached for comment on the layoffs.
Langley said he is concerned that there is a "passivity" in the Harvard community about the recent University-wide staff layoffs, as well as the janitorial cuts. But he insisted that "despite what people say, [the cuts] will have an impact on the academic quality of the institution."
"We continue to insist that there's no need for layoffs at this time, and that's our position," he said. "In prior recessions, if you got laid off, you could find a job, although maybe not the best job...[it's] a whole different ball game now. This is like life or death stuff, and I'm being completely honest. We see the consequences of people losing houses and healthcare when they can't find work, and we've seen this in our own union."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is changing its subcontractor for campus security from AlliedBarton to Securitas on Aug. 1, but the workers employed, the level of security on campus, and the collective bargaining agreement between the workers and the union will not change.
"We expect [all the workers] to be rehired by Securitas...that's our demand," said Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for Service Employees International Union Local 615. "We think that pretty much all aspects of contract under AlliedBarton will be honored by Securitas."
The contract switch marks the end of a tumultuous five-year stint for AlliedBarton at Harvard that saw student protests and even a hunger strike erupt as security guards fought for wage increases and the right to unionize. Although security guards had once been directly employed by the University and enjoyed membership in the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union, the University gradually outsourced the work due to financial losses earlier in the decade.
University spokesman Kevin Galvin declined to comment on whether the University is reducing costs with the contractor switch, saying only that the move resulted from a "competitive bidding process in which Securitas presented the most competitive proposal." He said that the Securitas contract will last for three years with an option to renew for up to an additional three years.
At a time already tense with the news of layoffs and budget-cutting, it appears that Harvard sought to avoid any possible conflict that could arise from the contract switch.
"From the beginning of the process, the University asked bidders to honor the existing contract negotiated by the current vendor and Local 615, and Securitas has agreed to do so," Galvin said.
Langley said he expects that the contract swap will have a minimal effect on the workers and on the University. He said that such contracts come up for review frequently and noted that the evaluations are "always a subject of money and performance."
Harvard's outsourced security guards unionized in 2006 after two years of protracted negotiations. After the agreement was reached between AlliedBarton and SEIU, students, labor activists, and workers embarked on a campaign to secure a contract for the guards that included fair wages, steady, full-time work, a safe and sanitary workplace, and fair work procedures.
But negotiations stagnated, prompting students to take more drastic actions to support the workers and Union. Groups such as the Student Labor Action Movement and the Stand for Security Coalition organized extensive protests and even a nine-day hunger strike, which resulted in the hospitalization of two undergraduates, to encourage the University to intervene in the contract negotiations. The activism prompted University human resource officials to seek an expedited audit of AlliedBarton to ensure that the subcontractor met the University's hiring and wage parity requirements for in-house and outsourced workers.
Eventually, a contract was secured that guaranteed workers an increase in starting wages, the opportunity for an escalating pay scale, and a new grievance procedure.
