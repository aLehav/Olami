After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 'Quotes of the Week,' The Back Page will look each weekend at the five best quotes of the week, providing context for the five most important moments from the past seven days in Crimson sports.
 
“You know you can’t just walk away from this one. Those are points that we need right now.” — Freshman forward Sean Malone, men’s hockey
 
After starting the break with a three-game unbeaten streak, including a 7-4 victory over Boston University, the men’s hockey team (5-9-3, 2-7-3 ECAC) has struggled in recent losses to rivals Yale and Cornell. The team dropped to 2-7-3 in conference after the Cornell loss, leaving the Crimson 12 points out of first place.
 
“It makes logical sense to me that we are always trying to judge ourselves on controllable factors and though I care very, very deeply about the outcome in golf, namely the outcome of ‘the score,’ unfortunately it is a couple of steps removed from what we can actually control.” — Kevin Rhoads, men’s and women’s golf coach
 
In a Crimson feature in which Rhoads discussed the way that he instructs his golfers to approach the game, the golf coach illustrated a philosophy that focuses on the process and not the outcome. In a mentally strenuous game like golf, Rhoads keeps his players grounded by focusing on the lead-up to every shot, not the result.
 
“Our goal has been to try and get better as a team each game. No game is perfect and it doesn’t need to be, but there’s always something that can be worked upon. We come out of this game and say that we need to put two rebounding halves together.” – Kathy Delaney-Smith, women’s basketball coach
 
Delaney-Smith’s mantra of early improvement has proved effective for the women’s basketball team (11-4, 1-0 Ivy League) in the early parts of the season. With junior Temi Fagbenle leading the way (13.9 ppg, 9.9 rpg), the team has rattled off 11 wins in 14 contests since a 24-point defeat to DePaul in the season opener. The team has won five of its past six as it begins its home slate of conference play with a Jan. 25 matchup against Dartmouth.
 
“We have to work a lot harder… and not look past any teams and not assume anything about any teams based on their records. We’ve done a good job of that this year just taking it day by day. We let them get away with one yesterday and we are certainly not going to let anyone else do that.” – Maura Crowell, women’s hockey coach
 
Fuming after a rare loss by the women’s hockey team (13-2-2-, 9-2-1 ECAC), Crowell pointed to defensive lapses as the reason for the team’s 2-0 stumble against Yale on Saturday. However, the main culprit in the loss was the Crimson’s lackluster offense; the loss was just the third time all year Harvard did not score at least two goals and the first time it had been shut out.
 
“[This win] is a testament to how strong Harvard swimming is. We really built up a legacy and a tradition. It is something that we are really proud of, especially being a senior. We realize how lucky we are to be a part of such a successful team.” – senior Sara Li, women’s swimming and diving
 
In its only home dual meet of the season, the women’s swimming and diving team cruised to a 202-98 victory over Brown on Saturday. The Crimson has won three of four against Ivy League opponents, dispatching Dartmouth and Cornell and losing to Columbia, and placed 2nd at the MIT Invitational in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a precious nine days left until the school year begins, The Back Page previews the five games that Harvard students should keep their eyes on as the winter break winds down.
Men’s Hockey v. Colgate (Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Jan. 18)
 
After consecutive losses to rivals Yale and Cornell, the Crimson will look to bounce back at home against Colgate. The focus for the team will be on playing defense until the end of the period and not giving up the late goals that it did against the Big Red on Friday, when lapses at the end of the first two periods sunk the Crimson.
Wrestling v. Cornell (Ithaca, NY, Jan. 18)
 
In its first Ivy League contest of the season, the wrestling team will travel north to take on the sixth-ranked Big Red. So far, the team has struggled in the New Year, dropping three of five decisions since the turn of the calendar. After traveling to Ithaca, however, the Crimson will be at home for the next three matches.
Battle for Beantown, Women and Men’s Track and Field (Gordon Indoor Track, Jan. 18)
 
After a year off hosting the event, Harvard is again hosting the sixth Battle of Beantown. The women’s team, which finished second overall in the Dartmouth Relays earlier this year, has won the event three straight times. Last time the meet was held, the men’s team made it a clean sweep with a win on its home track in 2012.
 
Women’s Basketball v. Dartmouth (Lavietes Pavilion, Jan. 25)
 
Since an opening game 24-point loss to DePaul, Harvard has been on fire, winning 11 of its 14 matchups—including four consecutive double-digit wins as part of a six-game winning streak in November. Behind the efforts of senior guard Christine Clark (16.3 ppg, 4.2 rpg), the team is undefeated at home as it faces a Big Green squad it beat by 10, 73-63, on Jan. 26.
Men’s Basketball v. Dartmouth (Hanover, NH, Jan. 26)
The Crimson opened the Ivy League season with a 61-45 victory over the Big Green at home on Jan. 11 but will travel back to Hanover for the sequel just two weeks later. Big Green junior Gabas Maldunas dominated in the first matchup, scoring 23 points, but Crimson junior Wesley Saunders (injured in the first meeting) will give Harvard an offensive spark if he returns.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the Harvard wrestling team had a chance at knocking off No. 6 Cornell, everything needed to go its way. In addition to posting an undefeated record so far this season, the Big Red had emerged victorious in 58 consecutive Ivy League dual meets.
However, for the Crimson (2-4, 0-1 Ivy), little went according to plan on Saturday. Wrestling on its home mats, Cornell (5-0, 1-0) controlled the match from start to finish and earned a 33-6 victory.
The Big Red found wins in a number of ways – including a major decision, pin, technical fall, and a win by forfeit – and the resulting bonus points made it difficult for Harvard to bridge the gap.
Despite falling short on the overall score, the Crimson battled to win two of the ten matches on the day. Furthermore, a pair of Harvard losses came by two points or fewer, and another wrestler battled to force overtime.
But in the end, the Crimson found itself outmatched by a Cornell squad that sent three nationally ranked wrestlers to the mat on Saturday.
“I just wanted our guys to fight,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We’ve put the time in training-wise, and when we compete those are the times you’ve got to bring that training out…. I think we could have performed better, but I told them after the match, no matter whether you win or lose, you take away something.”
The Crimson fell into a 6-0 hole by forfeiting the opening match of the day at 125 lbs., as both of the team’s wrestlers at that weight have been out with injuries for the entire dual meet season.
Harvard would bounce right back to get on the scoreboard when junior Ryan Osleeb earned points in all three periods to cruise to a 7-0 victory at 133 lbs.
Sophomore Todd Preston took to the mat next and looked to build on Osleeb’s momentum in a tough matchup against No. 11 Mike Nevinger. The duel went down to the wire after two scoreless periods, but Nevinger earned a point through an escape with minutes to go that would prove to be the difference.
“I thought I pushed the pace well, but I obviously didn’t open up on offense and I didn’t get him uncomfortable,” Preston said. “I was content with keeping it close, and that kind of hurt me in the end. I need to go out in that first period and get that takedown and control the match better.”
The Crimson found itself in contention after those first three matches, trailing by a score of 9-3. But the Big Red quickly took control by claiming victory in five straight bouts to build a commanding lead.
In the 149 weight class, sophomore Nicholas Stager suffered a 14-0 defeat in a major decision at the hands of Cornell’s Conner David. A few minutes later, in the last contest before halftime, freshman Tyler Grimaldi battled in the third period but could not avoid taking a 10-5 loss.
The Big Red run continued at 165 lbs. when No. 17 Dylan Palacio achieved a fall over Harvard freshman Colton Peppelman in the first period. Crimson freshman Eric Morris nearly stopped the bleeding in the next match by forcing overtime, but his opponent secured a takedown in extra time to earn the victory and stretch the Cornell lead to 23.
“Wrestling the top guys in the country, that’s where you’re going to get that experience,” Preston said. “Being able to wrestle these guys is a good thing for us, but in order to achieve our goals we’re going to have to start beating these guys and not just keeping the matches close.”
One of those top-ranked wrestlers for the Big Red, No. 2 Gabe Dean, stepped to the mat at 184 lbs. to face off against co-captain Cameron Croy. Dean took advantage of a big second period to ride to a 21-5 victory over Croy and improve his record to 23-2 on the year.
Harvard would get its second win in the penultimate match of the day, when co-captain James Fox broke a tie in the second period and tacked on more points in the third against another tough Cornell opponent.
“[Fox] pulled out that win when he was supposed to,” Weiss said. “I think he’s starting to get into his groove right now, because he was out for a little bit. It should be fun in the upcoming weeks.”
Although the overall match had already been decided, junior David Ng rounded out the day’s action in the heavyweight spot. Despite battling to within a point, Ng could not take the lead and fell, 7-5.
In last season’s loss to the Big Red, the Crimson won five of the day’s 10 matches. That number fell to two this year, as Harvard was unable to prevail in several close contests.
“We’ve got to wrestle strong in the third period, and we’ve got to win overtime matches. Those are the things we stress,” Weiss said. “In college wrestling, no matter who you’re wrestling, it’s going to be a close battle. You’ve got to put yourself in those positions where you can pull out close bouts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the other members of the Harvard squash teams took the week off, senior Ali Farag and junior Amanda Sobhy did not take a rest over the weekend. The number one players for the men’s and women’s squash teams, respectively, Farag and Sobhy competed against the world’s best squash players in the J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions.
Farag battled through the qualifying round and into the main draw with two Friday wins over top-50 opponents but ultimately fell in his first main draw match, losing to world no. 26 Chris Simpson in four sets. On the women’s side, Sobhy won her first qualifying match and will have a chance Sunday to qualify for the main draw.
After winning his first qualifying match, Farag earned a qualifying berth with a straight-set win over Cesar Salazar, 11-9, 11-4, 12-10. It was Farag’s first trip to the main draw.
Both players arrived at the tournament at the top of their respective games. The two arrived in Cambridge in fall 2011, going undefeated and winning the individual national championships that year. Sobhy defended her title last year, taking down Trinity’s Kanzy El Dafrawy in the finals of the individual championships. Farag’s back-to-back effort came up just short, however, as he lost in the semifinals to the eventual tournament champion.
Before coming to Boston, Sobhy became the first American to capture the World Junior Squash Championship in 2010, taking home the world title on her seventeenth birthday. She was the top-ranked American after the win, but it wasn’t until a year later—after winning the CSA championship—that she reached a career-high rank of no. 17 in April 2011.
Farag took a different route, playing his freshman year at American University before transferring to Harvard. In the month he arrived on campus, he was ranked a career high of no. 68. Since, a lack of international play has dropped his rank out of the top 200.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team was able to keep its head above water, coming in third place in its quad meet.
The Crimson (5-2, 4-0 Ivy League) defeated Wisconsin 221.50-145.50, but fell to No. 18 Virginia 222.50-147.50 and finished behind the host team, No. 15 Virginia Tech, 232.50-137.50 Friday and Saturday at the Christiansburg Aquatic Center in Blacksburg, Virginia.
On Friday night, Harvard claimed its two first-place finishes with the sport’s simplest stroke, winning both the 100 yard freestyle and 400 yard freestyle relay.
“It felt really good to beat competitive teams like Virginia and Virginia Tech who are ranked much higher than us,” senior Griffin Schumacher said. “When we can place like that it feels good because it means good things for the program going forward both in the long run and looking toward Ivy League championships in March.”
Schumacher had a hand in each event, winning the 100 free in 44.84 and anchoring the 400 free relay with a 44.86 on the first 100 yards to start the race for Harvard. The other freestyle swimmers contributing to the first place finish were classmates Danny Crigler, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite.
The same relay team was able to pull out another first place finish on Saturday, finishing the 200 yard freestyle relay in 1:21.19, a mere eight-tenths of a second before second-place Virginia Tech.
“On both relays that we won we’ve had the same three or four guys on that relay for roughly two years now, so the core of each of those relays has really been locked in which has given us a lot of opportunities to practice and get used to swimming together,” Satterthwaite said.
The 100 yard freestyle race also saw Satterthwaite and Lee finish in the top ten, with times of 45.15 and 46.01, respectively. Crigler finished the race in 46.47, which landed him in eleventh place.
Schumacher also came out ahead in the 50 free, which he won in 20.33, coming in less than a half a second before Virginia Tech’s Joe Bonk, who finished the race in 20.56. Satterthwaite and Lee also were not far behind, coming in third and fourth respectively with times of 20.85 and 20.88. Teammate freshman Paul O’Hara came in ninth in the event, touching the wall at 21.24.
Sophomore Jacob Luna also turned in successful swims for Harvard. He placed third in the 100 yard butterfly with a time of 49.88, as well as a 1:53.47 swim in the 200 IM that landed him in sixth place.
“We had some stronger events on Friday and then our middle session on Saturday we unfortunately are not as strong, but we definitely tried to use that momentum [from Friday] and even in some of those losses we pulled out some really strong swims,” Schumacher said.
Freshman Eric Ronda handed the Crimson three top five finishes, coming in second in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.89 and placing fourth in the 100 breaststroke, touching the wall at 56.99. Ronda was also an anchor in Harvard’s seventh place finish in the 200 freestyle relay, and a part of the Crimson’s third place finish in the 400 medley relay.
The Crimson also found success in the 200 yard freestyle, where two Harvard swimmers placed in the top five. Satterthewaite came in third, turning in a time of 1:39.42 and junior Spenser Goodman followed close behind, finishing fifth in 1:39.96.
“A lot of us have been doing a lot of specific work, so the guys are kind of broken down at this point,” Satterthwaite said. “I think we raced pretty fast and accomplished some of the objectives we set out to [which were] primarily to be aggressive in racing some of these faster teams we don’t get to see during the regular season.”
On the diving side, Harvard placed eighth and 13th off the three meter platform. Senior Joe Zarella scored 317.90 points, while freshman Manasseh Oso recorded 257.65 points. From the one meter board, Zarella came in tenth with a score of 283.00 followed by Oso with a 249.20.
Although the Crimson did not come out on top, the team still has hope to improve upon its times further into the season.
“The important thing is to take everything into perspective,” Satterthwaite said. “Ultimately our goal is to win an Ivy championship at the end of the season and that we won’t see some of these tops times until then so we still have some time to work on our swims.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renewed energy in the second and third periods was too little, too late for the Crimson on Saturday night as Harvard fell to Colgate, 4-2, at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
After giving up three early goals, the Crimson (5-10-3, 2-8-3 ECAC) was simply unable to keep up as the Raiders (11-9-3, 7-3-1) outskated the squad for the duration of the match, giving Harvard its second loss of the weekend.
“We fought back,” Harvard coach Ted Donato said. “We had some chances all the way to the end, but we just weren’t able to get one by. We fell behind way too easily, gave up way too easily, and that was the story of our game.”
The beginning of the second period was a turning point for the Crimson as sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek entered the game. Colgate continued to test the defense all throughout the period, taking 11 shots on goal, but all 11 were stopped by Michalek. The substitution worked as Michalek and the defensive line managed to keep the Raiders scoreless for the second twenty minutes of the game.
“Our offense really helped our defense tonight,” sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo said. “But Steve also came in and played a great game. He was able to come in and shut the door for us and make some big stops.”
This defensive push was followed by an offensive rush in the third period, as the Crimson registered a game-high 10 attempted shots in the last twenty minutes. Harvard capitalized on a power play opportunity with two minutes left on the clock, pulling Michalek from the game to create an advantage for the Crimson. Criscuolo was able to finish on sophomore Jimmy Vesey’s assist, powering the puck past Colgate goaltender Charlie Finn to bring Harvard within a point of the Raiders.
The goal was the second of the night for Criscuolo. After trailing for close to 40 minutes, Harvard had found the back of the net near the end of the second period when Criscuolo utilized an assist from freshman Luke Esposito.
With the gap closed to 3-2 and one minute to go, Donato pulled Michalek again.  The Crimson fought to tie the game, but lost possession of the puck to the Raiders.
With its goalie benched, Harvard found itself unable to stop Colgate from solidifying the win. Colgate’s Ryan Johnston sent the puck sailing into Harvard’s empty net to take the final two point lead over the Crimson, 4-2.
“We need to find a way to come out and play with a lead, instead of fighting from behind for the win,” Donato said. “Responding to what other teams do every night is not the way we want to go about recapturing success.”
Harvard’s dynamic second and third period performances came in response to a first period dictated by the Colgate offense, as three different players managed to register scores for the Raiders.
After Colgate’s Mike McCann got the Raiders on the scoreboard, the Crimson continued to lose control of the puck, committing turnovers and handing the Raiders key scoring opportunities.
“We were on our heels a little bit,” Donato said. “They didn’t score on the first power play, but I certainly think it changed the momentum of the game.”
While Harvard managed to stop three different power play opportunities in the opening period, two of which came back-to-back, the Raiders were still able to capitalize in the first twenty minutes.
After McCann’s initial goal, Colgate’s Tylor Spink outmaneuvered the Crimson defenders and junior goaltender Peter Traber at close range to bring the score to 2-0. The gap was soon widened when Daniel Gentzler snaked past the Crimson defense to give his squad the 3-0 lead.
“Our start today cost us a lot of the game,” Donato said. “[Colgate] had some great scoring chances and I give them a lot of credit. They moved the puck well, they skated well. I think it is a good sign that we battled back in the second and third, but falling behind three nothing at home makes for a deep hole to come out of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team dug itself an early hole on Saturday that the team was unable to overcome.
Three opposing first period goals proved too much for the Crimson, as the squad fell to Colgate at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, 4-2.
“[We] turned the puck over, took a couple of penalties,” Harvard coach Ted Donato said. “And it all led into them having an opportunity to really get skating and put us in our zone.”
Coming off a close loss to No. 12 Cornell on Friday, the Crimson (5-10-3, 2-8-3 ECAC) was unable to salvage its weekend slate with a win against the Raiders (11-9-3, 7-3-1). This weekend marks the second time this season that the Harvard has lost both home games in a single weekend.
Saturday was also the second consecutive night in which the Crimson trailed by one in the last minutes of the game, but was unable to tie the game and force overtime by pulling the goalie.
SLOW START
Despite scoring two goals in the last forty minutes compared to Colgate’s one, Harvard was never able to recover from the Raiders’ first period offensive attack.
Such a trend has been prevalent in recent play. In the Crimson’s past three games, the team has surrendered an average of two goals in the first period alone, while averaging less than two goals per game offensively in the same time frame. Furthermore, Saturday marked the fifth straight game in which Harvard has allowed the first goal of the game.
“We need to put a more complete game together,” Donato said. “I think it’s a good sign we battled back in the second and third… but playing from behind is not a recipe for success consistently.”
CRAFTY CRISCUOLO
After a slow first period, the Crimson offense emerged behind the performance of Kyle Criscuolo. The second year player notched two goals on the night to help pull Harvard within one in the waning seconds of the contest.
Both of Criscuolo’s goals came on the man advantage. Less than five minutes into the second period, freshman forward Luke Esposito fed the sophomore right in front of the goal, and Criscuolo promptly buried it into the net to reduce the deficit to two.
The sophomore forward’s second goal came with less than two minutes remaining in the game. With Colgate’s Daniel Gentzler in the penalty box for slashing, the Crimson pulled the goalie to give the squad a two-man advantage. Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey put a shot on net, which Criscuolo deflected past goaltender Charlie Finn to cut the Raiders’ lead down to one.
“Luckily I was in the slot for both of [my goals],” Criscuolo said. “The second one was a great look by Vesey, coming down and looking off the defenders. The first one was a great pass by [Esposito].”
With his two goals on the night, Criscuolo is now tied for most goals on the team with ten. Hobey Baker nominee Jimmy Vesey has also found the net ten times on the season. The duo has notched four power play goals on the year apiece, also team-highs.
SOLID SPECIALITY TEAM PLAY
Harvard continued its strong performance on the penalty kill this season. The Crimson was able stave off the Raiders’ five opportunities on the night, twice in order to keep the team within striking distance.
Harvard ranks second in the ECAC with an 88.4 percent kill rate on the year. Only No. 5 Quinnipiac has had more success on the year with a rate of 90.2 percent.
The Crimson was also successful on the power play. The team converted on two of its five power plays on the night, a rate much higher than the team’s 15.8 percent rate on the entire year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, the Harvard women’s hockey team finally broke through. The No. 5/6 Crimson beat No. 3 Cornell in Ithaca for the first time since the 2008-09 season. Junior captain Marissa Gedman scored the deciding goal in the second period and sophomore Mary Parker tallied an empty-netter late in the contest to seal a 3-1 victory.
Harvard (14-2-2, 10-2-1 ECAC) now sits first in the ECAC standings after failing to garner a first-place vote in the preseason coaches’ poll.
“All season people have talked about the adversity we faced, but the confidence in ourselves is unwavering,” Gedman said. “Now people are seeing the teams we are beating and they are starting to respect us as much as we respect ourselves.”
The win is particularly energizing for a team that had a slow start to 2014. The Crimson lost to Yale last weekend and had to come from behind on Friday to beat a Colgate squad that is 5-17-2 on the year.
“We are just proving how good we can be,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “It’s been a tough start to the new year here and there, clearly Friday night as well, but they got together and showed what they are capable of [on Saturday].”
Gedman’s goal was her most impactful in two years, if not more. Her only other two scores this season came in blowout wins and she missed all of last year with a leg injury.  The defender got the tally on Saturday by redirecting a pass from junior Samantha Reber to break a 1-1 tie in the second period.
The pass to Gedman was Reber’s second assist of the day, as she had previously fed sophomore Miye D’Oench, who gave the Crimson an early 1-0 lead in the first by threading a shot past Cornell goaltender Lauren Slebodnick nearside. The Big Red (14-2-3, 9-1-2) found an answer before the end of the period, however, as Anna Zorn redirected a shot past sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.
Cornell failed to muster a response to Gedman’s goal though. The home team outshot Harvard, 12-6, in the second period and 13-6 in the third, but could not get a second attempt past Maschmeyer. The Big Red had been held to one goal in just two of its previous 25 games.
“We had great games out of all our defensemen, especially Gedman,” Crowell said. “[Junior Sarah Edney and Gedman] set the tone back there. They are really experienced defenseman who acted that way.”
Holding onto a 2-1 advantage for almost all of the third period, Harvard relied on its experience to prevent its lead from slipping, Gedman said. The Crimson lost two leads in a 3-3 tie with Cornell in November and also let Boston College salvage a tie with a late goal in the squads’ December matchup.
“It’s happened in the past and we know what it feels like to lose that lead,” Gedman said. “We knew we just had to bear down for a couple more minutes.”
Crowell noticed that her skaters were more confident with the puck in the final moments on Saturday than they had been in previous close games.
“It’s awesome to get the win this time, not the tie,” she said.
In addition to beating the team’s biggest rival in a venue no member of the squad had won in before, Saturday’s victory is significant because of its implications on ECAC standings.
Harvard now has 21 points in conference to Cornell’s 20 (Clarkson and Quinnipiac are in third with 18), though the Big Red has a game in hand. A Crimson win Saturday was crucial for its hopes of playing at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center late in the ECAC Tournament. Cornell has hosted the tournament final for four straight years, and beat Harvard at Lynah Rink, 2-1, last season.
“We needed that win because we needed the points,” Gedman said. “There was definitely a lot of fuel for our fire tonight.”

Flyby hopes that everyone in the Harvard community is enjoying their break, but we want to remind you not to ignore your nerdy side as you catch up with high-school buddies, townsfolk, and family. Here are a few book recommendations (either for this break or the summer) so that you can begin conversations with the oh-so-Harvard “Well currently I’m reading…”
For the English major/literature enthusiast:
 "As I Lay Dying" by William Faulkner. I like to call William Faulkner the Louis C.K. of modernism. And that’s not just a moniker to make Faulkner seem less pretentious: if you’re willing to look past the stream-of-consciousness and tricky dialect, Faulkner really is (darkly) humorous. "As I Lay Dying" was an easier read than "The Sound and the Fury" (cue shudders as people recall AP Literature from high school), but still hits on big themes of the "old" vs. "new" South, death, religion, and adaptation.
 "The Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck: A high-school English teacher tells me to this day that Steinbeck lacks a sense of humor and is hard to get through. Patently false, Mr. Lynch. While Steinbeck doesn’t have the same knack for dark irony as Faulkner, "The Grapes of Wrath" is incredible. The story about the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression and a family’s flight to California is compelling and fast-moving. Though by no means light-hearted (can you really blame an author writing about the Depression for that?), Steinbeck’s ability to write a damn good sentence is enough to make the book worth it. Fans of John Locke, look for and soak in the long conversations about property rights and identity in the first ten chapters.
 (Modern) Fiction:
"The Son" by Philipp Meyer: The only book published in 2013 on the list. Think of Hemingway or Steinbeck-esque writing (i.e. very pretty prose but not particularly difficult) but the thematic weight of a Faulkner or Flannery O’Conner (i.e. a coming-of-age novel, the South dealing with the influences of modernity and the North, etc.). Unlike many writers nowadays (I’m looking at you, John Grisham), Meyer doesn’t try to write the novel version of a movie or a television show but actually focuses on enhancing theme and plot with hard-nosed, piercing writing and an eye for philosophy.
Non-Fiction:
"The Nine" by Jeffrey Toobin: Though a few years old, this is a compelling read about the Supreme Court (largely the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts, with plenty of fodder for the hipster who wants to rant about Bush v. Gore over a micro-brew with his friends). In addition, it is interesting to see how Toobin writes about the Justices as people with complex opinions rather than cogs in a political machine.
Inspirational/Read This Before You Get Back to Campus and Lock Yourself In Lamont:
"This is Water" by David Foster Wallace: The whole speech, which is available in a short book, not the short movie—though that is also wonderful. Before everyone gets caught up in how difficult their schedule is, they could use a reminder about choosing how to relate to others and view their own experiences, however frustrating.
Enjoy your breaks and pick up a book or two!
