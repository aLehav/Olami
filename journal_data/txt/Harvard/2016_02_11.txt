"My daughters are trained for battle, sir, not the kitchen," Mr. Bennet says midway through “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” a film based on Seth Grahame-Smith’s Jane Austen adaptation. Though the concept of mixing the supernatural with a beloved Austen classic might sound bizarre, “Zombies” makes it work with a strong cast, stellar cinematography, and a script that perfectly blends the language of nineteenth century England with the tropes of a monster movie.
"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" is exactly what the title suggests: A story of love, misconception, and the undead. Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) is not the iron-willed young lady of the British Regency that readers have come to know through Austen’s book. Rather, she is all that and more––a skilled warrior, trained in the art of zombie-killing. While battling the undead, Elizabeth and her four sisters navigate the social customs of the British Regency as their mother desperately attempts to marry them off. Thankfully for Mrs. Bennet, Jane Bennet (Bella Heathcote) and Elizabeth catch the eyes of the incredibly wealthy Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) and Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley), respectively. Drama ensues as the zombies grow in intellect and numbers, and Elizabeth soon finds herself wrapped up in bloody warfare and her own confused feelings of love.
The plot follows the “Pride and Prejudice” timeline smoothly, with the addition of a zombie-fighting lifestyle. The script seamlessly weaves both concepts together through exhilarating action and quick dialogue. The Bennet sisters casually polish their weapons as their parents argue about whether studying combat in Japan is better-suited for young ladies than studying combat in China, as if they were arguing whether piano or painting were a better art form for the sisters to take up. At times, this combination also emphasizes certain feelings in a scene, like when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy nearly kill each other as they argue about whether or not Mr. Bingley and Jane should be a couple. Both parties’ anger is manifested in the dialogue and in how Elizabeth nearly stabs Mr. Darcy’s prejudiced heart—metaphorically and literally.
While performing a script that requires actors to brandish swords while maintaining the propriety of Austen’s original ladies and gentlemen, several members of the "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" cast shine. In particular, Lily James accurately emulates the stubborn nature and steadfast familial love Elizabeth for which is known, both when socializing and while on the battlefield. “My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me,” she scoffs as a man possibly twice her weight nearly chokes her to death in order to prevent her from marrying Mr. Darcy. Her face and tone of voice consistently reflect a mix of dignified anger and resolve, matching Elizabeth’s character perfectly. As the protagonist, it’s no surprise that she anchors the movie with exceptional acting.
The same cannot be said for Sam Riley, however, whose portrayal of Mr. Darcy falls flat. Though quiet and reserved, he doesn’t possess the same level of haughtiness for which Elizabeth is suppose to hate Mr. Darcy. Thankfully, other actors make up for Riley’s subpar performance—notably Matt Smith, whose role as Mr. Collins is astoundingly fitting. Thanks to Smith, Collins is awkward, somewhat goofy, and entirely devoid of social tact, just as he should be. Smith overexaggerates Collins’s character in a comical fashion, drawing out his voice as he lauds about the great Lady Catherine de Bourgh and adopting a high-tilting one as he repeatedly cries out “Splendid!” after a dance, much to Elizabeth’s embarrassment.
"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" also delivers in terms of cinematography. Lighting is dark and minimal during serious or suspenseful moments. A slight blue tint is occasionally present, creating an eerie feeling, in scenes such as when Jane stumbles across a zombie family in the woods. Some poignant scenes, like when Jane discovers the truth about George Wickham and Mr. Darcy, are set against sweeping countrysides and bathed in a soft golden light. The movie’s coloring and lighting convey whatever emotion the movie steers itself into—a touch both beautiful and helpful in telling the story.
"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" is an entertaining movie with no serious faults [or mishaps. Thanks to its experienced cast, lively script, and gorgeous cinematography, the film joins the ranks of other successful “Pride and Prejudice” adaptations, perfect for crowds who are looking to kill time in a fun way.

Graphic novelist and illustrator Adrian Tomine visited the Harvard Book Store with fellow artist Leanne Shapton last Thursday to speak about his newest graphic novel “Killing and Dying.” Tomine, a New York Times Notable Book award winner, is well-known for illustrating New Yorker cover art and starting his Optic Nerve comic book series at the young age of sixteen. His work explores human nature and the complex feelings that come with everyday interactions using subtle and poignant illustrations. A few days before his and Shapton’s event, The Harvard Crimson spoke with Tomine about “Killing and Dying” and the processes that went into the creation of this graphic novel.
The Harvard Crimson: Do you see any of your own experiences from being a father, or husband, or even living in Brooklyn reflected in the stories you write?
Adrian Tomine: [“Killing and Dying” is] kind of me thinking back and imagining myself back in the California environment that I grew up in. I don’t think I would be so interested in the little precise details of these suburban strip malls if I was still living in the middle of them.
I think being married changes the focus of the work a lot. My early comics are really reflective of being kind of a befuddled, single loser in the Bay Area, and I think having kids has been by far the most profound impact on me as a person and as an artist. I didn’t set out to make “Killing and Dying” about parents and children or anything like that. I wasn’t even thinking of it consciously [but] when the book was finished I looked back on it and thought…. almost every story somewhat relates to parental responsibility or the failure of it.
THC: What were you hoping to accomplish with this graphic novel?
AT: I was really pushing myself to tap into feelings and thoughts that I might have been nervous about in the past, and to be really ruthless about cutting out things that I thought might be too sentimental or cliche.
THC: How did you get in touch with those feelings and anxieties in the process of creating “Killing and Dying?”
AT: What was a very private childhood hobby turned into a very a public, professional job and I think that there’s a lot of inhibition that can grow from that. For me, one of the things that I consciously did with “Killing and Dying” was put myself back in the mindset of working as a complete amateur [when] I was doing stuff for myself and for my own enjoyment and not worrying so much about how it was going to be received. [However,] a lot of personal, subconscious, personal things started seeping into it and I kind of just allowed them to flow in.
THC: Your stories sometimes differ from each other stylistically. For example, “Translated, from the Japanese,” a story in “Killing and Dying,” has no lines bordering its panels or blocks of text. Why is this?
AT: A lot of it has to do with what would most effectively tell the story. The kind of detailed illustrations that i did for “Translated, from the Japanese” would be very cumbersome with a story like “Go Owls” where I’m just trying to communicate with the dialogue and action.
[It’s] also just trying to enjoy the freedom of doing a short story collection. To me, one of the big fears of doing a big huge graphic novel is locking yourself into one style and getting halfway through it and going “Oh I made the wrong choice,” which is a recurring nightmare I have.
THC: “Killing and Dying,” is composed of six stories: “A Brief History of the Art Form Known as ‘Hortisculpture,” “Amber Sweet,” “Go Owls,” “Translated, from the Japanese,” “Killing and Dying,” and “Intruders.” Why choose to make “Killing and Dying” the title of your graphic novel?
AT: “Killing and Dying” was actually the one that my publisher and I immediately ruled out. It’s like the two words that people hate to think about the most. And then, the more I started thinking about it, I thought like “You know, I have this sort of history of doing books [that are] very quiet and gentle.” I’ve always wanted to do something a little bolder. I thought, “Yeah, let me go with the boldest and most perplexing title…. This isn’t the time for me as an artist to stick my publisher and booksellers across the country with an obscure looking book with a forgettable title. These are kind of desperate times and I need to make a book that will get people’s attention.”

“I wish I had money,” Tom Rakewell sings in “The Rake’s Progress” just before these five short words begin to dismantle his life. Produced by Harvard College Opera and the Office for the Arts at Harvard, Igor Stravinsky’s classic opera ran from Feb. 3 to Feb. 6 at the Agassiz Theater. This interpretation of “The Rake’s Progress” effectively combined expressive acting, strong musical performances, and technical ingenuity for an entertaining and impressive opera.
“The Rake’s Progress” depicts the story of Tom Rakewell (Andy J. Troska ’17), a young, lazy dreamer who hopes to live life with no worries and to stumble upon the means by which to live it. This wish is miraculously granted when a mysterious uncle dies and leaves Tom a fortune, brought to him through his new servant, Nick Shadow (Eric Ritter of Boston University). Nick leads him to desert his true love, Anne Trulove (Asia T. Stewart '18), under the pretense of needing him to take care of legal procedures to secure his fortune. However, Shadow first takes him to a brothel, which begins his descent into dissolution, dissatisfaction, and distress.
While the plot is rather simple, the actors used it as a basis to show the range of their singing and acting abilities. With emotive performances, the actors gave their characters depth and conveyed more than a simple story. Troska’s anguished songs and closing despair showed that behind his character’s seemingly fulfilling life of thrill-seeking and debauchery lay an element of guilt, loss, and unhappiness. Likewise, in Anne’s aria, “No word from Tom,” Stewart heartbreakingly portrayed romantic abandonment and concern for a loved one. In contrast, Randa R. Melhem ’16, as Tom’s new, bearded wife, Baba the Turk, provided comedic relief. Director Joule P. Voelz ’17 excellently staged Troska and Melhem’s dynamic as husband and wife, as Melhem nags at her husband to the point where he has to silence her. Her superb singing and success in capturing Baba’s chattering nature and exasperation gave a lighthearted and memorable twist to the show.
The opera was further bolstered by its technical elements. Working with little scenery, the crew expertly transformed each prop to fit the scene: The same small table helped create the settings of a country home, brothel, and fashionable apartment. This cleverness extended to the lighting, designed by Kathleen Zhou ’17, which mainly took the form of a colored screen in the background, which filled the entire stage with red to convey danger, pink or green for happiness, or blue for sadness.
The students behind “The Rake’s Progress,” from the accompanists to the actors and staff, took up the challenges of Stravinsky with memorable aplomb. Aiming high and executing confidently and creatively, the show was truly opera done well.

“There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion."
—Sir Francis Bacon
The Harvard Museum of Natural History is a venerable, creaky old building. Situated two minutes away from the concrete behemoth of the university's Science Center, the red brick walls and heavy wooden doors house the objects of a different age of investigation. Dead crustaceans curl in transparent jars filled with yellowing fluid; fragile butterflies hang pinned to corkboard on the walls. Ascending to the third story of this institutional curio-cabinet, take a left past the illustrious glass flowers in their dimly lit cases, past the rows of exotic sea shells and fading stuffed birds: Here, in this far corner of the museum, rare animals flash with brilliant light. Caught forever by the skill of two Dresden jewelers, each glass sea creature swims crystallized in a frozen moment, arrested for the fascination of the eye. In this case of transparent confections, one fragile beast appears the most delicate of all. In its ocean environment, the Oaten Pipes Hydroid (Tubularia indivisa) twists and flutters in undersea currents–a hairy, bushy sort of animal that clings like an alien spider onto tolerant rocks. Stringlike tentacles abound. The hydroid's many pink hydranths gasp and pucker; tiny plankton swim into this cloud of greedy mouths. As a work of nature, it's beautiful and intricate. It's also a wild thing, a marine gargoyle, as far from our terrestrial knowledge and experience as any fiction of the screen. Orderly and refined, Harvard’s glass model draws a sharp contrast with this fairy monster of the sea. The exquisite handiwork of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, it is more an elegant alter ego than a true imitation. A much-pruned version of its messy referent, our Oaten Pipes Hydroid grows with dainty composure from rigid brown stems, opening into a set of decorous little flowers. Twelve, like those of the ancient Greek hydra––the only retelling of its beastly origins the Hydroid permits. It's so lovely, so refined, so ready for an introduction to polite society: The Eliza Doolittle of 19th century science, or perhaps the Blaschka's Cinderella.
Like that princess of humble origins, the Oaten Pipes Hydroid transformed itself through the efforts of a fantastic glassworker; however, the Hydroid's new ornamental status was bought at the cost of a certain authenticity. In this Arts column, I aim to illustrate how the hands of two jewelers finished its conversion from a tangled organic mass to a thing of gemlike beauty. I will also explain how their painstaking work fits into the story of science, creating order and meaning out of muddled reality. Like the Blaschkas, we'll turn our minds to the production of glass. As this project of reformation rooted itself in three glass technologies—the aquarium, the microscope, and lampworking—its history will be told in three interlocking acts, with prelude and conclusion.
The Sea and the Stars:
Our story begins in the waters of Portugal, near the mild climes of the Azores islands. It is 1853, and on what he would later describe as “a beautiful night in May,” Leopold Blaschka stands on the deck of a ship bound for America, looking out at the dark, reflective sea. He is 31 years old. Over the last three years, he mourned the death of his wife and father. He closed the family business–a glass jewelry workshop–to take a trip to a foreign country. But halfway to his destination, his ship becalmed near a series of remote islands in the Atlantic Ocean, leaving him with little to do but study the local jellyfish.
As Leopold stands watch over the sea’s inky mirror, he searches for their characteristic glimmer in the darkness. After the death of his spouse, Leopold sought solace in natural history, a time-consuming hobby. He’d seen illustrated invertebrates before, but examining the animals live, the jeweler became fascinated by the qualities that elude capture on paper––luminous transparent flesh, crystalline brilliance. Tonight, his patient attention is rewarded by the appearance of a school of jellies, glittering “as if surrounded by thousands of sparks...mirrored stars.” Leopold admires the lovely sight, blind to all that is about to occur, unaware that the series of events destined to bind him to these shimmering creatures is already, that same year, starting to unfold … .

The album cover has carried cultural weight for a long time. Some of recorded music’s highest triumphs have been largely defined and identified in pop culture by the visuals that accompanied them: The unshakeable cool behind the album covers of Blue Note’s 1500 series helped spur a new generation of jazz innovators towards international stardom; The Beatles made a crosswalk one of London’s most famous landmarks with their cover for “Abbey Road”; Pink Floyd gave generations of stoners and dreamers a visual touchstone with the prism of “Dark Side of the Moon”; everyone from Phil Collins to Art Garfunkel to Madonna piped 12-by-12 inch images of their faces into millions of American homes on their LP sleeves.
Digital music’s rise to ubiquity at the beginning of the 21st century forced the meaning surrounding an album cover to evolve in subtle ways. An album’s cover art was no longer associated with the music itself in such a close, physical sense; freed from CDs and vinyl, music no longer depended so heavily on the jewel cases and LP sleeves plastered with art that had accompanied it for so long. While album art still traveled with music wherever it went, a small image in the corner of your iTunes window is obviously less attention-grabbing than a 12-inch sleeve or even a CD-sized insert.
Paralleling the physical relegation of album art, though, were a host of new, exciting opportunities for digitally transmitting visual information. The proliferation of the .jpg, .png, and .gif gave birth to a more democratic visual world—one that does not depend on a printer to spread an image. But it meant that the art accompanying albums had much more visual noise to fight through, especially on our computer screens. At the same time, that democratization gave album arts some new, thrilling avenues to travel. In the present decade especially, artists have started to take advantage of the digital proliferation of their album art to usher in a new era of interactive musical iconography.
A demonstrative example of this phenomenon exists in the cult hit vaporwave album “Floral Shoppe,” released in 2011 by electronic artist Vektroid. Today, the album’s art is probably more famous than the music itself, largely due to its extreme affinity for endless, ridiculous, mad recreation and parody. While the visual chaos surrounding Vektroid’s album art at first looks like the meaningless product of teenagers with too much time on their hands, spend a little more time with it—and with the album—and you’ll see that’s just the point: The offhand sheen of vaporwave belies a deep nihilism. The genre, which almost indiscriminately mixes influences from all strata of popular culture, at its core probes the meaninglessness that comes with such a cacophonous clash of information. It’s a genre born of the internet, for internet-ridden minds. How does it feel to be confronted so constantly with such garishly meaningless stimuli? Listen to “Floral Shoppe” on loop while you scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll begin to know. The album’s art, [with its ridiculous combination of statue, typeface, and color scheme, embodies this question and allows its meaning to grow with the internet age’s toughest questions.
Album art can weasel its way into our digital habits in a more offhanded way as well. California rap duo Death Grips, whose appeal is largely reliant on their internet infamy, released “Government Plates” in November of 2013, with an ostensibly simple cover: A California license plate with the word “DEATH” on it, photographed at a slight angle. As a physical album cover, the angle at which the plate sits doesn’t accomplish much, save giving the photo a little bit of physical depth. Played on an iPod Classic, though, the album cover accomplishes something uncanny: The iPod’s display format tilts the album cover just enough so the plate faces straight out of the screen. The iPod screen forces users to look “DEATH” in the face, while outside of an iPod, the album cover’s message angles slightly away. These newly participatory album covers both take from and give back to the internet culture from which they come; the art of “Government Plates” grabs a certain set of digital listeners in a unique way and pays homage to a true “classic”—the iPod that empowered a generation to carry an entire music library in their pockets.
In 2015 album art’s formerly subtle digital forays began to enter the mainstream. Drake’s “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” art inspired a font that has led to countless parodies. The role that album art played in the publicity campaign behind Madonna’s “Rebel Heart” prompted outrage over racial insensitivity. Future’s “DS2” album art visually inspired a Robitussin commercial. While the physical presence of album covers retreats further and further away from us, their images creep quietly and subversively closer.

Last week, controversial artist Zayn Malik released the music video for his single “Pillowtalk,” which quickly rose in the charts to take over the number one spot in the U.K. This debut is a far cry from his previous One Direction hits, and those searching for topics with more gravity and new meaning were not disappointed. The song superficially meditates on subjects such as sex and the true definition of intimacy. But its music video betrays its true interest: Advancing the artistic agenda to destroy every binary, ever, from gender to relationship status. Welcome to the future.
The video is reminiscent of a David Lynch dream sequence, bringing the viewer into the mind of an unidentified being, which gives these meditations a more human perspective. The juxtaposed images follow a barely definable but existent train of logic. The cuts oscillate between extremes, only to settle on a newly defined “gray area.” These extremes include: Zayn, the male protagonist, with smoke coming from his mouth, and Gigi Hadid, the female lead, without; the short studs adorning a girl’s face later elongated into dangerous spikes because of an angry outburst; and an unorthodox boxing match between the deities of “war zone” and “paradise.”
These opposites symbolize the larger metaphorical struggles of gender constructs and relationship-defining pressures. Zayn is cast as the archetypal “bad boy” character. The girl, too, is somehow viewed by society as “dangerous” in her final outburst, due to abnormally long (only around one foot) spikes emerging from her skin in a symbolic gesture of her passionate emotions. War and paradise are pitted against one another, demonstrating relationships’ struggle between societal restriction and independent comfort. Tears of blood show the extremity of both male and female pain, and a female body attempting to escape a striped overlay obviously suggests a prison. With its sequences of color inverses and artful contrasts, “Pillowtalk” shows the flooring cost of social constrictions based on gender and all implications that accompany.
The video truly finds peace when it turns to images of a newfound middle ground. Nature plays a prominent role as flowers cover the screen, only to reappear later between a woman’s legs, showing that the true definition of gender lies only in communing with the natural world. This compromise is found elsewhere as the video progresses. Smoke travels between ungendered lips in an ultimate symbiosis, Gigi and Zayn morph into one another continuously, and Zayn’s profile transforms into a row of females kneeling into its shape.
This imagery displays the quality of male/female gender dynamics not as opposites on a binary but as conclusively similar societal constructs. The distortion of images and armies of Zayn’s and Gigi’s are evocative of the individual’s struggle to come to terms with the redefinition of gender and the pushback against wider norms. The lasting images of Zayn and Gigi making out seal the destruction of gender definition. Initially, Gigi appears on the right and Zayn on the left, but the final shot with Gigi on the left and Zayn on the right demonstrates their interchangeability. The video concludes that gender, relationship status, and probably the world itself are all social constructs.

In the age of iTunes and Spotify, it can be easy to think of a piece of music as a collection of 0s and 1s stored on a server thousands of miles away, readily accessible to anyone at any time on computers, cell phones, or even watches. Yet for most of music’s history, each performance of a piece occurred only at a particular place and time to a particular audience: Every incarnation of a composition was unique and irreproducible. In the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra’s performance of Beethoven’s “Eroica” and Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” on Friday, conductor Benjamin Zander and the young musicians brought into focus the sense of temporariness that used to be central to the experience of music. Their performances, brimming with vitality, proved them more than worthy of these two stirring pieces.
Though Beethoven’s symphony and Stravinsky’s ballet are two of the best-known pieces in the classical repertoire, Zander emphasized in his remarks before the concert that his audience would experience something new and unexpected. For the first time in the history of Boston’s Symphony Hall, BPYO performed “Eroica” exactly as Beethoven intended, following all the metronome notations on the original sheet music. Similarly, the orchestra strictly followed the tempi of “The Rite of Spring” as recorded by Stravinsky himself in his piano rolls, many of which posed enormous technical challenges to the musicians. The end of the piece, for instance, was so fast that even Stravinsky himself gave up on his original tempo when he rehearsed the piece’s premiere. BPYO, however, did not back away from it.
What BPYO presented was not just “Eroica” and “The Rite of Spring” but a specific version of them. Each piece became a unique experience shared only by the orchestra and the audience on Friday evening, and the performance inspired new ways of looking at the pieces. The last few minutes of Beethoven’s “Eroica,” for instance, were played significantly faster than in most performances of the composition. While the music sounded more exuberant and energetic, it also lacked the majestic elegance and triumphant solemnity that represent for many listeners not only the soul of the final movement but also the meaning of the symphony’s title—the “Sinfonia Eroica,” or “Heroic Symphony.” Whether this tempo felt more or less satisfying might depend on individual audience members’ preferences, but the performance unquestionably opened up a space in which the audience could hear Beethoven himself, marvel at his work, and wonder what he had in mind as he composed the piece.
“The Rite of Spring,” the second piece of the night, also sounded significantly different from its usual interpretations. While the benefits of obedience to the original tempo indications might be debatable in the case of “Eroica,” Zander’s decision to return to Stravinsky’s tempi unleashed the full power of the ballet. The overwhelming speed of some sections brought out the raw energy in the work of the then virtually unknown but ambitious composer. The orchestra explored the rich musical materials in the composition in a way that would be impossible to fully comprehend in a recording. The imposing drumbeats, the repeated violin chords, and the eerie bassoon solos wove together into a nebula of sound, at once dangerous, mysterious, exciting, intimidating, and irresistibly beautiful. The musicians’ mastery of such a challenging piece was impressive: Their youth, ambition, and drive were well-suited to the composition with which Stravinsky revolutionized Western music in the early twentieth century.
Both pieces received prolonged standing ovations from an audience that had braved new-fallen snow to attend the concert. The BPYO’s unique take on these classical music standards rendered their performance daring, engaging, and ultimately enchanting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was this freshman girl in my section last semester. But she wasn’t just any girl. She decided to do what very few girls have dared to do in my 21 years of life so far: talk to me.
She asked me what my concentration was and why I was taking the class. She asked me about my house and my roommates. She asked me about my activities and my writing. And, after class and her flurry of questions, I opened up my laptop to find a Facebook friend request waiting…from her.
Now, at first glance, this encounter could be interpreted as a minor flirtation. But we must keep in mind that I haven’t really received any flirtations since the Great Day of Love: May 8, 2009. That day, at approximately 1:47 p.m., Milea picked up my pen after I dropped it and handed it back to me in Spanish class. Milea and I never really talked before or after that encounter, but I will never forget her slight smile as whispered the suggestive phrase, “I think you dropped your pen.”
It’s been a number of years since I’ve experienced anything like the Great Day of Love. In fact, it’s been so long that I’ve become naturally skeptical of the presence of romance in any encounter, especially at Harvard: the place where Google calendars get more facetime than lovers.
Plus, the freshman from section seemed to be having the same conversations with a lot of kids in the class. It was easy to tell it wasn’t personal.
I was confused. But then, a few weeks later, a very distant thought occurred to me: maybe, just maybe, she was trying to make friends in class.
Friends in class?
Sure, back in the day, the “AP kids” at my high school were pretty tight. We hung out a lot, and they were there to comfort me when the football jock shoved me into my locker, when the gym teacher shoved me into my locker, and when Milea shoved me into my locker.
But college is different. The classes don’t meet every day. The students are from differing class years. Class sizes, especially for freshmen, are big. And the unaccountable attendance makes it seems like there’s a new group of students at each lectures.
Even when these structural difficulties are reduced, it’s tough meeting people, especially in classes without “collaborative” problem sets. Freshman year, I took two freshman seminars. There’s potential in that setting: small class size, all freshmen, professors that care about campus life, regular debate, and sharing of ideas. One of the seminars was even held in the quad, forcing us to take the shuttle back to the Yard together. Perfect!
But, after class, we’d sit in the shuttle, on our phones, pretending everyone else smelled bad. Then, the bus would park and we’d part ways.
I don’t know exactly what’s going on here. But it’s concerning.
Pretty often, I’ll hear a comment to this effect: “It’s impossible to make friends unless you like who you live with or you join a club.” I don’t think that sentiment is true, but the fact that it gets said implies there’s a problem. And there’s another something else that’s even more troubling: Loneliness, the real loneliness of having many people around and many things to do but no one to really be with, is a well-documented phenomenon on this campus.
To create a more tight-knit and less lonely community, let’s start at the place where stress looms large and friends are lacking: our classrooms.
In medium and small-sized classes, professors can make a better effort to learn student names, to develop not-purely-academic relationships with students, and to hold gatherings where people can talk about their lives, rather than just 13th-century Siberian poetry.
But we, the students, must do our part. And, really, it shouldn’t be all that hard.
In fact, it’s already being done. In my year, the Social Studies concentrators have organized parties in various dorms. As a result, they seem like a pretty tight group.
But I think the main solution doesn’t require so much organization. Small talk in section can lead to big talk about shared interests, which can lead to sitting down for lunch in Annenberg, which can lead to endless possibilities. The key is to maintain a culture of openness and friendliness that allows conversations to carry on beyond small talk. It sounds naïve, but I think it’s true: We need to be friendlier to one another.
These things are awkward only if you make them awkward. If I could go back, I wouldn’t act so perplexed by the friendly freshman in section. Rather, I’d engage with her in conversation more. I’d grab a meal with her. And, who knows? Maybe we’d hit up some kickbacks together.
Sure, I’m satisfied with my friend group as it is. But I also know that I don’t want this campus to be a place where you can feel alone in a section full of people. Students come to Harvard “for the people.” Now that we’re all here, it’s time to be together. It’s time to make friends.

A curve is a mystical machine that takes a 60% and ramps it up into an "A." Seemingly, then, a boon to students everywhere.
Yet, grades properly ought to reflect one thing, and one thing only: absolute mastery of material. At the heart of curve-based grading, on the other hand, is the enticing but pernicious premise that grades should instead reflect relative mastery of material; in particular, whether a student is on par with or lagging egregiously behind his peers.
In general, except under extreme applications of the scheme, nobody has reason to notice the problems underlying curve-based grading, and therefore nobody complains. Indeed, I’ve personally observed that many applications of the scheme are so thoughtfully implemented that the problems I’m about to list become practically nonexistent. Still, there’s always a potential for these problems to arise.
On the student-side, problems stem from the bare fact that students like high grades. At this point, a phenomenon of human nature comes into play, and can quickly turn class into a bizarre Keynesian beauty contest. The phenomenon is the same one at work when high schoolers obsess over which SAT date and test center to choose in order to obtain the most generous curve: If you dangle before people a reward for gaming the system, game it they will. The intentions implied behind flippant calls of "Everyone fail the test!" usually find themselves abandoned at home on exam day, but there is truth in the assertion that students think competitively in pursuit of high grades. Curve-based grading retards their education by diverting their effort from learning to finagling their transcripts.
Especially at top-tier institutions,
furthermore—where many students are accustomed to receiving high grades—when
learning and grades become disparate instead of directly interchangeable
metrics, students can be driven into a mercenary mindset and pursue grades
exclusively. In the absence of a curve, however, the two are inextricable. You’re forced to get all or none.
On the teacher-side, on the other hand, more severe problems arise from the fact that a curve obfuscates instructional feedback. It can become tough to readily perceive whether your students are learning effectively if you curve a 20% up to a perfect score and assign everyone "A’s." Whereas it’s only sometimes true that this discourages teachers from investing effort into their teaching, it is always true that this reduces pressure on teachers to expect mastery of material from their students.
This reduction of pressure on teachers to expect mastery can even, ironically, elevate pressure on students: Instead of painstakingly curating manageable syllabi or writing reasonable exams, teachers can set overwhelming syllabi or exams and then smooth things over with their pupils by curving everyone up. Students’ transcripts remain flawless at the end of the semester, so they of course don’t complain. But if they haven’t mastered the entire syllabus, what assurance do they have that they haven’t missed something crucial?
Curves, moreover, destroy comparability, as things that look the same end up different, and things that are different end up looking the same.
Specifically, individual students’ experiences in the very same course can end up different, as curves vary from section to section or year to year. This can complicate matters as students shop courses.
Along this same line, but opposite in effect, is the distortion that results in GPA, supposedly a standardized evaluative scale. Two different classes, one full of shiftless slackers and the other full of diligent geniuses, can appear equivalent. And, most concerning of all, a shiftless slacker can be curved up to become, at least GPA-wise, indistinguishable from a diligent genius within the same class. Because there’s no straightforward way to determine precisely which curve a particular student has faced, it’s natural for an observer to ignore the differences entirely.
The effect can be especially insidious when tasks for a class begin to verge upon the impossible—an exam that a teacher declares was never meant to be finished, for instance. Admittedly, the scenario is rare, but it reveals an interesting result of curve-based grading. Consider: In these cases, because the task is so infeasible, talent and effort can become obscured as the difficulty of earning an additional point increases exponentially, and therefore each additional point requires exponentially more talent and effort, while the visible payoff to score continues increasing only linearly. Because scores can then end up separated by a small distance, two students separated by a large degree of competence are likely to become lumped together by the curve.
I must emphasize that the blame for these faults doesn’t correctly belong with students or teachers; rather, the flaws are intrinsic to the curve-based grading scheme itself. Curve-based grading, then, is not the unmitigated blessing it might initially seem. Even if the scheme persists, these issues are worth considering as we use it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having previously faced criticism for its corporate culture, ever-expanding campus presence, and preferential treatment by the Harvard Library system, CS50 is now under scrutiny for trademarks that its instructor, David J. Malan ’99, filed personally. In 2011 and 2012, Malan submitted various trademark applications for his signature phrase “THIS IS CS50” and “CS50”—which were abandoned by Malan after Harvard filed to extend the opposition period—and created two limited liability companies associated with CS50. These details suggest that Malan may have aspired to create a CS50 franchise, according to Rebecca L. Tushnet ’95, a trademark expert at Georgetown Law School. Malan did not respond to requests for comment from The Crimson’s news writers about this possibility.
Aspirations of franchising a course run counter to a professor's duty as an instructor of a Harvard course. That position necessitates a vested interest in the education of Harvard undergraduates who enthusiastically enroll in the course rather than a commitment to the growth of a business and the creation of a trademark.
These actions also attest to the carte blanche Malan seemingly enjoys over CS50. Admittedly, Malan has invigorated CS50 and made it one of Harvard’s most popular courses. This success, however, does not justify Malan’s possessiveness over the course. While we are glad that he has consulted Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith in regards to trademark, we are concerned by the fact that he filed them personally to begin with. He, like any other course instructor, is working in that capacity as an employee of Harvard. Regardless of performance and innovation, no professor’s compensation should involve any special entitlement to the course itself, and therefore, no professor should be able to privatize, put to his own ends, or trademark a course. This practice directly conflicts with the ideals of a liberal arts education.
This point, however, does not imply that Harvard employees should purely serve Harvard and disregard their private ends. For instance, University President Drew G. Faust is on the Board of Directors of Staples and psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert has appeared in Prudential Financial commercials. But there is a key difference between these actions and Malan’s: The activities do not constitute an attempt to commercialize a Harvard class. They are well within the bounds of private action.
In contrast, Malan’s attempts to trademark CS50 intermingle his obligation to his students as a professor and his own goals for the course’s expansion. The secretive nature of his trademark applications is of particular concern to us: Malan’s second LLC, 50 LLC, is registered under a private address in Boston rather than his official address on Harvard’s campus, suggesting a degree of secrecy furthered by the fact that Harvard filed to extend the opposition period to his trademark applications shortly before the deadline.
CS50’s expansion to Yale last year seemed like an unprecedented triumph for the spirit of collaboration that a liberal arts philosophy promotes. The recent revelation of Malan’s attempt to trademark the course, however, suggests a motivation beyond academic exploration fueling CS50’s rise. The desire to franchise a Harvard class conflicts with Harvard’s central liberal mission, which trumps the value of any one course—even that of CS50. After all, this is not CS50. This is Harvard.

To the editor:
As one of the Harvard Law School alums interviewed and quoted in your February 9, 2016 article “Law School Alumni Divided over Activism on Campus,” I was surprised and disappointed that the article failed to mention Dean Minow’s extraordinary record, both past and present, in promoting racial, ethnic and gender diversity at the school. Since the start of her tenure as dean, the percentage of students of color enrolling at HLS has increased every year—from approximately 33 percent of the class in 2009 to 44 percent in 2015—and for the first time in the history of the school, the percentage of female students in an entering class reached 50 percent under her tenure. A quick review of the University’s annual Faculty Development and Diversity Reports shows that the number of ethnic minority faculty members (tenure and tenure-track) at HLS has also climbed 50 percent in the six years of her deanship—from 10 the year she became Dean to 15 last year—and there have been additional appointments adding to faculty diversity this year not yet reflected in the University reports.
Unless and until the identity and motive of the coward responsible for the vandalism of portraits of the law school’s black professors is established, the ugly event cannot itself be read as evidence that racism exists at HLS. But given that systemic racism plagues our nation at large and is pervasive in so many institutions, I am grateful that the event has triggered important reflection, discussion, and debate on campus regarding racial issues, and I am especially grateful to the Dean for facilitating that debate and discussion and taking action on numerous fronts to address concerns that have been raised, e.g., appointing a committee of faculty, alumni, and students to explore whether HLS should continue to use the Royall shield, revising the incoming JD orientation program to focus more on issues of diversity and inclusion, and exploring ways to improve inclusion and advancement for staff.
It is in very large part because of Dean Minow’s longstanding and unrivaled efforts to diversify HLS and to make social justice one of the school’s most fundamental endeavors that I and many other alums are enthusiastic donors to the school. Understanding that financial aid and low-income protection plans are critical to her mission to attract, enroll and support talented students from diverse backgrounds, Minow has throughout her tenure made raising funds for these aid programs a top priority. As a national leader on issues of access to justice, she has been a leading proponent for new and innovative ways to provide legal assistance for the growing numbers of poor and indigent people unable to afford it otherwise.
Any article about activism at HLS should include at least some reporting on the most prominent, committed, and effective activist on its campus—Dean Martha Minow herself.

My nose tingles as I press it against my living room’s wall-sized window pane. Less than an inch of glass separates six-year-old me from freezing December temperatures. My excited panting fogs the window, and I—contrary to the standing orders of my parents to keep my hands off of windows—pull my head back slightly and begin to draw shapes.
First comes the square, then the triangle on top. A house. Exhale. Rectangles and squiggly circles form trees. Exhale. Stick figures spring up. Exhale. A smiling sun appears. Exhale.
I exhale again, this time in impatience. Where is he? If six-year-old me is anything, he is punctual. To me, 8:30 means 8:30, and it is already 8:42. Forehead against the glass, I continue to man my post overlooking the driveway. Out on the street, headlights flash. Managing my expectations—you know, as six-year-olds do—I wait to see if the headlights turn towards my house. They do, and excitement instantly replaces grumpiness. I wave my arms wildly, bouncing with anticipation. Two short honks sound from the garage, and I race to the door.
I yank it open, and Dad is in the doorway. His briefcase looks heavy and his eyes look tired, but he flashes a huge smile and scoops me up for a hug. I cling to him tightly until he manages to shake me off. As we walk towards the kitchen, my motor mouth is off to the races.
“Today-I-got-up-and-read-two-books-and-then-I-ate-lunch-and-then-Mommy-said-I-could-play-video-games-so-I-did-that-and-then-I-played-with-Martin-and-we-had-dinner-and-Mommy-saved-you-some-and-put-it-over-the-stove,” I blurt in one breath.
Dad smiles again. “That all sounds great,” he says, taking the plate down from the shelf. “Dinner looks great too.”
I plop myself down at the kitchen table as Dad starts eating.
“Ooh, I almost forgot!” Dad reaches into his pocket. “This is it, Andj. I can feel it.”
He hands me a Powerball ticket, explaining that he buys one whenever he stops for gas on the way home from work. As I study it intently, Dad transitions into life-lessons mode, emphasizing that buying a lot of lottery tickets is a huge waste of money and can’t replace an honest living. I nod solemnly as he gives his spiel—spieling is not uncommon for Dad—but look up to see amusement take the place of the weariness in his eyes.
“But how cool would it be if we did win, Andj?” he jokes, returning to his dinner.
We didn’t win that lottery. Over the last 13 years, we have not won any of the dozens of lotteries that Dad has entered. As part of our commitment to the joke, Dad and I always feign surprise and disappointment. This past winter, when the Powerball was approaching $1 billion, Dad proclaimed, “This is it, everyone!” But in a twist that shocked us both, we lost that one too.
Dad has continued to go to work early and get home late. His briefcase has continued to look heavy, and his eyes still look tired. He still scoops me in for a hug every time he sees me, though I grew to exceed the weight limit of the picking-up portion a long time ago. And when I call home from college, he still listens to my motor mouth.
As I sit on my bed and resist the urge to draw shapes on my dorm window, I know that, while I may not have won the Powerball, I did end up winning the lottery.

“I officially rode the entire Red Line today as of this second,” a recent Facebook post from Dalen L. Ferreira ’19 reads. Ferreira describes the Harvard to Ashmont, Braintree to Alewife journey in detail. “All that fun for $2.10!!!!!!”
“Gonna go finish up the orange line in about 25 minutes... anyone care to join me?” another post asks.
For Ferreira, this is just part of another weekend spent enjoying the sights—and sounds—of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
“I know a lot of people don’t like that metallic screeching sound—I don’t know, I kind of like it,” Ferreira confesses when we meet.
While most students take Boston public transit simply to get from point A to point B, Ferreira rides the T for pleasure. The Sayville, N.Y. native first took the T during Visitas last April, and enjoyed it so much that he’s made it his mission to explore every corner of the subway tracks. Before winter break, he rode the entirety of the Red and Blue Lines, covered most of the Orange Line, and took a day trip to Providence.
“It’s a good way to get out of Harvard for a while, especially if you’re stressed about work, which I personally haven’t been too much,” Ferreira says. “But if you’re really stressed out, bring a book on there and read for a while. It could maybe give you inspiration.”
For Ferreira, that inspiration often comes in the form of musical patterns he hears on the train. As a member of the Harvard University Band, Ferreira counts listening to his surroundings as one of the major draws of public transit. “I’m getting to a point where I can hear certain things and I can recognize similarities along the route,” Ferreira says. He is currently brainstorming ways to turn those repetitions into music.
The MBTA connoisseur has hung several authentic T signs in his Canaday single. One, a 12-foot-long artifact of the Green Line, was a Christmas gift from his girlfriend back home. Another is a decommissioned commuter rail sign that he happened upon at the MBTA warehouse.
After some initial surprise, Ferreira’s six suitemates warmed up to the signs. “They thought [the T sign] was ridiculous and large, but then we actually used it to measure some things in the common room because we couldn’t find a tape measure,” Ferreira says.
Many of Ferreira’s friends, his suitemates included, are perplexed by his hobby. “A lot of people don’t seem to understand the pleasure of riding trains,” he says.
“People think it’s dirty, which, yeah, but just [use] hand sanitizer,” Ferreira says.
Members of the 2019 Facebook group can expect to see more of Ferreira’s travel updates on their news feeds. This semester, he hopes to travel to Brunswick, Maine, finish the Orange Line (which he calls “filthy”), and complete the B, C, and D branches of the Green Line.
Ferreira takes longer trips with friends or Facebook enlistees for safety reasons, but prefers to travel alone on a daily basis. “I find myself to be kind of an observant person where occasionally, like early morning, I want to just get on and think,” Ferreira explains. During these adventures, he thinks about music and plans future train trips.
For Ferreira, time on the T is never wasted. “If you have to spend time watching an hour of YouTube videos that are really not going to benefit you at all, or living in your surroundings for an hour—for a decent price, too—then I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to just go,” he says.

Back home in Indiana, I live next to an old woman who sometimes makes me instant coffee. She stirs it up in a mug after heating water in her microwave. A recent inductee to the ancient tribe of widowhood, her only real company these days is a sumptuous, embittered Chihuahua with wild rolling eyes. It yips and snarls and goes cross-eyed, looking dumber than a drawer of socks.
When winter came, creeping, snow and bournes of clouded ice covered the sidewalks. I walked out onto my porch one morning, and felt the light strike my eyes in a peculiar way. The large oak that had shaded my neighbor’s home had split in half, its miraculous fall having, somehow, completely avoided the house. It had settled in an empty lot, its limbs for the most part unbroken, as though its decline had been gentle, gradual. Like a thicket of frozen lightning, its branches hung above the snowy ground. No one had heard the fall.
Had the tree struck my neighbor’s home—which, I remember now, was once the home of a casket-maker, many years ago—that would have been it. A pile of wood and splinters, and somewhere within it a woman and her dog. But my neighbor didn’t consider that idea. Instead, she mourned the tree. It was beautiful, she said. The whole street used to be beautiful, especially in the springtime. I used to sit on my porch and watch the leaves.
Just a few days ago, I was down by the Charles and saw another fallen tree. One of the main boughs had split under the teasing pressure of snow, but for whatever reason this had been a violent fall. Mangled branches mingled with the earth, pawing up brown furrows that dirtied the snow. Grey-yellow streaks of inner wood gleamed in the strong sun. A single heavy bough, almost vertical, had slammed into the ground. Lacking any smaller minor branches, the bough looked sinister, as though it were a battering ram, as though it had been designed to hurt.
The scene reminded me of the tree back home, of the fall that hadn’t been a fall, but a curtsy of sorts, the tree like an old woman who’d overestimated her limberness. There had been groaning, surely, in the snow-muffled air of night, the softest protestation as flexion turned to breakage. But beyond that, I couldn’t picture the fall, the bending arc, the details of the scene. It had occurred in silence, beggaring certain natural laws. Perhaps it was this impossibility that caused me to wonder what might have been had the trees been switched.
It wasn’t so much that the actual trees in their physical entireties needed to take each others’ places. The factors determining the specifics of their falls were so small and manifold, so completely incalculable, that a point of snow could have done it. Had a flake fallen here and not there, had the breeze veered right or left or kept on full bore, had a bird nested further down the trunk—then we might be seeing on the banks of the Charles, right now, a tableau of dainty destruction, and back home in Indiana, a month or so ago, I would have seen a wreckage, a mad arborescence of limbs and doilies and glass and spilled coffee, within which a little old lady lay on her bed like a bier, trapped in the dark, an unyipping Chihuahua by her side.

Ventfull, a smartphone app designed to cure FOMO at Harvard through an interactive, easily scrollable calendar of events, was discontinued by the Undergraduate Council in early February. Somewhere, a baby cried. I joined the baby.
Everything I needed used to be one pudgy fingertip away. Now, finding events takes about 15 pudgy, soft, oily fingertip squishes on my smartphone’s Safari app. One should not have to use more than five turgid, moist, smudgy, pudgy, fingertip pokes. Isn’t that what this generation is all about?
Oh Ventfull, you made my life so much easier, and now you are gone with the wind—the movie from my DVD collection that I lost a long time ago. You have been ripped from my side by your creator, the UC, who giveth and taketh away. Not enough money, they say. Not enough coding possibilities in the app, they say. Not enough use, they say. They say a lot of things, and the weight of the world only grows heavier on me.
To put this in simple terms: Ventfull was the child of Former UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16. Newly elected UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 gave up on it. Danny and Shaiba gave up on a child.
Yesterday, when the site officially went down, I was so filled with FOMO that I could hardly move. Finally, I rolled out of bed. Brushed my teeth. Brushed my hair. Ate breakfast. Went to class. Did homework. Talked to friends. Ate dinner. Watched TV. Realized I missed lunch. Re-realized I didn’t have Ventfull. Was paralyzed with paroxysms of FOMO.
FOMO: Fear of Missing Otters. Where are the otters?  My favorite part of Ventfull was its interactive map showing location, weight, density of fur, temperature, and top speed of all of Cambridge’s otters. Now, it’s so much harder to know where Harvard’s otters are. So, I’m back to sonar monitoring like a chump who wasn’t born with a silver, otter-shaped spoon in his mouth.
And how am I supposed to meet people now? Where am I supposed to go? I wandered the Yard and pondered these questions. I looked around and everyone seemed to be in the same state of disbelief. Heads down, all scowls, looking at their phones, frantically clicking the Ventfull icon. “It’ll be okay, everyone,” I yelled. “Ventfull’s second coming will be soon.”
“Shut up,” someone yelled back. Hoi polloi, they’d already given up all hope.
Then, another question occurred to me. Without Ventfull, are there even events? Maybe now there can only be chaotic gatherings of people. Like Neanderthals around the burning husk of a mammoth, we lack Ventfull. Like the looters of a Walmart, we lack Ventfull. Like Mussolini and his chanting crowds, we lack Ventfull. Like savage otters, we lack Ventfull.
To make matters worse, in a world without Ventfull, I’ll even have problems with dating. What am I supposed to do with my prospective beaus? Ventfull and Chill was my go to move.
Eulogic reader, you too will have problems. Imagine, it’s Friday night. The club is bumping. Your favorite DJ is playing. You are singing along and actually remembering all the lyrics to the song. Someone compliments you on your dancing, so you give an extra kick, flip, twirl at the next drop. But deep down, you know that there might be a student play you are missing or an IOP event that all your friends are going to be talking about. Doesn’t the music sound hollow now? Doesn’t the drink taste stale? Can there be “fun” after Ventfull?
All we can do now is wait. Wait for Ventfull’s successor. And pray: “O, O, UC, who giveth and taketh, giveth me and mine a way to find events with ice cream and taketh away the loneliness coiled around my mortal coil which wants to be coiled around a Harvard funded event.”

Dear Roommate,
We’ve  had some good times together, I won’t deny that. Last semester was chock full of cherished memories. If I could do it again, there’s nothing I would change. But we went away for winter break, and things are different now. You know they are. I see you denying it. I see you averting your eyes as you walk by, but this is real and something we need to talk about if we’re going to move forward as a room. I know it’s going to hurt. I know you’d rather just ignore it. But you need to hear this.
Your plant is dead.
It was real fun when you bought it. We all felt so adult having some honest-to-goodness living foliage in our room. People came in and marveled. It even helped us in our romantic endeavors, impressing upon all manner of guests that we were mature, quirky, and responsible. I came to think of the plant as I would think of a close friend.
That was last semester. This is now. What was once a verdant testament to the lusciousness of nature is now a shriveling, decrepit husk, shedding its carcass all over our common room. And no, it doesn’t “still look all right.” It looks dead. It’s brown and crumbly, and now when people walk in and see it, they think that we’re filthy slobs who can’t keep a simple little plant alive. For at least one of us, they’re quite right.
What is to be done, you ask? How can we possibly overcome this tragedy that has befallen us? Is there any way that we can band together and soldier on?
Yes. Yes. Of course there is. You can throw the damn thing out. I cannot possibly believe that you haven’t thought of that. I can’t fathom a world in which you walk by our resident corpse everyday and think to yourself, “Nothing to be done here.” And I’m sorry, the environment doesn’t give a shit that you want to “return it to nature.” The coal companies won’t look at you and reconsider their actions. Just put it in a bag, and throw it in the bin.
To recap: Your plant is dead. Clean up after yourself.
Best,
Your Loving Roommate

Even as we mourn the loss of the UC’s once-hyped app Ventfull—which, let’s be honest, none of us used anyway—FM is hard at work thinking up some new apps that would help us with the real Harvard struggles. CS50 Fair next year, anyone?
Occupied
Forget the old-fashioned sock on the door; this app is the only way to survive life in a double. You will be alerted when your roommate is getting it on with his or her significant other/random hook-up buddy, sparing you awkward and unwanted encounters.
CoastIsClear
Don’t deny it—we all reach for our phones to avoid an awkward run-in on the walk from Widener Gate to the Science Center. Sometimes, though, pretending to text just isn’t enough. Whether you’re hoping for a run-in with the guy you hooked up with last week (or desperately trying to avoid him), CoastIsClear has you covered. Input your destination and who you do/don’t want to see, and this app will map out the perfect route for you. Who cares if it takes you out of your way and you end up at the Quad on your way from Sever to Barker? Worth it.
HUDSify
God forbid you should have to to eat alone in the dhall, marooned at table C10 hoping to make eye contact with that one FOP buddy you haven’t seen in months. HUDSify will send official-looking email documents straight to your phone, so you can pretend to do work while you eat your solitary bowl of Cracklin’ Oats. It will also let you know how long the line is at Annenberg, so you can avert the post-Ec10 stampede.
UnTagMe
There are few things worse than getting a notification that you’ve been tagged in three pictures from last night, none of which you remember taking. This app automatically untags you from those embarrassing photos (read: a picture of you kissing a taxidermied bear while dancing on a table).
MarketDash
Market in the Square has all your heart’s desires wrapped up in a tortilla, but getting there takes that critical extra minute of walking that you’re just not willing to spend. This app will deliver your favorite sandwich, wrap, or snack from Market to your room, 24 hours a day. For a minimal extra fee, you can request a personal delivery from Rigo himself.
Proctr
We’ve all trekked from Winthrop to DeWolfe to Mather only to arrive there and share an elevator ride with an angry tutor ready to shut down the party. This app will update you in real time with proctor alerts from around campus, so you can save both your disappointment and your precious time.

I’ve always been clumsy.
One of the earliest memories I have (I have very few, for some reason) is of falling down a flight of stairs after missing a step. I was about five years old, and I don’t recall what happened afterwards. Maybe I got concussed—which would explain the gaps in my childhood memories. Two left feet, my mom would tease me. Trip, fall, stumble, I did them all. My legs moved in opposite directions, as though rebelling against my body. My family—myself included—all laughed at the incredible lack of coordination gifted to me.

But what began as a joke quickly became, quite literally, my Achilles’ heel. Maybe it was because, as I saw my especially athletic sister play the violin with such finesse, my sibling rivalry kicked in. During elementary and middle school, while we all awkwardly went through the painful phase of puberty and cooties, I faced another form of embarrassment: cross-country. As we ran, I would steal a furtive glance at the fast runners on the team, admiring the pure speed at which their legs moved, and then trip on a miniscule object like a pebble. The brutal jokes flowed in, infused with the nastiness that only middle schoolers are capable of. Of course you’re such a klutz; you’re a tiny, unathletic Asian who only studies and plays the clarinet! (Little did they know I was forced to choose the clarinet because, according to my parents, I was too uncoordinated for the violin or the piano—more glamorous instruments, in my opinion.)
I tried to shed my awkward self behind, like a lizard shedding skin. I “tilted my tailbone forward” in yoga (fainted in the middle of it), pushed my legs “to the rhythm” at SoulCycle (though apparently stationary bikes don’t do much for coordination), and even rowed in high school (I got kicked off to cox instead). The pattern continued at college. I tripped my way through Harvard Yard—Hurricane Nemo and all. Endearingly, my boyfriend at the time compared me to a penguin. But still, the summer after freshman year, I promised myself that I would finally transform and got a gym membership. On the first day, I hopped on the treadmill, tripped, and broke my ankle. I had to get surgery and was confined to a wheelchair for a couple of weeks.
Farce became tragedy. I had largely given up on the idea of being athletic (or at least not clumsy) when I landed in Berlin last summer. But oh, the beautiful, kaleidoscopic bikes that lined up on the city’s streets! The glamour of people letting their hair loose in the wind as they pedaled! I was utterly smitten. Maybe this would be my way of conquering my awkward limbs. I mean, you only have to move them in one direction, right?
It felt especially serendipitous that the subject of my thesis, Marcel Duchamp, had chosen a bicycle as the subject of one of his artworks. Maybe I forgot the crucial fact that he actually removed one of the wheels and mounted it in a subversive act, totally mutilating the bike.
I became obsessed with the idea of biking. I looked at countless ads on eBay and Craigslist. But the bikes were all too tall for me—figures, given that the average height of Germans is quite a few inches greater than that of Koreans. I visited every single bike shop near me to no avail. Only when I finally made it out to one of the flea markets did I find a perfect bike—small, blue, functional.
Did I mention that I didn’t know how to ride a bike?
So there I was—in a foreign city, with a newly purchased bike that I didn’t know how to ride. I awkwardly attempted to ride it home, but got caught by a stern old German grandpa. He sighed and pulled me over. He scolded me in German: “Do you even know how to ride a bike?” Suddenly I was a timid seven-year-old, caught sneaking chocolate from the cabinet. I replied quietly, “Nein…” He ordered me to get back on the bike and screamed, “Faster, faster, faster! Your fear is what’s stopping you!” Cue cliché.
I obliged, and forced my legs to move faster. And voilà came the balance—it was like magic. I was biking.
But eventually, I grew too arrogant. I felt empowered, like the French women of the 20th century who biked around as a form of emancipation. I could actually ride the bike and appear coordinated. I, too, let my hair loose. Helmets were for tourists. At the same time, I let my inner New Yorker reveal itself, aggressively biking when the light turned orange (orange means go faster, not stop) and cutting in front of cars. I was rebelling—against my own clumsy body and probably my sensibilities, too. I could practically hear my worried mom screaming in disapproval.
One day, I felt empowered enough that I thought I could take on a car. I biked down Unter den Linden, one of the most notoriously busy streets in Berlin. A car beside me drove exasperatingly close, and more slowly than the other cars—almost like two people who hold hands and don’t let you walk by them in a narrow street. I decided to bike past it, and sped up. Ha! I was ahead of it in a manner of seconds. I let my legs turn, turn, turn—and the next thing I knew, I was on the side of the road with my bike sprawled far away from me. I had failed to notice a speed bump in the frenzy; it sent me flying and straight to the ground.
What followed afterwards is hazy due to an actual, confirmed concussion. I remember somebody helping me into a cab to the nearest hospital. When I arrived, I needed to pay 150 euros in cash because I wasn’t a German citizen and I wasn’t  dying in front of their eyes. Excuse me? I felt like vomiting, and my vision blurred. I walked to the nearest ATM, which was broken. I started crying. My phone, which broke in the accident, signaled to me with ominous black-and-white vertical stripes across the screen that it wouldn’t last long. I sent quick texts to the people who matter: my mom, my friends in the study abroad program, and a Harvard grad who’s a native here.
When I finally got settled in a nice hospital bed after a series of x-rays and unpleasant proddings, another doctor entered. The doctor, who checked on me every two hours for the next day, asked me if I wore a helmet during the crash. When I sheepishly said no, he stared at me blankly. He asked me why. Do I tell him of my clumsy past, and the insecurities driving the false arrogance? Isn’t that what half of Harvard is like, anyway? That constant self-doubting beneath the façade of perfection?
I did’t say anything. When the doctor finally left, my hospital roommate, an elderly lady, remarked: “It’s okay, that’s how we used to do it during the Cold War.” She’s from the former German Democratic Republic, the eastern bloc of divided Germany.
Great. We all know how that turned out.

Twenty Harvard Law School graduates have gone on to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, so it isn’t a stretch to imagine that current students will one day follow. But before reaching The Highest Court in the Land, in all likelihood, Law School students will first stop by The Highest Court in the Building.
That’s the term students have coined for the basketball court on the top floor of the Law School’s Hemenway Gymnasium, which has been graced by law school legends ranging from Barack Obama to Ted Cruz and continues to serve as a sort of second home for some students.
“It’s a different type of vibe,” says third-year Law student Jonathan Wall (no relation to the NBA player of the same name), who is on the court more days than not. “It’s something about the gym being small. You’re kind of forced to know everyone who comes in there. That’s one of the main things that make it special.”
Hemenway’s court conjures up flashbacks to basketball’s earlier days. The sub-regulation-sized court’s lines run just feet from the gym’s bare white walls. The three point lines are a hop step from half court, and two massive box fans unsuccessfully attempt to make up for a lack of air conditioning in the warmer months.
But the aesthetics aren’t the only old school thing about Hemenway: Games get chippy. You only call a foul if you mean it. First to 18, twos and threes. Always full-court.
“That’s the way it’s always been,” Wall says.
President Barack Obama is said to have been a Hemenway regular—by some accounts, he laced up once or twice a week; by others, nearly every day.
“He had a decent shot, could drive to the basket and had good reach,” says Seth Farber ’86, who graduated from the Law School in 1989, overlapping with Obama for a year. “Interestingly, his demeanor in those games was similar to his demeanor now. He was one of the more level-headed, even tempered players.”
“If there was any knock against Barack, he pulled his socks up a little too high and his shorts were a little too small,” actor Hill Harper, a close friend of Obama’s from Harvard, once told the Dallas Morning News. “We were just at the beginning of the Michael Jordan era. He more harkened back to the Julius Erving era.”
Ted Cruz, not exactly known for his similarities to President Obama, lived next door to Hemenway, and also frequented the court for intramural basketball and volleyball.
All this history might not be immediately obvious to someone stepping into Hemenway for the first time. The gym has gotten several facelifts since it was built in 1938, including one last winter.
“Everything looked really new to me since I stepped in there, so I never thought about the history,” Wall says. “But you look at the list of alumni, there’s no way they didn’t step in the gym at least once and play basketball.”
The current group of regulars, which coordinates through GroupMe, now looks to continue that legacy.
Wall, from Raleigh N.C., attended Morehouse College and the Harvard Graduate School of Education before law school and said he initially struggled to find the time to play basketball before cementing it as a priority.
“A lot of times, it could seem so crazy that I spend this time not in the study room,” Wall says. “But basketball means that much to me and this group of guys, too.”
For many students, the gym also serves as a respite from the lecture rooms and laborious routines at Harvard.
“All these guys: I’ve been in heated battles against them and with them by my side,” Wall says. “That just brings people together in a more organic way than some of the artificial things that you see in the Law School, like clubs and organizations to put on your resume.”
“Basketball is basketball. But it was the people that made the experience unique,” Tristan Threatt ’18 tells me. “You’re able to listen to the guys who are there and learn from their experiences.”
That said, in many ways, the nuances of play are vintage Harvard Law. On the sidelines, players waiting for the next game can often be heard discussing summer jobs and classes. And occasionally someone will try to use legal jargon to explain things happening on the court (e.g. “the presumption of that call…”).
In his first year, Wall recalls, a middle-aged man was “calling crazy fouls,” and they got into a bit of a scuffle. Some of the older Law students, horrified, pulled Wall aside and told him to cool down. The man was renowned Law professor Noah Feldman.
But ultimately, Hemenway is about more than its history and transcends the day-to-day grind of Harvard.
“When people ask me where I’ve found my roots in the Law School,” Wall says, “it’s a difficult question to answer, because I actually feel like it’s in Hemenway in the gym with those guys.”
He adds, “The earlier you realize that it’s more than just pickup basketball, the more fun you’ll have.”

“Would you like to share your dreams today?” A waiter greeted me as I stepped into the tiny restaurant. A couple of friends and I had Ubered over to Porter Square’s hole-in-the-wall ramen restaraunt, Yume Wo Katare. Translated literally from Japanese, the name means “Talk about your dreams.”

Before making it inside, we waited in line for 40 minutes in the freezing cold. As we huddled together to keep warm, a server came by to say hello and asked if we would like to share a long- or short-term dream. He quickly explained that Yumo Wo Katare is trying to make it into the Guinness Book of World Records by breaking the record for “Most Dreams Shared In a Year.” The record currently stands at 10,000 dreams.
I nodded eagerly, received a bright orange “I Have a Dream” card, and was asked what I wanted to eat. The choice was simple: ramen or more ramen. There is something to be said about a restaurant that serves only one dish and still consistently attracts a long line of customers. I went with ramen, which comes with two (rather than five) pieces of pork.
After ordering, we were seated at the second row of three wooden counters. The walls around us were decorated with framed dreams of previous patrons. As a soccer aficionado, one caught my eye: A previous visitor dreamed of “chang[ing] the world through soccer.”
We received our “bowls of dreams” and didn’t wait a second to start slurping away. I’ve found that the the key to an awesome bowl of ramen is the broth —­too salty, and the bowl is immediately messed up. But Yume has got it down to an art; they served broth that is well-seasoned and tasty and filled with slices of delectably tender pork. Coiled within was a generous serving of noodles, which had ben cooked to perfection. Heed this warning, though: Don’t bring a date to Yume. Ramen is an inherently messy meal, and you’ll leave feeling very satisfied, but very splattered.

During our meal, we were periodically interrupted by fellow patrons who stood up, told us their names, and proudly proclaimed that this was their tenth, 55th, or, in our case, first time eating at Yume. They then declared their dreams before returning to their noodles.
The ultimate goal at Yume Wo Katare is to have your bowl dubbed “perfect” by servers who move from row to row inspecting finished bowls. You may only receive the coveted “perfect” evaluation if you finish absolutely everything in your bowl—broth, bean sprouts, noodles, and pork. You can also receive a “good job,” “almost,” or an optimisitc “next time.” The accolades encourage diners to reduce food waste, and introduce a fun, quasi-competitive element to the meal.
Miranda F. Tyson ’18, a former employee, says the dream-sharing doesn’t stop with customers. “Before every shift, we all had to share our goal for that day, our goal for that month, and our goal for the following six months,” she says. “Other employees were encouraged to ask questions so that the goal-sharer was forced to think more about how they were to accomplish their goals within that time-frame.”
This created an environment “in which I felt like I was continuously being encouraged,” Tyson says. The supportive environment extends to customers as well. During our visit, dream-sharers were met with enthusiastic hoots and cheers.

They come in swarms, the kids, and bring with them reminders of their youth and everyone else’s mortality. A makeshift crown, fashioned from red construction paper and protruding staples. A ballerina tutu of fraying sheer pink nylon. A high-pitched cry. A plastic hand drum.
I feel both nostalgic and pained here, watching families pass me by with only a cursory glance or, sometimes, an astute observation or two. “Look at those beautiful women!” exclaims one mother, tugging her toddler’s arm and pointing behind my head. He frowns and hiccups as she speaks in the third person. “They look like Mom when she has her hair pinned back!”
I’m standing in front of the Museum of Fine Art’s latest acquisition, a Frida Kahlo painting—the first Kahlo ever sold and the first of hers to enter a New England public collection. “Dos Mujeres (Salvadora y Herminia),” from 1928, portrays two Mexican maids whom Kahlo had known since childhood and who had worked for many years in her mother’s house. Both women stare at some object not featured, their gazes directed toward the left side of frame. Their black locks are woven in long, thick braids. There’s a clear age discrepancy between the two: The woman in the foreground is younger, with hoop earrings, trimmer brows, plumper lips. The other maid wears her age in the bags beneath her eyes, in her tauter skin, her wrinkles.
For what feels like hours, I walk in and around the vicinity of the painting—listening to, and learning from, visitors. One couple stays for nearly as long as I do, discussing the foliage that forms the backdrop to Salvadora and Herminia’s profiles. “Those are Communist symbols!” the husband says of the butterflies floating in the scenery. “Those are lemons!” claims his wife. While they argue, a mother and adolescent daughter arrive, the former fanny-pack-adorned and the latter wincing. The mother insists on taking a selfie. Though her teen refuses to participate, she remains steadfast; grinning, sweating, humming. She continues like this, exhibiting public displays of unreciprocated affection until, finally: “Diego was a dick to Frida, you know, Stacey? Good thing I’m not like that to you.”
Later, I discover that the reverse side of Kahlo’s painting tells a story, too, when a few members of Boston University’s rugby team point out as much.  Beneath “Dos Mujeres” lies a note from the curator, explaining the painting’s first acquisition. One night in July 1929, at her home in Coyoacán, Kahlo sold the work for three pesos to Jackson Cole Phillips, an engineer and industrialist from New York. Kahlo commemorated the event on the back of her canvas, calling it “a most enjoyable evening with the author of the painting.” She inscribed her name, the date, and location underneath this commentary. Kahlo even asked her guests, witnesses to the deal, to add their signatures as well. And so it was that Kahlo’s sister Cristina, her future husband Diego Rivera, and other Mexican luminaries put their pen to the prized paper. “Dos Mujeres” remained a possession of the Phillips family until the MFA purchased it last month.
“I recognize those eyebrows.” A young woman, sporting a gray beanie and a nose ring, interrupts my conversation with the rugby players. She points to the older maid in the painting, the one with bushes arching toward the middle of her forehead. A museum staffer intervenes and tells her that “Dos Mujeres” isn’t “some time-lapsed self-portrait.” The girl looks down at her Doc Martens, embarrassed. “Well,” she says, pointing now at the black cloth hanging from the older maid’s arm, “maybe that’s an abyss, and maybe Frida’s in it.”
There are a few nods, some murmurs. Before any real objections can be made, I leave for the contemporary art exhibit, left to wonder if, perhaps, that abyss is big enough for us all.

Stumbling into Market in the Square at 2 a.m., you need to sate your munchies. You order a Grand Canyon, pick up a bag of popcorn and a Diet Coke, throw it all down on the check-out counter, and pull out your credit card. It’s a Saturday night, and you’d think that the very last thing that should be on your mind is the man who rings you up behind the register. You’d think wrong.
His name is Rigo, he works the night shift, and he is Instagram famous.

“I know you,” Rigo says to me with a smile as I approach the counter. “I saw you messaged me, and I was like, ‘I remember you.’” I’ve been to Market before, but I’ve never spoken to Rigo. I’m impressed.
He invites me to come sit on the ledge behind the counter. He has to work, so he continues helping customers as we begin to chat about his life.
 
I learn that Rigoberto Marcus-Perez was born in Cuernavaca, Mexico. When he was only seven years old, his father left his family. His mother provided for Rigo, his two brothers, and his two sisters.
When he was halfway through high school, Rigo decided to join the Mexican army. A couple months later, he moved to America.
Rigo and five of his friends visited the U.S. Embassy, applied for Visas, and headed to Chicago. He didn’t even tell his mother he was leaving.
“I remember, same day I arrived, same day I started working,” Rigo recalls. After having lunch at a Cuban-Puerto Rican restaurant, he decided to ask the manager if the place was hiring. The man replied, “You’re 15. Are you serious? You wanna work?’” Rigo got a job doing the dishes in the back, where he rarely saw the light of day.
After the first week, Rigo received his first paycheck of only $250, but he worked his way up the ranks, eventually increasing his weekly paycheck.
After two years of sending money back home to support his family, Rigo decided to go back to Mexico, though his stay was short-lived. Four months into working at a farm in his native country, he decided to return to the States and assume a position at a produce market in New Jersey.

A few years later, Rigo’s uncles moved to America and invited him to come work in Boston—well, Harvard Square. He found a job at Market, and he soon became well known for his craft.
He’s also well known for his social media presence. With 483 followers on Instagram, many of whom are Harvard undergraduates, Rigo is a bit of a celebrity on campus. “I started to be friends with people I never expected,” he says. “Friends” doesn’t even tell the whole story.
While many Harvard students spend their Friday nights lamenting the college’s dearth of social spaces, Rigo’s nights are “crazy.” Known to pay visits to final clubs and promote Harvard’s sororities on Facebook, Rigo’s relation to the Harvard community is, to use a word off his Instagram, “ridiculousness.”
I get a glimpse of Rigo’s social status when he encourages me to rush Kappa Kappa Gamma, because, in his opinion, I would like a pal of his who is a member. (Perhaps he is referring to one of the girls in his current profile picture, captioned “GO Kappa!!”). And he tells me how much fun he had when a student invited him to be her date at a Spee event (A picture from this “epic” night can also be found on Rigo’s instagram.)
But it’s more than just the night life that keeps Rigo tied to Havard students. “I love the people here,” he says. “And I have so many friends.”

UPDATED: February 13, 2016, at 3:50 p.m.
Fiery A. Cushman ’03 is having a bit of trouble with the milk today. His one-year-old daughter, Nell, wriggles and stretches in her high chair, intrigued by the customers at the next table. She finally deems her father, a rising star in Harvard’s Psychology department, worthy of her attention. Holding a napkin under her chin, Cushman gently and steadily tilts the glass toward her mouth.
“They usually give us the milk in a little espresso cup,” he explains. “She’s still learning non-sippy-cup ways of drinking things.” 
The scene is familiar to Cushman. Breakfast at Simon’s is a near-daily ritual for him and Nell before they begin their days—at day care for her, at the Moral Psychology Research Lab for him. Today’s breakfast is a bowl of oatmeal with cranberries and walnuts, which he and his daughter share. He orders a latte and insists that I do the same. Cushman points to a five-year-old girl at the next table, waving to her and her mother. The girl was Nell’s age when Cushman and his wife, Julie E. Kobick ’05, first came to this coffee shop.
The glass is still proving to be a challenge—Nell seems more interested in blowing bubbles than drinking milk. Cushman wipes her mouth again, then puts on her jacket and hat. When it’s time for us to leave Simon’s, he has barely touched his coffee.
The passenger seat of Cushman’s white Honda Civic is occupied by a small suitcase and a monogrammed briefcase—he leaves for San Diego this afternoon. Cushman and his colleagues are going to a convention of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, where Cushman will present on moral learning.
I load the bags into the trunk. Cushion places Nell’s car seat snugly in the backseat. Before bringingNell to daycare, he drives me back to the Yard, where I will meet him later. It’s shopping week, and lecture starts at 1 o’clock.
"I am Fiery," Cushman begins his first lecture of the semester. "Fiery is pronounced like the adjective. It is actually my real name, and it’s my preference that you use it."
Perhaps Cushman developed his preference for first names at Georgetown Day School, where students address teachers informally. When Cushman arrived at Harvard as an undergraduate in 1999, he had to get accustomed to using more formal titles.
“When I came here, I sort of intellectually knew that I was supposed to call Cornel ‘Professor West,’” he recalls. “But it just intuitively felt wrong.”
Cushman is a new associate professor in Harvard’s Psychology department, and the course head for Psychology 15: “Social Psychology.” He taught a similar course at Brown after studying at Harvard for 10 years. When he isn’t taking care of Nell or teaching, he is working in the Moral Psychology Research Lab, investigating age-old questions of morality and human behavior, from a cognitive standpoint rather than a philosophical one.
Before coming to Harvard as an undergraduate, Cushman lived in Bethesda, Maryland. His father was a Washington correspondent for The New YorkTimes, and his mother taught psychology at American University. Cushman and his two younger siblings are evenly spaced in age, seven years apart.
Cushman’s first encountered psychology in middle school, when he read his mother’s developmental psychology textbooks in the basement. It was a “self-taught [lesson] in adolescence,” he jokes.
“My brother is a goof, as we all are,” Cushman’s sister Holloway says of her family. Now a junior at Kenyon College, she is the youngest of the Cushman siblings. “We’re thinking about the human condition all the time,” she says. The middle Cushman sibling, O’Neill, studied philosophy. Although the Cushmans joke that psychology is the family profession, Holloway recalls that it was a surprise when her brother decided to pursue the discipline at Harvard.
Although he was a precocious student in high school, Cushman had a free-spirited, rebellious side, which manifested itself in his hairstyle—a “fro-ponytail,” as Holloway describes it. 
“None of my friends were anything approaching cool at our school,” Cushman says. “But just amongst the six of us, I was the least cool of the uncool.”
Richard Avidon, a faculty member at Georgetown Day School, recounts that Cushman was known for his remarkably analytical and creative mind. Avidon first taught Cushman in a sophomore year government class. One of his memorable assignments was a profile of current presidential candidate John Kasich, then a Representative for the state of Ohio.
The profile was one that could have been found in a newspaper, Avidon recalls. Apparently 16-year-old Cushman was as prophetic as he was eloquent—he ended the article with the question, “Will this man run for president someday?”
Avidon also recalls Cushman’s love of a good joke. During Cushman’s senior spring, Avidon, a self-described “tough teacher,” handed out one of the regular pop quizzes for his constitutional law class.
“You have 15 minutes. Good luck,” Avidon said. When the 15 minutes were up, Avidon was surprised to see that Cushman and a friend had opted out of taking the quiz. With forks, knives, and a bottle of hot sauce, they instead ate it.
“I can’t say I was happy when it happened,” Avidon says. (One of them did hand in the quiz, but it was hard to read because most of it had been chewed up.) “But it forever changed my policy on teaching second semester seniors.”
At 1 p.m., the auditorium is packed. Even before the clock has struck Harvard time, students spill into the aisles, making seats out of the stairs. The air pulses with the usual buzz of shopping week, but the room falls into rapt silence as Cushman begins his lecture. He may eschew the title of “Professor,” but he commands the classroom like the best of them do. 
Cushman begins his lecture with a story of star-crossed lovers. A handsome man and a beautiful woman grow up together and end up working in Hollywood. It seems like they would make a great couple, but alas—an image of Jake and Maggie Gylenhaal pops up on the slide—they’re siblings. Today’s lecture begins with a discussion of the human aversion to incest.
“Every seat was filled, but it was dead quiet when he was talking,” says Curtis M. Hsu ’19, who is now enrolled in the course. “Even though it was a big lecture hall, it felt very personable, the way he talked.”
The feeling of intimacy in the classroom is no accident. Cushman later tells me that he tries to deliver each sentence of the lecture to a particular person in the audience.
“You get 300 people in front of you and there are lights shining in your eyes, and you can just sort of talk out there,” he says. “When you do that, you start using a professor voice, and you start saying sentences that no human being would ever say otherwise.”
It’s no surprise that many students liken Cushman’s lectures to TED talks. (Cushman doesn’t watch TED talks, so he can’t say if this comparison is accurate.)
“Class can be a game of Whack-a-Mole,” he tells me. “When I see someone’s eyelids fluttering, I just start talking to them personally, and I focus on getting them excited. Then by the time that person’s excited, someone else’s eyelids are fluttering. Out of 300 people, someone’s eyelids are always fluttering.”
The lecture skips swiftly and effortlessly across centuries and continents, from Hollywood to the inbred monarchy of 17th-century Britain to the abduction of Appalachian brides.
“During the colonial era, in the area of Appalachia settled by the Scotch-Irish, there were two types of weddings,” Cushman explains. “There were weddings by abduction, and there were weddings by consent, which were generally considered unexciting and needed some kind of enlivening feature." 
The class finishes with a discussion of violence in the modern American South and its relation to other cultures of honor. Cushman investigates this topic, like the previous topic of incest, across the four levels of analysis developed by Dutch scientist Nikolaas Tinbergen: mechanism, ontogeny (development), phylogeny (evolution), and adaptation. He calls Tinbergen an academic ancestor of sorts—the two are connected by a lineage of advisors and advisees.
Cushman cut his ponytail in 1999, right before he started his freshman year at Harvard College. A resident of Pforzheimer House, he concentrated in Biology, but was not particularly excited by his coursework. Between his concentration, core requirements, and Expository Writing, he was left with only five elective courses for all four of his undergraduate years.
“I took a lot of philosophy courses,” Cushman recalls. “I was reading books about the evolution of cooperation and reciprocal altruism, but I was going to courses where I was learning signal transduction pathways and protein kinase and I wasn’t really passionate about what I was studying there.”
Outside of the classroom, Cushman’s undergraduate career was marked by swordplay with the Harvard-Radcliffe Kendo Society and conferences with Harvard Model Congress. 
His wife, Julia E. Kobick ’05, was also active in HMC. (The two of them were presidents of the club during their respective senior years.) When Kobick was a sophomore and Cushman was a senior, the couple fell in love in Barcelona during an international HMC conference. They got married in 2007.
Though Cushman was busy with coursework and his budding romance, he still made time for his family during his college years. Once, five-year-old Holloway visited her brother, and declared that they would throw an Easter-Egg-decorating tea party. Cushman invited all of his friends to the event in his Pforzheimer suite, and they acted out scenes from Pride and Prejudice at Holloway’s request.
Cushman describes the beginning of his collegiate psychology studies as “totally serendipitous.” In the spring of his junior year, he enrolled in a moral psychology course at the recommendation of a roommate.
Cushman took the course and liked it: “The professor said that I should start working in his lab. I worked there, [and he] said I should be a research assistant, so I did that. One thing led to another and suddenly I didn’t have anything else to do and I ended up being a psychologist.”
After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Biology, Cushman applied to the graduate Psychology program at Harvard.
“I only applied to one graduate school because no one else would accept me,” he says. “I had no credentials,no thesis. I had not only not majored in Psychology, I also hadn’t taken very many psychology classes.”
After graduation, Cushman worked in a primate lab led by Marc D. Hauser, who taught the moral psychology class he took during junior year. In a 2006 issue of Fifteen Minutes, Cushman shared insights from the lab, where monkeys were named after famous psychologists:
“Without thinking, you’ll say, ‘Steven Pinker… eats shit all day.’”
After a year in the lab, Cushman was accepted to Harvard. During graduate school, Cushman lived in Cabot House with his wife. The couple made an effort to get to know students by approaching them in the dining hall.
“We used to scare the bajeezus out of sophomores,” he recounts. He and his wife would tell sophomore students that they began dating at that age and subsequently got married. “You’d just see this look of horror— anyone who was dating someone in their sophomore year would get this pale look.”
He stayed in Cambridge for all four years of graduate school and for his two-year postdoctorate, which he completed under Psychology professor Joshua D. Greene’s advisory before a teaching stint at Brown.
Greene is well known for studying the cognitive science and moral psychology of the now-famous trolley problem, an ethical exercise that was generally constrained to philosophy classrooms before his career.
The trolley problem always begins with a runaway trolley about to kill five people. You have the choice of pushing someone in front of the train in order to slow it down and save the passengers, or redirecting the trolley, killing one person. Greene sought to understand why most people would not push a person in front of the trolley, but would flip a switch to redirect it.
“We evolved in an environment where if you wanted to hurt somebody, you had to punch ‘em,” Cushman explains. “Josh’s idea was that evolution designed us to really be averse to punching, kicking, and biting, except in extraordinary circumstances, but evolution never safeguarded us against the more distant and abstract forms of harm because they weren’t relevant.”
Cushman first heard his adviser speak about the trolley problem during graduate school, in William James Hall, the same building where he and Greene now have neighboring offices.
In one experiment, Cushman gave participants a disabled handgun and told them to shoot at his head. Even though he had shown the participants that the gun was disabled and could in no way harm anyone, most showed deep discomfort with the action they were performing and experienced a spike in blood pressure.
In this experiment, Cushman and his colleagues were studying how learning processes affect moral and social behavior. Cushman has built on Greene’s research, and expanded it by employing concepts from computer science and algorithms. 
When Cushman began studying psychology, he thought that, like Greene, he would focus on the evolution of moral behaviors. After reading a textbook written by computer scientists, his interests shifted.
“Suddenly, it became clear that these theories of [machine] learning could also explain the difference between pushing a person and flipping a switch,” he says.
Cushman’s research builds upon Greene’s dual process theory. According to that theory, humans have two competing ways of making moral decisions: emotional gut reactions and deliberative, rational ones. The thought of pushing one person in front of a trolley to save its five passengers triggers a strong emotional response, one which overrides the rational conclusion that five lives saved is better than one.
Cushman analyzes the two competing mechanisms in terms of learning algorithms. Computer scientists have made the distinction between model-free learning and model-based learning for machines. Through model-free assessment, computers learn by habit, by assigning positive or negative value to past actions without fully considering consequences. 
Greene says this could be likened to a rat who learns his way through a maze by memorizing a series of commands, “left right left right,” and finds the cheese through these habitual responses. Model-based learning could be represented by a rat who learns the maze by exploring it and understanding its whole layout, so that it could still find the cheese if one door in the maze were to close.
The handgun experiment found that model-free moral assessment—the emotional aversion to shooting a gun at a person—competes with the rational model-based assessment—that the gun could not hurt the person.
“There’s a habitual value assigned to the gun: It’s usually bad to pull the trigger of a gun that’s pointed at someone’s head,” Cushman says. “We’ve over learned that, even though most of us had never used a gun before.”
Cushman’s research has clear implications for fields other than psychology, such as philosophy and law. Although Cushman is interested in these implications, he understands that what a scientist might discover in a lab does not always manifest outside of it.
Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor and former federal judge, invited Cushman to speak to a class of Law students to discuss psychology as a form of evidence in the courtroom.
“They said, ‘Can you give a coherent theory of the mind and brain? We have about an hour,’” Cushman says. “The answer is no.”
According to Cushman, the issue with bringing brain scans into the courtroom is that neuroscience does not necessarily contribute the evidence that lawyers and judges need. Earlier in his career, Cushman gave a similar lecture to courtroom judges.
“Judges enjoyed the lecture the way they’d enjoy an interesting article in The New Yorker,” he says.
“They would usually say, ‘That was fascinating,' [or], 'I really enjoyed thinking about that. Doesn’t usually have a lot to do with the courtroom.’”
Cushman does, in fact, write articles, if not for The New Yorker, then for Huffington Post Science and New Scientist magazine. The website for Cushman’s lab has a specific section for general audience reading.
Cushman’s dedication to making his work accessible is somewhat surprising, according to Adam M. Morris, a Ph.D. student Cushman first taught as a freshman at Brown.
“If a professor writes a general audience book, it’s looked down on,” Morris says. “It hurts your chances of getting tenure.”
Regardless of tenure-track norms, Cushman remains committed to making his work available to a popular audience as well as his academic mentees.
“The only reason you do this work is because you want to communicate it to other people,” Cushman says.
The Peregrine falcon sits in a wooden frame on a wooden shelf—Cushman took the photo himself, on the rooftop of this very building. Using the tracking band on the bird’s foot, he contacted the man who gave the falcon its tracking number in New Hampshire when it was an infant.
“I sent him some pictures to say, ‘Everything’s all good, he goes to Harvard now,’” Cushman jokes.
Like the students in the Science Center lecture hall, the falcon seems to stay perfectly still, perfectly silent for Cushman. Here perches the world’s fastest animal, captured in an eternal stasis, surrounded by books. 
Some of the books assert themselves so matter-of-factly, with such self-assurance, that their titles beg to be read in curmudgeonly voices. "On War." "On Intelligence." "On Killing." A leather-bound volume bears the same name as this building, William James. A flaming orange paperback asks, "Why Do Men Barbecue?" 
The other contents of the shelves range from the mundane—a restroom sign-out log from an exam—to the whimsical—a hobby horse. Two namesakes sit on the top shelf: a bottle of Grill Mates Fiery 5 Pepper Spice, and a can of Idris Fiery Ginger Beer.
Predictably, there is a shelf filled with books whose titles contain some variation of the phrase “Social Psychology.” 
On this Tuesday afternoon, a roster of postdocs, graduate students, and lab managers cycles through Cushman’s yellow-walled office for individual meetings.
This is a weekly event: As the principal investigator of the Moral Psychology Research Lab, Cushman meets with each member of the lab to discuss new findings or problems from the past week. The white board on the wall fills with overlapping diagrams and half-finished graphs—half-finished because when one person begins drawing something, the other immediately begins to understand.
The first person stops drawing at the epiphanic, “Oh, I see.”
“Finish it this semester,” Cushman tells Morris, his graduate student, about a project he is working on. “There are a lot of things you could give your first-year talk about, and it should be this.”
Morris has worked with Cushman since his sophomore year at Brown, and followed him to Cambridge this year.
“I’ll bring him an idea that I had in a meeting and he’ll always jump a step higher than I thought was possible,” Morris tells me.
“That’s a big part of my role in the lab,” Cushman says. “To keep myself one level of abstraction ahead of the students that I’m mentoring, to pull them to more and more integrative and powerful ideas.”
Just as Greene once inspired Cushman, Cushman now has his own set of mentees eager to build on his work. Cushman’s advisees often praise the same qualities that Cushman ascribes to Greene, such as an ability to communicate effectively in the lecture hall.
“[Cushman] has this knack for coming up with perfect, vivid, concrete examples of things,” Morris says. “You’ll be struggling to explain something to another grad student in these abstract terms and he’ll interject and say ‘Imagine…’ and you’re like, ‘That’s what I meant to say.’”
Sophie W. Smith ’11, one of Cushman’s 15 senior thesis advisees and longtime mentee, says that he taught her “how collaborative and supportive researchers can be.”
“There are these family trees in science, passing on their expertise and knowledge onto the next generation,” Smith says. “I felt very connected to this lineage of researchers who were dedicated to making sure the next generation is equipped to tackle the big questions that remain.”
“Lately, she’s been a little less jolly when I leave her at daycare,” Cushman says while feeding Nell a spoonful of oatmeal. After spending two weeks with her parents during winter break, she is beginning to realize that morning drop-off signifies a seemingly-permanent separation from her Mom and Dad.
Not that Cushman’s psycho-analyzing her. “No one lives like that, like some incompetent Jedi trick,” he says. “You don’t just walk around the world thinking like a psychologist. ”
For now, the advice Cushman has for his youngest mentee is more practical in nature. “You’re not even trying, kid,” Cushman tells his baby daughter as she tries to drink milk from the glass. “You’re just blowing bubbles.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admissions administrators, including Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, have largely supported a recent Graduate School of Education report that calls for widespread change to the college application process.
GSE lecturer Richard Weissbourd was the primary author of the report—titled “Turning the Tide,”—which urges colleges and universities to reduce academic pressure and promote public service among their applicants. More than 80 professors and administrators from colleges and universities across the country endorsed or contributed to the report.
The reception—which Weissbourd said "has been very positive and very encouraging on the whole"—has included feedback from parents, high school guidance counselors, and admissions deans. He added, however, “We have gotten some pushback.”
Weissbourd said he had received particularly strong support for the report’s objectives, namely promoting “ethical engagement to do meaningful community service, reducing excessive achievement pressure and leveling the playing field” for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged students.
“The skepticism is in part whether colleges and high schools can really deliver, whether the rhetoric is going to meet the reality,” he said.
Harvard may alter its process based on the report's suggestions, Fitzsimmons said. 
“Every year we look at our application questions on our own supplement, so we’re looking at the possibility of adding a question that might be relevant to ‘Turning the Tide,’” Fitzsimmons said in an interview Monday.
However, Fitzsimmons, who endorsed the report, emphasized that while his office was “certainly happy to sign on” to it, he added he “wouldn’t necessarily agree precisely with every point in the report.”
Fitzsimmons stressed that his endorsement of “Turning the Tide” did not mean the College is relaxing its expectations for academic rigor. In particular, he pointed to the report’s recommendations that admissions officers reduce pressure on students to take a large number of Advanced Placement courses in high school.
“Academic excellence in all its forms is critically important,” he said. “There are students out there who relish the possibility of taking many AP tests, and it’s one of the things that gets them ready for work in college.”
Similarly, while the report suggests that schools should reevaluate whether the SAT is a predictor of academic success and consider adopting a test-optional admissions policy, Fitzsimmons said Harvard is unlikely to make such a move any time soon.
“We still find that standardized test scores are useful,” Fitzsimmons said. “One of the things that we hope does not get lost in the enthusiasm that people have for the report is academic excellence, measured a whole variety of ways, including by standardized test scores.”
While Harvard is tentatively considering next steps, authors of the report have already begun to see their goals realized at other institutions. Weissbourd said he has received commitments from a number of schools to adapt their admissions processes in line with the report’s recommendations; Yale plans to add essay questions to their applications about “contributing to others.”
Weissbourd said he and his colleagues plan to continue encouraging more institutions to commit to such change. To that end, he said he hoped widely used college applications like the Common Application would also incorporate the report’s suggestions in the future.
While college administrators have largely expressed support for the GSE report, others have been less kind. A recent op-ed by lawyer and author Steve Cohen, published in the New York Times, criticized the report for simply enabling applicants to “game the system” and doing little to genuinely promote equality in education.
Weissbourd responded by saying that colleges should steer students seeking to cheat the process towards morally valuable work, rather than taking no action at all.
“We don’t want you to game things by taking 10 AP courses or starting a new program in Costa Rica,” he said. “We’re looking for intellectual and ethical engagement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge officials have begun the process of forming a sister city relationship with Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, after the passage of a City Council order last month.
“We’re just beginning the process of investigating what might be possible,” said Brian Corr, executive director of the Cambridge Peace Commission, the city organization tasked with creating sister cities.
“The City of Cambridge and the City of Reykjavik would mutually benefit from promoting contact between our governments, nonprofits, businesses and education programs as well as our youth and volunteer programs,” the resolution, which was adopted at the City Council’s January meeting, reads.
The effort was born out of established ties between the two cities according to Corr and Reykjavik’s mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson.
“We can learn a lot from Cambridge,” Eggertsson wrote in an email. “The two cities are roughly about the same size in population and in Reykjavík we have set forward a plan on how to enhance and further the cooperation between the city and the universities.”
He wrote that the two cities are not only connected via daily flights but also through their existing business and educational ties. He visited Cambridge in 2015 and met with representatives from local companies and with Councillor David P. Maher, the town mayor last year.
Cambridge is also home to Robert C. Barber ’72, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to the position in 2013.
The resolution proposed by the Cambridge City Council stated that Barber has advocated for the new relationship in his capacity as a resident of both cities.
Sister cities are official relationships between two municipalities that wish to share aspects of their culture, according to Corr. They are usually built around common interests such as business and research, and help diasporic ethnic groups stay connected to their country of origin.
Cambridge has a long history of global sister city ties, including six active relationships with municipalities including San José Las Flores, El Salvador; Tsukaba, Japan; and Yerevan, Armenia. Former sister cities have included Dublin and Florence. Cambridge is also currently in the process of forming a relationship with Les Cayes, Haiti.
“Cambridge is well known, well connected internationally, obviously through institutions like Harvard and MIT, but just the city in general is very connected internationally,” Corr said.
Corr said he expects the process to take a few months to ensure that the relationship is beneficial to both sides.
“It’s still too early,” Corr said. “For these processes to be sustainable, it usually takes a while.”
Despite the lengthy timeline, Eggertsson said he was optimistic that the sister city partnership would be strong, if implemented.
“Reykjavik prides itself with culture, green energy and environmental issues, as well as gender issues and a developed and modern welfare service,” Eggertsson wrote. “I think both cities have a lot to share.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 11, 2016, at 11:15 a.m.
On the heels of a semester filled with rigorous debate over divisive campus issues,  two undergraduates recently released an app with the goal of creating a virtual and open space for discussion.
The app, called Campfire, is intended to create an open environment for conversation on Harvard’s campus. Jeffrey Zhao ’16, one of two co-creators of the app, said that they gave the app its name because campfires are “a sort of meeting point, a great social point for the community.”
Karine Hsu ’16, the other co-creator, said she believed the online forum would increase student participation in campus-wide discussions, from conversations about courses, to the recently released sexual assault report and the black lives matter protests.
“There were a lot of disparate places that people were talking about things,” Hsu said. “A lot of Facebook statuses, a lot of Crimson op-eds that people were writing, but no one was really responding to them. People were kind of just re-posting them and that was the end of the discussion.”
Though chiefly an anonymous app, Campfire does allow its users to create usernames that can contain their actual names. Aashay A. Sanghvi ’19, a frequent user of  the app, said that this feature is especially useful for users who might want to engage in a conversation on a sensitive topic without having their comments attributed to them.
“With Yik Yak, it’s just a post that’s sort of free and out there, there’s no sense of accountability,” Sanghvi said, referencing an app prominent on college campuses that allows users to anonymously publish short and oftentimes irreverent posts.
Joe W. Kahn  ’18, another Campfire user, said he believes the anonymity feature has so far been successful.
“Forums struggle with anonymity, and that allows people to really act out. It’s the basis of trolling culture, which hasn’t manifested itself yet in Campfire,” he said.
In addition to allowing open discussion on campus topics, the site also hosts a series of “Ask Me Anything” sessions when users can submit questions for guest panelists from industries like finance and consulting.
“We have a few recent grads that work at Facebook and Dropbox that will just answer questions that people have,” Hsu said, referencing tomorrow's discussion.
Since its launch at the start of the spring semester as a part of a Harvard i-Lab event, the site has garnered over 800 users—all Harvard undergraduates, Hsu said.  Zhao and Hsu said they intend to expand the app to MIT within the coming months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Ron K. Unz ’83 flew cross country to turn in almost 300 signatures to Harvard’s doorstep, he and four other alumni—including five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader—can now call themselves candidates for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body.
The unorthodox group launched a bid for the Overseers in January on a two-pronged platform: eliminate tuition and reconsider admissions practices at Harvard College, two proposals that University President Drew G. Faust has staunchly opposed. But before they could qualify as candidates and officially attempt to join the ranks of some of Harvard’s most esteemed supporters, the group needed 201 signatures from Harvard degree-holders.
On Wednesday, the quixotic quintet received confirmation that their petition effort was successful. In an email to Unz, Jeff Caldwell, the director of administration and senior associate secretary at the Office of Governing Boards, wrote that Unz had made the ballot. The four other members of the ballot had received similar notifications, according to Unz.
“I’m relieved,” said Unz. “We gathered all the signatures in basically a couple of weeks despite that huge storm that slowed things down so enormously. There were times during the period of signature gathering when I was very nervous whether we’d make it.”
Along with Unz and Nader, physicist Stephen D. Hsu, conservative writer Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., and attorney Lee C. Cheng ’93 will appear on the ballot distributed to alumni in advance of the May election. While most Overseer candidates are nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association—it nominated eight this year—anyone with a Harvard degree can run for the Overseers.
Patrick S. McKiernan, a spokesperson for Harvard’s office of Alumni Affairs and Development, wrote in an email that the official Overseers ballot would be released “on or after February 15.”
Unz and his colleagues argue that the enormous size of Harvard’s endowment, which reached $37.6 billion last fiscal year, would provide more than enough money to cover the cost of tuition for every undergraduate student. They also suspect that the College’s admissions practices could be discriminatory against Asian American applicants, and they are calling for more detailed public data about Harvard’s admissions practices.
“This is for Harvard’s own good as an institution, and that’s what we’re driving for,”Cheng said. “The decisions shouldn’t be made by a handful of bureaucrats and educrats who are divorced from the real world.”
Harvard officials have rebuked both tenets of the campaign’s platform. In an interview earlier this month, Faust contended that making tuition free would unnecessarily bankroll the cost for wealthy families and defended the College’s consideration of race as a factor in its undergraduate admissions processes.
While Unz said that he would be taking some time to relax after weeks of hectic signature-gathering, he launched a campaign website Wednesday and said he hopes to participate in debates and forums across the country before the election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last two weeks, the Boston Redevelopment Authority has published two online amendments to Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan, the University’s blueprint for its Allston developments.
The first amendment clarifies Harvard’s planning process, proposes bike infrastructure in Allston, updates the status of the proposed $1 billion science and engineering complex, and addresses concerns locals raised in a public comment period that ended in December 2015.
Harvard will take a three-pronged approach to the construction of the new SEAS complex, where roughly two-thirds of the SEAS faculty are slated to move in the fall of 2020. Over the next few years, Harvard will construct the new complex on Western Ave., renovate an existing office building next door for use by SEAS, and erect a district energy facility slated to supply electricity and hot and cold water to the complex.
The energy facility will be located on a Harvard-owned land parcel formerly home to CSX Transportation’s railyard operations. CSX, a railroad company, ceded full development rights for the site to Harvard in December.
The second amendment gives new details on Harvard’s Life Lab, a biotechnology research and entrepreneurial facility scheduled to open in the fall of 2016. The report estimates construction costs at $17 million and designates the Life Lab, along with the adjacent Harvard Innovation Lab, as the future site of an annual Allston-Brighton ice cream social.
“The science and engineering complex and HBS’ life lab… have greatly benefitted from feedback from the community thus far and we appreciate the opportunity to share updates and responses,” Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement.
The updated plans include three new streets, a series of connected parks termed a “Greenway,” and improved bike infrastructure. Harvard gave no specific timeline for construction of the Greenway—planned to connect various Allston parks and provide walking access to the Charles River—but instead discussed future planning concerns and “design issues” for the pathway.
A group of Allstonians has recently advocated for a recreational path for bikers and walkers connecting their neighborhood with Harvard and the Charles River, particularly in the wake of the Turnpike realignment project slated to begin in 2017.
Allston resident Galen M. Mook expressed frustration with what he termed the University’s “piecemeal” approach to the Greenway.
“I believe both the neighborhood and the university would be better served if the pathways were made a priority and fully planned and built at the onset of the construction,” Mook wrote in an email.
Mook, along with fellow Allstonian John Eskew, also voiced concern over the University’s proposed bike infrastructure, emphasizing issues of biker safety and the need for a bike path connecting Harvard’s campus to the Allston neighborhood.
“I'd like to see Harvard take a hard look at North Harvard Street and implement physically separated bike lanes where possible, to connect Barry's Corner up to Harvard Square,” Mook wrote.
Eskew said that Harvard should be especially desirous of constructing a bike lane on North Harvard St. as a more direct connection between Harvard Square and the SEAS complex.
“Harvard students themselves are going to need to transport themselves from main campus over to that building in Allston,” Eskew said. “I would think that Harvard would… want to include some kind of physical barrier protecting bikes from the car traffic on those roads, just because of students’ safety.”

A fundraising challenge established by prominent Harvard donor Glenn H. Hutchins ’77 has earned more than $50 million for House renewal at the College, according to a press release.
The challenge was established in 2012 after the Hutchins family donated $30 million for House renewal and was intended to encourage alumni and Harvard affiliates to donate to House renovation efforts. Hutchins’ foundation matched funds from donors who pledge their support, and with the recent announcement the challenge is now complete.
The gifts are part of Harvard’s ongoing $6.5 billion capital campaign—a University-wide fundraising effort now more than two years into its public stage. $400 million of that total is dedicated to House renewal.
Harvard’s campaign passed the $6 billion mark last semester, with the House renewal priority earning $179 million as of August—fundraising that has been relatively slow compared to other areas. While Harvard has gained momentum after record-breaking gifts, including a donation that renamed the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University President Drew G. Faust said in September she has no plans to raise the campaign’s target.
The donated funds will be used over the coming years to help modernize some of the undergraduate Houses’ rooms, common spaces, and dining spaces.
In 2013 Quincy House opened its doors to residents of the House after 15 months of construction to Stone Hall, and a year later, renovations were completed in Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall. Dunster House recently underwent full renovation and opened last fall. Winthrop and Lowell House are slated to undergo similar renovations over the next few years.

UPDATED: February 15, 2016, at 9:20 a.m.
A Harvard Dental School instructor has been accused of fleeing scholarship loan debts in Thailand, prompting massive outrage in the country among its citizens.
In 1993, Dolrudee Jumlongras allegedly agreed to a scholarship loan of Thai Baht 8 million—which under current exchange rates amounts to roughly $220,000—whereby Thailand’s Mahidol University would sponsor her to study dentistry at Harvard and she would repay the loan upon returning from her studies by working at Mahidol, according to English-language news outlet the Bangkok Post.
However, she is now being accused of violating her agreement by remaining at Harvard as an instructor and not paying back the loan in full.
In an email to The Crimson, Jumlongras wrote, “The most important issue that I would like to address first in this statement is that it has always been my intention to repay the scholarship that I obtained from Mahidol University—be it in the form of serving the university or in monetary terms.”
Jumlongras also wrote that her requests for the payment plan to be extended over a longer time frame were rejected. She added, “Due to severe financial and personal hardships related to visa status and the denial of passport renewal by Mahidol University, I was unable to work for a number of years.”
The Thai university claims that, per the original agreement, she would repay the loaned money by teaching at Mahidol University once she completed her Ph.D. program at Harvard. As part of her scholarship loan agreement from 1993, Jumlongras had four co-signers, or guarantors, that would be forced to repay the loan in the event that Jumlongras failed to repay her debts.
Officials at the university could not be reached for comment.
The nationwide firestorm erupted in part after the publishing of a Facebook post from Padej Poonwithayakij, a Thai dentist who said he was one of the four co-signers of her loan-based scholarship from Mahidol University. In the post, he alleges that Jumlongras is currently not abiding by the loan agreement, and as a result each of the four co-signers have been required to pay back one-quarter of the actual cost of the loan, according to an article in Coconuts Bangkok, an English-language outlet.
In his post, Poonwithayakij included a photo of a check that he said showed he was paying 2.2 million Baht to Mahidol to cover his share. He also added that Jumlongras had only contributed some money toward repaying the loan, leaving the rest of the bill to her co-signers.
A lawyer for the co-signers of Jumlongras’s loan sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust, according to Poonwithayakij’s Facebook post.
According to the Bangkok Post, additional letters from Poonwithayakij have been sent to Harvard Medical School and Dental School ombudsman Melissa Brodrick. While the Bangkok post claimed Brodrick said she was investigating the matter, Brodrick denied the claim in an interview, saying her office has no involvement in investigating the matter.
In recent days, there has been widespread speculation that the Harvard University Facebook page has been blocked in Thailand, as thousands of Facebook users in Thailand have repeatedly given Harvard one-star ratings and authored scathing criticisms of the University’s administration for allowing Jumlongras to remain at Harvard. Since Poonwithayakij’s Facebook post, Harvard’s Facebook rating has dropped to 2.3 stars. Several months ago, it was more  than 4 stars, according to retrieved screenshots of the page.
Jumlongras received her Ph.D. from the Dental School in 2003 and works at Harvard as an instructor at the Dental School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after its creation, the Harvard Business School’s Gender Initiative—which aims to promote the advancement of women in business—has helped raise awareness of concerns about gender imbalance at the school, faculty members and students say.
The initiative, spearheaded by professor Robin J. Ely, is a research-based effort launched last spring that provides empirical data to companies and the school itself. It is part of the Business School’s larger effort to grapple with concerns of gender imbalances among its faculty and students over the past years.
Ely, who also serves as the faculty liaison to the Women’s Student Association, said that members of the initiative regularly shares their findings with the student group. The association is the largest club on campus, according to its president, Angela C. Winkle.
Winkle said that the initiative has helped raise the awareness within the school of gender imbalance in the business world. Now, gender is “very much in the consciousness” of students and professors alike, she said.
While the initiative is primarily focused on academic research, it has influenced course development at the school as well.
For example, some professors have increased the representation of female protagonists in the cases they use for class and use this to market the course to students, Winkle said.
Frances X. Frei, the school’s senior associate dean for faculty and recruiting, said that there is no significant gap in academic achievement or overall satisfaction between male and female students at the Business School.
While the progress among the students has been “amazing,” she said, they are only at the Business School for two years. The professors, on the other hand, are at the school for considerably longer.
Because of this reality, Frei said she is committed to addressing gender imbalance concerns  in the faculty through a more balanced hiring process.
Frei said in the past three years, her group has recruited an equal number of male and female junior faculty members, which is the first time in the history of the school that this has happened.
“Three years of this hiring very quickly starts to change the complexion of the school,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With last school year’s increase of $30,000 in funding for domestic student group travel, some club leaders say that travel grant funding levels are still insufficient, while others praise the increased focus on safety.
In the spring of 2014, the College convened an Office of Student Life working group to discuss student group transportation safety following the death of Angela R. Mathew ’15 in a car accident while returning to campus from a mock trial competition. On the recommendations of the working group, the College decided to increase its student group travel grant budget from $20,000 to $50,000 starting in the 2014-2015 academic year.
Rather than increase the frequency of travel for student groups, the OSL is focusing the increased budget on helping student organizations make safer, more responsible travel plans, according to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, who was part of the original working group.
“This money is meant to incentivize making those responsible choices,” Friedrich said.

Some clubs said they are benefiting from the increased budget.
“We applied for and got money from that grant this year, and it was definitely helpful for us,” said Emily R. Zoffer ’17, the business manager of the Radcliffe Pitches. “We had a tour in Chapel Hill, North Carolina this J-term, and the travel grant helped all of our members get there safely.”
Students also praised the application’s increased emphasis on safety, which rewards applicants who demonstrate an understanding of how best to travel in a safe fashion, according to Friedrich.
“Because in the application they say to emphasize safety,  it forced me while we were still in the planning process for the trip [to] actually think about how we were going to keep the trip safe,” Zoffer said.
Despite such praise, however, not all student groups are completely satisfied with the current level of funding.
“We certainly are very appreciative of any and all money that we get, but the money that we do get [from the Office of Student Life] funds a very, very small fraction of our costs,” said Jordan A. Alston-Harmon ’17, president of the Harvard Mock Trial Association. “Although we get the travel grants each semester, that can maybe cover one tournament weekend, maybe for one team.”
Not all clubs have been able to reap the benefits of increased funding, prompting dissatisfaction from some club leaders. According to Friedrich, 38 out of 53 travel grant applications were approved this most recent semester.
“I think that there’s been a lot of great steps in the right direction. But more funding is always a better idea,” said Alston-Harmon. “A fundamental part of being in college is these extracurricular groups, and I think some of the most rewarding experiences are ones in which you get to travel across the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 11, 2016, at 12:11 p.m.
Lowell House renovations will last two years as the "largest and most complex renewal project thus far," requiring residents to live in swing housing for the entirety of construction, according to Lowell House masters.
In an emailed statement signed by co-House masters Diana L. Eck and  Dorothy A. Austin sent to Lowell residents late Wednesday night, the House masters indicated that renovations would begin in June 2017 and last one year longer than previously anticipated.
“This will surely come as a shock to some of you, as it did to us at first,” the statement reads. “But this is the best and most realistic timeline for a house as large and magnificent as Lowell.”
During the two-year long construction, the Harvard Inn and a number of University-owned apartment buildings near Harvard Yard will serve as swing housing for Lowell residents displaced by the construction.
According to Eck, one of the main challenges Lowell will face going forward will be to maintain the spirit and sense of community of the House during the two years of swing housing, a period she described in an interview as a “diaspora.”
With the renovations of Quincy House’s Stone Hall, Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, and most recently, Dunster House, and the upcoming construction of Winthrop House slated to begin later this year, Lowell will be the fifth house to receive an architectural redesign as part of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project.
According to Eck, the renewal will focus on maintaining Lowell House’s traditional aesthetic and artistic character, while updating common spaces, creating more in-suite common rooms, replacing many in-suite bathrooms with hallway bathrooms, and making the entire house accessible.
Over the past several months, Lowell House staff have met repeatedly with the architectural firm KieranTimberlake, the same architects used for the Dunster House renovation, according to Eck.  However, she emphasized that Lowell’s renovations will look and feel different from Dunster’s.
“Lowell House is not Dunster House and the style of the House is different,” said Eck. “Certainly the common spaces will be much more traditional, like the ones we have now.”
Lowell House residents were simultaneously excited and hesitant about the renewals.
“My only thought is that I don’t want hallway bathrooms,” said Emma I. Weil ’18. “I just really don’t want hallway bathrooms.”
According to Eck, there will be some in-suite bathrooms, but “on the whole” there will be hallway bathrooms. This change will result in more common rooms available for student use. The move to hallways bathrooms will be the norm with renovations at other Harvard Houses.
Other students had similar trepidations.
“I really want in-suite common rooms and in-suite bathrooms, better insulation, and fewer mice,” said Philipp K. Nowak ’18.
Eck said that the House master's residence, the dining hall, the junior common room, the small dining hall, the library will also undergo renovation, although the plans will seek to preserve those rooms’ “historic qualities.”
“This is an ongoing process to figure out things and we’re mostly in the initial stages but there’s a lot more to happen” said Eck. “It will be different, but it will be better.”
In the coming weeks Lowell will host a series of feedback sessions for students to voice their opinions about the renovations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hosting the Beanpot for the second time in the event’s history, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams emerged victorious at the ninth annual rendition of the Boston-based tournament against Brandeis, MIT, and Boston College.
The men’s team displayed a strong all-around showing in the épée, foil, and saber events, besting its opponents and emerging with a 3-0 overall victory. Similarly, the women’s team swept the three rival schools, with the most decisive victory coming in the saber division.
The Beanpot came merely three days after the Crimson competed in the Ivy League Championships in Ithaca, N.Y., where the women’s team tied for first, alongside Columbia and Princeton, and the men’s team earned a fourth place finish.
The respite between the Ivy League Championships and the Beanpot was shorter than the typical rest afforded following matches.  However, the men’s and women’s teams managed to regain their vitality and pull off the victory.
“We definitely poured a lot of our physical and mental energy into the Ivy League Championships this past weekend,” said junior co-captain Liana Yamin. “But, we came into tonight with our minds set on replicating the same intensity we brought into the Ivy Champs.”
HARVARD WOMEN’S FENCING
While the women’s team managed to prevail over the other three teams, the bouts were more competitive than Harvard had hoped. While the team came away with three wins, the Crimson still  recognized the need to address potential areas of improvement in future matches.
The women’s foil squad lost its matches against Brandeis with a 4-5 score and Boston College with a 3-6 score.  However, it successfully managed to tally up enough victories to strike down the MIT foil fencers.
“I definitely think we didn’t perform as well as we could have,” sophomore foil fencer Hellary Zhang, an active Crimson editor, said. “I don’t think it’s really indicative of how well we can fence.”
While the women’s team spent the past two days recovering both physically and mentally from the weekend competition, it seemed as if fatigue still played a factor in the team’s overall performance. Many of Harvard’s adversaries, especially Boston College, proved to be fiercer competitors in this year’s Beanpot, leading to results in the foil and épée events that were much closer than last year’s scores.
“We definitely have some tough opponents,” Zhang conceded. “There were some really good fencers at Brandeis, BC, and MIT.”
Despite the shortcomings of these two squads, the women’s saber fencers made up for lost bouts in the other squads.  In this category, the Crimson shut out both Brandeis and MIT.
Against Boston College, the saber squad only lost one bout, tallying a 26-1 overall victory over the three schools. The women’s team has won every single Beanpot in the tournament’s nine-year stint, winning every single game in the tournament’s history.
HARVARD MEN’S FENCING
The men’s fencing team bounced back from a disappointing performance at the Ivy League Championships, beating all three opponents by respectable margins at the Beanpot on Wednesday.
“We didn’t do so hot at Ivy’s,” sophomore saber fencer Eric Zhao said. “It was definitely a tough experience for us, but we came back and generally fenced pretty well here.”
The saber squad, for which Zhao was one of the three competitors representing Harvard, won all of its matches, with a 5-4 victory over MIT, a 7-2 victory over BC, and a 6-3 victory over Brandeis.
“I’m not really disappointed in any way with how we performed as a team,” added Zhao.
The foil squad had the most impressive showing for the men’s team.  The division managed to shut out Boston College and prevailed over MIT and Brandeis, winning eight out of nine bouts in both matches.
The men’s team captured the Beanpot victory last season, beating each opponent by at least ten points.
The Crimson has dominated in the nine years of the Beanpot, not having lost since its inception.

Now that we’re well-adjusted to spring semester—the third Monday has passed, two minor snowstorms have hit, and Beyoncé has just dropped another single sure to distract from any productivity—it’s a perfect moment reflect on the days of yesteryear. Ah, better days… The times when Dean Pfister sent emails on the regular about various fungi, or when the idea of changes to the system of Gen Ed was only a pipe dream. And, of course, the times when we eagerly awaited the next episode of “IVY.”
If you have been too busy actually paying attention in class or are just too young to remember, “IVY” was a look into the lives of five sophomores trying to navigate their lives at Harvard. It was “the first web series fully committed to detailing the intricacies and hilarity of the Ivy League undergraduate experience.”
And it had all one needed. Angst. Some artsy stares. And then more angst. But sadly, the last update of the Flyby acclaimed, short-lived series was its second episode, released December 21, 2014. And we still have questions: Are Harley and that guy still consciously coupling? Did anyone else threw up in the mouth of someone they were making out with? Was  “IVY” ultimately better than “Absent,” which is also absent? Has anyone really gotten their stuff together? #probablynot.
It’s probable that we will never get a new update in the series. But nonetheless, we pray for its return. Having “IVY meant having more things to watch when you have binged everything on Netflix. It meant recognizing someone you met at a party or in section as a scene extra. Above all, it meant acknowledging the wonderful creative talents (and angst) of our Harvard peers.
Goodbye Ivy, we hardly knew thee.

Despite a growing number of new HUDS initiatives directed at offering students healthier and more well-balanced meals, we have been unable to escape the myriad varieties of deep-fried potato. HUDS offers the humble spud in a number of forms to satisfy your need for starch. These executions succeed to varying degrees.
So, if you're perpetually wondering if you should go for the rosemary-roasted potatoes or skip the mash, here is Flyby’s definitive ranking of HUDS potato dishes.
The BestThe Tater Tot: #tbt to your elementary school cafeteria. Plop a few of these onto your plate and pop a few more into your mouth while you’re waiting in line to get real food. With a golden crunchy coating and a soft luscious center, tater tots are consistent and determined to please.
The Middle of the PackThe Curly Fry: One part fry plus one part curl makes a snack that is delicious to eat. Who would've thought that something Arby's and HUDS had in common could taste so good?
The Baked: We're always excited for baked potato day. What better way to pig out than to load all of our favorite toppings into one, starchy vessel? To be honest, though, we wish the baked potatoes weren't awkwardly lukewarm.
The Waffle Fry: They're no Veritaffles, of course, but we do love the crunch, perfectly fried deliciousness of HUDS waffle fries. (Yes, let the record show that we just used the words "perfect" and "HUDS" in the same sentence.) The only reason these babies aren't in the Best category is because we see them so infrequently.
The Roasted: These unassuming, rosemary-covered staples are the definition of innocuous. Sure, we're never thrilled to see them, but we can trust that they'll go fine with out Herb Spiced Chicken or "Catch of the Day."
The Mashed: We always have such high hopes for this comfort food classic. Unfortunately, despite being served from under heat lamps, HUDS mashed potatoes are always just a little bit cold, and always either lumpier or waterier than expected. 
The WorstThe French Fry: the classic wouldn’t itself at the bottom of this list if it weren’t so readily available. HUDS doesn’t need to take up a place on the buffet counter with an item that is already available during every meal from the grille. The HUDS French fry has given a bad name to French fries everywhere, and deserves its place as the worst HUDS potato dish.
