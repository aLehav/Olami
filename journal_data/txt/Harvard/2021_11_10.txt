After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s new Science and Engineering Complex is an expansive, beautifully constructed building. From the useful makerspaces to the new furniture and appliances, the building is a testament to the innovation and ingenuity that engineering can accomplish. Situated in Allston — a Boston neighborhood located a 20 or so minute walk from Harvard’s River Houses — the SEC represents a visual symbol of Harvard’s expansion into Allston, complete with the near-constant commute of Harvard shuttle buses. This project has been decades in the making, and Harvard has had a long, sometimes contentious, history of expanding its presence in Allston.
Originally the home of the Massachusett people, the land that is now Allston was soon colonized and called “Little Cambridge” until 1807, and in 1868, Allston was divided from Brighton and given its current name.
In 1997, it was announced that Harvard University had been quietly acquiring 52.6 acres of land in Allston, and in 2000, the University acquired another 48-acre parcel of land from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. In 2003, Harvard further extended its reach, buying an adjacent land parcel of 91 acres for $75 million, bringing the total area of land the University owned in Allston to 341 acres, significantly more than the 219 acres it owned in Cambridge at the time.
In addition to just acquiring land, Harvard has also acted as a landlord to different businesses and organizations in Allston, with one of the most notable being WGBH, a public radio station in Boston. Though WGBH had a lease until 2044, it opted to move out of Allston as Harvard was eyeing the neighborhood for further expansion in the early 2000s; the area that WGBH previously occupied is now where the SEC’s campus sits.
Many are concerned about the University contributing to gentrification in Allston, worried that Harvard’s expansion into the neighborhood may hurt local residents who now find themselves amidst a busy satellite campus for one of the most prestigious universities in the world. For Meredith Zielonka ’25, Harvard’s expansion into Allston is more personal. “My parents used to work at the old location of WGBH,” Zielonka said in an interview. “I have very specific memories located with that neighborhood, what it used to look like, and now there’s this giant building there.”
Harvard’s expansion into Allston with the SEC represents not only a tug of war between the University and the community it is building into, but also between the historic engineering buildings near Oxford Street and the new SEC. Built in 1901, Pierce Hall is one of the oldest buildings in the historic complex in Cambridge, and it has been a home to many a Nobel Laureate, such as Nicolaas Bloembergen, who won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in laser spectroscopy and nonlinear optics. A University task force announced in June that it planned to vacate Pierce Hall.
Thus, many began to contemplate the contrast between the historic engineering campus in Cambridge and the sparkling SEC in Allston. As Rachel Zhou ’24 put it in an interview, “It’s really strange to see how these buildings have been almost just abandoned, even though they’re still usable.”
Pierce Hall’s buildings are now emptier than usual, but still usable and full of historic charm, which seems at odds with expanding into a neighborhood that the University historically has not been very connected to. This begs the question: Although students and Harvard affiliates are benefitting from the University’s Allston expansion, how can the University work to make sure that Allston’s residents themselves are also seeing benefits? What is the need for such expansion when there are already buildings to be used? If there must be expansion, how can the University be a good steward unto its new communities and ensure the livelihood of those communities’ residents?
Most importantly, whose comfort are we prioritizing? Is our comfort, of having beautiful new spaces, more important than the comfort of Allston’s residents, many of whom may have lived in the neighborhood for generations? In prioritizing one group’s comfort over another, what does that say about us, when we want to break down the stereotype that the University is simply just an ivory tower.
It is hard to reconcile how the University’s developments threaten to gentrify Allston, while historic brick buildings sit empty in Cambridge. In this tug of war, we’re at a standstill, with the new SEC now bustling and the old SEAS complex being slowly emptied. The University must engineer better solutions to amend this paradox and become a more positive influence on the Allston community it has expanded into.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The voting period for the Undergraduate Council presidential and vice presidential elections opens this Thursday at noon. We’re running for UC President and Vice President to bring direct democracy to the College through civic tech.
Direct democracy is neither new nor extinct. Swiss cantons, or districts, incorporate many aspects of direct democracy at more local levels, dating to pre-sovereignty political traditions. Ancient Athens was governed by direct democracy for centuries. Citizens of the Crow Tribe regularly vote on binding referendums by majority rule.
All these communities have something in common: a relatively small electorate — just like Harvard. Representative democracy was originally justified on elitist and practical grounds. Its outsize role on the UC leads to ineffectiveness and is not consistent with the College’s core values of inclusion, equity, or fairness.
The ancients believed only certain people were fit to lead — an antiquated idea we vehemently oppose but that incumbents love to flaunt. We believe every student is qualified to serve on the UC or as its president — what qualifications could you possibly need to serve on the UC? But it is true that representatives are needed at a certain point because it’s impractical to bring so many people together to make important decisions.
Technology solves the practicality problem. In 2016, a group of politicians and activists in Taiwan, going by the name “g0v,” were struggling with some of the same problems we’re seeing at the College today. A Guardian article on the subject summarizes their viewpoint well. “As g0v saw it, the problem of politics was essentially one of information. Elections were too infrequent to give lawmakers much of an idea of what the public wanted.” Infrequent UC elections — essentially popularity contests that highly favor incumbents — make it hard for our representatives to know what students want. Similarly, when “Abolish UC” presidential and VP candidates rake in the most first-choice votes, dissatisfaction with UC dysfunction is obvious. But how to fix it?
The gov movement’s solution to its analogous situation was the site Pol.is. Participants log on and “tweet” out comments to summarize their views, or just to make their point heard. Comments then circulate to participants who can swipe to agree or disagree with comments. As the poll continues, broadly held consensus views emerge. Rather than polarizing users, the app brings them together around common interest. When it’s been used in Taiwan, it’s led to decisive government action 80 percent of the time. On campus, a similar site would have other advantages. It is easy to join — you don’t have to download anything, and most people would just scroll and swipe.
We believe the answer to the UC problem is not abolition, but reformation. Pol.is can work at the College in conjunction with our representative system. Someone must be there to do the UC’s core functions. Yes, the grant and funding processes are controversial and opaque. The UC archives have not been updated since summer 2020. But institutions are hard to build, and we are better off transforming what we have.
The threat of “mob rule” in direct democracy exists, but we can mitigate it. If safeguards exist to protect minority rights, the tyranny of the majority that James Madison feared can be avoided.
As it stands, our representative democracy has resulted in tyranny of the minority and flat-out ineffectiveness. For example, 89 percent of Americans support universal background checks for gun buyers, but our system fails to match the public’s desires. In September, 96 percent of students voted in favor of the “save shopping week” referendum. When the administration instituted a spring 2022 Course Preview Period, the UC did little besides, of course, issuing a statement and allocating $3,000 to a new “advocacy” fund (essentially leaving all real action to someone else). As if students could have given the Council a more clear mandate.
Pol.is can function as an organizing tool to power leaderless movements, which could be highly effective on our small campus. Anyone could suggest an idea, people could vote on it, discuss it, suggest modifications, and build momentum on campus around the best plan. For example, we could use Pol.is to coordinate students enrolling in eight classes at the start of the spring semester to sabotage the registrar in protest. Pol.is would facilitate widespread engagement and give weight to ideas and the commitment of classmates. The resulting action would be much more meaningful than the virtue-signaling statements the UC adores.
Tools like Pol.is are changing what’s possible for democracies. We shouldn’t shy away from experiments: It was just 80 years ago that the world boasted fewer than 10 democracies. We are positive that the College is capable of more cooperation and better governance than the dreary state of the UC suggests.
We are running for the Undergraduate Council to bring student voices together to answer important policy questions. We think students have the right to self-determination beyond choosing representatives whose operations are hard to track down. All students should have power, not only those who pretend themselves to be Harvard’s senators or members of Congress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Light is an essential component of many religions. Historically, in Islam, the sun was used to help determine the Qiblah — the direction that points towards the Kaaba in Mecca — where Muslims around the world face during prayer. The Hindu holiday Diwali — a five-day festival that took place earlier this month — celebrates the triumph of light over darkness. The phrase “let there be light” can be found in the very beginning of the Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Torah.
However, at Harvard, only students of certain religious faiths are able to gather in religious spaces that let light in. Harvard students of Muslim and Hindu faiths must practice their religion in the basement of the freshman dormitory Canaday, with no windows, no sunlight, and too little space to pray without waiting in line.
It is extremely saddening that Muslim and Hindu students are relegated to such disrespectfully small and inappropriately gloomy spaces. Prayer spaces are, by virtue, meant to embody the love and care that believers hold for their faiths. Low-ceilinged, dark, isolated rooms in the basement of Canaday personify nothing but neglect. And while it’s easy to point a finger at the University, we must point one inward as well: This, regrettably, is the first time our Editorial Board has opined on the inadequacy of a basement prayer space despite this being a problem for the past 25 years.
The Muslim and Hindu prayer spaces exist in stark contrast to the spaces on campus that Christan and Jewish students enjoy. Christian students may gather in Memorial Church, a beautiful, lofty structure with arched windows and velvet carpet. Jewish students have Rosovsky Hall, a building complete with multiple prayer rooms, a library and lounge, and a full-service dining hall. The building, which houses Harvard Hillel, could only be actualized through high-profile donations. The creation of supportive, student-centered campus spaces, however, should never be contingent upon the generosity of outside donors. This task must be a University priority.
Proper prayer spaces for Muslims and Hindus at Harvard are not frivolous additions to campus — they are essential to nurturing diverse communities such as ours, and sending the message that all faiths are respected and celebrated at Harvard.
Though Harvard has no official religious affiliation today, it is worth mentioning that the University was founded by Puritans whose Christian influences have pervaded Harvard for almost four centuries. Though no longer a theological institution, a brief glance around campus will reveal that many of Harvard’s most beautiful and famous buildings — freshman dine under stained glass that evokes scripture and depicts ministers mid-sermon in Annenberg — contain echos of our Christian origins, even if their modern functions are now secular.
Unfortunately, dilapidated prayer spaces are not the only way Harvard fails to meet the basic needs of Muslim and Hindu students. For Muslim students in particular, it is difficult to grab a Halal-friendly meal from the dining halls. Unlike the offerings for Jewish students at Hillel, Harvard has no Halal-specific dining hall, only designated areas across the Houses: one in Annenberg, one in Cabot, and one in Adams. However, since the recent fruit-fly infestation temporarily closed Adams’s dining hall, upperclassmen living in the River houses who keep Halal now have even fewer options. They can request a Halal entree from the other dining halls, but the meal takes at least ten minutes to prepare, and stretches longer when dining halls are overcrowded.
This dining ordeal is inconvenient for both the Harvard University Dining Services employee and student, who must both go out of their way to feed and be fed. Although Harvard sends out dietary restriction surveys to students each year, when Muslim students arrive on campus and attempt to eat at the dining halls, Harvard behaves as though their requests were unexpected; as a consequence, Muslim students are put in the awkward position of having to ask for daily accommodation.
Eating is not an inconvenience. Harvard must do better in ensuring that Muslim students do not feel like their food preferences are disruptive to the operations of HUDS, and provide ready-made Halal meals at each dining hall.
At the College, Muslim and Hindu students’ prayer is sequestered below ground and their dietary needs are barely met: In some respects, this constitutes bodily hostility. It signals that Harvard was not designed, and has not made plans, with these students in mind. A University spokesperson declined to comment on the recent Crimson article detailing these inequities, which is telling in and of itself.
The University must rectify this blatant disregard of Muslim and Hindu students, and do so quickly. Muslim and Hindu students deserve beautiful, above-ground prayer spaces they can call their own, where sunlight can stream through the windows.
Going forward, Harvard must also be proactive in supporting students practicing their faiths. During Ramadan, for example, ensuring access to hot, Halal food for Muslim students for Suhoor (before sunrise) and Iftar (after sunset) is essential to their well-being. In addition to providing the basic facilities that Christian and Jewish students are offered, informed measures like this would go a long way to making sure that students from other faiths feel recognized by the University, and can navigate life at Harvard with the relative ease enjoyed by their peers.
In the face of neglect from the University, Muslim and Hindu students have nevertheless cultivated vibrant communities in the subterranean spaces they have been given. Harvard must give these religious communities the respect they deserve. This means housing and feeding them properly. It means finally giving their prayer spaces a place in the sun on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 200 demonstrators, including U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), other elected officials, undergraduates, and union supporters, called on Harvard to offer higher wages to its custodial workers and security officers at a rally in Harvard Yard Tuesday afternoon.
The Harvard College Student Labor Action Movement organized the event in conjunction with the Young Democratic Socialists of America in support of Harvard custodial workers and security officers, who are represented by 32BJ Service Employees International Union.
The union began negotiations in October for a new contract with the University; its current one-year contract is set to expire on Nov. 15.
According to SLAM, Harvard offered the union a five-year contract this week that included a 2 percent annual wage increase, which SLAM said fails to match the rate of inflation and does not meet standard living costs.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the rally.
Roxana Rivera, vice president of 32BJ, said at the rally that the 1,000 Harvard workers the union represents “deserve a living wage.”
“We are coming off of a pandemic and we’re still in it — that hasn’t happened for a century,” she said. “Now, what is the richest University in the world going to do to help those families catch up?”
“This needs to be a recovery contract — one that gets people up and forward for the next four years,” Rivera added.
Harvard custodian Itelvina Fernandes told the demonstrators that workers are not asking for more than what they feel they are owed.
“It’s what we believe in and what we deserve,” Fernandes said. “With more than $53 billion dollars and they then come with 2 percent. They think we’re gonna be down, but that just makes us stronger.”
Doris E. Reina-Landaverde, who has also worked as a Harvard custodian for 17 years, said in an interview that she plans to carry out a hunger strike on Monday if Harvard fails to meet 32BJ SEIU’s demands before the contract expires that day.
“Most of us, we are immigrants, and most of us, we work two or three jobs because what we get here in Harvard is just for rent, but we need money for buying food, and this is what we are fighting for,” Reina-Landaverde said. “We want a fair contract, a better wage, because we need to bring the bread on the table for our families.”
Speaking at the rally, Pressley voiced support for 32BJ and its demands.
“Organized power is realized power,” Pressley said. “I think people get it twisted and think that we’re somehow making an appeal for a charity or trying to speak to their benevolence. This isn’t charity, this is reciprocity.”
SLAM organizer Raghav R. Chopra ’24 encouraged undergraduate students to contact University administrators to advocate for fair compensation for custodial workers, proper winter uniforms, and employment protections for workers who report injuries.
“If we show them that we support them — that we’re cognizant of the amount of effort that they put in, and that they deserve to be treated fairly because of the work that they do to help us get a proper education — then that’ll give them the willpower and the courage to get through these negotiations,” Chopra said.
Carter G. Demaray ’25, a rally attendee, said undergraduates would stand behind Harvard staff members.
“There are students here that care,” Demaray said. “There are students here that are willing to stand up and make sure that everyone is getting what they deserve.”
Members of other Harvard unions, including Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers President Brandon J. Mancilla, argued at the rally that Harvard had failed to provide sufficient wage increases to any of its unions in recent negotiations.
“It’s unacceptable to come to the workers that have sustained this campus during quarantine, and in this pandemic have made a pretty easy, seamless transition into an in-person semester again, and telling them ‘Oh, we can’t actually afford to give you what you need to survive in this city’ as the cost of living increases once again,” he said.
State Representative Michael L. Connolly, who represents part of Cambridge, said in an interview following the rally that “custodians do some of the most difficult work anywhere.”
“The notion that after all they did on the frontlines of this pandemic to keep the University open and to keep it running, the fact that the offer of a raise has only been 2 percent, which doesn’t even keep up with inflation, is incomprehensible and outrageous,” Connolly said.
In an interview after the event, Pressley said she hopes Harvard’s administration will meet the union’s demands.
“This is an august institution which develops world leaders,” Pressley said. “I think leadership is about empathy and compassion. And so it isn’t enough to produce leaders in the world who you’re asking to practice that, if the very institution itself is not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To redress a “marked dearth” of conservative and political thought on campus, earlier this month undergraduates revived The Salient, a publication originally founded at Harvard in 1981 that aims to elevate contrarian viewpoints and promote open debate.
College students found copies of the first iteration of the revived The Salient outside their dorm rooms last week. The November edition — entitled “Revising America: The Deconstruction of the American Commonwealth and the Patriot’s Reply” — contains eight essays published under pseudonyms like “Publius” and “Marcus Porcius Cato.”
Jacob A. Cremers ’23-’24, the spokesperson for The Salient, wrote in an emailed statement that the organization’s editors decided to revive the publication to promote diversity of thought on campus.
“The Salient has traditionally served as a source and platform of independent and contrarian thought at Harvard; it seemed to us a shame that it had vanished without leaving another newspaper to take its place,” he wrote. “Its revival, then, is intended to fill the vacuum and to encourage diversity of opinion on Harvard’s campus.”
Members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Conservative Club founded the original Salient in 1981. At the time, editors described the publication as “moderate to conservative,” but said they solicited diverse political opinions in their pages.
Today’s editors of The Salient espouse a similar philosophy.
“No opinion is barred from The Salient, so long as it is well argued and rationally defended. We do not expect agreement. We expect controversy,” the paper’s introduction reads.
The original Salient provoked its fair share of controversy.
In 2006, The Salient republished four Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, a decision which drew criticism from student groups including the Harvard Islamic Society and the Society of Arab Students.
And in 2002, the editor of The Salient wrote a homophobic letter to the editor published in The Crimson, which sparked outrage and led two of The Salient’s editors to resign.
The revived Salient’s November edition includes essays like “Utah: A Model for America,” which argues that Utah has the lowest economic inequality in the country thanks to the state’s commitment to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and “The Liberal Tyrant,” which contends that the United States undermines stability and respect for customs in its pursuit of liberal change throughout the world.
The organization grants writers anonymity to promote the free exchange of ideas and prevent “ad hominem attack,” Cremers wrote.
“Pseudonyms are used in order to encourage freedom of expression and attract contributors who would otherwise be too shy of public exposure,” he wrote. “The pseudonyms also allow readers to focus on the ideas communicated, rather than the writer behind them.”
Cremers added that The Salient plans to publish two to three times per semester and will commentate on topics such as current events, Harvard issues, philosophy, and political theory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student advocates at the Harvard Kennedy School reacted with disappointment to demographic numbers released in the school’s annual diversity report, which revealed that the HKS student body and faculty remain mostly white.
The report, released last month, showed only minor changes in the makeup of the HKS student body and faculty in the last year. The faculty remains overwhelmingly white and male, with 77 percent of tenured faculty identifying as white and 74 percent identifying as male.
Gilbert Placeres — who serves on the coordinating team of the HKS Equity Coalition, a student group advocating for improved anti-racism efforts at the school — said he was “not surprised” by the report, but voiced “continued disappointment in the lack of representation” at the school.
Placeres said it is “really clear” that students at the school disproportionately come from privileged backgrounds, which he said negatively impacts classroom experiences.
“You’re talking about policy and talking about solutions, but you don't have enough people in the room who have actually been impacted by these issues — who actually live them every day,” Placeres said.
Morgan K. Benson, another member of the Equity Coalition’s coordinating team, said he hopes to see the school release more data about international students and BGLTQ and non-binary students.
The diversity report did not include any data about the racial breakdown of international students, meaning that statistics about the racial makeup of the school are based only on domestic students. The report said the school does not report the racial breakdown of international students “because race and ethnicity are interpreted differently in different settings around the world.”
The diversity report did not include any data about BGLTQ or non-binary students.
In a statement, HKS spokesperson Sofiya C. Cabalquinto wrote that the school has “seen an increase across the past four years in the percentage of U.S. students who are Black/African American or Hispanic/Latinx from 15 percent to 24 percent.”
Ratna Gill ’16, another member of the Equity Coalition, said there is an “unacceptable” lack of Black professors at HKS. The Kennedy School currently has two tenured Black professors and two Black professors of practice.
Gill said the lack of faculty diversity puts “pressure” on students from underrepresented groups to speak up against “microaggressions” and a “lack of understanding around structural inequities.”
“I think faculty of color and faculty who do study the intersection of race, gender, and class are really important to be able to handle those things when they happen in class, and to be able to address them in a way that makes students feel safe and heard,” Gill said.
A survey conducted by the Kennedy School Student Government and Equity Coalition in May found that 82 percent of Black students do not believe that “faculty are equipped to facilitate class discussion around racial equity.”
Deepanshu Aggarwal, an international student at HKS, said he would like to see a heavier emphasis on studying developing countries in the school’s curriculum. Aggarwal said case studies in negotiations classes focus largely on U.S. examples.
The Kennedy School has long faced calls to improve diversity. This summer, the school released a diversity and anti-racism action plan detailing its efforts to improve racial equity, including the creation of an Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging.
Didier P. Dumerjean, the vice president of diversity, equity, and anti-racism on the HKS Student Government, said the school’s administration has not been proactive in addressing diversity and anti-racism issues.
“A lot of what seems to be progress that has been made within the institution has mostly been concessions that the organization or administration has made to students,” Dumerjean said. “It’s not lost on me that a lot of what has changed has mostly been because of student advocacy, and without it, the institution would not have done any of it.”
“Even then, it really is with clenched teeth that they are implementing some of these things,” Dumerjean added.
Benson, of the HKS Equity Coalition, said the school is often in a “defensive mode” when students suggest areas for improvement. He also said the release of HKS’s IMPACT framework — a set of strategies to improve diversity and inclusion at the school — was done without student input.
Benson added that the school often “conflates inclusion of conservative viewpoints with inclusion of marginalized people,” which he said “hampers meaningful progress” on anti-racism and diversity efforts.
Placeres also said full need-based financial aid is essential to diversity efforts. Students have long argued that the lack of a need-based financial aid system reinforces socioeconomic inequities and prevents minority and low-income students from attending HKS.
“It’s kind of ridiculous that we don’t have it given that it’s a public service-oriented school,” Placeres said.
“The school needs to shoot for, at minimum, being an accurate representation of this country in terms of the U.S. students,” Placeres added. “Until they do that, I don’t know how they can pose as being anti-racist or as trying to counteract racial inequality in this country when I think they’re perpetuating it.”
Last month, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced in an email to affiliates that the school would allocate an additional $2 million per year for financial aid “beyond the increases anticipated to address rising costs.” Elmendorf wrote that “continued fundraising” would be needed to meet the full financial need of every student.
Cabalquinto wrote that “fundamental changes have been made across the School’s most critical areas, including faculty recruitment processes, admissions and financial aid, and teaching and curriculum.”
“We will continue to collectively build a better Kennedy School,” Cabalquinto added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Family-owned Dominican restaurant Las Palmas Restaurant & Catering celebrated the opening of its third location two weeks ago, joining Blackbird Doughnuts and Sally’s Sandwiches in the Smith Campus Center’s remodeled arcade.
Its menu includes a variety of empanadas, customizable rice bowls, and tropical juices, as well as Dominican desserts like tres leches cake and caramel flan.
The restaurant takes up the space previously occupied by European-inspired bakery chain Swissbäkers, which abruptly closed in December 2019.
Harvard students can receive a 10% discount on their order with their student ID.
Roberto and Seila J. Green opened their first Las Palmas location in Roslindale, Mass. in 2018. Following the success of their first store, the pair opened a second Las Palmas location at the MIT Stratton Student Center in September 2021.
Seila said she and her husband are passionate about bringing authentic Dominican food to the Square.
“When this project came about, I thought it was a great idea, so people can know our culture, where we come from, and taste different flavors,” she said.
The restaurant gave out free empanadas to the first 100 people who stopped by the new location in a promotional event on Nov. 3.
According to its website, Las Palmas is committed to combating food insecurity. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has served thousands of individually packaged meals to hundreds of families in Boston.
Janet Hernandez ’24 said the Caribbean cuisine on the store’s menu is a welcome alternative to the offerings of existing Latin American restaurants in the area.
“I know that a lot of other first-gen, Latino students are really glad that finally there’s an option other than El Jefe’s and Felipe’s, which is traditionally Mexican food, especially those coming from a Caribbean background, like myself,” she said.
“Cuban food is very similar to Dominican food, so I thought it was a great idea that they opened it up,” she added.
Hernandez said she has visited the restaurant twice since its opening.
“The price is pretty affordable for how much food they give you,” she said. “It’s comforting to hear staff speaking Spanish also.”
Hernandez added that she has struggled to find Caribbean restaurants in Boston.
“Food is a way to connect back with your culture, especially being in a place like Cambridge, where there’s a lot of Mexican representation in terms of cuisine, but it’s been really difficult to find homey Cuban or Caribbean places, just in general around Boston,” she said. “I’m really happy that [Las Palmas] has become an option.”

The School of Public Health designated two additional gender-neutral restrooms in its Kresge building on Oct. 26, following student activism and widespread faculty support for the measure, per a Social and Behavioral Sciences department-wide email last week.
Prior to the change, HSPH had 19 all-gender restrooms across its four main buildings at the Longwood campus since June 2017, but only one was located in Kresge on the ground floor near its entrance.
Sam R. Mendez ’14, a PhD candidate at HSPH studying population health, said the all-gender restroom was the only one they felt “most comfortable” using. Mendez added the bathroom had long wait times due to its convenience and roominess.
Even Paglisotti, another PhD student in Population Health Sciences, said it takes them “far longer than most students” to find the nearest bathroom they can use.
“Especially in the middle of the day, in the middle of a class when you’re given a five-minute break, I’m guaranteed to miss lecture time while I’m running across the building to the nearest bathroom,” they said.
Mendez said difficulty using the singular all-gender restroom reminded them of their ongoing struggle with their gender identity.
“Every day it kind of felt like I was reminded just of that process of figuring that out,” they said.
Paglisotti said they noticed the dearth of all-gender restrooms as soon as they arrived on campus in September, and immediately raised their concerns at a Social and Behavioral Sciences department-wide meeting the same month.
PhD candidate Jen L. Cruz, who studies population health, said she was frustrated with how department faculty present at the September meeting — who unanimously supported increasing the number of all-gender restrooms — handled student concerns.
“What was said was, ‘We can’t change the facilities. They’re physical structures and we would have to go through the University,’” she said. “Our department has two floors, so it’s an easy fix, and it could just be a community decision.”
When more all-gender bathrooms were not designated in Kresge by late October despite overwhelming faculty support, Mendez said they decided to take matters into their own hands and change the signs themself.
“If everyone supports it, if we have the resources, it could be as simple as just saying that these are now gender neutral bathrooms,” they said.
Starting Oct. 22, Mendez took down a series of gendered bathroom signs on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th floors of Kresge and posted homemade signs designating them all-gender. They also put up flyers directing people to reach out to HSPH administration with any feedback.
Mendez also penned an open letter describing their personal experience to Public Health School Dean Michelle A. Williams and David R. Williams, chair of the Social and Behavioral Sciences department.
Michelle Williams replied to Mendez on Oct. 26, informing them that all-gender signage had been installed on the 5th and 7th floor bathrooms in Kresge.
David Williams sent out a department-wide email about the updated signs on Nov. 2, though a school-wide announcement has yet to be sent out.
Social epidemiology professor Nancy Krieger, who was present at the September department-wide meeting, wrote that she believes the change was made “relatively quickly.” She added that designating more all-gender bathrooms in Kresge is a “concrete, physical demonstration of a willingness” by the institution to be more gender-inclusive.
HSPH Master’s student Merida Brimhall said she hopes to see “all of the bathrooms” made gender-neutral and the removal of signs with images of gendered dress.
Jarvis Chen, a lecturer in the Social and Behavioral Sciences department, wrote in an emailed statement that HSPH must continue to work to improve the inclusivity and belonging of students, faculty, and staff identifying as part of sexual and gender minority groups.
“It should be noted that designating bathrooms as ‘all gender’ in no way removes facilities for use by cis-gender women and men in the community,” Chen wrote. “What does change is that trans and non-binary members of our community can feel comfortable using public accommodations and not feel excluded or unwelcome.”
HSPH will form a working group including non-binary and trans individuals to expand inclusive practices related to gender identity and access to gender-inclusive restrooms across campus, according to the school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After remaining closed for nearly two years, Houghton Library premiered its exhibition “Animals Are Us” — which explores the use of animal anthropomorphism in literature — to the public this semester.
Open from Sept. to Jan., the display “invites you to engage critically with animal anthropomorphism and delight in the artfulness ​​of this enduring genre,” according to the website for the Houghton Library, which houses the University’s rare book collection.
Visitors can see original manuscripts and illustrations from children’s literature, including a “suppressed” 1865 edition of Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland” and letters from author Beatrix Potter about her famed children’s book “The Tale of Peter Rabbit.”
The exhibition also holds the works of more contemporary children’s literature authors like Brenda Child, as well as a “Restoring Dignity” section, which contains animal illustrations from books that reframe American history “through the lens of Indigenous people.”
Anne-Marie Eze, chief communications officer for the library, said she believes people have criticized the animal anthropomorphism genre for being “one of the reasons why the children’s publishing route isn’t more diverse.”
“There are more books that have anthropomorphized animals or inanimate objects as protagonists than there are books that have protagonists of color, or disabled protagonists, or LGBTQ protagonists,” Eze said.
Eze added the literature in the exhibition encourages thoughtful engagement.
“It’s not the kind of children’s literature exhibition that panders to nostalgia,” she said. “We’ve tried to engage very critically with this genre of children’s literature.”
The introduction to the exhibition also references the controversy surrounding animal anthropomorphism.
“Librarians, teachers, and academics, particularly those of color, have long attributed the literary preference for animal anthropomorphism as a factor delaying diversification,” the introduction reads.
Eze selected two “experts” in children’s literature as curators for the exhibition — H. Nichols B. Clark ’69 and Meghan Melvin.
Clark currently serves as director and curator for The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, while Melvin curates for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
Zelin Liu ’22, who visited the exhibition on Monday, said he enjoyed its specific focus on children’s literature.
“Children’s literature doesn’t tend to get focused on very much in academic discussion, so it’s nice to see some attention given how important it is to people’s understanding of literature,” Liu said.
Liu added that he appreciated the chance to return to Houghton, which has been closed for much of his time as an undergraduate.
“Now that it’s open, it's great to be back here to look at all these wonderful rare books and see Harvard’s magnificent collection,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Coming off a pair of exhilarating conference victories on home ice over the weekend, the Harvard men’s hockey team failed to sustain its momentum across the Charles River at Northeastern on Monday night.
No. 10/6 Harvard (4-1, 3-0 ECAC) fell to the No. 17/RV Huskies (8-2, 4-2 Hockey East), 2-1 in overtime, marking its first loss of the 2021-22 season.
Harvard was caught flat-footed at the start of its first overtime period of the season Monday, allowing Northeastern to score the game-winning goal just seconds into the five-minute extra frame. Northeastern forward Gunnarwolf Fontaine broke a 1-1 tie 25 seconds into the 3-on-3 OT, putting the first blemish on Harvard’s record and delivering the Huskies a galvanizing two-point victory in front of the raucous 4,018 fans who filled Matthews Arena.
Fontaine collected the puck in his own zone before getting past a pair of crossed-up Harvard skaters to get out on a breakaway. The 5-foot-10 sophomore then rifled a shot from the slot past Harvard goalie Mitchell Gibson on the glove side.
“We just got crossed up a little bit,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I think [Northeastern defenseman Jordan Harris] kind of got behind one of our forwards and then we just got caught a little flat-footed, and he cut back to the middle and they were in. It was a nice play by them, but certainly not great defense.”
The NCAA implemented the five-minute, 3-on-3 overtime format last winter, moving college hockey to an OT style similar to the NHL’s. Monday marked the first time the Crimson had played in a 3-on-3 overtime period after the team missed last winter due to Covid-19.
“I started carrying it up and I saw that I had some time,” Fontaine said. “[Harris] just kind of stretched the zone and took both D with him. They kind of collided with each other, and I kind of got the breakaway from there.”
Harvard failed to capitalize on several opportunities in the latter stretch of the game, including a five-minute man-advantage during which the Crimson mustered just four shots on Northeastern goalie Devon Levi (20 saves).
“We had chances to get that second goal,” Donato said. “We just didn’t generate enough shots and second opportunities. ... Levi is a heck of a goalie, but I think we needed to put some pucks on him and get to some rebounds. We just didn’t do that often enough.”
The game started as a defensive battle, with the two teams combining for just nine shots in the first period.
“I thought both teams were kind of feeling each other out in the first period,” Donato said.
Harvard junior defenseman Henry Thrun started the scoring with a power-play goal just over four minutes into the second frame. Thrun buried a one-timer, redirecting a pass from Casey Dornbach through Levi’s five-hole to put Harvard up 1-0.
After giving up the power-play goal, Northeastern successfully killed off nine minutes of Harvard power play time, leaving the Crimson 1-for-4 on the man-advantage in the game.
“As a PK unit, we just took it one entry at a time,” said Levi of the Huskies’ penalty kill. “We were on the PK for a while, so it kind of sets you in a bad mindset if you look at the whole time you have to kill, rather than in increments. … The PK was unbelievable tonight, blocking shots for me. It was really cool to watch.”
Northeastern junior defenseman Jeremie Bucheler knotted the game at one with three minutes remaining in the second period. The Huskies got on an odd-man-rush, allowing Harris to feed a pass through traffic to Bucheler, who redirected the puck into the net from in the crease.
“We just have to be a little bit more sound defensively,” Donato said. “We got trapped in, gave up a 3-on-2 on their first goal. That’s just not intelligent hockey. So, we’re learning as a team.”
Harvard’s first loss came just two days after its offense came alive for five goals in a blowout win over Colgate Saturday. Harvard forward Alex Laferriere put on a show in the contest, scoring four consecutive goals en route to the Crimson’s 5-1 victory.
Laferriere, who had not scored this season prior to Saturday, turned a 1-1 game into a four-goal lead, capitalizing on his line’s strong passing game to deliver a Texas hat trick.
“I think, overall, the weekend was a good weekend for us as far as learning some lessons against some good teams that pushed us: on Friday night, Cornell, and then tonight, Northeastern — a dangerous offensive team, a good defensive team, very strong goaltending,” Donato said.
“We’re learning as a team,” he added. “Obviously, we’d like to win the [Northeastern] game in overtime, or win the game late on one of the power plays. But we’ll learn from it, lick our wounds, and get back on it this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two long days after Harvard completed its regular season with a win at Columbia, the Crimson can finally exhale. On Monday afternoon, Harvard (12-2-1, 5-2-0 Ivy League) learned that it earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, where it will join Ancient Eight rivals Brown and Princeton. The Crimson will travel to face Wake Forest (15-5-0, 7-5-0 ACC) in Winston-Salem on Sunday at 1 p.m.
“There are few better feelings as a college athlete or coach than seeing your name called on Selection Monday,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “It was great to be in a room together with the team and the team behind the team — our administrators and support staff — to be able to enjoy that moment. It was pretty special.”
While Harvard remained in the top-20 of the NCAA’s rating percentage index (RPI) throughout the season, its inclusion in the field of 64 teams was by no means a foregone conclusion. No Ivy League school had earned an at-large bid to the tournament since Dartmouth in 2005, and the Crimson was behind not only automatic qualifier Brown but also at-large candidate Princeton in the pecking order. In the end, all three schools made it, taking the sting out of Harvard’s 1-0 home losses to the Bears and Tigers and giving the conference its first three-bid season since 2004.
“It’s such a credit to the league and to the programs within the league,” Hamblin said. “Especially when you think about the fact that none of the Ivy League teams had a season last year. That we’ve been able to come back and not only hit the ground running but really have a ton of success just goes to show the direction the league is going in. For all of us in the league it’s an incredible achievement. We’re all lifting each other up, and I’m hoping that this is going to set a new precedent that the Ivy League is going to have more than one entry into the NCAA Tournament for years to come.”
The Crimson’s resume was bolstered by its undefeated record against a competitive non-conference schedule that featured schools from the ACC, Big 12, and Big East, as well as MAAC champions Monmouth, whose 43rd rank in the RPI made the Hawks the best team Harvard defeated. Beyond its impressive record and wealth of decent victories, the Crimson outshot and out-possessed its opponent in every game this season, and usually did so by a wide margin: Harvard managed double-digit shots in all 15 of its games and conceded more than nine shots just twice, against Kansas and Dartmouth. On the season, the Crimson outshot its opponents by a per-game margin of about 19-8.
Harvard dropped the two biggest games of its regular season, though, and will have to show that it is ready to win tight, tense games like the battle in Winston-Salem seems sure to be. While the Demon Deacons were picked to finish just ninth in the brutally difficult ACC, they followed up a cream puff non-conference slate with a strong ACC regular season performance, finishing tied for sixth with perennial powerhouse North Carolina. Wake Forest then upset Duke — a top seed in the NCAA tournament — in the first round of the ACC tournament before falling in the semifinals in overtime to Florida State, the top overall seed and consensus top team in America.
“They have been playing incredibly well of late,” Hamblin said. “They’ve been tested and have performed against some of the best teams in the country. But that’s why we do this. We want to put ourselves on the national stage and see where we’re at. We both like to play possession style soccer and it’s a beautiful big field down there, so I think you’re going to see two teams going after it.”
The Demon Deacons enter the game freshly ranked by the coaches’ poll last week, and while by RPI they — at 27th — are actually marginal underdogs, the Crimson knows that it is in for a tough game in which the margins will be very slim. Wake Forest’s sophomore goalie Kaitlyn Parks has eight shutouts on the season, tied for most in the powerhouse ACC, which produced nine tournament teams and three of the four top seeds.
The winner of this finely poised matchup will likely face Michigan, the second seed in Florida State’s region. A win would send Harvard past the first round of the tournament for the first time since 2014, when the Crimson thrashed Central Connecticut 6-0 before falling 7-0 to first seed UCLA in the second round.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a difficult overtime loss to Clarkson on Saturday, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team bounced back with a dominant 5-2 victory over Boston College on Tuesday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The victory over No. 7 BC (6-3, 4-2 Hockey East) continued a strong start to the season for the No. 10 Crimson (5-2, 3-2 ECAC), which has only two losses — both of which have come in overtime.
“We possessed the puck really well, we maintained control of the offensive zone quite a bit tonight, and I thought our defense played really well in transition,” said Harvard head coach Katey Stone of the win over BC. “All the way around, I thought we played pretty well.”
The game started very slowly, with both teams struggling to generate shots and maintain consistent offensive zone pressure. The Crimson was felled early by a checking penalty on first-year left wing Paige Lester and some sloppy defensive zone play, including several turnovers leading to Boston College scoring chances. However, Harvard’s top line of junior Anne Bloomer, junior Kristin Della Rovere, and senior Becca Gilmore was able to start generating offense halfway through the first period, culminating in a goal by Bloomer with just one second remaining in the first frame. The junior scored off of a deflection on a shot by first-year defender Mia Biotti.
“Anything with under two minutes at the end of the period is pretty significant, and that gave us a good jump in our step,” Stone said.
Despite the late goal, the Crimson started the second period on its heels, with the Eagles able to maintain consistent offensive zone pressure. BC forward Abby Newhook scored the Eagles’ first goal of the game on a rebound in front of the net, knotting the game at one. Harvard responded minutes later, however, on a power-play goal by junior defender Maryna MacDonald, who buried a wrist shot from the top of the faceoff circle. The Crimson’s top line — which consists of Bloomer, Della Rovere, and Gilmore, who also make up part of the top power play unit — posted seven points on the night.
“I think we have 10 great players on both power plays, so we don’t try to hone in on one thing and be robotic out there. We have a one-man advantage, and we just try to see the plays on the table,” Gilmore said.
The Crimson added another strike from Gilmore with three minutes left in the second period and appeared poised to take a 3-1 lead back to the dressing room at intermission, but the Eagles scored on a slap shot from the point by defender Alexie Guay with one second remaining in the period. The play was reviewed for goaltender interference, but the goal was upheld.
“We kind of let them back in in the second half of the second period,” Stone said. “BC is good, and they put a ton of pressure on you, and sometimes it comes down to making the simple play versus the fancy play.”
Despite the late second period tally by the Eagles, Harvard came out roaring in the third, outshooting BC 15-3 over the final frame. Gilmore added her second goal of the game on a backdoor tap-in on the power play, and senior forward Dominique Petrie sealed the win with a goal on a 2-on-0 breakaway.
“I think we're always smiling, and we make mistakes and practice, but we're there for each other to support each other and talk through it on the bench,” Gilmore said.
Both Stone and Gilmore lauded the team’s chemistry despite the year off due to Covid-19, pointing out that many of the team’s players have played together before prior to coming to Harvard. Gilmore praised the team’s first-year players for the energy and chemistry they have brought this year.
“All of them play a big role on this team, and they bring so much energy to the bench,” Gilmore said. “They go out there and we trust them and they know what to do.”
Despite the year off, the team’s energy, chemistry, and level of play has Stone confident that this year could be a big year for the program.
“I think they just love it. They're so fired up to be back,” Stone said.

Whoop whoop! Grab your Oreos and Trader Joe’s Takis because it’s 8 p.m. on Tuesday night a.k.a the best hour of your life a.k.a Bachelorette time! And nothing is better than The Bachelorette ...except maybe The Bachelorette: Harvard Edition. Here’s everything around campus getting a rose tonight!
Rose: The SciCenter’s Hidden Gem
The first rose goes to Buckminster’s Cafe! It’s such a shame that it’s tucked away in the back of the Science Center because Buckminster’s absolutely steals the show. The chai latte is heaven, the baked goods are scrumptious, and they accept BoardPlus. What’s not to love? I know Buckminster’s Cafe is here for the right reasons, so let’s just skip the rose ceremony now and get straight to the wedding. Forget about the night trip to MQC. Close the endless Canvas tabs. Take a helicopter to the Bahamas. It’s time to tie the knot.
Rose: Late Night HUDS Heroes
Brain break HUDS workers receive my next rose. They are gems, working hard and late into the night. They deserve more recognition and appreciation for all that they do for us. They care for us and keep us fed when we’re working on our seventh pset of the day, so make sure to appreciate them the next time you see them. Plus, they might give you the last bit of apple pie leftover from dinner (unless the rats get to it first).
Rose: The Coziest Chairs on Campus
Widener looks grand on the outside, but it’s more than just that! Have you sat in the green-reading chairs in the reading room? They receive my rose 100%. After sitting in cramped lecture hall chairs and passing out on the hardwood floors of your dorm while working on your 1000th essay of the day, your tush will relish in the plushy cotton depths of the reading chairs. I don’t blame you if you sleep your whole day away in these incredible chairs. In fact, just don’t pay for your room in your term bill and live in the chairs. It’ll save you $3000 a semester.
Of course, what’s Bachelorette without the losers? There’s more than a few things that I would send away from campus forever in a limo, but I’ll narrow it down to just three:
Yeet: Crappy Yard Lamps
Goodbye lamps in the Yard. They either don’t light up at all or have the strength of my night light from 3rd grade. This lack of light is not great for when it’s pitch black at 4 p.m. in the winter. I’ve gotten way too close to bumping into trees and people. It’s time to scrap all the lamps now and start anew – brand new, high-quality lights! Maybe they’ll make their debut in the Harvard edition of Bachelor in Paradise.
Yeet: Less-Than-Functional Dryers
The lamps are pretty bad, but so are the dryers. Sorry, dryers, but you don’t get my rose. You have one job... to dry clothes, but somehow you manage to spin around and around and make my clothes wetter. And the extra nineteen minutes of drying time? Doesn’t work. There’s no hope for anyone. Just start pinning up your clothes in your dorm now, preferably over the roasting hot heaters (what else are heaters for if not to dry your clothes?).
Yeet: Writing Utensils
I wish that paper and pencils would give me the old school feel of doing worksheets and homework in high school, but they just give me hand cramps. And don’t get me started on the eraser shavings pile when you start doing math. If you’re not erasing all of your work at least ten times and starting over from scratch, then you’re not doing math right. It’s time to part ways, paper and pencil. Farewell...I won’t miss you (And think about all the trees I’m saving!).
Alas, I have no such power over campus, so I’ll have to settle for watching Michelle find true love. This season is just getting started, and it is the MOST DRAMATIC one yet... That is, until next season!
