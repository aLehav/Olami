After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clover Food Lab aficionados questioning the future of the Harvard Square storefront may fear no more: the beloved local vegetarian restaurant will move to the Massachusetts Avenue building previously home to Yenching restaurant.
The restaurant will relocate just a few steps from its current spot to 1326 Mass. Ave. within the next couple of months, according to Shane Jones, an assistant manager of Clover’s Harvard Square location.  Yenching, a Szechuan-style Chinese restaurant and Harvard Square staple, previously occupied the location until late November when the restaurant closed its doors after 40 years
Harvard owns the Mass. Ave. storefront, and University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke confirmed Clover’s impending move to the new location.
Clover is one of several Harvard Square business being displaced by the Smith Campus Center renovations, which are slated to begin this spring and last until 2018. Many business housed inside the Smith Campus Center have already moved out of the space, including Harvard Student Agencies’ cleaner operations and a branch of the Harvard University Employees Credit Union.
The lease for Clover’s current space inside the Smith Campus Center lasts until April, but Clover plans to move out before the lease expires, Jones said.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said although the eatery Clover has found a new venue, businesses that require larger spaces are having trouble finding locations in the Square.
“We hope that all of the businesses being displaced because of the renovation of the Smith Campus Center can find places in the Square,” Jillson said. “We’re so cramped in Harvard Square and there is so little space available.”
Clover itself will be downsizing from its current two-story location to the smaller single-floor Mass. Ave storefront. The restaurant plans to construct a more efficient and smaller kitchen similar to those at the five other Clover restaurants in the Boston area, Jone said. The restaurant also plans to redesign the space, Jones  said.
“There is some talk of knocking down a wall and having some light come in,” Jones said.
Some Harvard students expressed relief that Clover—both a late night and early morning favorite— has found a new space. Still, Desmond L. Green ’17 acknowledged that the new location might take some getting used to.
“It will be kind of weird to have it on Mass Ave,” Green said. “There was something alternative about its location that fit its alternative eating options and chill vibes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Saturday night in the Ivy League is what it is,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Senior forward Alex Rosenberg hit an off-balance, turnaround jumper from the left elbow to beat the buzzer and lift Columbia (14-6, 4-0 Ivy League) to a 55-54 victory over Harvard (9-11, 1-3) on Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion. In a wild contest that featured five ties, four lead changes, and a lopsided run by each team, Rosenberg’s prayer was the difference in the Lions’ first road win against the Crimson since 2008.
After trading positions on the seesaw, captain Evan Cummins put Harvard up one with 1:18 to play. With his team struggling to find an open shot, senior forward Patrick Steeves was fouled with just 35 seconds to go. The Montreal native missed the front end of the one-and-one, giving Columbia a chance to use the clock to its advantage. Star Lions guard Maodo Lo clanked a three-pointer off the back rim and the Crimson corralled its 41st rebound of the contest with 10 ticks to go.
With a chance to put his team up by three, junior guard Corbin Miller, a career 76 percent free throw shooter coming into the game, missed the front end of the one-and-one. Junior forward Jeff Coby smothered the rebound and found Lo, who had been quiet for much of the game, in stride. With Harvard not having a chance to foul, the senior gave up his dribble, found Rosenberg, and a few seconds later a mosh pit of Lions had taken over the back corner of Lavietes.
“It’s a little bit of a chaotic broken floor,” Amaker said. “The thing about it is we had a foul to give and that’s what we had talked about. Obviously, those situations can happen very fast but we should have done that, I guess we weren’t close enough to do it and you get to the point where you don’t want to foul in the shooting motion, so that’s tough.”
Despite only scoring 21 points in the second half and having junior forward Zena Edosomwan on the bench with an apparent leg injury, the Crimson had its chances to put Columbia on the ropes down the stretch. The missed free throws by Steeves and Miller kept the door open for the Rosenberg heroics. On the season, Harvard is shooting 58 percent from the charity stripe, including a 47 percent mark since conference play began.
“[We] weren’t able to cash in and that’s been something that’s haunted us all year,” Amaker said.
The Crimson entered the halftime break with a 33-17 edge after the team outrebounded the Lions, 24-11, and held Columbia to a 24 percent shooting clip. The guests roared to a 16-4 run to start the second frame and took its first lead of the contest with 7:25 to play. Harvard overcame a 15-point halftime deficit against Cornell on Friday night, but with the roles reversed against the Lions, the Crimson once again came up short.
Neither team held a lead bigger than four after the under-eight media timeout. Cummins picked up his fourth foul midway through the second half, but freshman forward Weisner Perez answered the call for Harvard. The Berwyn, Ill. native finished with ten points in seven minutes. The freshman kept the Crimson in the game, connecting on two key three-pointers and scoring eight straight points as the undersized four and Columbia traded buckets down the stretch. It was the first time Perez had scored since the team’s Jan. 12 win against Ryerson.
“It was huge,” Cummins said. “Coach always tells him to have faith in his jumper. For a freshman being ready to step up and hit a few shots like that, that was definitely big for us.”
Harvard was in the contest at the end primarily due to a first half in which it stymied the Lions on both ends of the floor. Seven different Crimson players scored before intermission and the team looked possessed defensively following its cold performance down the stretch against Cornell.
“I was really proud of our guys because we talked about how this night was going to say a lot about who we are and I think it does,” Amaker said. “There’s no question with the energy and the effort the kids played with and I thought we were sensational defensively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With victory in its grasp, the Harvard men’s basketball team (9-11, 1-3 Ivy League) finally saw its flaws catch up to them.
After leading by 16 at the break, the Crimson scored just 21 points after intermission and missed the front end of two one-and-ones with under a minute left that would have sealed the win against the Columbia Lions (15-6, 4-0). Columbia, who memorably lost to Harvard on a Siyani Chambers ’16-’17 buzzer beater last year when they visited Lavietes Pavilion, got revenge a year later when Alex Rosenberg drained a jumper as time expired, leading Columbia to a 55-54 win.
“I thought we played with a great deal of resolve and determination and I’m so disappointed for our kids not being able to get this win after last night,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “… Sometimes you kind of need the W to validate some of the things you’ve been saying.”
FREE THROW TROUBLES
A theme throughout the early Ancient Eight schedule for the Crimson has been the foul shooting of its best players. Through three games, Harvard is just shooting 50 percent  from the charity stripe. On Saturday, despite junior Zena Edosomwan, the team’s highest volume shooter, making three of his four attempts from the charity stripe, the team made just seven or its 13 shots from the foul line.
“We talked about this is going to show a lot about our team and character and I thought they did that in a lot of different ways,” Amaker said. “It’s a nip and tuck game. Rosenberg hit a very tough shot to win it and it’s very unfortunate for us.”
The most damaging misses came in the last minutes, when both senior Patrick Steeves and junior Corbin Miller—who both shoot better than 40 percent from long range—missed the front end of one-on-one opportunities. Miller, who was fouled with seven seconds to go after Columbia senior guard Maodo Lo missed a three-pointer that would have given Columbia the lead, had a crucial miss that led to the Rosenberg game-winner.
“I think tonight it was on us and it was about us,” captain Evan Cummins said.
Rosenberg’s final shot came as a bit of redemption. The Lions forward made a would-be against the Crimson two years ago in Levien Gymnasium, but a controversial charge call overturned it. Laurent Rivard ’14, who drew the charge, went on to hit crucial shots down the stretch as the Harvard exited New York with a season-defining double-overtime, 88-84 win over the Crimson.
On Saturday, Rosenberg got his revenge, draining a shot in the lane as time expired to send the Lions to their first win over Harvard in six attempts.
“Coach told us that we had one [foul] to give so I should’ve stepped up,” Cumins said. “I was thinking I had foul fouls, I should have taken it before he has a full head of steam and make them take the ball out.”
REVITALIZING THE LINEUP
One of the few highlights down the stretch for the Crimson was freshman Weisner Perez. The rookie had not scored in Ivy League play before Saturday night’s matchup, handing in six ineffectual minutes in the first three games, including a no-show in Harvard’s last road contest against Dartmouth. However, after his team had blown a 16-point halftime lead, Perez got started.
The freshman, who has been willing to take long jump shots all year, started his second-half scoring with a three from long range with 6:06 left in the second half. After his first three gave Harvard the lead, his second put the Crimson up again by three with less than four minutes to play.
“It was huge. The stretch he provided was amazing.” Amaker said. “I just mentioned to our staff that I was really disappointed we didn’t get the win because he would’ve been as much the reason why as anyone and I wish he could have been able to get credit for that.”
For the game, Perez had 10 points in just seven minutes, his most productive effort since scoring 15 points at Kansas in a 75-69 loss in December.

#ComptheCrimson because yes, you too can be a tacky cartoonist. It’s a joke that’s been done before. This Saturday morning, the campus was greeted with a load of recycled humor, with just a sprinkle of good material mixed in. Well, most of the campus...sorry to all the folks in Kirkland who got skipped over. You didn’t miss much.
Throughout most of the year, Flyby—and the Crimson in general—is too busy producing actual content to give much thought to The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. The fact is that they simply aren’t funny; have you ever flipped through one of their magazines? It’s the sort of humor that only people who spend their time in a castle plastered with basic neon signs would appreciate.
Every now and then, though, they get lucky. Like this summer, when they pranked Donald Trump—that was actually funny. And occasionally, some freshman slips into the organization and gives them a dose of material not yet tainted by their dry humor.  This gets passed off as an annual spoof of the Crimson, something almost as funny as that cat video on Facebook that your mother just tagged you in.
The highlights:
ISIS gets Turnt: Only at Harvard do we find people willing to take that extra step and turn the recruiting videos for a terrorist organization into a spoof on housing day promos. All day yesterday, we were lowkey expecting some freshman to not realize the paper was a fake and drop a tip to the government that Harvard is in league with ISIS.
Dean Khurana, Denial is the First Step: Best quote: “Sometimes I’ll give the Fox a quick glance,” a noticeably blushing Khurana confessed. Khurana was otherwise unable to comment for this article, replying to most questions with: “Clubs? What clubs?” 
Self-Important Op-Eds: “Maybe It’s Time to Stop Checking Our Phones and Start Checking Our Privilege?” Yeah, this one actually doesn’t feel too far from the truth—can’t you just imagine some drunk section kid slurring this to you at a party between rounds of slap-cup? Never mix socializing with your class readings, kids. Also deserving a mention is the “Black Lives Matter by the Poster Boy for White Guys,” in which a probably yacht-loving, sperry-wearing, Vineyard-Vines-loving bro opines on the Black Lives Matter Movement, probably fresh off of the golf course at his country club. He’s just glad he could contribute to the conversation.
An Abundance of (re)Virgins: Hands down the best article. This one goes out to all the Yik-Yak stalking, friends-with-benefits searching thirsty folks fiending for a quickie in the stacks who have been thus far unsuccessful. Props to the survey respondents for finally checking their emails.
Bottom line: if you want to be part of an organization that only sporadically (read: once a year) posts funny content, then comp the Lampoon. But if you want to be a part of the Harvard College’s OG publication—and join your favorite student life bloggers here at Flyby—show up at 14 Plympton St. this Monday and Wednesday at 7 p.m. See you there!

Love It: "HUDS is Now Sort Of, Almost Classy" by Hyemi Park
Let’s talk business—the new flavored water machines in the d-halls are the best things to have happened to HUDS since its website redesign (we at Flyby are very invested in all things HUDS if you couldn’t tell).
Maybe you didn’t even notice the machine. Maybe you are a die-hard Powerade drinker (ew) and couldn’t care less. Maybe you’re thinking it’s “just” water. If so, you need to ditch your unenthusiastic outlook on life because this is exciting.
First off, these flavored water machines are particularly life-changing to people like me, who simultaneously hate water and feel guilty about not drinking enough of it. I’ve convinced myself that downing iced coffee is sufficient for my daily water intake if I wait long enough for the ice cubes to melt. This new addition is great because I can feel like I’m drinking something that isn’t water (read: tastes good!) but is actually good for me. Some of the flavors are also apparently enhanced with vitamins, which is amazing because the last time I actively took a vitamin supplement was in middle school circa the era of gummy bear vitamins.
Another plus is that you can probably incorporate them into your next low-budget pregame. You just invested all of your life savings into cheap handles that taste like rubbing alcohol, why would you want to go broke buying mixers at CVS? Try mixing your next shot of good old Rubinoff with the cucumber flavor, a dash of Ginger Ale, and ice for a poor man’s Moscow Mule. Or maybe try some rum with the sparkling raspberry flavor—yum! Just call these drinks cocktails and congrats, you’re officially the fancy bartender of your stuffy and sweaty dorm room pregame.
Finally, the sparkling water flavors make your HUDS meal ten times classier. It’s practically the equivalent of when you go to a restaurant and the waiter asks if you want tap or sparkling water and you splurge money on some San Pellegrino to feel luxurious. So the next time you have a gourmet meal of Apple Zings and red-spiced chicken breast with your roommates, you should toast to that with the new sparkling lemon water.

Hate It: "I Wish It Was Possible to Un-Taste That Abomination" by Kamara Swaby
I always do appreciate the effort HUDS has made in order to provide us with more options, (RIP bacon bleu cheeseburger from the grill). Even the “healthy” ones. So when I saw that there were additional drink choices in the dining halls, I was excited. We can’t all drink gallons of Diet Coke for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That being said, this group of new options are an evil done to human taste buds.
The lemon sparkling water is just heavily diluted, sugar free lemon lime Powerade. Even if you are a Powerade hater like Hyemi, you don’t deserve this water-downed monstrosity. The lime-mint one is a great alternative to mouthwash if one doesn’t like it too strong. And the cucumber is forgettable, at best. In general, the new selection tastes like regret and diet Capri Sun. Ever heard of diet Capri Sun? No, because it doesn’t exist, because it would suck.
Drinking the new water has in fact, made me want soda more in order to compensate for the disturbing flavor. I was so good at not drinking soda for ages. The minute after drinking the sparkling lemon flavored water, I ran back to get two glasses of regular Coke. Not even Diet Coke. Thanks, HUDS.
I definitely would not want to go to a party or a pre-game that served this instead of normal mixers. Sure, it may seem fancy and classy to drink Burnett’s vodka you had stored for 1 year with no chaser except for sparkling water. But will that matter when you regret your life decisions more than usual at 8 a.m. the next day?
If you look at how-tos for making flavored water, you will see that they actually use fruits. You know what fruits have? Natural sugar and great flavor. It would have been better if HUDS had made dispensers where they add actual fruits (don’t brag, Adams House) instead of this poor, poor substitute.
