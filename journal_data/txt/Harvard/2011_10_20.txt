After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s get this out of the way: “Cloud Cities”—the grand exhibition of Tomás Saraceno’s large-scale works in the foyer of Berlin’s largest contemporary art museum, Hamburger Bahnhof—is pretty. The gigantic translucent spheres seem to float against the white space of the museum. They fill up the spacious former train station with surprising ease, stretching from the floor and captivating the attention of visitors waiting in line for tickets. But for all the spectacle that “Cloud Cities” produces—including bouncing children, uneasy parents, and stern security guards—it is a particularly spectacular example of how contemporary art goes awry.
Participation seems to have become a buzz word in contemporary art. It is supposed to designate something new, something engaging and emancipatory in the relationship between viewer and artwork. But participation in artwork often turns out to be a lot like participation in brushing one’s teeth. You can do it wrong if you try, but the expectations and guidelines are pretty self-explanatory, and the results are not surprising.
Take off your shoes and your glasses, check your bag, remove any loose change, put all your things in the available clear plastic boxes. Wait in line and follow the directions. Climb the ladder, crawl around in a big plastic bubble, and look at the rest of “Cloud Cities.” There are a few more steps than brushing your teeth, but the way we encounter the works is structured by the works themselves. In this case, the “active encounter” is a mere routine masked by spectacle. Viewers are active; they climb and crawl. Yet they are in a gigantic plastic bubble. Goldfish in a bowl can move, too. Saraceno claims to liberate the spectator even as he shunts them into a role of passivity.
As it turns out, “Cloud Cities” is a perfect model of the experience it offers: here art is, quite literally, a plastic sterile bubble.  Ultimately “Cloud Cities” accomplishes only an elaborate and pathetic farce. It promises its consumers autonomy and alleges neutrality, but ends up siding with the culture and system already in place; it feeds our appetite for spectacular, instant gratification. Today we face unease, anxiety, fear, and protest. Meanwhile, art encourages us to stumble around in a massive luxurious bubble, absolves itself of any responsibility, and celebrates its own uselessness.
Even worse, it heralds this bland sterility as the image of paradise. According to the wall text, press releases, and interviews by Saraceno and the Director of the National Gallery in Berlin, Udo Kittelmann, “Cloud Cities” is, in some sense, a utopia. If “Cloud Cities” represents utopia, then utopia is expressed not as what is possible, what can be done, how we can change, where we could go, but instead as a landscape of abandonment and alienation—a vacuum of white space.
Participation in art can represent (and reprimand) society as it exists or as it could be. But there are no problems in “Cloud Cities” because there is nothing there.
Maybe this is what we want and all we deserve. Our lives are already a daily enactment of routine and a checklist of instructions; it’s no surprise that art has conformed to, if not itself facilitated, such regimentation. Art’s autonomy is limited, and the utopian possibilities of participation are vague. For the artist, to use the former to reach the latter is terribly difficult—unlike regurgitating stale buzz words. For the viewer, the few challenging works are estranging to encounter and impossible to consume, unlike art embodying ideas long digested and accepted. It’s easier simply to give viewers something to see, and to regiment the way they see it­­–to give them a big glass bubble and usher them inside.
Saraceno’s ‘utopias,’ on the other hand, are easily reproduced—as the Director of the National Gallery in Berlin, Udo Kittelmann, affirms: “The utopia that exists in [Saraceno’s] case is one that is necessary to be realized … So he will shortly head off and probably populate the entire planet with his habitable sculptural objects.”
Buy your piece of utopia today and move right on in tomorrow.

There is little room in the blogosphere for another comparison of Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party movement, but echoes resound in the empty space where neutral constructive criticism might be found. This approach seeks not to endorse one movement over another, but attempts to advise both sides equally. A leveled methodology is precisely what both movements need. Inflammatory protest rhetoric engenders negative feelings in the very people the movement needs to sway: potential converts and opposition policymakers with veto power. It would behoove America’s grassroots socioeconomic movements to reconsider the antagonism that forms the crux of their complaints. A more positive discourse might increase the movements’ appeals to the unconvinced and lead to more gains.
In the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, America witnessed the emergence of two general approaches advocating for racial justice: racial separatism, championed by Malcolm X, and nonviolent resistance, championed by Martin Luther King Jr. For most of his career, Malcolm X believed that “integration is hypocrisy” and, therefore, “separation not integration” would bring justice. While separatism supported the ideological and daily needs of African-Americans plagued by prejudice, its incendiary words and actions alienated the movement from the rest of America. Separatism remains an integral object of discourse, but history has shown that integration—rather than separation—has allowed today’s society to be structured with a great degree of racial justice. In 1963, King urged against separatism: “The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of white people, for many… have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny… that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.”
King’s potent message should ring now more clearly than ever. Throughout his life, King believed that hostility of word and action appeases the indignant and antagonizes the opposition. Change can only occur when the shared humanity—the “destiny” and “freedom” of the people as a whole—is brought to light. In My Pilgrimage to Nonviolence, King explains his “true pacifism”: “a courageous confrontation of evil by the power of love, in the faith that it is better to be the recipient of violence than the inflicter… [inflicting] only multiplies the existence of violence and bitterness in the universe, while [receiving] may develop a sense of shame in the opponent…a transformation and a change of heart.” Pundits and people speak of class warfare today. Must it come to warfare? It seems that much of America—and the world—is unhappy with the economy; OWS and the Tea Party share a sense of victimhood. Yet both factions point fingers incessantly in the blame game.
King’s perspective traces perfectly the sharp bipartisan divide between the grassroots left and right in America today. Protesters carrying hostile signs—whether directed at corporations or at government—are unlikely to gain any sympathy from those whose support they most direly need: the other side. It is just too easy to call out an enemy; antagonism abounds. The U.S. Day of Rage website declares that “Either our representatives are with us or the terrorists. Will they abolish corporate personhood?” To its own detriment, this branch of Occupy Wall Street effectively alienates moderates by creating a vicious binary. On the one hand is full agreement with the cause, and on the other is terrorism. One egregious—yet perhaps still representative—member of the Tea Party was caught on camera during a rally holding a sign that declared “Congress = Slave-owner, Taxpayer = N*ggar.” Thus, a reasonable cry for smaller government becomes overshadowed through devastating and derogatory language. Is it not hard, then, for a moderate to sympathize with either extreme? Both movements lack King’s principle of love, or hope that the opposition will want to incorporate itself into the movement’s realistic vision for the future—without being forced into it.
As the newer movement, Occupy Wall Street has received its share of scrutiny, especially for its apparently incoherent policy objectives. Yet in the “Declaration of the Occupation of New York City,” the General Assembly states an explicit and a singular call to action: “Assert your power. Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.” Open discourse is thus proclaimed the primary objective; as a result, the movement should not be criticized for not yet having policy objectives. From what we have seen in stagnant Congressional politics of late, open discourse is of the essence, for we elect our representatives much less frequently than we change our minds, in the world of Twitter and news flashes. Give the protesters time to figure out where their strongest and most universal purpose lies. Nevertheless, if a movement is to succeed they must both encourage all types of dialogue and embrace the people they despise the most—for their support is vital, their disapproval fatal. Every member of society must be incorporated into any realistic or practical vision for the future. While democracy is the vehicle by which every voice may be heard, it is the voices which attain universal respect—such as that of Martin Luther King Jr.—which are heard for generations to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the SAT is frequently questioned in regard to its effectiveness, it has recently sparked debate for a markedly different reason—revelations about high-profile cheating on the exam. The still-unfolding scandal involves an Emory University student allegedly using forged IDs to pose as high school students, taking the test in their stead. He was identified when officials compared the handwriting on six answer sheets, deducing the styles were identical. Despite earlier belief that this constituted an isolated incident, tensions have flared anew amidst the possibility that this is only a part of a larger, systemic issue.
With such emphasis placed on a single test, it seems inevitable that such a situation would transpire. However, the culprit is not the exam itself but the environment surrounding it. The SAT is currently one of the few options for standardizing what are incalculable disparities in educational quality across the country; we challenge those who condemn the exam to propose a comparable alternative that neither suffers from similar weaknesses nor falls victim to the discrepancies between rigor among America’s secondary schools.
The SAT fills the inescapable vacuum caused by the widespread lack of uniform educational standards and does its best to provide a level playing field in an environment that, despite what many may say or believe, is far from equitable. The SAT is not perfect, but it is the best option we currently have. Therefore, although the systemic problems responsible for the high-stakes nature of the SAT may persist, we should strive to do what we can to make taking the exam a fair experience for every student.
Primarily, the consequences for cheating on the SAT need to be reexamined. As it stands, students who cheat generally go unpunished—often the only result is a cancelled score. It borders on absurdity to deny that when provided a strong incentive to cheat and virtually no disincentives to cheat, some students will attempt to do so. The College Board must improve its security measures if it seriously aims to tackle cheating on the SAT.
Indeed, the current policy of the Advanced Placement Exams provides a viable model—students are heavily discouraged from cheating, as not only are schools notified, but also all test takers in the room have their scores invalidated, among other sanctions. Excessive? Perhaps, but it is certainly effective. Furthermore, test center security should be increased so it is not feasible to pose as six different individuals, including one of the opposite gender, in the same school district. With its ballooning revenues and student fees, the College Board has no excuse not to improve the security of its testing centers. It is an insult that students pay so much only to lack an equal opportunity at succeeding on this exam.
A fact one would be remiss to ignore is that the accused students paid up to $2500 for this individual’s services. Indeed, many parents pay significantly more for SAT tutoring designed to help students “game” the exam, despite the SAT’s stated goal to be an evaluation of aptitude, not subjective levels of preparation. Is there a significant difference between paying for either service? We leave such judgments to the reader. However, this incident illustrates the salient point that high-profile cheating, like many expensive tutoring services, are options exclusive to a certain socioeconomic level. One should not ignore the reality that there are ways to pay for a higher score, however illicit.
As it stands, we lack viable alternatives to the SAT; that does not mean that we should blindly accept all of its imperfections. If the College Board truly believes in leveling the academic playing field, it should not make it laughably easy to do otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around campus, people like to joke about how difficult it is to drop the H-Bomb. The story goes that the minute we tell someone we go to Harvard (“Oh, Haaarvard” comes the re-enacted reply), it’s all that they can see in us; they think it describes perfectly who we are.
The irony is that while the rest of the world certainly does factor one’s level of education into their assessment of an individual, Harvard students take the gold medal when it comes to mapping out our identities based on the four years spent bounded by the ivy-covered, not-just-any-Ivy-League walls. We are the first to say that all we are, all that we can be, is now and forever determined by our Harvard education.
This has only grown clearer to me as I’ve watched my friends stumble through senior year recruitment, searching for jobs while mucking through a terrible combination of insecurity and hope. To clarify: Their insecurities are many, their source of hope just one. Griping ranges from teary-eyed realizations that two leadership positions were not enough—“why didn’t I pick three?” we wail—to wishing that GPAs were just a half a tenth of a digit higher; from angrily demanding from God why some fathers are chief executives and others deadbeats, to tittering that if only we were beautiful enough would we just marry rich! And then, it hangs in the air for a second before washing over us with ephemeral relief: “At least I go to Harvard.”
By ephemeral I mean that only after a few seconds do the insecurities come scurrying back. In reacting to our dependency on this single anchor of encouragement, we hem and haw about whether or not graduating from the world’s top academic institution is enough to allow us to make a living, as if any outsider looking in would nod politely at such modest conversation.
Suppose we were to entertain for a moment the idea that we won’t attain a certain level of success in our postgraduate lives. After having accessed the bank that is Harvard College; after licking our last drops of money, knowledge, and power; after making connections with and to the renowned; after all that, are we seriously to believe that we’ll end up in the dark throes of an alleyway without a penny to our name?
None of this is meant to indicate that a job is easy to attain or that recruiting isn’t a difficult process. I, too, have friends who graduated last May with a Harvard diploma and are still unemployed. But eventually, they will find a job; eventually, we will too. And until we do, we have mountains of resources at our fingertips that are inaccessible to the vast majority of the population.
A job, I hope you’re beginning to see, is not at stake here. There is something more significant about the fact that as fearful contemplations mist in the back of our minds to the point of putrefaction, we cling to that single line on our resumes that yells at the world that we attend glorious Harvard.
It amazes me that this is all that we would ever lay claim to. If you died today, do you truly believe that this would be your legacy? “Here lies Danielle Kim, a Harvard woman, a woman who was accepted into and attended Harvard.” Would that be it? Is that all I want the world to write of me?
As Harvard students, we often demand so many unnecessary qualities from ourselves, none of which are vital to the formation of a healthy identity. We distill our lives, along with our peers’, into quick calculations based on GPA, appearance, and delightfully superficial titles.
It’s time that we man up and make something of ourselves. Ask yourself the hard questions. Who are you? Who do you want to be? What wakes you up in the morning, and who makes you smile? It’s neither fair to ourselves nor to those who love us to forget that we are worth something apart from our affiliation with Harvard. We have to begin looking inward to form a sense of self.
I’m 22 years old. I don’t know where I’m going. I don’t know who’s taking the trip with me. I don’t even know where I’m going to get money for fuel. But I know that a set of wheels identifiable only by the stamp of Harvard’s name is only going to hold up for so long.

To the editor:
I am flattered that such a distinguished and accomplished literary scholar as Professor Marjorie Perloff has commented on my recent column, “In Someone Else’s Words.” I welcome her response. In fact, as a 21-year-old columnist for The Crimson, I welcome any and all responses. However, Professor Perloff’s attacks are misguided and unfounded.
In Unoriginal Genius, Perloff claims that “the language of citation” is “the logical form of ‘writing’ in an age of literally mobile or transferable text” (4, 17). In light of this, I have to say that I am surprised that Perloff seems to view the hyperlink I included to her publisher’s website as an unacceptable or insufficient form of citation. If she takes issue with the actual content of my overview of the book, then I would urge her to bring up that concern with her publisher as well as with Professor Kenneth Goldsmith, who describes Perloff’s conception of “unoriginal genius” on the first page of his book.
I disagree with Perloff’s theory, and I take issue with her claim that Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project is a foundational example of citational poetry. Walter Benjamin never described his Arcades Project as poetry; Perloff’s description of it as such is conjecture and is hardly a sturdy pillar upon which to develop a theory of poetics. Kenneth Goldsmith does employ a tongue-in-cheek tone in order to poke fun at society’s views about plagiarism, but such a tone does not alter the basis of his argument and literary approach or my opinion of it: Professor Goldsmith still advocates unoriginality and re-appropriation of text, and, in his role as a professor, he strives to help his students become better copiers. Perloff says that I “get Goldsmith all wrong.” One example of a laudatory feature of Goldsmith’s work that I apparently do not understand is the way that Goldsmith shows “just how subtle ‘copying’ can be.” I do not misunderstand—I disagree. I do not think that subtle plagiarism should be applauded or encouraged.
I have read and thought about Goldsmith and his work, although perhaps the reading was unnecessary. Goldsmith says he wants a thinkership not a readership. According to him, it’s more important for people to think about his books, not to actually read them (Goldsmith, Kenneth. Kenneth Goldsmith. Interview by Dave Mandl. The Believer. Oct. 2011).

To the editor:
As two women of color who frequently reflect on race at Harvard, we were excited to see the recent Fifteen Minutes magazine scrutiny “Raceless Like Me,” by Zoe A.Y. Weinberg ’13. However, while we appreciate Weinberg’s opening up of a dialogue on race, we are concerned by the implications of presenting race transcendence as a viable theory for reconfiguring identity. We question whether one can think “beyond the boundaries” of race as the article’s subtitle suggests. To us, race transcendence seems like yet another means of talking around race, rather than dealing with race on an individual and social level. We resist scholars such as  Rainier Spencer’s push to replace work that has been done on race (a great deal of it at this institution) with a new concept that seems to hurry past the issue of racism in its aim of deconstructing race.
We credit Weinberg with presenting multiple perspectives on racial identity, but worry that there are major questions unanswered by her article. Does racelessness actively challenge racism? How does a person who is perceived as non-white but who identifies as raceless deal with racism in their personal life? Finally, how can one be embedded within a system and simultaneously above it? Leaving these questions unanswered allows Spencer’s theory to stand without much reproach, and we wish that more of his challengers in the academy had been given room to voice their opposition in this article.
Race is not a question of personal identification, even for people whose physical appearance makes checking a box difficult. This article emphasized the “box-checking” discourse; while filling out college applications or census forms presents an interesting moment for reflection, it is only a minor way in which our racial identities are constituted. Race is primarily about how others identify us. We wish that Weinberg had examined the multiple—and mostly involuntary—ways that we are racialized by larger structures intersecting with and informing our personal lives.
We do not think that society can move beyond race without a direct confrontation with it. While race transcendence starts a new conversation for understanding identity, we fear that it silences necessary discussions of race by marking them as antiquated. Despite our criticism, we are grateful for those who contributed to this article; it has opened a space for discussion that isn’t always easy to find here. We hope that we have contributed in our own way.

Engagements are awesome, especially when they’re fake.
When I went to a drag bar a couple of weeks ago, my friends and I decided to pose as a bachelorette party (it just felt right). As I watched my faux bride-to-be friend up on stage with our drag queen host talking about her “fiancé” Erik and their planned honeymoon to Bermuda, I thought to myself ... I could do this; I could jump up and down squealing about the five carat rock on my finger that he took on three jobs to pay for, giving up a fellowship to Nicaragua in the process; I could share an overly emotional moment in the ladies’ room about how everyone tells us we’re rushing into this but we just know it’s right. I’m 21 years old and I’m not looking to tie the knot any time soon, but after taking the plunge into fake-engaged life, I realized just how rewarding it could be.
For starters, being fake-engaged has made my parents respect me more. How could they not, given all of my future hubby’s enviable traits? Hell yes, my fiancé is a Boston Brahmin. He knows how to cook seared Hudson Valley foie gras with ginger gastrique and always opens doors for me. My mom doesn’t mind that she hasn’t met him yet; with all the hours he spends volunteering at the local synagogue teaching Swahili to children from underserved communities, he barely has time to apply to med school (he scored in the 98th percentile on the MCAT). My dad was a little suspicious until I told him that Ben doesn’t believe in premarital sex. Then he just stopped asking questions.
But the real reason I love being engaged is that it allows me to contribute a little community service of my own. Let’s be real: there are a lot of guys out there who would be tempted to hook up with an engaged woman, the forbidden fruit if you will. And under the influence of five screwdrivers and cold feet, the feeling can be mutual. By posing as an illicit apple, I am able to spare the heartbreak of countless grooms-to-be, intercepting these wayward pairs and coyly sneaking in to sweep the guy off his feet and into my sheets, What can I say, I’m a giver.

I’ve been asked a lot of questions in my life: “How are you?” “Are you drunk?” “Why are you crying?” but I’ve never been asked the one question that defines many lives: “Will you marry me?” And I’m totally fine with that, I swear. I don’t care that my dating profile doesn’t get hits from anyone other than 50-year-old wannabe producers, and I definitely don’t care that I’ve never been in a relationship for more than three days.
I’ve never been engaged and guess what: I don’t plan on it. I totally could; I’m just choosing not to.
Here’s my proposal: no one should ever put a ring on it. That’s because when people tie themselves down they become boring. They can talk about only one thing: being engaged. I know it’s shocking, but I don’t want to hear the four hour “romantic” story of how he proposed, while you two hold hands and finish each other’s sentences. The fact that he choreographed an interpretive dance that ended with a plane flying overhead, skywriting “I wuv you,” isn’t cute. It’s embarrassing to him and to you, not to mention the fact that it’s a waste of money, exhibiting poor budgeting skills. When you have to sell your ring to pay the electric bill, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Oh, I know. You’re “so in love” and “will be forever.” Forever is five years tops. But for now you want me to “ooh” and “aah” at the rock that will “never leave your finger.” I’ve seen diamonds before and let’s just say, I’m not impressed. The ring that you think is a symbol of commitment means one thing and one thing only: imprisonment. You’ve sold your freedom for a piece of carbonized coal.

Professor of Sociology Nicholas A. Christakis, a graduate of both Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, is one heck of a multitasker. In addition to teaching the popular undergraduate course Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the USA: Medicine and Disease in Social Context,” he is one of Pforzheimer’s two House Masters (his wife Erika L. Christakis ’86 completes the pair). Oh, and in his time off, he likes to do things like publish books, give Ted Talks, and teach at the Harvard Medical School. He also found time to talk with FM.
 
1. Fifteen Minutes: What got you interested in the study of social networks?
Nicholas A. Christakis: That’s a long story, actually ... In the 1990s I was studying something called the widower effect, which is the [phenomenon] that when your spouse dies your probability of death goes up. The widower effect has been studied since 1858 but if you think about it, the widower effect is the simplest case of a social network[ing] effect.
2. FM: Speaking of social networking, we see you have a Facebook page. Do you screen your friends?
NAC: I accept all incoming friend requests from Harvard undergraduates. I do not make any outgoing friendship requests because I think people would find that creepy. I like to have met someone in real life before being their Facebook friend.
3. FM: Last semester, your CUE guide score for Sociology 190 was an impressive 4.3. If you were to give your students a CUE score, what would it be?
NAC: Five, because I love Harvard students. It’s a scarce commodity to have a slot at this school. It’s important for students to take their studies seriously. It’s my general impression that this is the case.
4. FM: How did you become interested in the topic of palliative care?
NAC: My mother was seriously ill when I was a boy. She was diagnosed with a nasty kind of cancer when I was six, and she died when I was 25. My entire youth was spent with an incredibly ill parent ... I don’t think you can grow up that way and not be marked by that experience. One of the ways it marked me was it gave me an interest in medicine and end-of-life care. We don’t do a good job at giving end-of-life care in our society. It’s fashionable to speak about vulnerable populations in medicine and public policy, but it’s harder to find a more vulnerable population than those who are dying.
5. FM: In your recent book, “Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks,” you discuss the relationship between social networks and health. How do you think the way we as college students interact affects our health?
NAC: There are two ways that networks affect human beings. One is what we call “connection,” and one is what we call “contagion.” Connection has to do with the actual architecture around you. Contagion has to do with what is spreading through the network. Given a particular architecture of ties around you, what is flowing through the network? Is information flowing through? Or ideas? Or germs? Or is behavior, for example, binge drinking, flowing through the network? Is the probability that you are binge drinking affected by the probability that others around you are binge drinking? You can be affected by the structure around you, and you can be affected by what’s happening in the people around you.
6. FM: What is your favorite part about being a House Master?
NAC: The best part is that you get to dress up in ridiculous costumes, like the polar bear costume. For some reason the students are finding reasons for me to don this costume, and the number of reasons seems to be increasing every year. The other part I like is the opportunity to get to know students. Pfoho students will know it’s a secret we have up here that there are late-night candy runs. I’m not going to explain. You’re going to have to ask around.
7. FM: Be honest. Does it suck to be Quadded?
NAC: I was just so glad that I wasn’t Rivered.
8. FM: What’s your favorite HUDS dish?
NAC: I hope Erika, the [Pforzheimer] Co-Master, doesn’t read this, but my favorite[s are] the chicken nuggets and French fries.
FM: You’re an M.D. Should you be eating that?
NAC: I said that was my favorite. I didn’t say I eat it.
9. FM: Have you seen any crazy and unpredictable things during your time at Harvard?
NAC: Well, the most entertaining thing that Pfoho students have done is the Housing Day videos. Ours are surely the best on campus, far and away. This is a quote from Jane Austen: “It is a truth universally acknowledged that Pfoho Housing Day videos are the best.”
FM: You’re a Jane Austen fan?
NAC: I was ignorant; I used to think of it as chick lit. My wife made me read Jane Austen on my 40th birthday, and I couldn’t put it down. I couldn’t believe how lacking my education had been. Trust me, if you pick up “Pride and Prejudice” and read the first 20 pages, I guarantee you’ll finish it. It’ll blow your mind.
10. FM: You completed your undergraduate degree at Yale. How do you think Harvard’s undergraduate experience compares?
NAC: Any comparisons would be fairly uninformed [on my part]. I know a tremendous amount of what the undergrad experience at Harvard is like, but I don’t have a lot of information about what it’s like at Yale. It strikes me that Harvard students have a greater sense of humor. I am endlessly amused by Harvard t-shirts and pranks.
11. FM: What was the best class you took in college?
NAC: A class in anthropology where we studied deeply the Kapauku Papuans [an ethnic group located in Western New Guinea] and anyone in my family who reads this sentence will roll their eyes right now ... Let’s just say I remember a lot about the Kapauku Papuans.
12. FM: You have a Ph.D, M.D., and M.P.H. How have these three disciplines affected your view of the world?
NAC: I think the best academics are able to see how the questions in their own discipline relate to questions in other disciplines, and I think that innovation in knowledge emerges from the intersection of disciplines. I think we are in a special moment right now, in what I would call a rising importance of bio-social sciences, and I think that findings in biology will raise questions in the social sciences and push it.
13. FM: Let’s say alien invaders came to take over Earth, and forced you to relinquish two of your degrees. Which one would you keep, and why?
NAC: That’s like “Sophie’s Choice.” I couldn’t pick. I think I would choose death.
14. FM: You are involved with research, teaching, and House life. How many all-nighters did you pull this week?
NAC: I’m too old for all-nighters. As for lifetime prevalence of all-nighters, I would compare myself head-to-head with anyone, because between college, medical school, and residency, it’s a life of all-nighters. But at this stage of my life I don’t do all-nighters anymore. Zero all-nighters (laughs).
15. FM: You’re a complete baller. Did you know that?
NAC: (Laughs.) No, I did not know that. I feel very fortunate to enjoy the confidence of Harvard undergraduates.

I have a pet cactus, and his name is Earl. The truth is: I love Earl. In fact, I get along with him better than I do with the majority of people. Unlike humans, Earl doesn’t talk back or expect anything from me. He just sits on my windowsill and takes in whatever sunlight New England has to offer. He doesn’t bother making trouble with the other objects on the windowsill. He’s happy with just being himself—a tiny, green, three and a half inch long, photosynthesizing, spiny dick-shaped thing sticking out of the ground.
I’ve had Earl for a little over a month now. That’s about three percent of his life (Earl is three years old). I received him as a sort of “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” gift. My two best friends and I had known each other since the eighth grade. Unfortunately college placed some distance between us, as I was the only one who left Georgia. Right before we started sophomore year, the three of us met up again in my friend’s room. I noticed a cactus sitting on her desk, picked it up, and couldn’t resist cooing at it. “You should keep him,” she said, smiling.
So I did.
I was a bit nervous going to the airport. I was really afraid that they wouldn’t let him through because I know they usually don’t allow pets or plants on any international flight. But I figured—this is a domestic flight, and Earl wouldn’t hurt anybody ... his spines are fuzzy. But just in case something happened, I asked my parents to stand outside of the security line so that I could give them Earl if he couldn’t pass. They waited.
I walked up to the start of the security line and handed my ID to the man at the counter. He saw Earl in my hand, looked at me, and said, “You’d better not eat that thing—I hear they’re poisonous.” He smiled and let me through.
The real panic came at the security line. I didn’t think I could carry Earl in my hands through the scan. I couldn’t put him on the conveyer belt either because a million monstrosities could happen to him—he could get knocked off, he could get confiscated, he could get tipped over or caught in one of the grooves and lose all his soil. Luckily, I realized that I could nestle him inside one of the trays.
I went through the scan and looked back in anticipation at the man overlooking the scans. A few beats passed, and I knew that Earl was safe when the man turned back, gave me a weird look and shook his head. He was trying hard not to smile.
I pranced to my gate, with cactus in one hand and luggage in the other, smiling like a fool who just got laid.
Not only did does Earl behave extraordinarily well, but he has also made me a lot of friends. During the plane ride, I put Earl on the seat next to me while I was getting my things in order. Suddenly, I felt a shadow, and I looked up to see a 27-year-old guy standing over me. “Uh ... Why is there a cactus in my seat?”
We ended up talking for the whole plane ride from Atlanta to Boston.
Sometimes I take Earl on walks. The first thing I did when I got on campus was put on my best white cotton dress, fashionable pink sunglasses, gladiator shoes, and strut around school with my cactus. I made sure to cover lots of ground so that I could give him the full range of Harvard soil. Poor Earl barely had his roots covered when I first got him.
Sometimes I really worry about Earl. If a window is left open, he could get cold and shrivel. If there isn’t enough sun, he might get depressed and shed off his spines and die. One time, I took him on a walk and brought him to my boyfriend’s dorm on the other side of campus (I thought that giving Earl a father figure would inspire him to grow). I left Earl there overnight and was too busy for the next few days to bring him back to my place. On the third day, my boyfriend put Earl on the balcony outside his window so that Earl could get some full sunshine. When I came to his dorm and asked where Earl was, he pointed towards the window and I saw my little cactus nearly toppling over the ledge, as a breeze came through. I screamed and ran to save Earl’s life.
That same day I snuggled Earl into my basket next to some textbooks and a jacket and biked him all the way back to my dorm, which was about a mile ride away. Earl nearly fell out several times, and he lost about half of his soil by the end of the trip.
Since then, I have taken Earl on a few more additional walks (he now has full soil again). I put him back on my windowsill overlooking the Quad yard. Sometimes he has company—my neighbor has an aloe plant named Aloe, and for a while the two became companions—but mostly, Earl sits by himself on the windowsill.
After closely examining Earl so many times, I have decided that Cacti are fascinating plants. Earl, in particular, is a column-shaped cactus. His whole body is divided into ribs. These things are called tubercles, and each tubercle is covered in little white cushions called areoles which have spines protruding out of them. Spines can either be very thick, dense or fuzzy and light-colored. Earl has the latter. They’re more like thick hairs than spines, and they stick out in jumbled directions over his body. Earl has a tuft of hair at the top, which I pet a lot. This section, which I call the head, is also slightly greener than the rest of his shaft.
This part of Earl’s anatomy puzzled me for a very long time. But I looked at him closely again one day, and suddenly noticed that Earl had grown an extra areole on each of his tubercles. All of a sudden, Earl had grown four millimeters! Apparently, the top of the cactus contains many parenchymal cells, which have thin cell walls and are capable of frequent division. These allow the plant to grow. This is what Earl spends all his time on: he sits staring at the sun all day, gathering and photosynthesizing and collecting enough little molecules until he has enough to produce an extra areole. He secretes the new forms out of the tip of his head, and they gradually move down his body, like a beautiful, life-giving, slow motion ejaculation.
Cacti make especially good pets because they thrive off of negligence, which I provide a lot of. It can be very comforting to know that I can come back, regardless of what I’ve done or who I’ve become, and still have the same cactus waiting for me. To be honest, Earl never really changes because he doesn’t grow that much. I’ve long since given up on trying to make him become a macho cactus. Instead, I just try to keep him from dying. So I put him next to my sun box. It was originally supposed to be for me, to keep me happy when there is no sun, but I have found that keeping Earl alive is enough to keep me happy. In the end, we’re both just trying to live.

Feel like you’re fixing to die? Whether you’re headed to Dewey Square or kicking back to Coldplay in the comfort of your room, you’re not alone in your frustration. The same disgruntled Zeitgeist that propels today’s youth into the streets echoes in the beats and bass of generations past.
US:  Bob Dylan, “The Times They Are A-Changin’”
Written in 1963, during the heart of the civil rights movement, this song was recorded weeks before President Kennedy’s assassination. Dylan recalls performing it the next night: “Something had just gone haywire in the country and they were applauding the song. And I couldn’t understand why they were clapping, or why I wrote the song. I couldn’t understand anything.”The hand-written lyrics were recently sold for $420,500 in auction. The purchaser was a hedge-fund manager.
Czechoslovakia: Plastic People of the Universe, “Magické Noci” (Magic Nights)
Heavily influenced by the Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa, the Plastic People stood at the helm of Czechoslovakian counter-culture during Soviet rule. The band formed in the wake of a Kremlin crackdown on the liberalization which had occurred during the Prague Spring of 1968. Their 1974 album, “Egon Bondy’s Happy Hearts Club Banned,” thought to be one of their best, was covertly recorded in a Bohemian castle in 1973-1974 and later smuggled to the West, where it was first issued nearly four years later.
England: The Beatles, “Revolution”
This song came out of a potent period of student dissent, the Vietnam protests of 1968. An early example of Lennon’s political writing, it was written soon after he had met Yoko and as he was still coming into his own as a social critic. It expresses his doubts, based in part on the transcendental meditation he was practicing at the time, about the legitimacy of violent methods as a means of effecting social change.
Ireland: U2, “Sunday Bloody Sunday”
One of U2’s most politically-charged songs, the lyrics recall the infamous Bloody Sunday incident which occurred in Derry, Ireland in 1972, when British soldiers shot 26 unarmed civil rights protesters, killing 13.While earlier versions of the hit had a more political edge, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., said of the song: “Let’s forget the politics, let’s stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it ... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that’s the real battle.”

I. BATTLE FOR A BETTER BUTTER
In 1766—one hundred and thirty years after its founding—Harvard hosted the first recorded student protest in American history: a protest against butter. For decades, the quality of food in the College’s dining halls had been sharply declining. The student’s complaints about the food and particularly about the sourness of the butter fell lamely upon the ears of the College president, Edward Holyoke, Class of 1705.
So, on September 23, Asa Dunbar of the Class of 1767—the grandfather of Henry David Thoreau—mounted his chair and proclaimed: “Behold, our butter stinketh!—Give us, therefore, butter that stinketh not.” The majority of the student body heartily accepted this as their motto and echoed it over the course of the next month as the protests of the Great Butter Rebellion ensued.
In a fit of displeasure, President Holyoke demanded that the students turn in the instigators of the protest—along with Dunbar, the rabble-rousers included the entirety of the “Sons of Harvard,” a student offshoot of the “Sons of Liberty.” Since no student confessed, President Holyoke decided to suspend over half of the student body in hopes that someone would fess up. But again the students maintained their solidarity and said nothing.
Eventually the Board of Overseers stepped in, readmitting the suspended students and replacing the butter. Yet two years later, the dining hall food worsened again and the protests resumed with more aggression and fewer returns.
Following the Great Butter Rebellion, culinary remonstrations became a central component of Harvard’s protest culture, from the Bread and Butter Rebellion of 1805 through the Cabbage Rebellion of 1807 to the “Rebelliad” insurrection of 1819.
II. LIFE, LIBERTY, AND CABBAGE
The Cabbage Rebellion began after maggots kept showing up in the student’s cabbage soup. The disgruntled vegetable enthusiasts assembled under a tree at the end of Hollis Hall, which would later be called “Rebellion Elm.” The bedraggled students supplicated for better food, but following the suspension of 17 students, the unavailing protest ended in vain.
In 1819 a new generation of students returned to “Rebellion Elm” to make their own demands. Fed up with being poorly fed, the entire sophomore class dropped out of Harvard in the hope that doing so would spur some indignation among the administration. It didn’t and the defected students had to ask to be readmitted; only some were allowed.
These events would later be recounted as a parody epic poem of four cantos entitled “Rebelliad; or Terrible Transactions at the Seat of the Muses.” The poem was privately published and widely distributed among students. The conclusion to the prologue of the poem reads:
The combat deepens. On, ye brave,
 
And let the cooks the pieces save!
 
Wave, Goodies, all you besoms wave!
 
 
Inspire their souls with chivalry. 
Ah! few shall part where many meet
 
With anything but blows to eat,
 
And every dish beneath their feet
 
Shall be a supper’s sepulchre.
Such literary wit returned, foodless, in the fall of May 1952, just as things were getting political. Students gathered in the Yard to campaign for the comic strip character Pogo as a candidate for president. The students mocked Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “I Like Ike!” slogan with their own chant of “I Go Pogo.” The rally soon turned violent and the Cambridge city police arrested 28 students, all of whom were later released.
III. OCCUPY
And then, of course, there was Vietnam. In 1969, Harvard students took over University Hall in opposition to the escalating war in Vietnam. During previous bouts of war, such as World War I and World War II, there had been limited pacifist protests, which often faded dimly as the United States became more involved in the war. This time, however, the students were less patient.
The protest was led by the Harvard chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. Members of the group led about 300 students to the home of Harvard’s President, Nathan M. Pusey ’28, and tacked a list of demands to the door. The students targeted Harvard’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). Among the demands, they wanted ROTC to be dissolved and they wanted alternative scholarships for students enrolled in ROTC.
The students then crowded into University Hall and chained the doors shut. They pledged to only use nonviolent disobedience, but the University administrators decided to call in the city and state police: with clubs and mace, the police quickly broke up the rally and arrested over 100 students, but the protest did not end without reprieve.
The tenacious students moved to Memorial Church, now joined by outraged faculty. After an extended strike and a boycott of classes, the University eventually caved to the protestors’ demands.
The spirit of Vietnam was echoed in 2001, when nearly 50 students from the Progressive Student Labor Movement (PSLM) began a sit-in at Mass. Hall, pleading the administration for a “living wage” for University workers. “I think it’ll work,” one worker told The Crimson as he marched. “It’s worked in the past.” Later that year, Harvard began renegotiating contracts with its workers and raised most wages above the Cambridge living wage level.
Harvard students still take part in protests: pickets for labor rights, rallies for environmental protection, marches for the LGBT movement, and now the occupation of Wall Street and Boston. There will always different causes, met with different amounts of fervor or apathy—but it seems the rancid taste of butter lingers still in the mouths of Harvard youth.

The light hung low, yellow, and rich over Dewey Square and the fervent chatter of protesters. Clutching each other by the arms in a chain around the tent city, demonstrators in the square anxiously waited to see if the cops were really coming.
“We have our permit!” the protesters chanted. “It’s called the Constitution!”
In the background, hand-drums provided a steady rhythm—quick, but not too urgent. The energy was both unsettling and contagious.
By that point, protestors had been camped out in Dewey Square for about a week and a half. Some came and went between classes and work, while others hadn’t been home nearly all week. During the previous few days, a second camp had emerged on the adjacent street, carrying the same spirit: angry and jovial. Angry and jovial, for the record, is really the only way I can describe it. I’d been in and out of Dewey Square all day, until after the arrests started.
Rumors swirled around Dewey Square and on Twitter that the cops were coming to force protestors to leave at midnight. I set out to talk to people, but no one really seemed to know what was going on.
Every now and then, a passing siren would create a lull in the commotion. But, for the most part, the drums kept beating, and people kept smiling. A group of guys sat at the outskirts of the camp playing jazz, biding their time. Everyone was in good spirits.
Someone in the camp began reading a Tweet out loud, warning that cops fully dressed in raid gear were lining up a few streets down. But people seemed skeptical—within sight there were just a few officers wearing neon-yellow vests, and they didn’t look very threatening. They were the kind of cops you smiled at and said hello to.
Then the scene devolved into chaos.
Suddenly, blue and red lights interrupted the yellow hum of the lamp-posts overhead. EMT ambulances and loud voices over blow-horns put an end to the festivities, announcing the arrival of about 100 police officers who were about to storm into the camp.
As the police force moved inwards, they pushed and grabbed protestors by the neck, ripping tents down along the way. I couldn’t help but notice the stark contrast from earlier, when I had seen a police officer holding a pro-Occupy Boston sign and chatting with protesters politely. Now, handcuffed protesters were lined up outside police trucks, waiting to be taken in.
Truth be told, even in their riot gear, many of the cops were nervous. You could see it on their faces. Some of the protesters ran to the sidewalk to avoid getting arrested. Others held their ground, looking on defiantly. They were determined to stay the course.
By the end of the night I witnessed countless people get arrested, some more violently than others. Some too violently. One woman was held against the ground face-down and then dragged away, shouting unintelligibly. Another man was wrestled to the pavement, and then surrounded by officers trying to block cameras from snapping pictures.
“Shame! Shame! Shame!” shouted protesters from all corners of the camp. The chant was ubiquitous.
“WHO DO YOU SERVE? WHO DO YOU PROTECT?” yelled the crowd. “WE HAVE OUR PERMIT. IT’S CALLED THE CONSTITUTION,” they repeated over and over again. The arrests continued for a long time. The crowd chanted into the night.

CORRECTION APPENDED. See below.
"I share the conviction that inequality in America has been an increasingly serious problem for decades and that the time has come to do something about it. Inasmuch as that sense of injustice drives the protests breaking out around the US, I’m in sympathy with them. I’m glad to see what’s left of the labor movement joining in, since the decline of labor unions since the 1980s has clearly had a lot to do with the declining standard of living of many middle- and lower-income Americans.
It’s much too early for a historian to venture any predictions about whether this movement will grow or flame out.  It’s true that successful social movements start small. It’s also true that unsuccessful social movements start small. I hope this one generates enough support to keep growing in the coming months."
—James T. Kloppenberg
"Movements survive or fail based on how well-organized they are, in terms of structure, whether or not they have an organ to disseminate their ideas, and if they have people who are committed and see it as a vocation, who see it as a sacred vocation. The press isn’t really answering those questions, and it would really require someone to do some serious research. A good journalist should go and interview the leaders and find out the details and the institutional structure.
It’s both a positive and potentially negative thing, the fact that [the movement] appeared so quickly. It kind of makes you assume that it doesn’t have a well thought-out institutional organizational structural support, but there are examples where movements have been silently, behind the scenes, getting themselves established, and to the public it seems to come out of nowhere."

“I’m  not happy that you’re writing this article, you know,” Louis Menand says to me. He laughs briefly after he says this—to make me feel at ease, I think—but quickly reverts to his default poker face: a calm, largely expressionless look that would wear equally well at boardroom meetings or at desert casino poker tables. He explains that he doesn’t like to talk about himself and his private life in a public capacity. As a journalist himself, he knows that I’m seeking an angle. I know he isn’t going to make my job any easier, isn’t going to help the pieces come together.
Louis ‘Luke’ Menand (“Louis” pronounced “Loo-ee”, en français; “Menand” pronounced “Men-and”, en American; “Luke” — what Menand’s parents called him, and what stuck) is Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of English at Harvard. He has a C.V. that would make most humanities majors drool: staff writer for the New Yorker, long-time contributor to the New York Review of Books, and the recipient of the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for History for his book on American pragmatists, “The Metaphysical Club.” Menand is accomplished, but he prefers not to dwell on it.
He’s relatively soft-spoken and doesn’t dress loudly—slacks and collared button-down shirts without a tie seemed to be his preferred office wear. He doesn’t use unnecessarily large or obscure words in regular conversation. His voice is slightly on the nasal side, but it’s not distracting. When he walks, he keeps his back straight, but his good posture looks completely natural. A word to describe him might be “controlled.” I’ve heard him described as somewhat “Santa-like” when he keeps a beard, but without the beard, he looks like any ordinary, late-middle-aged white man.
Basically, what I’m trying to say is that Louis Menand seems like a perfectly nice, regular guy. But, he’s also very, very smart, and an excellent writer. Sometimes, people who are very, very smart and also excellent at communicating ideas can be controversial, or egotistical, or overwhelming personally, or underwhelming personally, but Menand is not really any of these. Speaking with him is interesting: on the one hand, he makes you feel comfortable by being a genial and pleasant conversationalist, but on the other hand, you can’t help but realize that he’s smarter than you, and that everything you say is being processed by somebody who’s spent a lot of time thinking about ideas, and words, and probably people, events, and cultural movements you haven’t heard of. Who is Louis Menand? To take a Menandian approach to this question, I propose an examination of the history.
LM: A BRIEF HISTORY
Louis Menand was born in Syracuse, New York in 1952, and grew up near Boston, in Bradford, Mass. He attended Brooks, a private preparatory school, where he contributed to the school’s literary magazine and was a coxswain on the school’s rowing team. Menand began writing poetry in high school and continued to write at Pomona College, where he studied English with an emphasis in creative writing and poetry. He wrote poems that appeared in the student newspaper and was  involved with the literary magazine. He also played piano in a rock band called “Pomona Today”—taking the name of the school’s alumni magazine.
After graduating from Pomona in 1973, he attended Harvard Law School for a year before taking a leave of absence. Menand recalls several reasons for his leave:
“One, Harvard Law School was much bigger than Pomona, and the classes were much bigger. Two, I didn’t think I was intellectually prepared: I felt I was lacking a background in social thought.”
While on leave, he began studying English in the Ph.D program at Columbia University, and liked it so much that he never went back to HLS. He was encouraged to attend by Richard Fader, a teacher of his at Pomona and a Columbia alumnus. In retrospect, Menand could not have found a better place to cultivate his interest in literary and cultural history.
“Columbia’s very literary-historical, and also very ‘history of ideas.’ So, they teach literature as part of ‘history of ideas’ and they teach ‘history of ideas’ as part of literary history. That appealed to me a lot, and that’s kind of what I do,” says Menand.
Menand earned his doctorate in 1980 and began his career as a writer, contributing regularly to publications like The New Republic and The New York Times Literary Supplement shortly thereafter. He’s best known today, however, for his writing that appears in The New Yorker. He got the job, curiously enough, while writing a story about the famous publication for another magazine.
“The New Yorker had a very famous editor named William Shawn for 35 years, and he had been replaced in 1986 or 1987 by Bob Gottlieb. Anyway, Bob Gottlieb read it and liked it, and had me come in to discuss writing for him,” says Menand.
As it turns out, Menand ended up turning down the first story he was pitched and didn’t write his first New Yorker piece until he got a pitch he liked a year later, but the rest is history.
IN THE CLASSROOM
“Look, when I hear him talk, I think—‘I ought to be more like that!’” says Professor Stephen Greenblatt, with whom Menand co-teaches English 110 (formerly known as Humanities 10). The course is known as a “Great Books” class, with a heavy-hitting syllabus that is known to include Homer’s “The Odyssey” and James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” with Dante and others in between.
Menand garners consistently high scores on the CUE (i.e., > 4.0) for the undergraduate courses he teaches, which in recent years have included English 110/Humanities 10, US in the World 23: Art and Thought in the Cold War (which boasted an enrollment of 330 students last spring), and English 158: The Novel in Europe, which he co-taught with English Professor Leah Price. Both his colleagues, like Greenblatt, and his students find Menand to be an exceptionally capable teacher.
“He looks very casual when he lectures, but there’s actually a very Aristotelian order to his lecturing. He’s also an incredibly skilled Socratic teacher. He asks questions to lead the discussion, and before you know it, a pattern you didn’t notice before suddenly emerges,” says Greenblatt.
Spencer Lenfield ’12, who took Humanities 10 and English 158 with Menand during his freshman year, says, “He has phenomenal teaching instincts, and knows how to address the concerns of the class at hand.“
Originally though, Menand never envisioned himself as becoming a particularly great teacher—he didn’t think he was cut out for the job.
“I didn’t like the idea of being an authority figure—it was sort of a 60s thing. I just felt it wasn’t me to have a role where I had some power over other people, but then I found that I really enjoyed it,” says Menand, chuckling a bit at the end.
In his late 20s, Menand began teaching a writing class as a preceptor at Princeton University, and to his surprise, found that he really enjoyed teaching because it forced him to question and reflect in ways he wouldn’t have otherwise.
“They [students] make you think of questions you haven’t thought of. In order to get them interested, you get started thinking of ways of framing the subjects, or questions to ask,” says Menand.
In a way, writing for magazines and teaching have been mutually reinforcing, Menand observes. “One of the things that is pretty constant is that you’re trying to explain subjects to readers, and it’s a little bit like teaching. And that’s fun,” says Menand.
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD
If you search “Louis Menand” on Google, the first result is www.louismenand.org, a website that would appear to be Menand’s official home page (the second result listed is his Wikipedia page, and the third is his New Yorker author profile). As it turns out, Menand had little to do with the website, which notes, “The Essential Menand is a site maintained by devoted fans of Louis Menand.” Ergo, somebody must have really liked Menand, and that somebody turns out to be Peter Kang.
Kang is a Columbia alumnus from the Class of 2005, who has since started up a web design development company that has redesigned web pages for various Harvard organizations, including parts of the Cabot House website. As it turns out, “The Essential Menand” might never have come about, had it not been for a single serendipitous moment in the winter of 2004-5.
Kang, then a junior at Columbia University double-majoring in history and film studies, happened to see a copy of Menand’s collection of essays, “American Studies,” in the window display of the no longer existent Barnes and Noble in Astor Place on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.
“I thought, ‘Oh, I’m studying American history; I might want to check out this book’,” recalls Kang, who quickly took a liking to Menand’s writing.
After finishing “American Studies,” Kang went on to read “The Metaphysical Club” and recommended the books to his friends. Then, in the summer of 2005, Kang decided to make a website that would catalog Menand’s writings for other Menand enthusiasts—hence, “The Essential Menand,” which provides links to most of Menand’s work available online prior to 2007.
“The Metaphysical Club” would be influential for Kang in writing his thesis on the impact of philanthropic organizations in the Deep South during the Robber Baron era; Kang referred to Menand as a model of historical prose: clear, concise, and highly engaging.
“I looked up to him as a writer—that’s primarily why I made the website,” says Kang.
For Menand, the fan-supported creation of a website bearing his name was rather unexpected.
“I was shocked. I didn’t know about it for a long time, but then I met the kids who did it, and they were great. I think it’s a great website,” says Menand, giving his official Menandian stamp of approval.
THE MENANDIAN AESTHETIC
Few professors at Harvard have websites made for them by dedicated fans—actually, few professors have dedicated “fans” in the first place, but it’s important to note that few professors write as distinctively and memorably as Menand does for both academic and general audiences.
“His prose is beautifully carpentered, luminous. He has a knack for turning over stones and uncovering writhing life beneath them,” says Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker. Finder has worked with Menand since the mid-1990s, and notes the coolness of Menand’s approach, which sets him apart from other modern-day critics.
“In an era of car-alarm criticism, his use of understatement is distinctive,” says Finder.
Menand himself has always favored writers who display a certain sense of emotional removal from their subject matter, citing Joan Didion and Janet Malcolm as two writers who excel at this approach.
“I’ve always liked very cold writing. I always get attracted to people who can really get very distant emotionally from their subjects. Just to really look at something with a very, very cold eye—it warms my heart when people do that,” remarks Menand with a fleeting, ironic smile.
Although one might think that consciously removing emotions and personal experience from a piece might be troublesome, for Menand, a distanced, objective approach to writing magazine articles is actually more comfortable.
“It’s easier, really. You always have to filter out a lot of personal static when you’re trying to write about an object,” says Menand.
Menand describes the process of writing his first book, “Discovering Modernism: T.S. Eliot and His Context,” as being a “painful” one because he had not yet found a method of writing that suited him. It was through magazine writing that he gradually let go of his old approach—taking detailed notes in relevant texts, outlining ideas, drafting and revising—and switched to a “once-through” approach.
“I don’t write drafts. I just write straight through,” says Menand. “When you write a draft of something and you know it’s not the final version, you tend to loosen up the logical connections between your sentences and your paragraphs. When you write sentence by sentence, and the sentence feels like a finished sentence, the seams between the sentences are much tighter, and that’s how you want the piece to read. Good writing is seamless writing.”
But, Menand still takes notes—just fewer of them overall, and more strictly textual.
“I take notes on the facts, and the quotes I’m going to use, but I never write down ideas, because I don’t have an idea really until I’m ready. By the time I’m writing, those ideas are going to already be passé,” says Menand.
Menand also has some practical tips for writing.
“You should never write when you’re tired, by the way. That’s really bad. You should write when you’re awake,” says Menand. I think of an all-nighter English essay written earlier during the week and feel a bit ashamed.
Menand pauses a moment, and then stares at me as if to make sure I’m paying close attention. “This is a fact I read in The New York Times—this will be the most interesting thing in your piece,” he says, adopting a pointed, professorial gaze and tone of voice: “Most world records are broken between the hours of 5 and 8 p.m. ... That’s right.” He smiled smugly, relishing a rare self-conscious moment of intellectual peacocking. I wasn’t sure if he was joking, but I believed him anyway.
“I find I am in my absolute best between 4 and 6 p.m., but that’s annoying because that’s when I usually want to go home and everybody else is going out,” Menand adds.
THE GREAT COMPROMISER
Not everybody on campus reads Menand’s articles in The New Yorker or takes his classes, but the campus as a whole is taking General Education courses instead of Core curriculum classes partially as a result of Menand’s involvement with the general education reform at Harvard several years ago. Alongside Professor Alison Simmons, Menand was appointed co-chair of the Task Force on General Education, a six-person committee (not including Menand and Simmons) that met in the summer of 2006 to discuss and revise a proposal written by an earlier Gen Ed Reform committee for a new general education curriculum at Harvard. Co-chair Alison Simmons remembers the atmosphere as “tense and exciting.”
“It was a difficult time in the University, what with Larry Summers’s resignation, having an interim President and Dean,” says Simmons. “We thought we would be doing the intellectual work, like writing the proposals, and then the Dean would sell the proposals to the Faculty. But, because we had an interim President and Dean, the responsibility was ours.”
In 2005, a previous committee had proposed a plan that, according to The Crimson, was “widely criticized for lacking a guiding vision and has generated little enthusiasm among the Faculty thus far.” Menand and Simmons had both been on that previous committee; they were chosen to lead the newest effort at reform because they had seen, and might know how to avoid, the problems that had doomed the last attempt.
“What Luke brought to the table was a strong sense of the history of general education at Harvard and elsewhere,” says Simmons. “He made the great point that every school has its own DNA, and that general education rises in historical periods for contingent reasons. We couldn’t recreate the Columbia ‘Great Books’ curriculum or the Brown ‘open curriculum’ for that reason.”
Simmons recalls a particular moment that would continue to guide the new committee. Menand, in an early planning session, “started to say ‘I have a dream,’ but then he realized what he was accidentally referencing and kind of went along with it and put up his fist. He told us that his dream was that any subject could be taught in General Education,” says Simmons.
For Menand, General Education should be about teaching topics and content to students, rather than teaching a discipline or methodology of any particular field. Of course, Menand realizes the practical limitations of his approach; some coursework is too advanced for students with no prior background.
“I’d say he’s a principled pragmatist, an idealist with principles,” says Simmons.
The committee eventually succeeded in finishing a proposal that won the approval of the Faculty, but there have been some who feel that the Gen Ed curriculum does not significantly improve Harvard’s course offerings.
Last spring, The Crimson reported that the new Gen Ed program, which was launched during the fall of 2009, will “undergo a review to determine how successful it has been in meeting the goals of Gen Ed” after its fifth year. Concerns about the success and accessibility of Gen Ed science courses have also surfaced.
The program also received criticism from commentators on higher education policy. “It seemed to me that after all the thought and talk, the changes were relatively modest,” says Stanley N. Katz ’55, President Emeritus of the American Council of Learned Studies. Katz writes on higher education policy for The Chronicle of Higher Education, and has known Menand since the early 1990s, when they crossed paths at the ACLS in New York.
Menand’s newest book, “The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University,” explores several topics of contention concerning higher education in America, including general education reform and growing interest in interdisciplinarity. Katz believes that Menand will not be remembered, however, for his ideas on higher education down the road, noting how few education reformers (aside from John Dewey) are remembered in the first place.
“He hasn’t written anything on education that’s been monumental, but I don’t think it would trouble him to hear me say that,” says Katz. “He’s writing to address current problems, which will of course be different in 50 years.”
In the meantime, though, Menand feels that the committee was generally successful in making modest improvements for Harvard’s general education curriculum.
“In the end, I think we came up with a program people are comfortable with, and it’s had a very good launch. In 10 years, we’ll have to do it over again, but that’s just the nature of these things. But that was pretty fun.”
EPILOGUE
This January, Louis Menand turns 60. He doesn’t seem too concerned.
“I’ve already turned old,” he quips facetiously. He notes that he still “feels young as a person” but has been noticing the physical effects of aging. Menand plans to keep writing as long as he enjoys it, and is currently working on a book about America during the Cold War era that’s been a continual project of his for the past decade.
Menand’s many publications have cemented his image as a cultural historian and literary critic, but he’s also been described as a “public intellectual”—a term with broader implications—in publications such as The Nation. “I think you could describe him as a public intellectual, but he would have problems with that,” says Finder, who knows Menand’s on-the-page public persona better than almost anyone.
I asked Menand what he thought. “No, I don’t have an agenda. I’m not trying to persuade the world of policy views. I’m a writer,” he replies. Perhaps Menand hesitates to call himself a public intellectual because the term also connotes a sense of distinct social importance, which elevates one socially and intellectually above the average person.
“He has a profound sense of humility,” says Lenfield. “He doesn’t have the ego that some other professors of his stature have.”
Simmons, who spent a great deal of time with Menand as co-chair of the TFGE, suggests Menand’s characteristic aversion to talking about himself is simply a product of his low-key personality. She remembers the first time they met.
“When I was paired with him [as committee co-chair], I rolled my eyes and thought, ‘Oh, New Yorker writer,’” she recalls with a hearty laugh.
Menand declined to talk much about his personal life, which seems perfectly reasonable coming from a man whose intellectual presence has been so remarkably visible and widely known (especially for an English professor and cultural historian). He seems like a perfectly regular guy: he likes to eat dinner at 7 p.m., follows sports (“Boston teams,” he tells me—he’s a local resident), sometimes goes to the movies, and even does Pilates (he prefers strength training to cardio, though).
“He’s an ordinary guy, for whom being seen as ordinary is important. He hates pretentious parties,” remarks Simmons. She may have attended a party or two with Menand.
For all the time and effort Menand invests towards interpreting the past, he’s keeping his eyes attentively directed at the present. With nothing to prove, Menand seems poised to carry on for as long as he wishes. Where does he see himself in 15 years?
“Fifteen years? I’ll be on the beach in Miami,” he jokes.

It’s been a few weeks since our last encounter and I know you’ve missed the gentle caress of this up-and-coming photo column. Lucky for you, I missed it too. To satisfy those irrepressible visceral cravings, I’m giving the people what they want—some more heavy petting in all the right places.

Starbucks: $2.25 | 2.5 Stars
The Chocolate:  We had high expectations for the source of all caffeinated fantasies. Alas, they were not met. Although the drink was not overly sweet, it was watery and lukewarm. Next time, stick to a Grande Non-fat Non-foam Half Caf Triple Mocha Latte Macchiato. Overall, disappointing showing from the beverage behemoth.
Burdick's: $3.50 | 4 Stars
The Chocolate: Ridiculously good—flavorful without being overly sweet. As if you left a Hershey’s bar in the sun, and it dripped into a small Burdick’s cup.  Highly recommend getting the demi because an overdose of this stuff could be fatal.  The price is the only downfall—it was the smallest amount of hot chocolate for the most money. Also, for those with sensitive palettes, it may be overwhelmingly rich.
Crema Cafe: $2.35 | 2 Stars
The Chocolate: Comes with decorative foam on top, a sure sign of class. But the drink was more aesthetically pleasing than it was delicious. It was watery, hardly sweet, and barely tasted like chocolate. Overall, not something to drink when your extremities are frostbitten, however charming the café may be.
Dunkin' Donuts: $1.79 | 5 Stars
The Chocolate: Besides Burdick’s, their chocolate was the richest, most flavorful, and the cheapest. It wasn’t too sweet and was perfectly hot. While you may want to take your cup to go, you certainly get a lot for a little.
Lamont Cafe: $2.45 | 3 Stars
The Chocolate: When in Lamont, it’s likely you’re either a) panicking to get an essay done in 12 hours or b) complaining that you have a lot of work but actively choosing to sit in the café where you know you’ll get none of it done. If either of those are the case, their hot chocolate will hit the spot and may even be worth killing your Board Plus. It is rather expensive for hot chocolate from a package, especially since you can get it for free at the Women’s Center. Overall, very sweet and a little watery with the occasional powdery clump.

The South End of Boston has always struck me as too sterile—business suits, straight lines, concrete. It lacks the color of Chinatown, the characters of the North End. I prefer to feel out-of-place, surrounded by foreign words that hold no significance to me on signs made by people with whom I have no connection. It is the process of understanding purpose, place, direction in which I find meaning. I prefer to be forced to locate myself within a setting, to discern my relation to that which is around me.
Today, South Station is as before. Ties, briefcases, heels rush past on the escalator, perpetually preoccupied and behind. They pass. I stand to the right. Within seconds, the push spits us out. The paneled buildings have always had the most beautiful reflections.
Yet, looking ahead, Dewey Square has become unfamiliar—tarps and tents rise between the concrete, grounded under a steel-frame sky. Immediately, Occupy Boston has neither the look nor the feel of revolution.
“Mic check!”
Scattered voices reply.
“Occupy Boston, have you forgotten? Mic check!”
The response is strengthened by a few.
The scene is a dilapidated museum; I—and many others—pass through. It is a lunch break, a detour, a sideshow. Some pause to talk to those sitting on camping chairs, perched on overturned buckets. Many just take photos. Most, on their way to other things, other places, at least take the time to read the signs: stop the war, stop the hate, stop the greed, stop the inequality—stop, stop, stop—legalize marijuana. A man asks if I am a registered voter—do I have a minute to sign a patient’s-right-to-death-petition? One woman asks no one in particular—everyone, I suppose—why there can’t just be more love. The general consensus is a general discontent. (There are a million different reasons why people are here; that’s what I love about it. We’re not trying to specify it to one thing.)
A mother stops to bend down next to her daughter. She points to a sign.
“Do you see that? What’s that symbol? Do you remember?”
“Peace!” The emblem, in many colors, also plasters the young girl’s sweatshirt.
“So let’s read it together. It says, ‘Lesssss Greeeeeed, More Peeeeaaaace’!”
“I get it, mommy!”
“I know you do, honey. You get it better than a lot of people these days”—more to herself than to her daughter.
To their left stands a plot of wilted sunflowers. Their seeds have been picked, their season has passed. A nearby sign—solid, city-approved, not cardboard like the others—explains its purpose. (What is growing on here?)
Local teachers in bright-red shirts have initiated a “Grade-In.” They are not the problem—say the signs—a lack of funding is. They are not the problem—say the teachers—they are the scapegoats. (Why is it just us taking the blame? Well, it’s not just us. But why are we being treated this way?)
“This is my first day.”
“Why are you here? What do you hope this brings?”
“Well, I haven’t completely thought it out yet. I guess it’s just an alternate voice.”
Boston College students and faculty march by. One woman offers them organic salad on a paper napkin (“Stop the commercialization of food!”)  as they pass. A man—late 60s?—from another time—another revolution?—drops off peanut butter and jelly at the food station. At the medical tent (We are standing alongside, not with, the protestors), someone asks to borrow the scissors. “In the future,” he is told, “talk to logistics about this sort of thing.”
A map rests against the information center—there, they are happy to point you to a schedule of the day’s events. One tent, at the end of one row, has a man-powered generator; a short pedal on one of the three sitting bikes can recharge a phone. How you can help the food tent now: wash dishes! The first women’s caucus will be held at 1 p.m. The physical organization, at the very least, is efficient.
But what is the catalyst for this community?
“For the love, for all the people. For the love of all the people.”
“Because only 15 percent of my graduating class last year got jobs.”
“Too many people I love have died in Iraq.”
“I’m just so sick of the system. I’m fed up, really.”
The protest does not lend itself to a focused narrative. The imagery is there, there are plenty of symbols for use—sunflowers, cement, microphones—yet there are too many fights, too many signs, too many exclamation points and bolded letters to convey a message that is succinct. (There is momentum, it’s just momentum in no particular direction.) Energy is not absent, though direction appears to be. It seems that the 99 percent has located itself within society, that many are discontent with their relation to the allocation of wealth—but, without clearly defined objectives, what is to be accomplished?
Admittedly, however, three hours is not enough time to comprehend. Perhaps, for the protest, the voices—for now—are all that need comprehending; action as secondary to at least being heard.
Perhaps, it may seem, the Occupy movement is also in the process of understanding.

Origin: ½ Latin: locu-, loc-. Other ½ unknown. Bles is potentially Old English. Maybe Norse. Or Latin (again).
Meaning: To speak with a lisp or stammer. Not blesiloquent yourself? Just watch your tongue.
Try saying it out loud a few times. Blesiloquent. It’s such a classy word, for a lisp, that is. I like its ring—soft and smooth—a little like melted chocolate. I always pause before I pronounce it, and I run through its consonants in my head. Sometimes, if I say it right, it sounds like “bliss.” It doesn’t sound too bad to be blesiloquent, unless you are blesiloquent yourself. Then saying the word is a nightmare.
And, for me, it sometimes is.
The truth is I never actually had a speech impediment. I was the lucky one in my family. My sister was the one that had to go to classes every Wednesday for three years and learn how to say her T’s and S’s and Z’s. For the letter W, the therapist told her that she had to close her mouth into a tight circle—as if she were drinking from a teeny-tiny straw—and quickly make a “Wah” sound. I used to look at the colorful handouts she brought home, left on the kitchen counter. There were pictures of lips with little arrows indicating how your mouth should move when you pronounce certain letters. I would stare at them for hours, trying to figure out how letters were supposed to be said. Yet I personally never understood the physics of speech therapy.
It began this past February. When I first noticed myself lightly hissing at my words, I was in the midst of that early semester hell week, and had just finished a midterm and handed in a problem set, so when I spoke and noticed the tiny buzz on my S’s, I figured I was tired and had forgotten how to speak. But after a week of solid rest, words with S’s were still hissing as they slipped out of my mouth. I didn’t know what was wrong with me, so I told myself to stop. But it sounded more like this:
Sssssssstop.
So I got angry and bit my tongue. Now this was bothering me. Lisps didn’t just develop out of nowhere. Maybe it was something I had bypassed as a kid, and it had finally come out to say hello, or rather haunt me now. Kind of like chicken pox and shingles. I wondered if Groundhog Day had anything to do with it. Six more weeks of winter. Did that mean six weeks of lisp?
It wasn’t until I was sitting in my Spanish tutorial, learning about Bourdieu’s signifiers and signified en Español (as if it wasn’t difficult enough in English), that I developed hypothesis #2. I realized that my wonderful hissing could potentially be due to my professor. The man was from Spain, and therefore spoke in the true Spanish manner—with a lisp. Was this the culprit? After just one month in his class, I had developed a speaking style native to Spain. That was great. I was ecstatic. Until I realized that the lisp only manifested itself in English. I kept trying to hiss as I spoke in class “Sssí sseñor,” “ssupongo que,” “asssí.” He just gave me a sstrange look every time.
A friend told me that if you kick yourself, you can lose your lisp. So I walked around kicking myself for the next few days. I wasn’t convinced that Spanish was why I had a lisp. It seemed too sudden.
A little later, I had to admit the true reason. My lisp, in fact, developed (and I now admit this with a tinge of embarrassment) consciously. Last January, on a service trip in Nicaragua, I befriended another American girl who happened to have a lisp. She didn’t buzz or hiss her words too strongly. Rather, it just gave her a girly air as she spoke. And honestly, it seemed fun. So in my attempt to mimic her cuteness, I began sticking my tongue between my teeth as I spoke. Ssssss, ssssss, ssssuddenly, I was hissing too. And months later, I ssstill am.
My mother would yell if she ever heard this story. There was a reason she took my sister to a speech therapist for years. But it’s startling how quickly I picked up the habit. I’ve debated going to that speech therapist and putting a Cheerio on my tongue as I try to learn how to pronounce words again, but I’m too lazy for that, so now I’m kind of stuck with it.
It’s scary how contagious this blesiloquence was. I never realized that speech styles can change so suddenly. So my remedy, and potentially spiteful retaliation, has been to pass it on through this test on contagion. Are you lisping now too? Did your brain hiccup at the sight of that s?
Yessss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences begins to recover from the recent economic downturn, faculty searches in a number of Social Sciences departments are increasing, allowing the departments to hire junior faculty and fill positions vacated by retiring faculty members.
While several department chairs continued to emphasize that the school is suffering financial woes, these administrators said they view the upward trend in searches as an opportunity to restore pre-crisis faculty sizes.
“We’re still in straitened circumstances—it’s not a boom,” said Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell. “But our department lost a number of junior faculty members last year ... and, fortunately, FAS has said we can replenish it.”
After FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced a freeze on the majority of searches in 2008—and the school offered a retirement package for tenured professors in FAS the following year—faculty growth stagnated.
This September, Smith announced that the FAS budget deficit had been reduced from $35 million to $16 million over the 2011 fiscal year, meaning that more resources could be devoted towards searches.
With 43 searches authorized across FAS this year—a sizable increase from the 34 conducted in 2010 and 24 conducted in 2009—Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser said the current level of searches was sufficient “to maintain the strength of each division.”
The History department was one of the hardest-hit by faculty attrition. The number of tenured and tenure-track History professors has decreased from 57 in 2006 to 47 in 2010.
Today, the department is in the process of conducting five faculty searches, including two searches for Latin American historians, one for a modern Chinese historian, a joint search with History and Literature for a historian of ethnicity and immigration to the United States, and a joint search with the Department of African and African-American studies.
Retirement and faculty attrition have also taken their toll on the Anthropology department, according to Chair Theodore C. Bestor.
“The size of the faculty of anthropology has not grown very much over the past decade, and in fact, we’ve had a number of people who retired or left for other jobs and were not replaced,” Bestor said.
As FAS fast-tracked the promotion of junior faculty members in the past several years in order to maintain the number of tenured professors, many departments—including Economics, History, and Social Studies—saw a decline in the number of assistant and associate professors.
According to Campbell, while the Economics department would sometimes directly search for senior faculty members in pre-crisis years, there has been a renewed focus recently on recruiting younger academics.
“We don’t want a faculty that’s too top-heavy,” Campbell said. “We always want young, talented, new people coming in—fresh blood.”

Harvard Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer has been named the recipient of the 2012 Calvo-Armengol International Prize in recognition of his research on racial interaction and education policy.
It is the second prestigious award given to Fryer in recent weeks, as he received a MacArthur “Genius” Grant in late September.
The Calvo-Armengol Prize is awarded every other year by the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics to a “top researcher in economics or social sciences younger than 40 years old for his or her contribution to the theory and comprehension of the mechanisms of social interaction,” according to the official prize website.
Fryer is the second-ever recipient of the award, following MIT Economics Professor Esther Duflo, who was awarded the prize for her research in development economics.
Fryer has written extensively on segregation, the achievement gap, and teenage behavior.
One topic of interest for his research has been the plight of mixed raced children.
In an interview, Fryer noted that while some of these children displayed “particularly bad” behavior in school, “The types of behavior they engaged in really depended on the networks of friends that they had.”
“Interestingly, later in life, they totally rebounded and had higher incomes,” Fryer added.
In general, Fryer said he studies social interactions as a key factor in determining individual outcomes.
“What’s important to me is that everyone, every single person, has an opportunity to be a productive part of the economy,” Fryer said. “It frustrates me that there are children, just by circumstance of their birth, that will not have the same opportunity in the economy that other folks do.”
Fryer himself defied the odds, overcoming an impoverished upbringing in order to become a renowned economist.
Although he has done extensive research in education and racial social interactions—and is currently evaluating a project implemented by the Houston public schools to turn around schools for the better—Fryer said he has not yet achieved all of his goals.
“I don’t think I am successful, with all due respect of the prize committee,” Fryer said. “My goal has always been to fundamentally change the odds for children who were born in poor ZIP codes. I haven’t done that yet. And that’s what motivates me.”

Harvard School of Public Health researchers recently found evidence that links nutrition with semen quality, observing that diets rich in processed grains and red meat impaired sperm motility when compared to healthier diets that included fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Male subjects between the ages of 18 and 22 were classified into two different dietary groups based on their responses to a food frequency questionnaire. The first was identified as a Western diet, which was characterized by high intakes of red meat and refined grains, while the other dietary pattern was identified as a Prudent diet, which included high intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fish.
Researchers looked at three specific sperm quality parameters: sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm morphology.
“We saw that the Western pattern diet really had no association with any of the semen quality parameters in our study,” said Audrey J. Gaskins, lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate at the Harvard School of Public Health.
While diet seemed to have no impact on either sperm concentration or morphology, men who consumed the healthier Prudent diet were found to have sperm with significantly greater motility, or ability to move towards the egg.
Gaskins said a possible explanation for this link may lie with the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables.
“The more natural antioxidant intake you have, the better balance you’ll have between the antioxidants and reactive oxygen species, which decrease sperm quality,” she said.
Gaskins added she hopes to eventually show that, with healthier diets, increases in sperm motility will translate into increased fertility. She is now looking to see if the same association can be made between diet and semen quality for an older male population.
The study’s results were presented on Monday at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine annual meeting in Florida. Gaskins also worked with researchers from the University of Rochester, the University of Murcia in Spain, and the University of Copenhagen in Netherlands.
“We are still exploring the impact of nutrition on male fertility, but even these initial studies point to a link between a good diet and reproductive health for men,” said Edward Kim, President of the Society for Male Reproduction and Urology, in a press release.

Joel Brenner, Former National Security Agency inspector general and senior counsel, warned against the increasing vulnerability of American cyber society last night at the Cambridge First Parish Church.
Brenner’s remarks were based on  his new book, “America the Vulnerable,” which discusses the dangers that the lack of technological privacy may pose to governments, corporations, and individual citizens.
People make themselves vulnerable everyday, he said, citing discount grocery cards, credit cards, EZ-Pass, and particularly file sharing programs as technologies that “leave footprints” of a person’s activity.
A lack of security consciousness can have grave consequences, he said. For example, the flight plan of the presidential helicopter was once leaked to Tehran after a Defense Department employee used a file-sharing program on a government computer, according to Brenner.
Brenner, who graduated from Harvard Law School, said he wrote the book after his work in the government led him to realize how little the American public understands about the security risks of sharing information through technology.
“[We are] electronically naked without even knowing it,” he said. “[But] we love this connectivity. We embraced this world.”
Brenner emphasized that the increasing digitization of information could lead to new and dangerous forms of espionage.
“Joshua sent spies into the Holy Land. This is not new,” he said, referencing the biblical story in the book of Numbers. “[But] now you don’t need a spy, you can steal information remotely.”
Brenner outlined the increasing capabilities of modern cyber-theft and espionage, stressing the possible international consequences.
“When someone steals your car and you go outside, you know it’s gone,” he said, “When someone steals a trade secret, you still got it.”
It could take years, Brenner said, to realize that another country or company has stolen information.
“We’ve both embraced it and it makes us uncomfortable,” he said of cyber insecurity.
“How does one begin to come to grips with technology that is wonderful and also taking off our clothes to a certain extent?”
Brenner compared the risks of transferring technological information to the exchange of sexually transmitted diseases.
“Take a USB,” he said, “you don’t know where it’s been and you stick it in your USB drive, where was that last night?”
Brenner said that the underlying problem is the average user’s willingness to share potentially sensitive information.
“When security butts heads with convenience, which it does all the time, convenience wins,” Brenner said.

Animals as gifts aren’t new to Currier House Masters Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross, but though they appreciate the sentiment, they don’t quite know what to do with them.
Over the years, Wrangham and Ross have received many animals at ceremonies in Uganda, including a bull three years ago. Ross helped facilitate the installation of electricity at an elementary school in southwest Uganda, and at a ceremony celebrating the advancement last June, she received a gift: a live chicken.
The electricity is just one initiative of the Kasiisi Project, an organization founded by Ross that is devoted to improving education and ecological conservation efforts in Kibale National Park, located in rural western Uganda.
Ross created the project in 1997 in an effort to encourage local Ugandans to preserve the Kibale Forest, where Wrangham has conducted research on chimpanzees for over 25 years.
During the House Masters’ sabbatical last year, when they were based in Cambridge, England, they spent significant time in Uganda, Tanzania, and other countries in order to pursue their research and conservation efforts abroad.
During that year, while her husband wrote about eight research articles, Ross initiated the transformation of the Kasiisi Project from a non-governmental organization largely managed by Ross into a community-based organization run by local Ugandans.
MONKEYING AROUND
In January and February, instead of overseeing Currier House as the Quad was blanketed in snow, Wrangham and Ross lived in the Makerere University Biological Field Station in Uganda. The site is one of the oldest chimpanzee research stations in the world, according to Human Evolutionary Biology Lecturer Zarin P. Machanda, and Wrangham has conducted research there for over 25 years.
Researchers, including Wrangham, have been able to observe many chimpanzees for their entire life, and local Ugandan field assistants observe the chimps on a daily basis.
The research collected over the years contributed to some of the articles Wrangham wrote with graduate students while on sabbatical.
One of these articles concerns juvenile chimpanzees and demonstrates that while males will use short sticks as a weapon, females carry them around—just like young human girls play with dolls. According to Wrangham, this is the first example of a non-human using something as a doll.
This example of “imaginary play,” as Ross referred to it, requires that data be collected over a long time horizon, meaning the forest must remain intact so the chimpanzees can thrive.
LIFE IN AFRICA
While they were not involved in Currier House life, the Masters acted on their deep ties to communities in Africa.
Wrangham’s need for Ugandan locals to conserve the forest provided the impetus for Ross’ founding of the Kasiisi Project, which began only at a single school but is now at 14 schools serving some 9,980 students.
“We do everything you can imagine to help primary schools,” Ross said.
According to Michelle A. Sirois ’12, who worked with the Kasiisi Project this summer, the project has taught students about conservation and has also improved literacy and initiated health and sanitary programs at local schools.
“That day was a testament to how much she means to the community and how much she can give to the community,” Sirois said of the ceremony where Ross received a chicken.
Caroline D. J. Riss, the interim field director for the Kasiisi Project, echoed Sirois’ statement about Wrangham and Ross’ presence in Uganda. Since they have been going to Uganda for over 20 years, sometimes with their three sons, they have an “unbelievable presence around Kibale National Park,” Riss wrote in an email. “Dr. Ross and Professor Wrangham cannot go anywhere without being stopped by villagers, researchers, friends and acquaintances for greetings and thanks.”
Emily Otali, the project manager of the Kibale Chimpanzee Project who named her daughter after Ross, was a former Ph.D. student of  Wrangham’s and is now chair of the Scholarship Committee for the Kasiisi Project.
According to Otali, “Richard is the more quiet person and leaves Elizabeth to deal with everything,” but the local Ugandans say that Wrangham is the most “honest white person ever.”
Machanda said that Wrangham and Ross are very relaxed when they are in Uganda.
“He kind of lets it go a little bit. We’ll just have beers on the front porch and we can watch the animals go by,” Machanda said. “You can see their stress levels decrease,” especially Wrangham’s.
Although Ross is very busy managing the Kasiisi Project while she is in Uganda—“going to schools, meeting with parents and scholars, checking out the accounts, supervising and appraising all the project’s activities,” Otali wrote—she makes time to cook, and do “girly things,” like getting pedicures and dinner with Otali.
Locals come to Ross to ask for help, usually asking for money, and though Ross cannot give money to everyone, she does her best to help when possible, Otali wrote.
For Wrangham, “the single most exciting experience was living with the hunter-gatherers for 10 days.”
In Tanzania, Wrangham lived with a group of hunter-gatherers called the Hadza and worked on filming a documentary, as they are the last hunter-gatherers whose way of life has remained intact over the years.
WELCOME HOME
Although Wrangham said it is always hard coming back from sabbatical, where he got to set his own agenda, “it is wonderful being back in every way.”
Wrangham and Ross said that the first two years as House masters were a steep learning curve, but coming back now was familiar.
To prepare for their sabbatical, Wrangham and Ross met with several possible interim replacements, ultimately selecting James L. Cavallaro ’84, a Harvard Law School professor, and Nadejda Marques.
Before their departure, Wrangham and Ross introduced Cavallaro and Marques at open houses and a stein club.
While on sabbatical, Wrangham and Ross were not completely removed from House life. They maintained a blog for their Currier students and returned for commencement.
“We wanted to say goodbye to our seniors,” Wrangham said.
Those in the House said they were thrilled that Wrangham and Ross returned this year.
“I love having Richard and Elizabeth here,” Alex J. Breinin ’12 said. “I love hearing about their experiences in Africa and back home in Europe.”
Chris W. Danello ’12 agreed that it is nice to have Wrangham and Ross back in Currier, and said that the transition was aided by the fact that, “We have the best house administrator at Harvard.”
According to Danello, Currier House Administrator Patricia Gnazzo Pepper—who also visited Wrangham and Ross in England—provided a vital link between Wrangham and Ross and Marques and Cavallaro.
Danello, though, had another reason he was glad Wrangham and Ross were back from sabbatical.
“The other difference in having Richard and Elizabeth back is I hear a lot more about chimpanzees at dinner,” he said, “And, frankly, as a college student, that helps me understand my roommates a lot better.”

High levels of Fusobacterium cells have been discovered in the tumor tissues of several colorectal cancer patients, raising the possibility that these bacteria may be linked to the cancer, according to a recently released study headed by Harvard Medical School Graduate Student Aleksandar D. Kostic.
Scientists say they will need to conduct more research to determine the exact relationship between the bacterium and colon cancer, but the findings should make diagnosing patients easier and could have implications for the treatment of colon cancer.
The study, titled “Genomic Analysis Identifies Association of Fusobacterium with Colorectal Carcinoma,” located extraneous organisms in normal and infected tissues by examining their microbial make-up through a process called Pathogen Sequencing.
Taking initial samples from nine colorectal cancer patients, a team of 18 researchers was able to compare DNA sequences to determine which microorganisms were present in the cancerous tissue but not in the healthy tissue. A close analysis of the samples revealed that one genus of bacteria seemed to be present in the infected tissues.
“From the individual samples, we identified more than 300 distinct organisms,” said Kostic. “But there was one very striking exception, and that was the abundance of Fusobacteria in the tumor tissues.”
With this observation, researchers then proceeded to validate their findings with a broader participant pool of 95 patients. Again, the presence of Fusobacteria was found to be common across the samples that were collected.
Tremendous improvement in DNA sequencing technology throughout the past decade helped make the discovery possible, researchers said.
“We had been conducting research on colon cancer since 2001,” said Harvard Medical School Pathology Professor  Matthew L. Meyerson ’85, a researcher on the study. “DNA sequencing technology has helped us make leaps and bounds in attempting to determine the cause of colon cancer.”
Researchers point out, however, that this link between Fusobacteria and colon cancer does not necessarily determine causality.
“What this work shows is simply an association,” said Kostic. “What we’re still trying to establish is whether Fusobacteria is a cause or consequence of colon cancer.”
Kostic and his team have already begun further research on the topic, and are currently conducting experiments on mice.
Although conclusive findings could be a decade away, if the animals are found to develop colon cancer upon exposure to Fusobacteria, it could establish a causal relationship between the bacterium and colon cancer.
The results could play a major role in developing potential treatments for colon cancer.
“We don’t know yet whether there is a causal relationship between this bacteria and colon cancer,” said Kostic. “But if there is, then it might be possible to give patients Fusobacteria-targeting antibiotics to treat colon cancer.”

Harvard is currently undergoing a review of the sexual assault policies in place across the University’s different schools as part of a larger effort to monitor its compliance with federal discrimination guidelines.
According to Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman, the Office of the Assistant to the President has, since Spring 2010, been gathering information in a review of its policies’ compliance with the law regarding gender, race, and disability. This process has focused on information collection and program development, rather than policy revision, Coleman wrote in an email to The Crimson on Wednesday.
In addition, the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response recently formed a committee to review its procedures. OSAPR announced last week that it would postpone student participation on the committee, despite having previously appointed student members.
The review process was initiated as part of a larger investigation of University policies. But the re-examination of sexual assault practices became particularly timely following the April release of the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) new guidelines for university sexual misconduct policies, which fall under federal Title IX regulations.
The OCR’s "Dear Colleague" letter came in the wake of a slew of complaints filed against institutions including Yale University and Harvard Law School for creating "hostile sexual environments."
In the months following the letter, universities across the country, including both Yale and Princeton, have adjusted their procedures for dealing with sexual misconduct complaints and sexual assault investigations.
"There’s been a rush to come into compliance," said Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law and policy. "Everyone’s been in a scramble."
Lake added that the new federal guidelines have also experienced "pushback" from advocates of rights for accused students.
According to Lake, a few of the guidelines that the letter set out will be particularly important as Harvard considers its current policies. In particular, the letter has raised questions about the decentralized nature of Harvard’s investigatory system—in which each school determines their own procedure to deal with internal cases.
For example, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ procedures require that the Administrative Board be "sufficiently persuaded" by the evidence provided. On the other hand, the Law School currently uses the more stringent "burden of proof" standard, which requires "clear and convincing" evidence to find a defendant guilty. The new OCR guidelines, in contrast, require universities to follow the lower "preponderance of evidence" standard, which can find a defendant guilty with a simple majority of the evidence pointing to that verdict.
Over the past few months, universities have implemented a number of changes to their sexual assault policies, including an expanded definition of sexual assault, a lower standard of evidence to find a defendant guilty, and more training for students and university staff.
Lake said that one particularly popular move has been the contracting of independent companies offering sexual assault training sessions.
Yale implemented a new definition of sexual misconduct that encompasses speech and online communication, created a new university-wide committee to handle all complaints, and mandated that all student organizations participate in prevention training, the Yale Daily News reported earlier this month. Similarly, Princeton edited its sexual misconduct policies to include more explicit definitions of misconduct, assault, and rape, and mandated that all investigations conclude within a 45 day period, according to the Daily Princetonian.

The College’s academic integrity survey conducted last year received too few responses to provide productive data to help administrators address cheating on campus, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
He said that only about 27 percent of students participated in the survey and that most of those were freshmen.
"The response rate was very low," Harris said. "It’s hard to know what to do with it."
Instead of analyzing information gleaned from the survey, the Committee on Academic Integrity, which was convened last year, will focus its discussions on studying honor codes, according to Harris.
"Obviously if we had gotten a 70 percent response rate, we’d be having a different conversation," Harris said.
Megan R. Mitrovich, an alumna of the Graduate School of Education who was Harvard’s point person for the survey last year and now serves on the academic integrity committee, said that—in addition to honor codes—there will be a range of other avenues for promoting integrity on the committee’s agenda. These options might include more rigorous in-class discussions of proper citations and special sessions on integrity for freshmen.
"There is no single solution," she said, adding that the College should implement a variety of "different actions from the time students step onto campus."
The survey, which included different questions for students, teaching fellows, and faculty, was conducted by the Center for Academic Integrity at Clemson University. The Center has used the same module at many other universities.
Students were urged in four separate emails—one signed by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds—to fill out the online questionnaire. The emails assured students that the survey was completely anonymous and would take about 10 minutes to complete.
But the repeated requests did little to convince most upperclassmen.
Although the sample was too small and too skewed toward younger students to be useful to administrators, committee members said the attitudes revealed by the exercise were illuminating.
"The survey provided a window into campus culture and is a climate

As Harvard alumni gathered to celebrate the University’s 375th anniversary, members of the Student Labor Action Movement seized the moment to show their support for Harvard’s workers.
Group members hung signs from freshman dormitories and handed out fliers that championed workers’ rights.
Their campaign, titled "180:1," is meant to reflect what SLAM members see as a gross disparity between the wages of Harvard’s highest and lowest paid workers. SLAM says the 180:1 ratio reflects the gap between the University’s highest paid and its lowest paid workers.
"I think it’s really important that a University like Harvard that has the resources to provide a living wage for its workers does so" Gabriel H. Bayard ’15 said.
Harvard Management Company Managing Director Stephen Blyth—the University’s highest paid employee—earned $8.4 million in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available. Blyth, along with a team of highly paid executives, manages Harvard’s internal investments.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin defended the pay rates.
"The compensation system used by the University for its investment team is performance based, rewarding investment managers only when they make money for the University," Galvin wrote in a statement. "In addition, the University’s internal investment team saves the University millions of dollars every year versus equivalent external management costs."
Members of SLAM made banners to display during the Harvard’s 375th celebration and Freshman Parents’ Weekend. Several banners and flyers were emblazoned with the phrase "workers can’t eat prestige."
But security guards warned students to take the banners down from freshman dorms on Monday, citing a policy against hanging anything from dorm windows.
The 180:1 campaign has a number of demands, including more full-time jobs and the end of "split shifts" for Harvard employees, according to SLAM’s official website. When workers are assigned split shifts, they are asked to work in the morning and then return to work later the same day for a night shift. Other demands include better access to childcare and greater disability benefits.
"I want personal days. They used to have them, but not anymore, not at all. After 10 years, we get only one month of vacation days. I wanted to stay home on my birthday but no, I had to come in to work," said Anie Lefleur, who has worked as a Harvard custodian for 12 years.
However, other Harvard employees said they are happy with the working conditions at Harvard.
"I’m satisfied with the benefits we have right now. I don’t want anybody to get laid off. I don’t want anything changed," said Wallace J. Henry, a custodian in the Yard for over 22 years. "We have health insurance, disability insurance, retirement plan. I’m satisfied."
Average hourly wages for Harvard custodial workers have increased by about 36 percent from 2005 to 2011, Galvin wrote in a written statement.

Tech giant Google invested approximately $28 million last month in the new Charlesview Apartment Complex, which will offer 240 low-income housing units near the Brighton Mills Shopping Center.
Harvard has already agreed to provide $72 million for the new structure, which will replace the old Charlesview complex—a concrete cluster of 213 low-income units located near Harvard Business School. The apartment complex was originally built in the 1970s.
According to University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp—who is heading the University’s development in Allston along with Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and other officials—the University was not involved in Google’s investment.
Google spokesperson Jim Prosser said that Google decided to invest in the Charlesview Apartment Complex because the project provided an opportunity to gain profit and expand its presence in the area.
Investments like Charlesview “actually are attractive deals to Google from a financial perspective,” he said. Prosser added that the company tries to invest “especially in places where we already have presence,” referring to the company’s office located at 5 Cambridge Center in Cambridge.
Google’s investment in Charlesview comes over a year after it made an $86 million investment in low-income and senior citizen housing units in seven communities in the Midwest and California in August 2010.
In 2009, Harvard gained possession of the old Charlesview Complex in a land swap with the Charlesview Board of Directors. The University consolidated its land holdings in Allston, and the deal paved the way for the construction of the new apartment complex, which began this past April.
In the long term, Community Builders Inc., the project’s nonprofit developer, intends to add a 100-unit condominium tower to the Brighton complex. About one fourth of the units in the tower will be targeted toward low- to moderate-income residents.
The developer also envisions constructing retail stores, a park, a community center, and an underground parking garage.
Prosser added that there have been no discussions about future collaboration between Google and Harvard. The University has yet to announce its plans for the old apartment complex.

At 4 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 15, “Kill Season” officially began.
The Harvard men’s basketball team enters the 2011-12 campaign facing high expectations. It’s not just expected to win the Ivy League championship. It’s not just expected to make the NCAA tournament.
It’s expected to dominate the Ivy League. It’s expected to make noise in March. As its junior class is fond of saying, it’s expected to kill.
I guess those are the sorts of expectations a team receives when it returns its entire lineup and adds the conference’s top recruiting class to a team that was one game away from dancing last March.
But for a team with such lofty expectations, the Crimson enters this season with a number of question marks. How will junior forward Kyle Casey respond after undergoing offseason surgery? How will the Crimson’s seven freshmen fit into the rotation? What can be expected of junior point guard Brandyn Curry now that he is fully healthy?
Last Saturday, we started to learn some of the answers. In front of a healthy crowd at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard kicked off its season with the unveiling of the team’s 2011 Ivy League championship banner and an intra-squad scrimmage.
Some questions were answered before tipoff.
Casey—who underwent foot surgery in the offseason to repair the broken right foot on which he played half his sophomore season—seemed to be back to his old ways.
Moments after emerging from the locker room, Casey threw down a ferocious 360-windmill, and then followed up with a “Honey Dip” slam, dunking and then hanging with his elbow in the rim. It doesn’t seem like the foot is bothering him too much.
And on a team best known for its dynamic frontcourt pairing of Casey and co-captain Keith Wright, junior point guard Brandyn Curry’s importance has sometimes been overlooked. But this year, that could change.
After struggling through knee problems his first two seasons, Curry enters the upcoming campaign fully healthy for the first time in his collegiate career. On Saturday, the difference was noticeable. Defenders were unable to stay in front of the lefty point guard, as he cruised to 13 points in the 20-minute scrimmage.
Curry also showed off his healthy knees during layup lines. After rarely dunking during his first two seasons, Curry consistently threw it down.
“I feel like physically I’m on a whole new level than I was last year,” said Curry, an All-Ivy Second Team selection last season who averaged 9.3 points and a league-best 5.9 assists per game. “I feel faster, stronger, and I’m in better shape. I’m not hurting every day.”
Curry will get plenty of time to rest his knees thanks to Tommy Amaker’s fourth recruiting class, considered to be among the nation’s best for a program outside a Power Six conference. Rookies Keynatta Smith and Wesley Saunders—rated 90 and 89 by ESPN, respectively—are thought to be the Crimson’s top freshmen. But how the pair will be used—and whether they see the floor—remains to be seen.
Smith (6’8”, 260 lbs) appears to be strikingly similar to a young Keith Wright (6’8”, 240 lbs). Both are most comfortable with their backs to the basket and score using an array of low-post moves rather than overwhelming opponents with athleticism. But with Wright—the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year—slated to eat a chunk of the minutes at center, there might not be many left over for Smith.
Saunders faces a similar dilemma. A 6’5” wing with tremendous athleticism (he was the only one close to keeping up with Casey’s dunks), Saunders will have to compete with co-captain Oliver McNally, junior Christian Webster, and sophomore Laurent Rivard for playing time on the wing.
Instead, it seems that two lesser-known rookies may make the biggest impact on the court this year. Forwards Jonah Travis (6’6”) and Steve Moundou-Missi (6’7”) showed on Saturday that they can help address one of the Crimson’s biggest needs—defense and rebounding. While neither may be exceptionally tall, it seems their athleticism and aggressiveness on the glass should be an immediate help to the Crimson.
But while many questions were addressed on Saturday afternoon, one remains unanswered. What will be the song of the 2011-12 Harvard basketball campaign? Two seasons ago, it was Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Rihanna’s “Run This Town.” Last year, it was Yeezy’s “All of the Lights.” This year? Well, according to Curry, that won’t be decided for a few more weeks until Wale and Drake’s new albums have dropped.
I guess we’ll just have to wait to find the answers to some questions.

For 11 years, Natalie Doyle was a setter. When she first picked up volleyball as a diminutive 10-year old, she quickly fell in love with the position, as her height limited where she could play on the court. Over a decade later, Doyle is back in the setting role due to an injury to starting junior setter Beth Kinsella, and enjoying every minute of it.
“I love getting to make the decisions,” Doyle said. “As a setter you have this unique opportunity to control the pace of the game.”
Coming into the year, Doyle played primarily as a right-side defensive player, but her plans for the season changed in a flash. Early in a late September match at Princeton, Kinsella went down with a hand injury, forcing Doyle into the spotlight. The sophomore didn’t miss a beat, recording a career-high 51 assists in a close loss to the Tigers.
“It just felt natural,” said Doyle of returning to her childhood position. “It wasn’t as much of an adjustment as I thought it would be. I had the skills, and my teammates helped me through it.”
While the sophomore had previous experience at the position, that didn’t preclude the need for the team as a whole to alter its strategy.
“[Kinsella and I] are different athletes—we have different setting styles, different speeds, and we match up with hitters differently,” Doyle said. “I’m not the tallest player, so [the team] switched up our defense a little bit, but we both overall are setters with the same game plan, and that’s why we were able to go pretty easily from one setter to another.”
Following the five-set loss to Princeton, Doyle led the Crimson to two straight wins on the road against league rivals Penn and Brown. The setter tallied double-digit assists and digs in both of those contests.
“Our first weekend with her setting, she was the one calming people down,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “She stepped into the leadership role perfectly. We were really proud of her.”
“That was a big deal because when I set last year, I was not so calm,” Doyle said. “It was definitely a sign of me maturing in my role as a setter and in knowing what the team needed that I was able to calmly lead the team in the moment.”
Although Wu praised the sophomore’s initial performance, Doyle said she has improved her play during her six games at setter.
“It just gets more and more comfortable,” she said. “The more I set the hitters in matches, the more I’m connecting with them. And the more I play defense with specific defenders, we learn who takes what ball and evolve together to move more and more as a unit.”
Her growing comfort at the position is not surprising given the history she has both with the sport and as a setter, beginning as far back as elementary school.
“I grew up with two older cousins who played volleyball,” Doyle began. “They taught me how to play volleyball. They would come up with drills for me, and I wanted to be just like them. They inspired me.”
Following in the footsteps of her older cousin Kate Fisher, a former setter at Georgetown, Doyle started setting.
“I was 10 years old, and I don’t think I hit five feet for a few years,” Doyle said. “I have this picture of me when I’m setting—I’m in extra, extra small spandex, and I’m wallowing in [them]. I was absolutely tiny. People would have laughed at me if I told them I wanted to hit … so I just started setting.”
Trying to improve at her position, Doyle often commuted to volleyball clubs an hour to 90 minutes away.
“I tried as hard as I could, and it turned out I was pretty okay, even though I was absolutely tiny,” Doyle said. “I’m not the biggest setter, but I’m quick. And that’s always been something I’ve capitalized on, both in the defensive role, running down really tough balls, and in the setting role, ... keeping [the ball] in play so my teammates can do something good with it.”
Even after playing setter for over half of her life, Doyle still finds herself developing new skills, especially earlier this season during her time as a defensive specialist.
“Starting the season with a real defensive focus has ingrained in me better defensive instincts,” she said. “I’ve been able to transfer that into the setting role. I do have better defense now because I spent so many preseason matches just focusing on the defense. That really let me develop that skill.”

Success is more rewarding when it’s in honor of a best friend. Former dual sport athlete Eric LaHaie ’02 found this out first hand, after dedicating his most recent ultra marathon finish to his late teammate, Niall Murphy ’03.
LaHaie took second place in a field of 153 competitors in the Sahara Race, a seven-day, 250-kilometer (roughly 155 mile) trek through the Valley of the Whales in Egypt.
At age 31, LaHaie was the top American finisher, completing the endurance competition in just over 28 hours. Dan Parr of the United Kingdom won the race, crossing the finish line just three hours faster.
The course proved difficult, as the elements victimized competitors.
“The hardest part of the Sahara Race, and what differed from the previous two [long distance races] I have done, was the heat,” LaHaie wrote in an email. “It was hot in the [Gobi and Atacama], but in the Sahara it was just constant and sort of baking heat because of the all the sand which absorbs the heat and also reflects the sun back up at you. Sort of a double whammy.”
While water was provided throughout the course, racers mostly supported themselves, carrying 15 to 20 pounds of supplies on their backs.
But as LaHaie constantly reminds himself, the difficulties he experiences during ultra marathon races do not compare to those faced by his best friend.
Murphy, a teammate of LaHaie on both the football and track teams at Harvard, died suddenly from complications of juvenile diabetes on Feb. 16 earlier this year.
“It was quite the shock for me, as it was for all of Niall’s loved ones,” LaHaie said. “It was just so sudden and he left us way too early.”
LaHaie and Murphy met during pre-season football camp in 1999. Both played safety in the fall and ran hurdles in the spring. “I was one year ahead of him, but we had an instant bond,” LaHaie said. “We spent a lot of time together and became the closest of friends.”
The duo’s chemistry was obvious, as the all-Ivy safeties contributed to a defense that helped Harvard complete an undefeated and untied season in 2001.
“Among a team of friends, they were like family,” Harvard football coach Tim Murphy said. “They were like brothers.”
The two competed together for the last time at the 2003 Oxford-Cambridge Track Meet in England, winning the highly coveted Naughton Trophy.
Since the end of his college career, LaHaie has found other ways to fuel his competitive drive, finishing among the top 10 in six major ultra-endurance races on four different continents.
LaHaie’s success does not surprise his college football coach.
“That’s Eric LaHaie,” Tim Murphy said. “Whatever he does, it’s going to be 1000 miles per hour, full commitment.”
LaHaie cites his experience as an athlete at Harvard as a major contributor to his success in endurance competitions.
“I think [playing football and running track] has really helped with the training aspect of preparing for these races,” LaHaie said. “I am used to setting a goal athletically and working hard through practice and training to achieve that goal. Harvard Football and Harvard Track really set this precedent for me.”
But since February, honoring Murphy’s legacy has become LaHaie’s primary motivation in both training and competition.
“He had every opportunity to back down or to fall back on excuses, but he never did,” LaHaie said. “Niall always lived life to the fullest, and he would love a challenge like running 250 kilometers over seven days, self-supported, across the Sahara Desert. So I think this was a great way to honor his memory a bit.”
While LaHaie’s performances in ultra marathons and other ultra-endurance competitions are laudable, it is his fundraising efforts that are perhaps most meaningful. So far, he has raised $13,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) in Murphy’s honor.
“The overall experience of raising funds and running the Sahara Race in Niall’s name has been a rewarding experience,” LaHaie said.” “He was such a great individual and we will never forget him, and this campaign was just one way of showing that.”
LaHaie will continue to raise funds for the JDRF in his future major races. He hopes to partner with the charity to raise awareness about the disease and increase the number of competitors who fundraise for the cause.
And as time passes, LaHaie’s memory of his relationship with Murphy will never fade.
“I still think about him everyday and miss him so much, but I just try to think about all the good times we had and what a great friend he was,” LaHaie said. “I was so lucky to have him in my life and I will never forget him.”
