The Harvard Student Composers Festival took place Dec. 2 - Dec. 5. Sponsored by the Office for the Arts, Harvard University Department of Music, Harvard Composers Association, and the Harvard Undergraduate Songwriters Collective, the 2020 CompFest was a four-day event that sought to highlight student composers of all different musical genres and concentrations. Panelists ranged from up and coming Harvard alumni to high profile guest artists, and students all across the college signed up to perform.
The festival kicked off on Wednesday, Dec. 2 with a Keynote speaker dialogue between three artists: jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman ’91, Cuban-born conductor Tania León, and newly ascended artistic director Rhiannon Giddens, moderated by Harvard’s chair of the Department of Music, Ingrid Monson. The primary objective was to foster a conversation about the compositional process as a pretext for the students who were about to showcase their own creations.
“Now is the time [students] can create,” said the OFA production coordinator, Dana E. Knox, on the topic of this discussion. “This dialogue demystifies the process of how you can compose if you haven’t had the experience before, and what resources are available here at Harvard to help you.”
The following three days featured three “Spotlight Series” events with nine original compositions by Harvard College students, moderated by various faculty respondents. The idea was to create a platform for artists to perform and connect with a wider community after months of isolation.
“You are never going to know whether the music works, and if it’s getting across what you want to get across if you haven’t had a conversation with an audience,” said Joy B. Nesbitt ’21, a student composer who will be presenting her new album made during quarantine. “I feel lucky to be able to share my stuff with the Harvard community as I’m getting ready to release my album. It’s a really good opportunity to allow people to get to know what kind of stuff I’m making. It will help me out in the long run.”
“Most of us do this because we love playing for people and sharing with the world,” said programming director Veronica F. Leahy ‘23, reflecting on the adverse effects of the pandemic on the performance scene. Being an artist herself, Leahy said she is feeling the absence of artistic outlets first hand.
“Sometimes we forget that people are still being creative, right now.”
“It’s really heartwarming that we’re going to see 30 young composers all showing us how they’re actually a beacon for us, that we can still be creative, and that something good can come out of this situation,” Leahy said.
Staying true to its celebratory spirit, the event closed out with a Cabaret night on Saturday, Dec. 5, featuring more than twenty original compositions performed by students in a grand finale to the program.
“Our guiding principle for the whole festival is really keeping it open to all genres of music,” said Leahy. “The Cabaret is designed to be an event where we can really reflect all of the creative diversity at Harvard. We’re going to have musical theater pieces, contemporary classical pieces, jazz pieces, RNB, folk, we got stuff from all of the musical spectrum.”
At the heart of the wide range of talent lies a fundamental belief rooted in diversity and representation, reflects Knox. “This is accessible to anybody, at any experience level, to start expressing themselves.”

Due to the pandemic, Harvard traditions have had to look a little different this year, and Crimson Jam, Harvard’s annual concert and block party, was no exception. Normally held at the start of the fall semester, this year’s Jam was pushed to Nov. 20 as part of the Harvard College Events Board “Harvard-Yale Spirit Week” programming, meant to take the place of the annual Harvard-Yale football game.
This year’s entirely virtual Jam featured a mixology class, an astrologist, and, as the main event, a concert broadcasted over Vimeo featuring R&B artist Giveon, with opening acts from Harvard student talent Uzo L. Ngwu ‘23 and the Yard Bops.
Giveon is a Long Beach-based musician perhaps best known for “Chicago Freestyle,” his recent collaboration with Drake. His eight song set featured a mixture of songs from his debut album “TAKE TIME” and his EP “When it's All Said and Done” which was released just last month.
In between songs, Giveon lamented the awkwardness of an audience-less performance, at one point saying to his accompanist, “Can we clap for ourselves after?” A few songs later, trying to make the most of the virtual format, Giveon attempted to engage viewers of the livestream in a call and response. “That was an attempt at doing something engaging,” he said once the song ended.
After his performance, Giveon participated in a Q&A session with questions that had been sourced from Harvard students. In addition to sharing his favorite color (forest-green) and his favorite movie (Pixar’s “Coco,” which he watches once or twice a week), he spoke a little about his experience as a young artist. “I used to be too much of a realist. I feel like that’s where people mess up. They set goals that make sense,” Giveon said. “Once you start setting goals that make sense, you already failed. So, that’s why I try to say be as unrealistic as possible.”
Along with Giveon, the Jam featured two student performances. Uzo L. Ngwu ‘23 opened the night with pre-recorded acoustic covers of Harry Styles’ “Canyon Moon” and Corraine Bailey Rae’s “Put Your Records On.” Ngwu had originally auditioned to perform at last year's Yardfest, which was canceled after students were sent home last spring. This fall she was approached by the CEB to audition again for the virtual Jam.
While Ngwu enjoyed the experience of performing, she expressed that the virtual format lacked a certain element of interactivity. “I don't think there is anything wrong with it being virtual, but I was expecting a Zoom to interact with people as it was happening. It was more so a livestream, which I guess logistically does make more sense if you’re worried about Zoom bombers, but it also made it a little impersonal because I thought it would be fun to chat with people while it was going on,” Ngwu said.She also discussed the difficulties of performing remotely. “With the absence of an audience you just have to internally give yourself that energy because you have nothing to draw off of.”
Ngwu’s performance was followed by the Yard Bops, a group that had also originally formed in the lead up to the auditions for last year’s Yard Fest. The group performed an upbeat medley which included selections of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition,” Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now,” and Lizzo’s “Juice.”
According to the lead singer Isabella E. Pena ‘23 the process of recording each performer’s part remotely was very different from their rehearsals last spring. “We had bass and drums put together their parts first and then send the audio. Then we would record over it. So it was just slowly piecing together everything,” Pena said.
While Pena shared Ngwu’s sentiments about the downfalls of a virtual performance, she remained happy with the final product. “It wasn’t exactly what it would have been on campus, but it was an incredible alternative, and what this pandemic has shown us is that we have to be adaptive and flexible, and I’m glad that we did it.”

The Harvard Art Museums’ staff continues to foster arts appreciation within the greater community, despite the challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. While the brick and mortar museums are temporarily closed, the Harvard Art Museums have expanded their online presence, broadcasting an array of virtual art talks on Zoom. “Creature Features” is just one of these new online series, but there’s one thing that sets it apart from the rest: “Creature Features” is geared towards families with children aged six and up.
During a “Creature Feature” talk, museum staff discuss works of art from the Harvard collection that depict magical creatures. At “Fantastic Beings by Michelangelo,” the most recent “Creature Feature,” curators Margaret M. Grasselli ‘73 and Joachim Homann walked the viewers through an analysis of a 1521 drawing by Michelangelo Buonarroti entitled “Goldsmith’s Designs, Including Two Ideas for an Oil Lamp.” The drawing, conducted in black chalk on beige antique laid paper, consists of several independent sketches laid out on the same page. Two of these sketches are much more developed and detailed than the others. One is the head of an imaginary goat-like beast, and the other is a profile of a crouching humanoid figure. After a methodical inspection of the drawing, Grasselli and Homann revealed that the two prominent sketches are in fact ideas for oil lamps. They then showed an oil lamp of similar design, titled “Lamp in the Form of an Ass’s Head,” that was made around the same time that Michelangelo had made this drawing.
When asked about preparing for the “Creature Feature,” Grasselli responded, “It was quite a challenge to adapt the presentation to a younger audience and to avoid using art history terms and specialized vocabulary.” But although the discussion led by Grasselli and Homann was geared towards younger audiences, it was not oversimplified — an adult would still find the talk interesting and educational. Grasselli went on to disclose, “I have heard from a number of adults who attended that they enjoyed the program precisely because we explained things in a way that they also could understand and appreciate.” That’s what makes “Creature Features” special.
When asked about “Creature Features” after the event, Melissa A. McCloskey, a mother of two boys, said, “The people who ran the event made it very relatable to kids. They equated the Michelangelo drawings to monsters, and that’s what kids relate to. It never got boring.”
Throughout the art talk, Grasselli and Homann paused to ask questions to the children in attendance. Before delving into an analysis of “Goldsmith’s Designs,” Grasselli opened up to the Zoom attendees, saying, “I wonder if you might share with us what your favorite thing is to draw,” prompting responses like “fish” and “flowers.” Questions like this one helped to keep kids focused throughout the “Creature Feature.” Grasselli brought the kids into the lecture so that they felt a part of what was being discussed, and so that they could relate to the Michelangelo drawing at hand.
At the end of the Zoom event, Grasselli asked the kids to design their own creature lamp and share it with the Harvard Art Museums online. Not only did the “Creature Feature” expose young children to art history, but it also encouraged them to be active in the arts community and start drawing. This sentiment was expressed clearly by Joachim Homann, when he said, “I think we all should be drawing more.” “Creature Features” are not just about studying artists of the past — but creating the artists of the future.
“Creature Features” are free, and offered once a month on Saturdays at 10am on Zoom.

Here’s a fun drinking game to play while watching “Hillbilly Elegy” (directed by Ron Howard): Take a shot every time someone yells. Take another every time Glenn Close’s Mamaw stumbles angrily toward someone. One more anytime someone calls someone else “loser” or “stupid.” Maybe then, at least, the movie will become semi-bearable.
“Hillbilly Elegy” is based on a 2016 memoir of the same name that follows J.D. Vance (Gabriel Basso), a Yale law student, as he balances his complicated relationship with his working class family in Appalachia and his desire for a better life. The plot switches between Vance’s chaotic childhood in Middletown, Ohio and his adulthood, when he is called back to his hometown to handle his mother’s heroin overdose.
In general, “Hillbilly Elegy” plays like a bad high school theater production — all melodrama with no nuance or honesty. It's not that there’s no talent here. Amy Adams fully embodies Bev, J.D. Vance’s emotionally unstable drug-addicted mother, and Glenn Close is equally dedicated in her role of Vance’s grandmother, Mamaw. Unfortunately, however, these two characters are so over-the-top in their cruelty that any art the actresses bring to their roles is lost under a mirage of violence, sudden outbursts, and Appalachian drawl. The other performances are, in a word, boring — each character serving the singular purpose of holding space until someone yells again.
All the yelling isn’t “Hillbilly Elegy”’s fundamental problem, though; rather, it’s the fact that the movie is downright unkind to its characters. According to “Hillbilly Elegy,” the root cause of the character’s poverty, addiction, and violent behavior is a failure to take responsibility for themselves and others. As Mamaw says to J.D. in the last third of the film, “You gotta decide. You want to be someone or not.” While “Hillbilly Elegy”'s characters recoil anytime someone is accused of being stupid, the film itself is no kinder — arguing that the characters’ failures are due to their own volition. The people of Appalachia, as Mamaw says of her daughter, “just stopped trying.”
The film does have something to say about abuse and addiction and how love and family loyalty can cross into the zone of codependence and enablement. But by focusing too much on the mania and violence of the story, it divorces its characters from any context that would make them honest or human.
Bev, for example, is shown to be violent and drug-addled because she gave up, and because people enabled her to do so. The movie only alludes to the possibility that there might be context to Bev’s pain. There’s a voiceover that mentions she started using drugs after her dad died because she was especially close to him, but the movie never provides a window into their relationship. There is a flashback to Bev’s abusive childhood home, but it is shot through a hazy filter with obscured faces, as though to lessen the scene’s importance. Despite this brief mention of past trauma, the film only seems interested in portraying Bev in a light that blames her for her own sorrows.
Perhaps the worst example of the film’s heartless portrayal of Bev is in her rotating series of boyfriends. At the end of the film, one of Bev’s partners violently accuses her of being “a whore,” which sends J.D. into a rage. However, other than through J.D.'s outburst, the movie doesn’t try to deny this allegation. “Hillbilly Elegy” gives no context to any of Bev’s relationships, each man only functioning to demonstrate the large quantity of boyfriends in her life, and, by failing to flesh Bev out, endorses all the bad things others say about her.
Maybe this would all be palatable if the film positioned itself as a story about unusually selfish and lazy people, but that’s not the context of the movie. When Vance’s memoir was originally released, it was lauded as a piece that explained why the white working class voted for Trump. The movie embraces that distinction, interweaving generalizations about “real America” throughout, a term it doesn’t outwardly use, but might as well.
And what does “Hillbilly Elegy” have to say about the state of America?
Honestly, close to nothing. There are hints at a broken political system: Bev lacks health insurance (but she let it lapse, so that's on her), and there aren’t enough resources at either the hospital or the rehab center (which is framed more as a problem caused by heartless bureaucrats, than anything systematic). As for class issues, “Hillbilly Elegy” handles socioeconomic differences about as well as “Titanic” does, boiling poverty down to not knowing what fork to use at a fancy dinner. Race barely makes a mark on the film, other than through Mamaw’s off-handed racist comments and an annoying we’re-all-the-same-in-the-end type scene, where Usha (Freida Pinto), J.D.’s Indian-American girlfriend, comments that J.D.’s family story is almost identical to her dad’s experience immigrating to America.
What is so frustrating about “Hillbilly Elegy” is that, at its core, the film argues the point that the rest of Americans dismiss Appalachia too easily, but then it turns around and participates in that dismissal. As the movie suggests, there are certainly important stories to be told from the region, and about poverty in rural America more broadly. Sadly, “Hillbilly Elegy” is just not one of them.

In the aftermath of one of the most divisive US elections in recent memory, A24’s recent release “Boys State” provides a timely, thoughtful look at America’s political landscape. A political documentary directed by Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss, the film follows the Texas Boys State, an annual one-week program where a thousand high school students are put to the task of creating their own government. With dynamic shot composition, intimate character development, and a well-paced story, the film serves as a stunning microcosm of the state of US politics.
The cinematography and editing in “Boys State” creates a comprehensive and immersive experience. The director of photography, Thorsten Thielow, provides a strong sense of both breadth and depth through sequences that feature a carefully patterned array of wide, medium, and tight shots. Each shot builds upon the previous one with increasing momentum, such that the film is able to convey the intensity of the Boys State program well. The competition feels incredibly real and the teenagers’ investment in it wholly believable. Thielow also uses unique framing and moving shots to highlight important moments, such as at the State Chair election where the camera pans around a candidate on stage until he's silhouetted against the crowd, their arms in the air and fists pumping. These dynamic choices capture the raw energy and suspense of his rousing speech.
The speech was delivered by René, who ended up winning the position for the Nationalists Party. A Black American and the eloquent and snappy voice of left-leaning politics at the program, his is just one perspective viewers are given access to. Others include Ben, a Reagan-obsessed intellectual; Robert, a crowd pleaser willing to give up his personal beliefs to get the vote; and Steven, the “quiet of the storm” progressive son of an undocumented immigrant. Their diverse backgrounds and beliefs serve as launching pads for the issues that rise to the top of debates, such as abortion and gun rights.
Unsurprisingly given all the debates, The Texas Boys State is a heavy, high-strung environment, and yet McBaine and Moss are able to mediate and relieve the tension with impeccable control and timing. While on one hand, "Boys State" reveals much about political anarchy and stifling masculinity, these hefty themes are carefully interspersed with heartfelt speeches and calls for love and connection.
The film is all about this balance between hostility and peace. This is evident in the film's nerve-racking run up to speeches for the highest office, the Governor, where René is pictured drinking out of a water gallon jug and Steven is aggressively biting into a sub. This tense moment concludes with Steven finally on stage, but abandoning his notes and delivering a speech from the heart that results in a cathartic and tear-jerking standing ovation. We have displays of traditional masculinity with raucous chanting, frequent and fierce sports contests, and numerous passionate anti-abortion speeches on one hand, but there is also the lighthearted and even contemplative Talent Show where a boy races the clock to finish a Rubik’s Cube and the audience waves their phone’s flashlights to a sobering performance of “Hallelujjah.” Seemingly meaningless moments, like a rotating shot of the decorative ceiling of the Texas State Capitol, a scene where a Boys State participant pets a turtle, and a view of the trees in Austin as the sun peeks through, abound in the film and act as pillow shots that give the viewer the opportunity to digest the events prior. It's this tonal balance that creates the necessary space for the film’s heavier questions without overburdening viewers.
Intense, thought-provoking, and optimistic, “Boys State” represents all the boiling tensions of modern US political discourse. In its documentation of a riveting Boys State gubernatorial race, "Boys State" also acts as a timely companion to the recent Presidential election and a thoughtful exploration of many of the questions left in its wake..

In an era of a seemingly constant pandemic-born isolation, sound soothes the soul. Adolescents brimming with angst slouch atop their beds, bobbing their heads to a beloved beat. Solitary walks are elevated with the right playlist for the given weather and moment. Despite the plummeting relevance of Hollywood, both traditional and fresh music streaming services have witnessed a burst of popularity.
Of course, not all music is a fit for the needs of trapped-at-home listeners. At times, listening incessantly to trending tracks, songs that have been cranked out by the record giants, may render music more far away than ever before; and a faceless tune will do little to humanize or properly address the very private, personal sufferings of the present moment.
Never fear, for “Mirror Sound” is here.
Written by drum player and record-producer Spencer Tweedy alongside graphic designer and creative director Lawrence Azerrad (Azerrad was awarded the Grammy for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package in 2017 for “The Voyager Golden Record: 40th Anniversary Edition”), “Mirror Sound” explains itself as “A Look into the People and Processes behind Self-Recorded Music.”
Interspersed between many small-font, dense paragraphs that studiously observe the intricate wonders of self-recording are vibrant photographs of the creators themselves in their musical habitats. The images are sensibly retro while maintaining an endearing homeiness. One frame features a tenderly smiling Bobb Bruno holding his dog against his chest, sitting in front of layers of keyboards, peculiar-looking stuffed animals, and a sleek turquoise electric guitar. Many photographs capture artists alone in the comfort of their familiar workspaces. From the serene expressions, it is evident that they have made peace with solitude.
In fact, the first chapter of the book is titled “The Sound of Solitude.” The cover image presents a pensive Melina Duterte (Jay Som) bathed in sunlight and staring steadily at the camera. On the left of the photo, a quote: “I think that the feeling of solitude is what makes my writing and recording sound the way it goes.”
“Mirror Sound” also challenges readers to work with what they have, not with what is out of reach. The most memorable anecdotes of acclaimed self-recorder’s’ beginnings are sanctified by a particular humility, a privacy that is just about extinct in the mainstream music-making process. The text is peppered with “De-” and “Re-,” whether it be dismantling or repurposing things — melodies, stories, or sentiments — that have always been present either within or beside us.
“An aim of Mirror Sound is to deconstruct the very making — the actual doing,” musician Carrie Brownstein writes in the Foreword. “This book is also about a fundamental reimagining of ourselves and the spaces in which we create and invent.”
This reminder is well suited for the quarantine, a time in which people are largely left to their own devices — and are denied anything new. It is both refreshing and heartwarming to witness the journeys of these self-recorders, creators who have mastered honoring the little things in order to make a song that’s big.
Moreover, “Mirror Sound” reprimands its readers for mistaking isolation for silence. The privatude of our rooms, the book argues passionately, is more than capable of producing a sound unheard of before. What is intimately personal also possesses a magical expansiveness, an ability to strike a chord within the staggeringly public, precisely because it dares to be specific.
“It’s not that the recording studio got smaller, it’s that the bedroom became bigger,” Bronwstein explains. “Not literally, but in the way privacy itself has collapsed, the way we collectively perceive intimacy as a public offering.”
“This is about the broadcast of selfhood in the form of songs, about inviting people into our small spaces until we realize the spaces aren’t small at all, nor our experiences insular and isolated,” she continues. “These stories are defiantly anto-diminutive, proof that there are giants inside us that with the right tools can hurl sounds twice our size upon the landscape.”

“If you could go back, who would you want to meet?” This epigraph is simply all that needs to be asked before stepping into the cafe depicted in “Before the coffee gets cold.” Written by former producer, writer, and director for the Sonic Snail theatrical group Toshikazu Kawaguchi, this breakout semi-anthological novel portrays a cafe where it is possible to return to the past.
Toshikazu plays with science fiction and fantasy artfully, outlining a simple and easily comprehensible magic system that gives way to much larger stories of life, grief, and regret. Time travel in fiction is a pesky thing filled with contradictions and complexities, but Toshikazu lays out a system of time travel that is unconvoluted and beautifully simple: there are just five rules. As the cafe’s waitress explains in the book’s first few pages, there is no leaving the cafe in the past, therefore you can only meet whomever has been to the cafe before, and under no circumstances can you alter the present by visiting the past. By removing the possibility of cause and effect, Toshikazu creates a story where the time travel is secondary to the development of characters.
Toshikazu lays out four stories of four travelers that utilize the cafe’s mysterious service. The novel is split into four sections detailing the stories of these travellers, but along the way, the lives of the cafe’s staff are illuminated. As the stories progress, the shifting spotlight is slowly revealing the true subject of the novel — Kazu Tokita; the waitress whose coffee pour allows for time travel.
While the stories that Toshikazu details are character studies that explore grief, struggle, regret, and finding meaning in life, it is Kazu’s story that ultimately ties the patrons of the cafe to one another and unifies the novel. Toshikazu’s theatrical past is evident in his choice to split the novel into four pieces where each act remains situated solely in the setting of the cafe. Each disparate story does not blend into one another besides the presence and involvement of Kazu’s pour and the characters of her life that surround her.
Weaving stories through Kazu’s life slowly chips away at her tough and stoic exterior to reveal the past that she grapples with. Through the dissection of Kazu’s customers’ past mistakes and regrets, Kazu’s sorrows and grievances are also illuminated. It is not simply through the lessons taught by each character that Toshikazu reveals the purpose of the novel, though, but also through the slow burn of Kazu’s story alongside these other narratives. The entire novel is not fully settled until Kazu, to whom the audience has slowly grown attached as one of the only constants in the novel, receives the same treatment as other guests to the Cafe. Solemn and difficult to interpret, Kazu’s impenetrable past is the slowest and most important story that is wrapped only at the conclusion of all four acts.
Toshikazu writes sorrowful stories that somehow still leave you feeling content with their conclusions. As one story suggests, the happiness that we can glean from sadness and sorrow is the meaning that we give to that feeling of sadness. The premise that the present cannot be manipulated by time travel already presents stories of grief as hopeless, but this novel shows that although the past cannot be changed, the future is still malleable and open to shifts in direction. The characters of the stories that Toshikazu portrays accept the rule that the past is unchangeable, but their futures, or the futures of those they influence in the present, are undoubtedly changed by the cafe’s power to time travel.
Toshikazu is able to use a literary trope as complex and convoluted as time travel to reveal our relationships to the past and our obligation to do what we can to make sure the past is not in vain. This charmingly magical novel is about discovering happiness despite the pasts that we desperately want to revisit. Even when we can revisit our past, our future happiness is up to us to discover and create.

Chloe Gong’s young adult fantasy debut “These Violent Delights,” already a New York Times Bestseller, is well-deserving of the tidal waves of praise it has received since its release. A “Romeo and Juliet” retelling set in 1920s Shanghai, “These Violent Delights” follows sometime star-crossed lovers, sometime mortal enemies Roma Montagov and Juliette Cai, the heirs of two rival gangs in an ever-changing city. Roma and Juliette, along with a brilliant ensemble of supporting characters, are forced to work together to hunt down a monster that has begun to terrorize their city before everyone they love falls victim to the monster’s viral madness.
Gong masterfully balances gorgeous prose with an engaging, fast-paced plot. The descriptions of the settings and aesthetics of the novel are beautifully written, giving readers vivid and compelling imagery of the glitz and gore of gang-run Shanghai and perfectly accentuating the story. Thankfully, these detailed depictions also never come at the sacrifice of the pacing of the novel. Each plot point is given equal care and is delivered with a powerful punch, well underscored by the encapsulating nature of Gong’s writing.
This equilibrium is aided by the high stakes built up over the course of the entire novel. The central conflict of “These Violent Delights'' is quite literally a life-or-death matter for Roma and Juliette. Trying to uncover the mystery of the monster to save their city and protect their loved ones would be gripping enough, but this tension is deepened by the all-encompassing nature of their families’ blood feud. Emotions understandably run high throughout the novel, and these emotions — whether they play out through violence, verbal outburst, or internalization — are given the utmost respect and validity, enrapturing the audience in the rollercoaster narrative arcs through which Gong sends her characters. All of this conflict, combined with incisive and nuanced commentary on colonialism, identity, and privilege, makes for a tale of epic proportions that leaps off the page.
“These Violent Delights” is a wholly original retelling of Shakespeare’s most infamous tale of young love. Gong takes elements from “Romeo and Juliet” and transforms them into something wholly her own. The premise of ill-fated lovers, separated by family loyalties, is prominently there, but many of the finer details and moments are cleverly reworked within the historical fantasy context. The classic touchstones of the tragic love story are excellently defamiliarized, so that many of the moments that come from Shakespeare’s text are covert and a joy to uncover. Because of the discretion with which the retold aspects of “These Violent Delights” are brought in and reimagined, the story remains delightfully unpredictable.
The inevitable elegance of a classic Shakespeare romance is bolstered by the point of view used throughout the story; “these Violent Delights” is told from an omniscient third-person point of view. Not only does this give the audience a layered understanding of each main character’s inner psyche, but it also allows the audience to clearly follow each of the many different narrative threads this story holds. The viewpoint is also accentuated by allusion to future scenes in the book (and the eventual series, as “These Violent Delights” left readers on a riveting cliffhanger) that built up anticipation, propelling the reader through this page-turner of a novel. By thoughtfully executing this use of a third person omniscient perspective, “These Violent Delights” manages to replicate the feeling of watching a tragedy unfold live on stage.
“These Violent Delights” is a standout literary release of 2020. Well worth the warm reception it’s received since its release, this novel spins a unique take on star-crossed love, family dynamics, and the balance between honor, duty, and desire.

If anybody has the Midas touch, it is Jack Nicholson.
One of Hollywood’s finest, the three-time Academy award winner has paved an enduring legacy for himself by grace of an unparalleled sequence of arresting performances. What renders Nicholson’s contribution to “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” so remarkable is his uncanny ability to portray moral ambiguity. It is impossible to discern whether Randle McMurphy — the film’s protagonist — is melancholic, amused, or furious at any given moment. Even as a delighted McMurphy galvanizes his fellow residents to rebel against the institution’s tedious rules, there exists a deeper, more opaque emotion underneath his ecstatic exterior.
The construction of such a cryptic protagonist presents a rare moment in film. Often, we evaluate stories based on their ability to draw the viewer into the confines of a character’s psyche. Ingenious screenwriters can effortlessly convey the most compelling vulnerabilities of their characters.
With McMurphy, however, there is no vulnerability save the absence of wanting to be vulnerable. Time and time again, the young sociopath resists the siren song of sentimental honesty in the face of anybody, even himself. The only character that McMurphy is remotely bone fide towards is Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), a Native American patient who feigns mental illness to be left alone at the institution. Perhaps McMurphy’s most euphoric moment is when he realizes this.
“Here. Want some gum?” McMurphy asks, extending a pack of Juicy Fruit towards his stoic-faced friend. Bromden accepts, muttering a soft “Thank you.” It is the first and last time McMurphy appears genuinely surprised throughout the film.
Critically, this moment of pure surprise does not arrive when McMurphy wakes to realize he has missed his final chance of escape, but when he stumbles upon the humanity of another individual navigating the same, dehumanizing system. What is assumably so heartening to McMurphy about Bromden’s sanity is the fact that Bromden has outsmarted the very institution designed to disenfranchise him.
“Ah, Juicy Fruit,” Bromden says to a startled McMurphy.
“Well, you sly son of a bitch, Chief,” a wide-eyed McMurphy says. “Can you hear me too?”
“You bet.” A lazy smile graces the towering man’s weathered face.
“You fooled ‘em, Chief. You fooled ‘em, you fooled ‘em all. Goddamn.” Then McMurphy sobers up. “What are we doing in here, Chief?”
The exchange is as hilarious as it is heartbreaking. There is something so foundationally wrong about the scene, both in its visual and thematic presentation: two intelligent, cognizant human beings dressed in starched white gowns and sitting on a bench outside the very room where they will be subject to electrotherapy.
What differentiates “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” from other American greats is its ability to refuse answers. No doubt Miloš Forman’s directorial masterpiece is a scalding criticism of not just disastrous mental asylums, but the entire American institution. No question the film illuminates the institution’s alarming power to brand anybody they choose as manic or undeserving of societal dignity.
The film also dares to raise subtle hypotheticals instead of providing clear cut answers to Forman's questions of the role of the American institution. What if McMurphy had successfully escaped? Would he have inflicted terrors onto society stoically and unapologetically, or would he have lived a decent life?
Note that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the very awards that have helped to immortalize the film — is one of the country’s most enduring institutions. It would also be remiss to say that “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Silence of the Lambs,” two of three films to win all five major Academy Awards, wrestle with the paradox of human mania.
45 years have passed since the sensational premiere of one of America’s most celebrated motion pictures. To this day, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” refuses to yield to the decades, refuses to bend its relevance to the modern world. If anything, the film stands taller and prouder, as the years race by: Its enduring heartbeat can be heard louder than ever before.

“home body” is the newest collection from Rupi Kaur, the pioneer of social media poetry whose first collection “milk and honey” stole the position of best-selling poetry collection of all time from “The Odyssey.” Kaur communicates everyday experiences of womanhood, trauma, migration, love, loss, and self in the form of straightforward, minimalist poems accompanied by emotionally honest line sketches. Her latest release, “home body” is an organic continuation of her previous two works in style and subject material. Rather than being redundant, it is Kaur’s distinctive emphasis on the self that firmly grounds her poems, along with her deeper exploration of heavier material — like depression, anxiety, and self-hate — that provide more substance to undergird her characteristically lavish and radical affirmations. A deeper vulnerability, coupled with her poems’ famous but oft-ridiculed simplicity, creates an uncomplicated, powerful final product.
What sets “home body” apart from Kaur’s previous collections is how it seems to settle on an origin story for the human condition — on a source for all our problems and our joys: “my mind / my body / and i.” Most of her poems relate to these abstractions in some way. Pain is traced to each of them, like how the “mind keeps running off to dark corners / and coming back with reasons for / why i am not enough,” how one can feel “foreign” in one’s body, and how our tentative identities feed anxieties that “i’ll disappoint the people who are counting on me / that i’ll never learn how to be happy…” Kaur discusses them through other lenses, such as love, rest, and wakefulness. One of the purest joys in life comes from their synergy, embodied in the first poem of the book[:] “after feeling disconnected for so long / my mind and body are finally / coming back to each other / - home body.” By placing this sentiment at the very front and back cover of the book, Kaur literally bookends the collection with the mind-body-identity relationship, asserting it as critical to living fully.
Kaur’s verses use metaphors and similes that spatialize and give form to mind, body, and identity, helping to conceptualize how each plays a part in our emotions. She alternately characterizes these elements as objects, imprinted upon by our experiences, or as individual beings with their own sense of agency. For example, the poem “there are miracles in me / waiting to happen / i am never giving up on myself” poses the self as divine and also mysterious, consisting of unexplored portals. The poem “there is a conversation / happening inside you / pay deep attention / to what your inner world / is saying” makes one conscious of the different components that coexist to make up a person. Through this internal world-building and grandiose, celestial imagery, Kaur provides a compelling understanding of the human body that doesn’t just deserve to be loved, but demands it.
“home body” provides much-needed truth-telling in face of the events of the past year. Kaur has written about people of color and immigrants before, but fleshes out their stories in this collection with specific anecdotes such as one about an immigrant father who must “keep [his] head down” and “work until [his] bones become dust.” She weaves in some more targeted responses to the resurgence of Black Lives Matter like “no one on this planet / is in more denial / than the white man / who … / still thinks racism and sexism / and all the world’s pain don’t exist.” She writes about productivity anxiety, a concern on many people’s minds as quarantine and remote working make it difficult to focus. She discusses the failings of an economic system that equates our value with our production, sure to be well received by a millennial and Gen Z generation more and more willing to embrace anti-capitalism. These political poems balance out the personal and individualistic pieces, giving voice both to the broader social issues of our times and the intimate anxieties they feed.
In “home body,” Kaur sets up a holy trinity for a rich life — one of mind, body, and identity. She uses her accessible and relatable writing to directly enlighten the reader. She holds space for vast emotions and, at the same time, scatters bite-sized images and pieces of language that act like rafts for the reader, providing a way out of negative rabbit holes and into portals to self-love, community, and justice. In a society where so much is wrong, Kaur assures us that all salvation ultimately comes from ourselves. When we are open to the universes inside of us, there are no limits to what we, and our world, can be.

From Flour Bakery, house elves, HUPD, and waves of well-dressed sophomores heading to punch events, many details of “We Keep the Dead Close,” by Becky Cooper ’10, will be familiar to Harvard students. There is something both exciting and disconcerting about identifying familiar and tangible elements of one’s daily life in a story, particularly one about murder and conspiracy. In fact, this experience is likely part of what drew Cooper into the story of Jane Britton, an archaeology graduate student at the university who was murdered in 1969. “We Keep the Dead Close” is part true crime mystery, part memoir, and part academic history all wrapped into one expansive narrative that spans nearly 50 years. Cooper covers a lot of ground and presents a number of questions far broader than the “whodunit,” but at times, it can also feel like the book gets lost in that expansive ambition.
The story revolves Cooper’s decade-long process of uncovering the truth of Jane’s life and murder. The 1969 murder made a splash in national media at the time: A promising 23-year-old Radcliffe grad and Harvard PhD student was found brutally murdered in her off-campus apartment — and the Cambridge police couldn’t come up with anyone to charge. Over the years, the story becomes something of a myth among Harvard archaeology students, particularly as students clung to the rumor that she was murdered by prominent Professor Karl Lamberg-Karlovksy after the two allegedly had an affair. The book describes how Cooper first heard the stories as an undergrad and grew increasingly attached to Jane’s story, unable to let go of the mystery and Cambridge long after graduation.
The true crime aspect of the book is impressively thorough, and the description paints vivid images. The unnecessary detail and extraneous discussion, however, ultimately weigh it down. The degree of research and documentation is certainly impressive, the fruits of Cooper’s hundreds of hours of travelling and interviewing and combing through thousands of pages of archives. Jane is not the only character who receives nuanced consideration and a development arc; Cooper takes a magnifying glass to nearly every figure even tangentially related to the case. For example, she explores Jane’s brother Boyd, his relationship to his parents, his career in the military, as well as the complexities of the academic careers of nearly all the professors Jane had in the department.
For the most part, these explorations are well-written and interesting in their own right, but taken together they start to feel like tangents distracting from the main story. As a memoir, this may reflect Cooper’s own pursuit of dead ends in the cold case, but for a mystery arc driven by the need for answers, all this information can feel tedious — especially when much of it is ultimately irrelevant to the final answer.
Another issue that impacts the pacing of the book is its temporal organization. The book has seven main parts, each of which consists of small sections, many of which are less than two pages. While there is usually a logical connection from one section to the next, they hop around in space and time to the point that piecing together the chronology of the book’s events — much less the revelations, in this case — becomes a struggle. Most of the confusion stems from time jumps within Cooper’s life as she gathers information. One moment she is in Cambridge and the next she is in New York (from a period before she moved to Cambridge the second time). Sometimes the narrative feels like it is just meandering, particularly for readers who are less interested in the politics of archaeology. Cooper teases the fact that the Cambridge police made a breakthrough in the case in 2018 then jumps into another rabbit hole of a theory — before reminding us once again that the breakthrough is still coming. While this is clearly meant to build suspense, the result toes the line between generating anticipation and frustration.
The book shines when it puts the spotlight on broader themes inspired by Jane’s story. Even though the rumor about the affair with Lamberg-Karlovksy was ultimately unsubstantiated, its persistence speaks to the gendered power dynamics in academia. The book explores these issues both in the 1960s and today with stories of female scholars across multiple institutions who were driven out of their programs. Near the end, Cooper focuses on the issue of sexual abuse and harassment in the field and the way institutions like Harvard have histories of silencing complaints and protecting their own. While these issues are about much more than just Harvard, the complexities of engaging with and operating within an institution so old and powerful are embedded in the narrative; Cooper’s shifting sentiments towards Harvard’s oddities and potentially shadowy corners likely ring true with many Harvard affiliates who end up with some combination of affection and jadedness.
The one theme that falls a little flat, however, seems to be Cooper’s repeated insistence on Jane’s complexity. A key part of Cooper’s journey seems to be grappling with understanding Jane as a full person, and the book even ends on this idea. Yet frankly, it seems a bit too obvious to deserve so much attention. Coopers writes, “Jane’s defining characteristic seemed to be her ability to evade straightforward description.” But isn’t that just because she was a human being? Sure, the media and the rumor mill tend to reduce people to caricatures, but it can’t be that surprising that Jane was hard to completely capture; is any person easy to fully understand?
Overall, “We Keep the Dead Close” is a valuable read for anyone enamored by questions of gender, power, and conspiracy in academia — or even, frankly, in Harvard itself. Yet, in terms of a true crime page turner or shocking murder mystery, this story may be a little dense and detail-oriented to do the job well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only halfway through the text is it confirmed that Kazu, the protagonist of Yu Miri’s novel “Tokyo Ueno Station,” is, indeed, dead.
In most books, the delay of such a major plot point would be a significant drawback. After all, isn’t it a failure on the author’s part if vital information about her central character is conveyed so late? The delayed revelation, however, exemplifies the subversive power of Yu’s text. If anything, Yu is devastatingly patient. Instead of relying on immediate impact, she bears witness to the minutiae of the mundane, drawing from ordinary moments to illuminate the dizzying panorama of life. Hers is a literary style that pays homage to her protagonist Kazu — dispossessed, lonely, and brimming with longing and quiet intelligence.
“Listen. To speak is to stumble, to hesitate, to detour and hit dead ends. To listen is straightforward. You can always just listen,” notes Kazu as he surveys the passersby at Ueno Station where he, along with many other homeless individuals, reside. This condition of hyper-sensitive listening defines Kazu’s character — ghostly and wistful, he haunts the metropolitan fixtures of Ueno steeped in history. Yu’s ghostly depiction of Kazu, however, holds a shrewd double meaning. Though Kazu can be read as a literal ghost, his spectral status serves as an allegory of society’s dispossession of and aversion to the homeless. “To be homeless,” Kazu reflects, “is to be ignored when people walk past while still being in full view of everything.” His observation echoes his experience — one of figurative invisibility.
In most novels, time moves in a single direction: forward. In Yu’s novel, however, time functions not as a line but as a sphere. Kazu’s narration takes the form of a disciplined stream of consciousness that is at once chaotic and uneasily lucid. The temporal fluidity of Yu’s prose lends itself to moments of stunning emotional resonance. Random encounters trigger Kazu’s memories: an exhibition of roses evokes the memory of his childhood home, the scent of perfume reminds him of a hostess friend, the name of the emperor’s child reminds him of his dead son. “And as I retreated into the future,” Kazu philosophizes as he reflects on the aimlessness of his life, “the only thing I could ever see was the past.” Kazu lives — swims — in memory. Memory alone lends shape and vibrancy to his life, as everyone he cares about is no longer alive.
Though the novel’s narration is organized around moments of profound loss, Yu is not one to indulge in melancholy. In fact, the remarkable stoicism with which Kazu recounts intense grief makes his loss all the more devastating. Toward the beginning of the text, Kazu recounts the sudden news of his only son Kōichi’s death. After the death, Kazu and his wife Setsuko visit their late son’s apartment. He states matter-of-factly, “Setsuko and I went to the apartment where Kōichi had lived for three years and stayed there. We lay on the futon, where he had died, until the morning.” Later, he reminisces on his interactions with a hostess named Junko. When he turns sixty, Kazu decides to return to his hometown and greets Junko one last time before his departure. He notes, “Sadness welled up in my throat, but I didn’t cry. I pulled her pale arm from the bouquet and shook her hand, and her arm moved lifelessly. And with that I never saw Junko again.” Kazu’s impassive exterior belies his desperation for companionship and connection.
Though Kazu is the novel’s undeniable protagonist, Ueno Station itself functions as both a backdrop and Yu’s most enigmatic “character.” At once historic and modern, immobile and rapidly changing, the station serves to welcome Kazu into its haven and, at other times, throw his dispossession into sharp relief. When the emperor and empress of Japan visit the Station, passersby crowd around as Kazu stands toward the margin of the crowd, overwhelmed by a mixture of awe and chagrin. He marvels at the emperor, who had “never known struggle, envy, or aimlessness, one that had lived the same seventy-three years as I had — we were both born in 1933.” During this encounter, Ueno Station expands into a microcosm of class. The monarchs becomes a fascinating foil to Kazu who, though the same age, has endured a life antithetical to that of the emperor.
It is ironic that, despite leading a life marred by loss, Kazu revels in moments of redemptive beauty. Yu’s is a story about a man who has lost everything — where to go from there? Why continue living, when everything that matters has departed permanently from one’s life?
Perhaps Yu’s most powerful and ambitious idea is that nothing truly disappears. As Kazu, dizzy with grief, stands at the edge of the Station, a montage of vivid memories flashes before his eyes. “Each moment is brilliant and charged with shadow,” he describes. “I felt not that I was watching the landscape but that I was being watched by it. Seen by each of the daffodils, dandelions, the butterbur flowers, the spring starflowers—.” Even in a climatic moment of loss, Kazu leans on the exceptional beauty of ordinary things. Mired in anguish, he admires the flowers, the quiet pulse of the city that has at once embraced and disowned him. It is this painful yet stunning duality that solidifies Yu’s presence as a towering voice in modern fiction.
“Tokyo Ueno Station” (Penguin Random House, 2020), translated by Morgan Giles, won the 2020 National Book Award in Translated Literature.

In any historical retelling, the use of individual memory can be tricky. On one hand, uncovering personal experiences can be deeply valuable, adding a human quality to generalized historical records of the past. On the other hand, using memory to craft narratives presents particular challenges when those stories pertain to war and national violence — which stories are amplified, and which are suppressed? How does one account for the voices that are inevitably left behind? More broadly, how can writers reconcile private and public accounts of destruction, turbulence, and change?
Korean-born poet Don Mee Choi probes these complex questions in her book “DMZ Colony,” winner of the 2020 National Book Award for Poetry. Drawing from her own and others’ experiences, Choi weaves a fragmented, dynamic archive of violence and healing, displacement and reconciliation. By interspersing her verse with photographs and oral testimonies, she underscores the importance of honoring personal experience when shaping histories of mourning.
Choi’s text is, first and foremost, an exercise in translation; much of it relies on Korean-to-English versions of interviews and written documents. However, the concept of translation quickly expands into a broader theme that addresses the complex tensions between the public and the private, the national and the personal, explored through the lens of a partitioned Korea. In her opening pages, Choi evokes the 38th parallel, the territory that formally demarcates North from South Korea. The Korean Demilitarized Zone — also called “DMZ” — that runs across the 38th parallel serves as a cohesive motif throughout her text.
Choi’s intertextual account of war and nationhood demands: Is longing ever our own? Our personal desires for national belonging, she demonstrates, are intrinsically connected to the stories of those who came before us. In the book’s first section, she relates her own experiences of fleeing to the United States during the military occupation of Korea under Park Chung-hee. Choi describes a photograph of her father — who worked as a freelance journalist during Park’s military dictatorship — holding a camera amidst a crowd of high-ranking government officials. Because she was born a year after Park’s coup, her knowledge of the era draws heavily from her father’s testimony. Reflecting on the intergenerational nature of memory, she muses, “Memory’s memory. Memory’s child. My memory lives inside my father’s camera, the site where my memory was born, where my retina and my father’s overlap.”
Choi’s incorporation of others’ experiences does much to elevate her text. Her writing’s intertextual bent marks a democratic intention, a desire to involve multiple voices in her account of national violence. At times, however, she relies too heavily on others’ voices — rather than her own poetic craft — to convey the urgency and grief that characterized Korea’s colonial era. A section titled “Wings of Return,” for instance, revolves around the war-time experiences of Ahn Hak-sŏp, a former political prisoner and North Korean apologist who resides near the DMZ. In 1953, Ahn was arrested and jailed in Seoul. Choi translates his harrowing memories of imprisonment from Korean to English: “I met with someone who resisted despite being tortured over a month with water and electricity … the stench of puss from his body was unbearable … he was beaten so much that all of his skin had blistered.”
In a later section titled “The Orphans,” Choi traces the experiences of eight women who survived the Sancheong-Hamyang massacre — conducted by soldiers in the South Korean Army 11th Division during the Korean War — in which a total of 705 civilians were killed. Choi juxtaposes photographs of their written testimonies with typed paragraphs of their English translations. An orphan by the name of Cheo Geum-jeom, who was 13 at the time of the massacre, recalls the blurred chaos of the moment: “Somehow it was so quiet that I could hear everything inside my head. Somehow I jumped up. All the corpses were burning. Somehow my mother was headless.” Choi’s translations are undeniably essential in readers’ understanding of these macabre scenes. However, in this chapter and others, her writing seems expository rather than introspective or creative. It is not Choi’s writing that evokes visceral anguish from readers — but rather the words of the survivors she documents.
Choi’s verse is at its most interesting in the book’s final section titled “(Neo) (=) (Angels).” She imbues these poems with her own creative voice, rather than relying disproportionately on others’ accounts to lend impact and urgency to her text. As the section title suggests, Choi harkens back to motifs of orphans, angels, and flight to underscore the existential displacement that inevitably accompanies colonial structures. Reflecting on her generation of Koreans who grew up following Park’s coup, she claims, “We too were born during the war, the year of the student revolution, after the coup, always during martial law. We are all orphans, orphans who aren’t orphans. Angels who aren’t angels. We too cried.” The photographs of children that accompany Choi’s verses lend a haunting intimacy to her ruminations.
“It takes billions of years for light to reach us through the galaxies, which is to say, History is ever arriving,” Choi reflects before launching into her section “The Orphans.” Indeed, her entire text seems to watch her wrestle with the question – or the problem, perhaps — of history. At its best, Choi’s poetry is an act of collective witness, a testament to the power of remembrance in honoring the past while orienting ourselves toward the future.

We began our tenure as the Crimson Arts Board’s Blog Executives full of optimism, enthusiasm, and whimsy. The purview of the Arts Blog is so wide that nobody, not even us, could define its limits. We were ready to challenge our writers to produce the most esoteric content they could — as long as it had some connection to “arts” or “popular culture” or, sometimes, “new media.” We even planned to assign writers to “blog shifts,” when they would have to report on breaking news in the pop culture world and beat the News board at their own game. Our ambitious plans soon crumbled, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic changed the state of the world as we knew it.
Without the usual pop culture news cycle that we had anticipated (and also with our eyeballs glazing over in our heads), we had no choice but to adapt quickly and effectively. Plumbing the deepest recesses of our own niche interests and strained creativity, we came together once a week to deliver a series of article pitches so irresistibly compelling that roughly 10% of them were claimed by our adventurous cohort of writers. They wrote about everything from people drawing pictures of fruit on their Instagram stories to the dramatic resurgence of “Twilight”’s popularity. But, you may ask, what about the other 90%? How could the writing staff fail to take full advantage of the journalistic treasure trove at their disposal every week?
Well, to give you a little taste of what you might have missed out on this year, we will rank our top Arts Blog ideas that never saw the light of day.
Top 5 Birthday Parties
Pitched on President’s Day (which is, after all, a glorified birthday party), we hoped that this piece would encourage writers to search through the pop culture lexicon to find famous birthday parties, either from the real world or from art. Alas, writers simply showed no interest in giving this time-honored tradition the treatment it deserves. If you’re reading this vanity on your birthday, we apologize; maybe next year our writers will take you seriously.
Breakdown: Pitbull’s COVID-19 Anthem
On Apr. 13, renowned musician Pitbull released “I Believe That We Will Win (World Song),” a veritable masterpiece encouraging unity and perseverance as the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic. This song is an incredibly rich text just begging to be analyzed by an enterprising young writer, and yet as you might have guessed, no writer proved to be up to the challenge. How has the self proclaimed “Mr. Worldwide” coped with the decidedly not worldwide experience of lockdowns? We may never find out.
Arts Playlist: Zoom Romance
What began as an covert attempt to force somebody to write about Soulja Boy’s seminal classic “Kiss Me Thru the Phone” quickly morphed into a genuine request for a soundtrack to the experience of digital, socially-distanced romance.
Top 5 Leaps
Inspired by the Leap Day that fell on Feb. 29, 2020, we proposed that our writers pay homage to the act of leaping itself. When nobody appeared willing, we started brainstorming our own ideas, but found that ranking “leaps” demands a level of devotion and creativity that even we struggled to achieve. Our candidates included the moon landing (a “giant leap for mankind”), the scene in the 2002 Dreamworks movie “Spirit” where the horse protagonist jumps across a canyon, Drake and Future’s hit song “Jumpman,” and of course, the seminal 2010 holiday classic “Leap Day” starring Amy Adams. You’ll note that’s only four leaps. Perhaps in 2024 we will finally be ready to undertake this challenge and complete our list.
Theater Critic Power Rankings
When the esteemed New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley announced his retirement, we thought to ourselves, “okay!” Then it occurred to us that this was a breaking-news arts and culture item and that blog could easily expand its malleable purview to address it in some way. So we asked our adroit writers to rank the nation’s theater critics with alacrity and as much viciousness as was required. We then swiftly realized that we ourselves could not name more than one or two theater critics. An awkward silence ensued. Do as we say, not as we do!
Thinkpiece on Sitcom Casts Doing Political Fundraisers 
This wasn’t even that good of a pitch, but you couldn’t tell us that. For weeks on end, we screamed into the void: Why is every sitcom cast of the last twenty years doing a stilted and low-quality table read for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin? Clearly no one else was as baffled as we were despite our perseverance.
Ranking All 700+ “Glee” Performances
Sometimes, you just need to take journalism in your own hands. Beleaguered blog exec Amelia Roth-Dishy ‘22 has given up and claimed her own most passionate and masochistic pitch. The result is forthcoming.
— Outgoing Arts Blog Executives Connor S. Dowd and Amelia Roth-Dishy have used spite-fueled dark magic to create horcruxes out of all of these unclaimed pitches. They will remain immortal until somebody finally writes about Pitbull’s COVID-19 anthem, ranks every “Glee” performance, and participates in the discourse surrounding sitcom reunions masterminded by the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Contact them at connor.dowd@thecrimson.com and amelia.roth-dishy@thecrimson.com if you believe yourself up to the challenge of helping to destroy their souls piece by piece.

Well, 2020 didn’t end up being the year that I nor anybody else expected when it came to film. But here are four films about quarantine to watch in quarantine to soothe all your lockdown woes.
1. “12 Monkeys” (1995), dir. Terry Gilliam
Are you stuck at home because of a surging pandemic while simultaneously stuck on a GENED paper? If so, “12 Monkeys” might just be for you. Gilliam’s film is a mind-bending, time-traveling sci-fi thriller which takes place after a deadly virus wipes out most of humanity and the few remaining survivors take shelter underground. “12 Monkeys” features unhinged art direction, a crazy score, and over-the-top performances. In short, a visceral realization of your strangest lockdown fever dreams. It also engages in deep philosophical questions about free-will and the ethics of time travel (all four GENED categories: check).
2. “Rear Window” (1954), dir. Alfred Hitchcock
This Hitchcock mystery scores quarantine points because it follows a photographer (James Stewart) stuck in his apartment after breaking his leg. Armed with a pair of binoculars and copious amounts of curiosity, the investigative journalist becomes convinced that his neighbor is a murderer after observing him through his window. “Rear Window” is a funny, entertaining lockdown distraction — buoyed by the infectious chemistry between Stewart’s character and his socialite girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly).
3. “Parasite” (2019), dir. Bong Joon-ho
If you haven’t checked to see if someone is living in a secret basement under your house taking food from your refrigerator at night, quarantine might be a good time to finally do so. Bong Joon-ho’s biting social satire largely unfolds in one house, which itself acts as a plot device for burgeoning economic inequality. This spot could just as easily go to another Bong film — “The Host” — which features an actual pandemic, fake news, a monster caused by pollution, and discussions about colonialism.
4. “The Aviator” (2004), dir. Martin Scorsese
Are you a self-proclaimed businessman locked in your personal movie theater for months on end, urinating in milk bottles? If not, then congratulations! But if yes, you should (a) seek help and (b) check out “The Aviator” because it might be you on screen! “The Aviator” delivered on its promise of a great collaboration between Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, who played the obsessed, eccentric business magnate and aviator Howard Hughes. It explores themes of destructive ambition and crippling solitude — in other words, the tell-tale signs of a stereotypical Harvard student.
— So far under his reign, Lanz Aaron G. Tan has run a strict authoritarian regime which has seen the film section of The Crimson grow exponentially in power. He annexed the faux art form known as “T.V.” and rapidly expanded retrospective pieces to honor old cinema forgotten by college students. All jokes aside, Lanz is looking forward to another year as film executive, and contrary to popular belief, actually enjoys pop culture.

Hi, it’s me — Antoni Gaudí. You might know me from the cool Spanish architecture all over Barcelona. Palau Güell? Parque Güell? (He was my benefactor, chill. I had to name everything after him.) Casa Batllò? If you don’t know the names, just type “famous buildings made of mosaic” into Google Images and you’ll find a lot of poorly-Photoshopped images of my brainchildren.
I specifically designed most of my architectural masterpieces — they are masterpieces, obviously — to be made out of mosaic. I think the impression is super dope; the colors are vibrant, they reflect light gorgeously, and people can literally never stop taking pictures of them. They are also a pain in the ass to build, which is why, of course, I didn’t do it myself. I just watched, and believe me, it’s really hard being a genius. All that directing! Exhausting.
Anyway, if you do another search in Wikipedia, you’ll find that I also conceived of and directed the construction of La Sagrada Família (I’m still working on getting the name trademarked. Such logistics are really hard when you’re dead.) This cathedral is my magnum opus, the ne plus ultra of my career, the child I never had.
Infuriatingly, it is also still not finished, and I was extremely disturbed to find out that authorities halted construction this summer due to the “coronavirus pandemic.” They resumed in September, but the time delay between March and September of 2020 is, quite frankly, a disgrace that will only hinder my art from achieving its highest heights. I mean this literally, because the 452-foot tall tower dedicated to Virgin Mary is indeed very tall.
Look, I’m going to be straight with you. I died in 1926 after someone hit me with a tram, and I got subpar medical care because people thought I was a poor beggar who didn’t deserve to live. That was awful and cut short my illustrious career, but the bigger point is that I didn’t die of Spanish Flu about eight years earlier. Which means I’m a pretty big deal.
Back in my day, people were built different. If you died, you died, and if you didn’t — well, you might have known the queen, or some aristocrat, or had your own personal doctor, or possessed a very large, and very isolated, country home. There was none of this talk about “universal healthcare.” We literally just died, and that was super convenient for the wealthy ruling classes. Unlike now, we didn’t have to pretend to care about giving people rights to “healthcare” because that simply wasn’t something we thought about.
In any case, I’m pretty miffed that construction halted for the second time in history — last time, it was due to the Spanish Civil War, which was pretty dramatic. Much more dramatic than a pandemic, which didn’t stop us in 1918. People just kept on working, because that's just what you did.
I just really want to see it built, you know? I took over the project in 1883! They’ve been working for 137 years at this point, and I’ve been dead for 94 of them. Sure, people can still see the cathedral in most of its glory (although not now, apparently, given this “pandemic”), but it just isn’t the same. I want stained glass windows, I want majestic walkways, I want gently glimmering marble!
What’s that? You think that the outside looks like a castle made of wet dribbled sand? Good thing I’m dead — otherwise I’d make you hand-glue mosaic tile to an outdoor bench while I watch and smoke a cigar. All in a day’s work.
— Outgoing Books Exec Cassandra Luca ’21 says she’s looking forward to retirement, but will, in all honesty, be back next semester to review books and cause disgruntled feelings among the Crimson disqus commentariat (you know who). Secretly, she wonders if they’re doing okay and whether embroidery might be a better way for them to channel their bitterness. If you have thoughts about the opulent beauty of Gaudí’s architecture, she can be reached at cassandra.luca@thecrimson.com.

From classic literature like Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina” to the Safdie brothers’ “Uncut Gems,” self-destruction has long been a common artistic trope. Mike Figgis brings his directorial eye to this very theme in his romantic tragedy “Leaving Las Vegas” (1995). Based on the novel by John O’Brien, the film deftly explores the challenge of caring deeply for a person with devastating flaws. Through portraying the tension between the protagonists’ profound connection and persisting inner demons, Figgis artfully explores love, despair, and the capacity for — and, ultimately, futility of — change.
One of the film’s most notable cinematic elements is sound. During the opening credits, a man’s voiceover echoes against a black screen and foreshadows the self-destruction to come: “Have you ever had the feeling that you’re that close to losing your mind?” An ironically upbeat score accompanies a montage of Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) placing dozens of bottles of liquor into his shopping cart, an apt introduction to his alcoholism. Soon after his wife and son leave him, he gets fired from his job, leaving him destitute and adrift. Ben resolves to move to Las Vegas and reinvent himself. So he drives to Nevada alone, with a giant bottle of vodka clutched in his free hand.
Ben’s turbulence is mirrored by the profound unhappiness of Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a prostitute who acts as the film’s co-lead. Trapped in an abusive relationship with her manager Yuri (Julian Sands), she moves through life dissociated and disillusioned. Until she meets Ben, that is. Drunk and stumbling out of his car, he requests her services on the streets of Vegas. It quickly becomes clear, however, that Ben is more interested in companionship than sex. “You can have more money. You can drink all you want. Just stay,” he beseeches to a baffled Sera. “That’s what I want, I want you to talk or listen, just stay.” In the peaceful quiet of Ben’s hotel room, the two reflect on the winding drawbacks of their lives. Both individuals — plagued by solitude — are buoyed by their mutual connection.
Despite their uplifting bond, it becomes increasingly difficult to condone Ben’s incompetence. Their relationship is tragically asymmetrical: While Sera endures violence and abuse from customers to make money, Ben crashes for free on her sofa, drinking himself into a dreamy stupor. When Sera suggests a weekend getaway, he quickly accepts. Their vacation is ruined, however, when an inebriated Ben breaks a glass table by the pool. He commences to nonsensically scream, “I’m like a prickly pear!” before staggering, drunk, into their room. It is Sera who picks up broken glass from the concrete and is berated by an angry hotel owner who demands they evacuate the premises by morning. Ben eventually goes as far as to be intimate with a woman from a casino in Sera’s own bed — a momentous betrayal.
Perhaps Figgis's whole point, however, is the frustrating codependence of the protagonists. Ben extends companionship and kindness to Sera during her most vulnerable moments. In turn, Sera provides Ben the friendship he needs as he spirals into the clutches of alcoholism, depression, and existential despair. Both characters possess identities stigmatized by society. Through their bond, they humanize and uplift one another in a world that has all but turned its back to them.
Though every actor delivers a convincing performance, it is Shue who takes on the most emotionally demanding role — and executes it flawlessly. Deftly alternating between a steely exterior and flashes of violent emotion, Shue captures Sera’s simultaneous distrust of and intense desire for human connection. In a particularly memorable scene, Ben, detecting a hint of exasperation from Sera, suggests that he leave her home and relocate to a motel. Her strained expression reveals that she knows Ben is drinking himself to death. She looks up at him with tears in her eyes and responds, “And do what? Rot away in a room?” It is the nonchalance with which Sera utters these words over the dinner table that make them so deeply disturbing.
The most devastating aspect of the film is that Ben’s tragedy is sealed before he meets Sera. Nothing can reverse his belief that his life is not worth living, a conviction that extends the question: Was it even fair, then, for him to be with Sera? The film’s final image — a flashback to Ben grinning at Sera during their first encounter on the streets of Vegas — starkly juxtaposes the bleakness of the present. As the credits begin to role, one cannot help but trouble over the argument the film extends about the futility of change. Ultimately, Figgis seems to contend, no one can fight our darkest fears in our place.

A soft plucky guitar fills the speakers. After a moment, it’s replaced by a rush of wind, accompanied by birdsong. “Thanks for choosing to be here,” proclaims the screen. “Hold onto your butts.”
“Dragon Mama” opens on a set right out of Peter Brook’s wet dreams. On screen is a small square stage, lit around the edge by a string of white lights, and an armless chair. Get used to this barebones mise-en-scène and the woman standing on the chair, because that’s all you’re going to see for the next hour and 48 minutes of this new recording from the American Repertory Theater (ART).
That woman is Sara Porkalob, the creator and lead actress of this one-woman show. At the moment she is playing the youngest version of her mother, Maria Porkalob Jr., climbing a mango tree in search of the “juiciest ones.” Over the course of the show she transforms into nearly every Porkalob, from her grandmother, Maria Sr., to all four of her aunts and uncles at different ages, and finally to herself. Side characters are included by the dozen. Porkalob swings between them effortlessly, voice modulating and posture shifting to accommodate each new arrival.
One-woman shows are notoriously difficult to pull off effectively, especially in longform theater. From the beginning, Porkalob establishes a few simple rules: character-switching is accompanied by a slight turn of the body, scene-switching by a change of the lights, and any new character is an older version of Maria Jr. unless proven otherwise. There are no props — not even Maria Jr.’s signature Walkman. Porkalob allows herself only one break in character, which is to tell the audience about a moment in her family’s story that she “couldn’t quite figure out how to do in the rehearsal room.” Rather than wrench the viewer from the narrative, this beat serves instead as a reminder of Porkalob’s proximity to the events and of the essential and intimate truth of her portrayal.
Among the most persuasive moments are those that combine misfortune with hilarity. It is a peculiar combination, but it’s also one at which Porkalob excels. When a trailer park neighbor bullies the “baby of the family” Lily, her older sister Maria Jr. comes to the rescue, putting him in a headlock and letting Lily take her revenge in one of their more stomach-turning schemes. The soundtrack to the scene of Porkalob’s own birth is an a cappella rendition of Salt-N-Pepa’s “Push It,” with Maria Jr. yowling out the lyrics as a nurse tells her encouragingly to “push it… da da na-na-na.” Though her subject matter is serious, it never slips into tragedy, nor self-pity. Much of the power of “Dragon Mama” is Porkalob’s absolute certainty in the audience’s ability to empathize with her family.
With their mother often absent on unexplained trips to “Seaworld,” most scenes see her self-sufficient children conversing among themselves. The sunny, round-faced Porkalob plops easily into childhood, her voice pitching up to a squeaky burbling lisp. With cheerful naïveté she delivers lines like: “Sticks and stones might break my bones but you’re gonna die with no one to love you.” And though she differentiates cleverly between the various Porkalob children –– Lily has a pronounced lisp, Junior seems constantly to have a cold –– at times they can muddle together.
But the real pitfalls come near the end, when the average viewer is tiring from both the unavoidable monotony of the one-woman format and the brutally sincere subject matter. After Maria Jr.’s move to Alaska, which remains fairly perplexing up until the very end of the show, she meets the karaoke connoisseur Tina at an Anchorage gay club. Tina and Maria Jr.’s relationship edges dangerously close to a mentor-mentee dynamic, and is at best one-sided, making it difficult to hold out hope for them staying together. The last 20 minutes drag on in a way the rest does not, as Porkalob leans too heavily on an overripe timbre for comic relief. But overwhelmingly her performance is clever, genuine, and charming.
“Dragon Mama,” streaming on the ART website through Dec. 10, is the second installment of Porkalob’s three-play “Dragon Cycle.” The first, “Dragon Lady,” opened at the OBERON in 2018, and told the story of Maria Porkalob Sr.’s gangster past; the last, “Dragon Baby,” will follow Porkalob herself if the generational pattern holds, and will premiere at the ART at some point in the future. If it is anything like “Dragon Mama,” it will be a show worth looking out for.

Gabriel S. Fox-Peck ‘20 (off cycle) displayed his senior thesis during the fall of 2019 in the form of a concert; The concert, titled “Glorybound,” has recently been released as an album. Fox-Peck was nominated for “Best Original Song” at the 2020 Golden Globes and 2020 Academy Awards for the song “Stand Up” from Harriet. The Harvard Crimson had the opportunity to speak with Fox-Peck.
The Harvard Crimson: For starters, how does it feel, now that your album is being released? What are you most excited about?
Gabriel S. Fox-Peck: I’m just so excited that we can finally listen to it and everyone that wasn’t able to go is going to be able to hear it ... I was telling the rest of the choir, I also edited the video for it, which is on YouTube, and I was getting chills while editing it because it was still so palpable to me. I’m very excited for my grandparents to listen to it. I’m just excited to share it with the world.
THC: Can you talk about where the idea for the project began and how it’s developed into the album being released today?
GSF: I studied religion — that was my concentration — but for a long time I have been really moved by gospel music. I went to church growing up, but it was a white church and the music was not anything like what we did. And then I left that church as soon as my parents stopped making me go. I tried going to a Buddhist temple for a while; I was just very spiritually interested in different cultures and that’s part of why I studied Comparative Religion. But then I eventually levitated back to Christianity and was listening to gospel recordings on my own, just going through a YouTube hole of finding these incredible recordings of some of the most talented musicians and moving songs I’ve ever heard. So that led me to conceive of this project that would combine my research interests with my performance interests, essentially. I did a whole extensive research project where I went to Chicago and went to these old archives with some of the first churches where gospel was performed and looked at these particular figures, Thomas A Dorsey and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, that I thought were really impactful in the way that they crossed the bridge between secular and sacred music. As part of my research, I was able to go to the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses, which is held every year in Detroit, and that was probably the most formative moment, just seeing it all in practice. I was able to bring an artist that I met there to Harvard to perform as well. It was a long, winding trail, and all these forces and people were able to come together for this one super special day, which was the only day that everyone was in the same room. It still feels very surreal.
THC: When did you decide to turn it into an album?
GSF: I wanted it to be audio and video recorded and to have something to show for it, but I didn’t have any intention of releasing it on streaming platforms until a few weeks and months afterward AND we were still really connected to the music. I would wake up singing some of the songs in my head from it, and I wasn’t the only person in the choir that felt that way. I think that kind of pushed us to be like ‘why don’t we just take it there?’
THC: What would you say “Glorybound” aims to say?
GSF: I think, at a certain level, it’s a story of redemption and hope and a desire to make the world better and a faith in God. That is really the essence of gospel music, spreading the good word. Gospel literally means the good word. But I think there are some other really important meanings, one of which is reexamining the expectations of Harvard, especially surrounding race and this association of Harvard with a predominantly white institution. You don’t usually associate gospel or soulful music with Harvard University, and that’s a really important part of it for me too. I was blown away by how many incredible black musicians were at Harvard alone. Bringing that side of Harvard to life is another important part of this project.
THC: If you had to pick, where would you say you drew the most inspiration from for the album?
GSF: Very directly it’s from the people who I studied, Thomas Dorsey and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. It was nice to have your thesis content to be music that is very soothing. When I would get fed up with writing and thinking of structural framework [and] have these hyper-intellectual words in my head, I would literally listen to a song by Thomas Dorsey and think ‘this is why I’m doing this.’ Secondly, from the incredible musicians that were [in the performance].
THC: How do you seek out opportunities since being out of school? Do you have any advice for recent graduates specifically in the music field?
GSF: I think being an open human is very important and not being afraid to collaborate with others. There’s a lot of perfectionism, especially amongst artists, especially amongst Harvard artists. That can really get in your way. First of all, it’s not going to ever be perfect. I was constantly building a network of people that I knew did this professionally. Once I got out [of school], I sort of leaned on that and took initiative on my own things. Sometimes you just need to do you until someone notices. Thankfully I’ve gotten really lucky on certain things. Also failing is an important thing that a lot of Harvard students do not do gracefully. It’s not going to be easy and people don’t care if you have a Harvard degree in the art world. It’s scary but it’s so worth it. If anyone’s considering it, just try it. It’s so worth it if it works. And if not you can always go back to school or get another job...Just shoot your shot.

“Wonder Woman,” the first female-lead superhero film in a decade and the first such film directed by a woman, exceeds expectations of the tried and true superhero origin story by bringing artful visuals, incredible action, compelling characters, and a moving storyline to the big screen. With the release of “Wonder Woman 1984” on Christmas Day 2020, the first solo installment to Diana’s story is well worth a revisit.
Aesthetically speaking, this is a beautifully stylized film. Cinematographer Matthew Jensen uses distinct color palettes to denote different time periods and locations. For example, when viewers are whisked away to Wonder Woman’s mystical home of Themyscira, the screen is filled with brilliant shades of vibrant greens and rich golds. This is contrasted with a moody palette of hazy blues when Diana leaves her homeland for the mortal world of war-torn 1910s Europe. These colors also serve as powerful contrast to the effectively used flashes of orange during the film's climax when the sun rises over Diana's final victory over Ares.
In addition to the film's striking color choices, the production and costume design are equally incredible. Each set felt well developed, regardless whether it was wholly fictional or historically based, and there were plenty of design easter eggs throughout the film. Additionally, the costumes were highly commendable. The costumes for the Amazons were a solid mix between practical and elegant (unlike the overtly sexualized versions of the Amazon’s costumes in “Justice League”). Diana’s costumes in particular really worked to embody her poise and power, and these visuals were a much needed break from the male gaze perpetuated in many superhero movies. Her costumes brought the motifs of Wonder Woman’s traditional costume, with navy blue, crimson, and golden bronze as primary colors, and gave them an updated look without sacrificing viability — her armor looks like actual armor that gives some protection, rather than just serving for visual enjoyment.
Though the aesthetics of the film made for an experience full of wonder, the movie is itself spectacular because of its well-written characters and storyline. Gal Gadot gives a standout performance as Diana. Balancing the grace, love, and ferocity that Wonder Woman is known for, Gadot gave such a passionate performance that it’s nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Her co-star, Chris Pine, also gave his all as Captain Steve Trevor; he's lovable to a fault, and boasts electric chemistry with Gadot along with his ability to nail both moments of humor and moments of sorrow. Gadot’s and Pine’s performances were bolstered by the immense talent of the supporting cast, as well as by the striking acting of the film’s villain Ares, played by David Thewlis. Thewlis brought a deep-set sinisterness to his antagonist: He was the kind of villain that could convince you he was anything but. Thewlis’s Ares was impressively juxtaposed with Gadot’s perseverant optimism.
The many fight scenes are excellently choreographed. It is absolutely enthralling to see the impressive fighting skills of Diana, and each fight has purpose and adds something to the movie. There is no gratuitous violence for the sake of gritty aesthetics, which has been a feature of some DC Comics movies past. Though slow motion in these scenes is overused, it does find its place when Diana crosses No Man’s Land in the film's most poignant sequence.
Lastly, these classic elements of a good origin story are supported by an iconic score. The music is memorable and energizing. It doesn’t distract from the events of the movie, but rather amplifies them and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The repeating motif found in the Wonder Woman theme as she charges into battle is particularly empowering and exciting in the scope of the film’s soundtrack.
"Wonder Woman" is a brilliant example of what a superhero movie should be. There’s a stellar combination of drama, dialogue, and action. The stakes are high, with the world at war and Diana's quest to defeat Ares. Though the dialogue can be cheesy and sometimes dwell into the realm of slapstick humor, the audience remains compelled and entertained throughout. Though it is a superhero story, the core values this film pushes to the forefront are, at their core, refreshingly realistic. Diana comes to realize that the human world is full of complexities, and the duality of human nature means that every person holds the capacity for both great good as well as great evil. Diana does not fight for the world because she thinks it is perfect, nor because she thinks the problems of the world are solvable by a single hero. Instead, she stays to fight for love and for the just world she knows can exist. This message was powerful upon the film’s 2017 release, and it’s just as necessary of a message today.

Theater thrives on physical proximity. What happens, then, when a global pandemic makes in-person performances impossible?
Since its establishment in 1975, Steppenwolf Theatre has become a hub of culture and arts in the Windy City, expanding to boast an impressive list of accolades including twelve Tony Awards and the National Medal of Arts.
In 2016, Steppenwolf embarked on an ambitious $73 million campus expansion that began with the opening of a new theater on 1700 N Halsted Street in Chicago. In a March 5, 2019 press release, the company confirmed its plans to open a 50,000 square foot building in the summer of 2021. The new complex will include, among other features, a 400-seat in-the-round theater, a “dedicated education floor,” and an atrium lobby, according to the March press release.
Steppenwolf’s physical presence, however, is not the only feature of the company undergoing profound changes during the pandemic. In an interview with The Crimson, Associate Artistic Director Leelai Demoz and Production Stage Manager Laura D. Glenn discussed the launch of Steppenwolf NOW, a wave of online programming that “offers a dynamic and innovative slate of immersive and visual experiences, radio plays, bite-sized programming, and episodic work,” according to the company’s website.
Demoz, who operated his own production company in Los Angeles before joining Steppenwolf in 2019, said collaboration, spontaneity, and a conviction to uplift performers struggling during the pandemic were essential to crafting engaging digital content.
“A lot of times, if you’re making a low-budget film, you just start. You know what you want to do, you know the ‘why’ you want to do it, you don’t necessarily know the ‘how.’ And in a lot of ways, this is what we did,” Demoz said.
“We want to work with the artists, the playwrights whose shows got cancelled. We started with that as the first initial path,” he added.
Many of the directors who participated in Steppenwolf NOW had written plays that were slated to run with the company but were postponed due to COVID-19, according to Demoz. Playwright James Ijames and director Whitney White — who collaborated on the 20-minute filmed play “What is Left, Burns” that details the renewed connection between two poets and former lovers — had originally joined forces for a play postponed until the 2021-22 production season.
“It really was a conversation and a dialogue: ‘Are you interested? Can you do this? We have a really short timeline. It’s not like when you write a play, it’s not in a year and a half from now. It’s, like, in a few months from now.’ So it was a very dynamic process that we’re still in the middle of, because we’re producing and editing,” he said.
Glenn, who joined Steppenwolf as an intern in 1988, has worked on a number of audio-only radio plays and filmed plays during the pandemic, including Ijames’ “What is Left, Burns.” Glenn said multiple technologies were used to create an immersive digital experience.
“For ‘What is Left, Burns,’ again, Zoom was the facilitator, but not the recording aspect of it. We used that so we could have a conversation, so we could try different things, so that everyone could speak — or not speak, as the case may be — but we were actually recording it through QuickTime, through iPhones, using other mediums to actually capture content,” she said.
Glenn underscored the challenges of being involved in the theater industry during the pandemic.
“It is a very terrifying time to be someone who just makes your living in live theater,” Glenn said. “It’s still, unfortunately, going to be a little bit of time before it’s safe for us to be in the theaters and people will feel safe to come back to the theater. I hope that this keeps people’s appetite for it alive.”
Demoz hopes Steppenwolf NOW will provide audiences with a chance to simulate the unique intimacy of live theater.
“The great thing about live theater is that you’re trapped in a room with other people, experiencing something at the same time. That’s really hard to replicate. But we hope that feeling of pausing and listening — without the ability to move forward and backward — and just being there has value for our audience and our members,” he said.
Artistic Director Anna D. Shapiro emphasized in an email the importance of connection and artistic engagement during the ongoing pandemic.
“Steppenwolf has discovered new innovative ways of storytelling and community building that will continue long after we’re back on the stage. One of the things that can be hard about theatre is how few people it can reach, yet in this moment of isolation, theatre makers are embracing the opportunity to connect,” she wrote.
With a $75 virtual membership, individuals can access the complete collection of Steppenwolf NOW’s digital offerings. The two-act radio play “Wally World” began streaming on December 16. Plays including “Red Folder,” “Duchess! Duchess! Duchess!,” “Where We Stand,” and “Ages of the Moon” will stream via Steppenwolf NOW in the months to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many other ballet companies who have been forced offstage, Boston Ballet is presenting an entirely digital season this fall. Titled “BB@yourhome,” the season opened on Nov. 19 with “Forsythe Elements,” a tribute to the company’s long standing partnership with the inimitable choreographer William Forsythe. This first installment of “BB@yourhome” provides a deep dive into Forsythe’s works, with excerpts from a wide range of pieces including “Playlist (EP),” “Pas/Parts 2018,” “The Second Detail,” “Artifact 2017,” “Blake Works I,” and “In the Middle Somewhat Elevated.” With clips from the Boston Ballet’s archives of past live performances, a Zoom conversation between Forsythe and six company dancers, and a few excerpts filmed in November, this program offers both beautiful performance footage of the incredible Boston Ballet dancers and an intimate, behind-the-scenes glimpse at Forsythe’s working process.
For viewers who were looking for a semblance of a night at the ballet, they may be disappointed. “Forsythe Elements” plays out more like a documentary —a sort of highlight reel of the choreographer’s pieces. Though viewers are treated to a wide sampling of Forsythe’s works, the clips are rather short, with no single work shown from start to finish, so there is never quite time to get sucked into the magic of the piece or story. Despite being rather less satisfying than seeing a full length production in person, this may actually be a rather smart way to attack online production — as people tend to have much shorter attention spans for online work.
Still, the presentation format doesn’t detract from the excitement and energy of Forysthe’s choreography, performed with great finesse by the Boston Ballet dancers. Particularly impressive is the control and musicality;so much of Forsythe is exceedingly technically challenging — and fast. The dancers attacked the movement with great virtuosity and tempo, yet still created lovely pockets of stillness — photo moments — holding a position or slowing down a movement to great effect. “Blake Works I” highlighted Forsythe’s brilliantly unique manipulation of elements of classical ballet, here through his use of a traditional corps de ballet that created wonderfully interesting visuals with high port de bras swung through in perfect unison by the dancers.
The program opened with a performance of “Playlist (EP) Impossible” and “Pas/Parts 2018,” filmed in-studio during the pandemic. The work featured COVID-safe performances, with dancers filmed in individual videos that were edited together in post-production to create duets and trios. This, too, was a testament to the dancers’ impressive musicality, as they danced perfectly “together” in their separate boxes on screen — something that is much easier to do when physically beside each other. The dancers also wore masks, something audiences have likely gotten used to (and are unquestionably necessary for safety). Still, it was disappointing to not be able to see the dancers’ faces — especially as the particular advantage of videography over live performance is the added intimacy and closeness that reveals facial expression, emotion, and artistry far more clearly.
The longest segment of the program, and, in fact, the highlight of it, was a recorded Zoom conversation between Forsythe himself and six company dancers: Lia Cirio, Chrystyn Fentroy, John Lam, Lawrence Rines, Haley Schwan, and Patrick Yocum. The group covered many topics, from what it’s been like working through the pandemic to what the choreographic and setting (of a previously choreographed piece onto new dancers) process looks like with Forsythe. The dancers all spoke warmly of their experiences working with Forsythe, calling it a truly collaborative process, as he works with each individual to allow them to “live their truth onstage,” as dancer Haley Schwan put it. With the intimacy of Zoom, this conversation provided a lovely behind the scenes look at this choreographic process, and a glimpse of what clearly seemed to be a wonderful relationship.
For lovers of Forsythe, “Forsythe Elements” provides an excellent look at his works, along with the partnership between the choreographer and Boston Ballet. Although it often felt more like a highlight reel than a cohesive performance, this was a truly unique digital work perhaps better suited for an online audience likely less invested than a theater audience. The program fully showcased the amazing repertoire of Boston Ballet’s work with Forsythe, proving once again the virtuosity of Boston Ballet’s dancers, and marking a promising start to “BB@yourhome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the age of coronavirus, making connections is difficult — especially for freshmen. Whether you’re on-campus, off-campus, or international, social opportunities are sparse, and — in a world dominated by Zoom — often feel manufactured. A freshman podcast, “Dear Harvard Confessions,” is aiming to ameliorate the situation in a creative way.
Run by co-hosts Elizabeth I. Ogolo ‘24, Brandon L. Kingdollar ‘24 and Muriel M. Dol ‘24, the podcast came together thanks to a GroupMe advertisement from another Harvard podcast: “Quarantined at Harvard.”
“It went from a GroupMe idea to real life,” Ogolo said.
“Dear Harvard Confessions” features confessions sent in by fellow Harvard freshmen which are then discussed by Ogolo, Kingdollar, and Dol, who share their own experiences and offer advice.
“I feel like freshman year is definitely a hard time for a lot of students, and everybody at Harvard definitely has this ‘game face’ complex going on where we’re like ‘Oh yeah, everything’s fine.’ So [we] just really wanted to create a platform where students could ask for advice,” Dol said.
“Obviously we’re telling other people’s stories but we’re putting our own personal flavor into it.” Kingdollar said. “I try to include personal experiences of mine whenever I can — not because I’m some giant narcissist but because I feel like it helps listeners connect to us and, by extension, the people who are sending in their confessions.”
“Dear Harvard Confessions” also aims to reflect some of the feelings of the freshman community.
“We’ve gotten lots of submissions and they’ve been funny, they’ve been deep, some have been all over the place. And it’s been really fun to dissect a confession, dissect something that someone’s been asking for help on, and be able to provide that. So I was really excited about the chance to do that, and after actually being in the podcast and actually being able to do what I thought I would be excited for — it’s been even better,” Ogolo said.
Dol added that they hope the podcast can be a positive influence and a fresh take on the familiar concept of college students anonymously airing dirty laundry.
“I feel like there’s so many confession pages where it’s all negative stuff, or people will use it to get into drama on campus, and [we] wanted to do something different where we’re putting out positivity and helping people out.”
In addition to providing struggling fellow students with support, Ogolo, Kingdollar, and Dol are hoping “Dear Harvard Confessions” can provide students with connections and a sense of community.
“I’m most excited for hearing the true thoughts and feelings of individuals at Harvard, and letting people get a window into the lives of their fellow students,” Kingdollar said.
“We thought ‘Why not give us, like first years as a whole, an opportunity to just talk about the things that bother them, talk about the things that interest them or anything that could’ve happened on campus?’” Ogolo said.
“And just sharing that you’re not alone,” Dol added.
