BLACKPINK thrives on contradiction. The band’s name itself mashes together two colors that feel like opposites, symbolic of the multiplicities of their artistic personas. At once innocent and forward, vulnerable and swaggering, Rosé, Lisa, Jennie, and Jisoo are at their best when they engage the liminal space between binaries reflective of cultural productions of femininity.
Since their debut in 2016, BLACKPINK has pushed the envelope for female artists in the K-pop space. In an industry where female artists are commonly hypersexualized or presented reductively to pander to the male gaze, the quartet has proved that female artists can reach the top on their own terms.
The music video for “How You Like That” — complete with winged chandeliers, bejeweled outfits, and a wooden Trojan horse — demonstrated the group’s unapologetic brazenness, a quality generally reserved for male artists in the industry. The track also furthered the quartet’s reliance on visual appeal, rather than musical talent, to promote projects. “Ice Cream with Selena Gomez” provided much of the same, exacerbating reservations about BLACKPINK’s — and YG Entertainment’s — tendency to pair recycled beats with garish spectacles when crafting hit tracks.
“The Album,” BLACKPINK’s first full-length studio album, was released on Oct. 2 through YG Entertainment and Interscope. Yet another music video accompanied the release, this time for “Lovesick Girls”: The video’s aesthetics vacillate between pink-hued, innocent femininity and wrecked cars, screaming matches, and urban nightscapes, symbolic of a transition to a disillusioned outlook on the tenuous viability of romance. Though it draws heavily on common tropes, the video succeeds in conveying a layered statement on female-driven love — or the lack thereof — through stunning visuals and ambitious set pieces.
“The Album” shines brightest when the quartet trades their synthetic bubble-gum shimmer for nuanced vulnerability and a tongue-in-cheek subversion of their plastic vapidity. The understated, sonically unconventional later songs like “Love to Hate Me” and “You Never Know” try on a fresh sound while meditating on the tensions between the private and the public, between feeling deeply vulnerable and smugly invincible.
What is notable about “The Album” is its occasional departure from the group’s lyrical tendency to use an unnamed male figure as a proxy for romantic aspirations and, in a more abstract sense, their engagement with the public at large. In previous hits including “Forever Young,” “Whistle,” “Don’t Know What To Do,” and “Boombayah,” the group employs a male love interest as a means of accentuating their feminine vulnerability and emotional impulses.
Though flirtatious tracks including “Bet You Wanna” featuring Cardi B, “Lovesick Girls,” and “Crazy Over You” loosely conform to this trend, the subtly vindictive “Love to Hate Me” and emotionally forward “You Never Know” seem to address members of the public directly with their confessional lyrics and thoughtful explications of the pressures of a life under starlit scrutiny. Through both tracks, BLACKPINK addresses haters as opposed to hypothetical lovers: The songs center not imagined feminine personas, but the real people behind them.
In the ballad-like “You Never Know,” stripped vocals pair with orchestral violin to provide an atmospheric, incisive meditation on fame. During the chorus Rosé and Jisoo exclaim, “But you’ll never know unless you walk in my shoes / You’ll never know, my tangled strings / ‘Cause everybody sees what they wanna see / It’s easier to judge me than to believe.” Their candid reflections display the disconnect between their interior complexities and their simplified public personas.
In a similar vein of vulnerability, “Love to Hate Me” employs the second-person “you” as a metonymic stand-in for their haters: “Kinda sad that you always been like that,” croons Rosé, “See me making waves and you don’t like that.” The song’s introspective and confrontational nature lends to the album an emotional intimacy that, though somewhat packaged, pushes the boundaries of the musical act’s lyrical potential.
Other tracks, however, end up conforming to the formula established by the group’s previous discography. The jarring braggadocio of “How You Like That” is uncannily reminiscent of the chorus of the trap-influenced “DDU-DU DDU-DU” remix in their second mini-album “Kill This Love.” The sassy rhythmic beat of “Pretty Savage” and the alluring, gently psychedelic trills of “Crazy Over You” recall the disenchanted glamour of “Kick It.” “Lovesick Girls” — which possesses an undeniably catchy if somewhat juvenile chorus — flirts with aesthetic and lyrical authenticity but ultimately falls flat, eluding the achievement of a new idea.
In particular, the album’s hit tracks that merited music videos — “How You Like That,” “Ice Cream,” and “Lovesick Girls” — fail to present a novel or thoughtfully dimensionalized iteration of the quartet’s artistic image. BLACKPINK, however, has never scrambled for reinvention: Their current hybrid of flirtatious and naive, hopelessly romantic and cooly disillusioned, sugary and brash has filled a niche in the K-pop industry and catapulted them to global heights.
Perhaps future albums will present opportunities for the group’s repurposing of tropes for the creation of more nuanced artistic arguments. At the end of the day, though, the music is still catchy and the girls are gorgeous: Deservingly, their army of fans (“Blinks”) will likely gush about the album’s merits for months to come.

On “Shore,” the fourth album from Fleet Foxes, lead singer and songwriter Robin Pecknold harks back to the band’s roots. With a newfound lyrical focus and compositional maturity, Pecknold avoids a derivative remixing of old material to create a joyous work replete with warmth and gratitude.
The album is an easy listen — especially when measured against the band’s 2017 album “Crack-Up,” which featured avante-garde experimentation and a nine-minute lead single. Perhaps his most fun project to date, “Shore” is the musical equivalent of Pecknold letting his hair down. Despite the decidedly lighter tone, the album maintains a profound lyrical depth that combines with lush instrumentation to conjure memories of the band’s pre “Crack-Up” era.
Much of “Shore” exists in the same sonic neighborhood as Fleet Foxes’s 2008 debut album and 2011’s “Helplessness Blues.” Exposed acoustic guitar riffs and more predictable rhythms signal a return to the mountain-rock style of the band’s earlier work and a shift away from the harmonic experimentalism and syncopation found on “Crack-Up.” The decidedly straightforward structure of many of “Shore”’s tracks lends itself to sing-along melodies much like the early hits that helped get Fleet Foxes noticed on Myspace. Stacked vocal harmonies on “Can I Believe You” echo the campfire style of “White Winter Hymnal” and “Ragged Wood.” Likewise, the folk ballad “I’m Not My Season” recalls the melodic qualities of “Someone You’d Admire” and “Blue Spotted Tail” on “Helplessness Blues.”
In returning to old ideas, Pecknold successfully toes the line between repeating and revamping. The complex arrangements on many of “Shore”’s songs highlight his development and experience as a songwriter. The album’s sixth track, “A Long Way Past the Past,” evokes the catchiness of “Fleet Foxes” with soaring vocal harmonies and guitar strumming, but adds additional components: electric bass, drums, and a brass section. The full-bodied instrumentation on “A Long Way Past the Past” and subsequent tracks like “Going-to-the-Sun Road” gives “Shore” maturity compared with the thin guitar accompaniments on much of “Fleet Foxes” and “Helplessness Blues.” Coupled with its catchy tunes, the compositional richness of “Shore” makes the album one to listen to on repeat.
While building on the strengths of his earlier work, “Shore” leaves little room for Pecknold to expand the scope of the “Fleet Foxes” canon. Unlike the meticulously crafted about-face on “Crack-Up” and even the vocal experimentations on “Helplessness Blues,” “Shore” breaks with Pecknold’s tradition. A readily-accessible song length and pacing perhaps signals a desire to attract new listeners while recapturing old fans who may have been turned off by the experimentation on “Crack-Up.” Indeed, the release of “Shore” coincided with a label change by Fleet Foxes from Nonesuch Records, which published “Crack-Up,” to ANTI- Records, home of folk legend Tom Waits. On “Shore,” Pecknold is successful in his retrospective compositional approach, but it is disappointing that he didn’t take more risks with his songwriting.
Shore’s songwriting may not be anything new, but the album’s lyricism holds up among the best in the Fleet Foxes catalogue. Where “Helplessness Blues,” explored loss and sorrow, “Shore” is Pecknold’s expression of thanks. On the same day as the album release, the band posted a list of “Thank Yous” on their Instagram addressed to project contributors and sources of inspiration. The list includes deceased songwriters Richard Swift, Bill Withers and John Prine. The opening line of the second track “Sunblind” mentions these artists by name: “For Richard Swift / For John and Bill.” “For every gift lifted far before its will,” Pecknold continues. It’s a heavy subject. And yet, through his warm, layered instrumentation, Pecknold avoids cliche melancholic tropes, instead expressing his gratitude as a humble student of those who came before him: “in your rarified air I feel sunblind.” The result is cathartic and uplifting, making “Sunblind” the standout track on the album.
On subsequent tracks, Pecknold continues to inspire with hopeful words that meet the current moment head-on with a refreshing optimism. Largely written and recorded during quarantine, “Shore” is a treatise on self confidence and a reminder to be grateful for the beauty in one’s life. On “A Long Way Past the Past,” Pecknold sings “Oh man, was it much better then? / We were left alone / We were proud of our pain.” Pecknold’s lyrics speak of wisdom and hope that, particularly when paired with his instrumentation, is incredibly moving. On “Going-to-the-Sun Road,” he sings: “If I want to, I’ll arrive at peace / I know I decide what I remember.”
Oddly enough, with shows cancelled and music venues closed, Pecknold could not have chosen a better time to release his album. His self-assured lyrics and triumphant return to basics are a culmination of Fleet Foxes’s thirteen year career. “Shore” sees Pecknold in full artistic command of his craft, an achievement worthy of comparison to the work of Pecknold’s inspirations on “Sunblind.”

Achieving utopia is hard. The original 2013 British TV show “Utopia” was cancelled after just two seasons, despite somewhat of a cult following. HBO struggled to acquire the rights for an American version of the dark comedy thriller, but it was Amazon who ultimately ended up with them in April 2018. With Gillian Flynn (“Gone Girl,” “Sharp Objects”) as writer and showrunner, the American remake of “Utopia” has finally arrived, and it is bound to attract fans both old and new. The series premiere sets up a mysterious high-stakes story that doesn’t hook you right off the bat, but a mix of confusion and curiosity may be enough to get audiences to episode two.
Episode one — called “Life Begins” — introduces audiences to a group of online conspiracy theorists who think that a comic book called “Dystopia“ is more than just fiction. They believe that the mysterious text has predicted world shaking events — notably terrible viruses like Ebola and Zika. When someone accidentally discovers “Dystopia”’s sequel, “Utopia,” and decides to sell it at a comic book convention, the group meets in person to try and acquire it. At the convention, there are, of course, fans who laugh at them for their fanaticism, but there are also some willing to kill to get their hands on the “Utopia” manuscript.
Many close-up shots on the titular comic book reveal cannibalism, gore, and evil rabbits (very scary). Episode one includes a decent amount of violence. Notably, there are two sequences in which large groups of innocent people are murdered one by one. Multiple characters are shot point blank in the face, and audiences get a different perspective of each murder: head on, from behind, even through a splattering of blood on a reflective plate cover. Despite being unnecessarily graphic at times, these killings are effective in creatively communicating the show’s high stakes: These antagonists aren’t playing around.
The show’s protagonists, on the other hand, are not nearly as eerie. We meet them as they geek out to each other over the discovery of the “Utopia’ comic, in a sequence where viewers see them in split-screen alongside their text messages. With very little spoken dialogue, this intro gives a well-edited albeit cursory look at the main characters. It isn’t yet clear why they want “Utopia” so badly, or how they came together in the first place, but this episode does succeed in establishing a team of people who’ve gotten involved in something much bigger than they realize. Notably absent from this episode was the character Michael Stearns, played by Rainn Wilson (“The Office”). Wilson’s prominent role in the series’s trailer was very exciting to many fans, who will likely be disappointed by his absence in episode one.
The opening credits for this first episode are jarringly reminiscent of the news: a montage of environmental disasters, police holding back protesters, and viruses in petri dishes. The comic book “Utopia” is said to be able to predict deadly viruses, and, in heavy-handed foreshadowing, news reports of a mysterious flu are heard in the background throughout the entire episode. Obviously, audiences’ minds will likely immediately jump to COVID-19, even though the show — whose filming was already complete by the fall of 2019 — could not have intended for this parallel. This thriller TV series is sure to dramatize the experience of a pandemic, an occurrence that was once far removed from “real life.” For audiences sick of living through a pandemic and turning to TV for some escapism, this may hit a little too close to home.
Are the events of “Utopia” actually real, or just a conspiracy? Who is pulling the strings behind the scenes? Despite its imperfect beginning, if it ramps up its character development and maintains the intrigue and suspense, “Utopia” will keep many viewers enthralled in its remaining episodes.
All eight episodes of “Utopia” Season One are now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.

“Ghosts of Harvard” initially portrays itself as a coming of age mystery: An anxious Harvard freshman with a complicated family background wants to discover the secrets behind her brother’s death. The title even hints at the supernatural activity, but what makes “Ghosts of Harvard” worth the read is its avoidance of thriller tropes. Instead of instilling fear, the ghosts provide sources of solace and aid for the narrator. More broadly, they drive home the extended theme of time and its role in examining who gets remembered and why. These themes are initially unapparent, but throughout a mildly slow yet enjoyable read, they leave the audience with a fresh take on the world before them, and the world of Harvard.
The novel opens with narrator Cady Archer on her move-in day at Harvard. Cady plans to uncover what happened to her brother Eric, a former student at the same college with schizophrenia who ultimately committed suicide. On her first day of classes, Cady begins hearing voices in her head that reveal themselves to be Harvard inhabitants from years past. These voices help Cady in her classes and guide her away from boys at parties, but they also relay their own lives and aid Cady in uncovering the truth behind her brother’s death. The question remains — are these ghosts really there to help, or a sign that Cady should never have come to Harvard at all?
The author and narrator of “Ghosts of Harvard” each have a unique relationship to the novel’s setting. As a narrator, Cady is very disconnected to the world around her — she attends Harvard intending to see it from Eric’s eyes. Although Cady’s social disconnect can be frustrating throughout the story, the world of a Harvard freshman comes to life through author Francesca Serritella’s personal experience. Serritella attended Harvard, a fact that comes alive through her descriptions of Harvard lingo — Cady takes a trip to “the stacks,” the rows of books beneath Widener Library, and to a final club, the elitist Harvard equivalent of a fraternity or similar social organization. Beyond informative anecdotes, Serritella portrays the awe-inspiring side of attending the College. Cady writes: “Harvard was more than a school. It was validation. It was history. It was expectation. The place crackled with potential energy.” Serritella’s connection to Harvard allows the reader to experience the school for the first time alongside Cady.
The title focuses on the past for a reason: The treasures of “Ghosts of Harvard’’are the lessons gleaned from the history that are masterfully woven into the storyline. Serritella’s own Harvard experience does not stop her from performing extensive research for her debut novel, and when Cady speaks to the ghosts, this attention to detail is obvious.
Of the three ghosts, two were real people and the third is fictional but historically accurate. The first reveals itself a famous Harvard graduate whose conversations with Cady are heavily based on his own letters. The other ghost is Bilhah, a real person who was enslaved at Harvard. Bilhah comes alive in the pages of “Ghosts of Harvard,” so much so that her storyline is just as gripping as Cady’s. Other writing on Bilhah and the other people enslaved at Harvard is scarce, and Serritella justifies her inclusion of Bilhah with a quote by Harvard’s previous president, Drew Faust: “We name the names to remember these stolen lives.”
Serritella’s experimentation with the concept of time is wonderful in a literary sense, but also drives home a question that transcends the plot of the novel: How does history decide who gets remembered, and what power do we have today to remember those who were forgotten? The novel is not the mysterious thriller it is portrayed to be, and this is where the novel’s strengths lie. The plot development dawdles until its culmination, making it impossible to put down. Cady’s conversations with the ghosts can be seen as detracting from the story’s development, particularly at first: Some are drawn out and simply remove Cady from the world around her.
Cady reflects that, with complete control, “love wouldn’t be a gift. This was the uncertainty of life, and of death. It was what made life beautiful and terrifying at once. It was the state of grace.” “Ghosts of Harvard” is worth the read for its conclusion alone, but there is more to draw from the story than its beautiful tale of self-discovery. It highlights the importance of controlling the controllables, and the real ability to shape the legacy we leave.

“F*ckface” is an attention-grabbing title, and the twelve short stories within hold that attention. In this debut collection, Leah Hampton delivers wonderfully rounded portraits of a varied group of characters. Through all these different individuals’ eyes, she masterfully depicts the unique stresses and pleasures of life in rural Appalachia. It’s clearly a place she knows well, and it comes through in her beautiful descriptions of the land and the adept ways in which slang, character names, or descriptions of kudzu subtly transport the reader to the rural South.
The titular short is placed first in the collection, revealing its hand fairly early — F*ckface is the name of narrator Pretty’s manager at the grocery store at which she is employed. Pretty, a young, queer girl, struggles with her desire to get out of her small town. Like Pretty, most of Hampton’s characters are interesting, complex women. “Wicked,” the collection’s third story, focuses on Margaret, eccentric and single, who struggles to find her voice and her self in her hometown where everyone “treated Margaret like the spare button on the inside of a shirt.” She grapples with her relationship with her sister and unresolved trauma from high school. “Parkway”’s protagonist, Priscilla, becomes a forest ranger when there are no other female rangers, but finds her love for the park eroded by the often distressing nature of her work. In “Mingo,” Tina is the only one with the strength to stand up to her father-in-law, who refuses to acknowledge his failing health.
Environmentalism is also at the heart of every one of these stories. While “Mingo” is about Tina’s father-in-law’s latest stint in the hospital, it conveys a deep sense of attachment and loss for the beautiful mountaintops that have been razed for mining or development. Industry also plays a large role in this collection, with “Meat” providing a stark account of horrifying feedlots and “Twitchell'' delivering a nuanced yet scathing critique of the irresponsibility of petrochemical companies by showing the health consequences of their unregulated runoff on a town. Given that some individuals in “Twitchell” refuse to acknowledge these events, the story also shows the dangers of withholding information and misleading citizens. “Parkway” directly comments on the irreverent way humans treat nature, noting that people “empty sorrows and trash out of ourselves into them [parks]” and depicting how this disregard for nature takes its toll on individuals by paralleling it with Priscilla’s inability to cope with it. And in “Boomer,” Larry’s state forests and marriage burn, the former a result of drier seasons caused by a victim of drier seasons due to climate change.
In spite of the pointed attacks on human tampering and destruction, there is beauty and appreciation for nature within these stories. Nearly every short is built on lovely descriptions of landscapes, and even the metaphors about people and events are wonderfully grounded in connections to nature. In “Devil,” a character is described as having “eyes like brackish water.” Animals often crop up within the collection, with the somewhat sinister naturalist who leads their nature hike in “Frogs” being described as bat-like, and Beth, the main character in “Sparkle,” describes scientists moving as like “awkward birds.”
“F*ckface” is honest and real, and heartbreakingly sad, with every story ending on a perfectly open stopping point that leaves readers with no happy endings. Though its emotional weight peters out somewhat towards the end, with slightly less strong stories like “Queen,” “Saint,” “Meat,” or “Sparkle,” Hampton never fails to bring us a deeply intimate look into the world of Appalachian living or valuable insights into human environmental impact.

Ten years ago, Jennifer Egan published “A Visit from the Goon Squad,” which went on to win the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize. “A Visit from the Goon Squad” consists of thirteen chapters that are very different from one another in mood and style, each with its own protagonist; but unlike a short story collection, the chapters and characters are all interconnected in a structural spiderweb, coming together to tell a single story — a story about technology and the music industry. At the center of Egan’s web is a music producer named Benny Salazar and his assistant Sasha. The other stories radiate out from that central core, visiting peripheral characters in Benny and Sasha’s past and future lives.
“A Visit from the Goon Squad” spans fifty years, jumping back and forth in time, from the 1970s to an imagined version of the 2020s. In fact, time itself is practically a character in Egan’s book, constantly reshaping characters, the music industry, and technology. “Time’s a goon, right?” asks Benny Salazar, giving the book its name. Given that “A Visit from the Goon Squad” is a book about time that tried to predict American life in 2020, it deserves to be revisited in 2020, ten years after its publication.
“The problem is it’s not about sound anymore. It’s not about music,” vents an exasperated Bennie Salazar in the final chapter of “A Visit from the Goon Squad.” Over the course of the book, Jennifer Egan traces the shifting mindset of the music industry, from the rebellious rock ‘n’ roll of the 70s, when music was the heartbeat of sex and drugs and iconoclasm, to a futuristic, technologically-run music industry obsessed with money. In Egan’s version of the 2020s, Bennie is able to draw thousands of people to his friend Scotty Hausmann’s concert using social media — without Scotty ever having released a single song. As people are flocking to Scotty’s concert, they’re all telling each other how Scotty Hausmann is supposed to be great live, even though none of them have ever seen him perform.
For these blind sheep, the people of Egan’s 2020, it is not about the sound or the message or the soul of the music. Concert-going is a fad. The music must be good because their “headset” told them so (Jennifer Egan envisioned all this before the release of the iPhone). The music must be good because their internet friend said so. Benny’s team hypes up Scotty Hausmann by targeting and hiring specific online presences as “parrots,” who promote the concert to their social media followers.
In real life 2020, targeted ads on Facebook and Instagram play a huge role in the music industry. Artists and their record labels can choose exactly which demographic to try to pitch their music to. A new singer-songwriter who sounds just like Taylor Swift and dresses goth can run ads on Instagram that are only shown to goth teenage girls who are fans of Taylor Swift, thus garnering thousands of fans in a matter of days. In line with Egan’s prediction, the music that is popular is often determined by large avaricious record labels. Individual taste is trumped or exploited by online ad campaigns.
Not only does “A Visit from the Goon Squad” predict the effects of technology on art and the music industry, but also technology’s effects on politics. Egan writes that words like “American” and “democracy” become ironic in the 2020s, “shucked of their meanings and reduced to husks.” When institutions can pay to subliminally sway the minds of the American public through social media, elections become a game of money. Democracy is dead because votes are bought through advertisement. As Egan predicted, American democracy was called into question as early as the 2016 election, with talk of Russian interference.
In the 2020 presidential race, young voters, who are generally more liberal, are bombarded by advertisements paid for by the Democratic Party to “Go vote!” while the Republican Party pays to send the same message to the older, more conservative generation. Whether we like it or not, technology has given institutions the power to sway the opinions of the public, both artistic and political.
If artistic opinion can be manipulated by large companies, where does that leave the arts? If social media can make Scotty Hausmann a rock star overnight without any songs, is the passion that fueled the rock ‘n’ roll of the 70s dead? Jennifer Egan gives us a hopeful message at the story’s end. In the final chapter, Scotty Hausmann’s concert is a success — not because of social media, but because of the music itself. The thousands gathered around the stage are moved by Scotty’s “ballads of paranoia and disconnection.”
As technology continues to disrupt and divide, art and music retain the power to affirm us and to reunite us. One of the stories in “A Visit from the Goon Squad” is about a boy who is obsessed with finding pauses within songs. His dad asks him why he is so obsessed with the pauses, and the boy answers, “The pause makes you think the song will end. And then the song isn’t really over, so you’re relieved. But then the song does actually end, because every song ends, obviously, and THAT. TIME. THE. END. IS. FOR. REAL.” The boy’s obsession with the pauses shows us how we must cling to hope. In these modern times, where music seems cheap, American democracy is threatened, individuality is suppressed, isolation is encouraged, and art seems powerless, we must stay hopeful and keep listening for the song to start up again. The song is not over.

How do you tell a coming of age story in a future-less world?
That’s the challenge Lydia Millet takes on in “A Children’s Bible,” her new contribution to the growing canon of climate change fiction. The novel follows teenaged Evie and her little brother Jack, who spend the summer together in a lake house along with the children of their parents’ college friends. While the parents spend their days in the house blissfully drunk, the kids wander throughout nature, desperately avoiding their parents to the point of competing to see who can hide from them the longest.
The vacation, however, is tinted by a sense of foreboding. Something is about to give. As Evie remarks, “At that time in my personal life, I was coming to grips with the end of the world. The familiar world, anyway.” Sure enough, when a huge storm brings flooding and destruction, the world as she knows it does end, and Evie and the others find themselves navigating a new chaotic terrain.
The most effective part of this novel is the structure, which follows the general narrative framework of the Bible. The Biblical framework works so well because it allows for the story to exist in the context of past crises humanity has faced. There’s a flood followed by a plague, an exodus, a surprise birth (which happens just a couple miles east of a town called Bethlehem). All the while Jack, using the Bible, tries to draw connections between these events.
Millet’s choice to diverge from the specific plot points of the Bible forces both the reader and the characters to reinterpret these ancient stories of human experience to meet the moment they face. Sometimes these references can feel a little forced and heavy-handed, but they never come off as proselytizing. Instead, Millet’s references to the Bible paint a complicated relationship between the resources of the past and the possibilities of an uncharted future.
The other great strength of the novel is Millet’s reinterpretation of coming of age tropes. At first glance, “A Children’s Bible” can seem like a pretty run-of-the-mill coming of age story. The major emotional threads of the story are Evie’s feelings of disillusionment with society, disconnection from her parents, and her desire to understand her role in the world — all classic elements of the genre. In fact, with her wry tone, lack of sentimentality, and close relationship with her innocent younger sibling, Evie is strikingly similar to Holden Caulfield.
What seperates “A Children’s Bible” from the books that came before it is that though the story is related through the eyes of Evie, the book is less about her coming of age and more about the coming of age of the climate change generation. Evie often eschews the first person, using “we” to refer to the collective actions and feelings of all the kids. While Evie and the rest of the kids certainly have issues with their individual parents, most of their resentment is towards them as an age group who knew about climate change and did nothing to stop it. As Evie remarks, “We knew who was responsible, of course: it was a done deal before we were born.”
There’s a sense, furthermore, in the book that the parents have not only let down their children, but that they are over-depending on them to save the world from situations of crisis. Any Millennial or Gen Z-er who has been told by someone older than them that “Your generation will save us” will recognize this feeling. As a veteran novelist who has published 12 books previously and is in her 50s, Millet's ability to accurately capture the feelings of the younger generation is a triumph.
Though “A Children’s Bible” delivers on big ideas and beautiful prose, it lacks compelling characters. Evie, the narrator, remains an interesting voice throughout the book, but her distanced attitude towards the other characters makes it difficult for the reader to gain a good sense of their personality and even harder to care about them. Sometimes Millet’s vague characterizations work, most notably with the parents who represent the repugnance of an older generation, more than they carry actual emotional weight. For the majority of the book, however, the side-characters come off as so comically evil, or good, or stupid, that the stakes of the situation feel lower than they are.
Its flaws notwithstanding, “A Children’s Bible” is a beautiful and worthwhile read. While it's not exactly hopeful, the book provides its readers with a sense that meaning can be sought even when the world falls apart.

With its magical realist style, thematic substance, nuggets of oral history, and awkward dad jokes , “Echo on the Bay” is a challenging novel to categorize. From the vantage point of the new girl in town, Miki, we are introduced to the intricate multigenerational story of Oita Prefecture.
“Nothing serious happens,” begins Masatsugu Ono’s novel. Yet, readers are held in suspense for all 150 pages of the story, acutely aware that there is more than meets the eye to this sleepy fishing town. An abandoned boat in the bay. A sodden village celebrity. Not to mention a budding romance between teenage Miki and her 24-year-old social studies teacher.
"People who forget the past repeat it. We have to remember. We have to atone. And now the opportunity had come”: Throughout the book, the time oscillates between 1940s and present-day Oita, guided in large measure by the Silica Four, a gossipy group of four village elders with silicosis. These elders live quite comfortably off government pay-outs and congregate at Miki's home to drink with her father, the police chief. Gradually, they divulge the darkest secrets of this sleepy fishing village. A trigger warning would help, as Masatsugu Ono embeds multiple accounts of physical and sexual abuse into the narrative and vividly describes many atrocities from the Japanese occupations of Manchuria and Korea.
There are several reasons why “Echo on the Bay” is a seriously difficult read, with its lack of formal structure and signposting given that the book is told as one long chapter, senseless cruelties, uncomfortable scenes, and its dissatisfying denouement. At one point, Miki voices her own exasperation with the messy narrative:
"I'd once seen an NHK Education TV show in which a western ethnologist described the frustration people of his profession feel when they can't get at the information they're looking for. I was beginning to understand that frustration myself,” Ono writes. “Just when you think your informants are about to tell you something, they go off on a tangent, recounting anecdotes of no direct relevance … The ethnologists begin to think that their sincere attempts to discover truths about a society and culture are being deliberately obstructed."
A reader might find him or herself longing for further character development, as we are given rather limited airtime with each member of the village. Ono, however, is liberal with his descriptions of the coast, taking pains to ensure the reader is under no illusions that Oita is a charming seaside village. On the contrary, it reeks of manure, fish, and rotten bodies.
Ono writes, "When I get out of the car, there's a dry smell, like manure. Flies buzz around my head, their abdomen and wings bright in the sunshine — rough, black beads of light... There are flies on my sweaty thighs and calves. They keep lifting off and resettling, sipping at the perspiration."
Despite the stench seeping through the novel, Ono continues to masterfully lure readers in with sleek prose and clever metaphors. Make no mistake, “Echo on the Bay” is for the persevering, patient, and curious reader. Comparable to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's “100 Years of Solitude”, it might help to sketch up your own family tree to follow along. Remember, there is a reason for everything: from the way the village drunk’s fingers shake like needles of a broken compass to the soured relationship between the local assemblyman Yoshi-ni and his sister, Hatsue. Listen closely to Ono’s “Echo on the Bay,” and you just might trace its source.

With creative challenges, witty hosts, and darling contestants, Season Eight of “ The Great British Baking Show” is shaping up to be an excellent escape from the chaos of the world. The return of the beloved series, coupled with the fact that the episodes will air weekly on Netflix in the US three days after their UK premiere, is one of the few headlines of 2020 that have inspired tears of joy rather than tears of frustration.
The pandemic has naturally caused significant changes in the competition’s format. Formerly, contestants would spend weekends on set and have the weekdays to return to their regular lives. This year, all 12 contestants have agreed to isolate from their loved ones in the first-ever “British Bake-Off Village.” Bakers, along with judges, hosts, and crew are spending the duration of the competition at an undisclosed hotel, and the process, which usually lasts 12 weeks, has been condensed into six. While the bakers do express their homesickness, the camaraderie is still immense, and the rapport between the contestants and judges is full of a warmth and hilarity quite uncommon for television during these turbulent times. Despite these changes, however, the structure of each episode is largely the same, making watching Season Eight feel like returning to an old friend.
Season Eight kicked off with Cake Week, and the challenges for this year’s bakers were as intense as ever. The signature challenge required the competitors to make a classic battenberg (a carefully crafted cake with geometric patterns and colorful marzipan), the technical portion asked for six pineapple upside-down cakes (deceptively tricky treats that require impeccable timing), and the showstopper round demanded celebrity cake busts made in only four hours (featuring dessert versions of Lupita Nyong'o, Freddie Mercury, and Charles Darwin). Per “The Great British Baking Show” standard, contestants shot for the stars with mixed results, leading judge Paul Hollywood to dish out advice of “say less, and then do more.”
With every task doled out by the judges, there was a talented, lovable crew of bakers ready to rise to the challenge. As the show revealed the contestant’s personalities through a variety of clips from both in and out of the tent, each baker quickly transformed into a hero worth cheering for by the end of the first episode. Early standouts include Peter, this week’s star baker, whose exquisite technique and warm compassion were obvious from just the first round. In Peter’s introduction, he talked about bringing the recipes he makes for his gluten-intolerant brother into the tent, encouraging audiences to root for Peter as he executed more technically challenging bakes, and making his wheat-free battenberg success all the more exciting.
Sura, often shown dashing to assist her fellow contestants, was a model of good character as well as good baking. Sura was also caught in an unfortunate mishap this week — during the technical, when she was swatting a bug away from the gingham altar of completed bakes, she accidentally knocked over a tray of treats belonging to fellow contestant Dave. With clips of the two discussing the incident, as well as confirmation from the hosts that the judges would only evaluate Dave on the cakes that stayed intact, it was clear that there was no blame nor any hard feelings between the two. Despite this, Sura felt so guilty that she couldn’t muster a smile even as she won the challenge. A bittersweet moment, this is the worst of the drama that the tent offers, and it makes one adore the contestants even more for their genuineness and vulnerability.
Unfortunately, viewers also had to say goodbye to their first baker this week. A fast favorite for her sense of humor and willingness to think outside the box, Loreia was sent home for a series of ambitious but flawed bakes. Despite her setbacks, Loreia’s openness about her mistakes and her enthusiasm for bringing her identity into her baking made it all the more devastating to see her go, and the sadness evoked by her elimination proves how effectively the show conveys the best of each contestant.
In addition to the new starry-eyed bakers, the season premiere welcomed another unfamiliar face to the tent. As former host Sandi Toksvig announced her departure from the show in January, actor-comedian Matt Lucas has joined the host team as Noel Fielding’s new partner in crime. Though one might worry about the time it could take Lucas to become completely integrated into the show, Lucas’s good-natured personality quickly curbed any anxieties. Lucas fits into the humor and whimsy of the show like a missing puzzle piece. His banter with Fielding and the contestants was delightful and sincere. A highlight of Lucas’s debut occured after the mishap between Sura and Dave: Lucas can be seen coaxing a smile from a sullen Sura, telling her that it was really his own fault, since he was looking at her when it happened and she must have been “hypnotized by his beauty.” The vibrant atmosphere of the tent is best described by judge Prue Leith, who laughingly laments that between Fielding, Lucas, and her co-judge Hollywood, “there’s not a grown-up among you!”
All in all, this season of “ The Great British Baking Show” is shaping up to be deeply wonderful. After one episode, this wholesome competition enraptures audiences to continue watching the bakers’ journeys unfold in the tent.

In the beginning, and for most of its first two centuries, Harvard was just the College. And by 1840, when the original Harvard Alumni Association was formed, nearly all Harvard alumni were graduates of the College.
It can be said that Harvard became a university from 1872 when the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was established. Over the last half-century, Harvard’s graduate, professional, and extension schools have experienced substantial growth, far exceeding the more modest growth of the undergraduate college. For example, when I graduated in 1969, Harvard awarded 1,438 B.A. and B.S. degrees and 3,070 other degrees. By my 50th reunion in 2019, Harvard awarded 1,554 baccalaureate degrees and 5,111 others. The proportion of B.A. and B.S. degrees had decreased from 32 percent to only 23 percent.
There are currently around 120,600 living Harvard College graduates, who now represent just 38 percent of the University’s nearly 315,000 alumni. The HAA has responded by evolving into an umbrella organization comprising representatives of individual school alumni groups, regional Harvard clubs, and many special interest groups, while simultaneously attempting to continue as the alumni organization for graduates of Harvard College.
Every Harvard school, except for Harvard College, has its own alumni organization. The 11 graduate, professional, and Extension alumni organizations elect officers and nominate altogether 22 members of the HAA Board of Directors. Twenty-seven clubs have 35 directors. Thirty-two former HAA presidents have lifetime membership on the HAA Board.
To be sure, there are now 25 “Directors for Harvard College” on the Board, but though these members are College alumni, they were not formally nominated or elected by fellow College alumni. They serve by appointment of the HAA Executive Committee. Furthermore, I have never received any communication from these “College alumni” directors about whatever they were working on.
In general, I have found communication about current happenings in the College to be sparse and only one way from the HAA. When a University committee was considering changes to the text of “Fair Harvard,” I did not see the HAA make any effort to inform the alumni about it or to solicit feedback from us. In response to the pandemic, I have not seen the HAA make much use of technology to build or support the community of alumni, especially older alumni at home now with lots of free time. Individual classes have purchased Zoom accounts for community conversations, virtual lunches and cocktail hours, book talks and lectures, and other social and intellectual programming. The HAA has seemingly made no effort to promote or coordinate these undertakings. Many alumni have thus come to view the HAA as just an agent of fundraising.
Many class leaders also believe that the HAA has not sustained a satisfactory level of service to College alumni as its other programs have grown in extent and breadth. Historically, the HAA’s most important service to College alumni has been assistance to reunion planners. But frequent and high staff turnover, with a loss of institutional memory, has meant that volunteer reunion leaders must often provide on-the-job training to HAA staff. As one group of reunion leaders wrote, “We should not have to reinvent the wheel every five years.”
One friend described reunion committees as “the backbone of class activities and culture,” and added that good culture begets generous giving. Yet the HAA does not seem to want the opinions of reunion leaders or to encourage them to share common concerns or even to communicate except on the HAA’s agenda. For example, as co-chair for my 50th reunion, I hoped to discuss with fellow 2019 reunion chairs ways that we might collaborate to keep costs down, but HAA leadership refused several requests for their names and contact information.
Harvard University should accord its College degree holders equal status to all its other graduates by creating an alumni organization focused on them, on all of them, from recent graduates to the oldest. College graduates, like all other Harvard alumni, should have the opportunity to elect their leaders and representatives. They love Harvard and expect their alumni organization to help them maintain strong intellectual and social connections with their College and with their classmates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a strange comfort in discovering that the bedtime stories my parents chose to tell me often came from one of the longest epics in the world: the “Mahabharata.” The “Mahabharata” is a fourth-century BCE Sanskrit poem traditionally attributed to Vyasa, and its stories permeate the Hindu tradition. It’s about a fratricidal war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas over the kingdom of Hastinapura, and narrates the intertwining fates of these clans and their successors. Part of the comfort is that the “Mahabharata” is long — about seven times the Iliad and Odyssey combined — and thus an endless ravine for a wandering mind.
More central, though, is the scale and texture of the epic’s violence and loss, and the fact that it always seems to engage with my contemporary predicaments. In the end, even in triumph, every insult, favor, disguise, and promise matters—sometimes with catastrophic consequences. When the war has run its course, the battlefield is described as a river of blood where pebbles are severed heads. The casualties are not just enormous; they are total.
This irreversible tragedy is what Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, stands to inherit. On the verge of abandoning the kingdom, and even fasting unto death, Yudhishthira turns to his grandfather, Bhishma, who is known for his prophetic scriptural wisdom. However, Yudhishthira’s first question has nothing to do with sacred text. He simply asks why he can’t shake the sadness of having caused so much carnage. Why, he asks, does victory feel so much like defeat? What if we hadn’t? What if we had? Would things be different?
The “Mahabharata” isn’t exactly describing a pandemic, or national political upheaval, but it does speak to a reality we experience this year: widespread death, injustice, confusion, and uncertainty about the future in a peculiarly fatalistic way. That is to say, like in the “Mahabharata,” we can trace the causes and effects of many tragedies. The spread of coronavirus is exacerbated by those who do not wear masks or take precautions, for instance. Racial inequities are perpetuated by insidious systemic biases and ignorant people. Increased carbon dioxide emissions and an aggravated atmosphere make forest fires more likely. We know why things happen, and even if we can’t explain how the mechanisms got started in the first place, we can think of lots of ways in which the world could have been, or could still be, better. Yet, months, even years, of decisions keep catching up with us.
Sometimes, we are powerless — or too tired — to overcome their consequences. I think it is the whopping burden of this fact that makes a concept like radical forgiveness or love — the idea that all of that sediment might just get washed away — so appealing. But sometimes ubiquitous statements don’t help. For instance, Bhishma speaks of a paradigm in which all living things must eventually die before they are reborn, and therefore deaths should not be grieved. Unsurprisingly, Yudhishthira’s grief resists that logic. Why, after all, should the fact that all that is born must die diminish Yudhishthira’s grief for the deaths of his own brother, sons, and nephews? Time may indeed be cyclical, and fate may turn the wheel to happier times only to fall into misery later, but our lives feel no less real. Yudhishthira teaches us that we do not grieve in generalities, and therefore generalities cannot vanish grief.
Grief is as much a multidimensional condition as a mental state, and one of Yudhishthira’s final questions to Bhishma reflects his transformed reality. He asks: Which is a better means of knowing, direct perception, or scriptural authority? The question has some technical philosophical meanings, but we can interpret it variously: Should I trust my experiences, or the wisdom of those who have lived before me? Should I dwell in my grief, or reason myself out of it? Bhishma’s response is this: to the extent that there are limits to reason, seek guidance. And, your experiences are uniquely yours, so don’t expect them to adhere to the paths of those who came before. The response is circular, but it’s a circle that encloses Yudhishthira and propels him forward. Let go, not because the primeval wheel is turning, but because your wheel is turning. The decisions are catching up to us, but there are still opportunities for us as individuals — ballots, masks, our relationships — to make new ones.
It would be silly to say that afterwards, Yudhishthira stops grieving. He doesn’t really ever forget — or stop experiencing — the consequences of the war. The “Mahabharata” gives us a semblance of a happy ending, but it never lets us forget our grief, and in that way doesn’t end at all. For now, as the pandemic evolves, and as the state of the nation remains in flux, we remember the same: grief is particular but permeating, painful but permeable. Its contradictions ultimately deliver us from it.

As members of the Azerbaijani community of Harvard, we are writing to express our concern that a recently published opinion piece, “Armenia’s Two Battles: War Amid the Pandemic” (October 2) misrepresents the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and misleads its readers into taking action against Azerbaijan.
The authors start by claiming that Azerbaijan attacked Artsakh on September 27, and that the fighting is continuing in Armenia proper. But responsibility for the aggression is disputed. Under the conditions of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, signed by Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, an attack on any one of these countries would necessitate an immediate military involvement of all other member states. Attacking Armenia would therefore result in a full-blown war with Azerbaijan on one side and Armenia, Russia, and the rest of the CSTO on the other. As such, it is simply against Azerbaijan's best interests to let any missiles drop within Armenia's borders.
Additionally, calling Artsakh a “de-facto Armenian state” implies that this state is internationally recognized, while not a single United Nations member state, not even Armenia itself, has officially recognized this republic, and starting the article with such a bold proclamation is misleading.
The article also alleges that Syrian mercenaries are fighting on Azerbaijan’s behalf. This accusation remains unverified: The Guardian article, the authors cite, admits to having not confirmed the veracity of reports that Syrian fighters have arrived in Azerbaijan. Much of the evidence for this rumor has been alleged to be fake. Moreover, the CNN article proclaiming that Syrian rebels were recruited as mercenaries was based on a WhatsApp conversation with an unidentified Syrian.
It is also important to mention that every Azerbaijani male over age 18 undergoes one to two years of military training. Azerbaijan has not even gone beyond a “partial mobilization,” so the proposition that the nation needs Syrian rebels to fight its battles is ludicrous.
The op-ed then states that Armenia and Artsakh are “withstanding attacks from Azerbaijan and Turkey,” yet, as is argued above, it provides no confirmed evidence of Turkey’s military involvement in the conflict. As for “depopulat[ing] Artsakh and Armenia of Armenians,” Azerbaijan has not depopulated Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, or other cities of Armenians — while a Azerbaijan mosque in Nagorno-Karabakh seems to have been used as a pigsty.
Additionally, and ironically, even Azerbaijani-Armenians in Azerbaijan are under military threat from Armenia, as evident from the Armenian missile attack on the Azerbaijani city of Ganja on October 4 injuring Karina Grigoryan.
In the end, the op-ed draws a baseless connection between the events in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and the current conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Given that Azerbaijan had never been a part of the Ottoman Empire, what reasons other than xenophobia or complete ignorance of history may the authors of this op-ed have had to lump 21st-century Azerbaijan together with the early 20th-century Ottoman Empire?

The Cambridge City Council voted Monday night to pass an affordable housing overlay zoning petition.
The overlay — a key issue in the last election cycle — will allow affordable housing developers to compete with market rates by streamlining the permitting process for units that are deemed 100 percent affordable.
Councilors voted 7-2 in favor of passing the measure. The vote comes on the heels of the Cambridge Ordinance Board’s vote to recommend the overlay to the entire council in late August.
In an emailed statement, City Councillor and former Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern wrote he is “extremely happy to see the Affordable Housing Overlay pass after 2 plus years and over 40 public and community meetings.”
“As it stands, our zoning has made it almost impossible for affordable housing to be built in certain areas, the AHO will help change that,” McGovern wrote.
McGovern, along with Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, and Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr., sponsored the proposal to re-introduce the overlay after the initial proposal was dropped in 2019.
McGovern also described how the affordable housing overlay “will be one more tool in our tool box” to ensure younger residents in Cambridge will be able to settle permanently in the city.
“Many of the folks who have opposed the AHO came to Cambridge as students, fell in love with the city and were able to rent and then eventually buy a home,” McGovern wrote. “That is impossible for most college students today. We need to change that.”
“I want the current generation to have the opportunities that past generations had,” McGovern added.
In a press release Monday, Rebecca M. Schofield, co-chair of affordable housing advocacy group A Better Cambridge, wrote the housing overlay will not only bring more affordable units to Cambridge, but also that its passage shows the city’s commitment to “housing equity.”
The press release described how the “greater density allowed under the AHO will help affordable housing developers compete with market-rate developers when land becomes available, which will increase diversity and further racial and economic equity in historically white and wealthy areas of the city.”
The City Council also deliberated on a cycling safety ordinance in response to the death of a cyclist struck by a tractor-trailer in Harvard Square in August.
Councilors voted 7-1 in favor of a proposed set of amendments to the ordinance, which would set a 2026 deadline for completing a 22.6-mile network of protected bike lanes across the city. The amended ordinance will now be up for discussion by the Ordinance Committee before it can be recommended to the City Council for passage.

The Harvard Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children held a virtual panel Tuesday evening called “Context and Casualties: Racial Inequalities During COVID-19,” to discuss the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on racial minorities.
David Harris, the managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School, and Harvard Kennedy School professor of criminal justice Sandra S. Smith offered insights on why they believe Black, Latinx, and indigenous populations have been especially vulnerable to the novel coronavirus.
Many racial minorities face greater risk of exposure due to their jobs, they said. According to Harris, 80 percent of Black workers are unable to work at home, and Black Americans are disproportionately overrepresented in essential frontline jobs.
Harris and Smith also said the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on racial minorities are derived from racial disparities in the criminal justice system, healthcare system, and socioeconomic inequalities. One cannot think about solutions to these issues without also considering solutions to their longstanding roots, Harris said.
“COVID might be forcing us to look at and investigate and come up with solutions to things that existed before COVID and will exist after COVID,” Harris said.
The Harvard FIMRC decided on Tuesday's topic in light of the ongoing pandemic, the racial and social issues arising from COVID-19, and the Black Lives Matter movement protests, according to both Harvard FIMRC Co-Vice President Huong T. Le ’22 and Speaker Series Lead Ciaran S. Brayboy ’23.
While the event’s central focus was on the impacts of COVID-19, both Le and Brayboy said in an interview that they hoped attendees would take away from the conversation a broader awareness of the racial inequalities and discrimination in the healthcare system, as well as the implicit biases in the medical field.
“It’s important to note that all these disparities in the healthcare system didn’t just arise during the COVID pandemic,” Brayboy said. “The discrimination was here before this, but I feel like the COVID pandemic just really forced those things out and really made people aware of them.”
Brayboy said it is especially important for Harvard undergraduates planning to pursue medicine to participate in these conversations to better understand the experiences of those to whom they otherwise would not be able to relate.
“Medical care is so much more than just treating a patient’s physical ailments, and that’s really why we put on this talk,” Brayboy said. “It’s really about understanding the patient, understanding their background, understanding the patient’s culture, at the end of the day, that provides them the most comfort.”
The conversation was part of a series by the FIMRC leading up to a global health equity conference, where participants will address inequality within the global health system. The conference will take place during reading period at the end of the fall semester.
“The conference will include activities for participants in the community to get engaged in actively thinking about how they can be a part of making a change and addressing these issues,” Le said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s Educational Policy Committee is considering reopening the option to take a course pass-fail, even though the original deadline has passed, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said in a faculty meeting Tuesday.
Claybaugh said the idea stemmed from a proposal the Undergraduate Council unanimously passed Sunday calling for “student-friendly” grading policies as most undergraduates continue to attend classes remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The UC legislation suggests extending the pass-fail deadline to Nov. 30 and allowing courses taken as pass-fail to count for concentration and General Education credit. The deadline to petition to change a class’s grading status to pass-fail is the fifth Monday of the semester, which was Oct. 5.
“The timing, to be frank, is a little unfortunate,” Claybaugh said. “The UC came up with this idea on Sunday, so we are now considering it as an EPC and we’ll have a decision soon.”
After Harvard sent most students home to de-densify its campus in March, the Educational Policy Committee decided to shift to a universal emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system for the spring semester. The committee decided to return to a normal grading system this fall despite the unusual circumstances.
Claybaugh did not say to what date the committee was considering extending the pass-fail deadline, or whether it was considering using pass-fail courses for concentration and general education credit.
Tuesday’s meeting, held via Zoom, was the second virtual faculty meeting FAS has held since Harvard moved to remote work and teaching in March. Faculty voted using Zoom’s poll function and applauded using the “clap” emoji; several forgot to unmute their microphones before speaking.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay also announced at the meeting that more than 150 FAS staff took voluntary early retirement packages this year as the school suffers the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
Harvard administrators said last week that nearly 700 staff across the University writ large agreed to retire by the end of the year in exchange for enhanced retirement benefits.
Gay also reported that a committee to examine Harvard’s tenure-track system — announced last December — is moving forward on schedule, and that she had appointed Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Hopi E. Hoekstra to chair it.
Faculty pushed for a review of the FAS’s tenure procedures last winter following the University’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña, whose scholarship engages with race and ethnicity. Hoekstra was not among the 107 faculty who signed the letter to Gay requesting the review.
Gay told The Crimson in March, however, that the committee will consider neither individual cases nor Harvard’s use of ad hoc committees, a particularly contentious part of the review process that some have argued disadvantages diverse candidates.
Gay said Tuesday that the committee will examine “many aspects” of the promotion procedures based on 15 years of experience with the tenure-track system, which was implemented in 2005.
“The committee will be charged with identifying where there are opportunities in our review process to be even more effective,” she said.

Harvard University and The Crimson both filed motions to dismiss a lawsuit brought in federal court by former University employee Eric Clopper over the school’s response to a 2018 performance that he put on at Sanders Theatre and the newspaper’s subsequent coverage of the event.
Harvard and The Crimson — which operate independently — both filed respective motions requesting that U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns dismiss the case due to a failure by the plaintiff to state a claim.
Harvard fired Clopper on July 12, 2018, just over two months after he held a performance at Sanders Theatre criticizing the practice of circumcision. During the show, Clopper — who is Jewish — referred to Jewish people as “an unmasked genital mutilation cult” and stripped nude.
In a lawsuit he filed July 20, Clopper — who formerly worked as a systems administrator at the Language Resource Center in Lamont Library — accused Harvard and The Crimson of defamation and libel, violating the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and other actions he said justify damages. His complaint also alleged that the University violated his First Amendment rights.
In a memorandum filed Sept. 29, the University wrote that Clopper’s suit “fails to state constitutional, statutory, contractual, or tort claims against Harvard.”
“Clopper’s contention that he had a ‘right’ to engage in live, naked, simulated intercourse with an inflatable doll on Harvard property, and display a still more explicit pornographic video, has no support in the law,” the filing read. “These activities are not ‘free speech’ protected by the First Amendment or any employment contract with the University.”
Clopper also accused the University of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of the employment agreement and free speech policy, breach of the contract for Sanders Theatre, tortious conversion, and a promissory estoppel claim.
Clopper’s lawsuit also claimed The Crimson’s coverage of the Sanders Theater event “interfered with Clopper’s right to free speech.” The suit claimed that a May 3, 2018 headline published by the newspaper characterizing the show as a “Nude, Anti-Semitic Rant” was “a patent falsehood.”
In a motion filed on Oct. 5, The Crimson wrote that the libel claim “fails.”
“The statements about which plaintiff complains were accurate (he did in fact appear ‘nude’); were statements of opinion (‘anti-Semitic’) based on disclosed true facts, fully protected under the First Amendment and Massachusetts Decl. of Rights Art. XVI; or were both, cloaked in rhetorical hyperbole (‘rant’) that is incapable of being proved true or false,” the filing read.
The Crimson’s President, Aidan F. Ryan ’21, wrote in a statement, “The Crimson is editorially and financially independent from Harvard University. In all of its reporting, The Crimson strives to fulfill its mission of upholding the highest standards of journalistic ethics.”
Clopper, who, according to his LinkedIn profile, now attends Georgetown Law School, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ashley V. Whillans, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, spoke about her new book, “Time Smart: How to Reclaim Your Time and Live a Happier Life,” as part of the “Books@Baker” speaker series Tuesday.
At the online event, Whillans noted the challenges of prioritizing time. She argued that financial security only goes so far, and emphasized that time, not money, is a better indicator of happiness.
“Time affluence, this feeling of having control and feeling like you have enough time on an everyday basis, can promote happiness,” she said.
She described her research, which suggests that those who value time over money tend to be happier, more civically engaged, and more inclined to pursue activities they are passionate about.
Whillans said her inspiration for the book stemmed from the fact that, as a first-year, tenure-track professor at HBS, she would give talks about the importance of leisure time, even though her research did not translate into her own life.
“And so I really embarked on this journey of writing this book to put what I was learning about in my academic research into practice,” she said.
Eighty percent of working Americans feel “time poor,” or feel as though they lack sufficient time to fulfill all their responsibilities, according to Whillans.
“These feelings of time poverty are associated with misery, sometimes to the same extent as being unemployed,” she said.
Whillans suggested four strategies to alleviate the feeling of being “time poor,” including prioritizing time over money, blocking off leisure time, outsourcing unwanted tasks, and considering leisure time just as essential as working.
“We want to be reframing our time to see leisure as something that’s productive and restful, and an end to itself,” she said.
During a question-and-answer session after her presentation, Whillans discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the pressure to constantly work as many people continue to work from home.
“We’re finding that breaks and boundaries exist less, so it really is as if we’re living at work because we don’t have this clear separation between work and home. So it’s critical that we all build in a buffer or commute right now to help with that mental separation,” she said.
Whillans emphasized that people should prioritize their time now more than ever.
“Focusing on time is not selfish,” she said. “It’s really in making enough time for ourselves that we’re able to have the energy and attention to best serve those that we cared about.”
The Books@Baker series hosts events for Business School faculty to present their latest work. Books@Baker will host its next live Zoom event on Nov. 18, when Business School professor Joseph L. Badaracco will discuss his book, “Step Back: How to Bring the Art of Reflection into Your Busy Life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four academics discussed the impact of COVID-19 on the economic and geopolitical integration of Eurasia in a Tuesday morning webinar.
The panel, “Will COVID-19 Curtail European-Eurasian Integration?”, featured Johns Hopkins doctoral candidate Yun Han, professorial lecturer Marsha McGraw Olive, research fellow Jacopo Maria Pepe, and Davis Center senior fellow Nargis Kassenova. Kent E. Calder, director of the John Hopkins Edwin O. Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies, moderated the panel. The Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard and Hopkins’s Reischauer Center co-sponsored the event.
“The intellectual inspiration for this was an interest that all of us have had, for some time, in the way that the Eurasian continent is being transformed,” Calder said in an interview after the panel.
Originally intended to be held in Iceland, the centers shifted Tuesday’s discussion online. The group discussed the pandemic’s impact on Eurasian countries still reacting to the rise of China, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and growth of the European Union.
“I think this was a very timely event,” said audience member Anu Anwar, a fellow at the Harvard Asia Center. “Scholars and policymakers are curious to know how COVID will affect [Eurasian integration] going forward.”
Pepe, who Calder described as “one of the rising stars in Eurasian analysis,” emphasized how the competing forces of the EU and Germany, Russia, and China have shaped the supercontinent.
“My sense is that the general trends won’t change, but we’ll have a new dynamic in the EU-Russia-China relation,” Pepe said.
“Greater diversification and multipolarization of routes and corridors which will increasingly include India and Southeast Asia” will characterize that dynamic, he added.
Han focused on Greece’s and Hungary’s relationships with China. The Belt and Road Initiative — China’s massive infrastructure project connecting East Asia to Europe — has strengthened those nations’ ties with Beiijing, according to Han. U.S.-China relations also play a role.
“As barriers to the American market continue to rise, circulation between China and the rest of Eurasia becomes ever more important,” Han said.
Later parts of the conversation examined Central Asia as a hub for Eurasian connectivity.
The region has suffered economically during the pandemic, as local production slowed and demand fell for exports like oil. Still, McGraw Olive said she believes the COVID-19 pandemic will “reshape and not replace” globalization.
The panelists discussed ways in which the pandemic might create a better future for the region.
“It is a window of opportunity, in a way, because it is a crisis, and crisis creates opportunity,” said Kassenova.
They said post-COVID Central Asia may find new opportunities to work with the EU and progress its digital, electric, and green economies.
Kassenova also noted that the region is benefiting from a boost in railway container traffic because of the pandemic.
“Whether it’s a temporary trend, we don’t know,” she said, in an interview after the panel.
“I'm inclined to think that the forces of deepening relationships across the continent are still there,” Calder said in his closing remarks. “Its evolution and integration is still proceeding.”

Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley approved renaming the school's Holmes Society in honor of physician-scientist William Augustus Hinton, Class of 1905, the first Black tenured professor at Harvard.
HMS and Harvard School of Dental Medicine students are assigned to one of five academic societies upon entering the schools. Until now, the Holmes Society bore the name of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Class of 1829, a writer, physician, and former Dean of Harvard Medical School.
Holmes was one of the first American intellectuals to promote the racist doctrine of eugenics. In 1850, he revoked the acceptances of the Medical School’s first three Black students, writing that the “intermixing of the white and black races in their lecture rooms is distasteful to a large portion of the class and injurious to the interests of the school.”
Hinton — a 1905 graduate of the College and later HMS — specialized in the fields of bacteriology and immunology. He created a new diagnostic blood test for syphilis, one the U.S. Public Health Service later adopted.
Earlier this year, two medical students launched a petition to rename the former Holmes Society due to Holmes’s support of eugenics and racism towards Black and Indigenous people. The petition garnered over 1000 signatures from HMS and HSDM faculty, administrators, students, and alumni.
A Faculty Council Subcommittee on Artwork and Cultural Representations task force composed of students and faculty drafted a set of qualities they hoped the society's new namesake would embody. The task force members then identified individuals who might best match those ideals, which led to Hinton’s selection.
“The quality that stood out about Professor Hinton, that I think really moved us towards his selection, was that he openly admitted his humanity,” Advisory Dean and Director of the Hinton Society Anthony V. D’Amico said. “There are times when people fail, and we saw one of his qualities is that he would fall in terms of his research or clinical practice, or in terms of his science, and he wouldn’t give up. And I think that that kind of tenacity and fortitude, courage, that students want to be reminded of.”
LaShyra T. Nolen, the author of the petition and Class of 2023 HMS student council president, said while the renaming of the academic society does not constitute an end to the conversation surrounding anti-racism at Harvard, this change makes clear that racist symbols or figures “are no longer going to be part of our DNA.”
Jalen A. Benson, the creator of the petition and a member of the Hinton Society, said as a Black student he finds it “so powerful to see that excellence will be rewarded, excellence will be recognized,” even if not during Hinton’s lifetime.
“Hinton wasn’t allowed to be a surgeon as he wanted to be, they wouldn’t take him on at Mass General,” Benson said. “So to see Harvard recognize contributions from people of color, especially Black people, means so much to me, because I can look and say I’m proud to be in Hinton, following the legacy of an exceptional provider, and especially an exceptional Black provider.”
“I think it’s powerful for all students because it tells them the way you look or where you’re from doesn't limit what you can do,” he added.

Harvard Economics professor Isaiah S. Andrews was one of 21 recipients of a 2020 MacArthur Fellowship, the MacArthur Foundation announced on Tuesday.
Andrews, who joined the Harvard faculty in 2018, was awarded $625,000 in the form of a MacArthur “Genius Grant” in honor of his work as an econometrician. Andrews’s research focuses on figuring out how to more reliably quantify uncertainty in data for public policy utilization.
Andrews said in an interview that he received the news around a month ago, but was not allowed to publicize it until the foundation’s official announcement. The only person he could tell was his husband.
“I got a call basically four weeks ago saying that I had gotten [the grant], and I was totally stunned because you can’t apply for it. I still don’t know who nominated me,” Andrews said.
According to the MacArthur Foundation website, two of the criteria for selection are “exceptional creativity” and “promise for important future advances based on a track record of significant accomplishments.”
“A highly productive researcher and generous collaborator, Andrews demonstrates keen insight into how to address key statistical challenges in econometrics that are directly useful to empirical economists and have relevance to multiple fields,” the Foundation’s website states.
Andrews most recently co-authored a paper for the American Economic Review on publication bias, a phenomenon where researchers preference statistical findings with more extreme implications over other findings that may indicate that “not much is going on.”
“We developed a method for looking at published studies and trying to figure out, ‘Does it look like some sorts of findings are more likely to be published than others?’” said Andrews. “And then if it does, we can take the published studies and try to undo the effect of this publication bias.”
Some of his other work has focused on weak identification, a phenomenon where a given dataset is not large enough to determine a causal effect. He and Anna Mikusheva, his dissertation advisor at MIT, came up with a new model for dealing with scenarios of weak identification.
“Isaiah is doing cutting-edge work that is increasing the sophistication and precision of analysis in the field,” FAS Dean of Social Science Lawrence D. Bobo told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication. “His work on matters of basic research design, fine-grained quantitative approaches, appropriate scope of inference, and the most rigorous statistical tests put him in a very special category.”
Andrews is also an associate editor of the American Economic Review, Econometrica, the Journal of Econometrics, and The Quarterly Journal of Economics, and a research associate for the National Bureau of Economic Research.
A third criterion of the Grant is “potential for the Fellowship to facilitate subsequent creative work.” In the future, the topic Andrews is considering pursuing is the Winner’s Curse, which explores how the results of treatment that does best in a randomized experiment likely overestimate the treatment’s effectiveness.
“Econometrics is important because economics is important, and a lot of the big questions that folks are asking in economics — what drives economic growth, what drives inequality, what drives intergenerational mobility, what drives booms in the economy — are super important to understand the world but also really important to guide public policy,” Andrews said.
“What I work on is developing new statistical tools to try to answer those questions,” he added.

Professor of Architectural History at the State University of New York at Buffalo Charles L. Davis II discussed his research on antiracist architecture in an online lecture hosted by the Graduate School of Design Tuesday evening.
His lecture, entitled “Cannon Fodder: Debating the Racial Politics of Canonicity in Modern Architectural History,” called for an antiracist framework when viewing architecture both in the past and the present.
Davis said in an interview with The Crimson the word “antiracist” is a term contemporary theorists use to “revise our understanding of what racism is and how it operates in our world.”
“When I am talking about an antiracist architectural history, I am actually talking about the ways that architectural history is used instrumentally, as a kind of ideological tool to reaffirm certain forms of privilege or power structures in our discipline,” he said.
An antiracist study of architectural history would be aware of racial bias, Davis added.
“From my perspective, an antiracist architectural history is conscious of this bias, and tries to make up for it by critiquing that worldview, and then presenting us with alternative examples that both expand our sense of what architecture is, and what makes good design,” he said.
Davis argued conventional understandings of architecture are entrenched in ideals of the Western canon and white supremacy. European standards of architecture made their way to the United States, further contributing to the erasure of Native Americans and other non-white peoples.
“European ideas and European customs were transformed first into a new native form of culture through the material culture of white settlers, pilgrims and those who are settling the so-called virgin landscape,” Davis said, adding that this “then erased the memories of Native Americans and those who were here before European settlers.”
Despite the cultural replacement caused by foreign settlers, Davis cited famed American architects Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright — who were champions of a uniquely American style of architecture which took place predominantly in the Midwest — as offering “something that was unique from European revival styles that were occurring on the east coast.”
“That was uniquely American, both vernacular to the place and also modern to the time period,” Davis said.
He emphasized the necessity of interrogating what American architecture signified and which communities, cultures, and lived experiences the umbrella term excludes.
“I am really trying to isolate and then push back against exclusively white definitions of national character that define who was American and whose character was most central to how it is that we understood what American architecture was,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is piloting a new teaching fellow training focused on diversity, inclusion, and belonging in two Computer Science courses this fall.
The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning; the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging; and the Computer Science department created the training. It has debuted in Computer Science 121: “Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science” and Computer Science 61: “Systems Programming and Machine Organization.”
The training is composed of two parts, according to Nari G. Johnson ’21, a member of the Harvard Women in Computer Science Advocacy Council and organizer of the program. An asynchronous component on Canvas invites participants to read about diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS. A second component include live discussions, role playing, and personal reflections.
CS 121 teaching fellows and instructors completed their live synchronous training last week in a session led by SEAS Assistant Director of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Veronica D. Santana and Bok Center Assistant Director of Equity and Inclusion Noelle R. Lopez. The session saw full attendance from the course teaching staff, according to Santana.
Santana and Lopez said they enjoyed working through various scenarios with the CS 121 teaching staff in breakout rooms.
“My favorite one is where a TF or CA is with a student, and the student is just being very quiet. They’ve shown up to the office hour, it’s going on through Zoom,” Santana said. “The person who bravely volunteered to be the CA is just hearing silence from the student who has arrived at their office hour and having to take the lead and, very warmly but still directly and clearly, say, ‘Okay, so what part of the problem are you having an issue with?’”
Another scenario participants grappled with in the program’s asynchronous component involved an undergraduate course assistant receiving text messages late at night from friends in their course asking for help with an assignment.
“I just really liked that scenario because I think it helps surface some of the complex dynamics around friend dynamics and how there can be inequity in community or in exposure to different resources in CS,” Lopez said. “It also invites questions around, as a CA, where do you draw boundaries around what you believe to be fair interactions?”
Santana and Lopez said they have received positive feedback about the program’s asynchronous component and are in the process of gathering feedback from the CS 121 live session, which they will use to tailor the upcoming CS 61 synchronous session and other future trainings as the inaugural program continues to grow. They are considering the possibility of adding a third Computer Science course to the program this semester and running another pilot next spring.
Johnson and Daniela R. Shuman ’23, another member of the Harvard Women in Computer Science Advocacy Council, spearheaded the TF training initiative by submitting a proposal to the Computer Science Diversity Committee last summer. Their submission provided evidence in support of incorporating questions of privilege, diversity, and power into TF training, according to Johnson.
“The proposal outlined why we, as students, believed that inclusive teaching training was necessary in our department, citing evidence such as Q-scores or previous WiCS Advocacy Surveys,” Johnson wrote in an email. “This proposal was a jumping-off point for this year’s training, as the training’s curriculum was informed by the research and goals articulated in the proposal.”
Johnson added that she believes diversity and inclusion training is particularly important in the Computer Science department because a large proportion of teaching fellows and course assistants are undergraduates.
Shuman wrote in an email that her vision for the initiative involves scaling it to the entire Computer Science department — and potentially the entirety of SEAS.
“Every TF should have access to resources to make their teaching space as inclusive as possible, and we believe this is an effective way to do so,” Shuman wrote.
SEAS Undergraduate Program Coordinator Beth A. Musser, who helped connect the student organizers with the Bok Center and provided feedback during the program’s formation, said she hopes the pilot will ultimately make Computer Science a more welcoming concentration.
“I want students to know that anyone can concentrate in CS. I don’t want an offhand statement that a TF makes to ruin that for someone,” Musser said.

September usually brings about the start of a new school year and with it a new wardrobe; but this year, most of us haven’t really needed to go back-to-school shopping, since, well, we’re not back to school. Seeing as you may have forgotten how to get dressed over quarantine (what are jeans, anyway?), Flyby is here to help you out with all of your Zoom lecture outfit needs.
Business in the Front, Party in the Back
Or should we say business on the top party on the bottom? Whatever you want to call it, this has been a quarantine classic since the explosion of “Tiger King” and your banana bread making phase. We’ve all mastered the art of making ourselves presentable from the waist up while wearing those stained and/or ripped sweatpants that you really should have thrown out by now. Ah, the wonders of Zoom.
Business in the Front, Nothing in the Back… 
Some days, the effort required to just put on pants (even sweats) is just too much. So this is for those days, or those times when you swore you had enough time to get a shower in before your 11:15 a.m. Zoom check in with your math TF but when the time finally came, you just hadn’t made it to putting on pants (admit it, you’ve been there). There is something liberating about taking a call pantless. It’s not like they’ll ever know, right?
Pajamas: A Multi-purpose Look
There is no shame in waking up five minutes before your Zoom call — it happens to the best of us. Sometimes, time simply won’t permit going for our previous looks of semi-professional on the top. Luckily for us, oversized vintage t-shirts (which you may or may not have slept in the night before) are in, right? So, maybe consider investing in some high quality PJ sets this year instead of your usual attire (after all, it’s all about the #self-care).
The “I Actually Got Dressed Today”
Okay, so we’ve all read the articles about how sticking to a schedule and getting dressed every day during quarantine helps people live as normal of a life as possible and keeps them relatively sane. Long story short, they all include some form of “put on real clothes!!!” (and no, sweatpants don’t count). So, if you want to go the extra mile and budget in enough time for a real outfit before your 9 a.m. Zoom lecture, it might just help increase your productivity. Plus, you have to admire that one guy who shows up to Zoom class everyday wearing a suit.
So, while Zoom classes may not be ideal, the fashion choices it makes available to us might well be. Try out the “real clothing” look if you want to try and get your virtual life together, or enjoy your last few months (hopefully) of showing up to class pantless and/or in your most comfortable sweatshirt (no judgement here).
