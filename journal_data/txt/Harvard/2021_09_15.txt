After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I left campus, I was a freshman who had just, in the few weeks before being kicked off campus, found a place for herself at Harvard. Now, I’m a wanna-be junior, off-cycle sophomore simultaneously struggling to find the bathroom like it’s her first day here and trying to lead a student group with little to no institutional knowledge of what that should look like.
The pandemic took something unspeakably large from us. But so too did Harvard itself.
To be clear, I believe that Harvard’s biggest decisions — forcing us to leave campus in March 2020 and instituting online classes for the 2020-21 school year — were warranted, and, in the end, proved to be the right call. But it was Harvard administrators — the same Harvard administrators that we place trust in as a matter of necessity — that, with no warning, sent us emails asking us to leave campus and not come back.
No matter how much you agree with or respect Harvard’s decisions, that’s going to change your relationship with your institution. Harvard has given us so much, but it has also taken it all away in an instant.
I walk around campus and I see the places where I first met my friends, the places where I said goodbye to them for 17 long months, and the places where I recently reconnected with them. I see the classrooms where I had the most engaging conversations of my life in, and the classrooms I might have had, but didn’t. I see the meals I did have in Annenberg, the meal I had the night we were told we had to leave campus, and the meals I didn’t get to have in Annenberg.
The Harvard of 2019 feels familiar and I yearn for it, but the Harvard of 2021 feels distant, a confusing reality. I walk into buildings expecting to see people who have graduated. I didn’t recognize the people I had worked with for an entire year over Zoom. I can see what was and what should have been, but not what will be. And even though it’s irrational, I blame Harvard for that.
We’re trying to put a puzzle back together again, but some of the pieces are missing, and some have changed their shape, and we’ve never seen the puzzle put together, and we don’t know what the puzzle was supposed to look like. We know we must rebuild everything we lost, but we can’t even remember what must be rebuilt, let alone how we rebuild it.
The disease’s presence in our lives is slowly shrinking, but the reality we’ve been left with is permanent. Our experiences at Harvard will forever be split into two by a painful memory. We are different people, each scarred in a different way. Our puzzle pieces no longer fit.
This is the reality we have to grapple with — forever-changed relationships to Harvard and to each other. More bad memories than good ones. Flashbacks to March 10, 2020. Would haves and could haves and should haves. Lost opportunities.
Of course, there is so much good, too. Vibrant class discussions, the ones you keep thinking about for hours afterward. New friendships that make you smile. River sunsets so beautiful you have to take a photo, or forty. Saturdays spent exploring Boston as an unapologetic tourist. Mornings in the Yard before anyone else is awake. Hugs from friends and mentors you haven’t seen in far too long. More hugs and hellos and see you tomorrows because those things are possible now. So much laughter. So much happiness.
But until we acknowledge that we can’t come back to our 2019 campus and neatly pick up where we left off, we won’t be able to fully enjoy our return.
So let’s talk about it. Let’s talk about how much it hurts to be asked for directions on campus and not know where anything is, because yes, we’re juniors, and we should know these things, but we’ve only been on campus for six months. Let’s talk about how much it hurts to walk past former classmates and professors and not even recognize them, because you’ve never seen them in person before. Let’s talk about missed dining hall conversations and missed class discussions and missed walks through the Square and missed sunrises over the Charles.
Let’s talk about just how fragile our Harvard experiences feel, and how traumatized we all are, and how we might even blame Harvard itself for some of those feelings. Let’s talk about our year that wasn’t.
And maybe, just maybe, those puzzle pieces will slowly rearrange to create an even more beautiful image — one of trauma and triumph, of devastation and optimism, of loss and possibility, of isolation and belonging, of leaving and finally — finally — returning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only thirty steps separate you from the front door of Widener Library, although it seems like so many more as you look up at the building. Looming over Tercentenary Theater, Widener is a hulking, more than a century-old presence that exudes an air of endurance — you can almost feel the building’s age when you’re inside.
Those thirty steps carry extra meaning this fall; many students have long-awaited their return to Harvard’s flagship library — in many ways the center of our campus — since March of 2020.
Emerging from a tragedy, Widener’s endurance is a constant throughout much of Harvard’s modern history. After the Titanic sank in 1912, taking book collector Harry Elkins Widener, Class of 1907, with it, Elkins Widener’s mother Eleanor donated $2 million to Harvard to build a library in memory of her late son. Widener Library — which actually bears the full name of the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library — emerged in 1915 as Harvard’s premier library that houses almost 3.5 million books throughout its cavernous depths.
Widener is a force unto itself, and the students it serves can recognize this. As Elliott Detjen ’24 put it in an interview, “the library, with its centrality on the Yard, commands a certain kind of presence.”
During my first-ever visit to Widener in August, I was impressed by the grandeur of the building that contrasted with the function of the space itself. Widener’s primary function of housing books and circulating materials is set against a backdrop of marble and murals, the often non-flashy action of combing through text to do research and completing problem sets seemingly elevated to the status of art. After all, the inside of Widener bears a striking resemblance to the inside of an art museum, both places replete with old paintings and busts of individuals long gone. Walking through the stacks, I was amazed at how the corridors weaved into labyrinths, fascinated by the sheer number of books that surrounded me, and awed by how old some of them seemed to be.
The study carrels in the stacks don’t exude the same opulence as the rest of the library, but their complexity is in the way they exist as mini-homes for thesis and dissertation writers. As I passed by these carrels, I couldn’t help but notice all the items that were left by the carrels’ users — things like cutlery, toothpaste, blankets, and even rock crystals. Perhaps these items were remnants from March 2020, items left behind by those who were still working on their theses in Widener's carrels when the pandemic shut the library’s doors. The scene was an eerie parallel to Pompeii: I stood surrounded by the microcosmic worlds that the study carrel users had built for themselves, yet with these individuals invisible.
Widener continues to watch the inflow and outflow of students it has seen for over a hundred years, watching one graduating class be replaced by an entering one. For many sophomores, in particular, entering Widener represents a much-desired introduction to campus after missing out on the foundational experience that is getting lost in the library’s corridors and stacks during freshman year.
For Shraddha Joshi ’24, finally being able to go into Widener after a year was reaffirming.
“Having been off of campus for the entire last year, that physical space of being able to go somewhere to study, and particularly being able to go to Widener, I think it's very grounding because it reminds me that I go to Harvard and that I have access to all this wealth of knowledge,” Joshi said in an interview.
Detjen said he saw Widener as a connection to Harvard’s history: “I like the feeling that I'm almost studying among the ranks of several generations of Harvard students who have shared the same space that I have.” Evidence of these generations sits in the carrels themselves.
The seniors — who are about to leave Widener behind in a few short months — have both memories to look back on and memories yet to be created. Noah Dasanaike ’22, a former Crimson Editorial editor, talked about his memories of sitting on Widener’s ledges with friends.
“Since I was a freshman, my friends and I sort of just sat there and just talked to each other, eating Jefe’s together, for long periods of time. My friends then that I did that with are the friends that I still do that with today,” Dasanaike said.
After a year of campus closure, it’s important that we keep the atmosphere of community created by shared experiences, shared spaces, alive. Widener has endured through more than a century — may our ability to keep coming back to Widener, to keep making connections and friends on its steps and in its hallways also endure.
A shared space is special so long as it is actually shared, actually lived and existed in. Next time you feel the urge to study or want to lose yourself in a labyrinth, go to Widener and feel the presence of those next to you and those before you. May you find community as you get lost in the stacks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Class of 2025 is unsurprisingly, disproportionately wealthy, just like every class before it. According to The Crimson’s annual freshman survey, over a quarter of Harvard freshmen come from families that are wealthier than 94 percent of Americans. Nearly half have parents that make double the U.S average. This isn’t exactly shocking when we think of the extracurriculars that Harvard admits load their resumes with — starting a company, publishing novels, competing in national research competitions. Flashy but often unpaid high school internships.
Though not every student comes in with these credentials, it’s clear that the Harvard admissions process rewards shows of excellence for which wealth is often a prerequisite. This reality makes the additional boost legacy applicants get in Harvard’s admissions process particularly glaring. In its admissions FAQ, Harvard concedes that among “similarly distinguished applicants, the daughters and sons of Harvard College alumni/ae may receive an additional look.” This extra look (which, as we have continuously opined, needs abolishing) dials up the advantage of the advantaged in a highly competitive process only growing more exclusive.
This isn't a fringe issue. Legacy admits make up 15.5 percent of the Class of 2025, and they tend to be loaded: Nearly a third have parents that make half a million dollars. These students don’t deserve our ire for being rich, but, in an admissions process where wealth and a guiding hand helps plenty, it’s egregious that the College goes out of its way to privilege students who enter the rat race with a parent who can expertly aid them and likely finance experiences that showcase their child’s prowess.
Harvard’s first-generation, low-income applicants have hurdles to jump over that their wealthier counterparts simply don’t. Yet the fiscal acrobatics don't stop after acceptance. The chasm along class lines on campus is very present. To some extent, Harvard engineers it by privileging legacies and proxies of wealth, then admirably courting low-income students through its generous full financial aid initiative.
Harvard students can and should do their part to make groups on campus more financially inclusive by being cognizant of the many price tags that Harvard spaces hold. But the burden of improving the socioeconomic divide on campus falls upon the Harvard administration.
Harvard pumps an admirable amount of money into the hands of low-income freshmen through its various start-up grants. But the very nature of these grants means funds are being disbursed to students likely unaccustomed to handling large sums of money. Harvard should craft programming to walk freshmen on financial aid through what to prioritize buying, how much to save, and how to prolong the initial cash injection freshmen are granted — especially since support tapers off steeply after freshman year.
Students, per usual, have led the charge in bridging the gap between students from disparate economic backgrounds. Undergraduates fought to implement, then institutionalize, a program to acclimate disadvantaged pre-frosh to Harvard: the First-Year Retreat and Experience. During the two years FYRE was piloted in person, it was only a three-day program — among the shortest duration of any of Harvard’s pre-orientation programs, and a far cry from the five and seven-week summer programs Yale and Princeton have, respectively, to serve the same purpose. The time before freshmen arrive on campus is a critical juncture, and easing disadvantaged students into Harvard’s economically stratified ecosystem is the lord’s work. Harvard’s support of FYRE should reflect it.
In order for students to take advantage of the equalizing funds Harvard offers, they need to know they exist. Unfortunately, they’re miserably decentralized. There’s the Beneficiary Aid Scholarship which covers unforeseeable, one-time medical expenses for students on scholarship. The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which offers a full-ride to students from families making under $65,000 has multiple grants: the Harvard winter coat fund, the Harvard start-up grant ($2,000 for freshmen on full aid to spend as they wish), and the Student Events Fund for five free campus event tickets. For those in need of technology, the First-Year Outside Award Computer Reimbursement reimburses those with outside scholarships the cost for a computer.
All of these initiatives are admirable attempts to bridge the socioeconomic divide on our campus. Hopefully, their existence makes students from low-income backgrounds less daunted by the fact that our campus skews so wealthy. But a generous splattering of grants doesn’t absolve Harvard of actively rewarding the students of legacies and donors in its admissions process, nor does it erase the need for the University to bolster the resources it offers low-income students acclimating to our dizzying, divided environment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning to in-person classes, rehearsals, and performances this month following a long hiatus, musicians at Harvard said they are encountering new challenges complying with the University’s Covid-19 guidelines.
The Music Department is following Harvard’s official guidelines for distancing and masking indoors, according to an email from Music Department Chair and Professor of African American Music Ingrid T. Monson.
Andrew G. Clark, the director of choral activities at the College who teaches a performance-based cantata course, said he and his students have been using an adapted singing mask that optimizes sound and prevents inhalation of the mask during vigorous singing.
“We’ve been providing them for the students, and we’re getting support from the Office for the Arts and the Music department,” he said. “The College has been really quite supportive in providing what we need across the board.”
Other faculty members have encountered difficulties, however, with finding masks and other personal protective equipment for their students. Mark E. Olson, the director of the Harvard Band and Wind Ensemble, said slotted masks and bell covers are tricky to obtain for woodwind and brass players.
“You simply need to have a mask that is as close to your face as possible but allows you to be able to insert the mouthpiece,” Olson said.
“We’re still researching and getting better masks that allow us to perform and keep us safe,” he added. “They’re out there, but there’s a high demand for masks and low supply, because all the bands in the area and colleges, everybody’s ordering masks.”
Ruben A. Fonseca ’24, a percussionist in the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra, said HRO has not yet been able to rehearse as a full group due to a lack of bell covers despite the fact that their first performance is only eight rehearsals away.
“We’re a strong enough group that it should be fine,” Fonesca said. “But it just sucks that we haven’t been able to meet as a full group because of those restrictions.”
Bell covers provide an extra level of protection against Covid-19 but can compromise the quality of an instrument’s sound. A euphonium player in the wind ensemble had intonation problems that were only solved when he took off his bell cover, Olsen said.
“For instance, a euphonium player – we discovered this last week – as he started going in the upper register notes, the intubation pitch was off,” he said. “And I said, ‘Pull the bell cover off and let’s play,’ and they didn’t get any problems with intonation.”
Gabriel U. Ortiz ’24, a trumpet player in HRO, said his Harvard bell cover has yet to arrive, but he has used the protective equipment in the past.
“I think it dulls the sound,” he said. “I feel like my sound doesn’t shimmer, it kind of dulls the edge of the brass sound.”
Despite the new challenges, Clark said extra precautions are worth it compared to the struggle of making music online.
“Taking any precautions to make it possible to sing together is worth it, because making music, especially choral music and vocal music on Zoom, can really just be a dehumanizing and disappointing experience,” he said. “I think we want to do everything we can to do our part to never have to go back to Zoom choir.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates rallied in support of shopping week in Science Center Plaza Tuesday afternoon, waving signs and distributing fliers that read “Save Shopping Week” and “Stop Course Preview Period” to students filing out of their classes.
The rally came on the first day of voting in an Undergraduate Council referendum on shopping week, the traditional period in which undergraduates can browse courses for a week before officially enrolling. It also coincided with a Tuesday vote by a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee on a proposal to eliminate next semester’s shopping week over public health concerns, which would mark the fourth consecutive semester with early registration instead.
Some faculty and graduate students have pushed to eliminate shopping week permanently, arguing that it creates planning challenges and uncertainty for student workers. A separate FAS committee is scheduled to issue a recommendation on course registration reforms in the spring.
Shreya P. Nair ’24, a UC member who helped organize the rally, said although the pandemic provided Harvard with a “really nice excuse” to get rid of shopping week, it was important to organize in support of the long-standing tradition.
“It can cause administrative headaches, but students really enjoy it,” Nair said. “It provides students with the ability to really explore their intellectual curiosity, not having to take only classes that explore what they’re going to concentrate in or what they’re thinking of doing as a career.”
Freshmen and sophomores made up many of those rallying in the Plaza Tuesday. Nair said the UC and advocates have focused their outreach toward freshmen and sophomores, who have never experienced a shopping week.
“[Harvard is] counting on freshmen and sophomores to be disengaged, to not care about shopping because they’ve never experienced it,” Nair said. “They’ve never seen how lovely it can be, especially compared to course preview period.”
Adrienne L. Chan ’25, who participated in the rally, said she sees the potential loss of shopping week as an issue of “equity.”
“You’re presuming that students that are coming into the College already know what courses to take, how to do it, have access to the technology to get to my.Harvard, and do their course registration,” Chan said. “It’s just very presumptuous, and honestly, incredibly inaccessible.”
Sanjna Kedia ’25 said she joined the rally because she feels the lack of a shopping week this fall made it difficult for her to find classes that were the best fit.
“Personally, I had to switch half my schedule just a week in. And I do think that that wouldn’t have happened if I did have access to shopping week because it would have given me the opportunity to try out the classes I wasn’t that into,” Kedia said.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the rally.
The rally and other recent advocacy in support of shopping week has drawn support from not only undergrads, but also graduate students, alumni, and professors, according to Nair.
“We’ve also talked to a lot of alumni out here who just live in the area, especially older alumni, who are absolutely flabbergasted that Harvard has even thought of this as an option during Covid,” Nair said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With most classes two weeks underway, students at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences say they have mostly adapted to their elongated commute to Harvard’s new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston.
Commuting from places as far as the Quad by bike, bus, or foot, many SEAS students reported that, despite some transit hitches, they have adjusted to the trip across the Charles River.
Pforzheimer House resident Harini S. Kannan ’24, who has one class and does research in the SEC, said she has not had many complaints about commuting since classes started.
“It’s been much better once I started building a schedule, or just getting a little bit more familiar with [commuting],” she said. “Because I have a 9 a.m. class on Mondays and Wednesdays, I usually come to the Yard for that class, and then after that I leave for the SEC.”
Unlike Kannan, Cabot House resident Amy L. Nichols ’23 said she has to trek on foot to the SEC for occasional lab work on weekends when the Quad-SEC shuttle does not run.
Otherwise, Nichols rides the shuttle on weekdays but said she worries about how winter will treat the walking commute from the Quad.
“I’m pretending like it’s not going to snow,” Nichols added. “I don’t really know what I am going to do then.”
Annabel M. Cho ’23, a bioengineering concentrator, said she initially thought she would get a scooter to quicken the trip.
“When I found out how far the SEC building was, I originally scrambled to try to find an electric scooter,” Cho said. “My friends and I were joking: the engineering students will be the new athletes with the scooters.”
She said she decided on purchasing a membership, discounted through Harvard, to Bluebikes — a Boston area bike-sharing system with several stations around campus.
Cho described Harvard’s shuttles as “a little unpredictable” and as motivation to bike instead.
Physics concentrator Aayush Karan ’23 called the shuttles a “godsend,” with no complaints.
Harvard Campus Services added a new Quad-SEC Direct shuttle route and a new SEC bus stop on the Allston Loop shuttle this semester to accommodate SEAS affiliates. But in the first week of the semester, many students reported crowded shuttles, long wait times, and inconsistent arrival times on the shuttle app.
Fouzia Raza ’23 said she frequently walks from Mather House to the SEC “on a good day,” but when she has taken the shuttle, she said she noticed shuttle congestion improved since the first day of classes.
Raza added that she appreciated having some office hours at the SEC rather than back in Cambridge.
“For the first week, we had office hours mostly in the SEC, and that was actually pretty convenient, considering that I could just stay after class,” she said. “But now since most people are switching over to having office hours in Cambridge, I think that commute actually is more annoying.”
Cho also noted she and some teaching fellows were reluctant to have office hours at the SEC due to the distance.
“A few TFs also don’t want to do their office hours in the SEC,” she said. “It’s felt a little funny that we have this new building, but then they’re just having their meetings on Zoom anyways.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With long lines outside El Jefe’s Taqueria, packed final club courtyards, and picnics scattered along the Charles River, Harvard’s social scene has resurrected.
A year ago, campus was barren. But the return of all undergraduates to Harvard’s dorms this fall, provided they are vaccinated, has brought back college social life.
Covid-19 is not an issue of the past on campus, though. The College is enforcing Covid-19 protocols, including an indoor mask mandate, frequent testing, and a limit on students gathering in dorms. While some students said they are eager to have the social life they envisioned before the pandemic’s onset, others are treading carefully, according to interviews with more than a dozen undergraduates.
“We understand coming here that it’s still important to respect and prioritize the safety of some of our peers who are immunocompromised or some individuals who weren’t able to get vaccinated for a medical reason, for instance,” Lucy Tu ’24 said. “Same time, I also understand the perspective of students wanting to socialize after so long in isolation.”
This fall, Tu said she has enjoyed casual hangouts in her friends’ dorm rooms, which was not possible under last year’s Covid restrictions on campus.
“I will just go to my friend’s dorm, like their common room in their suite, and we sit and we talk,” Tu said. “Which is something that we couldn’t do our freshman fall ’cause it was technically illegal.”
Nicole J. Bugliosi ’24 said student clubs have adapted their events by holding gatherings along the Charles River. As a leader for the First-Year Outdoor Program, she has gone on picnics.
Matthew Chang ’22-’23 said he believes Harvard students are socializing in smaller groups and venturing off campus more this fall.
“I think a lot of people maybe are partying with people who are closer to them, like having a smaller event, maybe drinking with some blockmates,” Chang said. “A lot of people are going to bars.”
After more than a year of isolation, Jason Oh ’22-’23 said people seem eager to party.
“I’ve been to Felipe’s rooftop bar a couple weeks ago. It’s packed. I think since everyone’s been remote for the past year, everyone wants to get back to that social life,” he said. “I’ve been to a few [final club] events, and I see a lot of people there as well.”
“There were probably almost over 100 people in that one backyard,” Oh added.
Some students said campus is radically different from last year, when students on campus were subject to strict Covid-19 restrictions. Christine W. Maina ’24 said she has enjoyed seeing a different side of Harvard Square.
“Going out for dinner is something that we really couldn’t do last year,” she said. “Last year, it felt really dead.”
Madeline D. Kidd ’24 said in-person learning and dining has facilitated friendships in a way that virtual Harvard did not.
“In just the first week that we were here before classes, I probably made more friends than I did in the entirety of last year,” she said.
Michael J. Moorman ’25 said campus health guidelines have not dampened the start to his college experience, which has included dining in Annenberg Hall and the First Chance Dance.
“It feels sort of as though college is going on as normal,” Moorman said. “I wouldn’t say there’s anything about my experience that is unusual for a college freshman.”
Though they are finding ways to socialize, some students said they remain vigilant against the coronavirus.
Sherry X. Liu ’24 said she considers the health of those around her when making social plans.
“There are certain events that I personally have turned down just because, for example, some people that I live with are higher risk if they were to get Covid,” Liu said.
Other students said they do not believe large-scale gatherings are imprudent.
“With such a high proportion of vaccinated students, faculty, and graduate students, etc., I don’t really think it’s a big deal,” Moorman said.
As students reunite with friends and meet new ones for the first time, the specter of March 2020 — when Harvard sent students home and shifted learning online — looms large.
“One thing I really don’t want to happen is limiting in-person classes,” Chang said. “I would be fine not going to any party the rest of the semester, just so I could have class, and I really wish more people thought like that.”
“But I guess people want to have fun. It’s college,” Chang added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the MIT School of Science Nergis Mavalvala – one of the astrophysicists who first directly detected gravitational waves – gave a lecture on the scientific history of gravitational waves Tuesday at an event hosted by Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
The lecture, called “Gravitational Waves: A New Window to the Universe,” was part of Radcliffe’s annual Kim and Judy Davis Dean’s Lecture in the Sciences series.
Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin kicked off the lecture with her own perspective on the groundbreaking discovery, which came in 2015.
Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time caused by high-energy cosmic events like the merging of black holes. Even though scientists like Albert Einstein theorized about gravitational waves as early as 1916, they dismissed them as very faint and therefore undetectable.
“Indeed, our desire for new and deeper understanding has driven path-breaking discoveries throughout history,” Brown-Nagin said. “Few subjects have captured our curiosity more than the cosmos itself.”
Mavalvala explained at the start of her lecture that before the discovery of gravitational waves, astrophysicists relied on light, which she referred to as a “natural messenger,” to study the universe.
However, while working with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which has locations in Livingston, La. and Hanford, Wash., Mavalvala and her colleagues detected gravitational waves for the first time.
During Tuesday’s lecture, which took place on Zoom, Mavalvala described her and her colleagues’ methodology.
“The L in LIGO stands for laser. It is the light source that made it possible,” she said. “When you’re trying to make a really precise measurement, you need a really, really good ruler.”
The detectors consisted of four-kilometer long tunnels with extremely precise lasers and mirrors that constantly searched for a signal from a gravitational wave rippling through space, she said.
“If you had a really precise clock you measure the light travel time, and if a gravitational wave comes through, that light travel time would change because the gravitational wave is shrinking and stretching the space between the laser and the mirror,” Mavalvala explained.
Upon first seeing the signal in September 2015, Mavalvala and her colleagues were in disbelief. According to Mavalvala, they shook their heads and said, “No, that can’t be real.” Their historical observation, she said, was “as beautiful as the astrophysical story because it has made us confront the smallest, most fundamental forces in nature at the quantum level.”
Despite the groundbreaking success achieved by Mavalvala and her team, they faced challenges, Mavalvala said in an interview after the lecture.
“When you’re trying to do something of this precision that’s never been done before, there’s almost nothing you can just buy off the shelf,” she said. “We had to invent solutions for just about every technology that we used.”
Mavalvala stressed that scientific achievements should not end conversations but should in fact start new ones.
“We’ve turned on this completely new way to sense the universe, but this moment in history won’t be remembered for these particular discoveries but for the paradigm shift where we can now use gravity alone or gravity with light as a new tool for unimagined discovery,” she said during the lecture.
Currently, Mavalvala and her team are trying to improve how astrophysicists detect gravitational waves through using a quantum light source instead of an ordinary laser.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend saw Harvard women’s volleyball compete in the Northeastern Tournament, the middle trio of the Crimson’s non-conference slate before Ivy League play begins on Sept. 24 at Dartmouth. The Crimson rallied from straight-set losses to Bryant University (5-5, 0-0 NEC) and Villanova University (6-3, 0-0 Big East) to win two sets in a narrow defeat to the tournament hosts, who improved to 4-6 (0-0 CAA) with the win. Harvard’s three setbacks dropped the team’s record to 1-5 as it prepares for the Howard Invitational on Sept. 17-18 in Washington, D.C.
HARVARD 2, NORTHEASTERN 3
The Huskies came out roaring in the first set, winning the first six points of the match behind a pair of kills from Rafaella Lepenioti. They stretched their lead to 10-2 following another kill from Erica Staunton, who would go on to lead Northeastern with 15. From that point, Harvard staged a mini-rally, winning six of the next eight points on the strength of three kills by sophomore middle blocker Ariana White to pull within three points. From that point, the teams traded blows until a Marika Virthe kill secured the set for Northeastern, 25-20. After the Huskies’ opening 10-2 run, Harvard demonstrated its tenacity, outscoring Northeastern 18-15 for the remainder of the first set.
Junior captain Jaimie Rao, a right side attacker from Toronto, Ont., credited the team’s first set rally for their second and third set victories.
“We found our groove as a team and cultivated a competitive energy that had previously been lacking. We knew that the way we started the first set was not Harvard volleyball and played well throughout the rest of the game,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The second set victory continued the weekend-long trend of success above the net, as Harvard recorded more kills than both Northeastern and Villanova despite the losses. In the second set alone, the Crimson racked up 19 kills to take the set 26-24. None was more crucial than Rao’s finish of sophomore setter Ashley Wang’s pass with the score knotted at 24; the momentum-shifting kill increased the team’s energy and helped first-year setter Rocky Aguirre finish off the game with an ace.
“Winning is the ultimate goal, and the excitement I saw in my teammates' faces from that point really meant a lot to me. I rotated off after that swing, but I knew with the energy and momentum we gained from it that my team was about to win this set,” Rao wrote.
The Crimson rode the momentum of Aguirre’s ace into the third set, taking advantage of a few Huskies errors to race out to an early 5-0 lead. From there, Harvard held the tournament hosts at bay for a while, taking an 18-12 lead with another of Rao’s career-high 22 kills. Northeastern battled back, though, claiming seven of the next eight points to tie the score at 19 apiece. Despite the scare, Wang’s kill shifted the momentum back in Harvard’s favor as it went on to win the set, 25-21.
The fourth set was defined by yet another mid-set Huskies run. After a Crimson rally to tie the set with six points apiece, Northeastern, buoyed by the substitutions of Sara Kent and Staunton, went on an 8-2 run to open up a 14-8 lead. From there, they held Harvard at bay, never letting the Crimson within three points on their way to a 25-18 victory.
The deciding fifth set was back and forth from the start, with the teams splitting the first ten points. Harvard eventually broke through to hold the first two-point lead of the set on a block by Wang and sophomore middle blocker Ava Rauser. But the Huskies stormed back, winning the next four points behind a block and two kills from Lepenioti to open up a two-point lead of their own. The Crimson was unable to make up the deficit, and Staunton eventually put down a Liz Carroll set to close out the final stanza, 15-12.
Despite their third loss of the weekend, Rao was proud of the Crimson’s effort.
“We had multiple players step up and make a huge impact on the court,” she wrote. “We have shown that when every part of our game is playing at its potential, we are a total force to be reckoned with. … We all had a year away from the sport, and half of our roster is entirely new to the team. … I'm so proud of the tenacity we have shown, and each time we step on the court, I see a growth in confidence and killer instinct.”
Rao’s 22 kills led the Crimson, while Rauser (two aces) tied Wang, who ranked in the top ten nationally after the Harvard Invitational in aces per set with 0.75. White blocked 7 of the Huskies’ kill attempts, while first-year libero Lindsey Zhang recorded 22 digs. Wang also managed 28 assists in the first triple-double of her career (28 assists, 13 digs, and 10 kills).
HARVARD 0, VILLANOVA 3
In the first set, the Crimson got off to a hot start, taking advantage of a few Villanova errors to win the first three points of the match. The teams then traded blows as Harvard maintained its three-point advantage as late as 7-10, when a missed serve by first-year outside hitter Corinne Furey initiated a 7-1 Wildcat run, leading head coach Jennifer Weiss to call a timeout. She was unable to resettle her team, however, as Villanova came out of the timeout still smoldering, quickly winning three more points behind kills from Riley Homer to open up a 17-12 lead. Homer continued to torment the Crimson; after a kill by sophomore middle hitter Olivia Cooper tied the score at 20-20, Homer put away three balls to open up a lead that the Wildcats would not surrender. It was none other than Homer who ultimately hammered the nail in the Crimson’s coffin, combining with Kiera Booth to stuff Wang’s kill attempt and claim the set, 25-21.
Villanova’s momentum carried over into the second set as the squad took an early 5-0 lead behind a slew of Crimson errors. The Wildcats stretched their early lead to 9-2 as Harvard struggled to win consecutive points. Harvard did eventually manage to curb some of Villanova’s momentum, splitting the next 24 points as the teams went back and forth. But a kill by Madeline Barber opened up the Wildcats’ lead to a set-high eight points, affording them the cushion to weather even a 6-0 Harvard run featuring two kills from Rao and two more from Furey. Ultimately, the Crimson’s valiant rally fell short, as an Averi Salvador service ace closed out the set in the Wildcats’ favor, 25-21.
The third set closely mirrored the second, with the Wildcats racing out to an early 6-2 lead behind three Harvard errors. After the Crimson closed the margin to 12-10, Villanova went on another mini-run behind three kills from Booth, stretching its lead to 17-11. However, down to its last five points at 20-14, Harvard stole the momentum back and went on a run, with Aguirre notching three aces before Wang’s kill gave the Crimson the lead at 21-20. Harvard would hold the lead as late as 23-22, but the Wildcats again stepped up in crucial moments, with Homer putting away a ball to claim the straight-sets victory, 25-23.
Despite the loss, Harvard managed to record 45 kills to outpace Villanova’s 35. The Crimson also blocked three more shots than the Wildcats. Rao mentioned these two significant statistical victories as positive indicators that Harvard can take out of the weekend’s games.
“Our setters ran a great offense this weekend and we have so many terminal hitters. We also have worked a lot on blocking techniques in practice, and our coaches laid out a thorough scouting report on our opponents. All of the preparation we had prior to the match allowed us to score the way that we did,” she wrote.
Rao’s nine kills paced the Crimson, while Aguirre’s run of three aces was enough to lead the team. Meanwhile, Wang managed 14 assists and Zhang 15 digs. Cooper turned in a career-best game above the net with her team-high four blocks.
HARVARD 0, BRYANT 3
A late run was enough for Bryant to win the first set, a competitive affair filled with dramatic momentum swings. The Bulldogs started hot, jumping out to an early 6-2 advantage. This four-point cushion held for a while until the teams started trading streaks. A Haley O’Brien kill extended Bryant’s lead to 15-11 before Harvard managed to rattle off five consecutive points to storm back and claim its first lead of the match at 16-15. Each team then went on 3-0 mini-runs as the Crimson staked out a 19-18 edge. However, Bryant broke the game wide open, winning six consecutive points to push Harvard to the brink at 24-19. The Crimson was unable to answer, as a Riley James kill was enough to win the first set for Bryant, 25-20.
The Bulldogs came out of the gate snarling in the second set, claiming four of the first five points by taking advantage of a few attack errors by Harvard. Throughout the set, the Crimson struggled to gain momentum, failing to win three consecutive points until a small run behind the strength of two kills from Wang narrowed the deficit to 18-20. Harvard was unable to take advantage, though; an attack error shifted momentum back in Bryant’s favor, and the Bulldogs ultimately claimed the set, 25-21, after a Caroline Kennedy kill.
In the third set, it was Harvard who came out strong, eking out a narrow edge before two kills by Furey extended the lead to 5-2. The Crimson held its advantage for much of the set as a slew of Bryant errors allowed Harvard to take an 11-6 lead. The Bulldogs fought back to tie the set at 13 points apiece, but the Crimson quickly regained its edge, managing a 5-1 run to regain a four-point edge on Wang’s kill. Faced with the pressure of a potential fourth set, Bryant snatched back the momentum, with its formidable front line recording four kills and blocking Rao’s attempt to claim its first lead of the set at 22-21. Although the Crimson fought back to knot up the score again at 23-23, Bryant won the last two points of the match behind two Harvard errors to close out the match, 25-23.
Wang recorded 12 kills and four blocks, while Aguirre’s two aces, 11 assists, and 12 digs were enough to pace the team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, Sept. 11, Harvard cross country took on Ivy League rivals Princeton and Yale at the Tigers’ home course in New Jersey. Amidst steep competition, the Crimson men placed first in their 8k race, edging Princeton by one point, with the women placing second, falling just short of the Tigers in their 4.8k race.
The sunny Saturday morning was not without drama for both the men and the women in the early season action. In his first race as a Harvard first-year, Graham Blanks flew out in front of the rest of the pack, building a substantial gap over the other competitors. Due to an error from the officiating staff, Blanks ran off the course near the end of the race, losing his lead before finding the course again. Despite the unfortunate mistake, Blanks still finished third overall with a time of 23:41, a sensational debut for the freshman.
“Our takeaways from the race were definitely all positive ones. We know where our competition stands and that we can compete well early in the season when training intensity is still fairly high,” junior co-captain David Melville said. “We had a huge breakthrough with a few members of the team which weren’t surprising to us but likely were to other teams, which was really fun to see.”
Despite a larger turnout than the Short Course Invitational a week ago, the Crimson men still have many runners who will not make their first appearances until the Battle of the Beantown on Sept. 24. First-years like Blanks are largely unknown runners who have never competed at the college level before and are often discounted in pre-season rankings. Melville and the rest of the Harvard men are looking forward to rolling out their talent and surprising nationally recognized teams with the strength of their roster.
In addition to Blanks, sophomore standout Acer Iverson placed second with a time of 23:40, and senior 2019 All-Ivy Second Team selection Matthew Pereira finished right behind Blanks in fourth with a time of 23:41. With junior Luke Laverdiere placing eighth and first-year Andrew Avila placing 19th, the Harvard men had a total of 36 points across their top five. Princeton’s top five finished fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, and 10th with a total of 37 points. Laverdiere finishing 8th and breaking up the top-five pack of Tigers runners was crucial to win the day and give the Crimson its one-point victory.
“Competing again as a team in the Ivy League after such a long break was interesting because nobody knew where the other team’s fitness levels were at,” said Melville about competing in the Ivy League again. “It was a fast and competitive race, so we learned a lot about our competition and where we fit compared to them. Now the focus for us is to keep our heads down and train through the mid-season until we see the rest of the Ivy League again at Heps.”
For the Harvard women, they came into the race against a nationally-ranked Princeton squad that was expected to win the race. A valiant effort by the Crimson made the race a tight one-point loss which was an exciting start to the young season.
In her final kick, sophomore runner Isabell Sagar beat out a Tiger runner for second place in the race by just 0.03 seconds with a time of 16:18. In addition, first-year Maia Ramsden finished in fifth in her debut race with a time of 16:33. This blistering pace was just in front of senior co-captain and 2019 All-Ivy First Team selection Anna Juul, who finished in eighth with a time of 16:38. The strong start to the season for Sagar and Ramsden is a testament to the depth of the Harvard women, who continue to surprise national rankings with their performances dating back to their 2019 NCAA run. Rounding out the scoring for the Crimson women is sophomore Eloise Freitag, who finished just behind Juul in ninth, and freshman Isabelle Goldstein, who finished 13th in her first race for Harvard.
“The team is definitely excited with how we performed, especially given how early it is in the season,'' senior co-captain Judy Penderdast said. “We are feeling more confident in ourselves after this race, and we are eager to see what we can do with some more training under our belt.”
As the Crimson women progress into their mid-season training, they will look to continue their development as the team gels further. Moreover, the team will look to build off of the hard work it has put in since training together last summer in Flagstaff, Ariz. Regardless of the result, both captains echoed that it was fantastic to be racing with their teammates against meaningful opponents again.
“It was so great to be back to competing in cross country after a two-year hiatus,” Pendergast commented. “Cross country is such a team sport; I think that a lot of us missed the bond you feel when you get to race alongside your teammates.”
The Harvard men and women have a two-week break before they take on a 24-team heat at the Coast-to-Coast Battle of Beantown hosted by Boston College on Friday, Sept. 24. In 2019, both Crimson squads placed fourth in the competitive event as they showed out against multiple ranked competitors. This year, the No. 28 Harvard men will be tested primarily by No. 6 Arkansas, No. 23 Duke, and a field of highly competitive Northeast region schools. The nationally unranked Harvard women will be tested by No. 13 North Carolina, No. 23 Connecticut, and No. 26 Providence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week following its first decisive win of the season against Mount Saint Mary’s, the Harvard women’s rugby team returned to Mignone Field on Saturday to face Long Island University. The Crimson dominated the game from start to finish, resulting in a lopsided final score of 109-5.
Harvard’s players entered the game excited to play higher-level rugby and continue to gel with teammates they have never played with, or have not played with in over a year and a half.
“That was something we were talking a lot about in preseason — anticipating the challenges that come with that,” said senior winger Emma Kearney, responding to the issue of time off and many new teammates. “I think the past two games we’ve all been really getting to know each other better, learning to work together, and developing relationships off the field. I would say it’s been a lot of fun.”
Within the first 20 minutes of the match, the Crimson had already racked up points on the scoreboard to establish a 25-0 lead. Harvard remained on the offensive end of the field for much of the first half as the team continued to make big defensive stops and push the ball into LIU’s endzone. Kearney, as well as senior Cassidy Bargell, sophomore Nafanua Malietoa Fitisemanu, and first-years Chloe Headland, Kiani Akina, Jara Emtage-Cave, and PK Vincze all contributed tallies to the halftime score, 68-0.
The final result showing a triple-digit score demonstrated how effectively this team can play together, even if many players are new to the team and just seeing college-level competition for the second time. First-year wing/scrumhalf Kiani Akina tallied two tries in this match, and first-years PK Vincze (flyback/fullback), Reese Morgan (scrumhalf), and Jara Emtage-Cave (lock/center) all scored their first tries of the season. First-year fullback Chloe Headland had a standout game, with her 23 points coming from six conversions, two penalty kicks, and one try.
“It is pretty surreal to be coming in as a freshman; I’m very grateful for the coaches and the players to put that amount of trust in me to have such a big role on the team,” said Headland of joining the 2019 National Championship team. “As a kicker, I'm not doing a lot of the work, they [my teammates] do most of it. So I think it's pretty special, and I'm grateful to be able to have the opportunity to add those extra points to our scoreboard.”
Overall, 12 different Harvard players contributed to the final score. As a win of over 100 points indicates, the team did not let up its intensity of play, regardless of who was on the field.
“It was really exciting to see how deep our roster is,” Kearney said. “At the end, when we were still going strong, we had a lot of new personnel on the field, and to see us kind of maintain a standard of play that we wanted to see was really exciting.”
Headland pointed to the team’s culture as the key to its immense success so early on in the season. Given the turbulent past 18 months without live game competition, building cohesion and chemistry in the first couple of games has become a major focus.
“The team culture is so incredibly supportive,” Headland said. “They [teammates] look out for each other and they make it feel like home. The seniors have really stepped up to help the new players coming in to adjust well and feel accepted and comfortable to show what they can do.”
After a bye week next weekend, the Crimson will return to the field to take on the Sacred Heart University Pioneers on Saturday, Sept. 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday night, Harvard played out a heartbreaking 2-1 extra-time loss versus Northeastern in its first game back on Jordan field since 2019. There was no shortage of action for fans in attendance, as the game featured a red card, a saved penalty, and multiple disallowed goals, but the crowd ultimately was not able to rally the Crimson to a victory.
Despite holding out for 54 minutes while down a man, Harvard (1-1-1, 0-0 Ivy) was not able to hold on for the tie against cross-town rivals Northeastern. Following an intense first period of extra time, the Huskies headed home a corner in the 103rd minute to end the match and break Crimson hearts.
Harvard was reduced to ten men early in the second half after senior forward Alfred Perez was shown a straight red card for a two-footed tackle in the 49th minute. Tempers flared following the challenge, as the Northeastern players got in the face of Perez as he pleaded his innocence, but no further action was taken by the referee, and the Crimson was down to ten players.
“We make a mistake, and we get punished for it, and then it was all about resilience and fight and grit,” coach Josh Shapiro said. “And I think our group showed a ton of that. So you know, obviously not ideal and a loss is never good, but there are things we can take from that that we feel good about.”
The game had gotten off to an uneasy start for Harvard as the Huskies nearly took the lead with only twenty seconds played. Northeastern thought it had found an early lead following a scramble at the back for the Crimson which ended with senior forward Dan Munch finishing into the bottom corner, but the goal was disallowed as the referee had called a foul just outside the box on the preceding pass. The Huskies hit the post on the ensuing freekick and had the rebound cleared off the line by first-year Crimson defender Jan Riecke, all within the opening 30 seconds.
After the game settled down, Harvard took the lead through sophomore midfielder William Ebbinge, the first goal of the season for the Queenstown, New Zealand, native. Ebbinge shot from just inside the corner of the box after being played in by senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik, with his shot squeezing through the arms of Northeastern’s goalkeeper and into the back of the net to put the Crimson up 1-0.
The pace of the game changed following the red card, as what had been an end-to-end affair became more lopsided. Harvard dropped into a more defensive shape and tried to break on the counter as the Huskies took the lion’s share of possession. Despite sitting back, the Crimson remained dangerous, registering four shots in the second half, two of which were on target.
Northeastern eventually took advantage of its numerical superiority, leveling the game in the 63rd minute. Senior forward Benjamin Klingen picked up the ball at the edge of the box before turning, cutting inside, and firing into the far corner to level the game at 1-1.
The game was almost decided in the 90 minutes of regulation as the Huskies were awarded a controversial penalty kick in the 87th minute. Northeastern crossed a ball from wide which hit senior defender Fernando Docters in the arm, who was standing just inside the box on the endline. Harvard players immediately mobbed the referee, as the arm seemed to be in a natural position, but he would hear no appeals on the call.
The referee had to check with the linesman to confirm Docters was in the box, but the call stood, and the Huskies had a chance to end the game in regulation. Junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson had other plans though, as he came up with a strong save on his right side to keep the Crimson in the game and continue his great run of form.
Despite the heroics of Nilsson and the boost Harvard gained from it, the Crimson could not hold on for 20 minutes of extra time, eventually falling in the 103rd minute to a powerful header from a corner.
“If you’re able to steal a draw there, then there's so much resilience to gain from that. But regardless, we hung on for 54 minutes in a really difficult situation,” coach Josh Shapiro said. “There's a lot of positives we have to be able to take away from this. This is gonna hurt, it should hurt, when you lose a game like this, when you've left it all on the line. At the same time, I think there are things we can take from it.”
Harvard heads back on the road for its next time out, facing Quinnipiac in Hampden, Conn., on Saturday at 2 p.m.

So, I could write a letter directly to Dunster’s Plums, but that wouldn’t be useful to you. And you — a Harvard student sitting in lecture while comping seven clubs while debating a situationship while double-fisting compostable paper cups while, apparently, reading the latest Flyby masterpiece — you only like things that are useful.
Moving from home to campus has been challenging, yes, but by far the most challenging part has been the absence of fruit. “What about bananas?” you foolishly ask. Try eating five bananas a day, thinking you’re getting your daily serving of fruit, and get back to me. Still like bananas? Yeah, I thought so. Totally not speaking from experience here.
Anyway, back to the Plums. Sure, other houses have plums. But they don’t have Dunster’s Plums. Dunster’s Plums are SO GOOD. Like, they’re washed good. Perched on the top of the fruit display, where they rightfully belong, the Plums demand your attention in a way your untouched p-set could never.
To get your hands on God’s greatest creation, I’d recommend bringing a large bag and the fruit-picking skills your Taiwanese parents instilled in you. Everyone knows that plums in your backpack is a sticky situation — stickier than that time you waited for the SEAS shuttle, only to have to Uber to class when the shuttle didn’t show up :) :) :). Hence, the bag. If you’re not expecting to get enough Plums to warrant a large bag, sorry but gtfo.
You might be wondering, Ariana, if you love the Plums so much, why would you advertise it, thus limiting your personal supply of Plums? Good question, and I’m glad you’re learning a lot in Ec10A. The thing is, while you may be a Harvard student sitting in lecture while comping seven clubs while debating a situationship while double-fisting compostable paper cups while, apparently, reading the latest Flyby masterpiece — you’re still too lazy to walk to Dunster to get Plums. ;)
To conclude, I’d like to thank the housing gods for placing me in Leverett — it’s like a minute away from Dunster’s Plums. For any fellow Dunster Plum enthusiasts, please email ariana.chiu@thecrimson.com so we can totally, like, grab some Plums together sometime.
With love, in sickness and in health,
Ariana
