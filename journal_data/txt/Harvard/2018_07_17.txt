After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hal’s grandparents had been dead for more than twenty years,” so Hal is surprised when she receives a letter stating that her alleged grandmother, Hester Westaway, has recently passed and left her a substantial inheritance. Instead of telling the truth, that she has never heard of a Hester Westaway, Hal hops on a train to Penzance to claim her portion of the inheritance. Along with this family mystery, Ruth Ware succeeds in creating a creepy and gothic atmosphere in her latest novel, “The Death of Mrs. Westaway.” But despite the intrigue and a spooky mansion, this thriller, unfortunately, lacks a final thrill.
Unlike many recent popular thrillers with female narrators—such as “The Girl on the Train” and “The Woman in the Window”—Hal is fairly likeable and diverges from common thriller tropes. Hal stands up for herself often. She lacks information not because her mind is clouded by alcohol or drug abuse, but because her mother never spoke about her family. Hal is a tarot card reader, like her mother, and neither of them believe the cards have anything to do with fate. Hal uses her skills of reading people in order to understand the drama unfolding among the three sons of Hester Westaway, her “uncles.” At first she has no qualms about playing the part. After all, these men are wealthy enough as it is and Hal is being threatened by a loan shark, making the diversion seem “somehow rather gallant, [with] a touch of Robin Hood about the whole thing.” But Hal soon feels guilty once her “uncles” begin to treat her like the niece she is pretending to be. Hal’s survivor attitude and her compassion make it easy to cheer for her, and it is refreshing to have a female narrator of a thriller that isn’t standing in her own way of success.
Ware has chosen an excellent setting for a creepy family drama: The mansion in Penzance, once grand and stately, is now old, dusty, and creaky. The strange and elderly housekeeper has put Hal in the attic with “a metal bedstead in one corner, a washtand in the other, and a barred nursery window overlooking the garden.” As if barred windows in the attic aren’t scary enough, Hal soon finds “HELP ME” etched into the glass of the window in tiny, cramped writing. The attic, a run-down mansion, and a sinister old housekeeper are all ingredients for a chilling gothic thriller, but Ware makes sure not to let her novel slip into the clichés of the genre.
Besides the setting, Ware often manipulates her descriptions of the mundane moments to keep up the suspense. The thought of having to speak with the lawyer about the will is “like a noose around Hal’s neck, not yet tight, but slowly tightening, and already making it hard to breathe.” Such writing keeps the spark of suspense alive even during the slower moments of the novel.
Unfortunately, the ending of the novel (arguably the most important part of a thriller) falls flat. Much of the final reveal is predictable, and doesn’t fill the book’s plot holes. The parts that were surprising lacked an appropriate motive. Even after the conclusion is revealed, the reader is left wondering why these characters acted this way to begin with.
The disappointing ending is unfortunate, because Ware is a gifted writer who can evidently create wonderfully spooky atmospheres within her books. The narrator is interesting and refreshing and the premise is intriguing. Despite its faults, “The Death of Mrs. Westaway” has some redeeming qualities.

Debut novelist Tommy Orange explores the lives of a dozen different Native Americans living in modern-day urban cities in “There There.” Each character is somehow linked to the others, and, as the novel progresses, each person finds himself or herself at the Oakland powwow, where their paths intersect. Orange masterfully debuts a shockingly powerful story, expertly creating and weaving together characters while exploring the depths of indigenous culture with unrelenting honesty and poignancy.
Orange employs an uncommon style in his prose: A recent graduate of the MFA program at the Institute of American Indian Arts, he clearly finds inspiration in sources outside the overwhelmingly white canon of authors taught and discussed in America. He switches between first and third person, depending on the character whose identity he assumes, and even writes one chapter in second person, creating a powerfully charged atmosphere. Furthermore, “There There” has no discernible beginning, middle, or end. The book shows the lives of twelve people for a certain period of time, and, at the end, discontinues the storyline. Orange is unafraid to break the conventional “rules” of the American novel and he does so with such mastery that strong emotional attachment to the characters is effortlessly established throughout the plot.
Orange also uses conciseness to his advantage. With twelve main characters and their individual histories to explore, Orange uses his words sparingly to buoy the emotional investment the reader has in each distinct character. Orange explores Octavio Gomez’s loss of his father in a single paragraph: “They rolled up on our house and emptied their guns into it, into the life we’d known, the life our mom and dad spent years making from scratch. My dad was the only one to get hit. My mom was in the bathroom, and Junior was in his room at the back of the house. My dad put himself in front of me, blocked the bullets with his body.” In just four sentences, Orange brings Octavio’s feelings to life. The reader is unceremoniously dumped into the characters’ lives, feeling their emotions, successes, and afflictions. Though several characters only have one chapter devoted to them before the powwow, Orange’s dexterity as a writer quickly creates an emotional bond between reader and character.
In one chapter, the character Paul abuses his wife, Blue. Blue hides from Paul in a bathroom, hoping to catch a bus away from him to the powwow. “C’mon baby. Come out. Where are you going?" the text says. "My legs are tired. My knees throb from the crash. I get down from the toilet.” Orange’s prose does not sugarcoat—he explores Blue’s abuse with terrifying poignancy. It is easy, and terrifying, to feel fear alongside Blue as her husband stalks her.
The characters that Orange brings to life differ greatly from one another—though they all attend the powwow and many are blood relatives, their reasons for doing so vary drastically, from exploring one’s culture, to working a job, to meeting up with long-lost fathers, to planning to rob the event. Orange makes it clear that although they are all part of a unified history, their stories are diverse.
Orange’s debut novel breaks from the concept of the standard American story. He creates something even more poignant and affecting with the power to permanently change its reader.

The Northeast coast bustles with life over the summer months as America’s elite flock to the Hamptons or Nantucket. And Author Beatriz Williams’ fictional Winthrop Island in her new book, “The Summer Wives,” is no different. Woven between three time periods—1930, 1950, 1969—Williams traces the saga of Miranda Schuyler from her induction into the life of Winthrop to her two-decade banishment and return. Though Williams creates an engaging drama and successfully patches three timelines together, the romance is as breezy of a read as the waters Williams writes of, satisfying but falling short of heart-wrenching.
When Miranda’s mom marries the wealthy Hugh Fisher after the death of her father in World War II, Miranda is swept into Winthrop’s wealthy and elite class of “Families” and her new beautiful half-sister, Isobel. The rest of the island consists mostly of fishermen and workers, among them Joseph Vargas, whom Miranda finds herself drawn to, though she keeps her attraction at bay due to the mysterious and intimate relationship between Isobel and Joseph. When Miranda returns to Winthrop two decades later as an acclaimed movie star, she claims to be finding “someplace quiet to lick my wounds.” As the summer months breeze through, so does Williams’ plot, unwrapping Miranda’s history on the Island and her life thereafter that led her to return.
Major themes that drive the plot in the 1950 timeline of the book depend heavily on World War II. Other than the death of Miranda’s father, the War shaped the attitude of those on the Island, including Isobel’s goody-two-shoes fiancé, Harvard Law School graduate and World War II vet Clayton Monk, who just wants to settle down and have a family. For those who weren’t involved in the action, like Isobel, there seems to be a great disconnect and added restlessness to the attitude of not just Clayton but also all of the seemingly-quaint Winthrop. “I don’t understand how everybody could come back from the war and just sit there with a gin and tonic and play bridge,” Isobel complained to Miranda. “God, what a drag. It’s like they’ve all gone to sleep.”
While Williams develops influences of the post-World War II era in the 1950 events in the novel, when Miranda returns to Winthrop in 1969, it seems as if current events barely affect the characters in the book. The shortage of historical details in later sections are disappointing. For the significance and disturbance that the Vietnam War afflicted across America, the book contains no mention of it, and the Cold War only gets small mentions. The idea of a summer home, an island and haven away from the rest of the world, is reinforced by the lack of these allusions. At the same time, this does signal a change in the Island—it grips tighter onto traditions and its insular nature, desperately holding onto whatever is left of the peace Miranda disrupted in 1950.
As for the drama that unfolds on the island, Williams is kind in crafting her villains on Winthrop. They’re still villains, but pitiful villains. They have “overly rich,” dead parents (or sometimes both). The rest of her characters are intriguing, but more often predictable than not. When Miranda returns, Joseph, who’s been imprisoned all these years for a murder that he didn’t commit—which is almost obvious from Williams’ first mention of the murder—has recently escaped. Readers know he’s bound to elope with Miranda sooner or later, yet Williams’ still builds an impressive amount of mystery. It’s that portioned amount of suspense that makes the novel indulgent, with juicy details that would send members of the Winthrop Clubhouse whispering from table to table.
The buildup of chemistry between Miranda and Joseph is well-elaborated and swooning, but the story is too perfect to be hard-hitting. Since 1950, as Joseph has been in jail all these years and Miranda’s famous movie director husband proves himself to be consistently worse and worse with each turning page, it’s clear Miranda and Joseph are still very much in love with each other when she returns. Of course he’s escaped from prison around the same time she decides to leave her husband. The drama’s set-up presents obstacles to that romance, and while those challenges are bitter, Williams injects a sense of hopefulness into her writing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon arriving at Boston Logan International Airport in the August before my freshman year, I couldn’t help but have one intense observation over and over again: Boston is most definitely not Birmingham.
Between the number of people roaming through the airport, the seemingly endless underground tunnels for cars, the marked presence of public transportation, and, of course, the bay, what struck me about the city was not to so much what was moving, but how quickly it moved. Time seemed to contract in on itself and double over, as though the sun had had one too many espresso shots and was desperately trying to meet some looming, cosmic deadline.
In the comfort of soft, Southern sunrises and evenings punctuated by fireflies and calls for dinner, I’d never thought to consider time as a resource, especially not one that I was in any danger of running out of. In fact, if Alabama is the “Heart of Dixie,” its veins are saturated with that very sense of unquestioned ease. The drawn-out vowels of the Southern accent only echo this certainty.
For better or worse, I can’t help but see time as a friend who has been with me since my days in Alabama elementary school, when recess alone seemed to last a million years and adulthood seemed at least three times as many away. It’s a mentality that I can’t seem to shake. On one hand, I’ve probably missed out on more than a few comps that I could have completed and probably confused a photodiode for a solar cell. On the other hand, I have found a way to make myself feel consistently happy. Of course, the conditions for my happiness are unique to my circumstances, but I think that changing the way we look at time can lead to a more universal sense of peace. There’s nothing wrong with recognizing distractions for what they are, but distractions can be as much of a stepping-stone as they can a road-block, since they allow for introspection and, more importantly, a break.
Harvard students could benefit from finding a sense of personal peace to replace the sense of certain doom that otherwise prevails. The combination of an admissions rate that only lowers from year to year and competition among students who somehow manage to beat these odds can foster remarkable ingenuity, but it can also foster the unhealthy sense that every moment counts, as though an invisible timer is keeping track of every wasted second.
Throughout the course of my freshman year, my lack of such an internal clock became an object of fascination among my friends. “How do you just do that?” my friends would ask, incredulous at some impulsive decision of mine, whether it was rock-climbing before dinner or flying to Iceland before finals. Though the syntax varied, the point remained constant: “Don’t you feel like you’re wasting your time?”
In truth, they had a point. More than once, I examined my nonchalance with disdain as I watched my friends artfully leverage the time they had so carefully not wasted for personal and professional dividends. However, every time that I faced another extra opportunity to be “productive,” it’d slip away without much thought as I opted for a sunny afternoon by the river or a three-hour conversation detailing the intricacies of chocolate, life, and James Joyce when I was supposed to be studying for a biology midterm.
Whenever things seemed to fall apart, though, it was this very freedom that suddenly felt more like stability. In the intersection of staying slow and keeping steady, I’d found a sort of armor that protected me from Harvard’s intensity when it would grow dangerously high. Navigating Harvard’s many deadlines and expectations would have been nearly impossible without this assurance.
In allowing myself to slow down, I have found a steadiness that carries me from one hardship to the next, and it’s a steadiness I learned to look for in days spent on rope-swings by the creek. I’m not saying that everybody’s peace waits at the bottom of a pitcher of sweet tea or a front porch, but I think we owe it to ourselves to take a second just to look, to see if we can find a little taste of Birmingham in Boston. Luke Bryan said it himself: “Slow it down, soak it in.” We’ve got to do what we can to try to make the good times last.

Clover Fast Food Inc. paid over $79,000 in back wages and damages to 65 employees after the Department of Labor determined the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.
In a blog post, Clover owner Ayr Muir wrote Clover decided to settle with the department because it could not afford to bring the case to court. The department’s investigation into the restaurant chain stretched for more than four years, according to Muir.
Clover operates 12 locations in the greater Boston area, including restaurants in the Science Center, Harvard Square, and Central Square. The chain used to run a fleet of food trucks, but closed them down in summer 2017.
Muir wrote in his blog post that he found the investigation “disturbing.”
“We thought we were doing everything on the up and up,” he wrote. “From day 1 at Clover I’ve wanted us to adhere to all laws and regulations.”
The department calculated that Clover missed more than $39,000 in salary payments, most of which resulted from the company’s categorization of food truck managers as salaried employees instead of per-hour employees.
Muir wrote he believed food truck managers should be designated as salaried employees.
According to the department, Clover also compensated certain employees with regular instead of overtime payments when they worked 40-plus hour workweeks. Muir attributed these mistakes to occasional errors in the payroll person’s calculations.
The department further concluded Clover improperly deducted from its employee salaries. Muir wrote these deductions resulted from people taking vacations outside their paid time off.
Muir added he felt “fantastic” about most of the settlement.
“How can I be mad about paying any employee I love more money?” he wrote.
But he took issue with how the department handled the investigation.
“How can we have a system where small business owners are trying to follow every law but still can’t get it right?” Muir wrote. “And if something happens that was completely unintentional and you’re willing to fix it should you be punished?”
A spokesperson for Muir declined to comment and pointed to Muir’s blog post. Department of Labor spokesman Ted Fitzgerald also declined to comment and referenced the department’s earlier press release.
“The resolution of this case puts these wages into the hands of those who earned them, and demonstrates how our enforcement levels the playing field for law-abiding employers,” the release reads. “We encourage employers to use the tools and resources the Wage and Hour Division provides, and to reach out to us for assistance to avoid violations and operate in compliance with the law.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard employee apologized Monday after a video in which she confronted a woman whose biracial daughter was playing outside her apartment—and asked the woman whether she lives in affordable housing—went viral over the weekend and drew widespread criticism online.
In the video, posted to Facebook July 14 by Cambridge resident Alyson Laliberte, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Executive Director Theresa A. Lund tells Laliberte that she and her daughter are being too noisy. Lund then repeatedly asks Laliberte where she lives.
“Are you in one of the affordable units? Or are you in one of the Harvard units?” Lund asks.
Since Laliberte posted the video, it has garnered more than 1 million views. In the post, Laliberte dubs Lund “another Permit Patty,” referencing a recent series of nationally publicized incidents in which white adults have confronted or called the police on black children performing everyday activities like selling lemonade. Laliberte wrote on Facebook that Lund’s actions were “discriminating and racist.”
Lund later apologized for the incident in a post on her personal Facebook page, writing there was “no reason” for her to have asked Laliberte whether she lives in affordable housing.
“I am terribly sorry about the exchange I had with my neighbor yesterday. What I said was inappropriate and wrong,” Lund wrote.
Lund also wrote that she should not have addressed Laliberte’s daughter, referencing a moment in the video where she turned to the child and said, “You are a sweetheart, I’m sorry that I’m fighting here with your mommy. She’s not being very nice.” Lund has since apologized to the mother-daughter pair in person, according to her post.
“I am accountable for my actions and ask for their forgiveness for a moment in which I fell far short of my values and what I expect of myself,” Lund wrote.
Lund has deleted her social media accounts, including Facebook. She did not respond to a request for comment.
The clip depicts Lund sitting on the sidewalk near Laliberte and her daughter. Lund complains that there is screaming outside her window.
“I’m outside enjoying the afternoon with my daughter when this woman came downstairs and asked me if I would move,” Laliberte wrote. “She followed me around and harassed me trying to get my information and apartment number as if she had a right to know.”
Laliberte wrote she was particularly offended by Lund’s question asking whether she lived in an affordable unit.
“Why do people think they are literally better than others? Why does she think she has a right to make us move?” Laliberte wrote. “I’ve lived in this complex for 15 years. Not one other person complained about my daughter and I.”
The video was shared widely across social media networks, including Twitter, where Lund earned the nickname “#SidewalkSusie” and “#NaptimeNancy.”
HHI Director Michael J. VanRooyen commented on the video Sunday afternoon, writing in a now-deleted tweet that the post does not accurately reflect Lund’s character.
“Theresa Lund is an ethical and principled individual and leader. The recent posts do not represent who she is, or who were are.#hhi #HHI2018,” his tweet read.
VanRooyen did not respond to a request for comment.
Lund appears to have disappeared from HHI’s website. Before its removal, her page stated that she has served in administrative positions at the Graduate School of Design and at the Kennedy School.
HHI is based at the School of Public Health. HSPH spokesperson Todd Datz declined to comment.
