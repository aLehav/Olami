After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite falling short of reclaiming the Ivy League Championship title from Ancient Eight rival Princeton, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team still finished the winter with a successful season.
The Crimson earned second place at both the ECAC and Ivy League Championships for the second straight year and amassed a 6-1 Ivy record. Its sole flaw to an otherwise perfect record was two losses to the Tigers, once during the regular season and twice during postseason play.
Harvard set the bar high at the start of the season, opening Ivy League competition with a strong showing against Dartmouth and Cornell in Hanover. Freshman Paige Newell had a solid Ivy debut, taking first in the 500-yard and 1000-yard freestyle races. Junior Meghan Leddy touched the wall first in the 200-yard IM and backstroke, as well. The Crimson defeated the Big Green, 184.5-115.5, and the Big Red, 186-114.
The following weekend, Harvard continued its Ivy dominance, defeating Columbia, 189-111. The Crimson took first in 10 of the 16 events, with four freshmen topping all of their competitors. Freshman Sara Li placed first in the 200-yard freestyle, rookie Danielle Schulkin won the 200-yard butterfly, and classmate Schuyler Moore earned first place in the one-meter diving event.
Freshmen Jenna Gregoire combined with junior Monica Burgos and seniors Ali Slack and Katy Hinkle to capture the 200-yard freestyle relay title in a facility-best time of 1:35.57.
“The freshmen have been great,” Leddy said. “They’ve really lightened and cheered up the mood and are just a breath of fresh air on the team. They’ve been swimming so fast and have handled themselves very well this year. They’ve really impressed a lot of us.”
Harvard brought in the first month of 2011 with victories against Brown and Penn. The Crimson took down the Bears, 198-97, earning first place in 13 of 16 events. Senior Kate Mills led the team with wins in the 100-yard butterfly and 400-yard IM. Sophomore Laura Evans also dominated, topping her competitors in the 100-yard backstroke and 400-yard IM.
Harvard gained wins in 13 events against the Quakers, including a diving sweep with Moore’s one-meter diving victory and senior Jenny Reese’s first-place finish in the three-meter dive.
After five straight victories, the Crimson entered the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet in New Haven determined to uphold its perfect record. But Harvard split the meet, experiencing its first and only loss of the regular season as it beat the Bulldogs, 217-83, and fell to the Tigers, 207-93. Princeton grabbed victories in every event but two, but Li took first in the 200-yard IM, and Hinkle, Slack, Gregoire and Mills combined to win the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Following a four-week break from Ivy competition, the Crimson had a shot at retribution after its previous loss against the Tigers when it traveled to Princeton for the Ivy championship.
Though Harvard ultimately finished second with 1,436 points to Princeton’s 1,562, the team still garnered 10 All-Ivy nods—including five first-team honorees—for its performances at the meet. Mills was also recognized as the career-high point swimmer, compiling a total of 330 points in four years of competition at the league championship meet.
“I think we swam our hearts out, and every single person contributed to the team,” Mills said. “For me, the highlight was the 400-yard freestyle relay. We actually lost, but everyone was cheering on the side like we’d broken a world record because they were so excited about how hard we’d competed, regardless of the whether we’d won or lost. ”
In the same weekend, the Crimson also finished in second place at the ECAC Championships, this time losing by a heartbreakingly close margin of 1.5 points to New Hampshire. Sophomore Courtland Kelly was awarded the Diver of the Meet award after capturing the top spot in the three-meter event and third in the one-meter dive.
The team will graduate nine seniors this year, including Mills, who leaves Harvard holding school records in two relays and three individual events.
“This season has been incredible, and so much of that is because of the senior leadership on the team,” Gregoire said. “The captains did an amazing job, and all of the seniors made me and the other freshmen feel like a part of the swimming family with no hesitation. I’m very fortunate to have such good role models and upperclassmen to look up to. They’ll be missed a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After completing an undefeated regular season, including a clean sweep in the HYP meet, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team fell short at the Ivy League Championship, finishing second to Princeton.
“We had a really strong team,” senior Zac Ranta said. “Having an undefeated season was great. We would have loved to be successful at Ivies but can’t be disappointed with an undefeated season.”
The Crimson (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) started the season on a tear, easily beating Dartmouth and Cornell in the year’s first two matches, 222-78 and 216-82, respectively.
In the home opener, Harvard took on Columbia and jumped out to an early lead when Crimson freshman Wes Stearns won the 1650-yard freestyle.
Stearns finished the race in 15:52.83, 10 seconds faster than the rest of the field.
The team never looked back. In the next event, the 200 freestyle, Harvard freshmen Chris Satterthwaite and Spenser Goodman finished one and two, respectively, giving the Crimson a commanding lead en route to a 196-102 win.
Harvard continued to dominate as the season progressed, recording wins over Boston University, Connecticut, Brown, and Penn. None of these teams came within 50 points of the Crimson.
But the competition got a little tougher in the annual HYP meet against Yale and Princeton.
The Tigers, who were also undefeated heading into the match, proved to be Harvard’s first real challenge all season, but the Crimson held on for a 189-164 win. The Bulldogs didn’t put up much of a fight, and Harvard crushed Yale, 266-87.
Sophomore Michael Stanton won the three meter and the one meter while Stearns capped off the victory with a NCAA provisional mark of 4:28.23 in the 500 freestyle.
“The highlight of the year would have to be winning HYP,” captain Justin Davidson said. “That’s the meet that everything really came together for us. It was great to be able to celebrate a victory like that with the team.”
A month after the HYP victory, the Crimson tried to maintain its position as the top team in the Ancient Eight at the year’s biggest meet: the Ivy League Championships.
But Harvard’s reign atop the Ivies proved to be short-lived.
Princeton took the early lead and barely held off the Crimson, tallying 1,400 points to Harvard’s 1,394.5.
The Crimson kept it interesting to the end. With only the 400-meter freestyle relay remaining, Harvard had a shot at taking the meet, trailing the Tigers by 7.5 points. But the Crimson placed second in the race behind Columbia, and Harvard finished second in the championship.
“Obviously, we would have loved to score an extra six points and won the meet,” Davidson said. “But with that being said I think we fought hard for three days till the very end. I think everyone really put themselves on the line. The way we were racing and competing, there is a lot to admire in the effort we put forth.”
At the end of the championship, Ranta was presented with the Ron Keenhold Award, as he earned more career points as a diver at the Ivy League Championships than any other senior in the Ancient Eight.
“The meet itself was so exciting, and there was so much energy,” Ranta said. “I think the success for me would be winning the Ron Keenhold career high-point diving award…[but] just the whole Ivy championship meet in general was really an exciting time for the team. [It] was a great way to end the season.”
But the season hadn’t quite ended for three Crimson divers, who traveled to Annapolis, Md., to take part in the NCAA Zone Diving Championships.
Stanton finished 13th in the one-meter event and 16th in the three-meter final. Zarrella placed 16th in the one-meter event, and Ranta finished 13th in the three meter.
“I’m incredibly proud of what we accomplished,” Davidson said. “We won the HYP, which we haven’t done for the past two years. Even though we barely missed taking the conference [championship meet], the team’s looking great for years to come based off the number of young guys we have we have coming up in the ranks. I would say there is a lot to look forward to in the future.”

Even without an Ivy League title, Harvard football and its seniors still made program history.
The team came into the season as contenders for the Ancient Eight crown. But losses on the road to Brown and Penn—the eventual Ivy League champion for the second year in a row—took the Crimson out of the running.
Despite these two conference losses, Harvard had little trouble with the rest of its Ivy League competition. For the fourth year in a row, the Crimson defeated Princeton, Yale, and Dartmouth—the first time in program history that any senior class has gone 12-0 against these three schools.
“We would have loved to win the Ivy League championship this year,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “[But the seniors] certainly got a lot to be proud of. They’ve got a tremendous legacy.”
From early on in the season, the team’s shot at an Ivy title was hampered by injuries, a problem that plagued the Crimson for the entire year. By the third game of the 2010 campaign, sophomore Colton Chapple—the third-string quarterback—was starting for Harvard. Junior Collier Winters was already out to start the season, and his backup, senior Andrew Hatch, suffered a concussion in the team’s second game against Brown.
But the men taking the snaps weren’t the only ones who dealt with injury. Senior wide receivers Marco Iannuzzi and Chris Lorditch both missed time, as did sophomore defensive backs D.J. Monroe and Brian Owusu.
Because of the injuries throughout the season, the team had to shift its strategy early on.
“It became more of a ball control offense,” Murphy said. “We didn’t have as much big-play capability without the big, strong arms of those kids and those big, fast receivers. We became more of a ball-control offense—don’t turn the ball over, [stay] in the game, win by making the least mistakes as opposed to [doing it by being] a big-play team.”
This change in the Crimson’s game plan brought senior running back Gino Gordon into an even more prominent role. Though some of the injured starters returned to their positions later in the season, Gordon remained the key component of Harvard’s offense.
“Not too many teams could try to shut down Gino Gordon and leave our receivers open,” Iannuzzi said. “It was a really good balance in terms of the run-pass game and utilizing our strengths, which really was our running game over the past couple of years.”
The team opened the season with a win against Holy Cross, continuing its all-time unbeaten streak in home night games. But a loss in week two to the Bears put Harvard in an early hole in the Ivy League standings.
The Crimson took its next three Ivy contests against Cornell, Princeton, and Dartmouth, winning each by a comfortable margin.
But after its loss a few weeks earlier in Providence, Harvard came into its game against the Quakers—the defending league champions—knowing it was a must-win to stay in the title hunt.
“It’s only really in the last decade that anybody has really stepped up and challenged [Penn],” Murphy said. “They do a lot of things well, but the thing they do better than anyone in the league consistently is play great defense. They’ve won more scoring defense titles than any team in our league in the past 25 years.”
Harvard never challenged the Quakers, falling behind Penn 10-0 at the half and 27-0 at the end of the third quarter to put the game—and Ivy League title aspirations—out of reach. The Quakers went on to win, 34-14.
“I know we’ve come out flat a couple times where we don’t start playing them until the third or fourth quarters,” Iannuzzi said. “Unfortunately, when you come out flat, you put yourself in a bad spot, and it’s really tough to recover.”
Out of the title hunt, the team turned its focus to The Game.
The Crimson found itself down 14-7 at the half. But with Harvard receiving at the start of the third quarter, Iannuzzi returned the kickoff 84 yards for the touchdown to tie the game. The Crimson would score two more unanswered touchdowns and ended the year on a 28-21 win.
The victory was not only the fourth in a row for Harvard over the Bulldogs, but it also was the ninth time in the last ten years that the Crimson has taken The Game from the Elis.
“I think it’s a really great [source] of pride for our class, [and] I think a lot of the alums and any Harvard football fans are really proud of that,” Iannuzzi said. “It’ll always be something we remember, sweeping Yale. It’s one of the biggest rivalries ever, and we’re glad to accomplish that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To an outsider, Josue Ortiz became one of the most important defensive players in Ivy League football in 2010, and one of the best.
But his teammates have a simpler understanding of the senior defensive tackle.
“To be honest, he’s just a man-beast in terms of his physical strength,” said senior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi.
Ortiz led the Ivy League with 7.5 sacks last season. No other player on the Harvard squad had more than 2.5, and Ortiz was also third on the team in tackles with 54.
With every passing season, the defensive tackle has assumed a bigger role for the Crimson. After sitting out what would have been his rookie season with an injury, he appeared in just three games during his sophomore year.
It was only during his junior year that Ortiz—who is eligible for one more season and will play for Harvard next year—began to assume his present role. But even then, he registered only two sacks and did not start at all in 2009.
Despite a solid performance last season, Ortiz only really came into his own in 2010.
“He just became a dominant player,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “He came in really raw and rough. He’s one of those kids that has improved so dramatically from year to year to the point where this year, he was the best defensive player in the league.”
After his best season to date—one in which he developed into a game-changing player—Ortiz was named to the All-Ivy first team, All-New England FCS team, and AP All-American third team.
Throughout the season, Ortiz was consistently a threat. But it was in two of the team’s biggest games in 2010—the night game against Holy Cross and The Game against Yale—that he put together some of his best performances of the year.
Against the Bulldogs, he notched 11 tackles, a forced fumble, and a blocked punt on the way to Harvard’s fourth consecutive victory over Yale.
“I can specifically remember, leading up to Yale weeks, [Ortiz had] the exact same mental preparation and the exact same physical preparation as for any other week of the season,” Iannuzzi said. “He’s not psyching himself out.”
Ortiz’s breakout performance in 2010 was a major step up from 2009, both in terms of playing time and the numbers he put together for the Crimson. But according to Murphy, he has positioned himself to improve as he heads into his final year for Harvard.
“I think Josue, far and away, is going to be our best football player,” he said. “But [if] he keeps improving, I think he has a good chance to be the best player in the league at any position.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Depending on how you look at it, the Harvard ski team’s 2010-2011 season was either mediocre or wildly successful.
On the one hand, the Crimson was unable to improve its team results from last year, earning ninth-place finishes every single weekend in the regular season. But from an individual standpoint, Harvard’s season was the best it has ever been, as the team sent three skiers—the most in program history—to the NCAA Championships this winter.
Freshman Rebecca Nadler and sophomore Catherine Sheils became the first alpine skiers from the Crimson ever to go to NCAAs, while sophomore Alena Tofte became the first Nordic skier to qualify since 2004.
“I think we were all proud,” Nadler said. “It was really great to be able to all go together [and] have that support.”
The three took different paths to their NCAA qualifications. Nadler posted outstanding results at the beginning of the season that guaranteed a spot in the postseason before the season had hit its midpoint. Sheils improved throughout the year and hit her stride just in time for the season’s biggest races.
At the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championships, Sheils 14th place finish was the best of any Harvard skiers, which was especially impressive given that she is usually stronger in the giant slalom. She also placed 22nd in the giant slalom.
“I think Catherine kind of surprised herself,” Tofte said. “For me, [it was] kind of the same, I guess.”
Tofte posted consistently strong results throughout the season. Some of her highlights included an eighth-place finish in the 10k Classic race at the Colby Carnival and a second-place finish in the 5k race at the TD Bank Eastern Cup at Weston Golf Course. Tofte was in third place for much of the race but sprinted past former Olympic gold medalist Nina Gavrilyuk to take second.
“I was excited that I started doing well,” Tofte said. “It ended up being a really, really fun time.”
At the NCAAs, Nadler’s 20th in the slalom topped all Crimson skiers at NCAAs. Tofte earned a 31st-place finish in the 5k free race while Sheils earned 28th in the slalom.
The trio’s finishes gave Harvard a 17th-place finish at NCAAs, which was still ninth among Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association (EISA) schools.
The EISA showed itself to be the strongest conference in the country as four schools finished in the top 10, including Dartmouth, which took third place.
Freshmen Nordic skiers Jen Rolfes and Chris Stock qualified for a different kind of postseason—the Junior Olympics—and boasted strong performances throughout the year.
At the TD Bank Eastern Cup races, the season’s fourth event, both Rolfes and Stock stood out. Stock earned third place in the 1.5k sprint while Rolfes placed sixth in both the sprint and in the afternoon 5k race.
The pair of rookies also led the charge in two events at the EISA championships, with Rolfe’s 21st place pacing the Crimson in the 5k freestyle race and Stock’s 31st leading the charge in men’s 10k freestyle race. Stock went on to take third in the 15k classic mass start at the Junior Olympics while Rolfes took sixth in the classic mass start race.
Both skiers are expected to make a big impact on the team in the years to come.
“They both improved a ton and did extremely extremely well at the Junior Olympics,” Tofte said. “They’re both very, very strong athletes...They ski technically well, and they have great work ethics.”
Despite Harvard’s consistent ninth-place finishes, for several members of the team, the 2010-2011 season was one to remember.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You would think that after nearly 250 Crimson articles over the last four years, banging out one last column would be a breeze. But when I sat down at my computer, I found myself, for nearly the first time, at a loss for words.
The task of distilling my relationship with sports, with The Crimson, and with Harvard seemed something too big to take on in a 900-word column. There were too many moments, too many friendships, and too many lessons. Sports has defined my relationship with The Crimson, which in turn has defined my four years at Harvard, and figuring out a way to put that down on paper seemed impossible.
I tried for days to think of a way to make my experiences sound profound, to no avail. Because what I finally came to realize is that my four years with the sports board have been, in many ways, just like sports itself—ordinary routines peppered with some extraordinary moments.
I came to Harvard not knowing what to expect, but becoming sports chair of The Crimson certainly wasn’t it. I never imagined that I would spend my Saturdays driving around the Northeast following a football team and my Sundays cooped up in a tiny office mulling over the finer points of grammar and hoping the computer wouldn’t crash. My parents, at least, certainly imagined me doing more schoolwork. But the stories—and the people who taught me how to write them—kept me coming back for more.
Like the story of the football walk-on who became a Rhodes Scholar, or the softball pitcher who hung up her glove and became a coach, or the hockey coach who quietly rose to the top of her profession. In 12 seasons of writing, I saw thrilling comebacks, championship runs, and extraordinary individual performances.
But in sports, not every game can be a thriller. Not every player can be the best. It’s easy to write about the games that everybody was at anyways, or the games won on a last-second shot. Far harder is the task sportswriters face on a near-daily basis: how to make the ordinary seem anything but.
It’s that task that made me fall in love with sports even more.
The place that I will always associate with college sports is my seat in the middle of the Bright Hockey Center press box, a place where I watched dozens of women’s hockey games from over the last four years. I picked up the beat during the fairytale 2007-2008 season, when the team exceeded all expectations to go 32-2 and hold the No. 1 ranking in the country for much of the year. In fact, I was on the beat for over a year before I ever had to write about a loss.
The next three seasons were successful by many standards but didn’t come close to matching the top-four national finish of the 2008 squad. The team never made it back to the Frozen Four; in fact, it was shut out of the NCAA field in two out of those three years. But as I learned more and more about the team and began to finally be able to draw parallels across years with confidence, I fell more in love with hockey, with writing, with sports.
I grew to love the challenge of finding meaning in a badly-played loss, of finding the right words to describe a dazzling goal in the midst of an otherwise average game. I wound up being more familiar with ECAC women’s hockey than with most of my academic classes and was more comfortable in interviews than talking in section.
It helped, of course, that I found myself surrounded by people who were just as willing to geek out about these things as I was. While writing was something I did for me, I never could have spent two years on the masthead without loving the people I was doing it with. It’s no coincidence that many of my fondest memories at Harvard are shared with my fellow writers, some of whom have become my closest friends.
My time at Harvard has made me into a very different person from the 18-year-old girl who first wandered into The Crimson four years ago looking for somewhere to belong. I have learned to write and lead with confidence because of the lessons I learned at 14 Plympton, as I tried, failed, and learned from my mistakes over and over again. I became a better sports fan as I learned to appreciate the little things each game—win or loss, thriller or blowout—had to offer.
As I move away from Massachusetts for the first time, I know that my time at Harvard has prepared me for the so-called real world in so many ways. Because I have learned how to fail and how to persevere, I know that I will be prepared to stand up in front of a classroom next year. Because I have experienced the ways that sports can bring a community together, I am confident that learning to love Drew Brees and Chris Paul will help me integrate into my new home of New Orleans.
But most importantly, I have learned how to appreciate the meaningful in the ordinary—the two-hour dinners in the dining hall with friends, the moment when the solution to a physics problem finally becomes clear, the pride you feel when you see your words splashed across the front page of the newspaper. And I can think of no better lesson that college and sports could have taught me.

The co-ed and women’s squads of the Harvard sailing team have enjoyed tremendous success this past spring, both finishing the season ranked in the top ten nationally. As the season quickly winds down, both hope to add one more victory to their already-impressive resumes. in the coming weeks.
The women’s sailing team will compete in its final regatta of the season, the 44th Intercollegiate Sailing Association Women’s National Championship, in Cascade Locks, Ore., May 23-26.
“All of our hard work this season has paid off, knowing that we have a shot at the national title when we go over to Oregon,” junior Alexandra Jumper said. “We’ve raced against some of the best teams in the country over the past season, and hopefully we’ll get to prove that we have what it takes to be number one.”
Despite an inexperienced women’s squad, the team came back from some early-season struggles to finish 10th in the nation behind the leadership of Jumper and junior co-captain Emily Lambert.
“We’ve had some ups and downs as a team over the season, but we fought through all of them,” Lambert said. “With the experience that we’ve gotten this year, we’re going to be even stronger next year. We’re already near the top of the competition, but we’re going to keep going until we’re the best.”
Both Jumper and Lambert were selected to the All-New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association women’s sailing team, a tribute to their consistency and success as a duo, having sailed together in nearly every regatta this season in the A-division for the Crimson.  Arguably Jumper and Lambert’s most impressive performance came in their last regatta—the Women’s New England Championship—when the two captured a second-place finish and helped Harvard qualify for nationals. Jumper received first-team honors as a crew while Lambert received first-team accolades as a skipper.
Not to be outdone by their counterparts on the women’s squad, the members of the Crimson’s co-ed sailing team will be making their own trip to Cascade Locks to compete in the 76th ICSA/Gill Dinghy National Championships May 30-June 1.
But in team racing, for the second year in a row, the co-eds failed to qualify for the national championship regatta, falling one spot short of gaining a qualifying bid. The squad finished fourth at the 62nd New England Team Race Championships.
“We were close to having a shot at two national titles this year,” senior Alan Palmer said. “We did qualify for the Dinghy Championships, which we made one of our goals at the beginning of the season, so that’s what we’re going to focus on now instead of thinking about what could have been.”
The co-ed team competing at the Dinghy Championships has been one of the nation’s top-ranked teams all season long, often competing with powerhouses Georgetown and Boston College for the first seed atop the college sailing rankings.
The Crimson even spent several weeks as the number one team in the country.
Harvard ended the spring season ranked No. 3 but did claim the top spot in the Ivy League standings. The team still hopes to climb two spots and claim a national championship at the end of the month.
“We know that we’re one of the best teams out there,” sophomore Alma Lafler said. “But now is the time to show it by taking nationals by storm. We’ve been great all season long but so have other teams. Now we have to step it up and use the time until nationals to get some hardcore practice in so that we can prove to everyone that we deserve to be called the best.”
The co-eds earned 12 finishes in the top four during the regular season, including three first-place finishes and two in back-to-back weeks.
The co-ed squad was anchored all season long by its seniors, five of whom were selected to All-NEISA co-ed teams. Palmer was chosen as a member of the All-NEISA skipper first team, and co-captain Tedd Himler and John Stokes were honored as members of the second team. Classmates Quincy Bock and Meghan Wareham received crew first-team honors.
“This group of six seniors that we have is probably one of the best that we’ve had in a long time here at Harvard,” senior Colin Santangelo said. “We had three heavily recruited skippers competing for our top two spots, and that has taken us to another level competitively and also has kept us in the mix nationally.”
“Some of my best memories here at Harvard have been with my friends from the sailing team,” Palmer added. “We only have a little time left together as a team, so why not make one of our last memories together by winning a national championship?”

After sweeping the Ivy League Championship Series against Cornell, the Harvard softball team (36-16, 18-2 Ivy) earned  a spot in the NCAA tournament for the fourth time in team history.
The team cleaned up league awards, as 10 Harvard players were named to the All-Ivy first or second teams, tying the program record.
But beyond the individual accolades, the accomplishments of the group are the greatest source of pride for the team.
“Winning the Ivy League was definitely the highlight of the season,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said.
Not surprisingly, Allard also expressed her desire to perform well at NCAA Regionals in Arizona, but Harvard could not execute in its first two playoff games. The team was shut out—outscored 17-0 in the first two games of tournament play—ending the season for the Crimson.
Despite the postseason success, Harvard had perhaps the best year in the history of the program, and the squad earned all three of the highest Ivy League accolades that are given out at the end of each year, a feat not accomplished since Princeton in 1994.
Co-captain second baseman Ellen Macadam was named Ivy League Player of the Year, as she led the Ancient Eight with 76 hits and 52 runs scored. She also holds those records in Crimson program history.
Junior pitcher Rachel Brown and rookie third baseman Kasey Lange were both unanimous selections for Ivy League Pitcher and Rookie of the Year, respectively.
Junior shortstop Jane Alexander, sophomore outfielder Stephanie Regan, freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone, freshman catcher Allie Scott, junior first baseman Whitney Shaw, sophomore outfielder Ashley Heritage, and junior pitcher and infielder Marika Zumbro earned places on the All-Ivy teams.
“I think we’ve had very dedicated and committed seniors, experienced veterans, and a great freshmen class,” Allard said. “I think they’re one of the most competitive teams I’ve ever coached. We have great depth—lots of players can step up. And they work really well playing together by having a lot of fun with each other.”
“There’s been great leadership from upperclassmen, and we have a phenomenal freshmen class that has really contributed a lot to the team energy,” Macadam added. “And we’ve had great pitching and a stellar offense to back it up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cream always rises to the top.
In her first two weekends of skiing, Rebecca Nadler established herself as one of the best skiers in the nation and arguably the greatest alpine skier Harvard has ever had. And nothing—not illness and not an injury sustained while falling off a cliff—could keep her from returning there by the end of the season.
Nadler qualified for NCAAs with a fourth-place finish in the slalom in her first weekend of college racing at the St. Lawrence Carnival and sixth the weekend after at the Colby Carnival. The rookie kept rolling with a 21st place finish in the slalom at the World University Games, where she was representing both the Crimson and Canada.
But from that point, things got more difficult. Nadler became sick while on the plane ride back from Turkey, which resulted in finishes that were not as strong as her results from the first few weeks—though she and sophomore Catherine Sheils continued to post the best results on the team.
And just when Nadler started to recover, she fell off an unmarked cliff while skiing at the Middlebury Carnival. The fall kept her out of competition for the weekend and set her skiing season back again.
“It wasn’t ideal, but I rested when I could and trained when I could,” Nadler said. “I think everyone has a few obstacles.”
But when Nadler and Sheils became Harvard’s first alpine skiers ever to qualify for the NCAA Championships, it meant that the rookie would have one last chance at success.
The conditions weren’t stacked in Nadler’s favor. A last-minute change of plans moved the races up a day on account of weather, which prevented Nadler and Sheils from having a day to practice. In her first event, the giant slalom, Nadler struggled and took 33rd.
But she came back strong. In the last event of her freshman year—the slalom—Nadler found her stride with a 20th-place finish. After a solid first run, Nadler’s second run didn’t quite go as well, as she recorded the 23rd-fastest time. But even with the slower mark, her second run was arguably more impressive as she placed eighth at the midway split, showing she has some of the best speed in the country.
“We all knew she had the potential to do very well,” said sophomore Alena Tofte, who competed for the Nordic team at NCAAs. “She kind of psyched herself up [but] pulled through. She looked so happy afterward. She just made it happen, and it turned out really well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dreams of an Ivy title three-peat were denied as the Harvard women’s soccer team (9-7-1, 4-3 Ivy) finished the 2010 season in fourth place, a disappointment in comparison to the team’s consecutive championships the past two seasons.
“I think we all are a little disappointed to not win [the Ivy League],” sophomore goalkeeper AJ Millet said. “I definitely think we had enough talent to [win it all].”
Early losses to conference opponents Penn and Brown dealt devastating blows to the title bid, and a defeat at the hands of Dartmouth in the penultimate league game of the season sealed the Crimson’s fate to an unfamiliar place in the standings.
Harvard started the season with an exhausting double-overtime tie with Long Island in the newly-built Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
The Crimson then secured a 2-0 victory over New Hampshire, with goals coming from co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh and junior forward Patricia Yau.
Sheeleigh, a scoring force in the Ancient Eight for the past four years, was recognized this season as the Ivy League Player of the Year. She and junior forward Melanie Baskind each had a team-high nine goals. Sheeleigh also contributed seven assists, finishing the year with 25 points, first in the Ivy League. The co-captain was a finalist for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award.
“I was looking forward to playing with her [this year],” freshman midfielder Peyton Johnson said. “Sheeleigh is a fierce competitor, and that makes everyone better. She works hard at every practice, and her play makes defenders scared. She’s super competitive, and she brings that to every practice.”
The Boston Breakers, a Women’s Professional Soccer franchise based in Cambridge, drafted the versatile forward in the fourth round.
After initial success, Harvard traveled to Florida and lost its two games down south. The squad then returned to the Northeast but dropped two of the subsequent three games—one of which was a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to the Quakers—resulting in a 2-4-1 record.
The team then responded by winning three straight, including victories over Ivy opponents Yale and Cornell.
In its next two matches on the road against the Bears and Siena, the Crimson jumped out to an early 1-0 lead but was unable to hold the lead en route to two 2-1 losses.
After these two tough defeats, Harvard rebounded convincingly, winning four of its next five games.
The Crimson’s run began with its 4-0 thumping of Princeton. Baskind had her best performance of the year in the game, scoring two and assisting on the other goals scored.
“We had a lot to prove going into the game,” Johnson said. “We had not-so-great results in the Ivy League up to that point, and Princeton is our toughest competitor, especially if we were to beat them on [its] home turf.”
The next match against Quinnipiac was a hard-fought, double-overtime marathon. In the 101st minute, Sheeleigh sprinted down the sideline and fired a cross past three defenders to sophomore midfielder Alexandra Conigliaro, who buried the goal past a diving goalie, finally breaking the tie and ending the grueling contest with a Harvard victory.
The Crimson played its final home game of the season against Columbia. Harvard got a lucky break at the start of the game when Conigliaro crossed the ball into the box. Her pass was tipped in by the Lions, granting the Crimson the early lead.
Sheeleigh added a goal at the 80th minute to push the lead to 2-0, giving the team a win on Senior Night and its fifth shutout of the season. The team finished with a 5-1-1 record at home and a 4-6 road record.
“[The match on Senior Night] was a really fun game to play in,” Johnson said. “Princeton and Columbia are the two most fun games, and we shut both of them down completely. We moved the ball really well and played how we wanted to play, especially for our seniors.”
In the final game of the season, two second-half Baskind goals resulted in a 3-1 victory over Fairfield. Harvard finished the season with the most goals scored in the Ivy League but also the most goals allowed.
Despite unmet expectations, the Crimson enjoyed several individual achievements, including Sheeleigh’s Ivy distinction and senior Katherine Thurber’s Fulbright Scholarship. Junior Lindsey Kowal, who earned a spot at the U.S. Under-23 Women’s National Team Training Camp, Baskind, Sheeleigh, and Conigliaro were named to All-Ivy first team, while Johnson and junior Rebecca Millock both received All-Ivy League honorable mentions.
“Overall, I think we improved as a team and we will build off that,” Baskind said. “Even though we didn’t finish the season the way we would have liked, l still think it was a good season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard began its fall season with a win over then-No. 13 Stanford and ended its schedule with a victory over then-No. 18 Penn. In between, the Crimson struggled to convert its close matches into wins, finishing 5-7-5 overall and 2-3-2 in the Ivy League to tie for fifth in the Ancient Eight. But these bookend wins speak better to the spirit of the season, in which Harvard grew as a squad and competed with some of the best teams in the nation.
“The season had its ups and downs,” co-captain Jaren LaGreca said. “We had one of the most difficult schedules we’ve ever had. As a team, we may not have had the best results, but we grew a lot, had a very unified team, and really showed perseverance through adversity. Overall, I would say we had a successful season.”
In his first season as head coach, Carl Junot led the Crimson through a tough schedule, including nine teams that would go on to participate in the NCAA Division I tournament.
Harvard initially showed promise, winning its season opener against the Cardinal in Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium in front of over 3,000 fans.
“[That match] was one of the best memories I’ve had playing Harvard soccer,” LaGreca said. “It was incredible to play in front of that crowd, because it makes it that much more special.”
“You can coach until you are blue in the face, but nothing lifts the level of play like a great environment and playing in front of crowds like that,” Junot said.
The Crimson carried its momentum to defeat Massachusetts in the second game of its season. But from there, Harvard struggled to capitalize, winning only three other matches throughout the remainder of its schedule.
Despite this, the Crimson remained competitive, with only one match of the season being determined by a goal differential larger than one.
“Overall, I think we would have liked to see more wins as opposed to ties and losses,” Junot said. “But we were happy with the competitive nature of our team...both on the wins and losses side.”
The low-scoring matches were a product of Harvard’s strong defensive unit, led by co-captain Robert Millock, and solid goalkeeping by junior Austin Harms and sophomore Brett Conrad. Millock and Harms were given All-Ivy second team and honorable mention nods, respectively.
“[Millock] is a great leader on and off the field and was a big part of our success,” Junot said. “I think we have two of the best goalkeepers in the Ivy League. Our defense is as solid as can be.”
Sophomores Scott Prozeller and Brian Rogers also had strong presences in the midfield and offensive third, respectively, with both players being named to the All-Ivy League second team.
Ultimately, the squad’s successes were a product of a team effort.
“We were more of a team and more unified this season than we had ever been before,” LaGreca said.
In its final match of the season, Harvard defeated the Quakers, 2-1, on a golden goal in double overtime, allowing the Crimson to come full circle.
“Penn had beaten us in previous years to take the Ivy title away from us,” LaGreca said. “So it was not only a redemption game from past years, but also a way to prove to ourselves…that we still were a very good team. It was a great way for the senior class to wind up their careers.”
Harvard has built off the progress from the fall season to challenge itself against international opponents, losing to the Haitian national team in penalty kicks in front of over 11,000 fans. The match was an exhibition fundraiser at Harvard Stadium to benefit Partners in Health.
The Crimson will also travel to South Korea this summer to compete.
“Ultimately, I think we’ve made progress,” Junot said. “We want to give our players an environment where they can mature. This year, we’ve really been working on shaping the team identity and figuring out what type of team we want to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Varsity athletes make up about one-fifth of the Harvard undergraduate student body.
Their friends are accustomed to their busy schedules—early mornings or late afternoons for practice, games on weekday nights and weekend afternoons, and hopefully time for classes, schoolwork, and relaxation in between.
Trying to balance the demands of a Division I college sports team and a top-tier academic university can understandably become difficult.
But some individuals take this time-crunch to a whole new level by participating in not just one, but two varsity sports—and often excelling at both.
Take Melanie Baskind. The junior starred this past season in soccer and lacrosse, achieving All-Ivy first-team status in both sports.
In soccer, Baskind tied for first in the Ancient Eight with nine goals—including three game-winners—and was second in the conference with 22 points.  The forward was named team captain for the upcoming 2011 season, a role she already holds on the women’s lacrosse team. In that sport, Baskind played midfield while finishing third on the squad in points with 34 and fourth in goals with 28. Through it all, she was able find time to excel in the classroom as well, and was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-America second team.
“Trying to make up ground [transitioning from one sport to another] in a short period of time has been difficult,” Baskind said. “[So is] dealing with the physical piece of it—trying to figure out how hard to push myself without going overboard.”
But in playing two sports, Baskind said, the benefits outweigh the downsides.
“It was a bit of challenge, particularly in the spring after I got named soccer captain, just trying to balance my time and not spread myself too thin,” she said. “But for all the difficulties, it’s the best thing I do here, and it’s just been such a positive experience that it’s all definitely worth it...It’s more than anything just really enjoyable.”
It is a sentiment that freshman Matt Brown is just beginning to share. The guard came to college planning to play basketball after he was recruited out of high school by Harvard coach Tommy Amaker.  But upon arriving at Harvard and receiving the permission of his coaches, Brown decided also to play football, a sport in which he was first-team All-New England as a high school wide receiver.
“I spent my whole career playing two sports, so it was always in the back of my mind,” Brown said. “I kind of wanted to see if I could give that a shot here. Thankfully, [football] coach [Tim] Murphy and coach Amaker were supportive, and they gave me the opportunity.”
Brown’s case is unique because the seasons of his two sports overlap, and he had to miss the first few games of the basketball season due to his football commitments. But Brown has been accustomed to that type of challenge before.
“When people ask me how I [play both sports], I really don’t know anything else,” Brown said. “Obviously just playing one sport and doing school is hard, so I don’t think it’s that much different [playing two]. It’s probably just a bit more time, a little bit more work on the body.”
Throwing passes to Brown on the field this past season was Andrew Hatch, the senior quarterback who transferred from LSU in 2008. After sitting out the 2009 season because of NCAA transfer rules, Hatch started three games under center for the Crimson this year.
As his final year of eligibility was winding down, Hatch decided to try out for the baseball team as a pitcher during spring workouts. He ended up excelling, finishing with a 2-0 record and 1.84 ERA, the second lowest on the team.
“I guess the main difference [between playing two sports and one] is the time commitment,” Hatch said. “All year round, if you play two sports, you really don’t have an offseason at all, so that was the main challenge. That with the academics constantly keeps you pretty busy.”
Like Baskind—who lettered in soccer, lacrosse, and ice hockey in high school—and Brown, who did so in basketball, football, and track and field, Hatch was also a high school three-sport star.
He says he would often ask himself whether he would have been better off simply focusing on one. Yet despite the challenges and extra time commitment, the senior says he would advise anyone in a similar situation to keep playing the sports he or she loves.
“I always feel that if you have the opportunity to do it, you might as well go for it because opportunities are limited, and when you finish college, you don’t have those opportunities anymore,” Hatch said. “[So] I would say play what you enjoy, and enjoy it more than anything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Revenge is sweet.
Taking the Ivy League championship and going to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2007 and the fifth time in school history makes it that much better.
“Winning the championship in general is such a sweet feeling, and knowing that we‘re playing a team [Cornell] that took it from us last year just makes it even sweeter,” junior Whitney Shaw said.
But the Harvard softball team’s strong season (36-16, 18-2 Ivy) didn’t just start in March. The goal of hoisting the Ancient Eight trophy has been in the making since the third and final game of last year’s Ivy League Championship Series. In 2010. both the Crimson and Big Red held a game apiece in the three-games set. Harvard looked to have the third and final game locked up, but solid pitching by the Big Red left the Crimson down one run at the final out.
“I think the game when [winning the Ivy crown] became our mission was the third game of the Ivy League title series last year,” junior Jane Alexander said. “We lost to Cornell last year, and every single time since then, our team was 110 percent focused on winning the title next year. For our training in the fall, everyone was doing extra. From the day last season ended to now, that has been our goal.”
The extra work paid off, as this year started with a five-game winning streak against Ivy League opponents before back-to-back losses to Princeton and Cornell. Harvard bounced back and from then on refused to lose any other conference game.
“We knew that every single Ivy League team was a threat, and we had to take it one team at a time, step by step,” Shaw said. “Even the teams that don’t consistently end up in the top two or three are very scrappy. Every single team is gunning for us.”
Hitting played a critical role in the team’s success, as Harvard’s offense decimated its competition. Third baseman freshman Kasey Lange, shortstop Alexander, and second basemen senior Ellen Macadam were part of the five Crimson players who won first-team All-Ivy awards. Macadam led the Ivy League in hits with 76 and runs scored with 52, good enough to win Ivy League Player of the Year, while Lange took the top spot in RBIs with 65.
“Anytime we were playing an opponent, we were confident that no matter how many runs they scored, we would score more,” Alexander said. “I think that’s a really nice confidence to have, to know that no matter what happens, you have the capability to score more offensively than the other team, which obviously is how you win.”
Along with Harvard’s big bats, the Crimson’s pitching staff secured honors of its own. Junior Rachel Brown earned Ivy League Pitcher of the Year status with a 1.90 ERA, 291 strikeouts, and 21 wins, while classmate Marika Zumbro and rookie Laura Ricciardone garnered second-team All-Ivy honors.
Brown’s statistics as well as those of the rest of the Harvard squad showcased Harvard’s new focus on smaller, more specific goals.
“We were big on making sure to set goals beforehand and not just big, general goals like [winning] the Ivies,” Shaw said. “I think we really did a great job at keeping that process in mind the whole time and focusing on completing those smaller goals, and knew that if we kept working on those, that would help with our bigger goal.”
At NCAA regionals, softball appeared overmatched in its first two games. The team lost two of its most lopsided games of the year, falling to No. 10 Arizona, 10-0, before dropping its second game of the tournament to Texas Tech, 7-0, the following afternoon. Brown and Ricciardone both struggled early, and the Crimson could not catch up late.
In just two games, Harvard was eliminated from postseason play. But in spite of the losses, the season remains one of the best in the history of the program.

Though the Harvard women’s hockey team (17-11-4, 14-5-3 ECAC) got off to a slow, 5-6-3 start this season, the team came back rejuvenated after winter break just in time to turn things around. A six-game winning streak sparked the momentum needed to make a bid for the ECAC title.
“We started out [the season] a little timid but came together after Christmas break and put together a great run,” tri-captain forward Kate Buesser said. “Overall, there was huge improvement over the season, which was pretty impressive. I don’t think many people thought we would do as well as we did, and it was nice to exceed expectations.”
To prepare for games later in the year, Harvard started off its season playing a tough schedule, including ranked opponents such as Yale, Cornell, and Minnesota.
“We started off playing highly ranked opponents which is great,” senior forward Katharine Chute said. “Those are the types of games that help us develop in the long run.”
A major turning point in the season came in the team’s second contest against Quinnipiac, as Harvard earned a late victory with three third-period goals.
“We were down, 2-0, going into the third,” Buesser said. “We just regrouped in locker room and put on this [Jackson 5] song, ‘I Want You Back,’ which helped ease everyone out of whatever funk they were in. It got everyone to hold their sticks a little less tightly.”
“We were able to score three goals and win the game,” she continued. “We carried that momentum with us for the rest of the season.”
The three goals—two from freshman forward Kalley Armstrong and one from sophomore defender Josephine Pucci—came within eight minutes of each other, as a burst of Harvard domination proved too much for the Bobcats.
Harvard posted another strong showing in the Beanpot, staging a thrilling comeback in the first-round matchup that pitted Harvard against Northeastern. Down 3-0 with about five minutes elapsed in the second period, the Crimson pushed its way back to a 3-3 stalemate that held even after double overtime. Harvard claimed victory in the shootout, but BC ended the Crimson’s hopes of winning the Beanpot, taking down Harvard in the finals, 3-1.
“The games we played that were tied and we took to overtime, I think, define us as a team,” tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said. “We were behind and never stopped going, and we ended up winning most [of those games].”
In the ECAC tournament, the Crimson swept its quarterfinal matchup against St. Lawrence.
But a strong Dartmouth team eliminated Harvard in the semifinals of the ECAC tournament, 4-1, ending the Crimson’s 2010-2011 campaign.
A young lineup anchored the defense for the Crimson this year, as tri-captain defenseman Leanna Coskren is the only non-forward in her class.
“During the season, we had only one senior defensemen,” Pucci said. “The rest of us were either freshmen or sophomores, so there was a lot of opportunity for people to step up.”
The Crimson still depended on each of its six seniors for leadership, especially during the early stages of the season.
“I definitely think we got better as the season progressed,” Pucci said. “We had six seniors that were all strong presences on and off the ice. We all wish we could have gone a little further at the end, but we had a lot of games where we never gave up and came back.”
Despite a disappointing finish, team traditions remained strong as the Crimson reflected positively upon the year.
“One thing that has been really important on this team is leadership and preserving the traditions of the program,” Chute said. “The upperclassmen have put in a strong effort to try to communicate our traditions and pass them down to the freshmen.”
“Every year, the team has its own personality,” she continued. “I’m really thankful to everyone for making my senior year the best it could be, but not emphasizing that they were playing for the seniors. It’s really about all of us working toward a common goal.”

The 2010-2011 campaign was a landmark one for the Harvard softball team.
It earned an overall record of 36-16—a new school record—and took the Ivy League Championship for the fifth time against rival Cornell. The team also swept the Ancient Eight awards for only the second time in league history, with co-captain Ellen Macadam garnering Player of the Year, junior Rachel Brown unanimously taking Pitcher of the Year, and freshman Kasey Lange capturing Rookie of the Year.
With the record, the accolades, and the wins, this team seems pretty close to perfect. But as the saying goes, behind every great team is a great coach. Jenny Allard is that coach for the Crimson, and has been for 17 seasons, making her the Ivy League’s longest-tenured softball coach.
Allard has led Harvard softball to every one of its Ivy League titles—the Ancient Eight crown was the fifth for both the program and a coach who has been with the team for the better part of two decades.
But Allard’s success as a coach does not simply come from numbers or awards; it comes from her players’ value of her leadership.
“She’s really in tune with the team and has a great read on the team chemistry,” Brown said. “[The players] all know that she has a lot of coaching experience, and everyone on the team respects her decisions.”
“Coach has an infectious drive that inspires the team to work towards our goals,” junior Whitney Shaw added. “She provides for a solid basis on which we, as players and people, can grow and learn from the game.”
But even with this record-setting season, Allard remained unsatisfied as the regional competition of the NCAA tournament approached. Despite the blowout at regionals, this perfectionist attitude is nothing new, according to her players.
“When games are close and we didn’t play our best, she’s not satisfied,” Brown said. “There are always things to work on in the next practice.”
And this attitude won Allard and her team the title.
In addition to the fifth Ancient Eight trophy, Allard can now boast a 427-327-2 overall record, fives Players of the Year, four Pitchers of the Year, and three Rookies of the Year. She also guided the program to its inaugural berth to the NCAA tournament in 1998.
The record shows that the 2010-2011 Harvard softball team is great, but history shows that its coach might be even better.
“Right now, she is the Harvard softball program,” Brown said. “She has made this program into something incredible and has really put Harvard on the map in the Ivy League.”

Kasey Lange can hit.
Coming into her rookie season as one of the team’s most highly-touted recruits, Lange was expected to contribute to Harvard softball immediately.
But no one could have expected the year that the freshman third baseman just put together.
The Ivy League Rookie of the Year hit .444 with 11 home runs and 65 RBI, which ranked her second, second, and first in the Ivy League, respectively. She led the team in all three categories.
In addition, Lange also paced the Crimson squad in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and doubles.
“I think Kasey has done a great job of playing her game and not worrying about any externalities,” said junior first baseman Whitney Shaw. “She knows what she’s capable of and she has performed. She took everything in stride, which as a freshman is awesome. She’s very grounded.”
Already, she has left her mark on Harvard softball’s history books. Lange’s 68 hits are the third-highest single-season mark in the team’s history—co-captain and Ivy League Player of the Year Ellen Macadam broke the record this year with 76—and her .804 slugging percentage is also the third-highest for one season.
In the early part of the year, Lange put up solid numbers, particularly for a rookie. But it was in the second half of the year when she came into her own, cementing her candidacy for the Ancient Eight’s best first-year player.
Against the other Ivies, Lange dominated. In league play, she hit .522 with six home runs and 33 RBI. Once again, Lange led the team in average and RBI, and only six homers from sophomore Ashley Heritage in league play kept Lange from holding the outright lead in all three categories.
Lange—who twice won Ivy League Rookie of the Week in addition to her seasonal award—had a number of key performances down the stretch. In the final two regular-season games of the year, Lange went 6-for-8 with a home run and five RBI. In the Ivy League Championship Series, she failed to reach base just once, going 3-for-4 in the sweep.
“She’s the type of hitter that every time she steps in the box, she’s going to get a hit,” junior shortstop Jane Alexander said. “And if she doesn’t get a hit, then the next time she steps in the box, you better believe that she’s going to get a hit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down 3-0 to Northeastern midway through the second period of the Beanpot semifinals on Feb. 8, it seemed that the Harvard women’s hockey team would suffer its second Beanpot semifinal loss ever and its first since 2007.
Instead, the Crimson scored three goals in the final 30 minutes of ice time to tie the score at three and force a shootout. Goals by sophomores Jillian Dempsey and Josephine Pucci in the shootout gave Harvard the victory, propelling the team to the Beanpot finals.
The win at the Conte Forum was arguably the highlight of a season characterized by toughness, if not by the same success of seasons past. The shootout success gave the seniors their fourth trip in as many years to the Beanpot finals.
“I think it shows our team’s resilience and willingness to win,” tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said. “It showed the character of the team for the whole season. It was definitely a determining factor that showed us and showed other people that even when we’re down, we’re not just going to roll over and die.”
In the first period, the Crimson was outshot, 12-9, a rarity for the fast-paced Harvard team.
And the Crimson paid for it.
The Huskies were able to convert on their first power play of the game when Rachel Llanes scored nine-and-a-half minutes into the game. Two minutes later, Northeastern struck again. This time, it was Casey Pickett eluding sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy.
While the Huskies took an early lead by virtue of their aggressive play, it was their efficiency that helped them extend the lead into the second period.
Five minutes into the frame, Lori Antflick converted Northeastern’s only shot of the period to put the Huskies up by three.
But from then on, it was all Harvard.
Tri-captain Kate Buesser struck first, scoring 12 minutes into the second period.
“It don’t think anything had changed,” Ryabkina said. “A lot of teams, when they’re two goals down, they don’t expect to come back. No matter what the score says, we go until the last second. That game was a way for us to show exactly the kind of team we are.”
The Crimson hit its scoring stride just in the nick of time—when it was down two goals with five minutes of regulation remaining. Senior Ashley Wheeler and freshman Marissa Gedman scored within a minute of each other to force overtime.
“I think the idea with us is you never stop shooting,” Buesser said. “What it comes down [to] is anyone on our team can do it. Once we got [the first] goal, we knew it was time. I think we had been in that situation enough to relax and play our game.”
Harvard’s offense wasn’t the only thing to find its rhythm in the game’s waning moments. After struggling in the first and second periods, Bellamy stopped all five shots that came her way.
Harvard carried the momentum into overtime, but it wasn’t able to convert on any of its five shots. The Crimson’s defense was strong enough to prevent Northeastern from registering a single shot, which forced the game into a shootout.
The Huskies might have seemed to have had an advantage in a shootout. Their conference, Hockey East, uses shootouts to resolve tie games, and Northeastern had reached last year’s final with a shootout win over Boston University. But although Harvard didn’t have as much game experience with shootouts, the Crimson’s practices had prepared the team well.
“I think that we have quite a lot of practice with shootouts,” Ryabkina said. “People were kind of familiar with them.”
Goals from sophomore Jillian Dempsey and Huskies captain Alyssa Wohlfeiler forced sudden death.
And in the fourth round, Pucci broke the stalemate with a goal that put Harvard ahead for good.
“I think that overall hard work just really paid off,” Ryabkina said. “Jillian and Pucci did a great job.”
Bellamy sealed the deal with the final save to send the Crimson to the Beanpot finals.
“We had known ourselves as a pretty resilient team,” Buesser said. “It was kind of the personality of our team all year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After graduating just three seniors from a team that finished second in the Rolfe Division of the Ivy League, the Harvard men’s baseball team (9-36, 5-15 Ivy) looked to be a contender for the Ancient Eight crown at the onset of the 2011 season. But despite strengths in its lineup and a change in NCAA bat regulations that favored the Crimson’s hitting style, scoring ruts and inconsistencies plagued Harvard throughout the year.
“We definitely underperformed this season,” said senior right-handed pitcher Max Perlman. “We had high expectations going into the season, but there were still a lot of positives that came out of the year. I think the players who return next year realize what we need to work on and are optimistic about our chances.”
The Crimson got off to a rocky start, dropping its first nine games of the season in a Southeastern tour. Harvard picked up its first win of the year against Kennesaw State, as the Crimson overcame a 5-1 deficit in the last two innings to take the game, 10-6.
Harvard picked up two key Ivy League wins over Brown near the middle of its season. Despite dropping the first two contests in its two-day series against the Bears, the Crimson came back to win both Sunday games by an aggregate score of 18-10.
“The second day of the Brown series was really the only time our whole team played a full day of good baseball,” freshman outfielder Jack Colton said.
Harvard went on to earn six more wins, with a total of five against Ivy League teams, though several close contests went in favor of the Crimson’s opponents.
“We had moments where we showed what we’re capable of doing,” Colton said. “But we didn’t play at that level over the course of the whole season.”
In its last two doubleheaders of the season, Harvard dropped all four contests to the eventual Ivy League runner-up, Dartmouth.
“Our pitching [against] Dartmouth was great,” Perlman said. “Although we didn’t get the results we wanted, the team fought hard. That’s really something that defined our season.”
The Crimson lost 17 games by two or fewer runs this year, including a 12-inning heartbreaker at Penn. One bright spot for Harvard came in its penultimate series of the season against then-division leading Yale, as the Crimson claimed both nightcaps against its biggest rival to earn a split.
“The series against Yale was a big turning point in our season,” Perlman said. “Coming into the weekend, we knew this was the point where we would either turn the season around or fold. We played well on Saturday, but we were only able to pull out one of the games.”
Several individual members of the Harvard team exerted Ivy League dominance this season. Perlman and junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds each earned first-team All-Ivy honors for their performances this year. Perlman led the Ivy League with a 1.80 ERA and struck out 55 batters in 60 innings played. Reynolds held his own at the plate, batting .301 and notching 49 hits to help earn him the first-team nod. Junior designated hitter Marcus Way received an All-Ivy honorable mention at utility.
The Crimson also boasted a talented freshman class this season, with rookie third baseman Jake McGuiggan and Colton combining for 60 hits and 20 runs. Despite the disappointing year, Harvard looks forward to a promising future.
“I think most of [our younger players] are pretty excited about next season and ready to start getting on the field more and more,” Colton said. “Down the road, we’ll be able to be a pretty competitive team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2011 season was filled with a myriad of highs and lows for Harvard men’s lacrosse.
The team finished the year ranked No. 14 in the country, and its 10 wins were the most by a Crimson squad since 1998.
But at the same time, the season left an aura of unfulfilled potential.
And at the end of the day, Harvard continued to come up just short.
After barely losing numerous games during the regular season, the Crimson finished runner-up in the Ivy League, and just missed out on an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.
The year started with a home win over Canisius and a loss at Hofstra, the nation’s fifth-ranked team at the time.
Harvard then swept three consecutive home games against then-No. 20 Georgetown, Bellarmine, and Holy Cross, and won a big road contest at Brown. At 5-1 and ranked No. 17 in the country, the Crimson was off to its best start since 2000.
Then came the mid-season swoon. Harvard lost a heartbreaker at the buzzer to Dartmouth, and after a comeback victory over then-No. 16 UMass, the team dropped two more one-goal games in succession—12-11 to Albany and 13-12 to then-No. 6 Cornell—blowing late leads in each.
After beating Quinnipiac, the Crimson then suffered its most devastating defeat yet, a 7-6 loss in double overtime to then-No. 15 Penn.
But at the end of the season, Harvard turned it on again, emerging victorious in must-win Ivy contests at Princeton and versus then-No. 14 Yale on senior day to earn the third seed in the Ancient Eight tournament.
“We started coming together and playing well as a team, which led to our success at the end of the year,” freshman Daniel Eipp said. “Midseason, we had a little slump since we weren’t playing our game, but we were able to win some key games down the stretch.”
In the tournament’s first round, the Crimson got its revenge on the Quakers, dominating then-No. 15 Penn en route to a 12-8 win.
But in the championship at No. 2 Cornell, Harvard fell apart in the third quarter and couldn’t recover, losing by a score of 15-6.
With a win in any of its one-loss Ivy defeats, the Crimson would have likely earned an at-large bid to the 16-team NCAA Tournament. Instead, Harvard ended up widely considered to be the “last team out,” and the season was suddenly over.
But on the whole, it was a successful first year for rookie coach Chris Wojcik ’96, who took the reins of the Crimson after serving as an assistant at Penn and brought a new, fast-paced offensive system with him.
“He really gets what it’s about,” senior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “[The coaching transition] was pretty seamless. Obviously, it took a while to learn the new schemes, terminology, offensive and defensive plans and the like, but things came out pretty well."
“As he gets more familiar with the players and the players get more familiar with him, it’s only going to breed more success,” Parchman added.
The Crimson earned numerous individual accolades during the year as well.
Harvard was led by its co-captains, senior Dean Gibbons and junior Kevin Vaughan, who both were named to the All-Ivy first team. Gibbons was seventh in the country with 3.79 points per game and tenth with 1.86 assists per game. He paced the Crimson in those two categories—finishing with the ninth-most points in Harvard history—while also scoring 30 goals, one fewer than the team-leader, junior attack Jeff Cohen. Vaughan ranked third on the squad with 19 tallies and 27 points.
The Crimson also received a strong rookie performance from Eipp, whose 16 scores tied him for fourth on the team with sophomore Ryan Stevens. The freshman was named the NEILA Rookie of the Year, and earned All-Ivy honorable mention status along with junior defenseman Paul Pate, who led a defense that improved as the season went on in front of sophomore goaltender Harry Krieger.
But in the end, the desired level of success was not obtained.
“We set out some goals for the team—to win the Ivy League championship and make it to the NCAA Tournament—so we definitely came up short,” Eipp says. “We weren’t happy in that way, but we set a good ground for the upcoming season, and we have a lot to build off and look forward to next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2007, Max Perlman was a hotshot rookie pitcher for the Harvard baseball team. The Florida native was named a freshman All-American and garnered second-team All-Ivy status while leading the Crimson in wins, ERA, and complete games. He picked up a victory in his collegiate debut against Notre Dame and wowed the college baseball world by throwing 20 consecutive strikes in a complete-game three-hitter against Yale a month later.
Unsurprisingly, people expected big things from Perlman during his sophomore season. But before school had even begun, the starter was asked by the College to take a year’s leave of absence for disciplinary reasons, during which time he had surgery to fix bone spurs in his pitching elbow.
In 2009, after throwing 55 innings in the Cape Cod League over the summer, Perlman returned to Harvard with his repaired elbow well-tested. He was ready to retake his spot atop the Crimson’s rotation as the team’s ace.
But in Perlman’s first start of the year, an early March contest against Jacksonville State, the sophomore had to leave in the fourth inning with an elbow injury.
From his doctor, he then heard the two words that any pitcher most dreads—not home run or wild pitch, but Tommy John.
The infamous elbow surgery kept Perlman out the rest of his sophomore year, and most of his junior year as well.
“With the diagnosis, I knew it would be a 12-to-18 month recovery [after surgery],” Perlman said. “The process of rehabbing was slow, so I just had to be patient and put the work in.”
He finally returned at the end of the 2010 season, throwing just 15 innings in five starts and finishing with a 9.60 ERA. But coming into 2011, Perlman was finally completely healthy and ready to make the best of his senior year.
During the summer, Perlman again pitched in the Cape Cod League and was named to the league’s All-Star Game at Fenway Park.  Playing for the West team, Perlman threw a scoreless inning in the contest, and at the end of the summer—after finishing with a 1.92 ERA— he was named to the all-league squad.
As the spring of 2011 approached, he was again set to build on the success he had experienced as a freshman. No more distractions, no more injuries. Just a mound and a ball.
And this time, Perlman excelled.
The starter was one of the lone bright spots on a Harvard team that finished 9-36. An All-Ivy first-team selection, Perlman threw 60 innings and led the Ancient Eight with a miniscule 1.80 ERA—the only qualifying pitcher in the conference with an ERA under 2.00. He also had more strikeouts (55) than hits allowed (46).
“I had very high expectations going into [the season],” Perlman said. “This was especially true at the beginning of the year when we played Friday-Saturday-Sunday series instead of two-day series [near the end of the year]. Pitching Friday night games, I knew I was going up against the other team’s best pitcher and was going to have to step up and keep the team in the game. That really motivated me to push through.”
Perlman said he realized he was truly back during an early-season start against Charlotte, when he was locked in a 0-0 contest in the seventh inning. Though the Crimson lost that game, 2-0, Perlman was on the winning side of pitchers duels at other times as well.
Just as he did in his first-ever start against Yale, the starter dominated in his final performance against the Bulldogs, bringing his Harvard career full circle with a complete-game, 10-strikeout, four-hit shutout in a 1-0 Crimson victory.
“Coming into this year, we all knew he [would have a big impact],” freshman outfielder Jack Colton said. “He obviously tore up the Cape League in the summer…and shut down everyone this season. People just couldn’t hit the ball off of him.”
The senior had finally met the high expectations everyone had set for him after his outstanding rookie season. For Perlman, the success was better late than never.
“My doctor kept telling me that if I put the work in, it would pay off, and I could come back even stronger than before,” Perlman said. “I was very happy and fortunate that he was able to perform the surgery so well and give me a chance to come out again this year.”
It may have taken four years to get there, but Max Perlman was finally back on top.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a span of less than 48 hours, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team experienced an emotional rollercoaster.
Playing in the first round of the Ivy League tournament on May 6, the Crimson (10-6, 5-2 Ivy) was set to square off against No. 10 Dartmouth—a squad that dealt Harvard a 14-7 loss to in its regular season finale just one week prior.
But round two had a different outcome.
Trailing 9-8 with less than seven minutes to play, the Crimson needed one last push to keep its season alive. As it had done throughout the season, Harvard saved its best for last.
With 6:32 to go, junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind evened the score, going unassisted for the goal. Two more scores gave the Crimson its first lead since the contest’s opening minutes, and Harvard punched its ticket to the Ivy League championship game with an 11-10 victory.
But the championship contest two days later proved to be the end of the line.
Squaring off against a Princeton squad the Crimson had already defeated in the regular season, Harvard fell behind early, trailing 7-3 at halftime. The Crimson managed to get back into the game, pulling within one thanks to a 4-1 run to open the second frame.
And with 11:16 to play, sophomore Danielle Tetreault gave Harvard its first lead of the game, 10-9.
But the Crimson couldn’t hold on.
The Tigers answered 16 seconds later, and then regained the lead with 9:24 to play.
Princeton kept the Crimson off the scoreboard for the remainder of the contest, grabbing a 12-10 win and denying Harvard its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1994.
“It was disappointing,” Tetreault said. “It was a tough loss because it was a game we knew we could have won. I think it was a game that kind of got out of our reach. On another day, it could have ended differently, but it just wasn’t going for us that day.”
Despite the disappointing finish, the squad was pleased with the improvements it made during its 2011 campaign.
“It didn’t work out like we had hoped [in the championship], but we weren’t even there last year,” Baskind said. “To look at the strides that we made was pretty impressive, I think.”
In 2011, the Crimson finished with 10 victories—marking the first time it has reached double-figure wins since 1994—and reached the Ivy League Tournament after missing out on the inaugural competition by one game in 2010.
“I think we did very well this season,” Tetreault said. “We knew going into it we had the potential to be a great team and go far this year, and I think we showed that we matured throughout the year.”
Harvard was led by its potent attack, which featured six different players who finished the season with at least 10 goals. The Crimson finished the year atop the Ancient Eight in scoring average at 12.19 goals per game.
Sophomore attack Jennifer VanderMeulen led the conference in scoring for the second year in a row, while Tetreault finished third.
“’We’re so well rounded offensively,” Tetreault said. “Everyone on the attack is a threat, and when a team can’t just guard your star player, that really helps you.”
Behind its strong offense, the Crimson was able to hang with some of the nation’s top competition in 2011. Harvard fell by just a goal to then-No. 6 Stanford, then-No. 4 Penn, and then-No. 7 Virginia, while earning wins over then-No. 10 Dartmouth and then-No. 12 Princeton.
Returning all but one player—senior Sam McMahon—from its 2011 squad the future looks bright for the Crimson in 2012.
“I think [the 2011 season] was a big stepping stone,” Baskind said. “We’re at an exciting stage in the program and just really looking forward to the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When opponents focused on defending sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen, who has led the Ivy League in goals for two consecutive seasons, an opportunity opened up for her teammates to shine.
And sophomore midfielder Danielle Tetreault seized the chance to put up some results.
The midfielder finished the year second on the Harvard women’s lacrosse team with 42 scores, more than doubling her rookie effort and topping the Ivy League in free position goals. She also led the squad in assists for a combined 49 points.
“She definitely had a breakout season,” junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind said. “She worked really hard in the off-season. She’s taken up more of a leadership role and has been really helpful for our team this year.”
Although Tetreault played an integral part of the Harvard offense in her freshman year, tallying 20 goals and 10 assists, she had a far larger impact on the field this season.
“I think [VanderMeulen] had a lot of pressure on her since she had a great year last year… which opened a lot of us up to crash the goal and to step up,” Tetreault said.
Tetreault wasted no time in showing she would be an offensive threat in her sophomore season, contributing six goals in the Crimson’s opener against then-No. 6 Stanford.
But Tetreault was not just a threat on offense.
The midfielder was also a strong presence in Harvard’s defense, winning a team-high 29 draw controls, collecting 15 ground balls, and causing seven turnovers.
“In order to be successful as a midfielder, you have to pick up on things really quickly since you are splitting your time between the offense and the defense,” Baskind said. “[Tetreault] is an awesome dodger and is helpful on the attack, but the fact that she can go back and forth so quickly from offense to defense says a lot about her.”
Tetreault’s efforts did not go unnoticed, as she was named to the All-Ivy League second team and earning a spot on the Ivy League All-Tournament team in the Ivy League Tournament.
But she doesn’t want to stop there.
“My confidence grew this year,” Tetreault said. “When you come in your freshman year, the change to college is a big adjustment. It helps to have a year of experience knowing what it is like to play at the college level. Next year, I want to continue to improve my role as a midfielder through transitions and the tough breaks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the inception of Ivy League basketball in the 1955-1956 season, 54 Harvard men’s basketball teams had attempted to win a conference title. Every single one of them failed.
During those 54 years, Penn won the league 23 times. Princeton was victorious in 22 seasons. Cornell won the title on four occasions, Yale and Dartmouth were triumphant three times, and Columbia and Brown took one title each. Only the Crimson had never been an Ancient Eight champion in men’s basketball.
But in 2010-11, team number 55 claimed its spot in the record books.
It was a season to remember for Harvard, which won a program-best 23 games and set school records for conference victories with 12 and home wins with 14—in 14 contests.
And on March 5, the squad topped Princeton, 79-67, at Lavietes Pavilion to earn its first-ever share of the Ivy Crown. After losing the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament on a heartbreaking buzzer-beater against the Tigers a week later, the Crimson earned its first-ever invite to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) and became the first Ivy League school to be offered a spot in the NIT since 2003.
“We accomplished part of our goal, which was to win the Ivy League title,” said junior co-captain and forward Keith Wright. “To be able to make history happen is part of the reason why we chose to come here, all of us, and as a whole I think [the season] went really well.”
Along the way, Harvard beat major-conference foes Colorado by 16 points and Boston College by nine. It was the third straight year the Crimson toppled the Eagles in Chestnut Hill, as Harvard emerged as the best college basketball team in the Boston area.
“I think a lot of things clicked for us early,” said junior co-captain and guard Oliver McNally. “Our team got along great on and off the court. The camaraderie on the team really helped us throughout [the season], and everybody stepped up and made a lot of plays.”
Other than a one-point defeat at Yale, every other loss the Crimson suffered during the regular season was to a future NCAA Tournament team, including eventual national champion UConn.
The year ended with Harvard’s first-ever appearance on ESPN, a game in which the Crimson fell, 71-54, at Oklahoma State in the NIT’s first round.
Nonetheless, the squad’s 12-2 conference record marked an impressive turnaround for a program that had been 3-11 in Ivy play just three years prior.
That season had been the first at the helm for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, who came to Harvard planning to make history and did so faster than anyone expected. Coaching for the first time this year with a roster composed solely of his recruits, Amaker turned a program with a history of futility into a squad that was one of the top 35 in the country in terms of RPI by the year’s end.
Five players averaged double figures in points for the Crimson, which led the Ancient Eight in scoring offense, scoring margin, field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage, and three-point percentage.
The squad was led by Wright, who won the Ivy League Player of the Year award after pacing Harvard with 14.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game.
Wright’s frontcourt mate, sophomore forward Kyle Casey, came back from an early-season injury to earn second-team All-Ivy status after averaging 10.7 points and 6.0 rebounds. He was joined on the second team by classmate Brandyn Curry, who scored 9.3 points per contest and led the Ancient Eight in assists per game with 5.9.
Sophomore Christian Webster earned All-Ivy honorable mention status after averaging 13.0 points per contest. Fellow wing Laurent Rivard had an impressive freshman season and averaged 11.0 points, and McNally added 10.1 points per game while finishing second in the nation in free-throw percentage.
“We got out and ran and were patient and unselfish with the ball on offense,” McNally said. “[And] we were a tough defensive team.”
The Crimson returns its entire roster in 2011-2012 and is expected to be the heavy favorite to make its first Big Dance since 1946.
“We didn’t finish the season like we wanted to,” freshman guard Matt Brown said. “We wish things had gone another way, but we’re already right back in the gym and ready to achieve new levels of success next year.”
Though that success will have to wait, nothing can take away one fact.
For the first time ever, Harvard was a champion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clinging to a five-point lead with 2:11 to play against crosstown rival Boston College, the Harvard men’s basketball team was in need of a basket. The Eagles had cut the Crimson’s 11-point lead to five in less than two minutes, and momentum was swinging away from the visiting Harvard squad.
That’s when rookie Laurent Rivard stepped up.
With the shot clock winding down, junior co-captain Keith Wright received the ball in the high post. As the Eagles sent a double team at Wright, Rivard cut to the basket, took a pass from Wright, and finished a lefty layup to put the Crimson back up by seven.
It was fitting that Rivard—the player who had carried the Crimson all night—would be the one to seal the victory.
The 6’5” guard finished the game with a career-high 23 points, shooting 7-of-15 off the bench.
“He was really putting the team on his back,” said sophomore point guard Brandyn Curry of Rivard’s performance in the Jan. 5 matchup against the Eagles.  “He carried us, man. That was very impressive. In such a big moment, for a freshman to step up and do that, I was really impressed.”
But given his collegiate debut, some may not have believed that Rivard had what it took to lead the Crimson against an ACC opponent.
In his first game in a Harvard uniform, Rivard—a highly touted recruit with a sweet shooting touch—struggled mightily. In 23 minutes, the guard went 0-of-11 from the field, missing seven shots from beyond the arc in the Crimson’s 66-53 season-opening loss to George Mason.
When Harvard returned to Cambridge that night and the rest of the Crimson players went to sleep, Rivard went straight to the gym to work on his jump shot.
“I think when we got back, he didn’t even go to sleep. He just went back to the gym,” Curry said. “He is in the gym constantly, working on his game.”
Soon enough, the hard work began to pay off for the freshman. Rivard reached double figures in his third game and led the Crimson in scoring over a three-game stretch leading up to the start of Ivy League play.
In the most successful season in Harvard basketball history, Rivard finished third on the team in scoring, averaging 11 points per game, while leading the squad in three pointers with 61.
Perhaps more impressive, Rivard emerged as a clutch player to whom the Crimson went in pressure situations.
“For a freshman, this year he played with unbelievable swagger,” sophomore Kyle Casey said. “He really got the job done for us.”
“His confidence is through the roof; that’s why in late games, whenever we need a three, Coach is always ready to call his number,” Curry echoed. “He’s one of the best shooters in the league already…and he still has a long way to go, which is scary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four seasons into Traci Green’s tenure as head coach of Harvard women’s tennis, she had turned the team around. In the 2008-2009 season, the team finished 2-17. Last year, Harvard finished second place in the Ivy League, meriting an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
But the sharp upward rise of the Harvard women’s tennis team took a dip this year. Finishing 9-9 overall (4-3 Ivy) and without an NCAA berth, the squad feels as if it underachieved.
“It was a bit disappointing this season because we had...expectation[s] to make the NCAAs,” co-captain Samantha Rosekrans said. “That was our goal to start. So, it was disappointing in that sense.”
Starting with a No. 44 ITA ranking, the Crimson opened the season with a 5-2 win against cross-town rival Boston University.
But Harvard was handed losses by No. 20 Northwestern and No. 38 Boise State in its next matches during the ITA Division I Kickoff Weekend.
The Crimson turned around and bested Boston College, 5-2. But directly after, the team was upset by No. 71 Maryland, 6-1. Only junior co-captain Holly Cao, who was ranked 45th in singles in the nation at the time, won her match at the No. 1 spot.
Harvard regained some momentum for its next three matches at the ECAC Division I Indoor Team Championship in Princeton, N.J. There, the Crimson faced three Ancient Eight squads before the Ivy season began. Despite a string of recent struggles, Harvard opened the tournament strongly, beating Cornell, 6-1. But the team couldn’t hold onto its success, falling to No. 40 Yale and unranked Brown.
After splitting matches against No. 75 William & Mary and No. 63 Purdue, then-No. 51-ranked Harvard looked to get its season back on track as it traveled to Northern California for Spring Break.
Over the course of the week, the Crimson was scheduled to play No. 7 California, San Francisco, and No. 48 St. Mary’s, but inclement weather caused the games against the Golden Bears and the Gaels to be cancelled. Harvard made the best of what it was given, beating the Dons, 6-1.
Weather continued to frustrate the Crimson even after the trip, as its last scheduled game before the start of the Ivy League season was also cancelled, meaning the Crimson only played one match in the five weeks leading up to Ivy play.
The lack of matches did not seem to be a factor for Harvard, which began its quest for an Ivy League title by beating Cornell, Columbia, and Penn, respectively.
But its streak came to an end against No. 49 Princeton. The Crimson and the Tigers split the singles matches 3-3, but Princeton pulled out the win thanks to the doubles point.
“In the Princeton match, the critical thing was the doubles point,” said sophomore Kristin Norton, who is a co-captain for the 2011-2012 season. “So, after that we started working on doubles. We did more doubles drills during practice. We switched partners around. We worked on different strategies...And our doubles improved.”
Norton and her doubles partner, sophomore Hideko Tachibana, won their next match together against No. 36 Yale at the No. 1 spot, but Harvard’s No. 2 and No. 3 pairs lost, giving the Bulldogs the doubles point.
Unlike the match against the Tigers, the doubles point was not the deciding factor against Yale. The Bulldogs coasted to a victory over the Crimson, 6-1.
With two losses and only two games left in the season, the pursuit of the Ivy League title looked to be cut short.
Despite the long odds of taking the crown, the team still competed in tight matches, beating No. 45 Brown in the team’s next contest, 4-3, on a decisive doubles point.
“[The Brown match] didn’t really matter in the scheme of things because our record wasn’t good enough to win Ivy League, but it gave us a lot of confidence and showed us that we have the talent to compete with the higher level teams,” Rosekrans said.
The Crimson finished with a home contest against No. 56 Dartmouth. Harvard took the doubles point to open the contest, but only Cao and Tachibana won their singles matches at the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively. After the Big Green’s 4-3 victory over the Crimson, Harvard finished the season with a No. 64 ranking.
Though the team did not finish as well as it had hoped, three players were recognized for their individual play.
Cao, who is ranked No. 65 in the nation in singles play, was unanimously selected to the All-Ivy singles first team. She went 15-1 in dual matches this season, falling only to the Ivy League Player of the Year, Penn’s Connie Hsu.
Norton and Tachibana also received unanimous selections. The duo was named to the All-Ivy doubles first team after going 11-6 in dual matches and 6-1 in the Ancient Eight.
Tachibana was also named to the All-Ivy singles second team for her work at the No. 2 spot.
“We saw some growth as a team, especially in some individual players,” Norton said. “Next year we’ll just have to work harder and stay confident.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than 10 seconds left on the clock, Harvard needed someone to step up and make a shot to avoid a one-point loss to Columbia. The  conference defeat would have dealt an early blow to the Crimson’s title aspirations.
Junior point guard Brogan Berry saw the clock winding down and looked down the court to dish the ball to someone with a good look at the basket. Berry saw an open Christine Clark on the right side and immediately passed the ball to the rookie. Clark fumbled the ball but quickly composed herself and took the jumper.
With three and a half seconds left, Clark sank the shot to give the Crimson a 69-68 win.
“For her to make that shot and not have us be upset in the in the first away weekend of Ivy League play was a really big moment for us,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “Christine’s shot was the most important shot for us up to that point in the season.”
The clutch basket is indicative of the type of season the rookie enjoyed. From the very beginning, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith trusted the freshman with a spot in the starting lineup, and Clark never let her coach down, starting all 28 games. She finished the season fourth on the team in scoring with 12.1 points per game and second in rebounding, averaging 4.7 boards.
“She’s a huge part of our team,” sophomore Victoria Lippert said. “She’s very explosive off the dribble, and she’s only going to get better with time.”
The rookie would take over games from time to time, establishing herself as a serious scoring threat in the league. Against the Lions the second time around, Clark punished Columbia with 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting. The rookie shot 50.6 percent on the season, a remarkable statistic for a first-year player learning the ropes in the conference.
“I can’t recall any obstacles [to becoming part of] the team because everyone is just so nice and the team always comes first, no matter what,” Clark said. “Learning to play college basketball—Division I in the Ivy League—was somewhat of an obstacle because I needed to adjust to that level of play.”
Her teammates are confident Clark will continue developing as a player and come back next season improved and ready.
“She’s young, and any mistakes that she’s made can be completely interpreted to the fact that she’s only a freshman,” Matera said. “I know just from experience this year that she’s going to grow as a player, and she’s going to work hard all summer going into next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just like the top of men’s professional tennis, the competition in Ivy League men’s tennis was intense this year. And just as top players such as Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have struggled against the dominant forces of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the past, the Harvard tennis team’s best was not enough to defeat its toughest Ivy League opponents.
Despite an overall 15-10 record in this year’s dual season, Harvard’s 5-5 conference play did not allow the squad to capture the Ivy League crown or qualify for the NCAA Championships.
“There’s no question that everybody, one through six, was putting it on the line, day in and day out, and as a coach, that’s what you hope for,” said Crimson assistant coach Andrew Rueb. “Certainly it was disappointing to not win the title, and that was our goal, but we’ll just have to keep raising the bar.”
Although the team fell short of its ultimate goal, there was one player who was able to stand out and earn Ivy League recognition.
After transferring from Brown University, junior Jon Pearlman had a rough start in the fall season but quickly turned things around in the spring. Pearlman earned an 11-11 record playing at the No. 1 singles position the entire season and capped his season off with the first-team All-Ivy accolades.
“I was satisfied with my performance this year,” Pearlman said. “I felt a little nervous with the transition at the beginning of the year, but I felt it went smoothly. By spring…I was definitely playing my best tennis of the year.”
Pearlman also amassed a 14-7 doubles record in the dual season, finding success with two different partners, freshman Casey MacMaster and sophomore Josh Tchan. At one point, Pearlman won nine straight matches, four with MacMaster and five with Tchan.
MacMaster, another source of new blood, performed consistently well on the team this year, and he gives the Crimson a promising future. MacMaster worked his way to the No. 4 position on the squad in singles after beginning the season out of the starting lineup. Out of his nineteen matches played, MacMaster only dropped five, and held the team’s longest undefeated streak in singles with seven straight victories.
He proved to be an equally strong competitor in doubles. Teaming up with Pearlman at the beginning of the semester, the duo earned a 6-2 record, but MacMaster moved up midway through the season to partner with captain Aba Omodele-Lucien at the No. 1 slot. The new pair finished off the spring with an even 7-7 record.
In contrast to the new players on the team, junior Ali Felton is a seasoned veteran playing in his third year with the squad. Playing at the No. 3 position, Felton earned an 11-12 record.
Felton also paired up again with his doubles partner from last year, sophomore Andy Nguyen. The pair started off the year in the fall with an 11-4 record in tournament play, defending their Northeast Regional doubles title, but slipped at the end to the No. 3 slot on the team and finished the dual season with an 11-11 record.
“It’s hard to always keep [the chemistry between doubles partners] going and [Felton and Nguyen] needed to build some confidence,” Rueb said. “I think, as coaches, if we would have let them play a few more matches at No. 3, they would have been able to gain more confidence.”
Omodele-Lucien, another seasoned veteran, played in his final season for Harvard. Competing at the No. 2 slot for most of the season, Omodele-Lucien at one point stood with an 8-6 record, but lost his last three dual matches of the season to finish 8-9.
In doubles, Omodele-Lucien posted a 13-9 record with partners Tchan and MacMaster and at one point held a six-match winning streak against his opponents. Omodele-Lucien finished off his doubles career with a 72-52 record.
Although the squad loses two seniors, Omodele-Lucien and Alexei Chijoff-Evans, the Crimson returns most of its roster, giving it a chance at an Ivy League title in the 2011-2012 season.
But just like for Djokovic against Nadal and Federer, the pieces will have to fall into place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The young Harvard women’s volleyball team struggled mightily at the onset of its season but finished the year on a high note, winning four of its last seven games.
“We had a pretty young team with two seniors, three juniors, five sophomores, and five freshmen,” junior Christine Wu said. “Before the season we were wondering what kind of potential we would have, but despite being young, we had a solid year.”
The Crimson’s (9-17, 6-8 Ivy) lack of experience and limited time to incorporate freshmen resulted in a rough stretch to start the year.
“Volleyball is a very mental game,” junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll said. “We have a lot of talent on our team now, and we have always had. I think something that is really important is having the mentality of winning and doing whatever it takes to win. The season is so short, and we don’t get our full team together with all the freshmen till August.”
After a five-set victory against Bryant in the second game of the season, the team fell into a rut, losing nine of its next 10 matches, including seven straight. At the end of 14 contests, Harvard had only won twice.
The squad finally rebounded after the rough stretch, winning three of its next four games, including a dramatic five-set win over New Hampshire to break the losing streak.
After briefly relapsing into its losing ways, the Crimson proceeded to finish the year on a high note, including a 3-2 win over the Tigers on Senior Night.
“We had some ups and downs [in the season],” Ingersoll said. “We had a great game against Princeton. We really found our team dynamic and found an energy that we needed to bring to more games to be more successful as a whole. Those little moments were exciting for us.”
In the match, Princeton forced a fifth set, but Harvard was able to prevail in the end.
“That game was amazing [and a] great way for our two seniors, Miyoko [Pettit] and Mikaelle [Comrie], to close out their careers,” Wu said. “Both of them had lights-out games. We remembered how heartbreaking it was in the first loss [to Princeton], and we knew what it took to beat them.”
Cormie collected 20 kills in the win, one shy of her career high, while Pettit tallied a personal-best 17 digs in the contest.
Harvard will look to build off the momentum gained at the end of the season as a springboard for next season.
“I think it was important for us to end on that kind of note, just to prove what we can do and show what kind of level we should be playing at,” Ingersoll said. “We only have a few months together, and so [it’s important] to take note when you have great games and wins like the Princeton win and [learn] from that. I think that’s definitely something we will take into next season.”
Next year, the Crimson returns most of its top players. Sophomore Taylor Docter paced the team with 198 kills, while Ingersoll and junior Sandra Lynne Fryhofer were close behind with 190 and 186 kills, respectively. Fryhofer was also selected to  the second-team All-Ivy League. All three athletes will be prominent in Harvard’s front line next season. Wu recorded 449 digs on the season and will resume her post as the team’s libero in the 2011 campaign.
“[Fryhofer], Wu, and I we came in together as freshman with big goals and high expectations for the program,” Ingersoll said. “As seniors, we are in a good spot to set that tone for the rest of the team. We are really excited. It’s our last shot at an Ivy title. The three of us have started since freshman year so its now or never.”
“This is our year,” Ingersoll added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard coach Tommy Amaker left Michigan to take the helm of the Crimson men’s basketball team, he inherited a Harvard squad that notched just five conference wins in the 2006-2007 season. But in four short years, Amaker has led the Crimson to league and national relevance, punctuated by Harvard’s first ever Ivy League title this season.
“[It’s been] amazing [playing for him],” freshman guard Matt Brown said. “It’s one of those experiences where the stuff we learn from him and observe from him is something we’ll cherish the rest of our lives.”
There’s no denying Amaker’s impact on his players. This season, the Crimson set a school record with 23 wins, including a perfect 14-0 record in Cambridge at Lavietes Pavilion. The young Harvard team—which was the only squad in the Ancient Eight comprised entirely of non-seniors—is the early favorite for a repeat championship next season.
“On a basketball team, just like in a lot of sports, the team represents the coach,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “He gets us to play a certain way, and we represent what he wants us to do.”
This year, the Crimson played a fast-paced, exciting style of basketball, dominating its opponents in front of packed crowds at home, while managing to also excel from the free throw line. Harvard shot nearly 81 percent from the charity stripe, a full six percentage points ahead of its nearest competitor in the Ancient Eight. The Crimson also led the league in field goal and three-point percentage, with .475 and .378 marks, respectively.
With Amaker in charge, four Harvard players earned All-Ivy nods, the most of any Ancient Eight team. The Crimson earned a share of the Ivy League title at home in early March, as Harvard took down Princeton by a comfortable margin of 79-67 in the highly-anticipated rematch of the Crimson’s first conference loss.
In the teams’ third and final duel, which pitted the newly-crowned Ivy League co-champions against one another, Princeton hit a buzzer-beater to rob Harvard of its first spot in the NCAA Tournament since 1946. But the Crimson earned a consolation prize, receiving its first-ever bid to the NIT this year.
To the team, responsibility for the rapid turnaround lies with the head coach.
“[Amaker’s] our main guy,” said junior co-captain and forward Keith Wright, who took home Ivy League Player of the Year honors this season. “He’s our leader; he’s in charge; he’s like the commander-in-chief. I definitely learned a lot from him.”
For players deciding whether or not to forgo potential athletic scholarships and play in the Ivy League, Amaker provides a huge draw, allowing Harvard to snag big-time recruits and continue to develop its program. And, though the Crimson last reached the Big Dance in 1946, a starting lineup featuring three sophomores—Kyle Casey, Brandyn Curry, and Christian Webster—boasts both youth and experience.
“[Amaker’s] a big-time coach, big-time recruiter...everything that he does I think we all learn from him,” Brown said. “He learned from Coach K at Duke, who’s an amazing person, and hopefully we can carry on the tradition of learning as much as we can from him.”
Under Amaker’s guidance, Harvard set new school records with 12 conference wins and 14 victories in Cambridge this year, and the Crimson earned a spot in postseason play for the second year in a row.
But for many of his players, Amaker’s impact extends beyond the court.
“As a player and as a person he’s been like a father figure to me,” Wright said. “Being from a household with a single mom has been tough; it’s been really nice to have Coach Amaker to talk to, as well as [assistant] coach [Kenny] Blakeney, so he means a lot to me.”

First-year head coach Ted Minnis led the 2010 Harvard men’s water polo team to the most victories in a season since 2007. The Crimson (12-16, 2-5 CWPA) earned third place at the first-ever Ivy Championship and finished the year with a fifth-place finish at the Collegiate Water Polo Association Northern Division Championship.
“I’m really proud of our guys,” Minnis said. “You saw us get better every day.”
“We had a really exceptional team this season,” co-captain Bret Voith added. “Both individually and as a team, we took big steps from last year. I think it was a combination of our new coaching staff and the veterans of the team coming together to form a new culture.”
And the veterans did lead the team. Throughout the season, three seniors, Jeff Lee, Alex Thompson, and Voith headed Harvard’s pursuit of wins.
The senior attackers Lee and Voith set the pace for the Crimson in goals, each netting 38 for the season. Thompson followed with 34 goals. As a defender, he led the team with 49 steals on the year.
“We have a big class to fill with the senior class that’s graduating,” Minnis said.
Both Thompson and Voith earned CWPA North Division Player of the Week honors.
A fourth senior, Eric Taylor, who was added to the roster from the swim team, helped the team when injuries left gaps in the squad. Two sophomores,  Antone Martinho and Max Eliot, were out for almost the duration of the season.
“There were many times we were low on numbers due to injuries, but we still found ways to dig deep and play hard,” Lee said.
Throughout the season, Harvard relied on its speed.
“One of our strengths is definitely our speed,” Lee said. “We can swim as fast if not faster than most teams in the country, and that’s something we are proud of.”
Midseason, the Crimson took a trip to California for a five-game weekend, playing against top-ranked teams.
“It was a big testing point for us,” Voith said.
Returning to the home state of 10 of the 16 men on the roster proved to be a relative success, as the team came away from the weekend with a 2-3 mark. The loss against Pomona-Pitzer was especially close, with Harvard narrowly falling, 10-9.
“This year’s trip really showed [that] all the work was paying off,” Voith said.
During the trip, the Crimson faced No. 5 UC Santa Barbara. Though they couldn’t come back from a 11-3 deficit, Harvard had a strong showing in the fourth quarter, matching the Gauchos in goals.
“Those close games against UCSB and Pomona showed that we are a lot more competitive,” Voith said.
“Once we all got on the same page, we were successful,” Minnis added.
Certain players were successful all year long, garnering player-of-the-week awards as well as CWPA Scholar-Athlete honors.
“What you see is a significant amount of work in the offseason,” Voith said. “Guys are really focusing and committing to improve themselves and the team.”
For next year, the Crimson is looking to improve on its record and continue to grow as it did this year.
“Princeton and Brown are two Ivy teams that we would love to beat,” Minnis said. “Every game is going to be a great challenge for us—I’m excited.”
Leading the team next year is returning co-captain junior Luka Babic and the team’s 2010 Most Improved Player, junior Kevin DiSilvestro. Together the two had 46 goals, 28 assists, and 37 steals.
“The team is losing half of the starting line-up, so there will be a very different feel,” Voith said. “Hopefully, we’ve built some hunger for the guys still on the team.”
“The other seniors and I are proud to have established a strong foundation with Coach Minnis in his first year for the program to grow tremendously in the next couple years,” Lee added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One was the essence of euphoric jubilation. The other the definition of heartbreaking anguish.
Two games against the Princeton Tigers defined a record-breaking 2010-2011 season for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
On Saturday evening, March 4, 2011, Lavietes Pavilion was the site of what was the deemed the biggest game in Crimson basketball history. Numerous celebrities—Harvard President Drew Faust, ESPN’s Bill Simmons, Rockets GM Daryl Morey, and former Crimson star Jeremy Lin ’10 among them—were part of a sold-out crowd hungry to witness Harvard clinch at least a share of the first-ever Ivy League title in the conference’s nearly 60-year history.
And the home team did not disappoint.
Sophomore forward Kyle Casey led the way with a season-high 24 points, including a one-handed baseline dunk that sent the stadium into a frenzy early in the second half.
“It gave us incredible momentum,” sophomore guard Brandyn Curry said after the game. “I saw him set up for a three, and I thought, ‘This is going to be ugly.’ But then he went in for a ‘SportsCenter’ dunk. I think that changed the game.”
After Princeton cut the Harvard lead to five with five minutes to go, Curry made an acrobatic basket and knocked in the ensuing free throw to complete a three-point play, and junior co-captain Keith Wright added a layup on the next Crimson possession to push the lead to 10 with 4:22 remaining.
Harvard never looked back, and hit its free-throws down the stretch to seal the 79-67 victory. After a Tiger miss on the game’s final possession, junior co-captain Oliver McNally grabbed the rebound and heaved the ball into the air as the Crimson student section stormed the court in celebration.
For the first time in the program’s history, Harvard was a champion.
“This was something that has never been done,” Casey said after the game. “A lot of people have tried, come close, and put in a lot of work and determination to try to do what we’ve done this season so far. It was beyond just our team and our players and our coaching staff; it was for everyone that’s been through this program.”
Princeton took care of business against Penn to clinch their share of the title the following Tuesday, setting up a one-game playoff between the league co-champions on March 12 for the right to go to the NCAA Tournament.
The game—played at a neutral site, Yale’s John J. Lee Amphitheater—was a back-and-forth affair early on, but Harvard soon grabbed the lead. After the Crimson raced out to a nine-point second half advantage, it looked destined to reach the Big Dance for the first time since 1946.
But the Tigers would not go away, and fought back to pull ahead. After a Casey layup put Harvard back up with 1:01 left, Princeton’s Ian Hummer answered on the other end, giving the Tigers a 61-60 lead with 38 seconds remaining.
On the next Crimson possession, Curry attacked the basket and attempted a short floater that bounced around the rim before falling, putting Harvard up, 62-61, with 11 seconds to go.
Princeton junior guard Doug Davis took the inbound and went streaking down the court, attempting a running floater that was blocked out-of-bounds by Casey.
With 2.8 seconds on the clock, the Tigers called a time-out to set up the play that changed the entire dynamic of the Crimson season and turned a great game into a classic.
Princeton senior Dan Mavraides took the ball from the referee behind the right of the basket. Davis came around McNally on the left, 12 feet from the hoop, and took a pass. He took two dribbles right and pump-faked as McNally leaped in an attempt to contest the shot.
But Davis hadn’t released. Instead, he ducked under McNally as Harvard’s co-captain reached back in desperation with his left arm. But it was too late. Falling left, Davis released a fade-away jumper as the clock hit zero. The ball hit nothing but nylon, sending McNally’s head into his jersey in despair and leading the Princeton faithful to storm the court—just as the Crimson student section had one week earlier.
“I thought we played a tremendous game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said afterwards. “We played with a great deal of heart and passion, as [the Tigers] did...we’re certainly heartbroken and devastated as you can imagine being on the [losing] end.”
Those two contests against the Tigers defined the Crimson’s record-setting season.
Separately, they represent the rapid ebbs and flows that often arise in competitive sports. But together, their impact changed basketball at Harvard forever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in September, Harvard women’s water polo welcomed head coach Ted Minnis and assistant Jessi Wood to its program along with five talented freshman contributors, and the team has not been the same since.
These new additions helped the Crimson (17-15, 2-3 CWPA) transform its declining program into a growing threat in the Southern Conference throughout the year.
Harvard ended the season with a sixth-place finish at the CWPA Eastern Championships, the team’s highest finish since 2005 and a signal of the progress the team has been making.
“Our key was that everyone was on the same page the whole season,” Minnis said. “The main thing was that we had a road map of what we wanted to accomplish, and we did [it].”
The Crimson won its most games this year since the 2004-2005 campaign, and the team capped the season two places higher than it did in 2010.
Minnis credits a changed mentality on the team as one of the major contributors to Harvard’s turnaround. As he and many of his players said several times throughout the season, the Crimson worked to force opponents to adjust to its style of play.
“If we tried adjusting every time to what other people were doing, then we would just end up trying to counter to everyone else,” Minnis said. “We knew what we were going to run, and we ran it all the time. Eventually, we got more comfortable in the system and began to add some new layers.”
Minnis made an immediate impact on the team by implementing this strategy as well as several other logistical changes to the lineup when he joined the program.
“What I think is amazing about our team this year in comparison to last year is that not only do we have a new coach who has a system that we’re supposed to be running, but we were able to pick it up so quickly,” junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski said.
Junior co-captain Devan Kennifer led Harvard’s charge this season. She proved to be a force on both sides of the ball by racking up 76 goals on offense and 81 steals on defense, a showing that earned her the team’s MVP award.
“Devan Kennifer had a tremendous year,” Minnis said. “She did a great job leading this year, but Devan will be the first to say that she didn’t do it all by herself. It was definitely a huge team effort.”
Zdrojewski, sophomore attacker Aisha Price, and junior goalie Laurel McCarthy largely aided in this team effort by making significant improvements between seasons. Zdrojewski and Price had nearly identical jumps in statistics between 2010 and 2011: both improved their goal counts by nearly 30 and added an extra 30 assists to their total counts as well.
Meanwhile, McCarthy earned the team’s Most Improved award and solidified her status as a starter by making 184 saves in the season.
As the season progressed, the talented class of freshmen quickly proved to be a valuable new asset to the team. Scoring about 18 percent of the team’s goals, the freshmen added great depth to the team. Shayna Price, winner of the Rookie of the Year award, headed the freshmen squad, finishing in the top five on the team in goals, steals, and assists.
Many of the players on the Crimson’s team credit the spring break trip to California as the turning point of the season. Although Harvard went 2-5 over the week, it played several top-10 team including Cal and San Jose State, both of whom the Crimson came within a few goals of beating. Facing such tough competition helped prepare Harvard for the East Coast teams facing the Crimson in its conference.
“Our record sounds pretty abysmal in California, but I think we played really well there,” Kennifer said. “Even though we had a four-game losing streak, we were playing such high-quality teams and playing against them so well. I think it was relieving, for one thing, to know that we brought that [quality] back from California.”
Harvard, which graduates only two seniors this year, has much room for improvement upon its sixth-place finish. The team saw this season as, if nothing else, a time to build.
“We bring back a group of seniors looking for their last ‘hoorah’ next year,” Minnis said. “This year got us going in the right direction, but we have four kids coming in that I’m really excited about. We set the bar really high, but I think it’s definitely easy to get over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Third time’s the charm, they say.
But for the third straight year, the Harvard women’s basketball team (18-10, 10-4 Ivy) came up short in its pursuit of the Ivy title, landing in the all-too-familiar second spot along with an up-and-coming Yale squad. Princeton took home the league crown for the second year in a row.
“We were hoping to build on the solid 20 wins we had last season,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “Unfortunately, that didn’t pan out the way we wanted it to. We worked hard every practice to try to make that a reality, but we fell a little short.”
After a rollercoaster start to the 2010-2011 campaign where it alternated wins and losses for several weeks, the Crimson shot its way past its first five conference opponents of the season before traveling to New Haven for its first meeting with the Bulldogs on Feb. 11.
Harvard had just come out of a weekend in which it demonstrated its clear intentions to win the league with two dominant performances against Penn defending Ivy champion Princeton.
Yale was not fazed and handed the Crimson its first conference loss of the campaign. Harvard then dropped its game against Brown the following day, putting its chances to take home the title in serious jeopardy.
“We suffered two losses that we didn’t expect, especially because we were undefeated in the league up to that point,” sophomore forward Victoria Lippert said. “We were coming off a great weekend against Penn and Princeton, so that was like going from a high to a low in a span of two weekends.”
The Crimson returned home to add three more wins to its conference record by defeating Cornell, Columbia, and the Bears. The Bulldogs were up next, and Harvard was set on not only defending its home court but also avenging the 11-point loss it had suffered only two weeks before. The effort was unsuccessful, as Yale took control of the contest in the first period and never looked back, winning, 78-64, and taking the season series against the Crimson.
The loss meant that Harvard would have to win all of its remaining three games—all on the road and one of which was against the Tigers—and depend on Princeton dropping a contest. The hope for the program’s 12th Ivy title soon vanished, as the Crimson fell to the Tigers, 68-59, in the penultimate game of the season. The fourth loss meant that Harvard would share second place with the Bulldogs, a team that had finished in second-to-last place only two campaigns ago.
“I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t an extremely disappointing loss, especially to lose to Yale twice,” Matera said.
The Crimson closed out the season with a 62-55 victory over historic rival Dartmouth, which has traded places with Yale in women’s basketball over the years. The Big Green, winner of the Ivy title only two years ago, finished tied for last place this season.
Despite the unmet expectations, Harvard enjoyed the continued development of its roster and the emergence of a new scorer in rookie Christine Clark. The freshman started all 28 games of the season and finished as the fourth highest scorer on the team averaging 12.1 points.
Lippert, second on the team in scoring last year, averaged 13.5 points as the team’s designated sixth man, coming off the bench to supply the Crimson with a scoring punch.
Coming off a promising season in which she learned to direct the Crimson offense, junior point guard Brogan Berry became the team’s leading scorer, averaging 13.9 points. Though her assists total decreased from the year before, the junior improved her rebounding and decreased her number of turnovers. Berry and junior guard Lindsay Louie were named co-captains for the 2011-2012 campaign, succeeding Matera and Jackie Alemany as leaders of the squad.
“I’m confident that Lindsay and Brogan will do a great job of leading the team as captains,” Matera said. “I’ve seen them working out this spring, and they’ve been doing a great job. The team is going to improve on what we did this past season and do bigger and better things.”
In addition to Matera and Alemany, the team will also lose senior Claire Wheeler, who did not play in her final season due to injury, and Emma Markley. Markley, a permanent fixture in the starting lineup for her all-around play and inside presence, averaged 12.7 points in the final campaign of a noteworthy Crimson career. The senior was a first-team All-Ivy selection last year after leading Harvard in scoring, rebounding, and blocking.
The class of 2011 will be the first class to leave the team in two years, as there were no seniors on the roster the previous season.
“They have made such a huge impact on this program, so they will definitely be missed,” Lippert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season marked by so many firsts for Harvard men’s basketball, one number stands out.
With 2.8 seconds left in a one-game playoff against Princeton in New Haven, the Tigers inbounded and hit a buzzer-beater to keep the Crimson out of its first NCAA Tournament since 1946.
But despite the loss, Harvard put together the its greatest season in the history of the program. For the first time ever, the Crimson won a share of the Ivy League title.
“I know [the Ivy League title] was a shared title with Princeton, but it was a big part of history,” said junior co-captain and forward Keith Wright.
The team earned its first-ever NIT appearance and broke school records for wins, both overall and in the Ancient Eight.
Wright won the team’s second-ever Ivy League MVP, the program’s first since 1984.
In the last few weeks of the season, almost every game was called the most important in program history. And sure enough, each was surpassed by the game after.
The squad opened the season on Nov. 13 with a loss to George Mason on the road. After the loss to the Patriots, the team won its next five in pre-Ivy play, including two easy victories over Colorado and Fordham of the Big 12 and the Atlantic 10, respectively.
Three days after the win over the Rams, the team travelled to Ann Arbor to face Michigan, where Tommy Amaker coached before taking the helm at Harvard. The Crimson held a seven-point lead at the half but couldn’t hold on, losing to its second major-conference opponent of the year, 65-62.
On Dec. 22, the team played its toughest game of the year against UConn, at the time undefeated and ranked fourth in the nation. Harvard fell far behind early and never caught up against the eventual national champions, losing its most lopsided game of the year, 81-52.
But after the loss to another big-conference opponent, the Crimson made its move.
Following a pair of wins over Monmouth and MIT, Harvard once again beat Boston College, the third consecutive year that the team has taken down the Eagles on the road.
Three days later, the Ivy League season began. The Crimson beat Dartmouth on the road on Jan. 8, 68-53, before beating the Big Green at home two weeks later. After two more easy wins against Columbia and Cornell, Harvard was 4-0 in Ivy play going into the toughest road trip of the season.
“[This season] was a really cool experience,” said junior co-captain and guard Oliver McNally. “We were a young team, but we had a pretty good shot at winning the league.”
Each undefeated going into the Feb. 4 matchup, it was clear that the Crimson and the Tigers were the class of the Ancient Eight. And as Harvard would do in all three of its games against Princeton, the team took a halftime lead.
But the Crimson could not hold on, falling, 65-61. To maintain a decent chance at the Ivy title, Harvard had to beat Penn the next night.
It took a double-overtime game, but Harvard did just that. A block from sophomore Kyle Casey as time expired gave the Crimson a thrilling 83-82 win to stay alive.
After the weekend split, the rest of the year looked like a countdown to the Harvard-Princeton rematch in the final regular-season contest at Lavietes. But the other Ivies made that road a little more turbulent for both the Crimson and the Tigers.
Brown played spoiler. The Bears handed Princeton their first league loss of the year and would have done the same to Harvard had the Crimson not put together one of the biggest second-half comebacks in NCAA history.
But just as it looked like Harvard’s season finale would be a winner-take-all for the Ivy League title, the Crimson could not hold on. A 70-69 loss to Yale on the road meant that even with a win against the Tigers in the final weekend of the year, Princeton could still force a one-game playoff.
Harvard won its last two games to take a share of the crown, but with a win over Penn in the Ivy League’s last regular-season game, the Tigers forced an extra game. And with 2.8 seconds left, Douglas Davis handled the inbound, pump-faked, and hit a mid-range jumper to send Princeton to the Dance.
The Crimson had a shot at an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament but was instead a six-seed in the NIT. Harvard lost to Oklahoma State on the road, 71-54, in the first-ever matchup between the two schools to bring an end to the best season in program history.
“Number one, when coach [Tommy] Amaker was recruiting all of us—why we all came here—was that we wanted to make history,” freshman Matt Brown said. “We got the school and the community really involved, and we appreciate all the support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s volleyball team began the season with a string of victories and earned retribution for some of last year’s losses, the Crimson (9-13, 1-7 EIVA Hay) struggled in league play in the latter stretch of its season, earning its only league victory against NJIT in the last game of the season.
The Crimson came flying out of the gates, starting the season winning six of its first seven games.
“We started off with a better start than we’ve had in recent years,” said junior co-captain Matt Jones. “Then we had a weaker part in our schedule. Our goal was to do well in the league, but we were never really able to establish a rhythm there.”
After the initial success, the young Harvard team went through a rough stretch, losing 12 out of its final 15 games.
“We were in a unique situation,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said.  “Half of [the players on] our team were freshman, and we just had one senior—it’s pretty rare when that happens.”
The team relied on rookies Will Chambers, Chris Gibbons, Nick Madden, Michael Owen, and Kyle Rehkemper throughout the season.
“[Having a young team] definitely posed its challenges. It always takes some time to get freshmen up and ready to go.” Baise said. “I can’t say enough about this freshman class. They were willing to do anything they had to do learn what Harvard volleyball was about.”
“The freshman did a great job for us,” Jones echoed. “Obviously we would have loved to have gotten more wins as a team, but I think individually we did some great things.”
Despite the losses in the latter part of the season, there remained some bright spots for Harvard.
“Our captains were great this year. They built great team chemistry.” Baise said. “They kept our team focused and were leaders on and off the court.”
Through the tough stretch in the season, the Crimson relied upon Jones for his leadership and kills, especially.
“He was our go-to guy,” sophomore Derek Jansma said. “When we needed a point or a kill, he was there. He played a phenomenal season.”
When the team was successful, they touted great service and defense.
“When those were on, we were pretty tough to beat,” Baise said. “A lot hinged on receiving other team’s serves.”
The team recorded several key victories, including two wins against the other varsity volleyball program in the Ivy League, Princeton. And when the team didn’t emerge victorious, Baise found aspects of his team’s play to be proud of.
“We returned to California for the first time in 10 years and played great games,” he said. “We were up and competitive in other games that we should have had.”
“The season highlight was definitely taking a set from USC, who at the time was No. 1 in the nation,” Jansma added.
Harvard’s season ended on a high note, as the Crimson took down a league rival, NJIT, in its last stance at home.
“The last game of the season—getting that one league victory—was huge,” Jones said.
“It felt fantastic,” Jansma added. “Not many teams can say they ended their season on a victory. It’s great to go into the offseason and next year on a positive note.”
The Crimson will graduate just one senior, Shaun Mansour, and will have the same core group of players to build upon next year.
“Of course we want to improve our record, but more specifically, we want to be a little bit tougher,” Jones said. “Not only tough on every rep, but starting today through next year to go as hard as we can and stay as focused as we can.”
“Our first goal for next year is figuring out how to compete,” Baise said. “I think we are going to see a lot of the struggles of this year pay off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was Harvard.
And then there was everyone else.
In the EARC this year, there simply wasn’t another school that compared.
Both the No. 1 Crimson lightweight crew and No. 3 heavyweights dominated their regional competition from start to finish en route to a trip to Worcester, Mass., for Eastern Sprints.
Once there, the Crimson earned both the Rowe Cup—which recognizes the best heavyweight team finish—and the Jope Cup—which recognizes the best lightweight team finish—to go with wins by both 1Vs, both 2Vs, and the heavyweight 4V and 1F.
“I thought it was a terrific performance,” said Harvard heavyweight coach Harry Parker. “It’s not often a program has all of its crews row right up to their potential.”
For the lightweights, the key moment in the season came when the 1V used a dominant third 500 meters to move past Princeton and Yale and earn the title of the nation’s fastest crew.
The heavyweights’ tightest race might have been even more impressive. With 300 meters to go, the Crimson 1V was down two to three seats to a Tigers crew that wouldn’t go away.
But Harvard’s sprint gave it a 1.2 second lead that preserved what was then a team-wide undefeated streak.
That in-race resilience was the product of unprecedented depth on both squads. Athletes in both the 1V and the 2V had to fight for their seats all season, and the 1V and 2V shared the limelight all season.
“There are some really talented rowers in the 2V who most other years would be in the 1V,” said senior Jared Dourdeville, two seat of the lightweight first varsity eight. “And that really showed on Sunday [in the Grand Finals at Sprints] when the 2V started at a 48 and basically just dominated the race from the first 500.”
The heavyweights also have several 2V athletes strong enough for almost any other 1V in the country, which explains why lineups changed just before the heavyweights’ race against Northeastern.
“I think it stems from having three or four good [freshman] classes in succession, which is unusual,” Parker said. “One of the contributing factors is the fellows have stayed with the program whether they’ve been in the first crew or the second or the third.”
Combine the Crimson’s depth with its impressive erg scores and seemingly flawless technique and Harvard had a recipe for success.
The Sprints showing came on the heels of a regular season in which every Crimson eight went undefeated and the lightweight 1V and 2V both earned the right to call themselves the nation’s best.
The season is far from over as a trip to Red Top for the Harvard-Yale Regatta awaits the heavyweights, and IRAs is still on the horizon for both squads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All of a sudden, everything was black.
Chris Harvard lay on the rubber mat, unable to remember where he was and what he was doing.
Bubba had moved too fast, his kick had been about six inches closer than it should have been. And now, he was enveloped in pure darkness.
It is one of the few concussions former wrestler Chris Nowinski ’00 can even somewhat remember.
“I have memory of it partially,” the former wrestler says. “I don’t know what’s memory and what’s been recreated. It was amazingly not traumatic because no one [in the crowd] realized what really happened.”
But Nowinski knew the feeling. He had experienced it five times before.
Nowinski’s time at Harvard and later his time spent as a professional wrestler would help shape what is now his life’s passion: ending America’s concussion crisis. As research increasingly shows that brain trauma has significant neurological implications—and can even induce severe depression—Nowinski has helped the public and professional athletes understand the serious risks posed by damaging blows to the head.
AN UNDERGRADUATE ATHLETE
The concussions began in college, back when Nowinski was a member of “The Polish Connection,” along with roommate Isaiah Kacyvenski ’00.
As best friends who share a Polish background, the pair anchored the heart of Harvard football’s defense for four years, including its 1997 Ivy League championship team.
“We ended up spending time as roommates,” Kacyvenski says. “I was the middle linebacker, and he was your nose tackle, so it worked...a lot of stuff we did we played off each other.”
Nowinski was a three-year letterman for the Crimson, achieving honorable mention All-Ivy distinction after his junior year and second team All-Ivy status following his senior season.
“He came to Harvard as a very good athlete,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “Eventually, he became an outstanding player...he was one of the key kids on our ’97 championship team, just a kid you could always count on, a kid that was very dependable who was a great teammate to all the guys on the team.”
It was during his collegiate career that Nowinski received his first two concussions, but like many football players at the time, he did not report them to the coaching staff out of a lack of understanding of their severity and a desire not to appear weak. Instead, he chose to live with what he calls a “suck-it-up mentality,” one that still exists in college football today.
“With any injury, there’s a feeling of frustration that you can’t be out there with your teammates,” explains Harvard senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, who has suffered multiple concussions in the past.
“There’s definitely pressure to come back. There’s the expectation that if you seem like you can play, you should do everything you can.”
BEFORE THE CAUSE, IN SEARCH OF A CAREER
During their college days, Nowinski and Kacyvenski shared many things—shaved heads, a propensity for stopping the run, and even a bunk bed (despite their combined weight of 550 pounds)—as part of what Nowinski called their “symbiotic relationship.” The summer before their senior season, the Polish Connection lived together in DeWolfe House, during which time Nowinski cooked and worked as a finance consultant from eight-to-five and trained with his teammate for the NFL at night.
“He was in the top bunk, I was on the bottom,” Kacyvenski says. “He would snore unbelievably loudly, because he was 50 pounds overweight. I developed an ability to throw pillows and shoes at him. Anything to get him to stop, even really loud clapping.”
After Kacyvenski finished his career as the Crimson’s all-time leader in tackles, the linebacker seemed destined for the next level, and was drafted in the fourth round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks.
But two shoulder surgeries after his senior season meant the other half of the Connection was not destined to continue his football career.
After graduating cum laude with a degree in sociology, Nowinski moved on from football, beginning his first job as a consultant at Trinity Partners, a life sciences consulting firm in Waltham, Mass., that gave him his first experiences with the medical world.
There, he was paid well, but began to become uncomfortable with the long hours he needed to work and with the life he had begun to lead. He realized then that he was not a 40-hour-a-week guy.
His way out was just down the hall.
Nowinski’s boss, John Corker ’79, was, like Nowinski, an avid wrestling fan, and the two would often converse about the sport as an escape from work.
“We both expressed our somewhat hidden enjoyment of professional wrestling,” Nowinski says. “John had friends in the business and thought that I could make a career out of it.”
As a natural athlete, Nowinski decided to take the suggestion and run with it.
“[John] put the idea in my head that the consulting job would be there forever, but the window to be a professional wrestler was short,” Nowinski says. “He kind of gave me a license to go over to Killer Kowalski’s Pro Wrestling School and let me head out early to train.”
The former football player spent four nights a week honing his skills, turning in 14-hour days on a regular basis. After Nowinski spent a few months at the Allston facility, Corker—who had a few friends in the television industry—helped his consultant obtain a preliminary tryout with the WCW, the wrestling organization owned by Turner Broadcasting.
Nowinski then took matters into his own hands, submitting an application tape to the MTV reality show “Tough Enough.” His video was accepted, and though initially hesitant, Nowinski decided he would take the gig.
There was only one problem—there was already another Chris N. on the show.
Nowinski, then, needed a new name, and he didn’t have a choice in its selection.
Chris Harvard.
“I was tagged with the moniker that followed me for years,” Nowinski says. “It was an interesting gimmick, which of course cemented my future as a bad guy.... There’s not a lot of sympathy for Harvard grads in the real world.”
After participating in the show for nine weeks—which required nine-to-five days of physical activity—Nowinski won runner-up.
“He really wanted to play in the NFL and didn’t get a shot, and I think he still wanted to be in that arena,” Kacyvenski says. “I remember him undertaking it and I was like, ‘yeah okay.’ I wasn’t sure if he would be tough enough ... but he made it work.”
‘CLEAR THE COBWEBS’
Nowinski continued to train and improve after the show and was eventually offered a contract with the WWE. On June 10, 2002, the wrestler made his professional debut on “Monday Night Raw.” Over the next year, his character would deprecate the other “less intelligent” wrestlers, drawing the vitriol of the WWE fanbase.
Of course, in professional wrestling, Chris Harvard was merely putting on an act.
“The gravity is the most real part,” Nowinski laughs. “And a few moves. Everything else is staged.”
Much of the character that Nowinski created came from his experiences at Harvard, and the wrestler often wrote much of his own material. His favorite move was “The Harvard Buster,” which was topped with an “honor role,” in which Nowinski would flip his opponents on their backs and pin them by their shoulders.
“His ability to speak to people came across wonderfully well when he was doing his vignettes,” Kacyvenski says. “The creative freedom was perfect for him. And it’s similar to football in that it’s a very macho culture.”
Chris Harvard is recognized as the youngest Hardcore Champion in WWE history, which he won with a 2002 defeat of a wrestler named Crash Holly.
But the character would also often lose, and the threat of injury was real.
In June 2003, Nowinski was wrestling 300-pound Bubba Ray Dudley in Hartford, Conn., when—after taking a hit to his chin from Bubba’s boot—Nowinski quickly began to lose his vision. Bubba made his move and went for the pin, but Nowinski couldn’t remember what he was supposed to do next. He realized that something was terribly wrong.
“That was one of the first times where I blacked out and forgot where I was and what we were doing,” Nowinski says. “I just went backstage and hid and tried to clear the cobwebs.”
The next day, his headache had almost faded, and Chris Harvard told his doctor that he felt fine. He was back in the ring an hour later.
But he had spoken too soon. Just as Bubba connected with a forearm to the back, Nowinski’s vision began to grow fuzzy again. The blood was pounding so strongly that he became afraid his head would explode. After the match, the headache was much worse, but the pain went away after an hour, and Nowinski figured he’d give it another go the next night.
He performed as such for three more weeks, but soon realized that the concussion had left his brain in terrible shape. He was suffering from severe migraines and even depression.
“I didn’t understand why I had headaches everyday, and why my short term memory had disappeared,” Nowinski says. “My parents were always worried about me. I became very tough to be around, so my friends were supportive at first and then I think I became a drain on them. It wasn’t until I went to my eighth doctor that I started understanding that what was happening could be explained by biologically.”
“For a solid year he was not himself,” Kacyvenski adds. “He’s usually unbelievably charismatic, but he was a different person. He could not function at a high level both emotionally and mentally.”
A NEW BEGINNING
After taking an extended absence from wrestling, Nowinski decided he needed to officially retire from the WWE in 2004. He then started to investigate what was wrong with his brain, and to research the dangers of concussions and the long-term brain trauma they could lead to.
After talking to former teammates and friends, he discovered that information about the hazards of brain injury had never truly reached the sports world, and that people were dying because of it.
Something had to be done.
“Once my eyes were opened to how easy the fix was to save so many lives, I felt obligated to try and change it myself,” Nowinski says.
He began to try to spread the word about the dangers of concussions, but says he faced a world that was often skeptical about the dangers posed by sports-induced head injuries.
“So many people wanted him to stop,” Kacyvenski says. “So many powers that be wanted to push him out and squash him, but he would say ‘no.’”
HEAD GAMES
Shortly thereafter, Nowinski met doctor number eight—Robert Cantu, the Chairman of the Department of Surgery, Chief of Neurosurgery, and Director of Sports Medicine at Emerson Hospital in Boston.
After diagnosing Nowinski with post-concussion syndrome, Cantu explained that concussions were a serious biological problem and helped Nowinski realize that he needed to reframe the discussion in order for the sports world to better understand the repercussions of head injuries.
“When I started intensively researching the issue, I realized that the research that told us that we should change sports was out there, but wasn’t in an easily digestible structure,” Nowinski says. “I figured that putting it together into a persuasive argument was step one ... I didn’t know what steps would follow but I knew the research needed to be compiled in a way that people could sit down with it for a couple hours and walk away understanding it.”
Nowinski decided to put his ideas in writing. By the summer of 2005, his 200-page manuscript, “Head Games: Football’s Concussion Crisis from the NFL to Youth Leagues,” was finished.
With the help of Alan Schwarz, at the time a freelance sportswriter writer for the New York Times, he got in touch with publishers.
“I thought his manuscript was great,” says Schwarz, who had written one book on baseball statistics and was working on another.
Nowinski’s book—in which he called out the NFL for its “tobacco-industry-like refusal to acknowledge the depths of the problem”—was published to positive reviews in October 2006. A month later, its research was tragically validated, when former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters committed suicide in his Tampa Bay home.
Nowinski read about the death, and realized that something was strange—Waters was known to be one of the hardest-hitting players in the league during his playing days, but was also widely considered to be a gregarious, happy individual.  His decision to kill himself was a mystery Nowinski wanted to solve, and a brief Internet search led Nowinski to discover that Waters had once told a reporter that he had suffered at least 15 concussions during his playing days.  Nowinski decided to initiate an inquiry into Waters’ suicide.
He received permission from the player’s family to have Waters’ brain tissue examined, and sent samples of the tissue to neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu at the University of Pittsburgh. Nowinski wanted them checked for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the tangled threads of irregular proteins that cause degenerative disease and have been linked to cognitive and intellectual dysfunction, including depression.
Omalu’s findings confirmed Nowinski’s predictions. Waters had suffered from depression caused by sustained brain damage that he had accumulated while playing football. Omalu found that Waters’ brain was comparable to that of an 85-year-old man suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.
Shortly after, Schwarz heard from Nowinski, who was then still working in Boston as a pharmaceutical consultant.
“He called me and said ‘Alan, I think I have something pretty big here, and you’re the only one who ever took me seriously,’” Schwarz says. “And so he told me about the Andre Waters story.”
Schwarz jumped at the lead, and an article that linked Waters’ depression to head injury—still a novel idea at the time—was published in The Times in January 2007. A month later, HBO Real Sports reached out to Nowinski, asking him to participate in three separate features that told the story of the concussion crisis.
“It was amazing how many leaders in the sports world watched that show,” Nowinski says.
Knowledge was beginning to spread about the detrimental impact that brain injury could have. In the spring of that year, Nowinski received a call from Julian Bailes, the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at West Virginia University and a former Pittsburgh Steelers neurosurgeon, who explained that there were similarities between the Waters case and the death of former Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, who had killed himself by driving 90 miles per hour against the flow of traffic to evade police.
An autopsy revealed that Strzelczyk had not been intoxicated—as was initially believed—but was rather suffering from brain damage that had led him to act in a manner many assumed was bipolar. Nowinski contacted Omalu about conducting a post-mortem examination of Strzelcyk’s brain, in which Omalu again found signs of CTE.
As word of these discoveries began to spread, Nowinski began to collaborate with former New England Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson, who prematurely retired from the NFL in 2005 because of concussion symptoms that would later cause him to suffer from depression and headaches and show early signs of Alzheimer’s. Johnson placed part of the blame on Patriots coach Bill Belichick for pressuring him to participate in full contact drills three days after suffering a concussion.
Nowinski also investigated the case of former wrestler Chris Benoit, who killed his wife, seven-year-old son, and himself after suffering from depression in 2007. Nowinski contacted Benoit’s father, suggesting that years of brain trauma may have led to his son’s actions. Nowinski sent the brain to Bailes, who found it to have an advanced form of dementia caused by CTE that had brought about the behavioral problems.
FINDING A SOLUTION
These types of cases led Nowinski to realize that the problem was bigger than even he had imagined. He came to believe that a organization dedicated to the cause was needed, one that could focus solely on the concussions problem.
He approached his former doctor about forming an institute that would advance the study of the effects of brain trauma in athletes.
Cantu agreed, and the Sports Legacy Institute was founded in June 2007 to work toward a solution to the concussion crisis in sports “through medical research, treatment, and education & prevention.”
“[I knew] the research was the key to changing this,” Nowinski says. “So SLI was conceived to facilitate the research and turn it into policy and education to protect kids.”
Upon starting SLI, Nowinski and Cantu also wanted to find a home for that research at a top-tier medical school.
After seeing a presentation by Dr. Robert Stern—director of the Alzheimer’s Program at Boston University—that linked brain trauma to Alzheimer’s, Nowinski reached out to Stern about starting the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE), which opened at BU in 2008. As co-director, Nowinski is primarily responsible for obtaining brain donations from the families of former football players whose lives were affected by post-concussion syndrome.
And when Nowinski decided he wanted to begin collecting brains, he knew he could turn to his other half first.
Part two of the Polish Connection—having witnessed firsthand the impact concussions had had on Nowinski—readily agreed.
“It was a no-brainer,” Kacyvenski says. “Pun intended, by the way.”
According to the organization’s website, the mission of the CSTE is “to conduct state-of-the-art research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy through the study of its neuropathology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, disease course, genetic and environmental risk factors, and ways to prevent this progressive dementia.”
“Working with the families of brain donors is very rewarding,” Nowinski says. “[So is] getting buy-ins from youth coaches, and hearing the success stories of coaches who virtually eliminate hitting from practice, as we recommend.”
As co-founder and president of the Sports Legacy Institute, Nowinski is also responsible for development, fundraising, and designing educational programs. He often travels to give presentations to schools and organizations about “conquering concussions.”
“We want to tell coaches that the brain is far more fragile than we [ever] knew,” Nowinski says. “Every hit to the head counts ... players need to understand that there are serious long-term ramifications to abusing your brain, and that there’s no such thing as a ‘tough’ brain. They need to be more careful at what they do and need to become comfortable with not only sitting out with a concussion but also not using their head as a weapon.”
Nowinski says that as awareness has spread, it’s gotten easier to encourage families of deceased players, as well as current athletes, to promise to donate their brains for research.
After Kacyvenski, four NFL players, including three former pro-bowlers—Ravens center Matt Birk ’98, Seahawks linebacker Lofa Tatupu, and Cardinals receiver Sean Morey—pledged in 2009 to donate their brains and spinal cord tissue to the CSTE upon death, so that researchers could learn more about the effects of trauma on those organs.
“There’s less convincing now because people have heard of the work,” Nowinski says. “In our first two years at BU, 20 brains were donated, and last year [we received] 50 brains.”
But despite the success, there’s a difficult part to Nowinski’s job as well.
“You’re calling the family of a famous athlete who had just died in a horrible way,” Nowinski explains. “That first call to families is something that I still will never be comfortable with ... but people understand and want to see something good come out of a tragedy.”
In the past few years, thanks in large part to Nowinski’s research, both the public and athletes have become more aware of the dangers posed by concussions.
In 2009, the NFL instituted new rules changes that enforced stricter restrictions on allowing players to return to games or practices after head injuries. Now, any player who shows certain signs or symptoms of head injury—dizziness, headaches, and memory gaps—is not allowed to return on the same day.
“There’s independent doctors on sidelines now for the players,” Kacyvenski says. “You have medical coverage that says this player is hurt with a serious concussion, and doesn’t put manhood in question ... there’s a better protocol in place for diagnosing concussions. People understand better. You can’t just kind of play it off anymore. Awareness has skyrocketed.”
The new rules have made strides towards solving what remains a major problem. Nearly a fifth of NFL players surveyed by The Associated Press in November 2009 replied that they had hidden or played down the effects of a concussion.
“The people that make it [to the NFL] are wired to ignore the pain, over and over again,” Kacyvenski says. “You can’t treat a concussion like a broken arm and leg. It’s very difficult to prove...Chris has made this not a football issue; it’s now a public health issue. That’s a key distinction…[his impact] really is kind of amazing.”
In 2010, the NFL expanded its rules to prevent defenseless players from taking shots above their shoulders, with significant fines for any player who makes head-to-head contact with an opponent. Even more stringent return-to-play guidelines were instituted for players who had suffered concussions, and each team was required to consult with an independent neurologist in every case of a head injury.
Murphy, who has coached college football for 24 years and is currently Vice President of the American Football Coaches Association, could not be more impressed with the impact his former player is having.
“I follow his work very, very closely, and first and foremost I’m very proud of Chris,” Murphy says. “I don’t think there’s anyone else in the country who’s helped advance the knowledge of athletic head trauma as much as he has. I think a lot of what you’re seeing in changes in rules in protocol dealing with head trauma is a result of the work that he’s done.”
CHRIS HARVARD’ S IMPACT
Nowinski is now a prominent voice on an issue that is increasing in public awareness every day. Considered an expert in the field of concussion-related research, his work was featured on ESPN’s Outside the Lines in September 2007 and CBS’ 60 Minutes in October 2009. Sports Illustrated’s Pablo Torre ’05, a former Crimson editor, nominated him for Sportsman of the Year in 2010. Next year’s version of the popular Madden football video game will feature concussions for the first time.
“From 2006 to now the culture of the game is so much different and a lot of that can be attributed to Chris,” Kacyvenski says. “He has been the driving force—this thing could have died. It’s not like he’s got a huge head; he doesn’t care about [success]. He just wants to ensure safety, to ensure the pathway to research that’s not biased without any agendas.”
Nowinski’s work also influenced Schwarz to pursue the topic, and the journalist has since written over 200 articles on the concussions problem.
“There’s no person more singularly responsible for raising public awareness of concussions than Chris Nowinski,” Schwarz says. “I am given a lot of credit for being that person, but I wouldn’t have had anything to write about had Chris not educated me for the first year or so.”
In 2010, CSTE’s research discovered the first pathological link between head trauma and such neurological diseases as ALS.
But the tragic deaths that seem to be linked to repeated concussions have continued.
In April 2010, after Penn football captain Owen Thomas committed suicide, examination of his brain revealed that CTE had led to Thomas’ depression. Ten months later, former Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson took his own life by shooting himself in the chest, leaving a note requesting his brain be given to the NFL’s Brain Bank at BU to be examined for the same type of damage found in other decreased NFL players. The brain was sent to the CSTE, where Duerson’s self-hypothesis was confirmed. He too had suffered from CTE.
To Nowinski, these sad cases show that young athletes still need to be educated about the dangers associated with head trauma.
“We want to provide people with information and inspiration to play sports more safely,” he says. “[Our presentations] revolve around stories of mistakes that we’ve made, showing the brains of athletes who have taken their own lives, and helping people understand that they have a moral obligation to protect kids because kids aren’t old enough to accept the risks that we expose them to.”
Presently, more than 300 athletes, including 100 current and former NFL players, are on the CSTE’s brain donation registry, with 65 cases currently being studied.
“Chris has been very instrumental in bringing awareness to the potentially serious ramifications of concussions in sports,” NFL spokesperson Greg Aiello wrote in an email. “He has been a leader on this issue, and we have worked with him and supported his Boston University research group. Chris is a great example of someone making a positive difference for millions of young athletes and their parents.”
Knowledge about brain injury is starting to spread to other sports as well. On May 13, 2011, after suffering a concussion that caused him to miss half this season, New York Rangers left wing Derek Boogaard was found dead in his apartment at the age of 28. Boogaard’s family agreed to have his brain donated to the CSTE at BU, where it is presently being examined for CTE. The CSTE had previously found the disease in the brain of former Chicago Blackhawks enforcer Bob Probert, who died in July 2010.
Because of those types of cases, Nowinski’s long-term goal is to develop a diagnostic test for CTE while players are still living, and then to find a cure and treatment.
Kacyvenski has faith that his friend can accomplish this and much more.
“Chris has a brilliant mind,” he says. “He’s unbelievably intellectual, able to command a room and able to say what he has to say in a manner that’s pleasing to all sides. He believes that he can change the world. There weren’t many people who saw his vision, or a huge amount of people that understood. But he stayed on it, and it’s impressive to see him every step of the way. Moral of the story about Chris Nowinski: don’t bet against him, ever.”
Nowinski has a simpler message he’s trying to share.
“You only get one brain your entire life,” he says. “There’s no medal at the end for abusing it the most.”
From the top bunk in Dewolfe, Chris Harvard has certainly come a long way.
And it all began with a kick from Bubba.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No one celebrated early.
When the Harvard lightweights opened their season with a romp over Delaware, and the Crimson heavyweights followed suit a week later with a 18-second win over Cornell—last year’s IRA bronze medalists—in the first varsity eight race, there were no cries of “Next Stop: Sprints!”
Instead, Harvard took each race, each practice one step at a time. And it didn’t miss a single one.
Both crews knocked off top-10 squads in their second week of racing, with the Crimson heavyweights sweeping No. 7 Brown and the lightweights earning impressive victories in the 1V, 2V, and 3V over No. 10 Penn and No. 5 Georgetown.
The win over the Bears was especially gratifying as Brown handed the Harvard heavyweight 1V its only dual last season.
The next race was the hardest for the Crimson heavyweight 1V, just as the rankings suggested it would be. Princeton was ranked just below No. 3 Harvard at fourth in the country. The Tigers gave the Crimson 1V its toughest race of the season, and Harvard needed a powerful sprint in the last 300 meters to earn the victory.
The rest of the races were more lopsided, especially the 3V race, in which the Crimson 4V was able to beat Princeton’s 3V. On the Charles, the lightweights took care of Dartmouth and MIT while racing in nearly unrowable conditions.
Next on the menu for both the heavyweights and the lightweights was Navy. Both Midshipmen programs put up a strong fight.
The Navy heavyweights had a seven-seat lead on the Crimson 1V at one point during the race and the lightweight 1V was only able to eke out a 1.2 second win. In both cases, Harvard was able to do enough to preserve its undefeated record.
The next weekend was the lightweights’ definitive race of the regular season. Ranked second in the country at the time, the Crimson’s ruthless third 500 meters proved too much for both the then-No. 1 Tigers and No. 4 Yale to handle.
Harvard secured the prized Vogel Cup when the 2V boat also won its race. The heavyweights, by contrast, had an easier time—at least in the 1V race—as the Crimson 1V won by nearly 15 seconds. Harvard’s 1.4 second win in the 1F race preserved the Crimson’s undefeated streak in eights.
Harvard’s success across the board in both weight classes meant that the pressure and expectations were as high at Sprints. But pressure turns coal into diamonds, and it turned Newell Boathouse into Trophy Town. Both of the Crimson’s 1Vs and 2Vs capped off undefeated seasons with Sprints titles, as did the Harvard heavyweight 4V and 1F. Both teams also captured the team titles: the Rowe Cup for the heavyweights and the Jope Cup for the lightweights.
The lightweight 1V won its race with a strong second 1000 while the heavyweights took a lead meters early in the piece.
“I think it was really a textbook performance,” said junior Austin Meyer, seven seat of the lightweight 1V. “We had a good start. We were with everyone. The goal was not to get too far back. Our coxswain [junior] Angela [Chang] did an absolutely amazing job...We had a very strong second half of the race. The last 500 was just about finishing the job and making sure no one else got in front of us.”
“We took a length in the first 750,” said junior six seat Nick Jordan said of the heavyweight 1V race. “[Wisconsin] went with us...but they died, and then we just kept going.”
For both teams, the 2V race was at least as impressive, if not more so, and the heavyweight 1F’s win gave the Crimson a sweep of the top three heavyweight races.
“Those guys have pushed us, have been working extremely hard,” Meyer said of the lightweight 2V. “Their strokeman ‘Flo’ [sophomore Florian Mayr] sets a really nice strong base...They significantly controlled the body of that [Grand Final] race.”
“The 2V and the freshmen were awesome: great to see them dominate,” Jordan said of the heavyweights.
And still, no one stop to celebrate—the boats move ever forward, to the heavyweights’ storied race with Yale and to IRAs, where both boats look to avenge disappointing 2010 finishes.
Only time will tell if Harvard’s top boats on both teams are stoppable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting the year on a two-game winning streak, Harvard field hockey won only one of its next 15 contests, finishing the year 3-14 overall and 1-6 in the Ivy League.
This is the sixth consecutive season that the Crimson has failed to win at least half of its games, a streak dating back to a 12-5 campaign in 2004.
“Obviously the season didn’t go as well as we would have liked,” junior co-captain Carly Dickson said. “We had a lot of injuries and had to deal with a small team for most of the year.”
But there were a few bright spots in the 2010-2011 year for Harvard field hockey. Dickson was named to the All-Ivy second team – her third All-Ivy recognition in as many years. The junior played a key role in the Crimson attack, leading the team in shots (38) and finishing third in total points (nine).
Sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos also earned the second-team accolade after a solid year in goal. The sophomore stopped 72.5 percent of shots that came her way, the third-highest mark in the Ancient Eight. She was a constant presence for Harvard between the pipes, playing every minute of every game.
And junior Georgia McGillivray received an All-Ivy honorable mention as well. McGillivray will also be joining Dickson as co-captain next season after the departure of graduating co-captain KJ Warren.
“In spite of some of the struggles on the field, it was really a great four years,” senior Chloe Keating said. “The group of girls in my class is awesome; I’m going to miss them.”
The season started in dominant fashion with the Crimson beating Holy Cross and Bryant, 6-1 and 5-2 respectively, in a homestand during the first weekend of September. But things quickly took a turn for the worse after a road trip to Vermont and New Hampshire resulted in three losses and only two Harvard goals. The lackluster Crimson offense would characterize much of the rest of the season. In addition to being shut out nine times, Harvard finished seventh in the Ivy League in shots, goals scored, and goal differential.
“Having such a small team limited the number of substitutions we could make and really put our fitness to the test,” Dickson said. “We proved that we were in good enough shape to play 60 minutes, but sometimes not having that extra burst limited our offensive opportunities.”
The highlight of the year came on Sept. 25 in an Ivy League game on the road at Penn. Dickson and McGillivray each scored once, and Tassopoulos got her first shutout of the season, giving the Crimson its only Ancient Eight victory.
“It’s always special to have an Ivy League win,” Dickson said. “Especially early in the season and on the road.”
It would turn out to be the last win of the season, sparking a nine-game losing streak to finish the year.
Despite the disappointment of the season on the whole, the future looks bright for Harvard. Not only is a talented freshman class coming to campus in the fall, but coach Sue Caples also implemented new training measures in the offseason.
“In the winter, when we’re usually confined to the weight room and conditioning because of the snow, we played indoor field hockey for the first time,” Dickson said. “It really helps our defending and first touch on the ball.”
The Crimson also instituted a new offensive system which yielded positive results in two unofficial spring tournaments with Boston-area teams. All of this contributes to a sense of optimism on the team that should translate into more positive results on the field next season, despite losing three seniors from an already undersized squad.
“It’s sad to see the seniors go, and we’re definitely going to miss them,” Dickson said. “But at the same time, we’re looking forward to integrating the new freshman class into the team and are constantly looking to improve. Our morale is high moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard coach Harry Parker’s excellence has been so consistent that it almost gets taken for granted. But this season, his success was impossible to ignore.
The Harvard heavyweight first varsity eight, second varsity eight, and freshman eight each won their respective events at EARC Sprints.
A second-place finish by the third varsity eight and a third-place finish by the freshman four rounded out the team’s extremely successful trip to Worcester, Mass., and helped the Crimson earn the Rowe Cup for the best team finish.
The Sprints success came on the heels of a regular season in which Harvard went undefeated in the 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, and 1F.
The success of Parker’s crews’ speaks for itself, but the coach himself refuses to take credit for it, attributing the success instead to his dedicated core of athletes.
“There aren’t any secrets,” he said. “The primary ingredient...is talented athletes. You [need to] have capable and motivated athletes who are willing to train hard in order to achieve their goals. I am willing to say: one of the foundations is [to work] very hard to teach really good, strong fundamental rowing technique...and the other is to help in creating an environment whereby the athletes train hard. Quite frankly, that motivation comes primarily from the athletes. My only contribution is to nurture that.”
According to freshman heavyweight coach Bill Manning, Parker’s humbleness in interviews typifies his athletes-first style of coaching.
“He’s concerned for the well being of the students on the team,” Manning said. “He’s trying to create success so that the students can enjoy the success, not so that he can add to his [coaching record]...[He has] an extraordinary understanding of the sport: the physiological...the mechanics, an understanding of the responsibilities and obligations of a student.”
While Parker himself may be humble about his accomplishments, his rowers are quick to sing his praises.
“He is an awesome coach,” said junior Nick Jordan, six seat of the first varsity eight. “He’s really done a great job with our crew...He really helps to give you confidence to get ready for a big race.”
“The thing about Harry is he’s just got so much experience,” added captain and varsity four seat Anthony Locke. “His leadership was so valuable. Sitting at the starting line, we felt as though we had the best possible preparation.”
That this year’s Rowe Cup—the team’s 31st—was no accident; Parker’s crews have long had a knack for big races.
“A big part of coaching is putting guys in challenging scenarios where they can be successful,” Manning said. “So when they get to the bigger stage, they have the confidence to handle the bigger stage of the big events.”
Jordan put it more simply:
“He just knows how to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past several years, the Harvard wrestling team has struggled, but a few of the squad’s standouts have salvaged the season by performing successfully on an individual basis. This season was no different.
The Crimson wrestling squad only saw two team victories for the year, compared to 15 losses overall, but three Harvard wrestlers managed to emerge from the season with winning dual records and finish the season on a high note.
The first of these Crimson standouts was sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman. When J.P. O’Connor ’10 won the NCAA National Championship last year at 157 pounds, questions emerged about which Harvard wrestlers would be able to rise to the challenge of carrying on his success.
Even though Peppelman fell short of the national title, his 2010-2011 performance gives the wrestling program reason for optimism for future seasons. In only his sophomore year, Peppelman battled to earn an eighth-place finish at the NCAA Wrestling Championships.
Over the course of the entire season, he racked up an impressive 33-9 record, giving him the seventh-most wins in a single season in Crimson wrestling history.
In dual competition, Peppelman was almost perfect, going 16-1. The sophomore also earned the distinction of becoming an All-American and being named first-team All-Ivy.
“He wasn’t even in the top-25 rankings at the beginning of the year and was able to place eighth at the NCAA tournament,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “That’s exciting, and it gives us a big momentum shift for next year.”
The team’s other co-captain, Andrew Knapp, was one of the few others on the team to also find success.
As the biggest wrestler on the team, in the 285-pound weight class, Knapp was always the last to wrestle, but his tight matches with opponents never failed to excite.
Knapp finished the season with a 10-10 record and an 8-7 record in the duals, but many of his losses against opponents were by only one or two points. His biggest win of the season came at the EIWA Championships, when he dominated Army’s Christian Botero, 14-0, to earn his first major decision of the year.
Although Knapp had many losses during his first three years on the squad, the senior capped off his career with his best season to date, falling just short of qualifying for the NCAA championships.
For sophomore Steven Keith, his successful freshman season could have been difficult to follow. But Keith did not fall into the sophomore slump that plagues many athletes, finishing off the year with a 23-17 record—more wins than his 20 last season—and holding a 10-7 record in the duals. Keith also finished fourth at the EIWA Championships, just one place shy of his third-place result last year.
Keith may be the smallest wrestler on the Crimson, but his statistics demonstrate that he is powerful on the mats. Keith earned 13 decisions and six major decisions, defeating his opponents by 10 or more points five times. Although Keith faced disappointment at the NCAA championships with one win and two losses, he still has two years to make a run for the title.
“I think I made some really big improvements,” Keith said. “Unfortunately, it didn’t show in the way I wanted it to at the end of the season. I would have liked to make a bit of a run at the NCAA tournament, but I did actually win a match this year at NCAAs, which was nice.”
For junior Corey Jantzen, the season started out successfully but came to an abrupt end in the middle. Jantzen won 12 of his first 17 contests, but his season ended when he learned over January break that he would need surgery after suffering a torn elbow ligament.
“When Corey Jantzen went down, it kind of hurt,” Weiss said. “He obviously had a good shot at playing for the NCAA tournament, so that was a big blow.”
The team may be young, but with Peppelman, Keith, and Jantzen still on the squad for at least another year, Harvard has a shot at more success, both individually and for the team, in 2011-2012.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like scotch and wisdom, the Harvard fencing team seems to have only improved with age.
Nearly two years ago, Crimson coach Peter Brand expressed concern with the lack of depth on both his men’s and women’s squads following the graduation of star fencers Emily Cross ’09, Kai Itameri-Kinter ’09, and Benji Ungar ’09.
In response, he redoubled his recruitment efforts, leading to a very young and very inexperienced team in the 2009-2010 season. In fact, 19 of the 29 fencers were either freshmen or sophomores.
But in spite the youth of the Harvard fencing team as a whole, its results over the past two years continue to serve as a testament to its strength and growth as a team.
The Crimson women’s squad opened the season with a bang at the Garret Penn State Invitational, earning two gold medals through the efforts of freshman Alexandra Kiefer and junior Caroline Vloka in the foil and sabre, respectively.
With the regular season in full motion, the Harvard women then strung together a six-match winning streak during which the Crimson took down the defending national champion Penn State in addition to Tufts, North Carolina, Sacred Heart, NYU, and Vassar.
The run came to an end at the St. John’s Super Cup. But even after the loss, the Crimson didn’t slow its early-season pace, sweeping the competition at the Eric Sollee Invitational, 3-0, against Hunter College, Duke and Penn. In its next tournament, Harvard finished third in the Ivy League conference event.
For junior co-captain Caroline Vloka, the ability of the women’s squad to maintain its dominant form throughout the season came from the team dynamic.
“I think it mostly came from our team’s chemistry with our new freshmen this year,” Vloka said. “They brought a lot of new energy and a spark that really inspired everyone on the team to bond and work together as a team throughout the season.”
The women concluded the Ivy League Championships with a 4-2 record, defeating Penn, Cornell, Brown, and Yale, but falling against Princeton and Columbia.
Leading the women’s squad in the Ivy League tournament were Vloka and Kiefer, who both earned first-team All-Ivy League honors for their performances in the saber and foil, respectively.
The team made the postseason after qualifying five fencers for the NCAA Regional. The squad put together a number of strong performances—none stronger than national champion Kiefer, who defeated Eve Levin of Princeton to take the collegiate title.
Junior Noam Mills reached the finals of the epee competition but fell to Notre Dame’s Courtney Huxley, placing second for the third year in a row.
For the men’s squad, the season was similarly marked with success. The team opened the year at the Garret Penn State Open with six top-10 finishes and two medals in three weapons. This depth would prove vital for the men, as Harvard staged an 11-2 run leading up to the Ivy League Championship.
“On the men’s side this past season, we had a very deep team,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “We don’t have the megastars that we find on the women’s side. But in terms of being able to win an Ivy League championship, I felt that our men were always in a better position to win the Ivy title because we had great fencers in all three positions.”
The team did just that, winning the Ivy League title after stringing together a 5-0 run in the tournament. The Crimson men captured the Ivy crown on the final bout of the tournament, when Crimson freshman and epee specialist Michael Raynis scored the tiebreaking point against Yale’s Peter Cohen to win, 14-13.
After capturing the Ivy title, the men’s squad concentrated its efforts on the NCAA Fencing Championships.
In the event, Raynis finished sixth in the epee, freshman Lucas Lin placed 14th in the foil, and sophomore Thomas Kolasa and junior captain Valentin Staller placed 14th and ninth in the saber, respectively.
In light of the growing experience and depth of both fencing squads, Brand said he is optimistic about next season’s team.
“Overall next year, I expect to have an excellent squad both on the men’s and women’s side,” Brand said. “We should continue to see the strong individual performances on the women’s side and new recruits on the men’s side should increase our depth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a frustrating 2009-2010 season, the 2010-2011 campaign looked to be a rebuilding year for the Radcliffe heavyweight crew team. But after ending the dual season with an 11-4 record, a fifth-place finish at the EAWRC Sprints, and a berth to the NCAA Championships, it was clear that the Black and White heavyweights not only exceeded expectations, but also returned to their former prestige.
“I think this season has gone pretty well for us overall,” co-captain Olivia Coffey said. “Based on last year’s results, I don’t think that many people expected us to do very well, but we’ve beaten two top-ten teams, and leading up to Sprints we were 12th in the nation.”
The lightweights looked to continue along the same trajectory this season after a relatively successful season last year.
Both the heavyweights and lightweights medaled to start their respective fall seasons—heavyweights with silver and lightweights with gold—at the Head of the Housatonic Regatta. At the two other fall regattas, the Head of the Charles and Foot of the Charles, both squads delivered strong performances again. The heavyweights and lightweights came in fourth and third at the Head of the Charles and second and first at the Foot of the Charles, respectively.
Radcliffe heavyweight crew opened the spring dual-meet season with 1V and 2V wins against visiting Tulsa before hosting Ivy foes Brown, Cornell and Princeton in the following weeks.
In the Black and White’s first test against Brown, poor racing weather on the Charles River forced the Ancient Eight duel to be moved to the Seekonk River in Rhode Island. The fifth-ranked Bears, buoyed with the home water advantage, edged out the Radcliffe heavyweights by 2.6 seconds in the 1V, while also sweeping the Black and White 2V, 3V and 4V by considerable margins.
In the subsequent weekend, Radcliffe hosted Princeton and Dartmouth in the Class of 1975 Cup Regatta. In the 1V, the Tigers surged away to capture the varsity trophy, while Cornell edged out the Black and White by two seconds for second place.
Faced with two weekends of close losses to higher-ranked teams, Radcliffe still remained optimistic of its strength and speed on the water.
This determination to find more speed fueled the Black and White as it entered the halfway mark of its dual-meet season with the Charles River Challenge. In the hotly contested 1V race, the heavyweights handily defeated three formidable opponents—Ohio State, Dartmouth and Northeastern—to pick up their biggest victory of the season.
Radcliffe carried this momentum into the next two meets against Yale in the Case Cup and Boston-based schools in the Beanpot. Against Yale, the heavyweight 1V knocked off the defending national champion Bulldogs by three seconds, marking the Black and White’s first victory in eight years against its oldest rivals. In the Beanpot, Radcliffe blew out the local competition to capture a fourth Beanpot title.
Like their heavyweight counterparts, the lightweights were also able to establish dominance over both Ivy and local competitors throughout the season with strong showings at dual meets.
After season-opening victories against Tulsa and MIT, the lightweights traveled to the Potomac to face Georgetown in the Class of 1974 Cup. In a closely fought battle on the water, the Black and White lightweights edged out the Hoyas by 1.2 seconds to retain the cup.
Inspired by a 3-0 start, Radcliffe looked to carry its momentum into its biggest test of the season—the matchup against second-ranked Stanford. But the Black and White fell to the Cardinal by six seconds for its first loss of the season.
The following week, Radcliffe matched up against Princeton and Bucknell. The Black and White split the two races on the day, recording a victory over the Bison but losing to the Tigers.
In the last meet of the regular season, the Radcliffe lightweights downed Cambridge rival MIT by more than 25 seconds to keep the Muri Cup and local bragging rights.
With its victory over the Engineers, the Black and White entered the Eastern Sprints on May 15 with confidence that it had achieved its season goals.
“We had a really good season where we feel that we improved with every race and we got closer as a team,” junior coxswain Maryana Vrubel said. “I think that we accomplished our goals of the season, which were to have a lot of fun together and to get better as a team.”
At the Eastern Sprints, Radcliffe’s three boats had strong showings in each of its races. The Black and White’s performance at the Sprints earned it second place in the overall standings.
“Eastern Sprints was very important to us because we had everyone, and not just one boat on the team, do well,” Vrubel said. “It showed us that with every year, we have consistently improved with new groups of individuals stepping up to take on the roles on our graduating seniors.”
The lightweights will wrap up their season at the IRA National Championships June 3-4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a secret they don’t tell you until it’s time to write a parting shot: these columns are tough.
My predecessors—men and women much more interesting than I am—have already produced heartfelt treatises on everything meaningful about The Crimson’s sports board. I could tell you that it was all about the friends I made (true), but I’m not the first person to feel this way. I could recount my favorite games, but the biggest moment in my career—Harvard’s third-ever individual wrestling title—took place while I was on an airplane. So, since past writers have covered the profound and the memorable, I’ll take this space to draw out an issue we usually try to ignore.
What I want to talk about is actually one of the biggest challenges in Crimson reporting: conflict of interest. I don’t mean the “hook-up-with-someone-you’ve-been-interviewing-routinely” conflict, or even the “I-only-picked-up-this-beat-because-everyone-on-your-team-is-hot” conflict; 1,000 words are not necessary to spell those out. Instead, I’d like to reflect on the difficulty that all Crimson reporters face: sharing the everyday experience of Harvard with our sources. This may seem like a no-brainer to other students—we constantly mix work and play with our peers when we follow up problem sets with 30 racks. But in the reporting world, this is pretty unique. I truly believe that the level of professionalism we bring to 14 Plympton puts us on par with publications across the country, but we never stop to think that New York Times reporters might not follow up a press conference with a cross-the-party head nod. Indeed, Washington Post writers never have to decide if a garden party is the appropriate place to discuss last week’s pitching performance. This is the world we live in, and the balance is more difficult than you’d think.
When I started comping the sports board my freshman spring, COI wasn’t really a problem. My ideal Thursday night involved movies and a box of pop tarts, so I had a legitimate blank slate when it came to varsity upperclassmen. When I signed up for my first story—a non-descript, mid-season wrestling match—I had no particular concern about calling a rising star named JP O’Connor. I began the interview the same way I would for the next three years: “How did you feel about the match overall?”
“Overall?” O’Connor responded. “What kind of a question is that? I don’t even know how to answer that. We each wrestled differently.”
I decided to call other sources for the next few weeks.
But after three All-America honors and a national championship, O’Connor got better at interviews, and I became much less terrified.
In fact, as I followed the team through countless injuries, struggles, and successes, the wrestling beat quickly grew into something much more than a hobby. The team appreciated how much attention I gave an often-overlooked sport, and I enjoyed the knowledge that interviews would always be painless and reliable. Without question, then, my bond with the team was a good thing. It made them happier, my job easier, and the stories richer. It was no different for my co-chair and her softball beat, or for 100 sports Crimeds before us.
Yet these benefits carry a challenge. A Red Sox reporter might be wary of bashing the team because it could cost him a week or two of quotes, but he has no fear of losing a friend. Certainly professionals can feel close to a group after watching them every season, but it’s another thing to see disappointment in the dining hall, jubilation on your walk to class, or your article on an athlete’s common room wall.
We’d like to think that we can separate our friendship from our work—that a memorable beer pong showdown won’t change our interview dynamic the next week—but this simply isn’t true. The largest arguments I ever had with my editors took place when my stories were “too nice” to the players, when I spun abysmal losses as close contests. Every time I was too proud to admit it, but every time they were right: I was more concerned with preserving my relationships than calling games how I saw them.
You might be thinking at this point that you’re reading a column about regrets, that I feel guilty for my sugar-coated reporting habits of the past four years. That’s not quite true either. As much as I cared about The Crimson, as much as I took my work seriously, I never forgot that we were a student newspaper. Our primary audience remains our peers, and I continue to believe that there is more value in highlighting their accomplishments than criticizing their performances. Others will always disagree with me, but each person can decide for him or herself what the purpose of our work is.
In the end, the best we can do is to be aware of the conundrum that is student reporting. A Crimed following a team through all its ups and downs will always forge a bond with the players. And even beyond the conflicts of friendship, our intertwined experiences will always leave us with difficult choices. Do we report on the nature of an injury if we saw it happen at a party? When a player feels comfortable gossiping about his or her teammates, is there any value in airing it across campus?
We face these decisions all the time. I have shared drinks with players the night before games, listened stone-faced to rants against captains and coaches, and witnessed my fair share of inter-team relationship drama. Most of the time, I felt comfortable with my choices to withhold (or report) such experiences. But could I have done a better job? Absolutely.
We like to talk at The Crimson about avoiding conflict of interest, but that’s really not the point. We take on competing interests the minute we agree to cover our peers, and to deny such complexities only hinders our work. After 1,000 words of this column, I still can’t tell you that my approach was right, or that there’s a better way to handle this challenge. But for future Crimeds, when you inevitably discover this tension, I encourage you not to ignore it, but to embrace it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two of last year’s starters graduated and another quit the team mid-year, the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 Harvard women’s golf teams hardly resembled one another. And to make matters worse for the squad, an influx of talented freshmen into the Ivy League made the conference that much stronger.
The odds were not in the Crimson’s favor, and for the first time in recent memory, Harvard failed to win a tournament all year.
But after a slow start in the fall, the Crimson dramatically improved its play by the end of the spring, finishing just four strokes behind Yale to take second place at the Ivy League Championships.
“What we accomplished during the year—I was very, very pleased,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “[But] it’s unfortunate not to win a tournament this year…It’s tough to be so close.”
At the beginning of the fall season, the team wasn’t close at all. In the Crimson’s first tournament, the Princeton Invitational, the squad finished a disappointing sixth out of 12 teams in the field. In 2008 and 2009, Harvard finished first and second, respectively.
“We played terribly,” captain Mia Kabasakalis said. “Just absolutely horrendously. And I think…because we’ve had such stellar years in the past, [everyone] thought that would carry over. But when people finally got to their first tournament and played badly, we were like, ‘Oh, why is this happening?’ ‘Oh, because I haven’t been practicing enough.’”
As the team began practicing more, both in and out of competition, the results began to improve. In the fall season’s final tournament, the Harvard Invitational, the Crimson finished second.
Even with the disappointment in the fall, the team did have one bright spot: the play of freshman Bonnie Hu. Named a “Freshman to Watch” by Golfweek magazine before the season, Hu didn’t disappoint, placing in the top six in three of the fall’s four tournaments.
By the year’s end, Hu, a Crimson business editor, managed a scoring average of 75.55, the lowest in team history. Hu also earned an individual selection for NCAA Regionals, another Harvard first.
“Bonnie is always an incredible player,” Kabasakalis said. “We’ll see incredible things from her for the next three years.”
Not even Hu could save the Crimson from a lackluster start to the spring season. After losing to Berkeley and Rollins in two dual matches, Harvard placed eighth in a field of 17 at the Georgetown Invitational on Apr. 4.
The Crimson rebounded sharply the following week at the Spring Brown Bear Invitational. On the first day, Harvard shot a 306 to take control of third place.
But it was the second day when the Crimson began to play like a potential Ivy League champion, shooting a year-low 291 to finish in second. Kabasakalis shot two-under par, the best score of her collegiate career, en route to a tie for fifth place among the 77 players in the field. Hu finished one shot behind the senior.
“After [the Brown] tournament, it got us into the mindset, ‘Wow, we’re so close [to winning],’ and we had come so far from where we started,” junior Christine Cho says.
After its strong performance at the Brown tournament, Harvard appeared to be a legitimate contender at the all-important Ivy League Championships the following weekend. And even coming into the final day of the three-day event, the Crimson had a chance, only two strokes behind Yale with a lot of golf left to play.
Harvard greatly improved its play between days two and three, dropping from a 309 to a 295 at the par-72 Atlantic City Country Club. But in the end, 295 in the third round proved to be four strokes too many, and Yale’s 293 gave the Bulldogs the crown.
“We did great [at the Ivy League Championships],” Rhoads said. “We had debatably our best tournament for the season, which is a huge goal for us. We’re trying to win Ivies every year,…[and] we were right there.”
Once again, Kabasakalis led the way individually for the Crimson.  Her +8 put her in second place overall, landing her an All-Ivy accolade.
“[Kabasakalis], at the end of the year, did exactly what every player and every senior and every captain would hope that they would do, which is: she super stepped it up,” Rhoads said. “Playing that well as a senior, as a captain, leading into graduation—that was huge. So I was super happy and super proud of her.”
From here, the team looks toward next year, when two talented freshmen, including a player who made the cut at the US Open, join the team.
And with only one senior graduating, Rhoads is excited for the 2011-2012 campaign.
“When you’re not quite as successful as you should be, a lot of times that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and it lays the foundation for working hard,” Rhoads said. “I think our experience this year and who we have coming in—I’m optimistic for next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
These days, the words “average” and “Harvard” can seldom be seen in the same place; the color of the Crimson is almost always one of excellence. But when it counted—in the Ivy League Championships—Harvard men’s golf could not live up to that standard, and the team finished toward the bottom of the Ancient Eight pack.
Despite dominating its competition at the Century Intercollegiate and finishing nine strokes shy of first place at the Northeast Invitational, the Crimson never quite seemed to get into the swing of things this season.
Harvard fell to sixth at the close of the Ivy League Championships, ending its campaign much like it began—in disappointment.
For Harvard, that unlikely adjective seemed to fit all too perfectly.
“Collectively, this season, on the whole, was just average,” coach Jim Burke said. “We played very well in some tournaments and not so well in some others, but overall, we were always right in the middle of the pack.”
Out of its nine contests this year, seven of the Crimson’s performances landed it just there.
Starting off the fall season against Princeton and Yale, Harvard finished second among the three rival schools. But the next week, the Crimson finished seventh out of a 15-team field that included the Tigers, who finished 2nd on the day, as well as the Big Green, who came in 12th.
In fact, until a strong second-place showing at the Northeast Invitational, the Crimson continually failed to crack the top tier of competitive play, placing 7th out of 14 at the MacDonald Cup and 12th out of 21 at the Big 5 Invitational.
Still, for Burke and his squad, there remained much to take away from their fall campaign.
“There were definitely bright spots,” Burke said. “We put up a lot of great individual performances, but we just never managed to get everything together at once.”
Junior captain Tony Grillo led Harvard by example, finishing among the top three from his team in every tournament. He paced the team and finished third overall at the Northeast Invitational.
The freshman pair of Theo Lederhausen and Seiji Liu also strung together some strong results. Lederhausen tied for fifth among individual players with his even-par performance at the MacDonald Cup. Liu beat both of his match-play opponents in Crimson’s first contest, and  he tied for third overall at the Big 5 Invitational after posting a score of one-over par.
Come springtime, the changing weather hardly meant a change for Harvard’s season. While individual players continued to shine, the squad struggled to break from mediocrity.
“We never had a shortage of really talented golfers,” Burke said. “Day in and day out, the juniors showed great leadership and the freshman kept improving. But we played poorly as a team.”
At the Yale Spring Opener, junior Mark Pollak’s stellar play tied him for first place among individuals, but the team’s combined 609 strokes only landed the team a 4th-place finish in a ten-team field.
Then, in the Princeton Invitational, despite a consistent three rounds from Pollak, it again proved not enough to make up for the Crimson’s poor putting. The team finished 8th out of 12, behind every other conference team besides Cornell with less than two weeks until the championship.
“We played poorly, especially against the Ivy League,” Pollak said. “We each made several costly mistakes and ended up unable to add up a couple good scores.”
In a week’s time, this was no longer the case. After rebounding to win their next tournament, the Century Intercollegiate, Pollak and the team looked poised to compete.
“We needed that confidence boost,” Pollak said. “This was one of the first times everyone came together and played well. We hung in there, fought it out, and were able to do well as a team.”
But, mirroring most of this season, the Harvard golfers had trouble finding success against the Ancient Eight in Galloway, N.J.
The Crimson finished 37 strokes short of the Ivy League title, besting only Brown and Cornell for sixth place and capping their season in what can only be described as an average performance.
“There’s nothing else to say,” Pollak said. “No one had a spectacular individual performance, and we couldn’t pull one together as a team.”
While the former claim may not be true—Pollak was awarded second-team All Ivy honors for his play—the latter was undoubtedly the story of this year’s squad.
“Our goal every year is to win the Ivy League,” Burke said. “It’s hard to do that playing the way we did. But with one more year under their belts, and some hard work in the summer, I think this team can change that result next year.”

The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams remained a consistent force within the Ivy League in the 2010-2011 season, one in which many strong individual and team bests were set.
“Overall, both seasons went pretty well for both our men’s and women’s teams,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “We gained some real improvement and established some real consistency in how we matched up in the Ivy League, and we also had some great individual performances throughout the season as well.”
During the indoor track season, the men’s squad finished 45th in a field of 51 teams at the IC4A meet and placed fourth at the Heptagonal Championships. The team took second in the HYP meet and third at the Battle of Beantown. The men’s squad was led at the IC4As by the performances of senior Brian Hill, who finished ninth in the 800-meter race, sophomore Fedor Garin who finished ninth in the men’s pole vault, and the relay team of freshman Erik Kraus, junior Darcy Wilson (an inactive Crimson business editor), sophomore Weishen Mead, and junior Brian Paison that finished sixth in the men’s 4x800-meter relay race.
The women’s squad earned several solid finishes throughout the season, highlighted by the Crimson’s successful defense of last year’s Battle of Beantown title. The women took fifth at Heptagonal Championships and earned a sixth-place finish at the ECAC Championship Meet, posting the highest team score for the women’s squad in school history.
Strong individual performances at these two championship meets included senior Hilary May placing second in the women’s 1000-meter run and senior Claire Richardson placing second in the women’s 3000-meter run.
“I think our season overall went pretty well,” Richardson said. “Our biggest accomplishment this season was coming together as a team, supporting each other and bonding across events groups, and using that to help support and motivate each other.”
The Crimson carried this individual momentum into the spring for the start of the outdoor track and field season. Outdoor competition began with the dispersal of both Harvard squads across the country on one weekend at three different meets. But despite the division of the team, the Crimson shined at Colonial Relays and Sam Howell Invitational and Snowflake Classic, with a number of athletes securing IC4A and ECAC-qualifying marks in the process.
Two weeks later at the annual Harvard-Yale meet in New Haven, Harvard faced off against the Bulldogs.  Despite the fierce winds, torrential rains, and frigid conditions, both Crimson squads captured historic victories over the Yale by taking 28 of 38 events for the day.
For the Harvard women’s team, this victory marked a third consecutive win over Yale, while the men’s squad celebrated the end of an eight-year losing streak against the Bulldogs.
At the outdoor Heptagonal Championships, the Crimson returned to New Haven looking to rekindle some of the magic of the Harvard-Yale meet. Although the Crimson men posted their best result in nearly eight years by finishing in fourth place in the overall standings, the Harvard women finished in a distant seventh place. On the men’s side, junior Nico Weiler took home first place in the pole vault, and freshman Dustin Brode earned a win in the shot put, both securing nods to the All-Ivy first team in the process. Senior Dan Chenoweth earned a second-team All-Ivy nod with a second-place finish in the 10,000-meter race.
“I don’t think [our record this year] reflected how much work everyone put into training during the outdoor season,” Richardson said. “But it is still a step towards where we want to be.”
Despite the women’s less than stellar overall performance at Heps, its day was punctuated by strong individual efforts by Richardson, who claimed the women’s 3,000-meter title with a time of 9:49.36, and a fourth-place finish by the 4x100-meter quartet of freshmen Christina Twicken, Meisha Brooks, Chelsea Celistan, and sophomore Olivia Weeks that posted its season-best time of 47.93. Freshman Hannah Mayer earned first place in the javelin, securing a first-team All-Ivy nod.
At the outdoor ECAC/IC4A Championships, the Crimson was led by Brode, who finished second in the shot put with distance of a distance of 17.03.
Looking back at the track season overall, Saretsky was quick to point out that the team’s successes would not have been possible without the leadership of his graduating seniors.
“The biggest thing that we had this year was the great leadership this year from our senior class,” Saretsky said. “All the seniors that we will be graduating are irreplaceable in what they bring in terms of their athletic ability but [also] in their leadership, personalities and charisma.
“We do have a great rising senior class and some incoming freshman that should continue the tradition and legacy that this year’s seniors created for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In spite of numerous injuries that marred their rosters, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams enjoyed a successful 2010 season. Both rookie and veteran members of the squads saw improvement as the season progressed, and many Crimson runners posted personal-best times over the course of the year.
“Both of our teams performed very well,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We had some things go our way, and, of course, some things that didn’t exactly go our way.”
One such misfortune for the men’s team occurred early in the season when members of the team sustained injuries that kept them out of competition. In particular, injured sophomores Jeremy Gilmour and Sean Pohorence were expected to be scoring runners for the Crimson.
In their absence, a group of first-years—Maksim Korolev, Kurt Ruegg, and Aaron Watanabe—rose to the occasion.
“Given how young [these runners] were, the success that they had was really exciting,” Saretsky said.
“They saw a lot of growth over the course of the season,” men’s captain Dan Chenoweth added. “Those guys really made an impact.”
Chenoweth made quite an impact of his own. For the third consecutive season, the Geneseo, Ill., native qualified for the NCAA Championships. Although he missed out on All-America honors, Chenoweth was named to the All-Region in the Northeast.
In one of his best performances of the year, Chenoweth captured a victory at the Harvard-Yale dual meet, finishing the 8k race in 25:10.7. Later in the season, the senior went on to capture second place in the Heptagonal Championship Invitational with a time of 24:14.0.
But Chenoweth wasn’t the only Crimson runner who garnered attention within the collegiate cross country world.
On the women’s side, senior Claire Richardson ran her personal-best time of 17:20.13 in the 5k at a Yale invitational early in the season, which was good for second place overall.
“[Richardson] demonstrated that she could be one of the top distance runners in the country,” Saretsky said. “She competed very well for us.”
Richardson’s performance was part of a streak of strong outings that the Harvard women’s squad put together to earn itself a No. 63 national ranking.
“The highlight of the season was the Pre-Nationals meet in Terre Haute,” women’s captain Eliza Ives said. “We did really well and put ourselves on the national spectrum.”
At the Pre-Nationals meet, the women’s team placed 16th out of 40 competing teams. The Crimson finished ahead of a nationally-ranked University of Florida team and expected to carry its momentum through the season’s final stretch.
But its progress was halted by a string of injuries to key runners.
“Towards the end, with injuries, our performance took a hit,” Ives said. “We definitely had the strength to have a really awesome end of the season, and that just didn’t happen.”
Still, Ives said she was proud of the season that she and her teammates were able to put together.
The senior is a member of Saretsky’s first class of recruits at Harvard, and she has noticed positive changes in the cross country program with him at the helm.
“He basically took a program that was struggling and wasn’t the best in recruiting and turned that around,” Ives said. “The fact that we were nationally recognized my senior year is something that I’m sure he couldn’t have dreamed of.”
Saretsky hopes that the program will keep making strides next season, and with Korolev, Ruegg, and Wanatabe all returning, he is optimistic for the road ahead.
“Our goal is to continue to progress,” Saretsky said. “Both of the teams have a lot of talent, so it should be a really exciting season for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patricia Kelliher has lived in Allston all her life, so when she wanted to open an American-style cafe, the neighborhood seemed like the perfect location.
“I would have loved to be in Allston, that’s my home,” Kelliher says with a touch of melancholy.
Two years ago Kelliher approached Harvard about leasing land on Western Avenue. She says it seemed like a great match: the University needed to fill empty lots and she wanted to start a small business. Kelliher says she contacted Harvard multiple times. She hired construction workers to draw plans and make budget estimates.  But ultimately the University was not interested in her offer. As a result, she opened the Happy Owl Cafe, a colorful corner restaurant serving vegetarian friendly subs and soups, in Brighton.
“It’s hard to keep small businesses if you don’t have strong support,” says Kelliher. “An institution like Harvard could be helpful in that sense.”
The University has leased 12 properties in Allston this year, a step forward in its promise to the community to bring service and retail outlets to the neighborhood. But Allston residents say that they continue to feel alienated from the planning process and are concerned that the new businesses do not cater to their everyday needs.
PROMISES DEFERRED
In December 2009, Harvard halted construction on the Allston Science Complex—a series of buildings with an estimated $1 billion price tag that were intended to be a mecca for stem cell research—due to financial constraints. With the project indefinitely paused, University President Drew G. Faust sent a letter to the community promising to focus on developing the neighborhood in other ways. Her approach to Allston was three-pronged: lease and improve vacant property, engage the community, and develop Harvard’s campus when feasible.
Earlier that year, Harvard presented Allston with a strategic plan outlining the University’s intent to demolish the Kmart and Frugal Fannies—located in the Brighton Mills Shopping Center—and instead create an amalgamation of open and residential spaces, and businesses that provide services and retail. The construction was part of a plan to reinvigorate Western Avenue, turning it into a thriving “main street.” Leasing vacant property in the neighborhood would also work toward this end.
In the past year, Harvard says it has advanced significantly in achieving its goals, leasing over 118,000 acres of land over the past six months and letting property to two restaurants, Stone Hearth Pizza Co. and Maki Maki, and a commercial bakery, Swiss Bakers.
“We have been as aggressive as can be in terms of bringing different types of opportunities into our spaces,” says University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp. “We are quite pleased with what we’ve been able to achieve.”
Although Harvard is unable to comment on its leasing negotiations, Allston Work Team Co-Chair Bill Purcell says that the University has tried to find businesses that will reinvigorate the neighborhood.
“Throughout we have looked at the needs of the community and there’s no question that the community has been interested in immediate retail opportunities,” says Purcell.
“Activity inspires further activity, ideas inspire further ideas,” says Christine M. Heenan, vice president for public affairs and communications. “I’ve already seen that happen in the past six months.”
NOT THE RIGHT FIT?
But Harvard’s land banking remains one of the most pressing issues bolstering tensions between the University and Allston residents. Community members say that since Harvard began surreptitiously purchasing property under a subsidiary of a different name they have suffered the loss of retail outlets, such as Kmart and Office Max.
Some community members say that leases to retail businesses providing everyday necessities have yet to appear, leaving another gaping hole in their lives.
Harry E. Mattison, a member of the Allston Task Force, says that the problem is not that Harvard is lagging behind in leasing land, but rather that the University is not listening to residents’ needs. He says that the kinds of businesses that the University is bringing to the neighborhood will not necessarily be assets to the community.
“Not too many senior citizens and people with young children are going to go to an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant,” says Mattison of Maki Maki, a Japanese restaurant to which Harvard leased space earlier this year.
Ray Mellone, chair of the Allston Task Force, says he would like to see services such as hair salons and barber shops and that there are already enough restaurants in the area.
Other residents note that would rather see more local businesses, like Kelliher’s Happy Owl Cafe.
“It’s too bad that they couldn’t have done something to help some of the local kids,” says Allston Civic Association President Paul Berkeley.
SERVING THE COMMUNITY
Despite some resident apprehension, the businesses that have leased property from Harvard, some of which have already moved in and others which have yet to do so, say they are excited by the prospect of serving the community.
Stone Hearth, a family-friendly pizzeria, will occupy an abandoned gas station, where a Citgo used to be.
Artwork from local middle schoolers cover the wall of Jonathan Schwarz’s Stone Hearth in Bellmont, MA.
“There’s doing well and then there’s doing good,” Schwarz says. “Not only does this idea influence our food and operations in terms of sustainability, but it also influences the way we relate to the community. I firmly believe that a business should be a part of the neighborhood, not just serve it food.”
Swiss Bakers’ owners, Thomas and Helene Stohr, were approached by Harvard to create their home base in Allston in addition to the one in Reading, MA. Aware of tensions, they say they plan on integrating themselves into the community as quickly as possible.
“We don’t have customers, we have guests ... mentally of course,” Thomas Stohr says with a chuckle. “We can’t wait to hug Allston people.”
While the sentiment may not be entirely mutual, residents say that some service and retail business is better than none at all.
“If the option is an abandoned gas station or Stone Hearth, of course we are going to choose Stone Hearth,” says Mattison.
Despite not being able to open her cafe in her neighborhood, Kelliher says that she looks forward to the new businesses’ openings.
“I’m hopeful and excited about the pizza, the bakery, and the sushi ... [Western Avenue has] been such a dead zone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past season, the Harvard football team used three starting quarterbacks, each of whom threw the same number of interceptions as touchdowns.
But thanks in large part to senior running back Gino Gordon, the Crimson offense still managed to finish second in the Ivy League in scoring, averaging over 27 points per contest.
The halfback had been very good as a junior, and was named to the All-Ivy first team after rushing for 632 yards and eight touchdowns.
But in 2010, Gordon exploded, rushing for 1059 yards—the seventh-highest single-year total in Harvard history—while ranking tenth in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) with 6.3 yards per carry. The senior also found the endzone a career-high 10 times—just the fifth player in Crimson history to reach that mark—while pacing a Harvard rushing attack that finished 19th in the FCS with 198 yards per game.
Along with Dartmouth junior running back Nick Schweiger, Gordon capped his season by winning the Asa S. Bushnell Cup, given to the Ivy League’s Player of the Year.
“It was great that I was able to win,” Gordon said. “I shared it with another really great running back. I was just grateful for the opportunity to play football here and be successful.”
It was not only Gordon’s greatness on the field that made his senior season noteworthy.  In addition to being named the Frederick Greeley Crocker Award winner for MVP by his teammates, the running back was named to the American Youth Football (AYF) Ring of Honor for success in the classroom and on the field.
AYF focuses on promoting “good sportsmanship, teamwork, high moral and physical standards and the importance of scholarship and athletic achievement,” and chose Gordon as one of just three collegiate players to receive the accolade. The other honorees included NFL players like the New York Jets’ Santonio Holmes and the St. Louis Rams’ Chris Long.
“It’s nice that AYF puts a very big emphasis on academics as well as athletics,” Gordon said. “The fact that they were able to honor me because I embodied those attributes in terms of going to Harvard and being a successful athlete—I was honored to be able to represent my school and myself in that manner.”
During the season, the senior had some of his best games in Ancient Eight play, rushing for 158 yards against Cornell, 109 against Columbia, and 204 against Princeton—a performance for which he won the New England Football Writers’ Gold Helmet as the top performer in the region.
“Gino was just awesome for us all season long,” senior quarterback Andrew Hatch said. “He’s just a great guy, a hard worker, a great teammate, and a talented running back. So it was really fun playing with him, and working with him, and watching him do so well for us.”
Gordon even ran for 113 yards against Penn, which led the FCS in rush defense and had not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 33 games until Gordon broke the mark. In his final collegiate contest, the senior completed his career with two touchdowns, leading the Crimson to a 28-21 victory over rival Yale in a game that Gordon called the highlight of his season.
The win capped one of the best halfback careers in Harvard football history. Gordon finished as the Crimson’s career leader in yards per carry at 5.3, and fourth on Harvard’s all-time rushing list with 2,643 yards.
“My personal goals always started with winning an Ivy League Championship,” Gordon said. “Individual accomplishments are kind of secondary. I never really thought about them as much. But the fact that I had such a successful year was really a testament to the coaching and a lot of the hard work of the offensive linemen. All four years here, I’ve had a very talented offensive line; this year was no different.”
Despite the success, it was often Gordon’s off-the-field personality that had the most impact on his teammates.
“He’s a great guy, a great leader, and a great role model,” said sophomore running back Treavor Scales. “To me, he currently is and always will be an older brother. He’s been a mentor, showed me the ropes of the system. He kept all of our heads on the field, made sure we were all mentally in the game, made sure everyone was alright, that our home lives were good, and he did that with everybody...He genuinely cares about everyone’s well being...not to mention he’s a hell of a player.”
After an accomplished career, Gordon says he is now waiting for the NFL lockout to end and hopes he can sign a free-agent contract to play at the next level.
“It’s going to be a long-shot, but I’m not quite ready to hang up my cleats yet,” Gordon said. “I really feel like I have a lot of football left in me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To win over a conservative Senator from Tennessee, it helps to know the South—as University President Drew G. Faust can attest.
During a meeting earlier this year with Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, Faust sat down across a table from a man who partly controls funding for Harvard’s largest sources of federal dollars at a time when the Republican party is seeking to make deep cuts in the federal budget.
But Faust managed to win over Alexander, taking one step toward assuring that Harvard would not face a major shortfall in funding.
Faust, who is descended from a long line of Tennesseans on her mother’s side, seized on the memorabilia from the state in Alexander’s office, finding common ground with the Senator in their shared roots.
Then she got down to business pitching higher education to the Senator.
Several times this year Faust has trekked down to Washington D.C., put on a smile, and made her case for Harvard.
After the financial crisis dealt heavy blows to both the University’s endowment and to the federal budget, Harvard is in a tight budgetary spot as it scrambles to continue funding ambitious science research and recruiting the most talented students.
Harvard receives roughly $600 million per year, largely in the form of grants, from the federal government. Counting the teaching hospitals, the total comes to around $1.2 billion annually. But now this source of funding is in peril as Congress is set to sharply cut spending for the coming fiscal year.
“Her concerns are not unfounded,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the assistant Senate majority leader, who has met with Faust in D.C. to discuss science funding and other legislation.
These challenging circumstances have forced university presidents to get their hands dirty in Washington politics, as they advocate for continued funding of research and student financial aid.
On these front lines, Faust is leading the way.
“In this budget environment you have no choice,” said Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Christine M. Heenan, “but to make your case early and often.”
According to historian and lecturer Stephen P. Shoemaker, Faust is the most politically active president in Harvard’s history since James Bryant Conant, Class of 1914, helped spearhead the Manhattan Project.
The magnitude of the current stakes in Washington has left Faust with no choice but to roll up her sleeves and wade into federal politics. “I try to be a face for Harvard that makes it seem an important part of the nation’s future,” she said. “I need to make that case. All of higher education needs to make that case.”
THE STRATEGY
When Faust goes to Washington, she brings a carefully crafted strategy, a bevy of data, and stories about the good work being carried out in Cambridge, all tied neatly together with a dose of charm.
Heenan said that universities must determine “how to best deploy their president as an asset toward their advocacy agenda,” evoking the language of battle and apparently emphasizing what is at stake for  Harvard in Washington.
This means employing Faust’s clout and political capital selectively to make headway with important lawmakers.
“I am more likely to get direct access to the principals and to be able make the case for higher education to people in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Faust said of her choice to travel to D.C. in certain instances, rather than send other University affiliates.
Harvard uses a two-pronged strategy, filling Faust’s itinerary with both lawmakers and journalists in the capital.
Faust has met with political bigwigs including President Obama, Vice President Biden, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, as well as journalists and other Washington insiders. During her trips to the capital her schedule also includes op-ed columnists, think-tanks, editorial boards, and other opinion makers.
This past year, Faust participated in a reporter roundtable, a type of off-the-record schmoozing used to give journalists insight into the challenges facing a university in a candid forum.
“I think this is a somewhat unique approach at Harvard to reach both lawmakers and those who seek to influence them,” Heenan said.
Though Faust’s team said that she attempts to make connections across the political spectrum, her efforts this year have been weighted toward Democrats, who by and large tend to be in favor of funding for Universities. Out of at least 17 meetings with politicians or government leaders in Washington this year, only 4 were with Republicans.
However, with the Republicans having recently taken over the House, University administrators are quick to emphasize that an effective lobbying strategy has to cross the political divide and reach out to GOP lawmakers.
“It would be a very dangerous thing if science became a partisan issue,” Heenan said.
When meeting with members of Congress, Faust comes armed with facts and figures about the cutting-edge cancer research conducted in Harvard laboratories. She also touts the student body’s diversity and the number of students who currently graduate without debt.
But as much as politics is about coming armed with the right data and a good argument, it also requires a bit of wit and charisma. Faust has found herself in unfamiliar territory on Capitol Hill, but it appears that she has embraced the role of winning over lawmakers with gusto.
Harvard and other elite universities are often criticized by conservative Washington politicians for being out of touch with the country’s mainstream. Therefore when lobbying Congress, Faust has had to grapple with what is perceived as a peculiarly Harvardian brand of elitism.
“I think universities are right now very much misunderstood,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman said. “A place like Harvard is mistakenly caricatured as an elitist bastion of peculiar beliefs.”
But with ties to the American South and a knack for recognizing shared roots, Faust has grown more adept at winning the hearts and votes of both liberals and conservatives.
Earlier this year, Faust met with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a darling of the far right and an influential Republican. Cantor represents a wing of the Republican party that is largely opposed to the initiatives being promoted by Harvard in Washington—stem cell research, for example—but in their home state of Virginia, the two found a shared love.
Before he left the meeting, Cantor told Faust that she needed to travel to Washington more frequently to ensconce herself as the face of Harvard and dismantle the image of the old, white Harvard man in tweed.
“It’s always important to try to make a personal connection with someone and treat someone like an individual person and not come in and act as if they’re just a vote,” Faust said.
As a president that lacks the strong Washington ties of her predecessor Lawrence H. Summers, who was Secretary of the Treasury before assuming the Harvard presidency, Faust has had to make up ground to establish herself as a presence in the nation’s capital.
“Before I ever met her she seemed like an imposing woman. A great scholar,” said Executive Washington Editor for Bloomberg News Al R. Hunt, who hosted the reporter’s roundtable. “The one thing that we’ve benefited from is seeing what an interesting and down-to-earth person she is.”
WADING INTO WASHINGTON POLITICS
The Office of Government, Community, and Public Affairs was founded in 1970s during President Derek C. Bok’s tenure, although it went by a different name at the time, according to Casey, who has been in involved in Harvard’s lobbying efforts for 20 years.
“Derek was very farsighted, and I am sure he could see the growing importance of the federal government to the University,” said Nan F. Nixon, who was one of Harvard’s first chief lobbyists.
The need for a University lobbying office goes back to the historic expansion of the federal government that followed World War II with the passage of the GI Bill and the creation of Pell Grants. These acts funneled money from Washington D.C. to U.S. universities, encouraging Harvard and others to jockey for position at the Congressional cash spigot.
But at the outset of Harvard’s lobbying activities, it was a far cry from the its current sophisticated effort. When Nixon was first hired she worked out of her apartment in D.C. and commuted to Cambridge each week. Eventually Nixon opened the doors at the University’s first Washington, D.C. office and added an assistant to her team.
Harvard was one of the very first universities to open a D.C. office, though many other schools soon followed suit, Casey said. MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago, and many other schools have all established a lobbying presence in D.C. In fact, the University of Michigan’s office is only a few floors up from Harvard’s.
Former MIT President Charles M. Vest—who is widely considered to have set the standard for university presidents’ active involvement in D.C.—said that he often encouraged other universities to focus the importance of funding for higher education and “not specifically on their universities.”
Many other schools, including Boston University and Tufts, hire lobbying firms to do most of the heavy-lifting in government relations. Harvard, however, maintains an internal team of lobbyists and only employs lobbying firms on occasion to work on specific issues, Casey said.
By having lobbyists who can call themselves a part of the Harvard community, administrators say that the University is better represented, allowing them to foster closer ties with lawmakers at the state and the federal level.
“The voices that represent Harvard are actually a part of Harvard,” Casey said.
During fiscal year 2009, Harvard reported that it lobbied on a variety of issues, including legislation affecting intellectual property law, legislation funding stem cell research and therapeutic cloning, appropriations for student financial aid, and science funding from organizations such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
Earlier this year Harvard also lobbied for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, Perkins Loans, and tuition tax credits, among other issues.
In fiscal year 2009, the University spent a total $465,946 on lobbying activities. This represents a modest decrease from previous years during which the University spent $578,480 in fiscal year 2008, and $697,700 in 2007. Casey said he believes fluctuations in spending were a function of heightened political activity during those years rather than University budget reductions.
In fiscal year 2009, $238,696—over half of the total spending—was used for “direct contact with legislators, their staff, government officials, or a legislative body,” which include Faust’s visits with politicians in Washington but not her contact with journalists, business leaders, or other Washington heavyweights.
According to the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group, Harvard has spent a total of $7.8 million on lobbying from 1997-2010.
Among its peers, Harvard is one of the biggest spenders on lobbying activity. During the same time period, Yale spent a little over $6 million, Stanford spent $3.9 million, and Columbia spent $2.2 million on lobbying activities.
Those dollars pay for a big presence—but they cannot buy everything.
PROMOTING THE DREAM
After Eric Balderas ’13 tried to board a plane in San Antonio using a Mexican consular card and his Harvard ID, he was detained by the authorities as an undocumented immigrant—and with his arrest Harvard became a player on the frontlines of the debate over whether undocumented youth like Balderas should be granted a path to citizenship.
The University adopted Balderas’ case as its own as a Harvard Law School professor agreed to represent him and Faust held him up to Congressmen as an example of why such students ought to be granted the opportunity to gain citizenship.
Faust led the charge among university presidents to advocate for the DREAM Act—one example of the way that she has pushed for a more activist role in Washington. Though immigrant rights activists mounted a major campaign to push the law through the Senate, it would stall after failing to garner sufficient conservative support.
But when Faust travels to Washington to advocate on behalf of a specific piece of legislation it also raises questions about when it is appropriate to put the Harvard imprimatur on certain policies, an issue that was particularly present in lobbying for the DREAM Act.
Some argued that lobbying for the DREAM Act overstepped the role of the president because it benefitted a group not directly tied to Harvard—but rather a limited population of potential Harvard students—and because it was a highly partisan issue backed heavily by Democrats.
But Durbin, who authored the DREAM Act and met with Faust on the issue, said he believes her endorsement is an important step in garnering broad support for the legislation.
In discussing her support of the DREAM Act, Faust often likes to tell the story of meeting with a group of undocumented students at the College, an experience that she has said convinced her of the urgent need to act on immigration reform legislation.
“I would draw the lines of appropriate engagement as issues having a direct impact on the University or its students in a way that inhibits them from fulfilling their educational goals, so that’s why I chose to speak on the DREAM Act,” Faust said.
But in these issues, Faust also has to consider Harvard’s position among its peers. When Harvard moves, other Colleges tend to follow, and that was apparent in Faust’s advocacy in support of the DREAM Act.
Heenan—who noted that several other university presidents followed Faust’s lead in backing the DREAM Act—said that as president of Harvard, Faust understands how she can use the bully pulpit to refocus public attention on the importance education.
“I think she is quite conscious in every setting of the fact that there will always be some that look to Harvard to set the standard and define the agenda,” Heenan said,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team’s 2010-2011 campaign is the tale of two seasons.
But for the first 22 games, it was just the worst of times.
After an abysmal 4-18 start, the pieces finally fell in place for the Crimson (12-21-1, 7-14-1 ECAC), which went 8-3-1 the rest of the way. The team’s late-in-the-season hot streak propelled it into the ECAC quarterfinals, where Harvard’s season ended in a loss to Dartmouth in a best-of-three series.
“We didn’t get a lot of momentum early on, and that obviously hurt us,” sophomore forward Marshall Everson said. “We had a couple bad losing streaks, but the last eight or nine games, I thought we played pretty well…We came together late, and we started to play our style of hockey.”
The season didn’t yet turn south for the first few games. Though Harvard fell to No. 15 Union, 2-1, in the year’s first contest, the Crimson responded with an upset over No. 18 Rensselaer and a win at St. Lawrence.
That’s when things started to fall apart. Harvard didn’t win another contest for nearly two months, and the next league victory didn’t come until another month after that. In the seven-game losing streak, the Crimson was outscored, 28-11.
Harvard hit rock-bottom in back-to-back 8-2 and 5-2 losses to Dartmouth.
“We played [Dartmouth] where…we were in one of those ruts that we went through, and it showed,” Everson says. “[Dartmouth’s] confidence took over in both of those games.”
A 4-2 win over Army on New Year’s Day ended the Crimson’s skid. But the next day, Harvard fell to Vermont, beginning yet another seven-game losing streak. And other than the lone 6-2 victory against Colgate, the worst team in the ECAC, Harvard didn’t win again until Feb. 14.
But in a one-week span in February, the Crimson managed to turn its season around.
It started with a brutal 4-0 loss against unranked Northeastern in the Beanpot opener. Harvard failed to get anything going all game and was sloppy all night. In a play emblematic of the Crimson’s season to that point, a shot by a Northeastern forward hit senior goaltender Ryan Carroll’s stick, and the puck bounced over Carroll’s head into the back of the net. After allowing four goals in two periods, Carroll was later pulled in favor of senior goaltender Kyle Richter.
“Coming out of the Northeastern game, no one could feel good about the way we played,” Everson said. “We had a long week of practice to think about it.”
After tying Princeton, a team that had beaten Harvard earlier in the year, in its next game, the Crimson came into the Feb. 14 Beanpot consolation match against Boston University with a little momentum. But the effects of the loss to Northeastern still lingered.
“[There] was a lot of frustration, some anger, but we also [saw] some benefits against Princeton of when we play more of our style of game,” Everson said. “I think we took that into the BU game.”
And that’s when things fell into place.
Harvard pulled off the improbable upset against the No. 15 Terriers, winning, 5-4, in a high-scoring showdown.
The victory proved to be the turning point of Harvard’s season.
“It was a confidence booster, winning that game,” co-captain defenseman Chris Huxley said. “If you have more confidence going into other games, then it helps.”
But confidence wasn’t the only factor in the Crimson’s rebound. The team also retooled its  previously poor power play with huge success. Up to and including the Northeastern game, Harvard successfully converted just 11.8 percent of its power plays. From then, the Crimson scored on power plays a whopping 32.7 percent of the time.
After the BU upset, Harvard started racking up the victories, winning four of five to close out the season and earn the 10-seed in the ECAC Playoffs.
In the first round, the Crimson had to trek Potsdam, N.Y., to face off against seventh-seed Clarkson. In the best-of-three series, Harvard needed only two games to close out the victory, winning 2-1 in the first game and 6-4 in the subsequent contest.
The following week, the Crimson met up with Dartmouth, a team that had crushed Harvard earlier in the year.
“We had two tough games against Dartmouth during the regular season,” sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom said.  “But we still knew that we had a very good chance of beating them.”
The Crimson did just that in the first game, winning 3-2. But from there, Harvard couldn’t keep up its torrid pace, as Dartmouth narrowly took the next two, 2-1 and 4-3, to win the quarter final series and end the Crimson’s year.
Despite the early exit from the ECAC tournament, the team was satisfied with the large strides it made during the season.
“We had a little rocky start, and maybe the first half of the season didn’t go as expected,” Fallstrom said. “[But then] all the guys started figuring out the systems and doing their roles, and…we became a high-caliber team.”

Even as a defenseman, Boston Bruins great Bobby Orr managed to lead the NHL in points.
Harvard sophomore Danny Biega has been the Bobby Orr of the Crimson men’s hockey team.
Biega’s 30 points, on 11 goals and 19 assists, were a team high, making him the first defenseman since Mark Fusco in 1981-82 to lead Harvard in scoring.
“When your leading scorer is a defenseman, [he is] always a threat because defensemen are out there so much,” sophomore forward Marshall Everson said. “When you have a kid like Danny who can skate all day and can play both ends of the rink so well, it’s so dangerous for the other team. He will shut down the first line of the other team, [and] then go score against them. When we have him on the ice, I feel like the game is tilted our way.”
Biega was the nation’s only defenseman both to finish among the top three on his team in plus-minus and lead the way in points. Overall, he led ECAC defensemen in points, goals, game winning goals, and short-handed goals. His 30 points were a significant jump from the nine he had freshman year.
“Its not to say he had a poor year freshman year...but after you play for a year in college, you understand the game better and get a little more mature,” co-captain defenseman Chris Huxley said. “It’s easier your sophomore than your freshman [to play well], and [Biega] will probably have a better year next year.”
The recognition of Biega’s professional potential was already high after last season.
He was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes with as 67th pick of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft and was one of only two players drafted that returned to school after being selected.
The Crimson was glad he stayed in Cambridge, as he awarded the John Tudor Memorial Cup as  Harvard’s most valuable player.
In addition to being named team MVP, he made the New England Hockey Writers Division I All-Star team, the All-Ivy League first team, and the ECAC Hockey all-league second team.
“I wouldn’t want to play against him in the next two years,” Everson said. “He’s going to be dangerous. Its just another thing to add to our confidence, knowing that we have him on the blue line, knowing he can score a lot of goals on any given night.”

Coming into the Beanpot consolation game, the Harvard men’s hockey team was in shambles. The Crimson held an abysmal 4-18-1 record, and just a week earlier, the team had been steamrolled by unranked Northeastern, showing no life in a 4-0 loss.
Against No. 15 Boston University for third place, victory—let alone a close contest—seemed like a longshot.
But suddenly, after a season of frustration, everything clicked.
In a back-and-forth game at TD Garden, Harvard came out on top, coming back late to shock the Terriers, 5-4, in a Valentine’s Day thriller.
The game didn’t begin the Crimson’s way. Less than six minutes in, the Terriers slapped the puck past senior goaltender Ryan Carroll to get on the board. It looked like Harvard was headed for yet another loss.
“When [BU] scored, we got a little déjà vu feeling,” sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom said.  “But we didn’t want a repeat of the Northeastern game. Losing against Northeastern was the worst thing ever.”
And so, the Crimson responded with its most impressive 73-second span of the 2010-2011 season.
Junior forward Daniel Moriarty’s game misconduct penalty at the end of the first period gave the Terriers a one-man advantage for five minutes, but Harvard did more than just kill the power play. Four minutes into the second period, Fallstrom passed to junior forward Alex Killorn, who put the puck in the back of the net to tie the score at one apiece. Just 54 seconds later, from the slot, junior defenseman Ryan Grimshaw added another goal to the Crimson’s total, giving the underdogs the one-goal advantage.
Nineteen seconds after Grimshaw’s score, Fallstrom found Killorn, who beat the BU goaltender once again.
“Between the first and second [periods], it really just felt like this was a game for us to win,” sophomore forward Marshall Everson said. “I thought that confidence showed right away when we scored those three goals.”
Harvard’s lead proved to be short-lived. At the 12:24 mark in the same period, the Terriers notched a power play goal to cut the lead in half. Less than a minute later, BU found the back of the net once more, tying the score at three. Neither squad managed a goal for the rest of the period.
The stalemate reigned through much of the third frame until the Terriers took advantage of another power play at the 14:05 mark.
The Crimson answered quickly. Just 1:52 later, sophomore defenseman Danny Biega, the team’s leading scorer throughout the season, snuck a shot from the point through a host of players and past the goaltender.
But Harvard wasn’t finished quite yet.
With just 2:08 left on the clock, co-captain forward Michael Del Mauro grabbed the rebound off of a shot by sophomore forward Conor Morrison and hit the puck past the goal line, giving the Crimson the important lead with little left on the clock.
In the remaining time, BU used everything in its arsenal to try and even the contest at five goals each. With 1:20 to go, the Terriers pulled their goalie and frantically fired shots at goal. In fact, in the period, BU outshot Harvard, 20-9.
But in the end, it wasn’t enough, and as the buzzer sounded, Harvard maintained its one-goal lead to earn the huge upset.
“We built a lot of momentum throughout the game, and even though they scored on us a couple times, I felt like we were the stronger team throughout the game,” Fallstrom said.
Despite the game’s high scoring, Carroll played an integral part in the team’s victory, making a season-high 45 saves. His play helped to neutralize the Terriers’ 20-shot advantage over the Crimson.
On the offensive end, Killorn led the way with two goals, while Biega had three points on the night with two assists and one score.
Harvard’s performance in the Beanpot contest was in stark contrast to the Crimson’s play less than a month earlier, when BU handily beat the squad, 5-2.
So for Harvard, the Valentine’s Day victory had larger implications than just a third-place finish in the Beanpot.
“The way we had a comeback a couple times, and the resiliency we showed was very important, not just for that game but [also] for the whole season,” Everson said.
“The BU win was a really big turning point for our season, especially since BU is one of the top teams in the country,” Fallstrom added. “It really showed that we could compete.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Big shoes can be a burden to fill. Rookie Gary Power on men’s squash lived up to the hype and competently replaced CSA national champion Colin West ’10 as the team’s No. 1. For the Harvard wrestling team, it was sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman who stepped into the spotlight in a big way this season, despite the squad’s overall lack of success.
The standout achieved a level of success that brings back memories of last year. J.P. O’Connor ’10 accomplished the ultimate feat when he put the wrestling program at the forefront of Harvard athletics with his win at the NCAA championships at 157 pounds.
This year was a similar story. Peppelman followed up on O’Connor’s successful season with an eighth-place finish at the NCAA tournament in the same weight class.
“Everyone was ecstatic,” sophomore Steven Keith said. “It was just an unbelievable feat to just be able to wrestle your way through a top, top tournament the way that Walter did. He came back really strong and stormed his way through the wrestlebacks.”
But his success at the NCAA tournament is not the only thing that garnered Peppelman the distinction of being one of the best Crimson athletes this year. His dominating performances over his opponents, his accomplishments throughout the year other than his finish at the NCAA tournament, and his ability to step into one of the key positions all cemented his candidacy for this distinction.
Coming into the year, junior Corey Jantzen probably held the squad’s best chances for placing at the NCAA tournament, but when a torn elbow ligament sidelined Jantzen for the remainder of the season, Peppelman stepped into the key role on the team, and he achieved enough success to represent the Crimson at the NCAA tournament, He did not disappoint.
Over the course of the season, Peppelman amassed a 33-9 record, placing him at seventh for the most wins in a single season for the program’s history. In dual competition alone, Peppelman was even more dominant, racking up 16 wins to just one loss. In his 33 victories, he pinned his opponents eight times, doubling his career number of pins.
Apart from eighth-place finish at the NCAA Championships, he also earned All-American and first-team All-Ivy accolades. Even with all of the success, Peppelman still has two more years with the squad to go even further at the NCAA Championships and try to bring home Harvard’s fourth national title. Harvard coach Jay Weiss is hoping to improve Peppelman’s game in some key areas to make him an even stronger competitor.
“The first thing is confidence,” Weiss said. “Now, he has the confidence to compete at that level. He pretty much has to be solid in every aspect of the game: on your feet, offensively, defensively, on top and on bottom…I think his goal of becoming a national champ is a lot clearer now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Keith Wright had been a very solid contributor for the 2009-10 Harvard men’s basketball team.
As a sophomore, the center averaged a respectable 8.9 points and 4.6 rebounds in 21 minutes a game, despite being largely overshadowed on the squad’s roster by senior Jeremy Lin ’10 and freshman Kyle Casey, who won the Ivy League’s Rookie of the Year.
But in 2010-2011, with Lin graduating and Casey dealing with a foot injury, Wright developed a reliable short jumper, improved his post moves, and became a star.
Before the season, the junior was named the team’s co-captain, and with that distinction came the added responsibility of being a leader during both games and practices—a message Wright took to heart.
“Something that I look back at and I’m really proud of was that practices were at a different level this year,” Wright said. “Coach [Tommy] Amaker told me once that he wanted me to be a better practice player, and that would end up translating on the court.”
The impact that extra effort had on Wright’s game was immediately evident. Playing without Casey early in the year, and with little talent surrounding him in the frontcourt, Wright picked up the slack both in the paint and on the boards.
He began his season with 22 points and a career-high 16 rebounds against future top-25 team George Mason, setting a tone early on that he would be Lin’s replacement as the Crimson’s go-to guy.
The success would continue to come with Casey out, as Wright recorded 18 points and six boards in Harvard’s second game of the season—a victory over Holy Cross—and then followed that up two games later with 24 and 10 in a win over Bryant.
In Harvard’s subsequent contest, Wright recorded 19 points, nine rebounds, and six assists in a win, dominating in front of the 15 NBA scouts on hand to watch Colorado guards Alec Burks and Cory Higgins. For that performance, Wright took home his second Ivy League Player of the Week Award.
“Keith worked really hard on his body, on his conditioning,” said fellow junior co-captain Oliver McNally. “I think that’s where it started...that carried over onto the basketball court. Our offense runs through him; when he plays well, we play well.”
The center continued his strong non-conference play as the season went on, recording double-doubles against future NCAA Tournament teams Michigan (18 points and 10 rebounds) and Boston University (17 and 10), and scored 18 with seven boards against the big frontcourt of future national champion UConn.
During Ancient Eight play, Wright continued to excel, pacing the Crimson with 15.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game while leading the squad to a share of its first-ever Ivy League title.
The center scored in double-digits in every Ivy contest—highlighted by a career-high 25 points in a double-overtime victory over Penn—and recorded double-doubles against Brown twice, Cornell twice, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Columbia.
At the end of the year, Wright had been the best player on the best Harvard basketball team in the program’s hundred-year history. He finished third in the Ancient Eight in scoring with 14.8 points and second in rebounding and blocks with 8.3 and 1.8, respectively.
Wright also ranked 15th in the country with a 58.4 percent shooting percentage while starting all 30 games after missing time due to illness and injury his first two seasons.
“My first goal was just to make it through the season healthy and just help the team the best way I could,” Wright said.
The awards began to pour in: Ivy League Player of the Year and unanimous first-team All-Ivy. AP All-America Honorable Mention. Lou Henson All-American team. NABC All-District First Team.
“I’m very blessed to have received the accolades that I have,” Wright said. “It’s all because of my teammates. We’re all in it together. I feel like every award I won we won as a team; I wouldn’t be anything without those guys.”
It was those teammates, along with his coach, who named Wright the squad’s Raymond Lavietes Most Valuable Player, Hamilton Fish Most Improved Player, and team-captain once again for the 2011-2012 season.
And perhaps most importantly, throughout his breakout season, Wright genuinely enjoyed playing the sport he loves.
“Just being able to spend time with my teammates, practicing, hanging out, and enjoying their company was really the high point in my season,” Wright says. “This year has been the most fun I’ve ever had playing basketball.”

In the 2006 fall season, the Harvard women’s soccer team struggled to find a rhythm, winning only three games the entire year. In 2007, things changed. Led by new head coach Ray Leone and a blonde-haired girl from New Jersey, the Crimson found a new winning style, raking out a 10-6-1 record.
While Leone brought a new direction to the team, Katherine Sheeleigh, the blonde-haired freshman, brought what her teammates called a new competitive fire that landed her the title of Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
“It’s going to be really depressing coming back in the fall without her on the team,” junior Melanie Baskind said. “I think she has been such a defining part of the program since she’s been here. I mean, Rookie of the Year as a freshman, and then she goes out as Ivy League Player of the Year.”
With a league-leading 80 shots, the Rookie of the Year grabbed a team-high eight goals in her freshman season, including a hat trick in her seventh game as a Harvard athlete.
For the next three years of her Ancient Eight career, Sheeleigh was just as good on paper as on the pitch. Named first-team All-Ivy all four years and honored with All-American nod this year, Sheeleigh finished her time with the Crimson ranked sixth in Harvard history with 79 points and fifth with 31 goals.
“She is so competitive, so passionate about the game, teammates, and trying to win,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “She would be marked by everyone’s best defender all of the time in four straight years, so she led by example. She held a high standard for herself, and it showed.”
The 2008 season showcased Sheeleigh’s high standard, as the sophomore helped Harvard to its first Ivy Championship in nine years with six goals, including three game-winners. In 2009, Sheeleigh again led the team in goals (8) and assists (5) as the Crimson won its second Ivy championship in as many years.
“I was looking at the numbers, and she’s one of the best players to ever put on a Crimson uniform because she did everything on our team,” Leone said.
While Harvard did not win another championship this year, Sheeleigh managed 25 points, good enough to lead the Ivy League, and tied Baskind with nine goals. Recognized for her talents, Sheeleigh became the 19th overall draft pick this year in the Women’s Professional Soccer League. Chosen by the Boston Breakers, Sheeleigh is the first Crimson female soccer player to be drafted to the WPSL and only the second player to be drafted in any women’s soccer league following Emily Stauffer ’99.
“It brings a lot of publicity to our program,” co-captain Gina Wideroff said. “It shows that we can compete at the next level. We’re not just soccer players trying to get a good education—we are good soccer players.”
Sheeleigh’s decision to take the year off and study physical therapy instead of playing for the Breakers illustrates her competitiveness off the field, another “Sheeleigh trait” that the team will miss.
“She’s very competitive and very driven, so when she sets a goal, she’ll most definitely reach it,” Wideroff said. “She’s willing to do whatever it takes to get where she wants to be, which is why she makes such a great soccer player, such a great leader, and friend.”
This competitive spirit was best exemplified in this year’s 2-1 overtime loss against Sienna when Sheeleigh notched the 28th goal of her career.
“She just ran straight at the goalie and somehow ended up stealing the ball from the goalie and then scoring,” Baskind explained. “The rest of the team was on the other side of the field, the goalie had the ball, yet Sheeleigh stripped her and scored. It was just so classic, because she works so hard on and off the ball and makes plays happen.”
And while this year’s squad gets ready to welcome a new class of recruits ready to make their marks, they realize that Sheeleigh’s competitive drive and ability to make things happen will be missed.
“Sheeleigh pretty much is and was Harvard soccer for the time that she was here, and we’re going to miss her a lot,” Baskind said. “Awesome person, great leader; [she] really raises the competition every day at practice. She’s a big loss.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the White Building in University Park, Pa., freshman foil fencer Alexandra Kiefer stepped onto the piste for the first time in Crimson. It was the first meet of the season—the Garret Penn State Open—and Kiefer held modest expectations of how her season would progress.
Princeton foil fencer Hyun-Kyung Yuh came to the piste to face off against Kiefer, but before long Yuh was furiously defending herself against Kiefer’s deft attacks and superior swordsmanship. At the end of that bout, Kiefer recorded the first win of her collegiate career.
“It was a good first bout,” Kiefer said.
The freshman couldn’t have asked for a better start to her rookie season.
“I was actually really nervous before,” Kiefer said. “I wasn’t sure how it was going to go, but after that bout what hit me was a wave of relief, and from there I was definitely ready to fence after that.”
Just hours into the start of her collegiate career, the highly-touted recruit was lining up toe-to-toe against some of the toughest competitors she had ever faced. Yet Kiefer’s resolve was unyielding as she outdueled collegiate fencing veterans and newcomers alike to climb up the leaderboard.
By day’s end, Kiefer determination paid off, as she finished in first place to claim gold in the individual foil at her first competition as a collegiate fencer.
“I think that Alex is quite remarkable and unique in her ability to make up her mind and set credible goals for herself but also follow through with them,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “In other words, there are a lot of people out there with goals and aspirations, but long term, it is very difficult for them to see them realized because they are unable to sustain the effort needed to attain those goals.”
Kiefer continued her dominance through the early season slate, taking honors at the Sacred Heart Invitational and St. John’s Super Cup while leading Harvard to victories over defending champion Penn State in both tournaments.
And when the whirlwind Ivy League Championship began, the rookie was more than up for the challenge.
In the Crimson’s Ancient Eight tournament in Princeton, N.J., Kiefer made perhaps her best showing of the regular season.
Over the course of the two-day event, Kiefer went 15-3 to finish second in the individual foil standings. Harvard went 4-2 in the Ivy League Championship’s round-robin duals format, led by Kiefer’s foil squad that went a perfect 6-0.
Kiefer’s consistency and ability to grind down the competition proved vital to the Crimson’s success, both in the regular season and in the postseason.
At the NCAA Fencing Championship in Columbus, Ohio, the freshman ended her rookie season the same way that she started it—standing at the highest platform on the podium.
In her first national exposure as a member of a college team, Kiefer slashed through the field in the round-robin competition, totaling 18 wins over the two days of the tournament with 103 recorded touches and a staggering +42 scoring index.
Entering the medal round of tournament as the second seed, Kiefer faced off against St. John’s Evgeniya Kirpicheva in the semifinal and earned a tight 15-12 victory to advance to the championship bout.
In the final, Kiefer once again owned the piste and waltzed away with the foil title after a commanding 15-7 victory over Princeton’s Eve Levin.
Kiefer finished the season with an overall record of 62-7, an All-Ivy first-team selection, and an individual national title to her name.
The freshman became the third female national champion in Harvard fencing history and the second female champion in two years, following in the footsteps of junior teammate Caroline Vloka, who claimed the sabre title last year.
Despite having achieved some of the greatest personal goals for which a college fencer can aim, Kiefer is still looking for ways to improve as a fencer and as a teammate.
“I’m definitely excited to fence again for Harvard,” Kiefer said. “I’m obviously hoping that I fence at the same level as I did this season, but I’m also excited to work and improve with our new team members and be a greater part of our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 40 Crimson athletes were named first-team All-Ivy during the 2010-2011 seasons.
One athlete received the honor twice. Her name is Melanie Baskind.
Baskind, a captain of the Harvard women’s lacrosse team in 2011 and a newly-elected captain of the soccer team, had a remarkable junior campaign to say the least.
In the fall soccer season, Baskind finished tied for first in the Ivy League in goals with nine. In the spring lacrosse season, Baskind finished 13th in the conference in scoring, averaging 1.75 goals per game.
“Mel is the most unbelievable person that I know,” said fellow soccer captain Lindsey Kowal. “Her character and personality are unparalleled.”
Despite being tabbed by some as the top lacrosse recruit in Massachusetts during her senior year at nearby Framingham High School in Framingham, Mass., Baskind at first decided to focus solely on soccer at the collegiate level.
She made her mark on the soccer pitch immediately, earning the 2008 Ivy League Rookie of the Year Award. But after her sophomore soccer season, Baskind felt one sport just wasn’t enough.
That spring, she picked up her lacrosse stick for the first time since high school and immediately entered the starting lineup. The sophomore rookie made the transition look seamless, starting all 15 games and finishing second on the Crimson in scoring.
If there were any questions about whether Baskind’s lacrosse play would hinder her performance on the soccer field, they were quickly answered this fall.
Baskind started 16 of 17 games, boasted the highest shooting percentage on the team, and had a career-high nine goals.
In one memorable contest against Princeton, Baskind accounted for all four of Harvard’s scores in the 4-0 win, finishing with two goals and two assists.
This spring, Baskind captained the lacrosse team to its best finish since 1994, finishing first on the Crimson in groundballs and fourth in scoring.
But Baskind’s teammates were most impressed by her ability to step up when the team needed it most. When the Crimson trailed 6-0 to New Hampshire on April 1, Baskind ended Harvard’s scoring drought with an unassisted score that ignited an 8-0 Harvard run.
“Mel is a huge momentum player,” lacrosse teammate Danielle Tetreault said. “She’s one of those people that leads by example. People feed of Mel’s energy.”
Despite her personal accomplishments this past year, Baskind was most excited by the growth she saw in both the soccer and lacrosse teams.
“[Getting named first-team All-Ivy] is a nice perk, but it was more of a fun year just in terms of both the teams really getting better and seeing so much improvement from last year,” Baskind said.
Looking forward to next year, Baskind hopes that improvement will earn her a different award—Ivy League titles.
“The goal right now is to win two Ivy championships next year, and I think it’s a pretty realistic goal,” Baskind said. “I don’t even feel like I’m shooting for the stars by saying that one.”

To close out the 2009-2010 squash season, then-senior Colin West ’10 captured a CSA National Individual Championships and led Harvard to a fifth-place finish at the CSA Team National Championships. Upon graduation, West’s departure left a big question mark at the front of the Crimson lineup.
Enter freshman Gary Power.
Jumping into untested waters in his first collegiate match, Power dominated at the No. 1 spot, cruising to a 3-0 victory in which his opponent scored a total of only 15 points.
“Gary was awesome from day one,” captain Reed Endresen said. “He comes out to practice with a great mindset. He has some good goals for himself and comes to practice and wants to win.”
Power’s proficiency at Harvard’s top spot only continued as the season progressed, culminating in an impressive performance at CSA Individual Championships. Though Princeton’s Todd Harrity took home the Pool Cup this year, Power finished the weekend ranked seventh in the nation, and, with the performance, secured first-team All-America status in his rookie season.
This year, though capped on both ends by stellar performances, was not without its challenges. In a long, tight match against Yale’s Hywel Robinson, Power came out on top after taking game five, 12-10. Power lost the first and fourth games en route to the win; despite the comeback, the rival Bulldogs earned a 7-2 victory over the Crimson.
“My toughest match was the Yale match,” Power said. “It’s bittersweet…so that one really stands out in my memory.”
Power finished the season with an impressive 10-5 record at the competitive first slot. Though he fell in three sets during the regular season to Harrity, the eventual national champion, Power recorded several other key victories.
One of Power’s biggest wins came against Trinity, which finished the 2010-2011 campaign by earning its 13th straight national team championship. After dropping the first game, Power came back to win the next three in a row, handing Parth Sharma of the undefeated Bantams his first individual loss of the season.
Power also posted a strong showing against his Dartmouth counterpart, earning a victory over Christopher Hanson in five games. Down two games to one, Power took the final two sets, 11-2 and 11-7, respectively, to win the match and help Harvard secure a 7-2 victory.
At the national team championships, Power dropped a tough contest against Cornell’s Nicholas Sachvie in the fifth-place match, but the Crimson was still able to take down the Big Red and claim the No. 5 spot in the nation.
Though Power played a large role in Harvard’s success this year, he had a lot of help from a strong upperclassman core and three other freshman who played in the Crimson’s top nine this season.
Power has set impressive goals—both individual and team-oriented—for the rest of his squash career at Harvard: reinstate the Crimson’s overall dominance over Ivy League and national squash and attempt to break into the top individual spots.
“Next year, we have a really strong recruiting class coming in again,” Power said. “We’re looking to win a national championship. It may not be possible next year, but it’s definitely something we can accomplish in the next two or three years. That has to be a goal for us going forward.
“I would love to get up there and be one of the top guys in the nation,” he continued. “I finished seventh [at nationals] this year, but I’d love to be that number one guy. [Harrity is] very good…but I want to try to be the best.”
So far, so good. Power has more than matched up with his opponents in his rookie campaign, and in Harvard’s toughest matches, has consistently taken on the top players in the league.
“He’s a great kid,” Endresen said. “He’s working his tail off every day, and he’s going to do great things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard women’s squash won its first nine matches of the year, the team lost its spot atop both the Ivy League and the national rankings after dropping contests to Yale in both the regular season and the postseason.
“We had a tough season because we didn’t go undefeated and unfortunately lost that national final,” said sophomore Laura Gemmell, who throughout the season played in the No. 1 spot. “But I think everyone worked really hard, and everyone made individual improvements in their game.”
The Crimson (11-2, 5-1 Ivy) faced great expectations going into the season.
While the team had a successful season by most standards, the two 5-4 losses to the No. 1 Bulldogs left Harvard short of reaching its ambitions.
“We had some pretty close matches with Yale, and we were disappointed that we lost, but we did try hard,” junior No. 2 Nirasha Guruge said. “Yale got the better of us this year, but I think we will come back stronger next year.”
The team started the season on a dominant run, winning nine in a row and taking its first six matches, 9-0.
But the competition became a little stiffer when the undefeated Bulldogs faced the then-No. 2 Crimson in the defacto Ivy League championship.
Yale took two of the first three matches, but Harvard came back to tie the score at three apiece. Then-No.1 Gemmell won her match in three sets, giving the Crimson an edge, 4-3. But the Bulldogs responded by winning the final two matches and claiming the 2011 Ivy League title.
It was Harvard’s first loss since February of 2009.
The Crimson then prepared for the final team competition of the year—the CSA Team National Championships—in hopes of winning a second consecutive national championship.
“We had the goal of winning the nationals, but I don’t think the expectations got to many people,” Gemmell said. “Most people didn’t really think about it. If you look at our team, we have multiple national champions. We have people who have played in world championships. I don’t [believe the players] were putting too much pressure on themselves this year.”
In the opening rounds, Harvard regained its dominance en route to a 9-0 shutout of Cornell, followed by a victory over Trinity, 6-3, in the semifinals.
With that victory, the Crimson advanced to the finals for a rematch with Yale.
The Bulldogs again jumped out to a 2-1 lead, but Harvard would come back to tie the match at four all. Yet in a repeat ending, Yale pulled out the final set and was crowned the 2011 CSA Women’s National Team Champion.
“Even though we lost the national final, we still had a great season,” Gemmell said. “I’m incredibly proud of our whole team, and it’s just going motivate us for next year.”
The team tried to put the tough loss behind it by vying for individual honors at the 2011 CSA Individual Championships in Hanover, N.H.
Guruge made it to the semifinals while Gemmell reached the finals, hoping to once again repeat as the individual national champion. At that point, the sophomore was undefeated in her collegiate career, having won 32 straight matches.
Gemmell took on Bulldog freshman No.2 Millie Tomlinson. Tomlinson won a close first set on her way to a three-set victory, making the Eli the national champion in the Ramsay division, the competition’s top tier.
In the Ramsay first-round consolation bracket, Crimson junior Cece Cortes won, defeating sophomore teammate Natasha Kingshott in four sets in the finals.
The team is looking to continue its success in 2011-2012. The players believe they have the chance to accomplish the goal with the return of two first-team All-Americans, Gemmell and Guruge, and second-team All-Americans in Cortes and Kingshott.
“We have a really strong freshman class coming in, and we [will] keep a lot of our top players on the team this year,” Gemmell said. “I think everyone is really excited, and we’ll have a really strong season next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite dropping all three contests in the first cycle of its final matchup at the CSA National Championships, the Harvard men’s squash team (9-6, 3-3 Ivy)—led by impressive performances from sophomore Alex Ma and captain Reed Endresen—defeated Cornell to secure a fifth place finish for the second straight year.
“We went down, 3-0, and both Reed and Alex Ma were down two games to love,” said freshman Gary Power, who played No. 1 for Harvard as a rookie. “Obviously we play to five games, so things weren’t looking good, but both of them came back to win. It was very exciting, with a lot of energy.”
The comeback served as a fitting end to a solid year of squash in which the Crimson maintained its place near the top of national standings despite a few major changes from last year’s squad—including the graduation of 2010 CSA Individual Champion Colin West and a coaching change that saw Mike Way take the helm of the Crimson.
“Overall, it was a great season,” said Endresen who played most of the season at the  No. 2 spot after starting the year in the fifth slot. “We were a young team, had a new coach. Everything was new. We really came together in the end.”
Although Harvard lost to Princeton, 8-1, in the first round of the CSA Championships, the Crimson came back in its second day of competition to defeat Dartmouth by the same score, earning a chance to take on Cornell in the fifth-place match.
“We didn’t lose any ground,” Endresen said. “We finished fifth last year and fifth again this [year]. It was nice to not slip and to beat Cornell in our final match.”
The last victory of the season was especially sweet for Harvard, as the team had suffered a heartbreaking 7-2 upset at the hands of the Big Red in regular season play.
“We went [to Ithaca] thinking we were going to beat them right before [winter] break,” Endresen said. “We came back after New Year’s and trained very hard, hoping we would play them again. It was a crazy match.”
Another big match for the Crimson came against 13-time defending national champions Trinity. Although Harvard suffered a 6-3 defeat at the hands of the Bantams, the three individual victories and many other close losses marked a vast improvement for the Crimson, which was swept, 9-0, in the previous season.
Power, freshman Tommy Mullaney, and junior William Ahmed picked up victories for Harvard, while four Crimson athletes took one game before dropping their respective individual matches.
“To only lose to Trinity, 6-3, and have a couple guys losing in four or five was really big for us,” Endresen said.
Harvard suffered a close defeat at the hands of rival  and Ivy League Champion Yale, 7-2, as Power and Mullaney earned individual wins over the Bulldogs.
The Harvard team—which graduates just two seniors, Endresen and Richard Hill—looked to youth this season, with four freshmen playing in the top nine.
“We got really lucky this year with a strong recruiting class,” Power said. “And they’re good guys, too…The combined freshman had a great first year.”
The four freshmen—Power, Brandon McLaughlin, Nigel Koh, a Crimson business editor, and Mullaney—each earned winning percentages above the .600 mark on the year.
“With a team as small as ours and with only nine players scoring, having four freshman in the top nine is pretty significant,” Endresen said. “[As upperclassmen], we really tried to get them adjusted school-wise and help them balance that with squash, telling them it’s all worth it. It’s a draining season, and you have to be in it for the long haul.”
Senior leadership also played an integral part of the team’s success this season.
“I think the number one thing that helped us this season was [Hill] and [Endresen],” Power said. “They were always working hard and are the first ones in to practice…[Endresen} started out the year playing No. 5. He’s is a good example of how working hard, training really hard, and being healthy really help your game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The book is called ‘The Scandalous Gospel of Jesus: What’s So Good About the Good News.’ What’s so scandalous about it?” Stephen Colbert asked his guest on the show.
“I want to sell books,” the late Rev. Peter J. Gomes replied.
During a 2008 taping of “The Colbert Report,” Gomes turned the tables on the ordinarily quick-witted host. Hearing Gomes’ response, all Colbert could do was laugh.
Gomes would come to be known, in part, by his voice—its rich humor, its melody, its power, and its timbre. Though he died in February, his voice—and all that it stood for—will continue to resonate in the memory of those who knew him.
A gay, black, Baptist minister at Harvard, Gomes had great significance to many people during his 35 years as the Pusey Minister of Memorial Church and the Plummer Professor of Christian  Morals. During that time, he became the University’s incomparable spiritual leader and leaves behind a profound legacy. He played an instrumental role in shedding light on Harvard’s history, speaking for the voiceless, spreading “the good news,” and forcefully rallying on behalf of justice.
AN INSTITUTION WITHIN AN INSTITUTION
Last year, Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey G. Cox Jr. decided to graze a cow in Tercentenary Theater, one of the rights associated with his endowed chair but one that had not been practiced in over 200 years.
Worried that security guards might interrupt the occasion, he consulted Gomes, a long-time friend.
Gomes responded with his typically powerful voice and self-assuredness.
“They would never dare,” he said, according to Cox.
Preserving Harvard’s history was an important mission for Gomes, who created the course Religion 1513: “The History of Harvard and Its Presidents.”
A frequent visitor to the Harvard Archives, Gomes would often pour through the annals of the University’s history, according to Jan C. Randolph, his long-time executive assistant who spoke during Gomes’ memorial service.
Even before he made history at Harvard, Gomes was considered Harvard’s historian, according to Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer in History and Literature who has known Gomes since his time at the College.
“There was probably no one here at Harvard who knew the institution both experientially and historically the way Peter did,” McCarthy said.
With the portrait of Gomes hanging in the Nathan Pusey Room in Memorial Church, he has become a part of the Harvard history that he has sought to preserve.
“He was a Harvard icon, one of those larger than life personae that makes so rich the History of Harvard, to which he now belongs,” Andrew F. Saxe ’84, a close friend of Gomes, wrote in an email.
SHOUTS AND CHEERS
The crowd erupted in cheers as Gomes’ booming voice echoed his now famous declaration: “I am a Christian who happens as well to be gay.”
The year was 1992, and the United States was in the midst of a culture war.
Gomes’ coming out alongside other members of the faculty was a momentous occasion at Harvard—an institution in the middle of transition.
“[When he came out], he showed us how to be a particular kind of gay person in the world, not one that sort of conforms to stereotypes of what it means to be gay,” McCarthy said.
Although friends said that Gomes could never be limited to one part of his identity, such as his homosexuality, he did speak on the issue when his voice was most needed.
Gomes moved the audience to tears and wept himself as he delivered a sermon in 1998 after the horrific death of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man who was tortured and left to die tied to a fence in Montana, according to Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin.
Gomes stood in the spotlight in 2004 when he spoke before a crowd in the Massachusetts State House to advocate for gay marriage.
“The way to the future is always paved by extending, not restricting, liberties,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Boston Globe that year. “To extend the civil right of marriage to homosexuals will ... permit a whole class of persons both to benefit from a valuable yet vulnerable institution.”
But Gomes’ advocacy extended beyond issues of gay rights.
When the U.S. was on the verge of invading Iraq in 2003, Gomes stood in Forbes Plaza and exclaimed that the U.S. should not go to war, Austin recalled.
His outreach extended to students, who often sought his guidance in personal affairs.
Once, a student approached Gomes for advice after his parents committed suicide on separate occasions. In another instance, a student came to him for support after a friend at the College had been murdered in a fight in Boston.
“That was the worst tragedy I had ever experienced in my life,” said Robert Sackstein ’77, the student whose friend had been killed and who is now a professor at the Medical School. “He just so compassionately guided my recovery. He really pulled me through.”
Those close to him said that Gomes’ door was always open to students and that when they walked into his office he always took the time to steer them in the right direction.
“When he talked to a student, he or she would think he was the only person on this whole earth,” Randolph said.
RELIGION AT HARVARD
A skilled preacher, Gomes was a master at the art of the pause, Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz said.
“What made him extraordinary was his ability to synthesize the gospel or the text in such a way that was both meaningful and relevant and memorable,” Katz said. “I’ve never seen a greater extemporaneous speaker all of my life.”
His powerful Sunday sermons helped maintain a religious presence at Harvard, while interest in churches diminished at other universities.
When Gomes was appointed the Pusey minister at Memorial Church in 1974, religion’s popularity across the United States was at a low point, especially on college campuses, said Jonathan C. Page ’02, a former Epps fellow.
At the time, Harvard, as an institution, was known for its lack of religious fervor, Page said. Gomes wanted to change that.
He insisted that religion be an option for undergraduates on campus by creating an atmosphere open to the practice of religion and supporting other religious groups as well.
During his tenure, Gomes turned Memorial Church into a center of religious and student life, a place where people of different religious convictions could feel welcome and practice under the same roof.
“He left an institutional legacy in that fact that Memorial Church has always been an important centerpiece of Harvard’s culture institutionally,” McCarthy said, “but it serves a broader public and a broader world.”
McCarthy added that this was no small feat in an age when religious debates were often “so violent and so vicious.” Gomes would ensure that religion continues to exist at Harvard in the long run.
His enthusiasm for religion at Harvard carried over into the class he taught about preaching, a course in which he sought to pass on his talent for oratory.
Gomes would tell his students to seek the diamond instead of the string of pearls—to find one thing worth saying and to say it multiple times.
“Love—not the romantic sense of love but the sense of unconditional love that we receive from God—should be the center of what we do and who we are,” Katz said was one of Gomes’ most important lessons.
Katz said that Gomes believed anyone who comes to Harvard should feel like they have something to contribute to the Harvard tradition—they can come here and feel like Harvard belongs to them, sharing a love of Harvard through the love of God.
“The love that we receive is a gift. It’s great. We don’t have to do anything to earn it,” Katz said. “God’s gift to us is this unconditional love.”
Whether it be for the student who had lost a friend, a young man in need of a role model, or each new crop of incoming freshmen, Gomes, too, possessed an unconditional love. It could be heard in his voice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Julia V. Mitelman ’13 had her first encounter with computer science at Harvard watching David J. Malan ’99 rip a phonebook in half. He was explaining binary search before a packed audience in Sanders Theatre.
“I knew right away that I had to take the course,” says Mitelman, who has since decided to declare computer science as a secondary field.
Though only 10 to 15 percent of total enrollees are actual CS concentrators, Computer Science 50 has become an increasingly popular course at Harvard, with more than 525 students enrolled in the class last fall.
“Students are drawn to CS for all sorts of reasons,” writes Malan, instructor of the popular programming course, in an email. “Some want to program, some want to build things, some want to start companies, and some simply want to understand the increasingly technological world around them.”
Students and professors alike say that the image of the computer scientist has changed along with the growing popularity of the field.
“There is this general sense that [CS] is not a private club for super-geeks,” says former Harvard Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has taught computer science at Harvard since 1974.
A REVOLUTIONARY COURSE
While the popularity of successful web startups such as Facebook and Google have piqued a general interest in CS, students and faculty members say that it is the introductory programming course, CS50, that has kept students excited about CS at Harvard.
“At Harvard, the person who gets the credit is David Malan,” Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 says. “He turned CS50 into a class with a real community.”
According to Seltzer, “getting people in the door” has been the biggest hurdle to promoting student interest in CS. In recent years, Malan says, he has worked hard to dispel misconceived stereotypes and a general fear of quantitative subjects like coding—turning to theatrics like ripping the phonebook to encourage students to stick with the course.
“An overarching goal of CS50 is to get students excited about a field that, for most of them, is entirely new,” Malan writes in an email.
Malan says he believes his course creates an atmosphere in which students can “feel comfortable stepping into the classroom” and “feel part of something special”—particularly for those learning programming for the first time. Students say that the unique “CS50 culture,” together with the collaborative environment, contributes to the special learning experience that the course strives to deliver.
The growth of CS50 reflects the success of Harvard’s computer science program’s ongoing mission to popularize the field by expanding outreach.
“When we grew CS about 10 years ago, the faculty themselves proposed that CS at Harvard should be different in that it should not only have excellence in computer science, but a strong outreach component,” former School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti says.
He added that computer science will become “a discipline in which we would connect at society in large,” a goal that aligns with the liberal arts mission of the College.
The recent rise in female CS concentrators is another development that attests to the success of their accomplishments, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith.
“As a CS faculty member, it’s great to hear that more students are interested in computer science,” Smith says. He adds that the department is “pleased that the concentration is seeing a surge in this area” and that administrators and faculty members have successfully developed CS “as a concentration that appeals to women.”
‘A HOT, COOL THING’
Key to the CS50’s popularity is the final project component, an exercise that enables students to develop their own web or mobile apps. Past projects, such as “I Saw You Harvard” and “Rover”—a mobile app that updates users on events, news, and deals around Harvard—have either won entrepreneurship competitions like the College’s four-year-old i3 Innovation Challenge or become enormously popular among the undergraduate community.
“A lot of people think [CS] is a hot, cool thing and they see the financial potential,” CS concentrator David A. Kosslyn ’11 says.
Kosslyn, who has initiated several web startups to date, co-founded Hack Harvard—a January Term program that aims to help students further develop their CS50 apps.
Kosslyn says he believes Hack Harvard and the student-initiated Hack Nights—weekly gatherings that extend Hack Harvard into the semester—have been instrumental to “fostering [a] community” that is similar to the experience that students enjoy from CS50.
Many students are interested in web development, whether it is through a non-profit project or a for-profit enterprise. History and Science concentrator Melissa C. Oppenheim ’12 serves as co-president of the Digital Literacy Project or “DigLit,” a web non-profit that promotes computer and internet access around the world. She says that technology non-profits like hers can use web platforms to help low-income communities.
“Over the last 10 years, the internet has become more ubiquitous,” Oppenheim says, adding that the success behind many web and mobile startups is that they are “accessible to large number of people.”
DigLit, which won i3 last year, is also one of several entrepreneurial enterprises that have been supported by the Undergraduate Council, which also endorsed Hack Harvard.
TALK OF THE TOWN
The popularity of computer science extends beyond CS concentrators.
Thomas Torello, lecturer on Molecular and Cellular Biology who advises about 200 students concentrating in MCB and Chemical and Physical Biology, estimates that between 10 and 15 percent of his advisees have taken CS50 to fulfill one of their concentration requirements.
“CS50 is a great course and I encourage it for students interested in programming, and in particular for students whose thesis research could benefit from it,” Torello says, adding that the problem solving and programming skills taught in the course help many students to write algorithms to analyze data.
Statistics concentrator Liyun Jin ’12, who is also an inactive Crimson editor, took CS50 in the fall after watching a video of Malan at Harvard Thinks Big last year and seeing the course occasionally mentioned on Harvard FML in chatter like: “My roommate will not shut [up] about CS50. It’s driving me nuts, and I’m not even in the class. FML”
Jin says her father, who is a software engineer, encouraged her to learn computer science because “programming is a useful skill to have when you’re finding jobs.”
Planning for a future in finance, she says having the knowledge of Javascript or HTML will look impressive on a resume.
“It really captures your interviewer’s attention,” she says.
Mitelman says she sat in on that first CS50 class because she thought computers were cool.
“I wanted to empower myself rather than just appreciate computers,” she says.
Mitelman attributes the course’s success to Malan’s teaching style, saying that he made the class approachable to even those who had no prior experience in computer science.
Malan says that CS50 is not an exclusive environment, adding that 77 percent of students enrolled in the class last fall had no prior experience in coding.
“We have also tried to create an experience for students whereby they feel part of something special, an incredibly immersive experience after which they feel quite proud of what they’ve accomplished,” Malan says.
“It opened a lot of doors and gave me a lot of opportunities,” Mitelman says. “CS50 has changed my attitude towards my future.”
This summer, she will be interning at Microsoft.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A crack on the wall to the right of the door and the presence of a boarded fireplace—a long-unused relic from the past—speak to the age of one dorm room in Old Quincy.
The former occupant of the room—Anna R. Veverica ’13—says that she never had a problem with allergies until she began living in her room in Old Quincy, rumored to have a problem with mold.
During the first few weeks of the year, Veverica regularly noticed cockroaches throughout her two-person suite originally built to be a single.
When she approached someone working in the Building Manager’s office about the bug infestation, he told her the problem was not uncommon.
“He promised that once people started using the rooms and the showers, all the cockroaches would go away,” Veverica says, and according to her, after a week or so, they were gone.
But the physical problems with the room remained. The small size of the bedroom forced Veverica and her roommate to put one bed in what was meant to be a common room, creating the “walk-through” style rooming arrangement often criticized by students and administrators alike.
Veverica says that although she and her roommate coped with the setup—which had her roommate walking through Veverica’s bedroom to reach their in-suite bathroom—she knows friends whose sleep schedule was regularly interrupted by a rowdy roommate.
Come 2013, when the first stage of a series of renovations across the Houses is complete, gone will be the walk-through room setup and cramped quarters that plague so many inhabitants of Old Quincy.
The renovated building will boast a number of new amenities, like an outdoor terrace, two elevators, and a “multipurpose” room in the basement well-suited for events ranging from meetings to House activities to study sessions.
Though the administration has made no explicit promises to remove the roaches, it does say that the renovation of Old Quincy—slated to begin shortly after Commencement in 2012—will drastically improve the quality of life of an Old Quincy resident.
The College has termed Old Quincy a “test project,” meant to help implement the College’s plans in the other Houses.
Although Harvard announced its ambitious plans to renovate the 12 residential Houses in April 2008, the College remained silent on the nature and scope of renovations until recently.
But now that the College has announced a swing space to house displaced students and has released floor plans that offer some image of a final product, the question becomes—what will the renovations of Old Quincy mean for the other 11 Houses?
A TEST PROJECT
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith says that the plans for Old Quincy were created with an eye towards the ability to replicate them on a larger scale.
The plans for Old Quincy have been modeled in Lowell House, one of the oldest of the residential Houses, Smith says.
New designs like the hybrid horizontal-vertical entryway setup—characterized by horizontal hallways connecting vertical entryways—can be translated to larger scale plans, according to Smith.
But he says that although many aspects of Old Quincy are indicative of future renovations, the building lacks things like a dining hall, a Master’s residence, and junior and senior common rooms that will need to be addressed when the College tackles entire Houses.
Quincy has two separate buildings—one old and one new—which allows contractors to dive into construction while leaving the majority of the House relatively untouched.
Administrators plan to continue renovating Houses at least one building at a time. For some Houses that exist in a single building, like Lowell and Eliot, the entire House population will likely need to be relocated so that they can be renovated.
“Honestly we would prefer to do them all together,” Smith says of renovating portions of a House at a time. “It disrupts the House to do half of it.”
Smith says that the three Harvard-owned apartment buildings designated as swing space for the renovations of Old Quincy—Hampden Hall, Fairfax Hall, and Ridgely Hall—are a temporary fix to finding a temporary home for students displaced by renovations.
Ultimately, Smith says, Harvard will have to create a swing space. But whether Harvard will construct a new building or designate existing space for that purpose remains undetermined.
THE VERTICAL ENTRYWAY
One of the most drastic changes to the setup of Old Quincy, touted by administrators as benefiting House and student life, is the elimination of the traditional vertical entryway.
While the physical location of the staircases will remain the same, entryways will be connected by horizontal hallways.
Students interviewed for this article were critical of the traditional vertical entryway—a common setup in nine of the residential Houses.
“I think it is not conducive to social life within your dorm,” Robert M. Hero ’13 says of the current setup. “There is something about walking up and down stairs that is so much more unappealing than walking across the hall.”
Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis says that the horizontal hallway setup—common to Pfoho—promotes a strong sense of community in the House.
“They famously said that part of the renovation was so that any student in Pfoho House could get to anywhere from anywhere else in their pajamas or less,” Christakis says, in reference to a statement attributed to former House Master J. Woodland Hastings when renovations connected the House’s formerly separate buildings.
RE-ENVISIONING HOUSE RENEWAL
Although Smith says that the Neo-Georgian Houses—Adams, Cabot, Dunster, Eliot, Kirkland, Winthrop, and portions of Leverett and Quincy—were always to be the first priorities of House renewal, House Masters say that the financial crisis may have affected the order in which Harvard renovates the Houses.
According to House Masters, an unprecedented 27.3 percent loss in the University’s endowment and the accompanying FAS budget cuts may have caused Harvard to focus on more small-scale projects like Old Quincy.
Originally the College closely examined larger Houses like Lowell and Dunster, the oldest of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses, according to Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck.
House Masters say that they think Old Leverett, similar in structure to Old Quincy, will likely be the next House on tap to be renewed.
Old Quincy was a part of Leverett House until the 1960s, when the construction of Leverett Towers and the rest of Quincy House resulted in the two being split into separate Houses.
When asked if Old Leverett would be renovated next, Smith declined to answer the question.
“What wonderful speculation,” he said with a smile. “Sounds good to me.” Smith added that the final decision about which House to renovate next had not yet been made.
MORE THAN A BUILDING
House Masters say that the impending renovations are meant to do much more than just renew the physical components of the Houses. They are meant to reinvigorate House life as well.
“When you think about House renewal, it also means thinking about the renewal of the community. What is it that is really right about the House? What works and is good for students? What draws them into a community and enables them to express themselves and allows them to flourish?” Eck says.
Christakis—who calls House life “a key part of the student experience”—says he is proud of the improvements he has made to House community with the limited resources available to Houses prior to renovations
Walking through the hallways of his House, he spoke of House-specific innovations like the creation of a “Happy Room” and the Pforums, a speech series that brings important speakers directly to the home of undergraduates.
“When we talk about House renewal we’re not just talking about the physical plan,” Christakis says. “We’re thinking about how to position resources: money, people, advising resources, all these things–in the Houses so that the students have a very stimulating experience.”
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke says that although House renewal should result in every student having the same standard of housing quality, the project is not meant to destroy the “individual character” of the Houses.
“The goal is to make it better,” Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 says. “Yet not take away those things that current occupants and old alumni mention.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shivering in sub-freezing temperatures and holding their high-heels in hand, women in short dresses and long black coats stand outside the door to the Owl.
These women are not waiting to get into a raging party. They are at the male final club to schmooze and socialize with the sisters inside that can grant access to a culture that offers camaraderie and national connections for years to come.
Of the more than 200 women wandering the streets of Cambridge on that blistery February night, only about 150 would become active members of Harvard’s burgeoning sorority scene—an aspect of Harvard social life, that, along with fraternities, has in recent years expanded at a record-setting pace.
The Harvard administration has refused to recognize sororities, fraternities, and final clubs for decades, creating a Greek life that at first glance seems less prominent than at similar schools where fraternities and sororities are not only recognized, but an integral part of college social life.
Despite Harvard’s unusual situation—in which the administration refuses to recognize what it terms a “discriminatory” culture—Harvard is part of a national trend of expanding Greek life on college campuses.
GOING GREEK
“I always knew I wanted to be in a sorority,” said Kathleen “Katie” H. Weintraub ’14, a new member of Kappa Alpha Theta.
Weintraub—whose high school friends joined sororities in college—represents a growing population of people for whom Greek life is seen as a traditional part of college life.
But the vast majority of students interviewed said that although they did not expect to rush at Harvard, they were pulled in by the promise of new friendships and the prospect of meeting a different group of people.
“With fraternities, it’s specifically about the camaraderie,” said Stephen P. Murphy ’13, who rushed and became a member of Sigma Chi this past spring. “Fraternities are more focused on the people whereas the extracurriculars are more about the interest.”
The 268 women that rushed Harvard’s three sororities this year represent the largest rush class in Harvard history, according to sorority leaders. As recently as 2008 The Crimson reported that the sorority rush class averaged about 150 people.
Fraternities also reported an increase in numbers——over 100 men attended Sigma Chi’s first rush event and about 72 signed into Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s first events, according to each fraternity’s leader. Harvard fraternity leaders declined to provide rush numbers from past years.
“We’ve really established ourselves as organizations that are worthwhile to be in,” said Tony Huang ’12, a member of Sigma Chi’s executive committee.
“[Greek life] is here to stay.”
FINAL CLUB CULTURE
Although Harvard’s Greek leaders say that increased awareness of the recruitment process may have contributed to the recent spike in rush numbers, they are unable to pin down a single reason why Greek life has increased so dramatically.
“Naturally it’s the way these things go,” said President of Harvard’s Kappa Alpha Theta chapter Ellis A. Bowen ’12. “As more people join, more people hear about it.”
For some, Greek life fills a void in a social scene described by students as catering to and dominated by male final clubs.
“There aren’t that many organizations specifically for females to get together and be a group,” said Harleen K. Gambhir ’14.
There are currently eight male final clubs on Harvard’s campus, all of which own spaces to socialize and are often the hub of the party scene on a given weekend night.
Sorority members say that amid a culture dominated by male social clubs, sororities offer a welcome escape to the bonds of sisterhood.
“There are a lot more social options for males than there are for females,” Phillip J. Morris ’12, president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, said earlier this year. “With a lot fewer female final clubs on campus, it makes more people willing to branch out to Greek organizations.”
Morris said that the fraternities face a different situation because they “compete” with male final clubs.
“Our rush process is 100 percent open and inviting to everyone,” Huang says. “That’s one of the biggest differences between us and final clubs.”
COLLEGE RECOGNITION
Harvard has not formally recognized sororities, fraternities, and final clubs since 1984 when the College revoked official status due to the gender-discriminatory recruitment policies of the social organizations.
Suzy M. Nelson, dean of student life, said that the gender discrimination issue—as well as sorority and fraternity ties to national organizations—make it unlikely that Greek life will be recognized in the near future.
“Students are free to affiliate as they choose,” Nelson said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that Harvard is going to recognize every type of club or social organization that exists.”
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that if Greek organizations want to gain official recognition, they will have to approach the administration.
“We would not initiate the contact,” she said.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Susan B. Marine said in an interview in February that sororities had approached her to discuss the possibility of recognition in the past.
At Yale—where the University officially recognizes some sororities and fraternities—Greek leaders say that their organizations benefit from the support of the administration.
President of Yale’s Panhellenic Council Stephanie Cuevas said that Yale college masters allow Greek organizations to reserve space, which makes it easier to organize events like those during the rush process.
Bowen, Theta’s president, said that she believes her sorority could benefit from “having the backing of the school” in the form of access to on-campus spaces to hold chapter meetings and host speakers.
Although Theta is looking for a space of its own—and other Greek organizations already own their own spaces—all three sororities currently hold events in the buildings of male final clubs.
But Bowen said that she does not expect the University to recognize sororities in the near future and she thinks the sorority does not need Harvard’s recognition to survive.
The president of a male final club—an organization that the administration handles in a similar manner to the Greek groups—said that he does not think recognition is necessary.
“Being officially recognized by the University just makes more of a hassle for groups,” he said.
A NATIONAL TREND
The record number of students rushing Harvard’s sororities and fraternities are not unique to the College.
Nationwide, the number of women in sororities has increased 8.4 percent from 248,120 women in 2008 to 268,983 in 2010, according to statistics compiled by the National Panhellenic Conference.
North-American Interfraternity Conference CEO Pete D. Smithhisler said that there has been an increase in fraternity membership every year since 1998.
Growing interest in Greek life has been especially pronounced among many Ivy League schools—Cornell’s Panhellenic Society announced its 12th sorority this year and, according to the Yale Daily News, the number of women rushing Yale’s sororities has doubled over the past five years.
To manage this increased interest, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, and Cornell’s panhellenic councils have all voted within the last two years to add another sorority to their campuses. Harvard and Yale are both trying to add a fourth sorority, according to Greek leaders on both campuses.
At Princeton—which, like Harvard, has three sororities—the number of women rushing sororities increased by 28 percent during the fall rush season, according to the Daily Princetonian.
Princeton, like Harvard, does not recognize sororities and fraternities, but the relationship between Greek life and Princeton’s administration could be characterized as more hostile.
According to Princeton undergraduates, the administration sends a letter home to incoming freshmen actively discouraging them from joining sororities and fraternities.
Kelsey A. Platt, the president of Princeton’s Panhellenic Council, wrote in an email that she hopes to see the relationships between Princeton and Greeks improve in the future and that if the number of women rushing the school’s sororities continues to increase, the Council will likely look into adding another sorority in the near future.
A FOURTH SORORITY?
In 2003 Harvard’s Panhellenic Council added a third sorority—Kappa Kappa Gamma—when it decided that there were not enough sororities to accommodate the rising interest in Greek life on campus. That year, about 120 women had rushed sororities; Delta Gamma and Theta accepted only about 20 people each.
This past school year, with 268 women rushing, Kappa extended 57 bids, Theta 55, and DG about 60, according to each sorority’s leaders.
Although the number of women accepted by each sorority has grown steadily, sorority leaders have said that especially with the recent increase in numbers, the creation of a fourth sorority may be on the horizon.
But despite the growing interest in Greek life, House Masters said that students should focus their energies on improving House communities, rather than creating another sorority.
“I’m always suspicious of a club that builds itself on gendered exclusivity,” Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana said. “It’s so much easier to hang out with people who remind you of your favorite person—yourself—than it is to figure out how to create an organic real community that has strength in its diversity.”
When asked if she thought Harvard should add a fourth sorority, Cabot House Master Stephanie Khurana—who was president of Cornell’s Panhellenic Council as an undergraduate and a member of Cornell’s Fraternity and Sorority Advisory Council as an alumnae—had a simple answer.
“No.”
Organic relationships can be formed within one’s House, the Khuranas argue, thus making Greek organizations unnecessary.
National Panhellenic Council Northeast Advisor Patricia Gesell wrote in an email that the process for adding a sorority is complicated and centers on demonstrating that another sorority would improve the quality of Greek life on that campus.
Recently sorority presidents at Harvard declined to comment on the status of plans for a fourth sorority.
University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, and Cornell have all voted recently to add another sorority to their campuses.
“The record number of girls demonstrates that there’s definitely a demand for sorority life on campus,” Kappa President Anna S. He ’12 said in February. “We want a fourth sorority on campus and we’re going to push for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a visitor climbs the stairs out of the T station or a Harvard freshman exits the Yard, he or she enters what is called “the heart of Harvard Square.” Two decades ago, the visible area was lined with local, independent stores.
Over the years, the central locations of the Square have become dominated by national chains. In recent months, two national corporations—Pinkberry and Starbucks—opened in one of the oldest buildings in Harvard Square.
Traveling further down Mass. Ave., the street that was once home to several small retail stores has transformed into a line filled with banks and nationally owned chains. An old time business, Bob Slate—a stationary store—closed its doors in March, but the location will soon be filled by a chain panini restaurant, Panera Bread.
Yet hidden between the nationally-recognized names reside independent businesses that hold on to what was once the foundation of Harvard Square. These small shops stay true to their niches to provide unique services to the community while trying to survive in a world of economic shifts and changing trends.
THE CHANGING FACE
Even before the establishment of Harvard University, the Square existed as an area of local businesses to serve the needs of 17th century community members. Since then, Harvard Square has developed as one of the most popular destinations in Massachusetts.
The Harvard Square Business Association, which has served the community for over 100 years, has tracked data on Square business for the past decade.
HSBA Executive Director Denise A. Jillson says that over that time, there has been a shift from retail to more restaurants and eateries in the Square. According to the HSBA, there are 128 retail establishments and 95 restaurants.
The number of locally-owned independent businesses has fluctuated between 72 to 80 percent and is currently 78.1 percent, according to Jillson.
“One of the causes for the perception [of more nationals] is they are typically located in the most visible real estate,” Jillson says. “They can pay higher rents. It’s not a growing trend here. It’s been a reality for a long time.”
The high cost of rent has also forced many residents of the Square to move, says Paul J. Macdonald, the owner of Leavitt & Peirce—a tobacconist that has been in the Square for 178 years. This shift has changed the face of the Square.
“The community has definitely changed. It’s less of a neighborhood,” says Bill E. Bartley, the general manager of Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage.
Bartley, whose father Joseph Bartley founded the restaurant in 1961, recalls growing up on Mass. Ave. and learning from the many local business owners on the street.
The business world has seen a change in the past decade due to the emergence of the Internet and online shopping, according to Richard J. Diamond, the owner of Diamond Group—a commercial brokerage and advisory company. These factors can force both independent and national businesses to fail. Abercrombie & Fitch—a national men and women’s apparel store—was located at 6 JFK St, but it closed in 2004 to be replaced by Citizens Bank.
“What happens is some big chains come in and realize they can’t do business here. They close and the small mom and pops continue to flourish,” Diamond says.
Christos Soillis, the owner of Felix Shoe Repairs, says a successful old business survives by “doing the best job you can do.”
“Do the right thing and they will find out and come to you,” Soillis says.
Macdonald says staying true to its niche of gifts, games, and tobacco has allowed Leavitt & Peirce to be a “torchbearer” for the old Harvard Square.
TUCKED IN THE CORNERS
As he stood outside the soon-to-be location of his first frozen yogurt shop, Matthew A. Wallace, the co-owner of Berryline, panicked as he counted only 20 people walking by in four hours. Without foot traffic, he feared customers would never find out about his business.
Wallace’s fears are emblematic of a problem faced by many small businesses, which often cannot afford to pay the high rents of prime real estate locations that receive the most foot traffic.
But the Berryline location has nonetheless become popular among the Harvard Square community.
“We were totally bootstrapping it, and the students really embraced it,” Wallace says. “People identified with us.”
Nhon T. Ma, the owner of Zinneken’s—a Belgian waffle shop set to open in August—also secured a space in the back corner of the Square, above Berryline. Ma and Wallace both hope that the location will become more of a destination due to the opening of this new business.
Otto Pizza is located at the center of the Square but faces size limitations at only 280 square feet.
“People said you’ll never get that space. That’s going to a national, but not many other food places can work in the size limitations,” says Anthony W. Allen, the pizza place’s co-owner.
Some businesses have been pushed to less prominent sites. Schoenhof’s—a foreign-language bookstore—opened in 1856 and used to reside on Mass. Ave. But it moved to 76 Mount Auburn St. in 1983 and has stayed there since.
“A lot of people think the Square’s being taken over by chains, but there are lots of independents buried between them,” says Ayr M. Muir, owner and founder of the Holyoke Street restaurant Clover.
A PLACE FOR INNOVATION
Harvard Square has served as one of the first locations for what are now regional or national businesses, including Bertucci’s and Au Bon Pain, and national businesses continue to use the area as a testing ground for new projects like Starbucks’ recently opened two-story location.
“We have customers who can barely see over the counter and people in their 70s,” says Allen.
Clover opened its first location in the fall of 2010 on Holyoke Street after the success of its food trucks at the MIT campus.
“I thought this would be a great place for us to test ourselves,” Muir says.
Even established businesses in the Square have used it to test new products and concepts. Au Bon Pain remodeled its location to a marketplace design in January. After the positive feedback from the remodelling, the company is using the prototype to overhaul the entire chain, according to CEO Susan A. Morelli.
Starbucks’ third location in Harvard Square incorporates an innovative two floor design. As a center for coffee enthusiasts, General Manager C. Shane Sykes believes Harvard Square provides a perfect location.
“We truly believe that being able to deliver our coffee here and have a room on the second floor gives a customers a chance to slow down and appreciate the coffee,” Sykes says.
This year has seen the addition of national and small businesses and will continue to transform with the opening of Zinneken’s. While the owners are from Belgium, they believed Harvard Square to be a great location due to the traffic flow and the age spectrum of customers.
“I also think people are looking for something different in the Square,” Ma says.
CONTROL OF THE LANDLORDS
Many property owners with different goals and visions for the Square lease spaces to the 365 businesses currently open in the Square.
Harvard University leases spaces to 36 businesses, including Mr. Bartley’s, Leavitt & Peirce and the Globe Corner Bookstore.
“Our focus is always on small businesses with unique offerings,” says Lisa Hogarty, the vice president for campus services at Harvard. “We really don’t talk to national retailers ever.”
Soillis says he appreciates Harvard for the support they have given him and his business.
The University is not the only property owner of many independent businesses. John P. DiGiovanni, the president of Trinity Property Management and the president of the HSBA board, leases property for Fire & Ice, Dado Tea, several places in The Garage Mall, and other locations throughout the Square.
DiGiovanni’s company considers each shop owner’s business plan, offering for the Square, and strength before accepting their offer.
“It isn’t always the case for the highest bidder. In the long term, it’s better to have a cafe than a phone store,” DiGiovanni says.
The University also considers the experience of the business. Hogarty says that the most recent tenants—Clover and Al’s Harvard Square Cafe—were recognized for the success of their other locations.
The HSBA board meetings serve as a venue for property owners and other business owners to advocate for either independent or national business, or even a combination of the two.
Hogarty says that Harvard, as a member of the HSBA, urges other property owners to look to small businesses to preserve the uniqueness of the Square.
But not all landlords in the Square have a strict policy of leasing to only independent businesses. Cambridge Savings Bank leases the historic building at 1380 Mass. Ave., which is now home to Pinkberry and Starbucks.
Cambridge Savings Bank declined to comment on their leasing policies.
PART OF THE COMMUNITY
Some local business owners emphasize the importance of keeping square stores mostly independently owned, but others note that in order for the community to remain vibrant, it is important to have a mixture of business models.
“It’s good to sprinkle national tenants,” says Thomas J. Brush, the co-owner of Felipe’s and Flat Patties, noting an independent business would likely not be able to afford a space as large as the one that Anthropologie currently occupies at 48 Brattle St.
Representatives of national corporations are also allowed to be members of the HSBA and several are, including the general managers of Pinkberry and the new Starbucks. Both of their managers are also Cambridge residents and have long relationships with the Square.
“While we have a national brand, we have a local franchise,” says Trippe J. Lonian, the Pinkberry area developer for New England.
These companies have looked to become a part of the neighborhood through charity and community events.
Regardless of their business model, Harvard Square store and restaurant owners agree that in order to survive they must serve the needs of the community.
According Marley J. Brush, co-owner of Crema Cafe, about 60 percent of the restaurant’s customers are regulars.
Pinnocchio’s may be farther away from the center of the Square than other pizzerias, but it is successful due to its quality and regular customer base, says owner Adam Dicenso.
But local business people say they also rely on the Square being a unique attraction in Cambridge, a quality they fear may fade with a shift towards more restaurants and national companies.
“If it becomes an outdoor strip mall like Faneuil Hall, what’s the difference?” Brush says. “There wouldn’t be anything new to discover.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Media and public attention centered on the demonstrations that swept the Middle East in the past months, which toppled two regimes and inspired hope for democratic change across the region.
But at the College, students have had limited opportunities to take up the recent upheaval on an academic level.
This spring, however, the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations announced the first undergraduate degree offering focusing exclusively on the modern Middle East—as a secondary field.
The gap in contemporary Middle East studies became evident in the wake of the September 11 attacks, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences struggled to accommodate the spike in student interest. At the time, Harvard committed itself to taking bolder steps to meet its shortcomings in course offerings.
But some professors say that more than ten years later the College is still ill-equipped to offer a comprehensive undergraduate education on the modern Middle East.
“The University has been trying to increase Middle East studies since 9/11,” says NELC Director of Modern Languages William E. Granara. “It hasn’t been that successful because it hasn’t made the best effort possible.”
TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING
Professors say that the recent upheaval has only served to renew the rising student interest in the contemporary Middle East that dates back to the September 11 attacks.
At the time, professors recognized that the faculty resources and course offerings did not match student demand.
“For the last ten years, there has been a lot of interest,” says Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of NELC. He says that there was a spike in Arabic-language course enrollment in the years following the attacks.
But the school failed to retain some experts in the field and was slow in creating an academic path for undergraduates interested in studying the modern Middle East.
Last fall, FAS brought in Malika Zeghal, a scholar in contemporary Islam, in an effort to remedy curriculum gaps.
But Granara says that the appointment serves immediate needs but is not indicative of a larger commitment on behalf of the University to hire scholars specializing in contemporary Middle East studies. He says that potential positions will instead likely be allotted to openings in the study of other regions.
“They may be trying to replace professors, but they are not adding,” he says. “Although it is a wonderful appointment, in light of recent events, and in light of student demand, one appointment is unsatisfactory.”
FINDING THE TALENT
The Government Department has not had a Middle East expert in its ranks since visiting Professor Emad Shahin left in 2009, and has not had a tenured position in the field since Nadav Safran retired about 20 years ago.
The department has approached the study of the region through a theoretical lens that draws upon its experts in fields like democratization and political movements.
Government Professor Steven R. Levitsky, a comparative political scientist, says that he will include material on the contemporary Middle East in his popular course, Government 20: “Introduction to Comparative Politics.”
“Gov 20 now includes a lecture on the Iranian revolution, a lecture on the prospects for democratization in post-Hussein Iraq, half a lecture on authoritarian stability in the Middle East, and part of a lecture on consociationalism in Lebanon,” he says. “There will be additional material on democratization in the Middle East.”
But he says that a Middle East expert would be an important addition to the department.
“Our inability in [the Government Department] to hire a Middle East expert has been a real problem,” he says.
Some professors say that the focus on theoretical studies does not offer a comprehensive understanding of the issue, particularly for undergraduates.
“If you want people to be theoretically informed, that’s fine,” Granara says. “Undergraduates need to learn the nuts and bolts of modern Arab politics, and they won’t necessarily find that in theory.”
Eva R. Bellin ’80 was assistant professor of government at Harvard before she accepted a position at Hunter College in 2003. Although hailed as an “expert” of contemporary Middle East studies by former colleagues at Harvard, Bellin says that she left because she did not expect to be offered tenure at the University.
“To be hired in a tenured position at Harvard you have to be an undisputed star in your discipline,” says Bellin, now a professor at Brandeis University.
Political scientists who study the contemporary Middle East face obstacles that “make it difficult to put together a portfolio that would establish the scholar as an undisputed star,” she says.
In addition to the challenging research environment and the difficulty of the Arabic language, Bellin notes that these scholars must be able to consider various methodologies within an already specialized discipline.
“Unfortunately the field of political science is divided along political and methodological grounds and this makes it doubly hard to build consensus around what constitutes excellent scholarship,” Bellin says.
MEETING UNDERGRAD DEMAND
This May, NELC announced that it would offer a Middle East Studies secondary field as an experiment and potential precursor to a new concentration in the fall. Professors hope that the new secondary concentration will accommodate the growing undergraduate interest in the region.
As chair of NELC, Asani says that he has prioritized building an undergraduate concentration on the contemporary Middle East. He said in an email to The Crimson that while the University has served as a “leading center for Middle East studies since the 1950s,” it lacks undergraduate opportunities. “NELC is attempting to expand its coverage of the modern periods,” he explains.
In the past, NELC has focused on the ancient Middle East and relied on faculty in other departments to teach topics related to the modern region, he says.
Asani says he is optimistic that the department will offer a full concentration by next year.
Although Asani says the development of a secondary field was not inspired by the recent political unrest, the secondary may help accommodate the renewed interest in the region. He says that Zeghal’s hiring—bringing her from the University of Chicago’s Divinity School—has served as “an extra impetus” for constructing the undergraduate path that focuses on the region.
But professors say FAS still lacks senior faculty members in modern Middle East politics, particularly in the Government Department.
“We have tried to hire [contemporary Middle East professors], but thus far without success,” Levitsky says. “It is really a shame.”
TEACHING THE ARAB SPRING
As NELC continues to develop its undergraduate offerings, individual faculty members across FAS say that the recent Arab upheaval will inevitably guide their course curricula.
Government Professor Grzegorz Ekiert says he spent the “entire semester discussing revolts in the region” in his new course, Government 1115: “Protests and Politics in Comparative Perspective.”
History professor Roy P. Mottahedeh ’60, chair of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies program, notes that his “bread and butter teaching is before the 1500s.” But he says even he plans to alter his course on Islamic political thought to reflect the recent protests.
“We are thinking about what is happening in the broader world,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith says. “We are always evaluating what to provide in our college curriculum.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How can a research university address problems of health-care delivery, especially for the poor or otherwise vulnerable? The possibilities are, as we say in a clinical lab when counting blood cells, “TNTC”—too numerous to count. But for those who wish to build robust academic programs in global health, there are three chief categories of action: research, training, and service. This triad is familiar to anyone who works in a teaching hospital. However, problems as significant as health-care delivery cannot be solved by medical schools, teaching hospitals, or schools of public health alone. All parts of the University—from undergraduates to emeriti, the college to the professional schools, and the alumni to administration—have something to offer. Harvard’s global health agenda is ambitious, and its time has come.
That agenda has been transformed in recent years, as I know from personal experience. In the fall of 1984, newly arrived to Harvard Medical School after a year volunteering in a rudimentary clinic in central Haiti, I knew I wanted to work in what was then called “international health.” Even then, it was obvious that Haiti needed not only improved infrastructure and personnel but also new ways of delivering services. With the help of friends, the NGO Partners In Health was founded to help build delivery systems in Haiti and elsewhere. But what sort of training should someone with my interests pursue here at Harvard? It wasn’t a propitious time: there was not, at one of the world’s best medical schools, a formal training track for someone with such interests, nor were there many students in my class with similar aspirations.
Much has changed since then. Many of our small cohort of students did pursue careers in “global health equity,” the next and better iteration of international health. We had a lot of help along the way, but not because there were a plethora of career ladders in global health. I studied medical anthropology and trained in infectious disease, but these were not global health training programs. In fact, there were no such programs, in large part because global health is not a discipline or a field but rather a collection of problems.
These problems—which range from the grotesque absence of basic services for the world’s bottom billion to the poor quality of delivery of care in some more affluent nations—are increasingly recognized for what they are: a rebuke to our unequal world and a source of unnecessary suffering and social instability. This is obvious to poor families facing catastrophic illness, the leading cause of destitution in many nations; it is recognized by the citizens and leaders of countries still struggling to break the cycle of poverty and disease.
I am glad to see that U.S. research universities, too, now all seem to boast programs in global health. But claiming to have programs in global health is not the same thing as creating programs that can make a difference to populations facing poverty and ill health; nor is that the same as having career pathways and sound training programs, not just for our own students and faculty, but for students and colleagues in the places we work. Harvard needs to accompany its students and faculty and alumni by tackling the big three problems—building sound platforms for research, training, and service delivery—with all of the resources at our disposal.
This should be easier at Harvard than at any other American university for at least three reasons. First, because so many faculty are already working on the health problems that plague the most vulnerable in countries rich, poor, and in between. Second, because so many of our students and trainees wish to work in this arena, which wasn’t true not long ago. And third, because the University’s leadership, from President to Provost (both outgoing and incoming are doctors interested in global health) to Deans, all believe in moving global health forward as a serious academic enterprise.
How do we advance the research agenda when it must reach from bench science to the social sciences and humanities and every field in between? Sue Goldie, who leads the Harvard Global Health Institute, has worked with others to compile a directory of what’s going on here already, and it’s a long and impressive list. Both volume and quality will continue to increase with even a modicum of support, and will increase more rapidly with greater investments and support for junior faculty seeking to make global health the focus on their work rather than a hobby.
Tackling the training challenges in an equitable way is a thornier problem. According to the Consortium of Universities for Global Health, 70 American universities have formal academic programs in global health, almost all of them developed within the last several years; of the 131 U.S. medical schools, over a hundred have programs in global health. But, again, the “hobby” approach differs from true accompaniment. We’ve started, with the help of undergraduates and Partners In Health sites in Africa, a global health study abroad program (GEO-Scholars), and similar programs are flourishing at the Medical School. Well-mentored opportunities are rarest in the poorest countries—the places to which most students are drawn.
Funding post-graduate medical education is a much more resource-intensive affair. Almost a decade ago, we started the country’s first residency in internal medicine and global health equity, with the expectation that private philanthropy and support from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital would be followed by support from public sources: global health initiatives like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief have proven their worth and should complemented with rigorous training and research. But the training of U.S. doctors does not include public financing of their training when outside the United States, or for that matter in poor regions outside the teaching hospital but within the borders of the country. We still don’t have federal support for residency programs in global health. Training specialists in medicine—fellows in cardiology, say, or the surgical specialties—also takes a lot of resources, and these typically come from the federal government in the form of large training grants. But federal training grants in global health, though cheered by many leaders and perhaps right around the corner, are stalled by the financial crisis.
And every training program at Harvard should be “mirrored” by similar commitments to help our host countries address their own training needs, since in each of these countries there are talented students and trainees who would also like to devote themselves to improving the health of their fellow citizens. Consider Botswana (which has no school of public health), Rwanda (not a single oncologist but plenty of cancer), Haiti (which lost its nursing and medical schools to a devastating earthquake) and Lesotho (which doesn’t have a single medical school but does have enormous need for physicians and plenty of talented young people). “Aid” to people in such countries—and I’ve just mentioned a few in which Harvard students and faculty work—cannot consist only of exporting our research and our training. This model of assistance has been long discredited.
A better term for what Harvard might do to help build a proper field of global health is “accompaniment.” To accompany someone is to go somewhere with him or her, to break bread together, to be present on a journey with a beginning and an end. As at a commencement like the one we celebrate this week, we’re not always sure where the beginning and end might be. In this accompaniment, America’s universities can line up with many worthy partners. For example, the Clinton Health Access Initiative is advancing an ambitious program to allow faculty members from a half dozen American universities to support medical training in Rwanda; similar efforts are needed in dozens of countries.
Research and training in global health are for naught if they fail to improve the delivery of health services or if we fail to train, and learn from, our peers and partners. The word “global” shouldn’t deceive us: Boston is on the globe, too, and some people in the United States suffer from deficiencies in infrastructure and personnel not all that different from what I saw in rural Haiti in 1983. One thing we’ve learned in the United States is that it’s very expensive to give poor-quality health care to poor people in a rich country.
Taking global health from a hobby to a serious pursuit is well within our reach if we commit adequate resources to a series of tasks that include research, training, and improved delivery of quality care. Harvard can’t do this alone, but working with the right partners—including those laboring in places far from Cambridge—we can forge ethically sound endeavors in which we generate new knowledge while saving lives and improving the quality of many more.
Paul Farmer is the Kolokotrones University Professor, chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, chief of the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and founding director of Partners In Health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One lament in the general apprehension about the onset of digitization takes the form of “The Death of the Book.” I have received so many invitations to conferences about The Death of the Book that I think the book must be very much alive. It reminds me of a favorite joke among publishers: Question: What was the world’s first book? Answer: The Bible. Question: What was the world’s second book? Answer: The Death of the Book.
I take this joke as a symptom of something serious—confusion from so much electronic messaging and information overload that we are suffering from a collective case of false consciousness. It’s no one’s fault but everyone’s problem, because in trying to get our bearings in cyberspace, we often get things wrong; and the misconceptions spread so rapidly that they go unchallenged. Taken together, they constitute a font of proverbial non-wisdom. Five stand out:
First, “The book is dead.” Wrong: more books are produced in print each year than in the previous year. One million new titles will appear worldwide in 2011. In one day in Britain—“Super Thursday”, last October 1—800 new works were published. The latest figures for the U.S. cover only 2009, and they do not distinguish between new books and new editions of old books. But the total number, 288,355, suggests a healthy market, and the growth in 2010 and 2011 is likely to be much greater. Moreover, these figures, furnished by Bowker, do not include the explosion in the output of “non-traditional” books—a further 764,448 titles produced by self-publishing authors and “micro-niche”, print-on-demand enterprises. The production of new titles in the U.K. has increased by nearly 40 percent since 2001. The book business is booming in developing countries like China and Brazil. However it is measured, the population of books is increasing, not decreasing, and certainly not dying.
Second, “We have entered the information age.” This announcement is usually intoned solemnly as if information did not exist in other ages. But every age is an age of information, each in its own way and according to the media available at the time. No one would deny that the modes of communication are now changing rapidly, perhaps as rapidly as in Gutenberg’s day, but it is misleading to construe that change as unprecedented.
Third, “All information is now available online.” The absurdity of this claim is obvious to anyone who has ever done research in archives. Only a tiny fraction of archival material has ever been read, much less digitized.  The vast output of regulations and reports by public bodies remains largely unpublished. Most judicial decisions and legislation have made it to the web but remain inaccessible to the citizens they affect, except for those who are willing to pay. Google estimates that 129, 864, 880 different books exist in the world, and it claims to have digitized 15 million of them—or about 12 percent. How will it close the gap, while production continues to expand at a rate of a million new works a year? And how will information in non-print formats make it online en masse? Half of all films made before 1940 have vanished without a trace. What percentage of current audio-visual material will survive, even if it makes a fleeting appearance on the Internet. Despite the efforts to preserve the millions of messages exchanged by means of blogs, email, and handheld devices, most of the daily flow of information disappears. Digital texts degrade far more easily than words printed on paper. Brewster Kahle, creator of Internet Archive, calculated in 1997 that the average life of a URL was 44 days. Not only does most information not appear online, but most of the information that once did appear has probably been lost.
Fourth, “Libraries are obsolete.” Everywhere in the country librarians report that they have never had so many patrons. The 85 branch libraries of the New York Public Library system are crammed with people. They supply books, videos, and other material as always; but they also are fulfilling new functions: access to information for small businesses, help with homework and after school activities for K-12 children, and employment information for job seekers (the disappearance of want ads in printed newspapers makes the library’s online services crucial for the unemployed). Librarians are responding to the needs of their patrons in new ways, notably by guiding them through the wilderness of cyberspace to relevant and reliable digital material. Libraries never were warehouses of books. While continuing to provide books in the future, they will function as nerve centers for communicating digitized information at the neighborhood level as well as on college campuses. At Harvard, our libraries are full of readers who work simultaneously in the analog and digital realms. Widener stands as a symbol of the library’s place at the center of intellectual life in the university, and all of Harvard’s 73 libraries are now being integrated in a way that will adapt the system to the needs of the 21st century.
Fifth, “The future is digital.” True enough, but misleading. In 10, 20, or 50 years, the information environment will be overwhelmingly digital, but the prevalence of electronic communication does not mean that printed material will cease to be important. Research in the relatively new discipline of book history has demonstrated that new modes of communication do not displace old ones, at least not in the short run. Manuscript publishing actually expanded after Gutenberg and continued to thrive for the next three centuries. The radio did not destroy the newspaper; television did not kill the radio; and the Internet did not make T.V. extinct. In each case, the information environment became richer and more complex. That is what we are experiencing in this crucial phase of transition to a dominantly digital ecology.
With its 17 million volumes and extraordinary special collections, the Harvard Library is by far the largest university library in the world. Although its primary duty is to serve the students and faculty at Harvard, it is a national asset. We have a responsibility to the nation and to the entire world of learning as we realign its component parts to make a greater whole. In doing so, we will be guided by two years of intense study by various working groups, and we will steer clear of the misconceptions that could make us lose sight of our main objective—to make a great library greater and to help design the information landscape in a way that will serve the public good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard admissions officers bear a weighty responsibility—they must sift through tens of thousands of applicants and select the chosen few who will be welcomed into the 375-year-old Harvard community.
Some view the Admissions Office’s decisions with cynicism, accusing Harvard of actively working to inflate the number of students who apply and of failing to enroll the nation’s poorest students.
Others see Harvard as a leader and innovator working to diversify its applicant pool by intensifying its effort to reach out to disadvantaged high school students.
After a four-year absence, administrators announced this year the return of early admission—a program thought by some to diminish college access for lower-income students. The decision, which shook the admissions world, represents a dramatic shift in policy and offers a window into Harvard administrators’ decision-making processes.
The 2006 decision to end early action—like the move to drastically increase Harvard’s financial aid in 2004 and other initiatives before it—was meant to improve the accessibility of Harvard College for disadvantaged students.
But while Harvard administrators hoped these decisions would help to improve the College, they also meant for their efforts to pressure other universities to diversify their student bodies as well.
THE EARLY QUESTION
Five years ago Harvard announced that it would eliminate its early admission option, claiming that students of lower socioeconomic status often did not have the resources or knowledge to file an application early.
“Early admission programs tend to advantage the advantaged,” then-interim University President Derek C. Bok said at the time. “Students from more sophisticated backgrounds and affluent high schools often apply early to increase their chances of admission, while minority students and students from rural areas, other countries, and high schools with fewer resources miss out.”
But this February, the University shifted direction. The previous concerns, officials argued, had been mitigated by recruiting efforts and the strength of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, a landmark merit-based aid offering.
Furthermore, some low-income students desired the certainty of a decision early in the process, since many universities retained their early programs, Harvard officials argue.
Some admissions experts said that Harvard was correct to eliminate its early action program.
“Harvard did the right thing several years ago by trying to make the system more equitable and eliminating early action,” said Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation.
“I’m not sure why that would change dramatically over the last few years.”
Others are less certain that bringing back early admission will have a negative impact on the number of students Harvard accepts from underrepresented backgrounds.
Christopher N. Avery ’88, author of The Early Admissions Game, said that students who are admitted in early admission programs are typically more advantaged than those admitted from the regular pool.
Still, he said that eliminating the program does not necessarily increase the diversity of the applicant pool.
Harvard will continue to accept the same number of wealthy students with or without early action, said Avery, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School. But, he said, without early action, Harvard would not receive applications from some high school students who opt to apply early at other top tier institutions.
Regardless of whether Harvard made the right decision when it eliminated its early program, it is clear that Harvard failed to motivate many other universities to do the same.
“We obviously hoped that a significant number [of other institutions] would join us,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ‘67 said during an interview Friday. “Unfortunately, we did not set a trend. We are disappointed and we think it would have been have a strong statement [about early action].”
In the end, only Princeton University and the University of Virginia followed course.
“I think the goal was, ‘let’s see if we can start a revolution.’ That was a valiant effort, but it didn’t happen,” said Avery, who said he believes that the situation would be different today had other schools followed Harvard’s lead.
Since few schools moved to abandon their early admission programs, Harvard was forced to compete with schools that could offer students admission guarantees earlier in the school year.
FINANCIAL AID
While Harvard administrators failed to push other universities to eliminate their early programs, other initiatives have had more success in altering the admissions landscape.
In 2004, when the University adopted the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, Harvard was the first top university to institute an expansive financial aid program.
Today, acceptance to Harvard guarantees a full ride to applicants with families that make less than $60,000 a year. Families that earn up to $180,000 a year are expected to pay no more than 10 percent of their family income in tuition.
Harvard’s leadership on financial aid pushed many universities, competing for the same top students, to create comparable financial aid programs.
“Harvard is doing about as well as it possibly could,” said Matthew M. Chingos ’05, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Harvard has in recent memory always had pretty generous financial aid.”
When Harvard announced the introduction of its financial aid initiative, peer institutions were quick to follow suit. By 2006, Yale and Stanford had unveiled similar programs with guaranteed free tuition for lower-income students.
Now, other Ivy League schools also offer generous financial aid, and universities in England are beginning to structure financial aid offerings in the likeness of Harvard’s program, according to Fitzsimmons.
“You always hope that Harvard will be a leader not just in the size of its endowment but in actually initiating enlightened policy,” Bok said, speaking about Harvard’s admission policies.
RECRUITMENT
As Harvard continues to pursue socioeconomically diverse applicants, the Admissions Office has stepped up its recruitment efforts.
Harvard admissions officials travel the country, holding panels that Fitzsimmons said demystify the process for students who would not necessarily think of Harvard as a viable option.
Reaching out in person is important to any effort to recruit, according to Graduate School of Education Professor Emeritus Charles V. Willie, who has been critical of the lack of diversity at Harvard, particularly in the faculty.
“There needs to be more talking. I know people who would have been good people at Harvard but went elsewhere when they would have done great here,” he said.
According to Fitzsimmons, while it is obvious that not everyone who receives promotional materials can be admitted to the College, the letters are essential to reaching students who would not consider Harvard otherwise.
About 70 percent of the students who ultimately enroll at Harvard were among those sent recruitment letters, according to Fitzsimmons. He said that 90 percent of minority students at Harvard received such a letter.
But Harvard’s recruitment policies have their critics.
Earlier this month, Bloomberg News published an article that featured a number of students and high school guidance counselors criticizing Harvard for the number of promotional mailings that it sends each year.
“The overwhelming majority of students receiving these mailings will not be admitted in the end and Harvard knows this well,” Jon Reider, director of college counseling at University High School in San Francisco, said in the article. He is also quoted as calling the mailings “not honorable.”
EVOLVING
Harvard’s efforts to diversify its applicant pool have improved dramatically in the last decade, beginning with African Americans in the 1960s.
In a 1961 report that garnered national attention, Harvard Director of Admissions Wilbur J. Bender ’27 argued that students would benefit from a more diverse college.
“What I am trying to say is that a deliberate policy of one-factor selection might produce in our student body not more students of first-rate intellectual power, but fewer,” Bender said.
In the same report, Bender warned that if Harvard failed to improve its economic diversity, the school would become an antiquated university. Over the years, the College’s admission policies have evolved and Bender’s goals were realized, at least in part.
“We’re getting talent from all over America that was not even close in the classes of the 1960s,” Fitzsimmons said.
GOING FORWARD
While education experts acknowledge the improvements Harvard has made, they say there is room for growth.
“Harvard has made substantial progress on socioeconomic diversity, but still has a long way to go. It’s clear that the students eligible for Pell grants have increased,” said Kahlenberg, from The Century Foundation.
A letter sent to the New York Times by Fitzsimmons and Director of Financial Aid Sarah C. Donahue said that 16.8 percent of students at the College are eligible for Pell Grants, which are given to students in the approximate bottom half of the income spectrum.
Kahlenberg said that studies suggest that the percentage could be higher without diminishing the quality of the student population.
Fitzsimmons does not deny that there is room for progress.
“We know there are still plenty of very talented students out there from poor and modest economic backgrounds,” he said. “Just because we made progress over the past five to six years is no indication about whether we can make progress in the next five to six to seven years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my forty-nine years as a professor at Harvard, I have seen a change from the Old Harvard, a place of tradition with its prejudices, to the New Harvard, a place of prestige with its own prejudices.  What’s the difference?
At the Old Harvard there was arrogance and yet an embarrassed reluctance to admit being at Harvard, and attitude now casually and openly mocked.  A difference is that now the joke applies to Harvard women as well as Harvard men.  At the Old Harvard, this reluctance was assured arrogance trying not to be condescending; now it is truly embarrassed and apologetic, humility fighting with pride.
The pride comes from consciousness of merit and is thus a reasonable pride.  Respect for merit gives confidence that the inequalities resident in our democracy are the source of progress rather than reaction.  Call it meritocracy if you will, but it is better for us than any alternative.  This was the confidence of the Old Harvard, as it was the liberal Harvard that reigned before the Late Sixties.  It reflected an acute contradiction in our democracy between the demand for ever more equality and the progress that results from the desire to make oneself better than others by competing with them.
Now, confidence in progress has been replaced by postulation of change. Progress is achieved and can be welcomed, but change just happens and must be adjusted to.  Adjusting to change is now the unofficial motto of Harvard: mutabilitas instead of veritas. To adjust, the new Harvard must avoid adherence to any principle that does not change, even liberal principle.  Yet in fact Harvard maintains three principles:  diversity, choice, and equality.
To respect change, diversity must serve to overcome stereotypes, even as stereotypes are necessary to diversity.  How else is a Midwesterner “diverse” if he is not a hayseed? Diversity of opinion cannot be tolerated when it might hinder change.
In the same way, choice in our curriculum is displayed in a dizzying array of courses that allow students to indulge their whims and protect their leisure.  Choice is best when it does not produce devotion and leaves one’s options open.  A devoted student makes himself unready for change.  Respect for merit remains, but it yields to contemporary conventions of self-esteem in which everyone is entitled to a point of view—and, need I add, a high grade.
Equality is prized not because equality is good but because nothing is good. No standard exists by which we could understand ourselves as unequal.
These three tenets seek to abolish principle itself because adherence to it ultimately stands in the way of further change.  In practice, however, no one favors unchanging change.  Feminists at Harvard, so influential in the making of the New Harvard, oppose the idea they call “essentialism,” that there is an essential, unchanging distinction between the sexes.   To be sure that the sexes are not fixed, some of them—the early, most fearless feminists—argued that nothing is fixed.  But to achieve gender equality, it turns out to be necessary to recognize the career disadvantages of being a woman—as if woman were a fixed being.  Is a woman something fixed or something open and unlimited?  This is a question not yet answered at the New Harvard.
Through all this, one group is exempt from the demand for change:  the scientists.  To them the University is divided into science and non-science; only the former is true knowledge while the latter is likely to be mush.  However, scientists easily forget that science cannot prove that science is good, that their whole project is founded upon what is at best unscientific common sense.  They do not see that the unscientific foundation of science leaves science far short of wisdom, whether practical or theoretical. Science cannot answer the question why human beings resist science at least as strongly as they embrace it.  It cannot prove to us why knowledge is better than prejudice.
It is the job of the humanities to make non-science into something positive that could be called human in the best sense.  This crucial work, which is necessary to science and, dareI add, more difficult and more important than science, is hardly addressed in our universities.  Leading this effort, or “leading from behind,” as the phrase goes, is the humanities faculty at Harvard.  They are the ones who have established change as the principle that, for lack of anything better, can be agreed upon.  In its more thoughtful expression, that principle is known as post-modern.  What is modern is faith in science and progress, and what is post-modern is the transformation of progress into mere change.
When there is no basis for what we agree on, it becomes imperative that we agree.  The very fragility of change as a principle makes us hold on to it with insistence and tenacity.  Having nothing to conform to, we conform to conformism- hence political correctness.  Political correctness makes a moral principle of opposing, and excluding, those of us who believe in principles that do not change.   This is the atmosphere—somehow both thin and stifling—of the New Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peter Gomes wrote his sermons and lectures in a small study on the second floor of his official residence, Sparks House. It was filled floor to ceiling with books on Harvard history and a range of Biblical topics. Above his desk, in front of him as he worked, were eight framed photos of the Lowell House Senior Common Room, from among the many he kept and cherished. These annual photos were taken on the steps of the Lowell courtyard over the course of forty years.  In the earliest, from about 1972, Classicist Zeph Stewart is Master, standing front and center, and Peter is a young man with a moustache and a bow tie a few rows back. Then there are photos from the era of Master Bill Bossert, a scientist. In the photos of recent years, Peter himself is standing front and center, with me and co-master Dorothy Austin.
Among the many places in the University where Peter Gomes will be missed is Lowell House, where he was a member of the Senior Common Room for four decades. His relationship with Lowell House is a striking instance of just how important House affiliation can be in developing a sense of this complex place we call "Harvard." At a time when the Senior Common Room is becoming somewhat vestigial in many of Harvard's thirteen Houses, faculty might well take note of Peter's claim that it was the Lowell House SCR that enabled him to become who he was at Harvard.
At the Lowell House 75th anniversary in the spring of 2006, Peter spoke to a large celebratory gathering in the House library.  He said, "Coming into this House afforded me a view of Harvard which otherwise would have been denied me and therefore would have deprived me of perhaps the most happy and constructive relationship I have had with the University, including my job as Plummer Professor of Christian Morals."
Here he discovered what President Lowell, the architect of the House system, called "a microcosm of the whole university."  With his usual command of the bon mot, Peter called it "Harvard on the half shell," where the mysteries of the University are split open and served up together. He said, "Being introduced to Harvard on the half shell was an extraordinary experience. The SCR is an extravagant collection of souls from hither and yon. As a young man trying to make his way in the University and not capable of going everywhere, it was wonderful to have people from nearly everywhere come to Lowell House. And they did --on Fridays for lunch, at high table dinners, and at marvelous gatherings in the masters' residence. In the Lowell Senior Common Room, I met on a regular basis people from the Medical School, the Law School, and other faculties of the University. I could not imagine any other place at Harvard where such a crowd as this would gather."
It was also in Lowell House that Peter was introduced to the reality of Harvard College and where he began to understand the importance of the House system.  It goes without saying that the Harvard houses are primarily the residence of students, whose tribal loyalties are stirred each spring on Housing Day as a new class of students are initiated, with T-shirts and hoopla, into the House where lottery luck has placed them. Before long, however, they realize that a House is not just a dormitory and that students are not its only members. There are resident tutors from across the university, working toward doctoral degrees in English and Chinese, anthropology and computer science, medicine and law. They are inspired not only by their interaction with undergraduates, but also by the opportunity to move beyond their departments into a rich and diverse intellectual community. So, too, for members of the faculty.  In the House, the faculty is configured in a different way, through relationships cultivated quite outside the culture of departments. At its best, the House is an intergenerational community, unique in American higher education.  President Lowell called it "a social experiment with a moral purpose."
When Dorothy and I were invited to take the helm of Lowell House as Masters, Peter was the first to congratulate us, leaving a huge bouquet of stargazer lilies on the porch of our house on Trowbridge  Street.  We, too, became part of that unique social experiment. We became friends with the older members of the SCR, like Dr. Maurice Pechet who, by now, is in his nineties and still comes to weekly lunches and teas. We experienced the fellowship of people from the Kennedy, Education and Design schools as well as members of diverse departments within the University, and, of course,  Peter Gomes.
Looking at those photos across the years, we have watched our collective selves grow older, year by year, surrounded by a multitude of younger faces.  On May 11, Lowell House came together to remember Peter and to plant a tree in the courtyard in his honor. We cherish his final words to us at the 75th: "It is a privilege to be part of this House, to be part of something that is alive and vibrant, and to envision the glory that is ahead of us. It is wonderful for us to be here. Floriat Domus Lowellia.
Diana L. Eck is Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies and co-House Master of Lowell House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meddling with the structure of a nearly four-century-old institution would be enough to make most people a bit nervous. For University President Drew G. Faust, it gave her shivers.
Harvard’s historian president announced late last year that she would significantly reform the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. The decision to change an organization that has essentially remained static in form since its founding in 1650 resonated strongly with a woman steeped in American history.
“Changing the Corporation gave us shivers,” Faust said. “I have never felt more a part of a tradition and that we were intervening in ways that were preparing Harvard for its next century and perhaps the century beyond.”
The reforms, which overhauled the oldest corporate body in the Western hemisphere, include nearly doubling its membership from 7 to 13, the introduction of six-year term limits for members, and the creation of new subcommittees.
Though the reforms sound bureaucratic, their tremors may be felt far down the organizational chart.
But shivers or not, it remains unclear how the historic expansion, announced in December, will impact how the Corporation carries out its work, increases accountability in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and responds to calls for more transparency.
In large part, the Corporation’s new direction will be shaped by the individuals who join in the coming years. But the short list is a tightly guarded secret that no one close to the Corporation is willing to disclose.
And until the new members are announced and the subcommittees’ work is underway, the impact of the Corporation’s restructuring cannot be measured, and its success as a modernized governing body remains to be seen.
WHY NOW?
After 350 years of fairly smooth sailing, a structural overhaul of the Corporation might seem unexpected. While the Corporation underwent a review in the 1970s, it did not result in any significant changes, according to Henry Rosovsky, a former member of the Corporation and a former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Pressure to reform had been building for several years and had both internal and external origins before culminating in 2008.
The economic crisis of that year rocked global markets and resulted in a precipitous drop in the value of Harvard’s endowment and led the entire University “to take a hard look at its role and operations. The Corporation thought it should not be an exception,” according to a report issued by the Governance Review Committee.
Reform at Harvard has mirrored a broader concern within higher education to more critically assess universities’ exposure to risk.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers’ rocky departure from Harvard also contributed to soul-searching within the Corporation, the body that was responsible for hiring and firing Summers.
All this took place against a backdrop of reform within governing bodies in the private sector that followed the Enron and WorldCom scandals, according to Graduate School of Education professor Richard P. Chait.
“This concern about reform was in the air and present in lots of conversations among people nationwide who were executives and also served as college trustees,” said Chait, who specializes in higher-education governance and advised the Corporation on the reforms.
Additionally, in the aftermath of the financial crisis the Corporation came under attack by faculty and alumni for a lack of transparency.
In December 2009—around the time that the review of the Corporation was launched—Harvard Professors Frederick H. Abernathy and Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe calling for some Corporation members to resign in the wake of the nearly 30 percent decline in the endowment’s value during the financial crisis.
In the op-ed, they called the Corporation “a dangerous anachronism” and said that “it is too small, too closed, and too secretive to be intensely self-critical.”
Robert D. Reischauer ’63, who heads the Corporation as its senior fellow, said when the reforms were announced that the changes would partly address these criticisms and that the Corporation would move toward increased openness.
That spirit is most evident in the Corporation’s newest member, William F. Lee ’72, the group’s newest member, who said that he would, for example, make himself available for interviews with The Crimson and meet regularly with students. Several other members of the Corporation declined to be interviewed for this article.
Chait said he expects that the senior fellow and the president of the Corporation will initiate more formal and informal conversations with individuals in the University to open lines of communication.
Abernathy, arguably the Corporation’s most vocal critic, said he is only “cautiously optimistic” about the reforms.
“The optimistic part is they’ve actually undertaken potentially some reform—it’s all potential and now the proof will be who they appoint. Let’s say if they appoint six Wall Street people, I would say it’s not an improvement at all.”
EXPANDING MEMBERSHIP
In the Corporation’s early days, the body consisted of a clubby group of Boston lawyers that served as a sort of informal kitchen cabinet for the University president.
As Harvard has evolved, the Corporation has gradually changed—but not always for the better.
Recently, the Corporation has come under scathing criticism for what many perceive to be an over the top commitment to secrecy and a troubling lack of accountability.
When Faust rolled out the reforms late last year, it was clear that the new policies were meant to address these criticisms head on. With the expansion of the body’s size from 7 to 13 members and the adoption of term limits, the body sought to become more specialized and responsive.
Still, even after these reforms, the Corporation remains the smallest board among its peer institutions. Private colleges and universities typically have boards composed of 25 to 60 members, according to Lucie Lapovsky, who runs a higher-education consulting firm that advises on governance issues.
A wider membership allows for the inclusion of a variety of specialists that a bring a deep knowledge on a given issue to a university’s operation. Because of the Corporation’s limited size, individuals selected for the board have historically been generalists with a broad spectrum of skills.
Now, the generalist may be giving way to the expert.
The Corporation’s wish list includes 10 or 12 important skills, and it is currently looking “for people that fill two or three of them,” said Reischauer. He declined to specify what areas of specialization they hope to fill.
Lee said that a background in international work, science and technology, or experience running a large institution would all be valuable skills that a new Corporation member might bring to the table.
According to Chait, subjects that historically have lacked representation include engineering, medicine, stem cell research, and knowledge of international corporations.
“These are areas that are not only explosive in terms of knowledge but are also game-changers,” said Chait.
Eve J. Higginbotham, a member of the Board of Overseers, said she would like to see expertise in the sciences on the Corporation. Higginbotham also said she supports increasing diversity among the Corporation’s membership.
Currently, five of the Corporation’s seven members are white, one is black, and one is Asian. Three of the members are women.
Upping the Corporation’s membership also raises the possibility that accountability will be diluted among its members.
But over the course of its history, Harvard has become sprawling and decentralized, requiring a larger team of leaders.
“Harvard is a big enough place,” said Rosovsky. “Even if you divide responsibility by 13, you’ll still have a lot of responsibility.”
Given the size of the University, a larger membership may be a step in the right direction toward better integrating the Corporation into Harvard’s affairs.
“I think the reforms will help the Corporation to be a more responsive and agile governing body,” Higginbotham said. “That sounds like a paradox—that if it’s bigger it won’t be as agile, but I don’t think that will be the case.”
With the new set of reforms, members of the Corporation will now be subject to six-year term limits, which promises to increase turnover and will help prevent the Corporation from becoming stagnant.
“The newcomer will ask the innocent or stupid question that brings to light some interesting issues that are going on at the institution,” Lapovsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-nine years ago, with a smile on my face and all my music in me, I graduated from Stanford with a B.A. in history and an admission to Stanford Medical School. What turned out to be for me even more availing was that from 1960 through 1962 I had participated in a Special Program in the Humanities. This small, experimental program brought together under 20 undergraduates and an almost equal number of full professors. Each semester we took part in an interdisciplinary seminar that examined a shared theme from multiple perspectives.
My first semester in the program proved to be the single most influential intellectual experience I have had in a long career devoted to academic questions in the borderland between the humanities and biomedicine. The subject was Europe 1905, and with the guidance of experts in the natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, we examined events of the time in physics, medicine, art history, music, architecture, politics, economics, everyday popular culture, and social life through primary sources. It was a most extraordinary experience: mind expanding and centered on what really mattered in the world at a particular time and in a particular place. Our conversations in seminar were intended to recreate the uncertainties, dangers, and prospects that the past held for those who had lived through it. These discussions shaped my sensibility to such an extent that my own career, which explored the lived experience between medicine and anthropology, became more or less a footnote to this model of the best kind of interdisciplinarity. This, among other models of how to practice the life of the mind, motivates me as a teacher and scholar to this day.
I have tried to bring the sheer excitement, deep seriousness, and liberating promise of this approach to my students and research collaborators at Harvard over 35 years. At times, I felt I had succeeded in sharing this sensibility to the inseparability of cultural, aesthetic, scientific, and ethical questions; and at times, I felt disappointed by the inadequacy of my skills in pursuing this goal.
But whether I succeeded or failed in realizing my ideal, what Harvard offered me and my students is the empowering sense that we could together aspire to excellence in an intellectual and, I now also believe, moral quest to build a structure of enquiry that models how a life of the mind could be lived not just for each of us as individuals but in our thoroughly intersubjective local worlds as friends, family members, and colleagues.
I hope many of you who commence today have had experiences—albeit the model of enquiry may be distinctive—not so different from mine. I now see this educational opportunity as a great gift that over such a long journey of living keeps the mind alive and the spirit optimistic. It is a tonic that prevents cynicism, no matter how disappointing at times our circumstances and conditions become.
I know this personally from caring for my late wife, Joan Kleinman, during her almost decade-long struggle with Alzheimer’s Disease. For me, an aesthetic and ethical framework for making sense of things and trying to shape an enabling human response to the dangers that the cold, fateful indifference of nature brings our way, is evidence that education is both for our own paedeia and cultivation of the self, but ultimately, also for our responsibilities for caregiving for those we love, for those we teach, and for those we live amongst in our troubling yet wondrous world. Self-fashioning and caregiving are our tasks. Creating a method of continuously and intensively educating ourselves over the life course is for knowledge, but also for wisdom, beauty, goodness and above all, as Joan taught me over nearly 46 years of marriage, love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Melissa thought she had a decent grasp of drinking at Harvard, but a night ending in the back of an ambulance proved her dangerously wrong.
Nearly two months into her Harvard career, Melissa did not consider herself a regular drinker. She only went out about once a week, she says—but she freely admits that when she went out, she went hard.
In a friend’s room in an upperclassman House, Melissa—whose name, like many of the students in this story, has been changed due to the sensitivity surrounding underage drinking—started her night with half a Solo cup of vodka and a beer, a running total of about six drinks. She then made her way around the final club circuit, playing beer pong and adding to her drink count.
Her next stop, she thought, would be a room party in the Quad—but she never made it. As soon as she arrived, she started vomiting, so much so that her friend, frightened, dialed 911.
Melissa’s memory of the rest of the night is fuzzy, but based on what her friends have told her, she has been able to reconstruct the evening: An ambulance took her from the Quad to the hospital, where her blood alcohol content clocked in at .23. From there, the Harvard University Police Department transported her to Harvard University Health Services, where she remained until the next morning.
Her friend was scared that night, and so, too, are administrators at Harvard College, who are increasingly seeing their students’ nights end like this. HUPD received 73 percent more calls this year for alcohol-related medical emergencies compared to three years ago, supporting the growing concern among College administrators.
While the College has enacted policies that more explicitly restrict alcohol consumption, it has also taken a more active stance this year in attempting to influence students’ drinking behaviors. But in these efforts, the administration has come up against the pervasiveness of alcohol’s presence on Harvard’s campus.
TRANSFORMING ALCOHOL POLICY
Over the past few years, there has been a clear shift in the College’s relationship with alcohol. In 2003, the Undergraduate Council began allocating money that directly funded alcohol for student events in a program fondly remembered as the “Party Grants.”
But in the intervening years, as administrators have seen underage drinking statutes grow stricter across the state, the University has tightened its control over alcohol.
By spring of 2008, newly appointed Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam had cut the Party Grants.
That same year, changes in the Boston Police Department’s rules about tailgates pushed administrators to end the Harvard-Yale tailgate at kickoff. The Police Department’s change in policy came after a 2004 incident when 25 students were hospitalized for alcohol-related incidents and 29 students were ejected for underage drinking.
ALCOHOL IN THE HOUSES
In the intervening years since Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds became dean, the College has made a number of calculated moves meant to restrict underage drinking on campus.
In March, Hammonds sent a memo to House Masters asking that they enforce the College’s alcohol policy more consistently. Hammonds says that she has focused this spring on consistency rather than standardization.
For example, instead of mandating that each House have Student Event Services (SES) teams of trained graduate students at their events, Hammonds has asked House Masters to determine who they consider to be responsible adults—be they SES teams, tutors, or trained students—and stick to this policy. At Lowell House events this translates to House Committee members and tutors checking IDs; in Adams, that responsibility is delegated to a former resident tutor; and in Pforzheimer House, the responsibility was handed over to school-sponsored Beverage Authorization Teams, the predecessors to SES teams.
Hammonds’s initiatives had an immediate effect across the Houses, as Pfoho canceled its semiannual golf event—which involved drinks and food in students’ rooms throughout the House. Pfoho House Masters cited the inability to control who could drink and the game-like nature of the event in their House-wide email that explained the decision.
The move elicited an uproar over the House’s open-list, which often reflects the ebb and flow of student anger.
While the effects of Hammonds’ refined policy had varying ramifications for House steins, House formal alcohol policies were more universally affected.
Alex—a 21-year-old sophomore—recalled his experience at a House formal this spring. After dinner in the dining hall, Alex and his roommate met up with their dates in Alex’s room to “pre-game” the night.
By 8:30 p.m., strains of indie music floated through the common room. The four drank two bottles of wine and a mix of vodka and cranberry juice.
As the couples got ready to leave for the formal, his friends—all underage and worried they wouldn’t be able to drink more once they arrived—decided they “weren’t drunk enough.” They downed more of the vodka-cranberry mix in preparation for the potentially dry night ahead, leaving behind two empty wine bottles and a half-consumed bottle of vodka.
“We need to get a certain amount of drunk before we go because we’re not going to be able to drink anymore,” Alex says.
Once they arrived at formal, though, the drinking did not end. Alex flashed his ID at the bar and picked up a few drinks for his underage companions.
GOING FOUR LOKO
In addition to administrators’ attempts to monitor and control the drinking that the College officially sponsors, administrators have worked to stamp out what they see as particularly egregious and dangerous instances of student drinking.
For the past two years, College administrators have attempted to end a “supposed tradition” called “River Run,” after the Class of 2012 “took housing activities to an extreme,” according to a 743-word email sent to all freshmen by Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 this spring.
In River Run’s heyday, freshmen moved from House to House taking shots in courtyards and in suites. The exact traditions were unclear—some took shots for the Houses they wanted, others for Houses they didn’t. Then, some freshmen—brazenly violating the law and College policy—would set paper boats aflame in the Charles River to “Please the River Gods.”
While freshmen still continued to trek across campus this spring for River Run, their movements were more tepid and their drinking more guarded.
Dingman’s threats that rogue students could face the Administrative Board—Harvard’s primary disciplinary body—or potential arrest seemed to have their intended effect.
In addition to Dingman’s email, the day before River Run, Hammonds published an op-ed in The Crimson—only her third in her three years as dean and her first piece published alone—warning of the dangers of binge drinking and touting the College’s success in mitigating out of control drinking at this year’s Harvard-Yale tailgate.
In the op-ed, Hammonds made no mention of the following night’s potential for risky activities. Instead she defended the College’s policies regarding alcohol at the Harvard-Yale tailgate which, though unchanged from previous years, some students deemed restrictive.
“The lesson of The Game is that the development of a clear, consistently enforced policy can have a dramatic and positive effect on the problem of dangerous drinking and on student life at Harvard,” Hammonds wrote. “Since 2006, this approach—modified to allow House Committees to bring beer and wine into the tailgating area—has contributed to a change in College culture.”
As reflected in Hammonds’ op-ed, the College’s efforts to prevent unsafe drinking habits are often motivated by an intent to educate the student body.
The College’s response to the obsession for the alcoholic and caffeinated drink Four Loko that swept across American colleges and made its way to Harvard this past fall is representative of that effort.
Before states across the nation passed laws that placed restrictions on the sale of caffeinated alcoholic beverages, College officials informed undergraduates about the dangers of Four Loko in an email.
The message warned of blackouts, severe dehydration, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and alcohol poisoning that could result from alcoholic drinks with stimulants.
One senior says that the novelty of Four Loko, coupled with its forbidden nature, increased its appeal to Harvard students.
While Lowell tutor Christian M. Lane recognized the dangers of Four Loko, he says that the warnings had also drawn attention to the drink.
“Because it had been made an issue everybody then needed to experience it,” Lane said, adding that he didn’t think the drink had much else going for it.
A GROWING TREND
Despite the College’s efforts to create a safe and legal drinking culture at Harvard, UHS admittance numbers, increasing HUPD alcohol-related incident responses, and student accounts all show that dangerous drinking continues to be a problem on campus.
Over the past three years, admittances to UHS for alcohol-related sickness have been rising. In February 2010, Director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Ryan M. Travia predicted alcohol-related admittances to UHS would reach 200 for the 2009-2010 academic year.
Recently, Travia has repeatedly declined to release alcohol-related UHS numbers to The Crimson. But, in a meeting for residential tutors in January, Hammonds and University Provost Steven E. Hyman presented the figures for the 2010 fall semester.
Admittances to UHS for alcohol-related sickness had nearly reached the entire total for the 2009-2010 academic year by the end of the 2010-2011 fall semester, according to tutors in the meeting.
Despite their reluctance to publicly release numbers that would demonstrate an increase in UHS admittances, administrators have said that any increase can largely be attributed to the College’s 2007 amnesty policy—which promises no disciplinary action against intoxicated students seeking medical attention and those who help them.
But in the past decade, the numbers of alcohol related admittances had already skyrocketed before the introduction of the amnesty policy.
By 2005—two years before adopting the policy—the number of UHS admittances due to alcohol-related sickness had increased by nearly nine-fold over six years, according to an interview with Travia in February 2010.
Then, from 2005 until 2008 alcohol-related admittances remained relatively flat. Since then, alcohol hospitalizations have been on the rise.
UHS numbers are not the only signal that high-risk drinking at Harvard continues to be a problem.
HUPD tracks the number of alcohol-related medical calls they receive each academic year, and during the 2008-2009 school year HUPD saw 106 incidents involving undergraduates. In 2009-2010, HUPD responded to 123 calls. This year, 183 students called HUPD—a 49 percent increase from the previous year. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano provided the numbers to The Crimson.
It is these types of statistics that are of particular concern to administrators.
“If we had one transport of a student every weekend, that would still be worrisome,” Hammonds says.
WORK HARD, PLAY HARD
These UHS and HUPD numbers reflect some of the more drastic cases of binge drinking on campus. And, while not all cases land students in beds at Stillman Infirmary, they are part of an unhealthy culture that tutors, students, and administrators say has infiltrated Harvard social life.
“Sometimes you’ll finish up something really big and it’ll be like ‘I just really want to forget about everything,’” one senior explains. “People think ‘I’ve worked hard, so I’ve earned this.’”
It is this mentality that college administrators say is most worrying, as it can lead to binge drinking—generally defined as four drinks for women and five drinks for men in under a two hour time period.
Lane says that he thinks Harvard undergraduates approach drinking with “the same efficiency” as they do their academics and drink with the goal of getting drunk.
He says that he sees his students beginning to drink later in the evening as a result of their studies, causing them to gravitate toward hard alcohol and leaving less time for them to process their drinks.
Among students interviewed for this article, nearly everyone said that hard alcohol is the drink of choice on campus.
“They go all out in so many areas of their lives, and to some degree that intense approach to academics or to athletics translates to social life as well,” Travia says.
THE NON-DRINKER
Even for students who choose not to drink, alcohol can be a defining factor in social situations at Harvard.
In painting the picture of alcohol consumption on campus, Harvard administrators often tout the below-average percentage of students who drink regularly.
“The trend nationally is for more incoming freshmen arriving on campus not having any experiences with alcohol, and at Harvard we are also seeing more students continuing alcohol abstinence once they’re on campus,” Travia says.
But even committed non-drinkers can find themselves regularly spending their weekends with their intoxicated peers.
Jenny, a sophomore, says she came to college having decided not to drink because of personal and religious preferences. She recalls some of the awkwardness of her decision when she first got to college, but notes that she has become increasingly comfortable over the last two years, even though most of her friends choose to drink.
“Freshman year it was a little easier said than done,” Jenny says.
But now, dealing with friends who drink has become a part of her life.
On an average weekend night, Jenny will gather with her friends in one of their common rooms. She says that most of her friends use this time to pre-game and strategize the night via text messages. Options range from birthday parties in dorm rooms to final clubs.
When her friends arrive at the party, Jenny goes with them to the bar, occasionally getting a drink of water to avoid questions.
While she says that she is typically the friend who finds lost phones or worries more about those who are with her, she says she does not feel thrust into the role of the sober friend.
“[Not drinking] maybe makes you more worried about your friends,” Jenny says. “It’s nice to know you can keep an eye out.”
COLORING THE CONVERSATION
Beyond shaping many undergraduates’ weekend nights, alcohol plays an often-unstated role in discussions of social life.
Since last spring, the UC has been working to bring back a modified form of the Party Grants, now requiring students to spend almost half the money they receive on SES teams and to hold events in House common spaces.
The effort, called “Student Initiated Programs,” allows students to throw medium-sized parties and is meant to encourage inclusive socializing on campus. And, for the first time since Pilbeam eliminated the Party Grants, the UC is paying for alcohol again.
In this issue as in many others, discussions of social life on campus often have an underlying question: Where can students drink?
When students debate the seemingly unending topic of social space on campus, alcohol colors those discussions as well.
“Last semester I was just getting so frustrated that we didn’t have any place to throw down,” says one freshman boy. “I actually considered throwing a hard core rager in the basement of Lamont or on the roof of the Science Center.”
But this freshman’s frustration is exacerbated by a larger problem. The reality that many Harvard undergraduates are underage, but continue to violate Massachusetts law and College policy to drink, makes it difficult for administrators to engage with these students openly.
“People at Harvard want to be spoken to on realistic terms,” Lane says. “Tha	t’s a hard thing to do because obviously this is all illegal for the majority of our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late October and November, Harvard students received a flood of emails from the Harvard University Police Department about crimes occurring on and near campus. The sudden spike in violent crime caused many to question their safety and change their daily habits.
“I remember I kept getting email [advisories] on different nights,” says Emily K. Harburg ’11, a resident of Mather House. “It was a bit of a surprise to me—you get in the bubble, and you feel really sheltered and comfortable.”
Harburg used to take shortcut paths and smaller streets when walking back to her House at night, but she then switched to paths that were more “socially in Harvard” as opposed to the shorter ones after reading the alerts.
Similarly, Nicole K. Kapu ’14 quickened her pace as she walked through the dimly lit sidewalk from Lamont at night as she crossed the Barker Center on her way to her dorm in Hurlbut.
Benjamin A. Silva ’14, in his first semester at Harvard, was walking with two male friends on Brattle Street early November at 2 a.m. when a man attempted to rob them at gunpoint.
“I was in a very safe position . . . I was with two others.” Silva says. “I was doing all those things.”
The Harvard University Campus Escort Program made 40 escorted trips in November, doubling the number of trips they made during November 2009, according to information provided by HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano in December. Prior to the spike, only 10 trips had been made in the month of October, indicating that students turned to available safety resources after the increase in crime.
Though according to the Cambridge Police Department, violent crime and robberies in Cambridge from 2009 to 2010 decreased by 3 and 5 percent, respectively, the University experienced 10 robberies on or near campus between Oct. 30 and Nov. 21—eight of which took place in the first two weeks.
In response to the increase in crime, the College and students began to take cautionary measures while HUPD and Cambridge police tracked and investigated the incidents.
Through the combination of increased communication at biweekly meetings and open sharing of data with civilians and neighboring police departments, CPD was able to address the worrying trend and arrest suspects who were allegedly involved in the robberies.
The spike in robberies prompted changes in HUPD and CPD policing procedures as the departments coordinated their efforts to control and minimize crime in Cambridge.
CRIME AFTER CRIME
The string of crimes that began at the end of October and stretched into late November were spread throughout Harvard Square, ranging from around Mass. Ave., near the Quad, to inside the Yard.
The crime wave began with a robbery at the Harvard University Credit Union on Oct. 30, when an unarmed man stole $8,372 in cash from the bank, according to HUPD. No one was harmed.
Two days later, two Harvard affiliates were robbed at knifepoint six minutes apart by two men near the Harvard Divinity School. One victim received a stab wound, and the suspects stole the victim’s cell phone, wallet, and cash after the victim refused to comply with the demand for the victim’s possessions.
The victims’ descriptions of the suspects to Cambridge police matched those of suspects who had committed four street robberies at knifepoint near MIT in the previous week.
On Nov. 2, the robberies continued when suspects of the same description stole a Somerville resident’s laptop, cell phone, and wallet on Shepard Street outside of the Quad.
Later that night, men of the same description robbed a resident at knifepoint on Albany Street near MIT.
One the suspects was arrested the next day, but the other remained at large. The robberies continued.
A man was robbed on Mass. Ave. outside of the Dudley Co-op on Nov. 6 by two suspects who demanded the victim’s money and then sliced his face with a pocket knife. Although this crime was conducted by two suspects again, Cambridge police said, at the time, they did not think the robberies were connected.
The following week, on Nov. 11, a man unaffiliated with Harvard was robbed at gunpoint in the Yard near Thayer Hall. The victim complied and handed over his wallet to the suspect. A suspect was later arrested by Cambridge police. While the event was the fifth robbery in Harvard Square in two weeks, it was the first time a gun was presented.
A different suspect, who has recently been found guilty, fired a gun at a member of CPD when the officer interrupted the man’s attempt to rob Silva and two other Harvard freshmen on Nov. 13 on Brattle Street. The suspect was caught shortly thereafter.
Another suspect, who was later arrested, and two accomplices robbed a Boston resident by the Harvard Square T Station and demanded the victim’s cell phone and wallet early in the morning on Nov. 16.
A male Harvard undergraduate was robbed on the corner of Walker Street and Shepard Street on Nov. 21. The CPD said, at the time, they did not think the incident was related to others in the spike.
ACTING FAST
In response to the spree of robberies in the fall of 2010, HUPD and Cambridge police swiftly enacted measures to increase safety around Harvard’s campus.
HUPD upped the number of officers on patrol in street clothes and uniforms, according to Catalano.
“Officers made themselves visible on campus,” Catalano says.
For example, police vehicles parked in the Yard would keep their lights turned on to signal police presence.
Issuing prompt community advisories each time a crime was committed contributed to the crime’s notoriety, says Daniel M. Riviello, who joined CPD in May 2010 as its new spokesperson.
Additionally, information has been conveyed efficiently and regularly between the five neighboring police departments, including HUPD and the MBTA police.
Per the request of the Cambridge City Council, CPD became more transparent in publishing their crime statistics. Under a new initiative called BridgeStat, CPD releases to the public a comprehensive analytical document of Cambridge crimes, statistics, and trends the first week of every month on their website.
“[Cambridge police] increased better use of data and intelligence, increased better communication between police departments, and increased information sharing,” says Daniel Wagner, the commanding officer for the department of crime analysis and technical services for Cambridge police.
They also increased their presence and security surrounding Harvard’s campus by reallocating their officers throughout the day to reflect the crime patterns that statistics described.
The College administration has also worked with HUPD and Cambridge police to increase the safety of campus for students.
The Office of Student Life announced in December that the College would “adopt a more visible stance” in response to the crimes that took place in November.
Students are frequently advised by the College to lock their doors, not allow people to follow them into residences, and take notice of their surroundings.
“We have a really robust security system in place,” says Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, “and what we sometimes have to do more of, and we are doing, is making students understand that.
CAPTURING THE SUSPECTS
One day in early November, within 12 hours of an inter-police unit “meeting to formulate a strategy to address these incidents,” police officials arrested one robbery suspect who was possibly involved in a string of eight robberies, according to the alert sent after his capture.
This arrest was made possible by the efforts of seven different police departments and the U. S. Secret Service, the advisory said.
The suspect, Santony Joseph, pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of armed robbery and three charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon on Jan. 14.
Kai R. Kruger, who was accused of attempted murder after holding students up, fleeing the scene, and firing a gun at a Cambridge police officer who pursued him on foot, was arrested on Nov. 13. Kruger was found guilty of 12 counts of armed robbery, intimidating a witness, assault with intent to murder, and carrying a firearm after his trial ended on May 6. Kruger will be sentenced on May 31.
Paul Gowell, a suspect in the robbery of the Harvard University Employees Credit Union on Oct. 30, was arrested on Dec. 20. Cambridge police and the FBI Bank Robbery Task Force had been tracking the string of bank robberies in Cambridge and set up surveillance to observe Gowell.
Gowell pleaded not guilty to all six charges, five of which were for unarmed robbery, on April 1.
Fernando Martinez was arrested on Nov. 16 for a robbery he had allegedly committed that morning, according to the Cambridge Police log. He was charged with robbery, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.
A suspect in the Yard robbery—in which a man unaffiliated with the University was robbed at gunpoint outside of Thayer Hall on Nov. 11—was arraigned on Nov. 12.
Cambridge police says that increased communication with other police departments facilitated several arrests of suspects involved in the October and November crime spree.
SAFE NOW?
Catalano acknowledges the spike in crime, but says he is confident in the safety of Harvard’s campus.
“Harvard is a safe campus in a safe city that experienced a spike in violent crime,” Catalano says.
Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis echoes these sentiments. While two crimes in the October and November spree occurred near the Quad on Shepard Street, he says the shuttle service provides a safe transportation option for students.
“I think [the campus] is as safe as one can hope for in a urban environment. I think it’s great that we can provide shuttle service. We can always provide more shuttle service,” Christakis says.
Indeed, despite the increase in robberies, one student said he never felt at risk.
“I still feel safe even though I see the alerts,” Christopher M. Goldstein ’13 says. “It hasn’t happened to me.”
Harburg adds that Harvard’s transparency about the crimes shows that the University is committed to student safety.
“In general, it seems like Harvard has been really good at making us feel safe,” Harburg said. “It’s good that they’re willing to share that experience with us and not keep us naïve to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventeen years ago, I loaded up a Jeep with all of my stuff and left Kirkland House to return to Kentucky to start my post-Harvard career.  This past January, I loaded up a Toyota Highlander with all of my stuff and left Kentucky to return to Kirkland House to start my post-Kentucky career as director of the Institute of Politics.
I never thought I would be the director of the IOP.  Maybe a fellow, but not the director.  As a student I was very involved with the IOP, ultimately serving as vice chair of the Student Advisory Committee.  I was honored when asked to serve on the Senior Advisory Committee upon being elected Kentucky’s Secretary of State in 2003.  It was fun coming back to campus once a semester to listen to the staff and students talk about the past semester’s successes.
When I lost in the Republican U.S. Senate Primary to Rand Paul last year (yes, I’m that guy), I began to think about my future. I was term limited with only a year and a half left to serve.  I thought about running for governor or attorney general but realized that the timing wasn’t good for the former and my heart wasn’t in it for the latter.
While I was pondering the future, a woman with the firm retained to perform the search for the next IOP director called to see if I had any suggestions for the type of director they should seek.  During the course of the conversation, I casually, but intentionally, said that I would love to do the job some day.  Crickets were chirping as she steered the conversation to the next topic.  I hung up, disappointed.
A few months later she called back and asked me if I remembered mentioning that I would love to be the IOP director some day.  I said yes, and my heart began to race.  Then she asked, “What if that some day were now?”  At that point, I knew what the future would hold.
After a bunch of interviews and countless conversations with family and friends, I accepted the director’s position and agreed to start work this semester.  I have been spending the semester back on campus in an apartment, while my wife and daughters are back in Kentucky finishing up the school year.  They will join me this summer when we move into a home in Belmont.
At times, this semester I have felt like Rip Van Winkle waking up after a seventeen-year slumber. Not only do I live in Kirkland House again, I am living in B-entry, the entry where I lived during my junior year.  Bob is still the security guard in Kirkland, and he continues to dispense late-night wisdom mixed with a heavy dose of cynicism.
The Kirkland Dining Hall looks the same as before—the Coke Zero is nice addition, though. I was glad to hear that Kirkland continues to host the Holiday Dinner and Dance.  (Yes, back in the day, we called it by that other name, too.)
The same guys are serving up tasty pizza and subs at Noch’s, and the Spare Change guy is still selling newspapers in front of Au Bon Pain.  (He still calls me “Big Guy” when he sees me.)
Of course, much has changed about Harvard in the past seventeen years.  Radcliffe is now a research institute, and Housing assignments are random.  The student body is a lot more diverse and international than in 1994.  The students also seem to be busier with more extracurricular activities than ever before.
Technology is now everywhere, from the cell phones attached to the ears of students walking to and from the Yard to the ubiquitous laptops under the arms of many students.  I didn’t even get an email address or cell phone until the summer after I graduated.  I have been asked more than once by students how I ever managed.
I have also had to adjust to new lingo and traditions.  For example, PBH is now PBHA.  The Kennedy School is now HKS, not KSG.  House Committees are now called HoCo.  (Why didn’t we think of that?)  And Ivy League Champion was not a phrase ever associated with the Men’s basketball program.
Since this is a commencement issue, I guess I should conclude with some parting wisdom for the graduates.  And as the director of the IOP, you probably aren’t surprised that I feel compelled to urge you to be involved in politics.
You don’t have to run for office like me, but you “must be a participant and not a spectator,” as President Kennedy so eloquently challenged all educated citizens.  There are plenty of opportunities out there.  There are countless quality candidates who are running for office at all levels of government who need your support.  There are also plenty of good people who need encouragement to run.  I wouldn’t have made it without that encouragement and support.
Regardless of what you do, just remember how fortunate you are to have spent four years at Harvard.  I remember having that thought as I walked through the Yard the night before graduation.  Seventeen years later, that is something that hasn’t changed.
Trey Grayson ’90 is the director of the Institute of Politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m sick of creative people.
Creativity is overrated. Don’t get me wrong: I love art, and I love artists. I married one. As blasphemous as this no doubts sounds, however, I have come to the conclusion that the knee-jerk equation of art and ideas with creation, and more generally, our society’s equation of anything good, valuable, or worthwhile with creation, degrades culture, demeans art, and devalues life. The problem with the concept of creativity is that it elevates production over revision, innovation over reform, novelty over preservation, and the making of something over the nurturing of something. We need creation, certainly, but we do not need an entire culture devoted to it. What we need is a culture devoted to care, to cultivation and protection, to tending to what we already have. That is what the word “culture” means.
Our society is addicted to creation. We are innovation junkies looking for our next fix. We have convinced ourselves that creation is intrinsically meaningful. We create for the sake of creating, as though the act of making something—money, ideas, babies, art, technology, love—were an end in itself, a self-evidently good thing. As any true artist will tell you, however, it is the grinding work of taking care of those created things, nurturing and cultivating them, that gives them value. To appreciate means to hold onto something. My advice (for what it’s worth) is to avoid the false charms of creation and the intellectual sugar high of creativity:the insatiable desire to make, make, make and to discover the next thing, which, let’s face it, will never be good enough. Devote your energies instead to something more substantial and artistic: taking care of the world we have, strengthening it, doting on it as if it were the last world we will ever have.
Make the world, yes, but make it last.
What is a culture devoted to endless creation, in the end, but a disposable culture in which nothing lasts, a wasteland? It is a world in which a continent-sized island of plastic sludge sloshes in the North Pacific. It is the photodegradation of our thoughtless past.
This week the Class of 2011 will stand in Harvard Yard for the last time as undergraduates. Senses will be sharpened. Trees will look more Harvardy to you, their knotted branches bittersweet. Old bricks will resonate with you in a way you never thought possible. We will crown you with laurels and then shove you (gently) into the future. We—by which I mean society—will call after you as the future whisks you away: Be creative! Be innovative! Be productive! Be fresh! Be new! Create wealth, create knowledge, create a better tomorrow! Make money, make babies, make ideas, make something of yourself, and most important of all, make your mother proud! (Just to be clear: We recommend that you wait ten years before making babies.) In short, the Class of 2011 will feel the weight of creation on their shoulders. But without culture (by which I mean an ethic of care, not a love of opera) the concept of creation will feel unbearable. It will eventually break your heart.
On the matter of creation and its drawbacks, the Victorians can provide us with guidance. They, too, lived in a world devoted to unrestricted creation: an era of unprecedented technological innovation, of rapid change, of growing populations, of unfed and unwanted children, and of the daily transformation of the old into the “new and improved.” Though they look old-fashioned to us now, they saw themselves as cutting-edge. Muttonchops were once considered hot. I won’t go so far as to say the Victorians were hip, but they were certainly interested in the next thing. They lived in a state of perpetual expectation. Their “productive” factories and “creative” smokestacks blackened the sky and thickened rivers. The Victorians built, manufactured, and invented a lot of things. We are one of their creations.
Even as so many of them unleashed their creative potential, others saw the heartbreaking consequences of a creation-addicted world. They imagined life-affirming alternatives to monstrous creativity. Some of their solutions were good, others bad. The important thing is that they tried. As a counter to the creative destruction of revolution, they proposed an alternative politics of reform. As a counter to God’s Creation, Darwin proposed a more subtle biology defined by adaptation, by gradual accommodation, by organismic responsiveness to the environment. Seeing the legions of homeless children around them, some reformers recognized that making babies is not an inherently noble act. Adopting needy children, taking care of the ones that already exist, or raising your own with special care: those acts are more miraculous, they realized, than “creation.” The endless birth of the new leads to the endless death of the old. New things are future old things. Birth is merely death. The trick is to make things last. Adaptation, adoption, cultivation, preservation, protection, reform, and revision: these are the secret ingredients of art, the source of culture.
As the Class of 2011 meets its future, and as the voices of creativity whisper in your ear, my advice is to take care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the dead of night on April 9, 1969, Michael Kazin ’70, styling himself as a modern Martin Luther, walked up to Loeb House, the home of then-University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28, and tacked a list of demands on his door as 300 fellow protesters looked on. At the top of their list was the expulsion of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.
The Harvard chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, led by Kazin, had gathered earlier that night in Lowell Lecture Hall to debate the takeover of a University building, the culmination of months-long protests against the Vietnam War and the University’s relationship with the military. By the following afternoon, the situation would reach a head as hundreds of protesters forced their way into University Hall, throwing out top administrators in protest of the University’s continued recognition of the program designed to train students for active military service.
In the intervening decades since ROTC left campus, the organization’s presence on campus has remained low-profile and symbolic of the University’s often tense relationship with the military.
But in March, Harvard made a break with the antagonism of recent years and moved to officially recognize Navy ROTC. As University President Drew G. Faust signed an agreement with Navy Secretary Ray E. Mabus in a stately room of Loeb House, Harvard’s history with ROTC appeared to have come full circle as the corps was welcomed back feet from where the leftists of the 1960s had officially demanded its expulsion.
But outside Loeb a new generation of protesters had gathered. Unlike their counterparts 40 years earlier, they are opposed to the presence of ROTC on campus because of what they see as the military’s discriminatory policies toward trans identified individuals rather than the categorical opposition to the military that characterized the dissidents of the ’60s.
Over the last half century, changing political circumstances have altered Harvard’s relationship with the armed forces as anti-militarism has become unacceptable and any criticism of the military have focused on specific policies. Within this context, the Harvard community’s relationship to the military has morphed from contentious opposition during the ’60s, to conservative reaction during the ’70s and ’80s, to one of relative indifference and apathy today.
A PATRIOTIC DECADE
When Capt. Paul E. Mawn USNR (Ret.) ’63, the current president of Advocates for Harvard ROTC, entered Harvard in 1959, the presence of the military on campus was a fact of life.
Harvard’s relationship with the military stretches back to the American Revolution, and as late as World War II the University was actively hosting a Naval officer’s school. In the 1950s, the military still commanded a great deal of respect and a relatively positive profile on campus, and, as Mawn put it, membership in ROTC was as unremarkable as membership in the Harvard band.
The financial incentives associated with the program also explained a portion of its popularity on campus.
For Malcolm T. Hill Jr. ’59, the president of the Harvard ROTC Alumni Fund, the existence of the NROTC Holloway Plan—a merit scholarship program that provided free room and board in return for military service—attracted him to ROTC. As Hill explained, it was less competitive to get into Harvard than to receive a Holloway grant when he applied to Harvard.
For many, the continued existence of the draft—as America moved from combat in Korea to Vietnam—furthered interest in ROTC as joining the program was a way to put off service and ensure a higher position after leaving school.
“I facetiously say that I dodged the draft by going into active duty,” Mawn says.
And these incentives reached across campus—in Mawn’s class, 100 of 1200 eligible students participated in one of the three branches of ROTC.
But the acceptance of ROTC went beyond practical concerns. The memory of World War II was still fresh in the minds of students, and many, like Mawn, were children of veterans. Then, the military was more than a career, and ROTC was more than a scholarship or activity. At that time, the military was something to be respected rather than reviled.
THE BREAKING POINT
But by 1969, everything had changed. As the conflict in Vietnam entered its fourteenth year and changes in the draft rules prevented ROTC from serving as a viable deferral of service, anti-military protests swept across college campuses, including Harvard.
In the years before the April 9 takeover of University Hall, tensions between student demonstrators, administrators, and the military’s place on campus had grown. In 1967, 800 students protested the appearance of Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara at the Institute of Politics, and the following year 300 protesters imprisoned a recruiter from Dow Chemical, which manufactured napalm for use in Vietnam, in a campus building. In December before the University Hall takeover, 100 students organized a sit-in at Paine Hall after being barred from Faculty meetings debating ROTC.
Already, the administration began to budge. In February, the Faculty voted to withdraw academic credit for ROTC. By that April, Kazin and other leaders of the SDS had decided that it was time to take bold action against the administration.
“It was not only the war they objected to but the whole establishment with a ‘capital E’ that was responsible for this,” Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, who has been on the faculty since 1962, says. “Part of this was the feeling that the whole country was too militaristic. It wasn’t just that this was a wrong war in the wrong place.”
According to Kazin, anti-Vietnam protesters at Harvard made ROTC a central issue because it represented a concrete way to tie the administration to the unpopular war effort, a symbol of the University’s complicity.
With this in mind, the SDS, in a move consciously reminiscent of Luther’s stand at the church of Wittenberg, tacked their demands to President Pusey’s door, setting off the following two weeks of protests.
Eight days after students seized University Hall, the Faculty voted to relegate ROTC to the status of a regular extracurricular organization, effectively cutting it off from necessary resources. The faculty vote was overwhelmingly in favor the resolution, and it passed by a 385-25 margin.
FADING FROM THE SCENE
In the years immediately following ROTC’s departure from Harvard, the military, along with the opposition to it, faded into the background of campus debate.
When Michael M. Segal ’76, a current leader of Advocates for Harvard ROTC, came to campus there was no way for Harvard students to participate in ROTC. Shannon Hall, the former headquarters of the Harvard ROTC detachment had been converted into a daycare center.
But by the time Segal had graduated, the standoff eased and Harvard students could enroll in ROTC classes and training at MIT beginning in 1976. Harvard alumni have footed the bill for Harvard cadets for much of this time. This arrangement has remained relatively unchanged over the intervening three decades.
Meanwhile, changes in the American political landscape tempered the anti-military sentiment that drove ROTC off campus. As Mansfield explains, the conservative backlash of the later decades of the 20th century—much of it a consequence of the very movement that severed Harvard’s ties with ROTC—led to an increasing acceptance of the military.
Over time, the debate over ROTC shifted to a focus on the military’s recruitment practices, which under “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” prohibited gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military.
For pro-ROTC groups, this represented a significant shift away from the anti-militarism of the sixties.
“The people who were appealing for gay rights had essentially a patriotic cause,” Segal says. “They weren’t an anti-military movement.”
Meanwhile, the lack of an official ROTC presence at Harvard kept it from the campus consciousness.
While Seth W. Moulton ’01 did not participate in ROTC during his time at Harvard, he remembers his friends’ surprise when he announced in the spring of his senior year that he intended to enlist after graduation. Then, the military was just not seen as a viable career option.
“Making the decision to serve is hard, and when all your friends are going to New York anyway, it’s just very convenient to go work in an investment bank,” Moulton says.
RESURGENCE
A few months after Moulton enlisted, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 on the World Trade Center and Pentagon once again shifted the discourse around the military at Harvard. In some ways, Moulton explains, his friends’ increased interest in enlisting after September 11, despite their surprise at his choice just a few months before, vindicated his decision to join.
Like WWII before it resulted in increased respect and admiration for the military, the outpouring of patriotism stemming from the attacks of 9/11 changed the military’s profile in this country.
“We grew up in the shadow of 9/11, and I joined the army because of 9/11,” Army Cadet Christopher W. Higgins ’11 says. “It’s something that was really ingrained in us as a generation.”
Despite an increased respect for the military, its presence on campus remained minimal after 9/11. In all three programs, roughly 20 Harvard undergraduates across all four grade levels participate in ROTC every year—down from around 100 students per class in the two immediate decades following WWII.
Current ROTC cadets at Harvard say they feel that their peers’ attitudes toward their decision to join the corps range from support to relative indifference but note that they see no open hostility.
“It’s kind of like benign neglect,” Higgins says.
Much of this trend away from open disagreement with the military as an institution represents the flip side of the patriotism sparked by the events of September 2001. While it has become socially acceptable to oppose the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, the slogan “support our troops” has become an unassailable maxim of American life.
“What we tend to do is to equate our respect for the people who were affected by 9/11 with this idea that the military is not open to criticism,” explains Diane H. Mazur, a former Air Force officer and a professor of law at the University of Florida. “Forty years ago there was much more social latitude to openly disagree.”
Amid this relatively tacit acceptance of the military, the debate over ROTC at Harvard during the past decade has shifted toward ensuring that more people are to join the program, rather than disagreement over foreign policy or outright pacifism. Now, opposition to the military’s presence is predicated on the ideal that military service is something to be lauded and open to everyone and that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and restrictions on trans identified individuals to serve violates this principle.
Pacifism, or any other variant of anti-militarism, seems to have fallen by the wayside.
Today, English Professor Louis Menand shows home-shot footage of the 1969 Harvard protests to his perennially popular class U.S. in the World 23: “Art and Thought in the Cold War.” But for many of his students, this protest ethic is a foreign concept.
“They got beat up by the cops, they got arrested,” Menand says. “Students are surprised to see how active and engaged students were in those days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Nothing that happens after we are twelve matters very much,” J.M. Barrie wrote nearly a century ago. As the author of “Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up” and as a man desperate not to lose his marbles (the glass kind with multi-colored swirls), he was an authority on the challenges of turning into an adult. Once we grow up, Barrie lamented, we are “done for,” and he spent a good part of his life mourning the moment when other children made it clear that he was too old for pirate games.
Growing up is hard to do at any time, but especially in a culture where Bob Dylan and other crooners urge us to stay “Forever Young” and shops trumpet names like “Forever 21.”  In Childhood: Its History, Philosophy, and Literature, a course I have taught for many years now, the most poignant moment in the term comes when I play a sequence from Steven Spielberg’s “Hook,” a 1991 cinematic sequel to Barrie’s “Peter Pan.” There is rarely a dry eye in the lecture hall when one of the Lost Boys contemplates the creases in Robin Williams’s grown-up face and gently reproaches him with the words: “Peter, you promised never to grow old.”
“Hook” never reveals exactly when or why Spielberg’s Peter Banning decides to grow up and become a corporate pirate who turns family man. But in “Tuck Everlasting,” inspired by Barrie’s play, Natalie Babbitt’s character makes it clear that remaining forever young can be a real curse: “I want to grow again . . . and change. And if that means I got to move on at the end of it, then I want that, too.” Readers of “Peter Pan” will know that Peter’s eternal youth comes at the price of memory, along with the cost of love, duty, commitment, and many other weight-bearing words. Neverland may be fun, games, and sport, but it also quickly transforms itself into a Nietzschean dystopia marked by the eternal return of the same. With time, even the “ecstasies innumerable” of Neverland become stale pleasures.
But is the adult world really any better?  In a commencement address at Kenyon College, David Foster Wallace famously declared: “You graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what ‘day in day out’ really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration.”
The Harvard bubble is the best insulator I know against the boredom that so tormented Wallace. In my years at this institution, each term has always delivered on the rainbow promise of fresh new ideas and intellectual surprises.  Graham Greene may have believed that there is nothing to equal the “excitement and revelation” of our first fourteen years, but he evidently also found university life at Oxford “childish and ostentatious.”
As perceptive as David Foster Wallace was in his commencement address, he discounted the boredom, routine, and petty frustration that the most precocious among you have already experienced.  Some of you may be ready to leave, not just Neverland but also the bubble that has sheltered you at Harvard.
And so, off you skip now, like the most heartless things (as Barrie would say), ready to navigate and explore terrain full of challenges that no poet, philosopher, or professor can chart for you. Off you go to the trenches of the real world, where you will get religion—that is, find out what you really want from life, what you will worship, and what will be the object of your devotion.
The real world and its inhabitants will badger you constantly about the value of getting and spending. Few will praise the fringe benefits of failure or remind you of the importance of imagination as J.K. Rowling did at Harvard’s 2008 Commencement. And almost no one will tell you that the consolations of the imagination are not imaginary consolations.
Many years ago, Mark Twain told the young woman who played Peter Pan onstage in New York how much he admired J.M. Barrie’s work. “It is my belief that ‘Peter Pan’ is a great and refining and uplifting benefaction to this sordid and money-mad age.”  Somehow I feel sure that Twain understood the importance of levitation and levity, flight and fancy, and lack of gravity and nimbleness, especially after age 12, when life begins for real, pace J.M. Barrie. And so I will simply close with words spoken some years ago at Commencement ceremonies by Jeremy R. Knowles, then Dean of the Faculty: “Soar like the eagles that you are.” I have just two words to add to his: Never land.
Maria Tatar chairs the Program in Folklore and Mythology.  She is the author of "The Annotated Peter Pan," to be published by W.W. Norton later this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2009, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said the size of the faculty would shrink as it faced a sharp drop in hiring.
In the wake of the financial crisis, FAS spending had screeched to a halt, and an unprecedented ten-year period of growth that had produced a 20 percent jump in the size of the Faculty came to a close.
Two years later, as the School recovers and the deficit slims, departments are evaluating the state of their faculties and identifying the holes that have appeared.
Administrators hope that they will now have the flexibility to fill the gaps and nurse their faculty back to health.
HIGH HOPES
As the severe budget cuts of the financial downturn recede into the past, department chairs have expressed hope that FAS will prioritize hiring in their departments in the years to come.
“I think that Government hiring will be a priority because so much of what we do is a linchpin for those working in other fields,” said Nancy L. Rosenblum, who served as Government Department chair from 2004 to 2010. “Harvard cannot have a superior program in Middle East Studies, for example, without a political scientist expert in the area, languages, and approaches to political problems there.”
Meanwhile, Sociology hopes for three to four more faculty members to remedy a student-to-faculty ratio that has been increasing as more undergraduates trend toward the concentration.
The Economics Department, the largest concentration in the College, hopes its size and its perennially high student-to-faculty will push it to the top of the FAS priority list, according to Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell.
“I hope and expect that course enrollments and faculty-concentrator ratios will have a strong effect on the allocation, although of course there are many factors that the FAS administration must take into account,” Campbell said.
Meanwhile, the History Department, in the humanities, has also suffered at the hands of budget cuts.
“In every respect the History Department at Harvard in 2011 is not what it was in the spring of 2008,” James T. Kloppenberg wrote in an April email to The Crimson. “We still have first-rate faculty, graduate programs, undergraduate students, and staff, but we all hope that the austerity measures of the last few years—necessary as we know they were—will not be permanent.”
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GOOD TIMES
Back in 2007, FAS announced a plan to grow the Faculty by 25 percent, an ambitious projection to build on the previous decade of growth.
But still unaware of the impending financial crisis, some departments missed out on the window of opportunity.
The Psychology Department simply did not have the space for more faculty members in the already overcrowded William James Hall, said Psychology Professor Mahzarin R. Banaji, the head tutor in the Psychology Department.
By the time the first-floor library moved to another building and other spaces opened up for faculty offices and labs, the FAS hiring spree had made way for School-wide budget cuts.
“[The creation of office and lab space] just coincided with the economic crisis and the University’s decision to become more stringent about growth,” Banaji said. “So we are in a peculiar and unfortunate situation.”
The Sociology Department wasted away the period of extravagance taking its time to discuss and deliberate on possible candidates, said Sociology Professor Michele Lamont.
“We didn’t seize the moment,” she said, adding that the department had proceeded slowly because it wanted to make “sound decisions.”
‘VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS’
The changing face of the Faculty has coincided with [developments in the number of concentrators] in each department.
As student interest shifted, some concentrations—in some cases with already low student-faculty ratios—have found themselves struggling to provide the same quality of undergraduate education to more students.
Few departments have seen an upsurge in students like the Sociology Department.
With 88 concentrators and no secondary field candidates in the 2006-2007 academic year, the department now has 202 concentrators and 22 secondary field candidates.
Lamont said she believes that a 2003 hiring spree re-energized the department and renewed student interest in the area.
But hiring in the department slowed when the financial crisis hit.
Two years ago, the department was forced to rescind two unofficial offers it had made to prospective junior professors as a result of the FAS budget deficit, according to Sociology Professor Orlando Patterson.
“In some ways we are the victims of our own success,” Lamont said, repeating a phrase Patterson had used to describe the department in an interview last month.
“It’s difficult to provide the same kind of high-quality teaching we are committed to [offering],” she said.
Though Department Chair Mary C. Brinton oversaw a successful junior faculty search this year, the department’s faculty size has declined by the equivalent of three full-time professors since 2003.
Even departments that have maintained steady concentrator numbers in recent years struggle with perennially high student-faculty ratios.
In particular, the Economics Department and the Psychology Department, giants in terms of number of concentrators, have exceptionally low faculty-to-student ratios for Harvard.
“Our faculty-concentrator ratio is extraordinarily low and this makes it extremely challenging for us to deliver the high-quality educational experience that Harvard economics students deserve, and that we want to give them,” Campbell said.
VISITING PROFESSORS, TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS
When the administration turned its attention to the operating costs of the Faculty, reducing the number of visiting professors in FAS proved to be an easy short-term fix.
But administrators say that these members of the faculty—professors on contract for up to five years—can play a valuable role in meeting departmental needs.
Kloppenberg said that, despite multiple postponed faculty searches, the History Department has faced a diminished visiting faculty budget.
A reduced visitors budget also affected the Economics Department, which saw a significantly lower number of visiting faculty in the 2009-10 academic year. With five fewer full-time equivalents, the department had to cut its popular junior seminar program, which has since been reinstated.
The drop in visiting faculty numbers has, for some departments, translated into fewer course offerings for students.
“The biggest problem in terms of teaching is our inability to cover certain subjects with the current composition of faculty,” Rosenblum said.
Banaji said some fraction of courses should always be taught by visiting faculty, who may have the expertise to fill gaps in departmental areas of study.
“It would be a weakness if we did not have people from the outside,” she said.
But she also pointed out that too much dependence on visiting faculty results in unpredictable course lineups and gaps in the department’s faculty expertise.
Despite FAS-wide restrictions on visiting faculty, the Psychology Department has recently relied heavily on visitors and non-tenure track faculty to fulfill the high demand for its courses. Of the 40 courses currently planned for 2011-12, only 21 will be taught by tenured faculty.
Rather than depend on non-tenure track faculty to teach almost half of the department’s offerings, she said it would be ideal to have them teach one-third to one-fourth of the courses.
But in a department with an already slim faculty, that goal can be met only by an accompanying growth in the department’s permanent faculty size—difficult during the recent budget cuts.
“What budget constraints do is they force you to prioritize, and not to stop spending,” Patterson said. “Even if you have a fiscal constraint you can still prioritize in terms of where you put your money.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes passed away on February 28, Harvard was overwhelmed by its loss. Peter, we knew, would be all but irreplaceable, and certain parts of his complex persona may be gone from the University forever. We may never again hear such a resounding, dignified voice from a Harvard professor. Once when I was with him in a restaurant, the waitress, having taken no note of him as we were seated, recognized his radio voice and greeted him by name as soon as he started to order dinner. The generous fellowship of his tea table, welcoming all, every week, through an open door only steps from Harvard Yard—where else will such a group again gather, with or without the Chinese gong to signal the adjournment hour?
Though we may be unable to restore these things, there are aspects of Peter’s humanity we have a moral burden to preserve and to renew. As the grieving wanes, we should honor his memory by breathing new life into the values for which he stood.
In the loving tributes that followed his death this spring, Peter was described as a “paradox,” an “original,” and a “living contradiction.” Certainly, these descriptions have a point—most of us do not know many black gay New England Republicans, sprung from Canary Island roots but living among Victoriana and Harvardiana and gifts from the British royal family. And yet we should remember Peter for what he would want us to make of his complexity, what it means for our own lives and for the future of the University.
We too can create ourselves. We need not be what we were born as. We too can transcend categories. Our immutable characteristics do not define our identities, and our skin and bones need not encumber our souls. Peter’s mother proudly used the term “Freesies” for the freed slaves from whom she was descended. We too have the freedom to make of ourselves new and original creatures—new individuals, not representatives of our factions and kin groups.
Education is hard but liberating work. What frees us today, from the snares of expectations that society has set for us or that we have set for ourselves, is the power of learning. Peter credited Bates College, founded as he said by “free will Baptists,” with encouraging his pious independence. He would not endorse the advice one Harvard dean used to give to freshmen: “Don’t let Harvard change you.” No, changing us is exactly what education is supposed to do.
Peter’s lesson at an opening-of-term service some fifteen years ago, remembered perfectly by one of those there to hear it the day after move-in, was the Hebrews’ moaning to Moses about the suffering he was causing. “And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger." Just as the Hebrews eventually thanked Moses, Peter preached to the freshmen, so too would they ultimately appreciate the privations Harvard would soon impose. Then addressing the parents, he added, “And so, get in your cars, and go.” They could return to pick up their offspring, he went on, four years later when Harvard had done its job.
Words matter. Twitter and texting were not part of Peter’s life. At those Sparks House teas, he and his guests did not ignore each other to attend to their smart phones. His appearance with Stephen Colbert was brilliant, but he was not a “new media” figure. Only words mattered, spoken or written, but always in full, grammatical sentences, beautiful to read and even more beautiful to hear. For all his love of object collecting, Peter knew that only his words would survive him. And so we who loved him, let us pledge in his honor: Excellent language matters. Respect words. No more sloppy grammar, wooden prose, bureaucratic obfuscation, graceless consultant-ese, or illogical rhetoric.
Communities, including the University, have moral purpose. My first serious conversation with Peter was at a dinner at my house in 1976, occasioned by Harvard’s invitation to my colleague Bill Bossert to become Master of Lowell House. At that event, the wisdom of Lowell’s plan started to pass in retrograde from the 33-year-old Plymothian to the somewhat more senior Master-elect. We picked up the conversation in 1994, when Peter and I served together on a committee on the structure of Harvard College. Our report quoted Lowell’s words for the House system: “a social device for a moral purpose.” Peter relished the irony that it had fallen to him, whom Mr. Lowell would surely not have chosen to represent Harvard’s moral purpose, to give it voice.
Harvard’s moral opportunities and failings were always within Peter’s view of university affairs. He had faith in human self-improvement, but believed with equal confidence in the power of our institutions to shape us. He hoped for “moral vision” in Harvard’s leadership out of love for the University and for her students, and out of hope, as he would say, that “our best years are ahead of us.” In his memory, let us make them so.

The passage of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as the ACA) was a watershed moment in U.S. health policy. Accomplishing what earlier generations of presidents and legislative advocates had failed to achieve required both adept policy-making and political skills. The most significant result of this legislation was the construction of a framework for universal coverage that builds on the existing array of public and private insurance programs that Americans have relied on for decades (some longer). Numerous implementation challenges yet to be addressed will determine how close to universal Americans’ health insurance coverage will be by the end of the decade. Nonetheless, setting forth the principles and mechanisms of coverage in legislation was a giant step toward greater equity of financial access to health care in the United States.
Countless compromises were required to gain sufficient support for a universal health insurance coverage bill. Among other things, the ACA has been criticized for doing too little to change the health care system in ways that would control the growth in spending and improve the quality and safety of patient care. But surely this was no accident. The coalitions necessary to gain passage of the bill would not have common ground in alternative cost control and delivery system reforms, particularly since many key groups that supported the ACA were provider and consumer organizations.
In the end, federal legislators prioritized coverage—through regulatory reform of health insurance markets, mandates, subsidies, and Medicaid expansion—over much-needed cost control and delivery reform. A similar approach was taken in Massachusetts, albeit in a more favorable economic climate. Advocates of health reform in the federal government, like those in Massachusetts, gambled that once voters and other stakeholders had experience with universal coverage they would be reluctant to let it unravel, even in difficult economic circumstances. And thus if universal coverage were threatened by fragmentation, inefficient delivery models, and a dysfunctional payment system, it would become easier to gain political support to overcome these thorny problems. To date, this gamble appears to have paid off in Massachusetts.  Roughly 98 percent of Massachusetts’ citizens have insurance coverage and while there is disagreement about the specific policies that should be pursued to reduce spending growth, most interest groups, including providers, support the idea that delivery system reform is needed to maintain affordable and universal coverage in the Commonwealth.
A very different picture has emerged in the wake of the ACA’s passage. For a variety of reasons (most of which are budgetary), many of the key provisions of the ACA will not be fully implemented for several years. So that means there are relatively few voters or other stakeholders who have experienced a benefit from the ACA at this point. Many citizens in fact remain ignorant about central provisions of the ACA. And since the ACA was enacted, the economic and federal budget crises have taken center stage. Add federal politics to the mix of no active constituency and general belt-tightening, and the future of the ACA looks increasingly fragile. Legislation sponsored by Congressman Paul Ryan that effectively eliminates the key coverage provisions of the ACA has already been passed by the House of Representatives. This legislation, which also eliminates the defined benefit structure of Medicare and replaces it with a defined contribution, was framed almost entirely in terms of deficit reduction, with little mention of the critical health policy issues at stake.
The Obama administration has been clear that it intends to defend the ACA and address cost control by tackling the underlying problems that lead to spiraling health care spending—provider payment, lack of care coordination, and other gaps in the delivery system. Policy reforms in these areas are being tested and implemented in Medicare and Medicaid, in part as a result of other ACA provisions. It will be critical that credible progress is made on these issues not only to avert future budget crises but also to show that withdrawing the federal government’s commitment to universal coverage—through the ACA, through existing Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare programs—is not the only way to answer the need to moderate federal health care spending. Using the power of the federal government to reform health-care delivery in ways that ensure future affordability is a choice with very different consequences from simply capping the amount the federal government will pay for Medicare and Medicaid and leaving cost control to individual beneficiaries and the states (which the Ryan bill does in order to guarantee lower federal health care spending).
A complex balance of economic and political factors made it possible for President Obama to sign the ACA into law on March 23. Now another array of forces threatens to undermine the central provisions of that law even before most Americans understand how it will affect them and their fellow citizens. The challenge for Democrats and other advocates of health care reform is to communicate more effectively the benefits from the ACA and reveal the false dichotomy offered by opponents: deficit reduction vs. preserving the ideals of universal coverage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of what we think about genocide must be rethought.
First, the magnitude of the problem is far greater than people realize. During our time—that is, the last hundred years—many more people have died at the hands of genocidal killers than during conventional military operations. The number is more than 100 million people slaughtered, and perhaps far more. This stunning fact, which is unknown to virtually everyone, should become basic knowledge to people across the globe. It should change the way we view the world, international security discussions, and policy making, and it should transform the prevention of genocide from a second or third order problem into what it is—an acute necessity to stop the central problem of lethal violence in the world today.
Second, genocide, as horrific as it is, is not even the core problem. Genocide, or mass extermination, is the manifestation of a more fundamental phenomenon called eliminationism. Eliminationism is an orientation and set of policies that seek to do just what it sounds like: eliminate unwanted or hated groups of people. When an eliminationist assault begins, the perpetrators use a variety of eliminationist means, which include the prevention of a group’s reproduction, violent suppression, incarceration in camps, forced transformation (such as religious conversion), expulsion, and mass killing, to achieve their goals. When seen this way, the problem of eliminationism—which is not even recognized for what it is by the international community—becomes even larger and a more pressing concern than the already gargantuan problem of its exterminationist variant, known as genocide.
Third, mass elimination and extermination occur when two factors come together—a populace that harbors eliminationist beliefs and political leaders who choose to turn eliminationism into the centerpiece of their politics. Eliminationist beliefs are prejudices and hatreds that suggest to people that the targeted group or groups pose an obstacle or threat to their cherished goals or well-being and that they would be better off if they were somehow rid of such groups.
As the historical record shows, such beliefs are a necessary prerequisite for genocidal onslaughts because it is extraordinarily difficult for regimes to mobilize a large number of people to commit and support the mass slaughter of others, especially children, if they view those actions as grave crimes that violate their deepest moral principles, which is how everyone sees these acts if they do not share eliminationist beliefs. When political leaders decide that the time has come to unleash an eliminationist and exterminationist onslaught—with predisposed followers if not their country’s or its dominant group’s general populace supporting such an initiative—they have found that eliminationist policies are easy to implement. This happened for the Holocaust, in 1975 in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere, in 1994 in Rwanda, and over the last two decades by the Sudanese Political Islamists first in Southern Sudan and then in Darfur.
Fourth, as this implies, eliminationist and exterminationist assaults are not inevitable, and they are not some sort of human volcanic eruption that just happen because of irrepressible so-called “ancient hatreds.” Eliminationism is a form of politics enacted by political leaderships to achieve expressly, if varying, political goals. Indeed, eliminationist assaults are almost always initiated by the decision of one leader or a small leadership. Hitler gave the order to exterminate European Jews and many others. Pol Pot decided to slaughter a huge number of Cambodians and turn much of the country into a vast concentration camp. Théonesta Bagosora and a few others initiated the Hutu’s systematic mass extermination of the Tutsi in Rwanda. Slobodan Miloševic initiated among the Serbs various eliminationist assaults, including the three-year-long assault on the Bosniaks. And Omar al-Bashir has led the two exterminationist assaults in Sudan that have lasted more than two decades. None of these decisions to eliminate and exterminate defenseless men, women, and children had to be made. In every instance, the political leaders could have decided otherwise, and, had they, hundreds of thousands, millions, sometimes, tens of millions of people—including so many children—would not have died brutal and cruel deaths.
Knowing that eliminationist and exterminationist assaults are not inevitable—but are available for discretionary use by political leaders as part of the standard repertoire of dictatorial regimes—suggests that we need no longer throw our hands up in despair, asking what can we do as mass slaughter has visited the world since time immemorial. And we no longer may pretend, as our political leaders have, that we are taken by surprise when eliminationist assaults occur again. They are a widespread and systemically produced form of politics—systematic because the international community, with its hands-off policies, permits instead of inhibits genocide and actively or tacitly promotes it by legitimizing eliminationist regimes. So we need to fashion systemic policies that change the incentive structure political leaders face when contemplating eliminationist politics. Until now, eliminationism has been a successful form of politics. That is why leaders opt for it. We must, by guaranteeing that they themselves will lose power and be put on trial or killed, make them decide that eliminating and exterminating their self-conceived enemies is not worth it, that they will not succeed, and that they must find other, non-eliminationist “solutions” to their self-conceived, and often self-created “problems.”  If the powerful countries of the west wanted to do this, with all their economic, diplomatic, and military might, constructing such a system would not be difficult.
At stake are millions of lives. How can we stand by yet again and watch innocent people—children, women, and men—be slaughtered by the tens or hundreds of thousands?

In the spring of 2012, France will elect a new president. The incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, is currently at a low ebb in the polls, with an approval rating hovering around 25 percent. Until Saturday, May 14, it therefore seemed likely that the next president of France would come from the principal opposition party, the Socialists (PS). But with the news that the leading PS candidate, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was arrested in New York that night on sexual assault charges, the political landscape changed literally overnight. It was an “earthquake,” one newspaper wrote.
Any number of Socialists now find themselves in a position to make a credible bid for the party’s nomination, which is to be decided in an October primary. The best-placed in early polling is former party leader François Hollande, but he will likely be challenged by the present leader, Martine Aubry; the candidate who lost to Sarkozy in 2007, Ségolène Royal; and several others.
The French political landscape had already been transformed, however, even before the bombshell from New York. Sarkozy’s precipitous decline in popularity is one visible manifestation of a more ominous phenomenon: the rise of populist parties of the extreme right and left. The xenophobic, anti-immigrant National Front has scored as high as 32 percent in some recent polls, while the Left Front polls around 7 or 8 percent. At a minimum, in other words, some 40 percent of the French electorate is rejecting the mainstream parties of the right, left, and center. That is cause for alarm.
In 2007, Sarkozy took a tough line on law and order and immigration control and managed to win back some voters who had deserted the center-right for the Front National in 2002. In that year, Jean-Marie Le Pen shocked France by obtaining 16.86 percent of the first-round presidential vote against only 16.16 percent for Socialist Lionel Jospin. Since only the top two finishers in the first round go on to the second, Jospin was eliminated. Sarkozy wagered that his hard line on “security” issues would win back ethnically French working-class voters who had gone over to the Front, and in 2007 he reduced Le Pen’s vote to just over 10 percent. The Front National was thought to be finished.
When the economic crisis hit in 2008, however, many who had deserted the Front National in the election decided they had had enough of Sarkozy’s mildly neoliberal economic reforms. The president’s staunch support for the European Union, whose rules and regulations impose tight constraints on the ability of member states to respond to high unemployment, played into the hands of the Front’s new leader, Marine Le Pen, the daughter of Jean-Marie. She has softened the party’s image by recasting her father’s overtly xenophobic rhetoric as a defense of the French republican tradition of strict secularism in the public sphere, a tradition that she claims is threatened by France’s growing Muslim minority. Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has enjoyed surprising success since leaving the Socialist Party, to whose left wing he belonged for years, and organizing a new Left Party, which has now joined with the rump of the Communist Party to form the Left Front.
This large populist vote should send a powerful message to what the French like to call “the political class,” meaning the politicians, journalists, pundits, experts, civil servants, and intellectuals who monopolize public debate and make policy. To be sure, France is not exceptional in this respect. Large contingents of voters in many countries have registered acute disappointment with the leadership of their elites. But in France this disappointment has been a persistent feature of the political culture for nearly two decades.
Interestingly, the International Monetary Fund loomed large in the rhetoric of both the National Front and the Left Front, perhaps because Strauss-Kahn until his arrest both headed that organization and seemed likely to be the Socialist candidate. Le Pen denounced what she called the IMF’s “deadly dogmas,” while Mélenchon referred to Strauss-Kahn as “a starver of nations.” Of course it was convenient to use the IMF as a symbol, because it was headed by a man who was expected to be the Socialists’ strongest candidate. The ultimate targets are globalization and the European Union, to which there is substantial opposition in France, as the “no” vote on the 2005 constitutional treaty demonstrated.
President Sarkozy reportedly told a private meeting of leading members of his party that the Socialists had lost “the morality battle” because of Strauss-Kahn’s behavior. But he forgets that he was the one who recommended Strauss-Kahn to the IMF in the first place. The voters already disaffected from the “political class” because they believe that it is arrogant, distant, and insensitive to their problems will only take the events in New York as evidence that the powerful believe they can get away with anything. Since more than two of every five French citizens now reject the establishment parties, a full-blown “crisis of legitimation” is at hand. That is a dangerous moment for any country. It wouldn’t take much—a debt default in Europe’s periphery, say, triggering bank failures in France and Germany—to bring the whole system to a halt and open the door to the worst political dangers. We live in interesting times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard Feynman, the late Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist, was famously curious about how the physical world worked.  He turned his curiosity into a career and was richly rewarded for it. For Feynman, the reward was not monetary, nor was it the accolades of his colleagues.  His reward was, in his own words, “the pleasure of finding things out.”
Feynman’s path is not unique.  Uncommon talent coupled with a real desire for knowledge is a powerful combination, and the best writers, artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs all have talent and curiosity.
Is curiosity a luxury most of us can’t afford, as we must bear down on demanding class work or our jobs?  Indeed, curiosity can cost you.  Suppose something catches your attention in class, and you spend hours or days trying to actually understand it, as opposed to the usual descriptive understanding.  Like a rat in a lab cage, you are soon administered a shock for stepping outside your assigned routine: you have not optimized your study time. Yet such devotion to something that interests you is the path to discovery, and best way to learn in the long run. Classes which have self-motivated student projects (with lots of faculty consultation available) are a step ahead in the right direction, but they are not sufficient.
It is the University’s job to foster and reward curiosity; satisfying curiosity is a far more positive experience than cramming for an exam. Think back on your best teachers. I bet you will agree they had a talent for inducing curiosity in subjects you never thought you would care about.
Harvard is taking steps in the right direction, encouraging its professors to offer courses relevant to life after college. That is indeed one of the ways to foster curiosity. Most of us are naturally more curious about how to formulate an energy policy that makes sense than we are about, say, entropy, but there are professors of chemistry at Harvard who can make you desperate to understand entropy,  in order to better understand the energy crisis .  Many other new Ged Ed offerings have been hatched with great care and with a mandate for relevance.  I am frankly proud of the effort Harvard is making to improve undergraduate education.
Nobody would deny that we have a long way to go.  It is still way too easy to fall into the teacher-student covenant: Students are working for a grade, anxious to know exactly what they have to do to get an A, and unhappy if that pathway is somewhat hazy.  Professors don’t like unhappy students, so they usually oblige, with the familiar sorts of lecture format, exams, and homework assignments, etc.
“This won’t be on the exam” is the surest way to get students to switch to Facebook on their open laptops.  What a shame! What if you really wanted to know, even if it wasn’t going to be on the exam?  This is exactly where I think Harvard is trying to go, although not every faculty member is on board, nor could you expect 100percent buy-in.
Students aren’t about to give up their interest in grades, especially at Harvard, where so many highly motivated students depend on them to land positions in the best jobs, medical schools, and graduate schools.  The solution? Reward curiosity! This is hard to do on a written exam.  It will take a larger faculty and more time for each professor spent teaching. I see this as our solemn duty, because an education which fosters curiosity and the critical thinking to go along with it lasts a lifetime.
Of course I have my pet solutions. Above I said “It is the University’s job to foster and reward curiosity.”  That applies to faculty too! I would love to see more incentives (there are some already, to be sure) for faculty members who are  curious about the process of teaching.  What if the University set up semester long workshops for faculty, complete with guest experts, best practices, case studies, video feedback, student feedback, etc. All faculty would be asked to enroll at some point.  Yes, I hear the collective groans of some of my colleagues.  The University would need to “incentivize” the workshops somehow.  That shouldn’t be difficult if the University is really committed to fostering this kind of academic growth.
The University should also think hard about admissions criteria.  Curiosity is not the same as achievement, test scores, and even good recommendations.   The truly curious have the most to gain from a Harvard education, and Harvard has the most to gain from them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few minutes after waking up on Commencement Day, Gerald C. Tiu ’10 went online to look at his transcript.
Tiu had only an hour left before he was expected to line up for the ceremony, and he still had not checked whether he had earned Latin honors—the College’s recognition of academic excellence in the top fifty percent of the graduating class.
Although Tiu had received good grades as a chemical and physical biology concentrator in his four years at Harvard, he had not heard anything about Latin Honors from his resident dean or even given the matter much thought.
But when his transcript loaded, Tiu discovered that he had been named summa cum laude, the highest Latin honor at the College, reserved for the very top of the graduating class—a total of 76 students in the Class of 2010.
For Tiu, the moment was far from remarkable.
Although he was proud of the hard work he had put into his courses and extracurricular activities at Harvard, he  was “not necessarily proud” of being summa cum laude.
When Tiu applied to M.D.-Ph.D. programs during his post-graduate year, he did not talk about receiving summa in his interviews.
He did not even tell his parents about the honor—it only came up when they noticed it on his degree.
According to a joking Tiu, it was only on the day of Commencement, just a few hours after learning that he had received the distinction, that summa cum laude paid off in the form of front row seats at the ceremony.
For Tiu and many other students who receive the accolade, Latin honors are often no more than an intangible recognition of their hard work at Harvard.
But among many students who actively strive to attain the stellar grades necessary to graduate summa cum laude, the competition is fierce—leading some students to take easy courses to keep their grade point averages high rather than challenging themselves with difficult courses in which they might not earn an ‘A.’
After several changes to Latin honors designed to standardize the process, some faculty members are advocating further reform of what they say is a flawed system.
“If it was up to me, we’d get rid of [Latin honors],” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris says. “I don’t think they accomplish anything.”
STANDARDIZING AN ARBITRARY SYSTEM
This past February at a Faculty meeting, Harris made two proposals to reform Latin honors that were approved in a vote by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences later that month and will be implemented beginning with the Class of 2012.
Harris’s first proposal reformed the selection process by lowering the threshold for summa cum laude candidates from a rate that varied annually between the top four and five percent of students recommended by their concentrations to a fixed rate of five percent.
The change was motivated by what he saw as the “arbitrary feel” of the existing selection system, in which a committee analyzes the GPA data each year to set a minimum threshold within the allocated range.
“If it’s shifting from one year to the next based on where we think we see a gap, it just didn’t feel right to a number of us,” he says.
While Harris admits that the new threshold of five percent is also somewhat arbitrary, he says he thinks the fixed percentage is “clean” and “doesn’t require negotiation.”
Harris also proposed that the distribution requirement—which mandates that students receive at least two A-level grades each in the humanities, the social sciences, and the sciences—be eliminated.
Harris says that the change was prompted by the difficulty of classifying courses within the three categories—a challenge that has been exacerbated by the influx of interdisciplinary courses in the new General Education program.
The reforms come as the latest in a series of minor alterations to a Latin honors system that has stayed largely consistent since its inception after the Civil War. The College has awarded its graduates the highest honor of summa cum laude, followed by magna cum laude, and finally cum laude since the late 19th century.
OPENING UP THE CONVERSATION
In its present incarnation, the honors system has been critiqued by those who say that it fails to reflect the spirit of academic exploration that the College hopes to encourage.
While the changes Harris proposed aim to standardize the system, they do not address the larger question of educational philosophy that Professor of computer science Harry R. Lewis ’68—a former Dean of the College—believes should be raised.
Lewis has criticized the attention paid to GPA and Latin honors on campus, which he says inspires “profoundly anti-educational” behavior among students.
“[The system] incentivizes people when they have a choice between a course they know something about and a course they know nothing about to take the course they already know something about,” he says. “It completely defeats the point of going to college and getting an education.”
Harris echoes Lewis’s sentiment, saying he does not think Latin honors serve a “truly positive purpose.”
“It’s not clear to me that any honors systems actually provide incentives or the ones we’d want,” Harris says.
To solve this problem, Lewis says he believes a campus-wide conversation needs to be launched.
“It kills me to see people compromising, just loafing through their senior year, taking half their courses pass-fail,” he says. “There’s a discourse that’s missing in the air here about what the purpose of an education is.”
He recalls suggesting at a recent Faculty meeting that the College could post a list of three books for students to read over winter break and follow-up with faculty panel discussions of the texts during January Term.
In a program like this, he says, “You’re not going to get any gold stars. It’s not going to go on a special certificate that you did it. You just did it because reading books is a good thing to do.”
EMBRACING INERTIA
But even with initiatives like the one Lewis suggested, some believe that the problems created by the intense focus on grades and GPA will persist.
Though Harris says he would support eliminating Latin honors entirely, he has no intention of bringing the issue forward because he says it is low priority and acknowledges that tradition-steeped systems like Latin honors tend to “run on inertia.”
Despite his criticism of Latin honors, Lewis—who describes himself as a “traditionalist”—says he thinks the system should stay in place.
While he says there is implicit unfairness in a system that can reward students for avoiding risks, he thinks this drawback is mitigated by the fact that a summa degree “isn’t actually worth anything.”
Daniel E. Lieberman, who as chair of the Human Evolutionary Biology department, usually recommends about half of his fifty graduating HEB concentrators for summa cum laude, agrees.
“This is Harvard. We don’t get rid of things,” he says. “We’re always going to try to celebrate students who achieve academically. And there’s nothing wrong with that.”

In spite of all the hoopla about the U.S. having “the best healthcare in the world”, the dirty little secret is that we don’t. By virtually every measure, the quality of our healthcare is inferior to that of Europeans, Canadians, and Australians, and we pay twice as much. In addition, millions are left without insurance coverage. That, of course, is what the Affordable Care Act (health reform) is all about. And, despite the disinformation and political posturing, that is still what it is about.
Ironically, the poor quality of our healthcare is also the reason it costs so much. Conversely, improving quality is how we can bring costs under control. In fact, it is the only voluntary way we can bring costs under control, and we need to get at it with some sense of urgency.
Our quality problem consists of both waste and inappropriate use of healthcare services. Former Secretary of the Treasury and President of Alcoa, Paul O’Neill believes that administrative and service waste account for 50percent of health care costs. Even conservative experts agree it is at least 25 percent.
Health insurance companies are the prime generators of administrative waste, estimated at 10percent of premiums, primarily through “churning”: the practice of routinely rejecting and requiring resubmission of claims. This is then matched by further waste by the physician’s office resubmitting the bills. Even an office of two practitioners needs a full time person to process bills.
Service waste includes all the inefficiencies we take for granted in health care: duplicating missing tests, x-rays, MRIs, etc., repeating histories, rescheduling, time wasted looking for missing records, equipment and supplies, and, of course, ubiquitous waiting. Another 25 percent.
Inappropriate care accounts for 25-30 percent of health care expenses. At least 30percent of tests and treatments have been shown to be unnecessary – and, therefore, potentially harmful. Conversely, a large study showed that nearly half of Americans fail to receive care that would help them (underuse). Perhaps the most serious underuse is of preventive services, especially aggressive treatment of patients with chronic diseases, like diabetes, to prevent expensive and life-threatening complications. Fewer than half of these, our sickest patients, get the quality of care we know how to give. Because they consume 70 percent of our health care expenditures, providing appropriate care to all of them would save 1000’s of lives and $100’s of billions.
Harm caused by treatment mishaps, such as medication mix-ups and hospital-acquired infections, is the third type of inappropriate care. It adds up to more than a million injuries a year, tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths, and costs of 10’s of billions of dollars annually. Yet impressive gains have been made by some hospitals in eliminating infections and reducing surgical complications and deaths. All hospitals can do it.
The opportunities to dramatically improve the quality of health care are vast. We know how to address all of these quality problems.
But we don’t do it. Why?  Because our fee-for-service payment system offers perverse incentives: it pays more for individual services and less for coordinated, team-based and preventive care. It pays more for doing more, not for doing better.
Under our system, hospitals and doctors only get paid for what they do, whether necessary or unnecessary. They get paid for tests and procedures, and for complications. They make less money when they provide better care that keeps their diabetic and asthma patients out of the hospital. They get paid for specialty care, but not for team care or the coordination needed to manage patients with chronic diseases. If we want to raise quality and lower costs, that has to change.
Amid all the contention and misinformation about the Affordable Care Act, one fact stands out: it alone has the potential to bring about the changes we need to improve quality and cut costs. It includes funds and directives to Medicare for expanding the availability of Accountable Care Organizations. These are healthcare organizations that, for a fixed annual fee, take responsibility for meeting all the health needs of a population – prevention, acute care, emergency care, complex care, wherever it is given. By giving the doctors in the ACO the responsibility for wisely using resources, it gives them the financial incentives to provide care that minimizes complications from disease and keeps patients out of the hospital. It puts the emphasis on value, not on volume.
Will it be smooth or easy? Of course not. Moving from a highly-entrenched system that handsomely rewards hospitals and caregivers for volume to an efficient system that rewards quality will be slow and difficult. But the process has begun. We know a lot about how to do this, and we will learn more as we go. But, if you are still skeptical, consider this: we have no “Plan B”.

One of the most revealing things about the recently released trove of Guantánamo documents was the Obama administration’s response to it: “Both the previous and the current Administrations have made every effort to act with the utmost care and diligence in transferring detainees from Guantanamo,” Pentagon and State Department officials jointly remarked. “Both administrations have made the protection of American citizens the top priority and we are concerned that the disclosure of these documents could be damaging to those efforts.”
Thus the president who made opposition to Bush administration national security policy and a pledge to close Guantánamo a hallmark of his 2008 election campaign sought to shield himself from criticism of his ongoing use of the prison by aligning himself with his predecessor.
And no wonder. The Guantánamo prison camp enjoys more public and political support today than at any time in its ten-year history. In poll after poll taken since President Obama took office, the American public has overwhelmingly rejected the idea of closing the prison and transferring its population stateside, most recently in December 2010. That same month, a Democratic Congress dealt a near-fatal blow to the administration’s effort to close the prison by prohibiting the President from transferring detainees to the United States and from repatriating detainees without the signature of the Secretary of Defense—provisions enacted without parliamentary debate and virtually without public notice. The President’s recent capitulation on the prison only confirms what the polls and politicians have been telling us for the last several years: we are all Guantánamo now.
In fact, Guantánamo has played a pivotal role in American history going back before the U.S. was even a country. The record of America’s long involvement at Guantánamo Bay calls into question the popular notion that post 9/11 Guantánamo represents a fall from grace at the same time that it illuminates a fundamental paradox at the heart of American national identity between liberty and coercion.
Since its beginning as a cluster of colonies, the United States has been an expansionist, global juggernaut in the making. The occupation of Guantánamo in 1898 fulfilled a yearning for an American foothold in Cuba dating back to the colonial era. Guantánamo was the first fruit of a harvest of territories, resources, and markets thought to be essential to U.S. prosperity and to the liberal democratic principles prosperity guaranteed.
We may never know for sure who the first North American was to set eyes on the bay, but American colonists attended the successful British assault on Guantánamo of 1741. Mount Vernon, the nation’s venerated civic shrine, is named after the British admiral that George Washington’s half brother Lawrence served with in Guantánamo for three months that summer. Thereafter Americans would keep Guantánamo closely in sight, constrained by exigency if not etiquette from intervening in Cuba’s protracted battle for independence until the U.S.S Maine blew up in Havana harbor in early 1898.
The ensuing U.S. century at Guantánamo has consisted of periods of relative calm punctuated by fierce activity and hasty adaptation to unfolding global crises. The quiet and underused coaling station from which the U.S. strode triumphantly onto the global stage at the turn of the twentieth century scarcely resembled the boisterous depot to which the Fleet repaired for fuel and refreshment during Prohibition. Prohibition-era Guantánamo, in turn, little resembled the base at which Batista’s pilots refueled in their battle against the Cuban resistance. Nor did the Guantánamo that accommodated Batista in the late 1950s much resemble that dangled by Kennedy in an attempt to bait Castro into war just a few years later. Finally, Kennedy’s Guantánamo differed markedly from the Guantánamo of presidents Carter and Reagan, which appeared so outdated by the 1970s and 80s that both men contemplated returning the base to Cuba. Only in the last decade or so has Guantánamo’s role begun to settle out. Guantánamo has become the place to hold refugees (over 85,000 Cubans and Haitians under the Bush and Clinton administrations in the 1990s) and prisoners of war—a never-never land within US jurisdiction yet beyond the rule of law.
The Guantánamo prison camp lies along the Cuban coastline, separated from the hub of naval activity by a range of hills. Navy folks like to think of their side of the hills as the “real Guantánamo” (sometimes the “good Guantánamo”), leaving the visitor to conclude what he or she may about the prison. But the prison wouldn’t be there without the Navy. And the Navy wouldn’t be there without the U.S. government’s decision to retain the bay at the end of the war with Spain. Finally, none of this would be there today without the tacit consent of the American people whose standard of living the U.S. government and military is sworn to protect. Up close, a chasm seems to separate Americans who, apparently for the first time in the nation’s history, tried to write torture into U.S. law from those who reject torture unconditionally. But through the lens of history, the differences blur, and Americans become one people, just as Guantánamo becomes one bay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
I remember landing early evening in Cairo on June 13, 1973 as though it were yesterday, the sun still shining, the air hot and dusty. I remember packed buses transporting us to the terminal. Entering, we passed by what seemed like an army of soldiers casually brandishing old rifles and flashing friendly smiles of welcome. I thought of Egypt’s former president, the firebrand Gamal Abdel Nasser, of my political science classes and wondered what he would have thought of his troops at that moment.
I was one of fifty American students who came to Egypt to study Arabic at the American University in Cairo. I remember the battalion of American University of Cairo officials who came to greet us. But, before we could reach them on the other side of the airport, we had to undergo initiation into the infamous sci-fi-esque labyrinth of Egyptian bureaucracy, procuring endless visas and clearing customs. Many entries into Egypt since that day convinced me how lucky we were to be met and assisted by the AUC expeditors who came with a welcoming hand.
Assembled at the exit after clearing customs and retrieving luggage, I noticed that the sun had set at last. The sky was a deep dark blue, but out to the horizon lay vast expanses of dark desert. We boarded a bus with no air conditioning. We sat in silence, exhausted but excited. Our decrepit bus reminded me of the lean, emaciated she-camels I read about in my Arabic literature classes which the ancient poets of Arabia elaborately described during their long night journeys through the desert.
In fact, most of what I knew and expected came from language, literature, religion, and government classes I took at Georgetown as an Arabic major. But what I came to encounter that next morning, and all those months that followed that first evening, bore little resemblance to the images in my textbooks. Of course, nothing was mentioned about the traffic, about donkey carts and old Peugeots bumping into each other on the main streets, or the flocks of sheep and even the occasional camel that stopped cars and pedestrians during rush hour. Nearly every corner of downtown Cairo had fruit and vegetable vendors selling produce brought in each morning from villages. Most Americans at that time weren’t ready for Cairo’s many aspects of life that could justifiably, but offensively, be termed “pre-modern.”  The small tin of Nescafe coffee was just about the only imported commodity in the market, and the newspapers and magazines sold at corner kiosks were local, with an occasional Time or Newsweek popping up here or there, frayed at the ages from being read and passed from hand to hand. Television and radio were local, and my months as a student during the Arab-Israeli 1973 War made me appreciate for the first time the joys of a free press.  We had read so much about Nasser, but everywhere we turned we saw photos of President Anwar Sadat, gracing the walls of government offices, restaurants, and cafes. We were never allowed to forget where we were and who was in change.  Life for us was uncomplicated in many ways, innocent, romantic, as long as we remained bitten by the Arabic bug, the metaphor we used at Georgetown for those of us who fell in love with Arabic and swooned over its language and culture. Orientalism à la Edward Said, perhaps, but we were gleefully smitten.
My thoughts today turn to my students heading this summer to Egypt, Morocco, and Jordan, who will share the same excitement I felt when first landing in the real world of Arabic language and culture. But things have changed. Cairo over the past thirty-something years has witnessed massive urban sprawl, and once outside the airport, my students will immediately see hundreds of new blocks of high rise apartments, shops, cafes, and beauty salons. The vast expanses of desert have been pushed so far back that they will need to crane their necks and look far out into the distance to catch but a mere glimpse of them. When they take their first stroll through Maidan Tahrir, they will find copies of the New York Times, People Magazine, and perhaps a stray copy Wrestlers’ Digest. Above the rooftops they will see flocks of satellite dishes and locally made antennas. The street vendors and donkey carts are nowhere in sight. Gone are the days when Egyptians were restricted to local media to get their news of the world.  And most of all, those photos of Hosni Mubarak looking down in patriarchal severity at his “subjects” have been replaced with banners celebrating the revolution we now call the “Arab Spring.”
My students won’t savor that quaint, “pre-modern,” romantic Cairo I so affectionately recall of summer 1973.  Something really momentous happened this past January, as we all know.  The humpty-dumpty of the old world had its great fall and my students of Arabic will arrive in Cairo (Amman or Fez), and feel the excitement of the unknown, of new faces and images yet to be inscribed into textbooks, of a thriving, throbbing city, still noisy and polluted, but full of pride and hope.  How I, still smitten, envy them in so many, many ways.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a secure glass case in the Memorial Room at the heart of Widener Library—the centerpiece of Harvard’s system of 80 libraries and 16 million volumes—is Harvard’s Gutenberg Bible.
The Gutenberg Bibles, with 21 copies in the world, were the first major volumes printed with a movable type printing press, and they are said to have immeasurably transformed the history of printing.
But 560 years later, books may undergo one of the most aggressive transformations since the printing of those Bibles.
A core of Harvard professors are currently leading a national endeavor to digitize every book in the world—including the Gutenberg Bible—and make them available to every American through an internet-based service called the Digital Public Library of America.
The DPLA, its leaders say, will place the resources of top research libraries in the world in the pocket of every American. They foresee a time when some of the most scarce books are easily accessible to “independent scholars” on their home desktops and smart phones.
“In human history, the concept of a digital library is potentially the greatest revolution in learning since the creation of the university,” says Jim Leach, current chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an agency that represents federal concerns for the advancement of knowledge.
‘A NATIONAL ASSET’
Harvard University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 has an office in the yellow Wadsworth House, constructed in 1726 and home to a long line of the University’s former presidents. His walls are lined with bound volumes, some dating back to the French Revolution, worn but in good condition.
But in conversation, his words project a future in which books are immortalized in ones and zeros.
Darnton is heading up DPLA, a venture that began in October 2010 when he called together leaders from libraries, universities, and the technology world to discuss the possibility of putting all the volumes from America’s biggest research collections online.
Teaming up with Law School Professor John G. Palfrey Jr. ’94 at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Darnton has become the face of a cadre of Harvard professors supporting the project.
The online collection, Darnton says, will build a bridge between people across the country and the treasures that are the nation’s top libraries.
“In my view, the Harvard library is so great that it’s a national asset,” Darnton says. “We wanted to reach out to say it’s meant for American citizens and not just college professors.”
‘THE INTELLECTUAL VOICE’
Darnton, former director of the Harvard University Library, is coming from a perspective of change.
An active member of the former Library Implementation Work Group, he contributed to the most drastic recasting of the University library system in decades.
The reform will consolidate the many libraries at Harvard under a single administrative body, reducing barriers to facilitate access to the Univesity’s full collection.
“It has evolved over the years to truly be complex and labyrinthine,” says University Provost Steve E. Hyman, who oversaw the library redevelopment. “The goal is to make a great library better, to make it more efficient,” he says.
The new structure appoints a Harvard Library Board—a rotating collection of professors from each of the University’s schools—and installs an executive director of the library system.
Helen Shenton, who will serve as the first executive director, says that her charge means that she will coordinate across the University.
“We’re going in a collaborative direction,” Shenton says.
Shenton says Darnton has played a key role in the transformation of the libraries, calling him, as University Librarian, the “intellectual voice of the Harvard Library.”
GOING HIGH TECH
During his tenure, Darnton has already overseen the incorporation of some of the most advanced technology in the field as the library has sought to conserve its most valued volumes.
The library also began preserving its texts in digital form through state-of-the-art scanning machines, taking its first steps into the digitizing its books.
It’s an intensive process—in costs, personnel, and hours.
An archivist must go page-by-page—though some scanning technology can turn the pages automatically—as a camera scans all the images and text on an open spread of a book.
According to Darnton, the scanning of a vast collection like Harvard’s can run in the millions of dollars.
So it seemed like a great deal to Harvard library administrators when Google Inc. asked the University for permission to digitize its books, and would do it for free.
A SHATTERED ALLIANCE
In 2005, the Google Books Library Project approached the Harvard University Library with a proposition. Harvard would join four other research libraries in scanning its books for what Google hoped would become an international online collection under the corporation’s control.
Harvard agreed to take part, and Google proceeded to scan 850,000 of Harvard’s books in the public domain.
The Google Books Library Project represented the most ambitious mission to date to create an online collection. A pet project of Google co-founder Larry Page, it aimed to scan every book in existence.
But Darnton says he began to question what he considered the program’s sloppy workflow. Some famous works were miscategorized—Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” was filed under “Gardening,” he says—and unanticipated costs popped up on Harvard’s balance sheet.
“We spent $1.9 million on the ‘free’ project,” Darnton says.
While scanning is costly, it accounts for only part of the associated costs. For every volume requested by Google, library staff members had to check out the book and make sure it was strong enough to endure the transportation, meticulously cataloging its journey.
Darnton says that when Google pressed for copyrighted books, it crossed a line that would fracture the partnership and set the stage for DPLA.
In October 2008, following a $125 million settlement between Google and the Authors Guild that extended the life of the program, Harvard backed out. Citing legal risks involved in digitizing copyright protected materials, the University announced it would not continue its partnership with Google.
The company spent the next two years defending the new settlement against Justice Department inquiries into possible anti-trust violations.
But the courts said no. In his March 2011 decision, Judge Denny Chin wrote in a statement that the Google Books Library Project would represent a “significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission.” Google is appealing the court decision.
But Harvard faculty and the DPLA steering committee were already underway with the Google Books Library Project’s little cousin.
POST-GOOGLE
As a scholar of the French Revolution, Darnton says he uses “the word ‘revolutionary’ with caution.”
But when referring to the DPLA project, Darnton genuinely calls its mission as “revolutionary as during the Gutenberg period.”
After securing a donation from the Sloan Foundation in December 2010, the DPLA had collected enough capital to enter its planning phase. And with the Library of Congress and Smithsonian Institution’s quick support, the DPLA has garnered a formidable pool from which to draw.
In a March op-ed in the New York Times following Google’s legal setback, Darnton optimistically called on the corporation to contribute the 2 million scanned books in the public domain—of 15 million total—to the DPLA.
“Perhaps Google itself could be enlisted to the cause of the digital public library,” he wrote.
The company has made no such move, but in a statement to The Crimson, Google praised the “vast undertaking” of moving the world’s books online.
“Digitization and preservation initiatives, such as the Digital Public Library of America project, are important for making these books accessible online,” the statement says.
DPLA leaders acknowledge that they are following in the footsteps of the Google Books initiative, but they say they have a very different mission in mind.
Unlike Google’s project, DPLA is non-profit organization—envisioned as  an online public library.
And the distinction, those familiar with the project say, could mean a world of difference in the legal sphere.
“Google Books wasn’t a digital library. Google Books was a digital bookstore,” says Maria A. Pallante, acting register of copyrights in the Library of Congress.
NAVIGATING COPYRIGHT LAW
DPLA has confined itself, in its early stages, to the collection of works in the public domain, hoping for future legislative reform that will open up access to copyrighted material.
Currently, these books represent only a sliver of world literature: Though most works published before 1923 are in the public domain, for works produced after 1923, U.S. copyright law severely limits the available pool.
But DPLA leaders have their sights set on a far larger class of works. Looking for new legislation that will help the online collection include all copyrighted out-of-print works, DPLA leaders say that this reform will allow them to make millions of more books accessible to the public.
If Congress authorizes the type of collective licensing in question, DPLA could move to obtain the rights to works on an entirely new scale, no longer necessitating collectors to examine individual works.
“Collective licensing, this is the piece that I think people are sad to see go from the Google case. This is something that Congress has to legislate,” Pallante says.
While Google failed to forge a legal path—coming under fire for alleged anti-trust violations—DPLA organizers hope that, as a non-profit public library, the law will change for them in the future.
‘SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY’
DPLA is only entering the beginning phases of its execution, and members involved with the project are quick to emphasize that fact.
In September, a beta version of the web interface will go live, and DPLA will begin an 18-month implementation phase in the fall.
“My best hope is that even if it won’t turn out what we exactly expect now, it will turn out to be something extraordinary,” says David Weber, vice president of programs of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
Three months before users are able to peruse the library’s collections, Darnton discusses the project with obvious practice.
But he is careful to stress that this is not Harvard’s “pet project”—rather, it is a mission in which Harvard, as the largest private library system in the world, should participate.
“Part of this is being able to share the extraordinary resources of our libraries much more broadly through digitization processes that we’ve done some of in the last decade or so,” University President Drew G. Faust says. “I think ten years from now ... sitting here, we would be astonished at what had happened.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Advances in genetics, personalized genomics, and gene therapy are getting a lot of attention. The hope—some say fear—is that we will ultimately be able to use medical technology to reshape the genomes of patients, curing ailments by changing somatic genes (thus affecting the life of an individual). Some even hope that we will be able to modify our species for the better by introducing changes into our germline (thus affecting not only an individual, but also all of his or her progeny).
Ethicists hotly debate this topic, arguing the case for, or against, “perfection.” Some question whether we have the right to develop technologies that would allow us to change the human genome. Others say this is not only a right, but actually a duty. After all, if we could develop a genetically based treatment for patients with sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or diabetes, who could object? And who would not want to see farther or live longer?
But overlooked in this debate are the ways in which—just possibly— medical advances may already be changing our genes, at the population level.
It used to be thought that our genes were historically immutable and that it was not possible to imagine a conversation between culture and genetics. It was thought that we as a species evolved over a timescale far too long to be influenced by human actions. But evidence has been mounting for the past decade that we as a species are evolving genetically in real time, under the pressure of discernable social and historical forces.
The best example so far is the evolution of lactose tolerance in adults. The ability of adults to digest lactose confers evolutionary advantages only when a stable supply of milk is available, such as after milk-producing animals (sheep, cattle, goats) have been domesticated. The advantages are several, ranging from a source of valuable energy to a source of necessary hydration during times of water shortage or spoilage.
Amazingly, several adaptive mutations have occurred in widely separated populations in Africa and Europe just over the past 3,000 to 9,000 years, all conferring the ability to digest lactose. These mutations are principally seen in populations of people who are herders and not in nearby populations who have retained a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. This trait is sufficiently advantageous that those with the trait may have many more descendants than those without.
A similar story can be told about relatively recent mutations that confer advantages in terms of surviving epidemic diseases, such as typhoid in Europe. Since these diseases were made more likely when the density of human settlement increased and far-flung trade became possible, here we have another example of how cultural change may affect our genes.
Of course, our biology and our culture have always been in conversation. For example, rising socioeconomic status with industrial development resulted in people becoming taller (a biological effect of a cultural development), and taller people required a change in architecture (a cultural effect of a biological development). Anyone marveling at the small size of beds in medieval houses knows this first hand. But it seems that it is also possible for specifically genetic change to take place over similarly short time periods.
Why does this matter to medicine? Because many of the things we are already doing may be modifying our genes. Maybe we are all more myopic as a result of medieval lens grinders. Maybe our bones are weaker since we have had bone-setting technology for thousands of years. Maybe the changes in survival of patients receiving treatment for all sorts of conditions that are wholly or partly attributable to single or multiple genes (ranging from sickle cell disease to type 1 diabetes) are resulting in changes in the human genome. Maybe the introduction of penicillin and childhood immunization has changed our genes. Some have noted that the number of children with Down’s syndrome is falling in many industrialized societies as a result of selective abortion. With the onset of personal genetics, it is not hard to imagine this being taken a step further. Medical technology might change our genes indeed.
Advances in medical technology are not the only things doing this in ways relevant to health and wellbeing. There may be genetic variants that favor survival in cities, or that confer a preference for complicated social networks, or that foster altruistic behavior consistent with living in a more democratic society. Maybe even the more complex world we live in nowadays really is making us smarter.
Unfortunately, this also means that particular ways of living and particular medical technologies could create advantages for some but not all members of our species. Certain groups might acquire (admittedly, over centuries) certain advantages. The idea that the application of medical technology can modify what kind of offspring we have is thus as troubling as it is amazing.
Realizing the ways in which we humans may have been inadvertently changing our genes for millennia provides a way for us to begin to think about the inevitable genetic revolution in medicine that is going to allow us to advertently change our genes over centuries and even decades.

A peek inside the bound volumes of The Crimson shows how a picture of life at Harvard in 1910 very different from the Harvard experience one hundred years later. Rising seniors, for example, applied for housing in Holworthy, Hollis, and Thayer for their final year at Harvard — and shortly afterwards, everyone's rooming assignments were posted on  the front page of The Crimson.
Football also dominated the headlines of the daily newspaper. The Crimson followed the Harvard team in great detail, covering blow-by-blow not only every game of the season but also everything from coaching styles to future prospects. At the annual Harvard-Yale Game, the two teams tied at 0-0.
The 1910-1911 academic year was also one that saw a number of world-renowned figures come to Harvard. Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, delivered a lecture in Sanders entitled "Applied Morality," supporting the United States' work on the Panama Canal and the country's efforts towards conservation. And that spring, William Jennings Bryan, the soon-to-be Secretary of State famous for his 1896 "Cross of Gold" speech, gave a talk  about the importance of strong oratory in the growth of democracy.
Meanwhile, on regular school nights, students looked for ways to take a break from schoolwork, much as they do now. While Brain Break had yet to become a tradition, "smokers," tobacco-infused social gatherings, were a fairly common informal social occasion for the Harvard student, and were often assembled by dormitory proctors themselves.
But more elaborate social gatherings also fostered a sense of community among students. In June, a Harbor Party was held for seniors, and an excerpt from the announcement in The Crimson describes what would have went down that day:
"With their drinking cups clasped in their soft little fingers, their pudgy little maulers clutching the tin tubas, and their pretty childish prattle fascinating the motherly bystanders, the Seniors will Subway to Park and thence to the Broad and Wide Way that leadeth to the berth of King Philip."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you don’t count the ’Cliffies serving lunch—one of whom later headed a major Hollywood studio—there were no women in the Signet when I became president in 1970.
Actually there were almost no undergraduate members at all. The war in Vietnam cast a shadow on Cambridge. Automatic student deferments had been abolished, and only a lucky lottery number stood between Harvard men and the draft. Storybook life in the Yard had given way to a stormy succession of protests, strikes, occupations, busts, tear gas, wrenching debates, bitter confrontations with University leadership, and trashed and boarded-up windows on Mass. Ave. and Mt. Auburn Street: hardly a friendly climate for sherry sipping, lit’ry lunches and aspirational roses. The number of incoming Signet members in each new cohort skittered close to zero. At one dismal election, I recall someone asking, “What is the point?” Recourse to answers like Shelley’s—“Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world”—seemed haplessly inadequate.
Not only did the Signet appear to be blithely irrelevant to the moral churning in the larger world; it seemed out of touch even with the change occurring at Harvard. In my freshman year, we Harvard men had to wear coats and ties to meals. When women came as dinner guests to the Freshman Union (now the Barker Center), a wave of fork-on-water-glass clinking—Look! A woman!—would sweep the room. When women visited us in our dorm rooms, it was only during strict “parietal hours,” a few days a week, doors open—and keep three feet on the floor, please. The Houses were all all-male.
But by my junior year, some of the Houses were conducting “experiments” in co-residential living, and some intrepid Harvard men opted to move to Radcliffe. I was on The Crimson; they had women editors.  I was on The Advocate; they had women editors.  It struck me that the least the Signet could do to shake off its somnolence and notice the revolution beyond its Dunster Street door was to break with the Society’s indefensible exclusion of women as members. So early in 1971, I put the question to as many undergraduates as I could corral, and the outcome was a unanimous vote of approval.  I made the same pitch to admit women at The Lampoon, where I was also president, and the response was also the same. We would revise our rules for membership and join the modern world.
A couple of days after the Signet vote, Professor Walter Kaiser, who chaired one of the Signet’s boards, urgently summoned me to a meeting at his home, which I recall thinking was the most elegant I had ever been inside. Graciously, but with unmistakable iron, he informed me that Professor Mason Hammond, who chaired another of the Signet’s boards, was apoplectic about what we had done. (I can’t remember whether that word was his, or my interpretation of his.)  The cause of outrage was procedural; our rash undergraduate action had ridden roughshod over the Signet’s by-laws, jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of the Society and threatening its very existence.
I don’t recall even hinting during that tense encounter with Professor Kaiser—which actually initiated a friendship—that Professor Hammond and other livid associates might be using a parliamentary argument as cover for their objection to admitting women, and I had no reason to think that was true, except for pretty much everything else I had observed about Harvard’s old guard since I had arrived at the College. So instead of litigating the merits of a co-ed Signet, and wondering how much trouble (like torpedoing my pending applications for various scholarships) I had gotten myself into, I determined to hold fast to our goal but to expunge every procedural irregularity from our little revolt.
It worked. A number of meetings and do-overs later, Tina Rathborne became the first woman elected as an undergraduate member of the Signet.
While all this was roiling, the Signet held a centennial gala. Attendance was so robust that the dinner took place in a banquet hall hung with Rothkos at the top of Holyoke Center. Erich W. Segal ’58 was the toastmaster, and Kurt Vonnegut was the speaker.  Also speaking were John H. Updike ’54, the recipient of the Signet Award, and the poet of the evening, Allen Ginsberg.  As president, and also as one of the evening’s speakers, I was seated between them. I remember asking Updike during the dinner—successfully, it turned out—if he would write the Foreword to a Lampoon centennial anthology I was editing. I also remember Ginsberg’s non-stop Om-ing; it was like the revving of a Buddhist Harley. But mainly I remember wondering how my own remarks would go over, since (as I discovered, listening to the other speakers, all of whom preceded me) what I had to say was much less lighthearted, much more earnest and—as far as Harvard’s politics and policies were concerned—not entirely loving.
I got the only standing ovation of the evening, and what I said turned out to be what I also said at Commencement, where I gave the English Oration in Tercentenary Theater. Over my gown, like many of my classmates, I wore a white armband bearing a red equal sign, signifying our call for the College to admit equal numbers of men and women freshmen, instead of the 4-to-1 ratio that was then the rule. A few feet from where I stood, sitting in the 400-year-old ceremonial chair of his office, was outgoing president Nathan M. Pusey ’28. A few years later, he was quoted in Harvard Magazine saying that my class—1971—was Harvard’s worst class ever, which is why ever since, the unofficial regalia worn as a badge of honor at our reunions by many of my classmates bears the acronym WCE.
After dessert at that Signet dinner, a bunch of us, including Updike and Ginsberg, walked from Holyoke Center down Plympton Street to the Lampoon Castle. Only men were present; Patty Marx, the first woman on the Lampoon, would be elected the next fall.  Upstairs in the Great Hall, Ginsberg took out a blue felt-tip and filled a page of a Lampoon Common Book. “Signet-Lampoon,” he put next to his signature. I included what he wrote and drew that night in the Lampoon anthology. For me it’s a memento of three venerable institutions—the Signet, the Lampoon, and Harvard itself—on the brink of what seems in retrospect to have been an almost inconceivably postponed evolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 1930s, the Australian government imported a hundred cane toads from Hawaii. Cane toads are very large. The biggest one on record tipped the scales at an impressive 5.84 pounds. Bufo marinus is also not very attractive. Its skin is dry, warty and unappealing. But the Australians weren’t interested in the toads for their looks or size. They wanted them to prey on cane beetles that were destroying the local sugar cane crop. In principle, the idea makes sense: If you have an unwanted pest, bring in a predator to decimate its population. In practice, biological pest control isn’t that simple. The cane toad experiment is a particularly well-known example, given its spectacular failure. As it turned out the toads couldn’t jump very high and the beetles were safe in their natural habitat atop the tall stalks of the sugar cane plants. The invaders preferred to prey on frogs, skinks and smaller insects anyway. And since their skin is coated in a strong toxin the toads killed any larger animals that tried to eat them, including many rare reptiles. The cane toads’ population increased exponentially. Scientists believe they currently number over 200 million. The toads have since become a bigger problem than the beetles ever were.
We love to believe we can quantify, measure and predict the phenomena of the natural world. But ecosystems are too fragile and the interactions between species too complex for this sort of outside meddling. More often than not, we simply mess things up even more. There are some success stories: Smaller predators work well. Tiny Braconid wasps, for example, do an excellent job of wiping out harmful flies and caterpillars. Mongoose, on the other hand, not only failed to eradicate rats when they were introduced into Hawaii in 1872 but also hunted rare bird populations to near extinction.
Human beings are perhaps the most dangerous pest control predator of all. In the 1980s, the United States and our allies Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan trained an army of mujahideen, holy warriors, to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Washington’s defense policy intellectuals wanted to give the Russians their very own “Vietnam,” a brutal war of attrition with no chance of victory. The mujahideen, mainly young men from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were as foreign to Afghanistan as Bufo marinus to Australia. But they were far more effective. The bloodied Russians withdrew in 1989 after accomplishing little and losing a great deal of money, manpower and prestige. The pest had been controlled. Now what would happen to the predator? No one in the West had bothered to plan for a post-Soviet Afghanistan. The mujahideen, trained by the CIA and armed with the latest weaponry, were left to fend for themselves. Some stayed to help the Taliban conquer Afghanistan. Many returned home, anxious to continue the jihad against Israel and their own repressive, American-sponsored military governments. A few joined a little-known group called Al Qaeda. Most Americans wouldn’t hear of these men again until the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in 1998 and the September 11th attacks of 2001. Our government was less than eager for its role in all this to become public knowledge, and even less eager for the public to learn that many of Al Qaeda’s leaders met and were radicalized in the torture chambers of our Egyptian and Saudi Arabian allies.
What do you do when a pest control predator gets out of control? In a classic episode of The Simpsons, Bart introduces bird-eating lizards into Springfield as a prank. With no natural predators and an abundant supply of pigeons, the lizard population soon spirals out of control. Mayor “Diamond Joe” Quimby imports a batch of lizard-eating snakes as a solution. But the snakes soon multiply and begin to invade the homes of local residents. Not to worry, the town’s scientists say, they are preparing to arrange a shipment of snake-eating gorillas. And so it continues, ad absurdum.
Faced with the challenge of radical Islamic terrorists, America’s political scientists believed they had little other choice but to follow a similar path. And so after September 11th our nation increased its support of military regimes and monarchies across the Muslim world, forgetting that the very existence of these repressive governments had radicalized many Muslims in the first place. First, we “sic-ed” the mujahideen on the Russians, then the military governments on the mujahideen. Now, America has belatedly realized that Mubaraks and Ben Ali’s are just as dangerous as Osama ever was to our long-term interests, and actively encouraged revolts against them. So far, the protests seem to be made up of disaffected young people, angry at the lack of jobs and political freedoms in their countries.
These revolutions are not “invasive” in the same way as Bufo marinus or the mujahideen. But how friendly will the new governments of the region be to America? Whether they become co-opted by anti-democratic radicals remains to be seen. A recent New York Times article reported that a few of the commanders of the Libyan revolution spent time in our prison at Guantanamo Bay, and so it seems we are turning our old enemies against our newest ones. Biologists have demonstrated that the best way to eradicate a pest is not to create a new one. Will politicians ever learn the same lesson? If we are in fact creating a new predator to eliminate the Arab autocracies, let’s hope we have some sort of plan for what comes after. But if history is any indication, we won’t. We’ll just look for a bigger, badder, meaner monster when the old one gets out of control.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whimsical adaptations of Harvard’s motto, “Veritas,” have been a staple of my four years here. The Dems replaced it with Stephen Colbert’s trademark “TRU-THI-NESS” on a freshman-year t-shirt. In Annenberg and Pfoho dining halls, I munched on “veritaffles.” And the April freshman revisit weekend was recently renamed “Visitas.” As undergraduates, we primarily encounter the school motto in this way, as an opportunity to play on words. Yet as graduation hurdles towards me, I’ve been thinking a great deal recently about how Veritas applies meaningfully to us students. What does Harvard, the great university with the one-word motto, have to say to us, on this day when so many things are being said?
When it comes to our work as scholars, the answer is easy. At the end of the nineteenth century, Harvard and other American universities refashioned themselves along the German research university model, strictly delineating disciplines and inventing rigorous training to produce professional academics, experts in their respective methodologies. By equipping scholars in this manner, the University believed it could best prepare them to push the boundaries of knowledge. Researchers would pursue the narrow lanes of inquiry open to their disciplines and thereby access Truth. Although the gospel of interdisciplinary study has spread since then, this model is still the basis for Harvard and the rest of the world of academia, where success is measured—for professor and undergraduate thesis-writer alike—by the yardstick of contributions to knowledge, however narrowly confined to a small sub-field.
As a thesis-writer this year, I’ve experienced the best of what this system has to offer. You never really know the extent to which Harvard is designed for original research until you try it. Aided by friendly archivists and remarkable archives, the advice and expertise of numerous professors, ample funding for research travel, and an inexhaustible set of library resources, I was able to pursue a topic that fascinated me and make my own small contribution to the world of knowledge. This work, in academic terms, is the pursuit of Veritas.
Yet I asked what Harvard has to say to us. And for all the pomp and circumstance this week surrounding scholastic achievement, we Harvard College students are mostly not headed for the halls of academia. Nor do we spend all our time here engaged in academic research. So what could the message of Veritas mean, if we hope that Harvard has something to say about our lives and futures beyond academic work, and the Christian connotation of the original phrase “Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae” does not speak to everyone?
Well, I think there’s another way of conceiving of truth that’s nearly the opposite of pursuing a single strand of academic inquiry. It’s the activity of trying to hold onto many strands all at once and make sense of the overall tapestry. It’s about attempting to reconcile apparently contradictory imperatives as part of a whole, rather than simply foregrounding one and choosing to ignore others. More than anything else, this process of truth-seeking—a process that requires a broad view rather than tunnel vision—is the tricky task of being human.
For example, as I go off into the world, I know that I value the life of the mind. It gives me joy, it satisfies some yearning within me, it provides an elevated place to meet the minds of others. Yet I also know that I already owe the world debts greater than I can ever repay, and that I can’t be content with simply plowing everything that Harvard and the rest of life has given me back into my own self-development. The unequal and arbitrary distribution of gifts and opportunities is too shameful for me to think of myself as anything but a temporary steward of it all. To respond to the freshman-year anxiety as to whether each of us “deserved” to get into Harvard: I won’t know until I do something with it to serve others.
Even within the realm of service, however, there’s a tension between two different truths: Institutional mechanisms, like those of politics, can allow for systematic change with broad effects, yet working directly with people can provide more daily satisfaction, empower others, and ground one’s efforts in reality. So what kind of life should we lead? As I consider my own future, I wonder if I should spend my time shuttling between intellectual inquiry, political activity, and direct service, or try to settle on an intermediate location somewhere on the plane defined by those three points. Perhaps four points, actually, since there is also of course the daily work of being kind to the people in our lives, of forming human relationships and community.
Harvard could do a better job of preparing us to wrestle with the challenges of this sort of truth-seeking. Rather than focus so much on keeping score of accomplishments in ultra-specific realms, it could try to build an undergraduate environment that actively supports and acknowledges the struggle of crafting a balanced, fulfilling life. It could also lead by example, by making more effort to wrestle with its own existential tensions as an institution. How are we to justify such a concentration of wealth and power in one institution, for example, if that wealth and power is merely self-perpetuating? Is it enough for incidental benefits to accrue to the world, as by-products of Harvard’s successes, or do we need an intentional institutional mission of service? Does the University have anything to say to its graduates, beyond advocacy for the pursuit of truth in academics? These are the questions that will echo in my mind at this week’s Commencement. For it turns out that “Veritas” is far richer food for thought than veritaffles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, former dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, leans forward, pounds the table, and raises his voice as he presents his core philosophy, the one that prompted him to fight for the creation of SEAS and that still gets him excited three years later.
“We will not be a great university without a great engineering school,” he declares. “Until we build a strong engineering school, Harvard as an institution will always get a grade of incomplete.”
In the four years since SEAS became its own school within the University, Harvard has come a long way towards addressing that “incomplete” on its report card. The School has invested in faculty expansion, student advising, and innovative design elements across introductory and advanced level courses. And with consistent growth trends that show no signs of slowing, Harvard’s engineering program is poised to become one of the best in the country.
But as the School comes into its own, administrators, professors, and students alike agree on a guiding principle to integrate engineering with Harvard’s liberal arts environment.
“SEAS often talks about educating renaissance engineers, engineers with a strong liberal arts understanding of what engineering is,” says University President Drew G. Faust. Engineering, she says, is “not simply execution of an instrumental project but rather intersects with ideas and thought processes that are very much at the heart of the liberal arts.”
NEW CURRICULUM, NEW STAFF
Much of the recent development within SEAS has focused on the undergraduate experience and expanding the options available to students.
The biomedical engineering concentration introduced last year marked SEAS’ first attempt to differentiate the umbrella engineering sciences degree program. Efforts to further diversify undergraduate offerings are underway, with pending approval for a new electrical engineering concentration for the fall of 2012. A mechanical engineering concentration is also being proposed.
“We are revamping the curriculum [and] taking a very hard look at the engineering and applied sciences curriculum across the entire School,” says SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray, adding that she plans to place “focus on a coherent curriculum for the 21st century.”
According to Marie D. Dahleh, SEAS assistant dean for academic programs, efforts to diversify graduate degree programs are also in progress. A new secondary field in computational science and engineering has been proposed—a development that Dahleh believes will strengthen SEAS overall.
After receiving feedback from senior concentrators, SEAS administrators have also taken steps to enhance the undergraduate advising structure. The responses gave engineering sciences one of the lowest rankings in concentrator satisfaction at the College. SEAS has since moved to hire more preceptors, directors of undergraduate studies, and assistant directors of undergraduate studies.
“I want the student experience to be number one,” Murray says.
THE LIBERAL ENGINEER
Murray is realistic about Harvard’s potential to get the sought-after number one ranking in the near future. “For Harvard—the near future being the next 100 years—yes. Definitely not in the next ten years,” she says.
Professors and administrators both agree that Harvard is still too small to compare with more iconic engineering institutions.
“We will graduate 45 Ph.D.’s. For us that’s a pretty healthy number,” says Dahleh. “But you know places like Purdue will be graduating a lot more.”
But many people see potential in Harvard’s small size. “It’s interesting in that it’s a much smaller program, much newer, much faster growing, more nimble,” says Matthew W. Yarri ’14, who is considering the engineering concentration.
Harvard’s Wyss Institute has made bold strides as a flexible, inter-disciplinary center in helping to define the field of biological engineering, according to George M. Church, a professor of genetics and member of the affiliated faculty of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST).
“There’s nothing really like it in the world,” he says.
Interdisciplinary work in research laboratories also parallels a growing emphasis on design-based curricula in undergraduate teaching laboratories.
“Historically [the curriculum] was very theoretical but now there’s a big shift to do the applied side of engineering,” says Daniel H. Nevius ’11, president of the Harvard College Engineering Society. He adds that a student “push for hands-on engineering” has met with enthusiasm from the faculty.
“We want students to be excited about what we have here,” says Anas Chalah, director of instructional laboratories at SEAS. “When [students] come to Harvard ... we want them to be pleasantly shocked. Our teaching labs are one little link in that big chain that will bring us to being number one in engineering.”
Chalah says that non-concentrators are also likely to benefit from the lab components in general education courses like ES1: “Introduction to Engineering Sciences” and ES50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering.”
“Students from such divisions who didn’t care about engineering [now] become interested,” says Chalah, adding that this aspect of outreach makes the facilities part of SEAS’ educational mission to reach out to students from all disciplines.
“One of my goals is to have every student take an engineering course, something like [Computer Science 50] for example,” explains Murray. “It gets people aware of what engineering actually is. We have so much technology in our society it just gets an awareness that you too can write iPhone apps.”
FINDING SYNERGY
Murray hopes to reach around 600 SEAS concentrators—ten to fifteen percent of the undergraduate population—within the next ten years. If finances allow, she would also like to hire 30 new faculty members in the same time frame.
But Harvard is still far from comparing itself to its neighbor down Mass. Ave.
In the 2009-2010 school year, SEAS—which includes applied math, computer sciences, and engineering—had 415 undergraduate concentrators. By contrast, MIT had 1,977 engineering majors—which includes engineering and computer science—this school year.
With these numbers, MIT is able to offer resources that Harvard cannot provide.
It is, for example, a leader in sustaining a resource that SEAS has recently made a priority: lab space.
“MIT lab space is fantastic,” says Rashid M. Yasin ’12, an engineering concentrator. “I took a course there last spring that had its own lab space ... almost wholly devoted to that one class.”
Nevius, the undergraduate president of the HCES, says that lab space at Harvard is often cramped. Pierce G12, a laboratory in the basement of Pierce Hall, was at one point housing nine senior thesis projects, one NASA competition project, and one hydrokinetic turbine project, he explains. “You could barely walk down in that space.”
Church, the affiliate of HST, also says that MIT can capitalize on its established position in the field of engineering to draw funding from spin-off companies and industry leaders alike.
But some faculty members at Harvard say that the University’s cross-disciplinary resources are an asset for SEAS.
Harvard Medical School Associate Professor Ali Khademhosseini, who is also affiliated with HST, says that SEAS can develop a “synergistic” relationship with other components of the University.
“Potentially engineering at Harvard already is bigger and more competitive than it appears,” he says. “It simply could be how we could present it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the Friday morning in April when his appointment as Provost was announced, Alan M. Garber ’76 spoke in subdued tones as he discussed his thoughts on succeeding Steven E. Hyman. But Garber lit up with excitement—the corners of his mouth tugging up into a small smile—as he touched on the possibilities associated with Harvard’s expansion in Allston.
With a medical degree and a Ph.D. in economics, Garber—a Stanford professor who will assume the Provost position at the end of this academic year—says he is particularly excited to spearhead Harvard’s development in Allston, a place where Harvard’s wide breadth of science resources could centralize and flourish through interdisciplinary work.
“One of the biggest attractions of this job is the ability to participate in the future of the Allston campus,” Garber said at the time. “I view Allston as an opportunity unlike any other in American higher education today, where there is a campus that can be used to help realize the University’s vision for the future and make this a truly 21st century university.”
Despite his optimism, Garber will take up his post facing a historically difficult relationship between the University and the neighborhood and a future in which Harvard, having learned from the financial crisis, must proceed cautiously. While Garber has previously said that spearheading the University’s Allston planning is one of the most exciting aspects of the provost position, he was unable to elaborate on his vision for Allston.
Despite spending the past 25 years at Stanford, Garber will be at home at Harvard. He is a summa cum laude graduate who studied Economics at the College. He went on to receive his Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard and an M.D. from Stanford. During his time on the Stanford faculty, Garber’s academic work has focused mainly on health policy economics, but he has also served on a Harvard Medical School and Harvard Dental School visiting committee.
Garber’s colleagues, both those past at Stanford and future at Harvard, say they believe his accomplishments on the west coast will give him the momentum to bring the sciences to Allston, though it will be a challenging project.
A DIFFICULT PAST
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Harvard purchased 52.6 acres of land in Allston under a subsidiary of a different name, with plans to expand the University’s campus across the river.
In 1997, Allston residents discovered Harvard’s stealthy purchases of land, sparking tensions between the neighborhood and the University. But in 2003, the University revealed its plans for a portion of its land-holdings; Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard’s president at the time, announced that the University would build the Allston Science Complex on a large plot of land on Western Avenue, behind the Harvard Business School. Four years of community meetings and strategic planning followed.
In 2007, the Boston Redevelopment Authority fast-tracked the plan for approval, and the following year the University broke ground on the site.
But Harvard was only able to construct the foundation of the complex. Following, the financial crisis in the Fall of 2008, Harvard announced it was slowing construction on the site in Feb. 2009 and halted it completely that December. The plot of land on Western Avenue that was meant to be a vibrant center for stem cell research is now a paved-over foundation—a building project indefinitely on hold—surrounded by a fence and University-subsidized shrubbery. In the wake of the halt on construction, Harvard University President Drew G. Faust promised a three-part plan that would develop Allston in other ways: leasing and improving vacant property, engaging the community, and developing Harvard’s campus when feasible.
Harvard asserts that it has made good on the first two portions of this plan, having leased over 118,000 square feet of land to 12 businesses and nonprofit organizations in the past six months.
The leases include an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, a boxing club, a swiss bakery, and most recently a dance studio, Mass Motion. Many residents say they are excited that vacant lands will soon spur activity, but other community members note that they feel the businesses will not provide them with everyday necessities that have been lost since Harvard began buying up property in the neighborhood.
“We had a community master-plan and this is what we’re getting—we’re getting restaurants,” says Paul Berkeley, the president of the Allston Civic Association, recalling the loss of retail outlets, such as Kmart and OfficeMax.
Others say that while bringing businesses to Allston is beneficial to the local economy, it does not compare to the number of jobs that the construction and presence of the Science Complex would have provided the neighborhood. Furthermore, Harvard’s original proposals for Allston reveal a plan to make the neighborhood a cultural center, with the possibility of transporting some of the University’s museums across the river.
“[Western Avenue} was going to be completely remade with culture and museums, and what we’re getting is some pizza and a bakery some day,” says Harry E. Mattison, a member of the Harvard Allston Task Force.
THE ROAD AHEAD
While Allston may not be a cultural center for the University in the immediate future, there is renewed discussion about bringing Harvard’s sciences across the river. As the economy stabilizes and Harvard’s endowment regains its strength, the University once again sets its sights on Allston. Hyman says that he is “quite hopeful” that there will be “active Harvard academic programs” in Allston in the next ten to fifteen years, suggesting that the construction project will see resurrection, though perhaps not in its original form. As the new provost, Garber’s job will be to bring vision and vigor to Harvard’s plans for development in Allston, taking the lead from Hyman, a man who has seen years of dreams deferred in the neighborhood.
“I oversaw the development of the academic plan for the Allston Science Complex, and my greatest disappointment as provost is that a plan I believed in, because of changes to the economy, had to go on ice,” says Hyman who was provost under Summers when the project was first announced and has overseen academic planning at the University for the past decade. “At times, I just felt defeated by the financial reality. It certainly caused me to reflect on the possibility that the physical plan was grander than perhaps we needed for the academic plan,” Hyman adds, who—like Garber—is a physician and researcher by training.
Hyman’s tenure represents the longest in the history of the position, which was created 19 years ago. He has endured the tumultuous end of Summers’ presidency, the transition to Faust, and the devastating effects of the financial crisis. In order to succeed in Allston, Hyman notes that Garber must make the project his own.
“In the end Alan is going to have to own the academic plan because if Allston is going to be a success it’s going to have to bring together, just within the science part, FAS, Harvard Medical School, the School of Public Health and, ideally, the Business School,” Hyman says.
Garber is cognizant of the role the provost must play in bringing together different disciplines from across the University as the administration considers its path forward in Allston.
“In the case of Allston, the challenge is not only to figure out which disciplines would benefit from the facilities located in Allston, but also to predict where synergies might occur,” Garber writes in an email. “In other words, we need to understand how the pieces will fit together, assessing the potential for unexpected and productive collaborations.”
Garber will not be without help in developing a viable academic vision for the University in Allston. For the past year and a half, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp has overseen the Allston Work Team, a 14-person group of deans, alumni, and faculty commissioned by Faust to asses Harvard’s presence in the neighborhood and develop recommendations for how to proceed. The results of their findings will be available to the community in June, according to the group’s co-chair Bill Purcell, though neither he nor Lapp would comment on the shape the recommendations will take or the nature of their content.
“[Garber] will certainly be very much in the mix in terms of understanding what kind of activities and interdisciplinary opportunities exist,” says Lapp, noting that she, personally, has briefed him on the main issues around the University’s development in Allston. “We make sure he has as much information as possible,” she adds.
Lapp, whose past titles include executive director of the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City and executive vice president for business operations at the University of California, comes to the puzzle of Harvard’s expansion in Allston from a business and urban development perspective and has used that knowledge to collaborate with Work Team’s chairs, who have differing areas of expertise.
Purcell, a former mayor of Nashville, was the director of the Institute of Politics until April 2010, when he stepped down to devote more time to developing the Work Team’s recommendations. Purcell has a long history of witnessing the tensions that arise from University expansion.
Growing up in Philadelphia, Purcell has noted that he experienced first hand the University of Pennsylvania’s contentious development into its surrounding neighborhoods, a past he says he brings to bear in his current work. Purcell holds monthly coffee hours intended to allow Allston residents to express concerns; the last will take place this June, when the Work Team’s recommendations are released.
Working alongside Purcell are Business School Professor Peter Tufano ’79 and Graduate School of Design Professor Alex Krieger, who were chosen to bring different perspectives to the process.
Christine M. Heenan, vice president for public affairs and communication, notes that Garber’s foundation in science will be useful in evaluating and implementing the Work Team’s recommendations.
Heenan says that Garber will be an asset in figuring out “how to take the programmatic opportunities that exist, how to envision the future of science, life-science, and...what happens inside the physical structures.”
“There is an increasing coalescence around the future in Allston,” Heenan adds. “He’ll, of course, want to spend time there.”
UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?
Many of Garber’s former and future colleagues note that he is a man who has a history of listening, of integrating perspectives and seeing the big picture, qualities that will serve him well in taking up the challenges presented by Harvard’s future in Allston.
As a young graduate student David M. Cutler ’87, a Harvard professor of applied economics and global health, knew he could not pass up the opportunity to speak with the well-known economist at a conference both were attending.
“I was a first or second year graduate, and he took a fair amount of time to speak with me,” says Cutler, a former dean of the social sciences, remembering the surprise he felt when Garber agreed unhesitatingly.
Cutler says that the respect he gained for the man who exchanged thoughts with him has not faltered. From paving new paths in health care policy to running the Boston marathon, Garber has made a favorable impression on colleagues at both Stanford and Harvard.
“Alan is very respected here,” Cutler says. “Every time there’s has been a search for a health care policy position that I’ve been a part of his name came up.”
For these reasons, Garber found himself in a similar situation 20 years later. Instead of a student seeking advice, it was Faust seeking a provost. She invited him to lunch one January afternoon when she was visiting California. Just a few months later, she announced his appointment to the post.
Fresh off the California coast, Garber has experience integrating different disciplines within a university, according to his colleagues. Before Garber accepted the position at Harvard, he was in the midst of organizing a Stanford-wide program on health care affordability—according to Paul G. Yock, professor of medicine at Stanford and Garber’s friend for the past 30 years.
“He is able to see issues broadly, mobilize a broad stakeholder community, and then execute effectively,” Yock says of the project, which has not yet been completed. He adds that these skills, along with Garber’s deep engagement with his current community, will be major assets for his role in Allston.
“He’s a real citizen in every respect,” Yock says.
Yock adds that Garber’s hybrid background in science, health care, and economics will provide him with the wisdom necessary to drive home Harvard’s plans for Allston.
“I think in selecting Alan Garber to serve as provost, Harvard has improved its capacity to deal with a very challenging set of issues,” says Coit D. Blacker, a professor of international studies at Stanford, when asked about Garber’s role in Allston planning.
“I think he can drive the process very, very effectively, at the same time I think he can help Drew Faust provide very high quality leadership as we all head into the second decade of the twenty-first century,” Blacker says. “He thinks institutionally and that’s why he’s great for Harvard,” he adds.
Though the specifics of how Garber will shape Harvard’s expansion in Allston remain unclear, Harvard administrators say that they believe he is up for the challenge.
“I have every confidence that Alan will step in and continue the progress that has been made on moving forward,” Hyman says, adding that he believes Garber will “relish” the opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Week is a time when undergraduates begin to understand how Harvard functions as a college and a social space. Eager to make friends and meet others, freshmen scurry from ice cream socials to faculty panels to organizations’ introductory meetings. Sex Signals—a mandatory seminar on sexual harassment and consensual sex—is one such staple activity.
But some say that Sex Signals does not simply represent freshmen’s introduction to consent. Rather, the seminar is the first in a line of many Harvard traditions, both formal and informal, that highlight the College’s unconscious bias towards heterosexual students, known as heterosexism in the field of gender theory.
Sex Signals, a show of improvisational comedy presented by a man and a woman, deals primarily with ‘signals’ sent between a heterosexual couple.
The College does offer a same sex variety of Sex Signals. But, as the seminar is required, students must go through the extra hurdle of explaining to their proctor why they will not be attending ‘regular’ Sex Signals—a situation that some say could be particularly awkward if a student has not yet come to terms with his or her sexuality.
Only twenty or so students—out of a class of over 1,600—attended same sex Sex Signals last year, according to Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12. As a freshman, Wang says she was not even aware of the same sex seminar.
Furthermore, while ‘Straight Sex Signals’ is held in a massive auditorium in the Science Center, ‘Gay Sex Signals’ is tucked away in a small room in the Holyoke Center—leading some students to say that though Harvard has made significant strides in the recent past, the University still has not fully integrated its straight and gay communities.
“Sex signals should be integrated, because in reality sexuality is very fluid, and anyone could be dealing with a same sex harassment issue or opposite sex at any time regardless of  their sexual orientation,” Nicole K. Poteat ’11 says.
But the issues that some members of the gay community say the Sex Signals performance bring to the fore do not end Freshmen Week, with some queer students noting that Harvard’s unconscious bias against many members of its community is salient in their daily lives.
“[Heterosexism is] just a less aggressive form of intolerance,” says Carolyn W. Chou ’13, who is not active in the QSA but is involved in social justice initiatives on campus.
Some queer undergraduates say that they would like to see a Harvard where the student body and the administration consciously work toward full cohesion between the straight and gay communities.
“There’s a difference between tolerance, which is passive, and acceptance, which is active,” Chou says.
A CULTURAL DIVIDE
Some point to the paucity of straight allies participating in the QSA to indicate the College’s lack of true integration. In the past few years the group’s board members have included only a handful of straight allies, according to Wang.
“Heterosexism is subtle enough. If it doesn’t feel like an assault on your own identity, it’s hard to recognize it on a day to day basis,” Chou says, proposing an explanation for the lack of vocal allies on campus.
The QSA’s social functions are poorly attended by straight supporters, according to Wang. She says that she hopes to bolster the number of active allies in the QSA by holding several events specifically targeting allies.
But Brandon T. Perkovich ’11, a gay student who was active in the First-Year Urban Program and H-Bomb Magazine, says that there are many supportive allies on campus and that it is unreasonable to expect them to “wear a rainbow flag all the time.”
However, he adds that does not mean allies should stand by and remain quiet when they hear homophobic comments made by others.
“They need to have the courage—allies are uniquely positioned to affect a change by calling people out,” Perkovich says, noting that this does not happen as often as it should.
Some queer students note that integration between the gay and straight communities at Harvard will only come about through significant changes in social life at the College.
Poteat, an openly gay Eliot House resident, says that during her four years at Harvard, she often felt uncomfortable or not fully “accepted” in certain contexts because of her sexual identity. Often social traditions, particularly date functions organized between single-sex organizations, can feel particularly exclusive, she says.
“In other groups [besides varsity rugby] I’ve participated in, the social life consists of going to final clubs and getting guys,” Poteat says. “A sort of spoken intolerance exists by way of not including people who aren’t interested in that. The dominant social scene is not inclusive of anyone who is not heterosexual.”
Wang echoes these sentiments, saying that she believes that some students chose to stay in the closet at Harvard because they feel they will not be actively embraced in their social circles.
“It’s a two-way dance,” Wang says. “We live in a heteronormative society, and for some individuals it’s better to cover and not to risk coming out in an environment that might not accept queerness.”
Though Wang says that she has not experienced conscious outright discrimination herself, Perkovich says that he has been called “faggot” at Harvard more frequently than anywhere else.
“I have been called ‘faggot’ in a really disparaging way here at Harvard,” Perkovich says. “Even more so than in my very conservative hometown in Florida.”
But unconscious bias against queer students is not confined to social settings, some members of the gay community say, noting that it can seep into the classroom. Many say that few classes besides those offered by the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality department deal with issues of gender and sexuality.
Chou recalls that a teaching fellow once made an insensitive joke in a section comprised solely of women that suggested all the women were interested in men.
A course on inequality included little discussion of sexuality­—or at least not until Wang approached her professor asking if she could write a paper dealing with issues of sexuality, she says.
“We talked about race and gender, but not once did we talk about sexuality,” Wang says. “LGBT issues really aren’t discussed outside of WGS.”
Poteat remembers a similar experience in a class she took that focused on the television show The Wire. The instructor discussed issues of race and class as they are highlighted in the show, but Poteat says she felt that while sexuality was touched on, it did not get the attention it deserved.
She says she did not feel comfortable raising the topic because she did not “want to be that token lesbian raising the issue.” “I just kept my mouth shut,” she says.
“There’s this idea here, and in the U.S. and the rest of the world, that gay things only matter to gay people,” Wang adds. “Heterosexism can range from crushing ignorance to sometimes well-intentioned ignorance.”
WORKING TOWARDS ACCEPTANCE
Queer students say that the lack of full integration at Harvard is not unique to the University.
“Again [heterosexism is] something that’s a national trend, but Harvard doesn’t do enough to counter it,” Poteat adds.
But College administrators say that their data indicates otherwise. After having concluded a year-long analysis of attitudes in the Harvard community toward queer issues, the GLBTQ Task Force concluded that the College has created a largely friendly environment for its queer population.
“What we learned is that this a very welcoming and inclusive place, but there was a recommendation that we made some improvements in these areas,” Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson says.
To address students’ concern that sexuality is often ignored in the classroom, Nelson says the administration will encourage more classes to include material on the issue.
The Task Force’s report, released last month, recommended that the College establish a more visible LGBTQ resource center with a full-time staffer. The administration immediately acted upon this and the Queer Resource Center—currently located in a closet-like space in the basement of Thayer Hall and run by students—will be located in Boylston Hall and staffed by a full-time administrator next year.
Though the center could possibly further sequester some of the College’s gay population away from the rest of the student body, Poteat says that this center is necessary for queer students on campus.
“To say that greater queer visibility is going to polarize the queer community is to take for granted the heterosexism on campus,” Perkovich says.
Despite the challenges that queer students say they face on campus, they note that they are not without hope for the future.
“I think that allies are finding it hard to have a voice in LGBT issues,” says Wang. “Many are still trying to find a voice. Without institutional support there is a sense that vocalization is exceptional and unique, but I was heartened by the incoming class.”
She adds that the QSA introductory meeting “had an astounding attendance at prefrosh weekend from people who were there just supporting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The words “fight, fight, fight” chanted during the 1969 protest against Harvard’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps may share a superficial similarity to “fight the cuts,” a rallying cry during the March for Common Sense this April. But the two protests couldn’t have been more different.
The 1969 rally ended with police clubbing and teargassing the protesters over 300 of whom were arrested, but the other ended with all protesters peacefully returning home after presenting their demands to Mass. Senator John Kerry.
While the concussions and bruises that resulted four decades ago may have been especially brutal even for a period marked by intense student activism, in its own way last month’s rally was an aberration. For a generation raised on a steady diet of Facebook and Twitter, activists are less eager to leave behind their laptops and pick up picket signs, many students say.
This generation of Harvard protesters often puts dialogue before destruction, classes before causes, and private conversation before public confrontation.
The commitment hasn’t abated, students say, but the strategy has changed.
“Today’s Harvard student is a rule follower. They’re at Harvard because they followed the rules. They do well at Harvard because they follow the rules and the rules are to follow the system,” says Michael W. McLean ’12, president of the Harvard Republican Club.
SCHOOLING THE ACTIVIST
In order to start one’s career as a modern activist, a Harvard undergraduate must look no further than the course catalog.
Students this year have spurred the creation of a new secondary field in Innovation for Social Change, an interdisciplinary program that has been sponsored by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
While many of the details are still being worked out, the secondary field will give students the opportunity to explore a range of real world tactics to create social change.
“You get to Harvard and you’re sitting in Tercentenary Theater and President [Drew G.] Faust is telling you how you’re going to change the world, but there’s no real institutional support to motivate further thinking and a deeper analysis,” says Bonnie Cao ’12, vice president of the Undergraduate Council.
A CHANGE IN TACTICS
Even outside the classroom, Harvard activists tend to take incremental steps to further their causes, before adopting more disruptive strategies.
When students first found out about the $650,000 fund to honor former Social Studies Head Tutor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz—who had previously made controversial comments about the Muslim community—they gathered in dorm rooms, not to organize a protest, but rather to draft a letter to the Social Studies department to explain their concerns.
It was only after the department failed to reverse its decision about the fund that students expanded the scope of their efforts with protests in front of the Science Center, putting public pressure on the University, according to Abdelnasser Rashid ’11.
This chain of events follows an increasingly common pattern, which moves from deliberation, to discussion, to public criticism, and finally to protests.
“Harvard students tend to work through administrations that exist. For better or for worse that means more collaboration, signing petitions online, and petitioning office hours rather than the protesting outside University Hall that happened in the ’60s,” UC President Senan Ebrahim says.
To help students communicate their concerns, the UC has moved to become a liaison between the undergraduate population and the College on politically charged issues.
In what was a “defining moment” in the history of the UC, according to Ebrahim, the UC balanced its concerns about evolving into a political group with its desire to consider an issue that had an overwhelming amount of student support: It passed a piece of legislation condemning the University’s decision to honor Peretz.
“What we are is a student voice for the administration,” Cao says. “If we can do anything to emphasize student voices to the administration, we’re going to try to do that.”
PROTESTING ONLINE
In addition to a shift toward implementing change through more administrative channels, students are increasingly using the internet to spread their message, undergraduates say.
While this transition allows students to reach a wide audience, some activists say that the internet can distract from real-world activism, which they argue tends to be more effective.
“People start thinking, ‘Ok, I can just send an email or join a Facebook group and I’m being active,’ but I don’t think that’s effective activism,” Rashid says.
In planning a rally to support AmeriCorps before Representative Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, visited the Institute of Politics earlier this year, Samuel B. Novey ’11 did the majority of his organizing without using the number of email lists he was a part of.
Instead, he had as many individual conversations with people as possible and tried to convince them why his cause was personal, not abstract, he says.
“This wasn’t some idealistic issue that people kind of cared about,” says Jackson F. Cashion ’13, one of the other organizers of the rally in support of AmeriCorps. “It was a message people could rally and latch on to because it was about the seniors who were going to dedicate the next two years of their lives to something really great.”
But both Novey and Cashion say that the way to get people invested in their cause wasn’t flooding their email and Facebook inboxes.
They say that the way to get students to pick up signs and fight for something they believed in was to connect the issue in a concrete way to their lives.
LEGAL LIMITS
But modern organizers are more concerned about University and federal restrictions than they were decades ago.
This willingness to work only within the boundaries of accepted channels may have implications beyond a simple change in tactics, critics say.
The efforts to work within the system may prevent student activists from reaching their objectives, according to Professor Marshall L. Ganz ’64, a lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.
“There may be a wish that if we all just share the information and we all just talk together, it will work out and it’s just not so,” Ganz says. “There must be an appreciation for the importance of conflict, not violence, but contention, especially within a democratic system.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been three years since 19-year-old Matthew Sunshine celebrated the end of exams in a Northwestern dorm room by pounding down 17 shots of vodka in about an hour. The next day, his parents received the worst phone call imaginable: Their son had died of alcohol poisoning.
Besides devastating the campus community, the tragic incident also put the university in the crosshairs of potential litigation—in part because Sunshine was on university property, consuming alcohol when he was two years below the legal drinking age.
This fall, Northwestern agreed to review their own alcohol policy and pay Sunshine’s family $2 million.
While universities like Harvard consider the effect that their policies will have on student safety and undergraduate life, there is another factor that is often outside the public eye except when tragedy strikes. When it crafts and enforces policies, the University must consider its legal liability in order to protect its billions of dollars in assets and prevent damage to its reputation. In recent years, Harvard has moved to modify its policies on alcohol and sexual assault to better ensure that its rules and procedures adhere to the ever-shifting legal climate.
TITLE IX POLICIES
In April, Vice President Joe Biden and the Office for Civil Rights published a new set of guidelines explaining what universities must do to keep their sexual assault and sexual harassment procedures in line with federal law.
The new guidelines—which clarify, among other issues, the standard of evidence required to begin investigations in cases of sexual assault—have pushed universities like Harvard to reevaluate their own policies.
“My thinking is that their sense is that campuses were in need of guidance,” Director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Sarah Rankin said. “It was really to clarify the points that [the federal government] perceived schools were struggling to understand and meet.”
Harvard’s Office of General Counsel—which functions as a university-wide legal team—is currently examining each school’s policies and procedures to ensure that they are in line with federal law.
At Harvard, assaults and incidents of harassment by Harvard students that occurred off campus—for example, at final clubs or fraternities in the Square—are already considered to be within the College’s disciplinary purview, according to Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison. But the new guidelines mandate this practice.
“The new Title IX guidelines are much more aware of off-campus behaviors,” said Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law and policy. “I don’t think the schools have the same luxuries they had even two months ago.”
A Title IX investigation by the Office for Civil Rights that began this year against Yale University will likely attract scrutiny from its peer institutions and has the potential to further alter sexual assault and sexual harassment policies across the nation.
The complaint alleges that a number of public incidents and Yale University policies created a “hostile sexual environment.”
During one incident cited in the complaint, students chanted, “No means yes! Yes means anal!” on Yale’s Old Campus, according to the Yale Daily News. In another instance, student-athletes and fraternity members circulated a “Preseason Scouting Report” which ranked the sexual attractiveness of female undergraduates on Yale’s campus, providing the women’s names, hometowns, and residential colleges.
The complaint further asserts that Yale created an environment in which charges of sexual harassment and assault are not adequately investigated.
Harvard Law School is similarly being investigated this year by the Office for Civil Rights after New England School of Law Adjunct Professor Wendy J. Murphy filed a complaint against the school, arguing that its policies for dealing with sexual assault cases were inefficient and unclear, and furthermore relied on too high a standard of evidence to begin proceedings. The Law School deferred comment to OCR in April.
ENFORCING 21
Alcohol on college campuses poses a number of legal hurdles for university officials.
At universities nation-wide, underage drinking is a fact of life that administrators must confront as part of their attempts to keep university policies within legal bounds.
Lake explained that the drinking age—which was raised to 21 across the nation in 1986—has often been used as more of a “speed limit” than a standard of perfect compliance. On university campuses the attitude has been one of general denial, Lake said.
And—like the investigations at Yale and the Law School, which have the potential to reshape sexual assault policy—changing events in the past decade have provided an incentive for Harvard to look more closely at its own policies on underage drinking on campus.
In a 1997 case at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Scott S. Krueger, a freshman pledge at Phi Gamma Delta, shared a bottle of spiced rum with his big brother in the fraternity, drinking to the chorus of “Drink her down, drink her down, drink her down, down, down.”
By the end of the night, Krueger was in a coma with a blood alcohol content of 0.401, more than five times the legal limit to drive in Massachusetts. After 40 hours, he was pronounced dead.
In this case, the fraternity—rather than its members or MIT—was indicted on criminal charges of manslaughter.
The District Attorney in charge of the case, Ralph C. Martin II, said to reporters at the time that in determining the extent of Krueger’s personal responsibility, he took into consideration that the victim was both underage and a freshman in college.
Ultimately, prosecutors were unable to pursue the case after the fraternity disbanded.
In addition, MIT paid a $4.75 million settlement to Krueger’s family and created a $1.25 million scholarship in his name. The family’s lawyer said that they would have sued MIT if an agreement had not been reached.
After Krueger’s death, MIT altered its alcohol policies and its relationship with the Greek system in order to create a safer drinking environment.
“Our approach to alcohol education and policy ... were inadequate,” wrote MIT President Charles Vest in a letter to Krueger’s parents.
Over the past decade, the state of Massachusetts has become increasingly punitive in cases where individuals under 21 are found with alcohol, according to Jeffrey M. Sankey, a lawyer at the Boston-based law firm Dolan Connly, PC.
“Even three or four years ago, students would be caught underage drinking and they’d sort of just be shooed along,” Sankey said. “Now I think that any time that ... anyone under the age of 21 is noticed drinking alcohol, very often now they are referred to the courts.”
Harvard’s Administrative Board has never punished a student simply for drinking underage, said Ellison—who is the Secretary of the Ad Board. But the College, in an effort to align its policies with state law, has tried to avoid funding events where underage drinking is likely to occur. For example, in 2007, the College terminated the Undergraduate Council’s “Party Grants” program, which gave students money to host parties with alcohol.
“[T]he UC has not assumed responsibility ... for verifying that underage students will not be reimbursed for purchasing alcohol,” wrote then-Interim Dean of the College David Pilbeam in an open letter at the time.
At Harvard, these stipulations have had effects on how drinking is treated on campus. This March, the semiannual Pforzheimer Golf event was canceled after House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 reviewed the College’s alcohol policy and determined that the event did not fit with the statement’s intent.
“I think that the alcohol policy as a whole is designed to keep our student body as safe and healthy as we can, but also there are legal limitations on what we are allowed to do,” Pfoho House Committee Co-Chair Graham M. Frankel ’12 said in an interview at the time. “Harvard doesn’t shield us from the fact that we’re not allowed to serve alcohol to people under 21.”
Changes on a state and local level have also affected many event policies. Last spring, the Cambridge License Commission decided to stop issuing hard liquor licenses to events hosted by HoCos, such as stein clubs or formals. In the wake of this decision, the College announced last spring that only beer and wine would be served at on-campus events. This spring, the College decided to ban hard alcohol from on-campus formals as well.
“I’ve suspected that a number of the more elite institutions and the cities that house these institutions are ramping up enforcement issues,” Lake said. “There’s less willingness to tolerate ‘Animal House’ culture than there was 20 years ago.”
PLACING RESPONSIBILITY
Beyond the need to keep drinking practices on campus within the bounds of state law, universities must worry about their own legal complicity when drinking goes wrong, regardless of age or location of those consuming the alcohol.
“Alcohol is the biggest risk factor on a college campus,” Lake said.
It is events like those at Northwestern and MIT that College officials cite in their discussions about safe drinking habits. And while such cases provide stark reminders of the dangers to student health and well-being that alcohol may pose, the pecuniary and legal consequences of these incidents should not be underestimated.
Many of the changes in policies around House events stemmed from shifts in who might be allowed to sign the liquor licenses, and who, as a result, would be seen as the liable “host” under Massachusetts law. While it remains unclear who could be blamed if a student were hurt at a Stein Club or formal, HoCo leaders say that they feel responsible for events they throw.
“In Mather, we are instructed by our House Masters and our administrators and even prior HoCos that we are responsible for the safety of the House residents,” Mather HoCo Co-Chair Andrew F. Iannone ’12 said in an interview in March.
Beyond House-sponsored events, student groups—both officially recognized clubs and off-campus, unrecognized groups such as final clubs and fraternities—must work with the University to understand how to minimize risk.
As James F. Mosher—a California-based lawyer who specializes in alcohol policy—explained, universities like Harvard may avoid official relationships with such off-campus groups because they might be held liable despite not having adequate ability to survey and control the environment.
“I never wanted to have responsibility over something I had no oversight for,” former Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 said.
And occasionally things do go wrong—at both on and off campus events—though no recent Harvard tragedies compare to the deaths on other campuses. When there is an alcohol-related problem at an event hosted by a student group, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson often intervenes. As she calls the leaders of these groups into her office, she seeks to have an “educational” conversation, focusing on alcohol management at events.
In one such meeting earlier this year, a student organization met with Nelson to discuss dealing with the group’s relationship with alcohol. But within the framework of this discussion, she also handed them material explaining the financial penalties that Northwestern had incurred after the death of a student in an alcohol-related incident and information about the MIT fraternity death. The discussion was about health and safety, but liability, as it often does, loomed in the background.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The smell of frying tuna steak wafted through the Science Center C lecture hall while cheesecake baked in an oven.
As Professor of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics Michael P. Brenner measured the temperature of the two foods as a function of time, he knew he had his audience hooked.
Finally, after he calculated the heat diffusion constant of water with only 10 percent error, a few hungry audience members ate the demonstration.
“I walked out thinking, this is the greatest lecture I have ever given in my life,” Brenner said somewhat playfully of his lesson on heat transfer during Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking”—a course designed for the College’s General Education program.
Creative, innovative, and explicitly connected to the real world, it was a moment that embodied everything that the Gen Ed program stands for.
But when students in the course sat down to do that week’s problem set, many were unable to answer a question based on Brenner’s demonstration.
“I didn’t explain in enough detail why certain steps were true,” he reflected on his lecture. “And if you don’t think this way as a matter of custom, like I do, then it really led to a lot of confusion.”
For many science professors teaching Gen Ed courses, the question of how best to teach scientific concepts to non-science concentrators has no easy answers.
This particular lecture seems to be more of a minor hiccup than indicative of a broader failure of the course, as many administrators and students praised the course’s innovative teaching methods.
“It has taken something students are interested in (food) and used it to teach them some basic scientific principles,” Director of General Education Stephanie H. Kenen wrote in an emailed statement. “If you want to describe what Gen Ed is about, that’s a good course to point to.”
While “Science of Cooking” has been able to draw praise from students and administrators alike, collectively Gen Ed science classes have been less successful at teaching rigorous science within a creative framework, according to some faculty members.
“I worry that too many students are coming through Gen Ed and not achieving the scientific literacy we want them to have,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said. “Students can still graduate from here pretty ignorant in the world of science and that shouldn’t be.”
In  this struggle to teach science to often-reluctant non-science concentrators, a pedagogical divide has emerged.
While some science professors are embracing Gen Ed by using innovative teaching methods, other faculty members have kept their courses—holdovers from the nearly defunct Core Curriculum—virtually unchanged, making only the necessary tweaks to get approval from the Gen Ed committee.
INCONSISTENT PROGRESS
Since its launch in the fall of 2009, the Gen Ed program has dramatically altered the landscape of course offerings at Harvard College. It replaced the 32-year-old Core Curriculum, which will be phased out at the end of the next academic year.
The General Education Office has approved 397 courses, including 91 “new or significantly revised” Core or department courses, according to Tez Chantaruchirakorn, who is program manager of the Program in General Education.
Students must choose from these course offerings to fulfill eight requirements in the humanities, sciences, social sciences, and math.
The Gen Ed curriculum is meant to “connect in an explicit way what students learn in Harvard classrooms to life outside the ivied walls and beyond the college years,” according to the program’s website.
While humanities and social science classes have largely been able to embrace this mission, a number of indicators show that the sciences are lagging behind.
Data from the Q Guide—Harvard’s course evaluation tool—suggests that science and math courses have struggled in the shift from Core to Gen Ed.
Humanities and social sciences classes designed for Gen Ed are scoring higher on average than past Core humanities and social sciences classes.
Not accounting for overall changes in teaching quality across the College, Q scores for humanities and social science courses have jumped from an average of 3.82 in Fall 2007 through Fall 2008 for Core classes to an average of 3.93 among courses numbered in the Gen Ed category in the first three semesters after the new program officially launched.
On the other hand, math and science Q scores saw no significant improvement in the transition from Core to Gen Ed, moving from an average of 3.56 to an average of 3.60 over the same periods.
Although this data only reflects student perception of course quality and may change in upcoming semesters as professors refine new courses, anecdotal evidence from faculty members also suggests that science Gen Ed courses have not lived up to the program’s mission in the same way that humanities and social science courses have.
“I think the science areas were really not thought about nearly as creatively as some of the other areas in Gen Ed,” said Chemistry lecturer Logan S. McCarty ’96, former assistant dean of undergraduate education.
McCarty co-teaches Science of the Physical Universe 20: “What is Life?”
“[The creators of Gen Ed] didn’t really do a whole lot to change the view of what these science courses ought to be.”
RESISTANCE TO CHANGE
One potential explanation for why science Gen Ed classes have failed to show improvement over science Core courses is that many professors have simply re-packaged their Core classes.
Although Kenen said she “[doesn’t] see a lot of aspects of the Core retained in Gen Ed,” some faculty members said that the science courses have seen less change overall, particularly in the Core holdovers that have transitioned into Gen Ed.
“There’s a sense that the way we’ve always taught science is the way to keep teaching it,” McCarty said.
Physics professor Gary Feldman said he didn’t change much about his class when proposed its transition from Core to Gen Ed.
“It really didn’t need a whole lot of change,” he said about his class, which is now called Science of the Physical Universe 18: “Time.”
Feldman said he does not think that many professors drastically altered their science Core courses when switching to Gen Ed.
“We’ve had less change because we’ve been doing a lot of things that Gen Ed wanted all along,” he said.
According to Kenen, the old Core courses that were admitted into the Gen Ed program “already fulfilled the Gen Ed goals.”
For his part, Physics Professor Roy J. Glauber said he did not make any major changes to his Core course Science A-29 before submitting it to the Gen Ed Office.
The class, which is now labeled Physical Universe 23: “The Nature of Light and Matter,” has since been approved.
In his own course, “there was no change in philosophy[the Gen Ed Office] just wanted a lab added,” which he said he had done several years earlier on his own when the course was still in the Core.
Glauber said he thinks science Gen Eds have seen few changes because there are fundamental limitations to the way science can be taught.
“There has not been a world of change because we have a skeleton with a certain amount of rigidity,” he said, adding that he thinks humanities courses are “a great deal more adaptable and flexible” than science courses.
Glauber said he thinks science can be taught according to the Gen Ed philosophy “if its purpose is to interest people and give them experiences that are worth having.”
But, he said, “you cannot really do an honest job of presenting a discipline that way and expect people to understand its ramifications.”
When it comes to presenting rigorous science, he said, “there’s not very much you can do with those equations.”
McCarty said he thinks many of these old courses are not consistent with Gen Ed’s philosophy of imaginative teaching.
“Some of the Core courses that have been converted into Gen Eds, I think, are just not as interesting,” he said.
“I think there’s been less creative effort given to pedagogy and modes of assessments and kinds of projects that students can do.”
MIXED REVIEWS
While some old Core classes have successfully made the transition to Gen Ed, administrators most often point to the newly created classes as the poster children for the new Gen Ed curriculum.
Along with “Science and Cooking,” Harris praised “What is Life?” and Science of Living Systems 12: “Understanding Darwinism”—two new interdisciplinary courses designed specifically for Gen Ed—as courses that “explicitly link to the concerns of students who are not scientists.”
While some new science Gen Ed courses have received high Q score ratings, new Gen Ed science classes are no more likely to receive high Q scores than science Core holdovers that have been approved for Gen Ed—controlling for course-related variables such as instructor quality, difficulty, size, and Gen Ed category.
Only positive professor ratings and designation in the Science of Living Systems category were shown to be connected with a high overall Q score.
Despite receiving positive reviews from faculty members, “Science and Cooking” received an average Q score of 3.77 in Fall 2010, only 16th out of the 32 math and science course offerings listed in the Gen Ed category during the first three semesters after the launch of the program.
Another new course, Science of the Physical Universe 25: “Energy: Perspectives, Problems and Prospects,” earned a 2.83 in Fall 2010, the lowest rating among the 32 course offerings.
Meanwhile, the highest ranked course Science of the Physical Universe 13: “The Physics of Music and Sound,” which received a 4.40 in Fall 2010, is a Gen Ed course that was originally offered in the Core curriculum.
But there is some indication that the Gen Ed philosophy has improved the class. The course instructor, physics professor Eric J. Heller, said he dramatically changed the course to fit the Gen Ed philosophy.
In response to the Gen Ed initiative, Heller adopted the clicker system, moved from Powerpoint presentations to blackboard lectures, implemented in-class peer instruction, and changed the curriculum to make it more quantitative.
Heller said he approaches the challenge of teaching non-science concentrators by regarding them all as “potentially good scientists.”
“I never talk down to any students,” he says, adding that he warns shoppers during the first lecture that his course will be very rigorous.
INSPIRING TEACHERS
Three years from now, in the fifth year of the program, the Gen Ed program will undergo a review to determine how successful it has been in meeting the goals of Gen Ed.
Harris said he expects to use focus groups, Q guide data, and an analyst to assess Gen Ed programming.
But Harris said it could be years before the College has a definitive understanding of how well the long-term goals of the program have been achieved.
As Gen Ed prepares to enter a period with more established courses, some faculty members said that the best way to improve Gen Ed science courses is to draw on the talents of professors.
Some of Harvard’s most committed teachers are grappling with the difficult question of how best to teach science to non-science concentrators, Brenner said.
“The people who teach Gen Ed are by and large very dedicated teachers,” he said.
Brenner adds that he thinks faculty—who are under no obligation to teach Gen Ed—typically only teach Gen Ed courses because they love to teach.
McCarty said he thinks science faculty have enormous potential to teach great courses.
“You really have to somehow inspire the passions of the very creative science faculty we have and really challenge them to think of something outside the box,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Reserve Officers’ Training Corps commissioned three Harvard College seniors as officers in the U.S. armed forces at a ceremony Wednesday, the first since Harvard officially recognized the program after banning it 40 years ago.
The ceremony honored social studies concentrator Christopher W. Higgins ’11, government concentrator Aaron R. Scherer ’11, and economics concentrator James D. Reach ’11. Michael G. Schoenan—a student at the Extension School—also took part in the ceremony but will not take his oath until he finishes his thesis. As part of the ceremony, the students’ families pinned their new ranks to their uniforms.
Major General James C. McConville—recently named the commander of the 101st Airborne Division—delivered the keynote speech at the event.
Though the speakers made little mention of the return of Harvard’s ROTC program—choosing instead to focus on the accomplishments of the men being honored—Faust hinted at the renewed relationship between Harvard and the armed forces.
“I hope that your place in a long and now fully-invigorated Harvard tradition of military service and sacrifice supports and inspires you in the months and years to come,” Faust said, speaking in front of a crowd that spanned the front row sections of Tercentenary Theatre.
This was the fourth ROTC graduation attended by University President Drew G. Faust.
The speakers emphasized that although following a military path may not promise the highest of salaries, the career comes with added benefits.
“No one walks up to a hedge fund manager in the airport and thanks them for their service,” McConville said.
Scherer—who will attend an Arizona-based military intelligence school—is his family’s third son to graduate from Harvard and the third to be commissioned as an Army officer.
Reach will train as an aviator when he graduates, and Higgins will attend the University of Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship.
In total, 19 Harvard undergraduates were enrolled in the program this year.
Faust announced in March that Harvard would officially recognize the Naval chapter of ROTC after Congress repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the military policy which banned gays and lesbians from openly serving the military. While ROTC has not had an outpost on Harvard’s campus since it was banned in the late 1960s, the University has had an agreement in place with MIT since 1976 that allows Harvard students to participate in the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peter R. Girguis and seven of his colleagues in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology currently occupy a work space the size of a traditional master bedroom.
“We’re sort of bursting at the seams,” Girguis says. “We’re pretty cozy.”
Girguis’ constrained work space is, in many ways, an indirect consequence of the indefinite halt on construction of the Allston Science Complex, a project with a $1 billion price tag that was meant to be a hub for interdisciplinary science research.
Harvard began construction on the Allston Science Complex in 2007 as a means of expanding the space accessible to science laboratories. But when the economic crisis of 2008 forced construction in Allston to slow and eventually cease altogether, administrators and faculty across the University scrambled to readjust existing space in Cambridge.
That space now seems to be running out.
“We’re crammed in like sardines,” says Daniel E. Lieberman, chair of the Human Evolutionary Biology department. “If I were an undergraduate, I’d be complaining.”
But with administrators projecting a minimum wait of ten years before laboratories can move to Allston, faculty and students may have to get used to the crunch.
THE MOVE THAT NEVER WAS
The Allston Science Complex was meant to be a mecca for stem cell research, a place where interdisciplinary collaboration would work to solve real scientific and medical problems.
For Douglas A. Melton, co-chair of the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department, collaboration between laboratories, which was part of the University’s vision for Allston, is a key element of the scientific process. “Sparks often fly when you have two scientists right next to each other,” Melton says.
Melton and his colleagues in the SCRB department are currently scattered between the Longwood Medical Campus, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Cambridge campus.
Some of the department’s laboratories were going to be moved to Allston to foster centralization, according to Kathryn L. Link, the executive director of SCRB. With construction in Allston halted, SCRB laboratories have been given two buildings in Cambridge—the Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building and the Bauer Laboratory. These will be occupied in August, when renovations to Fairchild are scheduled to be completed.
“[The labs] will be moving into state of the art facilities. [Fairchild] is a building that will set standards in terms of its greenness,” says Senior Communications Officer for University Science B.D. Colen.
Melton says utilizing the space in Allston would have “allowed for greater growth,” but for now, his department has more than enough space.
“I would expect we would fully occupy this space within a year or two,” Melton says of Fairchild and Bauer.
RESHUFFLING RESEARCH
Accommodating all of the stem cell laboratories in Cambridge has prompted reshuffling­­­—most significantly, the relocation of multiple Molecular and Cellular Biology labs to the Northwest Science Building—that has had indirect implications for even those departments that have not had to move at all.
“There’s less space for other programs to be able to develop and grow,” says Andrew A. Biewener, former chair of the OEB department.
The Northwest Science Building has been a particularly coveted piece of real estate.
“The Northwest space, everyone wanted it,” says Melissa Franklin, physics department chair, adding that the relocation of MCB faculty to Northwest affected physics professors already located in the building. “There was a lot of scrambling about that,” she says.
When it comes to finding more space, professors across the sciences have differing opinions about the options open to them.
“I think there’s space available, for example, that might be able to meet the needs of two investigators who might have the same equipment requirements or physical space requirements. But they might be in two different departments,” Girguis says.
For Girguis, the cost of moving around is also of concern.
“How much money are we going to spend by making local adjustments? Is that sustainable?” Girguis says.
LOOKING AHEAD
Although construction has ceased for now, University Provost Steven E. Hyman says that he is “quite hopeful” that there will be “active Harvard academic programs” in Allston in the next ten to fifteen years. But Hyman says that it is uncertain which departments will move to Allston.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators, the University’s capital campaign is planning to raise money with Allston as a top priority.
The time frame within which laboratories can expect to move to Allston, however, is not definite, according to a senior FAS administrator.
“Our main attention is making a beehive of activity here in the fall. We do not think of this as temporary housing,” Melton says.
Franklin, whose physics department is spread out over seven buildings, says that there is a charm to staying on this side of the river that in some ways outweighs the potential for increased space and centralization that Allston provides.
“Five years ago if you asked our faculty, they would not want to go to Allston. Maybe that has changed now,” she says. “They like it here. They like the trees, they like the really bad food at Greenhouse ... These people really like students—undergrads.”
But with student interest in the sciences seeing consistent growth and departments seeking new faculty appointments, there is little doubt that changes in arrangements will have to be made soon.
“To end this game of musical chairs, somebody has to leave,” says Lieberman. “What’s very frustrating is that we do not have the resources that we need. It’s just not right for our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Comedian Amy Poehler—a former cast member of “Saturday Night Live” and the current star of NBC’s “Parks and Recreation”—encouraged the members of the class of 2011 to always allow themselves to lean on others and be open to new ideas at Wednesday afternoon’s Class Day Exercises.
Ivy Orator Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11 introduced Poehler as “the blonde Tina Fey,” which earned him a middle finger from Poehler.
In her speech, Poehler offered the senior class advice that she learned while studying improv in Chicago.
“Listen, say yes, live in the moment, make sure you play with people who have your back, make big choices early and often, and don’t start a scene with two people talking about jumping out of a plane—start it already having jumped out,” she said.
Held in Tercentenary Theatre the day before Commencement, Class Day is a College-wide ceremony that audience members said was a humorous yet meaningful afternoon.
The event also included speeches from the first and second Class Marshals, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and four student speakers—two serious Harvard Orators and two humorous Ivy Orators.
In her fifteen minute speech, Poehler also spoke more seriously of the world events that have shaped the experiences of the graduating class, including 9/11.
“During these tough times we realized how wonderful it felt to be part of a group,” she said.
Poehler ended her speech with lyrics from Outkast’s “Hey Ya,” after reiterating her point about the importance of being open to others.
“Don’t treat your heart like an action figure, wrapped in plastic and never used,” she said.
Audience members said that Poehler and the four student speakers struck the right balance between humor and practical life advice.
“I didn’t expect her to be serious at all,” Katerina Mantzavinou ’11 said of Poehler’s speech.
In Cambridge to see his daughter Elizabeth graduate, John W. McLeod said that the student speeches were as insightful as Poehler’s.
A major theme of the afternoon was how to live up to—or, perhaps, embrace not living up to—the pressures of a Harvard degree.
Ivy Orator Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11 traced the portrayal of Harvard students in movies ranging from “Legally Blonde” to “How High,” a comedy in which two rappers are admitted to Harvard after smoking magical marijuana.
“It’s a lot to live up to,” she said of the Harvard diploma. “I suspect I’m not alone in feeling suspiciously less erudite.”
But the ultimate message of Fitzpatrick’s speech echoed another theme of the afternoon, gratitude.
“The great thing about ‘How High,’ about all of these portrayals of Harvard and its students, is that they help us remember just how special our experiences have been,” Fitzpatrick said.
First Class Marshal Samuel B. Novey ’11 ended the ceremony with a challenge for the class of 2011, inviting them to speak out against the problems they see in the world.
He told the audience that the world is a better place because new generations consistently “ask why things have to be the way they are,” quoting his mother’s reflections after reading a draft of his sociology thesis this winter.
“If we’re lucky enough to return for our 70th reunion, we will have to be ready to answer to the graduating class of 2081,” Novey said.

Actor Alec Baldwin struck a somber tone at Harvard Law School’s Class Day Wednesday, urging graduates to use their intelligence to solve the nation’s biggest problems.
Baldwin spoke at the end of the program, which honored the individual accomplishments of more than a dozen graduating law students. He challenged the graduates to bring morality to the law, calling on the class to take on some of the nation’s biggest challenges by pursuing careers in government.
Baldwin, who has received critical acclaim for his role in the NBC comedy “30 Rock,” has performed in movies, on television, and on the stage for more than 20 years. Despite his success in acting, Baldwin said he wishes he had pursued a career as a lawyer, as he has found his pursuit of social change is “limited by preconceptions” of Hollywood.
“If I had to do it all over again, I would do it differently,” Baldwin said. “I believe I would trade what I have for what you’ll have come tomorrow afternoon.”
Baldwin said that, as a child, he always dreamed of becoming a lawyer.
“I wanted to be President of the United States, so I needed to get my hands on a law degree. Nearly every day since then, I wondered what would [have happened] if I had the patience, skill, or good fortune.”
Baldwin told graduates who were going into private practice that “there’s nothing wrong with a little commerce,” but that, as an actor, he has learned that earnings increase the more one moves away from the most meaningful theater. “The money tends to go up the farther you get from Shakespeare and Chekhov, Williams and O’Neill,” he said.
The keynote address followed a myriad of accolades awarded to graduating third years for accomplishments in public service, leadership, citizenship, and compassion. A staff appreciation award and an award for teaching excellence were also given.
A new addition to the program was The William J. Stuntz Memorial Award for Justice, Human Dignity, and Compassion, which commemorates a former HLS professor who died of cancer earlier this year at age 52.
“He transformed study of criminal justice,” Law School Dean Martha Minow said.
“I think anyone who knew him was reminded to be a better self because of him,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looks like it’s been an iconic part of the Harvard skyline forever, but just over ten years ago, the distinctive Gothic tower that crowns Memorial Hall was missing.
Now featured on countless postcards sold in Harvard Sq., until 1999 the tower was a shell of its former self, having been razed by a fire in 1956. For over 40 years, Memorial Hall went without its most grandiose feature.
In 1999, when Harvard stood on the verge of wrapping up a record-breaking capital campaign—a massive six-year-long fundraising effort that collected over $2.6 billion for the University—administrators finally took steps toward restoring the structure.
That tower—the red-brick structure that beckons to posing tourists and prospective students—now stands as a symbol of the major projects and changes that can be ushered in by a concentrated University fundraising effort, known as a capital campaign.
The University’s last such campaign, in addition to the eye-catching renovation of Memorial Hall, also paid for the new computer science building Maxwell Dworkin, the transformation of the Freshman Union into the Barker Center, and a large expansion of undergraduate financial aid.
Now, after a series of false starts and delays, Harvard has quietly begun a new capital campaign, which is expected to raise an even larger sum and to reshape the face of the University once again. This campaign is set to alter the landscape of Harvard by funding renovations to the twelve undergraduate Houses and by bankrolling the University’s long-awaited expansion in Allston.
WRITING A WISH LIST
With a new campaign underway, the University is determining the major items that will be funded by the campaign’s proceeds.
The dean of each school in the University has been asked to submit a memo outlining the projects in his or her school that could benefit from campaign funding. Faust and her advisors will then cull suggestions from these memos in order to create the final list of beneficiary projects.
Several administrators have said that House renewal, a potentially sweeping renovation project to the twelve undergraduate Houses that will start with major updates to Old Quincy next year, will be the foremost priority of the entire campaign.
Construction in Allston will also be a focus of the upcoming campaign, according to many top administrators.
It remains unclear what will be built in Allston, where the University originally planned to put a neighborhood of student housing and even broke ground on a state-of-the-art science complex—all of which was scrapped, at least temporarily, when the financial crisis gutted the University’s endowment, a reversal that angered residents and has soured town-gown relations for the foreseeable future.
But administrators have made assurances that the capital campaign, which was also postponed due to the dismal economy, will mark the end of the standstill in building across the Charles River brought on by the recession.
Provost Steven E. Hyman said that Allson construction will “absolutely” be a priority in the upcoming campaign, adding “I don’t think we have much choice at this point.”
“It certainly will be a part of the campaign, and our aspirations are tied to Allston,” Faust said.
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
A capital campaign comes with an overarching theme, specific projects that it aims to finance, and a set monetary target—all announced in glossy promotional materials.
But before that public program is ever rolled out, over a third of the money has already been gathered through hushed solicitation of major contributions, which in development lingo is a period known as the “quiet phase.”
This year, Harvard entered that phase, kick-starting the enormous initiative with little fanfare.
Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 said that Harvard would set a “very ambitious goal” for the campaign.
Administrators say that a fundraising goal has not been determined yet, but according to Steven Oliveira, dean for development and alumni relations at Harvard Law School, the total will likely top $4 billion.
“Odds are that this will be the largest campaign in higher education,” Oliveira said, adding that Harvard’s campaign will likely collect a sum “in the $4 billion range ... and very possibly beyond that.”
Rogers has said that schools gather as much as 40 percent of the campaign total during the quiet phase, which according to Oliveira will last for more than two years and will be followed by a five-year public campaign. That timeline puts the University on track to publicly launch the campaign around 2013 and to wrap up the fundraising drive around 2018.
Remarking on the last campaign—which was the first time the entire University pulled together instead of the individual campaigns each school had hosted in the past—Rogers indicated that one in this decade would again be a University-wide effort.
“Since we truly want to do the absolute best research, recruit the absolute best students, and give them the absolute best experience, we have to think University-wide for the next campaign. All of the schools are participating in the planning process,” Rogers said in an emailed statement.
A DRIVE DEFERRED
The books had barely closed on Harvard’s last capital campaign—which, at its conclusion in 1999, was the most lucrative ever in the history of higher education—when the University began considering its next go-round, an effort that would be aborted and stalled on multiple occasions.
In 2002, Hyman said that the University was mulling strategies for a potential campaign. By 2004, The Crimson reported that the campaign was set to start that year. Soon, the initial fundraising—the quiet phase—was underway.
But in 2005, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers came under fire from the faculty for remarks deemed offensive to women. Amidst the scrutiny, the campaign’s public launch was pushed back.
After Summers’ ignominious resignation, the campaign was put off until a new president could take office. But after Faust’s appointment, a deep recession struck. Again, Harvard’s first campaign of the 21st century failed to launch.
Now, with Faust ensconced in Massachusetts Hall and donors’ wallets fattening as the economy recuperates, the long-awaited campaign has at last quietly taken off.

In his address to students and families at the Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday, University Professor Paul E. Farmer challenged graduates to find ways to incorporate compassion and persistence into the development of future public policies. Drawing upon his experience in the aftermath of the Jan. 2010 earthquakes in Haiti, Farmer emphasized the importance of investment in and attachment to humanitarian projects, a concept he dubbed “accompaniment.”
“All that I have to offer you today turns about the notion of accompaniment,” he said to the audience. “It is an elastic term, but here it means sticking to a task until it is deemed completed by the person that you are accompanying.”
Farmer acknowledged that the concept could initially appear unrelated to government, but said that it has far-reaching implications. He asked graduates to consider the potential increase in the effectiveness of humanitarian aid that is executed according to the notion of accompaniment.
“Many of you here will be soon leading foreign contractors and NGOs—if you are not already—and you will need to help these organizations find a way to accompany our developing partners and intended beneficiaries away from deprivation and suffering,” he said.
“Just because we can’t tangibly measure the value of accompaniment, doesn’t mean that we can’t use it in the service of the common good,” Farmer added.
Farmer—a medical anthropologist and physician—is primarily known for his humanitarian work as a co-founder of the global health non-profit organization Partners In Health. In 2009, Farmer was also appointed to the position of United Nations Deputy Special Envoy to Haiti.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 told the audience that Farmer’s humanitarian work in the region is only one part of a long and significant career devoted to helping the poor.
“He has always made a commitment to instituting enduring changes,” Ellwood said of Farmer. “He has helped build structures, foundations, and institutions that will lead us to a better world.”
Farmer concluded his address by emphasizing to the graduates that the knowledge gained within the classroom must be accompanied by individual initiative.
“The greatest lesson that I took from the [Haiti] earthquake is that expertise will not solve all of the problems that we have today,” he said. “I hope that you will take this to heart as you are all already leaders, already accomplished, and—in being at the Kennedy School—deemed to make a great impact with the skills that you have garnered here.”

Speaking in front of a packed audience in Piper Auditorium at the Harvard Graduate School of Design’s Class Day, Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) Curator Chris Anderson encouraged the graduating class to pursue knowledge and to never stop learning.
“Don’t pursue your passion directly,” he said. “Instead, pursue the things that impel you to pursue knowledge. Be relentlessly curious, forever.”
Anderson discussed three integral components of talent—imagination, innovation, and invention—that he said have made human progress possible.
He said the graduates, who will receive their diplomas tomorrow during Commencement exercises, are about to spend the rest of their lives devoted to the mission of “nurturing the thrilling life of the world of ideas,” Anderson said.
“You are not just going to dream about it,” he said. “You are actually going to turn it in to reality.”
For an idea to become real, Anderson added, it needs to spread from brain to brain through effective communication.
“It strikes me as a complete tragedy when people have powerful ideas that turn into gibberish and make their brains go numb because they can’t articulate their ideas,” he said. “Whatever you do, find a way to communicate.”
Anderson, a British journalist who was born in Pakistan and spent his childhood in Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan, studied at Oxford University and founded Future Publishing before joining TED in 2001.
According to Harvard Graduate School of Design Career Services, 84 percent of alumni enter a profession in architecture or design.
This is the eighth year the Design school has invited a speaker, chosen by the graduating class, to speak at Class Day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after being hired as president and CEO of the Harvard Management Company, Jane L. Mendillo received a present from her staff: the jaws of life.
In that one year, Mendillo had managed to salvage Harvard’s assets from the most violent market crash since the Great Depression, and the hydraulic rescue tool was meant to symbolize Mendillo’s swift rescue effort.
Mendillo had barely moved into her office in the Boston Federal Reserve building since starting the job on July 1, 2008, when financial markets experienced the most serious downturn since the Great Depression.
As some market indices fell more than 54 percent, HMC’s holdings took a serious hit, depressing the University’s endowment value by nearly 30 percent.
But through a series of fast trades, Mendillo managed to extricate the endowment from the most serious effects of the market crash. Now that the dust has settled, Mendillo will begin implementing her vision for the portfolio.
Mendillo’s HMC is a stark break from the company of the past. With the departure of Jack R. Meyer, HMC lost its 14-year veteran leader—who chafed at the negative press coverage of large multi-million dollar salaries but simultaneously quintupled the endowment with double-digit returns.
Today, HMC has repositioned itself to take more responsibility for guaranteeing the University’s budgetary needs, and has abandoned its image as a one-client hedge fund.
Mendillo’s efforts to reduce liquidity risk, reevaluate compensation, and restructure its internal organization are emblematic of a new chapter in HMC’s history in which the CEO has become a more cautious custodian of Harvard’s wealth.
CIRCLING FOR PREY
During Meyer’s reign as HMC’s storied—if somewhat maverick—CEO, a stuffed, toy vulture hung above the trading floor. The vulture was installed after an external hedge fund manager once called HMC a “vulture investor” in a heated dispute.
Indeed, under Meyer’s leadership, the endowment generated hawkish returns and grew nearly fivefold, from $4.7 billion to $22.6 billion to the astonishment of the academic world and to the envy of many traders on Wall Street.
Meyer attributed the fund’s strong returns during that time to aggressive strategies pursued by the company’s internal investment team. At the same time, the fund outsourced some portfolio management to external hedge funds, recognizing market opportunities.
When Meyer joined HMC, 70 percent of the fund was internally managed. When he left, 50 percent was still in-house. Currently, that number rests at 30 percent, according to Stephen Blyth, HMC’s managing director and head of internal management.
Most other universities hand over their endowments entirely to external money managers.
At the time, Meyer said, “I think the endowment actually offers a higher rate of return for the same amount of risk.”
Accordingly, HMC portfolio managers were paid handsomely, with salaries that outpaced any other paid individual in higher education and rivaled some on Wall Street.
But those salaries also contributed to Meyer’s ignominious departure from HMC.
In 2003, outrage erupted among Harvard alumni when it became public that HMC’s two top earners were earning around $35 million per year. Though that number dropped to $25 million in 2004, the scandal over salaries persisted.
“I don’t apologize at all for the compensation system,” Meyer said in a recent interview with The Crimson. “But it was an enormously difficult situation for Harvard. You don’t want the tail wagging the dog, and HMC was the tail.”
Though Meyer said he felt the principles underlying the system were valid, the dispute nonetheless strained relations between HMC and the rest of the University.
“We were a little less involved with people at the University than I would have liked,” Meyer said. The controversy over compensation “tended to poison relationships.” According to Meyer, he would have liked to have a more productive relationship with those across the river, “but we couldn’t because everyone was mad about compensation,”
Openly frustrated by increasing media scrutiny of endowment managers’ salaries and ready to move on after nearly 15 years at the helm of HMC, Meyer left the company to start his own hedge fund, bringing 30 of the 175 staff members with him.
Meyer’s successor, Mohamed A. El-Erian, mused that he inherited a car without an engine, according to an individual with ties to the company.
But Meyer said that he was very conscious of this concern when he departed. Meyer said he assumed that HMC would be moving away from the type of fixed income strategy used by the team he took with him.
“We thought we left it in great shape,” Meyer said.
Mendillo has since enacted changes to the compensation structure to encourage long-term thinking and diligence.
“Everyone who wants to work here knows that our compensation structure has to be uniquely well-aligned with the University,” Mendillo said in an interview with The Crimson. “And if they don’t meet their markers, they stand to lose their bonuses.”
Compensation for many HMC investors is performance-based, and over 90 percent of compensation paid to portfolio managers is variable, based on investment performance, according to a May press release.
Mendillo also made the company’s “clawback” policy more robust, extending the number of years that compensation is subject to review.
Additionally, HMC’s senior management team’s compensation is now linked to performance of the overall endowment portfolio. Caps have been adopted to limit the amount of compensation a manager receives in any year when the endowment has a negative nominal return.
Mendillo admitted that the system was “unusual” but stuck to the promise that “no bonus is earned unless the market benchmark is beaten.”
During calendar year 2009, the top-earner at HMC was Blyth, who received roughly $8.4 million. Mendillo earned $3,498,269.
CRISIS MODE
During the financial downturn, Mendillo and her staff began each day at 7 a.m. with a crisis meeting.
At the time—late 2008 and into 2009—the University’s endowment began to take a turn for the worse as markets plummeted and Harvard’s investments in exotic financial instruments began to backfire. The aggressive investment strategies pushed by Meyer—what inspired the vulture’s placement on a central spot of the trading floor—would turn sour. Now, the company did not need a vulture at the company’s helm but a rescue worker—someone equipped with the jaws of life.
When Mendillo attended her first board meeting in June 2008 as head of the company, the board began to detect the initial signs of catastrophe.
By the second board meeting that September, Lehman Brothers was only days away from its bankruptcy, and its  subsequent demise devastated financial markets.
As the economy imploded, the endowment suffered repeated jolts, fluctuating in value each day by $700 million to nearly $1 billion.
The high volatility intensified transactions and tension on the trading floor and in the company’s hallways as Mendillo quickly unloaded some of Harvard’s private equity holdings in secondary markets, selling at discounted rates as supply overburdened the market and depressed prices.
Private equity—the purchase of a company then restructuring it and trying to sell it at a profit—is an illiquid asset class, as firms can often take five years to implement their reforms.
In her earlier capacity as the head of Wellesley’s investment office, Mendillo had shed Wellesley’s holdings in private equity just months before joining HMC. But those transactions would prove difficult to replicate as financial markets froze and buyers fled from exchanges.
“Literally the first day after I joined, I had a meeting on selling some private equity assets,” said Mendillo.
Though these markdown transactions appeared to be a series of quick-fire sales, in reality it was a calculated strategy to increase immediate liquidity—or the ability to convert investments into cash—and to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities of overpricing of private equity, according to annual reports.
When Mendillo, six months into her post as CEO, stood in front of the HMC board for their first meeting since the low-point of the financial crisis, board members knew much of the news she would report. By the end of the fiscal year, the endowment would plunge sharply, decreasing in value by a stunning 27.3 percent to $26 billion. Though she was about to present the worst returns in Harvard’s history, she remained calm and collected during the quarterly meeting.
“I think Jane has proven to be a terrific leader. She is calm, she is cool, she is rational, she is decisive in a tough spot. She is someone you want with you in the foxhole,” said Glenn Hutchins ’77, a member of HMC’s board and the co-founder of Silver Lake, a private equity firm.
Meyer said that this demeanor is characteristic of Mendillo, calling her “deceptively tough.”
“She is soft spoken and you think, ‘what a nice person.’ But she is very firm in her decision-making and a very good negotiator,” Meyer said.
HMC—which previously had beat out its benchmarks consistently—fell behind those standards by 2.1 percent, and the annual report noted that “with a few notable exceptions, nearly every asset class did poorly.”
Roughly five miles away from the HMC offices, in a packed Faculty Room in University Hall, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith asked departments and centers to cut their respective budgets by 10 to 15 percent.
Harvard cut budgets severely, laid off 275 employees, and eliminated hot breakfast for undergraduates.
Realizing the extent of its crunch in income, Harvard said that it would “assess its alternatives” with regard to the Allston Science Complex. Finally in December 2009, University President Drew G. Faust announced the University would halt its construction in Allston, and it soon after paved over the site with concrete.
SHIFTING GEARS
To many observers it came as a surprise that the world’s richest university would have to make budgetary cuts in the wake of the financial crisis. The reality of budget cuts brought home the very real impacts of risky investment strategies as it became clear in 2009 that a large part of the budget cuts were required because the endowment returns yielded barely enough cash to meet the university’s short term financial obligations.
With the advent of the crisis, HMC retooled its investment strategy to increase liquidity while still maintaining a similar portfolio of holdings, which translated to a similar market risk.
Higher liquidity results in greater flexibility in serious downturns, granting the University easier access cash in a tight spot. Mendillo said in early 2010 that HMC’s need to know about the short-term resources of the University was “lit up in bright lights” during the financial crisis.
The more conservative strategies were a far-cry from some of the aggressive investment approaches of Meyer’s days.
“Historically, we took the view that endowments could simply focus on long-term financial results, and the University would take care of short-term business,” Mendillo said in 2010. “We know now that it is all shared business.”
That year, Faust formed a new committee to oversee and reevaluate the University’s risk return profile in terms of the University’s changing goals and needs in an effort to tie HMC more closely to the rest of the University.
Partly as a result of more cautious investing, HMC posted an overall 11 percent investment return and the endowment edged upwards from $26.1 billion to $27.6 billion.
According to Meyer, Mendillo gets “high marks” in handling the crisis and personnel difficulties. “No one can dispute that,” he said. “Now she is in phase two, making this portfolio her own. My bet is that she will get good marks in phase two.”
But Harvard’s endowment returns still lag behind its peer institutions. Princeton boasted a 15 percent investment return while Columbia topped the Ivies with a 17 percent yield last fiscal year.
These changing investment strategies mark a dramatic departure from Meyer’s profit-maximizing approach and a shift in philosophy toward focusing on best serving the University’s needs­—even if it means lower but more reliable annualized returns.
“What is more important—beating our peers’ annual returns, or generating long-term growth with manageable volatility?” Mendillo asked in 2010, capturing the friction in evolution of HMC’s identity.
NEW DRIVETRAIN
The exodus of traders that followed Meyer out of HMC left the company’s investment team in limbo. Since Mendillo arrived she has made retooling the company’s administrative structure a priority alongside realigning its investments.
Steady attrition among its portfolio managers, who left one by one to start their own hedge funds, was a major source of concern within the company but began to subside when Blyth, the top internal investor, stayed on.
With Blyth serving as the investment team’s core member, Mendillo recruited new talent to HMC and built up an experienced equity team. Neil Mason, for example, was appointed to the position of chief risk officer.
According to Blyth, Mendillo may be moving away from relying on external money managers, choosing to bolster the internal team to incrementally take responsibility for a greater portion of the endowment going forward.
But Mendillo was not afraid to make necessary cuts, letting go a number of HMC employees to rein in operating costs.
Mendillo’s end goal was to better align HMC to future investment opportunities across the entire market and to bring each of the portfolio management teams into sync, according to a speech she gave in 2010.
In response to its catastrophic year, HMC said it would consider shifting its focus to areas in which it had a competitive advantage, such as fixed income, a field that focuses mainly on periodic real returns like bond markets. Another area that it is focusing more heavily on is real assets, an area that includes investments like gold, land, and other commodities.
As Mendillo now mobilizes to the future—what Meyer called “Phase 2” of Mendillo’s tenure as the head of HMC—she will now mold the portfolio into her own.
Beyond investing more heavily in these two areas, Mendillo hopes to increase expertise in emerging markets.
Apparently overcoming one of the most severe downturns in Harvard’s financial history, Mendillo is optimistic about the future.
“It was a very rocky period for the portfolio, and it was a lot of hard work,” she said. “But we are focused on drawing strong long-term returns where you think that the opportunities lie in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Using a Business School degree to make a difference in the world was the theme of multiple speeches at the Harvard Business School Class Day ceremony, celebrated Wednesday afternoon.
Business School alumna Kathryn E. Giusti urged graduating students to take risks, persevere, and partner wisely when working toward achieving their goals.
Giusti recalled her graduation 25 years earlier and said she felt insecure knowing that, contrary to expectations, she did not intend to have a business career.
“But I stand here today in front of all of you as an entrepreneur,” said Giusti.
Giusti said her plans underwent a dramatic change when she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a fatal blood cancer. The doctors said she would only have three years to survive.
“But that was sixteen years ago,” Giusti said.
She explained to students that her Business School education provided her with the necessary resources that guided her in starting her own business.
Giusti—the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium—said she was motivated by the desire to see her daughter go to kindergarten.
“Don’t wait for a cancer diagnosis to do something amazing with your life,” Giusti said.
Jacqueline R. Sandberg, a student in the graduating class, also spoke about her experience with management education and its impact on her career goals in her class day speech.
With a combination of humor and personal anecdotes, Sandberg—who says she plans on pursuing her dream of becoming a comedy writer—urged the members of the graduating class to use their education to impact others for the better.
Sandberg arrived at the Business School with little formal entrepreneurial training. She had worked in the strategic marketing department for eHarmony.com and founded her own weekly publication, Local.
She noted she does not feel there is a clear definition of a successful path after graduating from Business School, but she was reminded of the advice her father gave her on her first day of college at the University of Virginia, which was to “do good.”
“We all expect to do well, but it is my hope that you all do good,” Sandberg told the audience. “We can try to do good with the people we care about the most by letting them know they’re the people we care about the most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stuart A. Levey ’85 says that in his frequent visits to the Coffee Connection—a coffee joint in the Garage and a staple in the Harvard community—there was always a familiar face.
Harvard lecturer Martin “Marty” H. Peretz made his home at a corner table, where it seemed like he was always surrounded by students.
Levey says Peretz, his undergraduate thesis adviser, preferred the cafe’s palpable exchange of ideas to his confined university office.
“That was where he would stay and hold court,” Levey says.
Levey, who wrote his thesis on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, remembers Peretz as a “warm” adviser who encouraged his personal interest in the region.
“He was unusual among faculty members in his interest in mentoring and getting to know students,” he says.
But in September, some members of the Harvard community protested against Harvard’s relation to a professor known for his controversial viewpoints.
The Committee on Degrees in Social Studies was to mark its 50th anniversary with a speech from Peretz and the establishment of a $650,000 fund for student research in his name.
Yet just weeks before, Peretz  published a blog post that included a declaration that Muslims should not be extended First Amendment privileges and that “Muslim life is cheap.” Critics said that these most recent comments form part of a 30-year history of issuing hateful language towards blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and Muslims.
Following days of public opposition across campus, Peretz was removed from the list of speakers. But the committee still recognized Peretz among past leaders in Social Studies and accepted the fund in his name.
Widely criticized for his inflammatory comments, Peretz is fiercely defended by loyal colleagues and former students who continue to commend him for his dedication to Harvard and the world of academia.
A CONTROVERSIAL MENTOR
One classmate of his at Brandeis University remembers Peretz’s attempts to build connections with professors.
“He was always just pure ambition,” Harvey Pressman says. “A smart kid, but not someone that you would want as a friend.”
Peretz graduated from Bronx High School of Science in 1955. Following his undergraduate days at Brandeis, Peretz crossed the Charles and set himself to his goal of prospering in academia.
At Harvard, he received a Masters in 1965 and completed his doctoral thesis in government a year later to obtain his Ph.D. The University recognized his enthusiasm, retaining him as a lecturer in the recently-established but selective Social Studies concentration where he would serve as head tutor between 1967 and 1971.
In his academic role and his subsequent position as South House Master, former South House Committee Co-President Nancy E. Toff ’76 says that Peretz developed close relationships with his students.
“He always had a coterie around him,” she says. “It was an intellectual coterie, however, and mostly consisted of students within the Social Studies department.”
According to some of these students, Peretz was a decisive influence on their intellectual pursuits and career paths.
MIT Professor Sherry R. Turkle ’69 says she embarked on her initial research following Peretz’s encouragement. He told her that the her seemingly esoteric interest in French scholars’ indifference towards Freudian theory could in fact lead to a compelling senior thesis.
“Dr. Peretz was a great teacher and gave me confidence in my abilities at a time when I needed that,” she says. “He encouraged me to have confidence in myself and to become an academic when this seemed to me to be a great reach.”
Peretz left Harvard in 1975 to head up The New Republic, a political magazine that he had purchased a year earlier. He would remain there as editor-in-chief through 2010, helping mold the magazine’s liberal slant and hawkish approach to American foreign policy.
But Peretz all the while retained his ties to the University and, in 1993, he contributed to the establishment of the Martin Peretz Chair in Yiddish Literature.
E. J. Dionne ’73, a former student of Peretz’s, says that the professor’s unique capacity to engage with his students led to the support for him that endures despite his controversial statements.
“Many of us wish Marty had not written some of the things he wrote and we told him that,” Dionne says. “But for me at least—and I know lots of others who feel this way—it was simply impossible to forget, ignore, or write off Marty’s passion for his students, his eagerness to help us, how much energy he put into his teaching, and how he stayed connected to people after they graduated.”
CONFLICTING LEGACIES
The clash between his dueling legacies came to the forefront in the days leading up to the Social Studies celebration in September.
Turkle and Dionne had joined 43 others, including former Vice President Al Gore ’69, in soliciting support for the $650,000 Martin Peretz Undergraduate Research Fund. The fund was in honor of “an inspiring teacher, mentor, and scholar who was an architect and steward of the Social Studies program from the 1960s through the early 1990s.”
Primarily devoted to juniors pursuing thesis research, the fund gives priority to social or political theorists and those studying either multiculturalism, social justice, or inequality.
But when word of the fund spread, many said that, given Peretz’s history of controversial views, the University was sending the wrong message in accepting the fund.
Leading up to the conference, a five-day debate erupted in which over 550 people—including Social Studies concentrators, alumni, graduate students, and staff members as well as presidents of student support groups—petitioned against accepting the fund.
The Undergraduate Council condemned the University’s decision to accept the funds with a vote of 26-7-4.
“This is about the University decision-making going against the grain of its stated values and objectives, and this decision has affected all of us negatively,” says Maryam M. Gharavi, a doctoral student in comparative literature who participated in the protests.
The protesters said that the academic pursuits that would be financed by the fund would be overshadowed by Peretz’s extremist views and would only advance his derogatory statements.
“They’re essentially expressing to the University community and the world that Peretz’s racist agenda forever linked to this award ... will nonetheless be carried forward,” Gharavi said.
Director of Studies Anya Bernstein announced in April that fund recipients would remain anonymous. Those students can report their association with the umbrella Harvard College Research Program funding source rather than the Peretz fund.
“It suggests that the department and the University have something to hide. So much for academic freedom and transparency if they allow shady donors to dictate research agendas,” says Sam L. Sternin ’01, who helped organize the alumni petition and letter-writing campaign online.
“They should just rename the fund or return the money and save themselves the embarrassment and shame that this secret award bears.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ashwin Kaja’s big idea has reached communities like Oaxaca, Mexico, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Providing tours for individuals to meet and invest in entrepreneurs in poor communities, his non-profit—Investours—is a first-world start-up with the aim of helping third-world start-ups.
Kaja is not only a founder and director of Investours, he is also a third year student at Harvard Law School, a tutor in Kirkland House,
and a part of a growing trend at the Law School—budding entrepreneurs.
Law School Dean Martha Minow has made a point of encouraging students to make their own jobs, and Kaja is part of a burgeoning group of students at the Law School to leave behind traditional corporate careers in favor of self-made start-ups. Minow’s initiative includes introducing a range of courses pertaining to entrepreneurship with titles like “Law and Finance of Start-Up Companies,” but she also faces the challenge of convincing students to forsake lucrative careers in big law firms.
To try and meet that challenge, Minow introduced plans last year for what is called the Public Service Venture Fund. Debuting in 2013, the fund will give “seed money”—as little as a few thousands dollars to as much as $80,000—to students to establish non-profit start-ups.
While the Law School has made progress toward encouraging enterprising projects, students say that the initiative remains hampered by a lack of coordination across the University and a paucity of incubator courses. By breaking down barriers between schools, they say, students would be able to easily tap the resources they require.
Professor David M. Hornik has watched the Law School take this important first step to incorporate more entrepreneurial material in the curriculum—both since he was a student two decades ago and since he began teaching at the Law School.
“In the early 90s, I don’t think there was any focus on entrepreneurship,” Hornick says. “It was certainly not clear that lawyers would participate in entrepreneurship.”
After law school, Hornick worked for a law firm in California that represented Internet start-ups like Yahoo and Google. He says that on the West Coast, entrepreneurship has always been a more accepted career path, and law students consider entrepreneurship a suitable future along with public service or private practice. But now, he says, things are changing.
A venture capitalist himself, he says his class “Entrepreneurship and Company Building” has more than tripled in size since he began teaching it four years ago.  Of the hundreds of students who have taken the class, Hornick says some of his students have since started their own businesses, including a former student that started a child’s clothing and toy swap business.
“In regards to the law school, there’s a lot more focus on the opportunities available to graduates in the realm of entrepreneurship,” Hornick says.
But some student entrepreneurs say that accepting and fostering young entrepreneurs involves more than just changing the curriculum. While the classes on venture law, starting companies, and finance law are helpful, Kaja says that that’s only one layer of a multi-dimensional program the law school needs to develop.
“The thing is, starting a company is not just one thing—we’re a non-profit with very specific needs and so learning and taking a venture law class isn’t really helpful.”
Kaja says that once students become interested in launching their own project, they need a place to plan and network for their businesses—a step the Law School has not yet taken that Kaja calls “practically enabling entrepreneurship.” The MIT Sloan School of Management has a good model for these classes, Kaja says.
“A lot of business schools have incubators, where you actually go put together team, put together a business plan, and churn out real businesses,” Kaja says. “There’s something in that model for the Law School to consider.”
To receive this training, students often look outside the walls of the Law School.
Alain Goubau, a third year at the Law School, cross registered at MIT as a second year and took an incubator-style class called “Energy Ventures”. As a result of contacts he made and ideas he helped form during the course, Goubau co-founded Altaeros Energies—a company that is developing a novel kind of wind turbine.
“Taking that class [and] working yourself through a business plan for three months really forces you to think a lot,” Goubau says. He adds after the class was over he said to himself, “Now that we’ve thought about it, let’s try it.”
He said that meeting students with similar interests was a bonus of the class, noting that the first three weeks of class seemed like “speed dating” as students met and discussed their ideas. The interaction did not stop there. Students—a mix of policy, business, and engineering students—openly critiqued their peers’ ideas, using the course as a forum to discover the most practical and efficient ideas regarding renewable energy sources.
Kaja says the Law School should support this kind of programming, in addition to the foundational classes already offered.
“They’re still at the initial stages of setting [the program] up,” Kaja says. “It’s really important as they lay the groundwork for supporting entrepreneurship [to realize] that entrepreneurship is fundamentally a practical thing. It’s incredibly important steps that they’re taking to practically enabling entrepreneurship. That’s what made the incubator classes at Sloan so successful.”
Robb London, a spokesperson for the Law School, says that some courses introduced to teach entrepreneurship do touch on business planning but that students can and are encouraged to cross-register at Harvard Business School. David N. Back, a second year at the Law School, however, says that cross registering puts an unnecessarily large burden on the student to negotiate with teachers and administrators across schools and that schedules are not always lined up.
While Sloan-style incubator classes may not be offered at the Law School, Harvard has announced plans for a forum for students across the University to meet and discuss ideas earlier this year. The Innovation Lab, a new program that will open later this year at the Business School, aims to facilitate interaction between students with similar entrepreneurial dreams.
But one program like the Innovation Lab is not enough, according to Back. Back, who is working on a project involving transportation in India, says that though the Law School has begun to offer more courses and bring in more faculty specializing in entrepreneurship, it is still a relatively “small niche” at the Law School. He says the University—not the Law School—is holding back the entrepreneurial potential of students.
“The wealth of knowledge at Harvard is so extremely and unfortunately segmented,” Back says. “It needs to increase student collaboration.”
Back says he believes that the University should facilitate a larger program for entrepreneurship across all schools, hence enabling cross-school projects. For one start-up, he suggested, an architect at the Design School could work with a real estate specialist at the Business School, a budding real estate attorney at the Law School, and a city planning and urban development specialist at the Kennedy school.
Though he agrees that the Innovation Lab will start that kind of collaboration, Back says he hopes collaboration can be facilitated by reforming the steep requirements for cross-registering and truly recalibrating all school calendars. He says that it makes sense to have law-related programs to prepare young entrepreneurs at the Law School, and other resources should be distributed throughout the University for students to take advantage of.
“It should be easier to take advantage of opportunities elsewhere,” Back says. “The University has actively discouraged, and has been a huge impediment, of entrepreneurial activity not just at the law school, but across the University.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years ago, Harvard investigators began collecting videos and computer files from the lab of Marc D. Hauser, the popular psychology professor and best-selling author.
But the investigation was kept under wraps by the University until, facing media scrutiny, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith confirmed in August that an internal investigation had found Hauser “solely responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct.”
As speculation abounded on the type of “scientific misconduct”—which Harvard defines as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism—the professor took a leave of absence and retreated to his home on Cape Cod to work on his new book.
Because Hauser received federal funding for his research, the committee in charge of the Harvard investigation turned over its findings to the Office of Research Integrity in accordance with federal policy.
Now, despite a condemning internal investigation, Harvard finds itself in the unfamiliar position of waiting for another body to dictate the future of a professor who was once a prized member of its faculty.
NO COMMENT
Smith has been silent on the details of Hauser’s case since confirming the “eight counts of misconduct.”
But he said at the time that ORI regulations dictated what information could be released.
“Funding agency regulations govern our process during the investigation and our obligations after our investigation is complete,” he wrote in an Aug. 20 letter to the Faculty.
The investigation found fault in three of Hauser’s published articles, leading to the retraction of one and the correction of two others to edit or remove unsupported findings, Smith said. In five other instances, the studies called into question either remained unpublished or were corrected before publication.
Beyond these findings, the University has not commented on the federal investigation or the precise nature of Hauser’s misconduct.
“Our investigative process will not succeed if individuals do not have complete confidence that their identities can be protected,” Smith wrote at the time.
Following calls for greater transparency, Smith said in the letter that he would create a committee to review Harvard’s policies regarding academic misconduct and the level of secrecy surrounding the process. The University’s Office of the Provost has since led the committee.
“The Provost’s office determined that the issues of concern were not unique to the FAS and established a committee to review communications and confidentiality policies related to potential instances of academic misconduct from a University-wide perspective,” wrote FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal in a statement. The committee is expected to make recommendations to the Provost this summer, he said.
‘AN EPISTEMIC BIND’
Nine months after the federal investigation became public, Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64 threw her hands up in frustration.
“It could take seven years,” she said in an interview with The Crimson last week. “It’s really, really a mess.”
An ORI investigation into a case like Hauser’s typically takes weeks to months to reach its conclusions, according to Ann Bradley, a spokeswoman for the ORI. But if Hauser chooses to appeal the body’s findings, the process could drag into years, Bradley said.
While the federal body conducts its own investigation and reviews Harvard’s findings, the Psychology Department has been forced into a waiting game.
Carey said that she has not been made privy to the details of the University’s investigation.
But in February, the Psychology Department—whose jurisdiction extends to Hauser’s courses but not to his research—barred Hauser from teaching and advising in the 2011-2012 academic year.
Carey said that Harvard’s findings of “misconduct” provided sufficient grounds to prohibit Hauser from teaching.
But until more information on the nature of the misconduct is revealed, Carey says the department will refrain from making a long-term decision.
“Since we’re in an epistemic bind, we feel that we can’t make a permanent [decision],” Carey said. “The reason we only did it for one year is that we’re waiting for the ORI to make its findings public.”
Following the department vote, Smith barred Hauser from teaching across FAS in the coming academic year.
Yet Hauser remains a tenured faculty member in FAS, and it is unclear what role he will play on campus next year.
A tenured faculty member has never faced dismissal proceedings from FAS for research misconduct, but according to the American Association of University Professors, misrepresentation, falsification, and ethical or policy violations are legitimate reasons for termination of tenure.
REPLICATING THE RESULTS
In the midst of public speculation, Hauser has remained largely silent. In a statement made last August, Hauser admitted to making “some significant mistakes,” But he refrained from commenting on whether he committed scientific misconduct and has declined to discuss the ongoing investigation.
And in a statement published in conjunction with the retraction, Hauser took responsibility for an “error,” but did not speak to the possibility of the University’s more severe charge of “misconduct.”
He declined to comment for this article.
But in the three years between the start of the investigation and the official announcement of the University’s findings, Hauser made preliminary efforts to clear his name.
In 2008, aware that he was under investigation, Hauser traveled with two of his research collaborators to Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico to replicate two of the studies called into question.
Two years later in July 2010, a biological research journal called The Proceedings of the Royal Society B published one of the replications, which confirmed the original findings of the 2007 corrected study, “Rhesus monkeys correctly read the goal-relevant gestures of a human agent.”
Then, in April 2011, the journal Science published a replication that Hauser performed in 2008 of the other corrected study called into question by the investigation. Again, Hauser confirmed the findings of his original study.
Scientists in the field have debated how far these replications go in vindicating Hauser.
In an editorial posted on the science blog RealClearScience last Tuesday, Pierre Pica, a linguist and Research Fellow at the National Center of Scientific Research in Paris, said the replications of Hauser’s studies “call into question the accusations of fabrication and falsification.”
Others have called the replications irrelevant to Hauser’s case, both because they were conducted by Hauser himself and because they do not prove an absence of misconduct in the original study.
“Ultimately it’s not a question of whether he can replicate his findings—it’s whether other people can,” said Gordon G. Gallup Jr., a psychology professor at University at Albany, State University of New York who has publicly questioned Hauser’s body of research.
“They need to be independently replicated by other competent scientists in the field.”
A ‘PREMATURE’ DISCUSSION
Carey said commenting on Hauser’s situation at the present juncture is unproductive.
“Each of us has heard rumors, and each of us has our own opinions about what Hauser probably did or did not do,” Carey said. “But those opinions are really worth nothing. The due process goes through the Committee on Professional Conduct and ORI.”
Members of the Psychology Department have not commented on their colleague, seconding Carey’s belief that speculation is useless until the federal investigation releases its findings.
“First, I have no knowledge of the facts of this case to contribute to the discussion,” wrote psychology professor Elizabeth S. Spelke in an email to The Crimson. “Second, the investigation of Professor Hauser is ongoing, making any responses to your questions premature.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four journalists who work in media ranging from newspapers and magazines to radio and television have been chosen for the 2011-2012 class of Nieman Fellows, the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard announced on Tuesday.
The 74th class of Nieman Fellows, according to Nieman Foundation Curator Robert H. Giles, consists of “journalists who have reported from around the globe on an extraordinarily wide range of topics and, in many cases, under dangerous circumstances.”
Established in 1938, the Nieman Foundation for Journalism administers the oldest mid-career fellowship program for journalists in the world. More than 1,300 journalists of accomplishment from 91 countries and territories have received Nieman Fellowships and benefited from a year of study and exploration at Harvard University.
“This is a class of vigorous, talented young journalists who have a keen eye on changing the nature of journalism and who aspire to use their Harvard experience to achieve our level of excellence and contribute to the changing dynamics of journalism,” Giles said in an interview.
The new class of U.S. Nieman Fellows, according to a press release for the Foundation, includes Jonathan Blakley, a foreign desk producer for NPR who will study history, politics, and social media in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Megan O’Grady, a literary critic for Vogue. She will examine the relationship among female novelists, literary criticism, and the canon that focuses on postwar American literature and the persistence of gender myths in cultural discourse.
The international Nieman Fellows include Samiha Shafy, a science reporter for German newspaper Der Spiegel who will be the first Fellow originally from Switzerland, and Wu Nan, a Beijing-based reporter.
Shafy will study how public policy and economic principles shape the way scientific evidence is translated into action to address global challenges, while Nan will focus on how new media is empowering people and businesses, changing political dynamics, and sparking social change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A multi-step analysis process was used by the University in the search for the stolen electronics from 2010.
The process was outlined in the Harvard University Police Department’s incident reports for the investigation of Stephen Evans—a Securitas supervisor who was arraigned on April 7 for allegedly stealing a laptop and an electronic tablet,
When devices are registered with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, each unique device is assigned its own Media Access Control (MAC) address.
The MAC address works similarly to a serial number in identifying the specific electronic device.
The first several characters of the MAC address are specific to the manufacturer of the electronic.
In the incident regarding the Kirkland thefts of a MacBook Pro laptop and an iPad tablet, both MAC addresses identified Apple as the product manufacturer.
The last few characters are specific to the network interface devices—in this case, Harvard University’s Network.
The University maintains logs of  traffic on its network by MAC address, according to the incident report.
Each Harvard affiliate who wishes to connect to the Harvard network must register his or her Harvard University ID with either FAS or the University Information Systems and associate the ID with the device that is being connected.
The Network maintains the registration information for each unique device in order to require the registration only once per device.
Each Harvard organization that acts as an Internet Service Provider is given a limited number of Internet Protocol addresses to assign to devices logging into Harvard’s Network.
The University maintains a log of both MAC addresses and IP addresses. In the investigation of the electronics stolen from Kirkland House, several different IP addresses were mapped back to the same MAC address—that of the stolen laptop—which meant that the stolen computer logged into the Harvard Network from several locations.
A security specialist with FAS-IT is able to establish alerts for specific MAC addresses and did so with the MAC address associated with the stolen devices.
Later, the analysts were able to conclude that the majority of traffic from the IP address associated with the stolen MAC address were coming from two wireless access points—Wigglesworth E-21B and Wigglesworth D-11B, which are on either side of the Wigglesworth gate.
The Securitas guard station is located between those access points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May 2009, Brittany J. Smith was two weeks away from graduating from the world’s most prestigious university.
Raised in Harlem in New York City, Smith had overcome a tough upbringing by making her way into an application-only public school, graduating in the top of her class with a slew of leadership positions under her belt, and gaining acceptance to Harvard.
Yet just as she stood poised to receive her Harvard diploma, Smith’s hard-won gains suddenly came crashing down.
In the basement of a Harvard dormitory, a young man was shot and killed during an attempted drug robbery—and Smith rapidly found herself dismissed from Harvard, under interrogation for her boyfriend’s involvement in the murder, and then under arrest herself.
That fatal shooting which shattered the springtime serenity of Kirkland House inflamed discussion about drugs, safety, and race at Harvard, but two years later, the fervor on campus has largely died down. Yet for Smith and many others whose lives were touched by the violent incident, the tragic saga is far from over.
In the wake of her boyfriend Jabrai Jordan Copney’s sentencing to life in prison without parole, Smith, 24, is next on the court docket.
The two targets of prosecution were just young lovers two years ago. Their relationship, sustained despite stormy conflicts, catapulted them both to the moment at which Copney participated in a murder at Harvard and Smith was forced out of the gates.
Smith and her attorney, John T. Osler, did not return requests for comment on this story.
I.
Smith was proud of her Harlem roots, making it clear that she had experienced a tough childhood, according to a Harvard classmate.
He recalled that Smith “played the part of someone who had street sense.”
“She’s funny. She’s got attitude. She’s tough,” he said.
Smith charted a stellar record through the New York school system. She was a standout student at Frederick Douglass Academy, a public preparatory school in Harlem, from which she graduated in 2005.
At the academically intense school—where classes meet six days a week and college counselors push students toward higher education—Smith immersed herself in the “most rigorous academic curriculum,” according to Principal Gregory M. Hodge.
“Brittany Smith had a wonderful education here,” Hodge said. “A model student at the school—she was a very, very good candidate for an Ivy League [college].”
Smith held leadership positions on the student council, Hodge said, and volunteered much of her time outside of class. She tutored younger students preparing for the SAT, served as a big sister in a mentoring program, and coordinated canned food drives.
Her service to her Harlem community did not stop after graduation. After her freshman year at Harvard, Hodge said, she collaborated with three high school classmates to establish a scholarship fund to help defray the costs of travel and textbooks for female seniors at Frederick Douglass headed to college.
Smith had made her way from Harlem to Harvard—and had found a way to bring the benefits of her new home back with her.
Smith’s Harvard classmate recalled that she often commented on the distinction between fellow black students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Smith would speak disdainfully of those from ritzier parts of New York City and would complain that Harvard students were insensitive to the struggles of blacks and ignorant of the realities of life in poverty.
“It’s difficult to take someone that is into the street life and come to a college campus,” Hodge said.
He said that although Smith received a “phenomenal” education at Frederick Douglass and had even greater academic opportunities at Harvard, “for some reason or somehow, the young lady made poor decisions.”
II.
Ill at ease with several aspects of campus culture, Smith found in Copney, 22, someone with whom she shared a hometown. Copney, an aspiring songwriter, was also from Harlem. Beginning in 2008 the two forged an intense, at times rocky relationship that would contribute to their mutual downfall.
“We’re either like at a really good point or a really bad point,” Smith said in court in March 2011, when she affirmed that she and Copney were still dating. “We had disagreements about, yes, a lot of things.”
The classmate recalled noticing, “It seemed like going back and forth, complaining about him and other times in love with him.”
Friends of Smith note that she may have had cause to complain. Chanequa N. Campbell—one of Smith’s best friends and the other student who was not allowed to graduate from Harvard in the shooting’s aftermath—agreed with the prosecution’s description of Copney as “jealous” and “controlling” of Smith.
“They had a pretty tumultuous but passionate relationship. They were committed to each other,” Campbell said.
That commitment ran deep. Smith said that the two were “basically planning a future together.” By her senior year, they lived together in her Lowell single, said Cambridge Police Detective John W. Crowley in court.
But the relationship was still fraught with conflict.
According to Smith’s testimony in a hearing, Copney at one point ordered her to get rid of evidence, such as framed photographs and stuffed animals, of a relationship that ended about two years before she began dating Copney. She told Copney that she had thrown away the items. But in fact, she had stowed them under her blockmate’s bed—a spot she would later reuse as a hiding place when Copney asked her to conceal the murder weapon.
So when Copney found more relics of the old relationship, he was furious.
One day while Smith was at work at Harvard Student Agencies, Copney came across online chat conversations between Smith and her ex-boyfriend and uncovered an envelope with photographs of the former couple.
“You’re still keeping shit from me,” he said angrily as they walked to Tommy’s Value, the Mt. Auburn St. convenience store, Smith recalled in court testimony.
Copney left for New York the following morning.
About a month after the fight, Copney and Smith decided to start dating again. Copney moved back to Harvard, and about six weeks later, he invited his friends to join him there to conduct a robbery.
III.
Much of the prelude to the Kirkland shooting unfolded in Smith’s Lowell House dorm room.
There, Copney and his friend Blayn Jiggetts attended a party during Harvard-Yale weekend where they met a Yale drug dealer whom they would later allegedly rob at gunpoint of three pounds of marijuana.
There, Copney brought Jiggetts and Jason F. Aquino on May 18, 2009, planning to commit a duplicate robbery in Cambridge.
And there, Jiggetts loaded a semiautomatic pistol—the weapon that would kill a man before the day was out.
Posing as Harvard students, Copney and Aquino went to meet Justin Cosby, a 21-year-old Cambridge drug dealer whom Copney had met with the day before and arranged to buy a large quantity of marijuana. They urged Cosby to follow them to Kirkland’s J-entryway to conduct the deal.
In the entryway basement, Jiggetts pulled a gun on Cosby, and the three New York men told the drug dealer to hand over his wares. When Cosby refused and tried to run from the entryway, one of the men—Copney, according to Aquino, Jiggetts, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts—took the gun and fired three shots.
One bullet struck Cosby in the abdomen, and, by the next morning, he was dead.
While Cosby staggered down Dunster Street bleeding and asking for water, the three men returned to Smith’s room in Lowell.
Then Copney handed the gun to Smith. She took the weapon, rushed two entryways over to her blockmate’s room, and hid the firearm under her blockmate’s bed. Then she called a taxi to serve as their getaway car, taking them to South Station where they boarded a bus to New York.
Smith accompanied the men on that trip but returned to Cambridge the next day, where she first met with police.
Afterward, with Copney in jail, Smith moved in for a time with Copney’s mother, though as of March, then out on bail herself, she was living on her own and working in a New York retail store.
Since his arrest, Copney and Smith appear to have carried on their relationship, and prosecutors have used continued contact between the two as evidence that Smith has motivation to lie to protect Copney. Prosecutors have entered into the record jail visits and phone calls in which Smith has expressed her desire to marry Copney.
At a March hearing that centered around whether Smith’s lies to investigators were cause to bring her to trial, lead prosecutor Daniel J. Bennett ’85 to ask, “Miss Smith, you’d do anything to help Jabrai Jordan Copney, wouldn’t you?”
“Not at my own expense,” Smith responded. “Or at the expense of the truth. No, I wouldn’t do anything to protect him. I tried to do everything to protect him, it failed and now—now we’re here.”
IV.
“Here,” to be precise, is the Middlesex County Superior Court in Woburn, Mass. where Smith may soon stand trial for six criminal counts that include possession of a firearm and accessory after the fact to murder.
Smith had signed a non-prosecution agreement in exchange for her cooperation in the case. But prosecutors said she violated the deal by making numerous untrue and misleading statements, including her claim that she did not see the gun loaded before the incident and her failure to disclose information about the prior robbery of the Yale students.
Announcing that the deal was off because Smith had not upheld her end of the bargain, the Commonwealth indicted her in March 2010. Smith’s attorney responded by asserting that the agreement still stands and that Smith cannot legally be charged.
A Superior Court judge has had under advisement for months the question of whether Smith can indeed be tried. As of now, the judge is set to rule on the matter by June 10.
But at the conclusion of the most recent court action in the case—the sentencing of Aquino, who along with Jiggetts pleaded guilty to manslaughter in Cosby’s killing—District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. ’85 issued a statement indicating that she will be tried.
“Our efforts continue as we turn our attention to ... the trial of Brittany Smith,” he said.
Ruminating on Smith’s turbulent trajectory, Hodge said that Smith’s time at Harvard “should have resulted in a different outcome.”
“I think sometimes the challenge for young people is that ... they can’t bring people or mix up two different worlds,” Hodge said, referring to Smith’s decision to bring Copney from New York to Harvard with her.
Reflecting on his erstwhile star student, Hodge was regretful.
“We’re very disappointed at the sort of situation that this student got herself into.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Harvard security guards were identified in February as suspects in an investigation of stolen electronics, according to incident reports filed by the Harvard University Police Department.
Arthur Miller and Hieu “Huey” A. Pham are both employees of Securitas, the company contracted by Harvard to provide campus security. Both have been identified as suspects.
Stephen Evans, a Securitas supervisor, was arraigned on April 7 for one count of larceny for allegedly stealing a MacBook Pro laptop valued at $2,000 and an Apple iPad valued at $500. A non-guilty plea was entered for Evans at the Cambridge District Court.
Card reader logs from B entryway of Kirkland House identified Miller as one of three non-residents of the entryway who swiped into the hall during the hours that a laptop and electronic tablet were stolen from an undergraduate’s room. The other two individuals were Evans and a HUPD officer, who was dispatched to unlock a student’s room.
Miller sought defense counsel late March when he was approached by HUPD officers during an investigation of the stolen laptop and iPad from Kirkland House.
Pham agreed to an interview when he was approached by HUPD officers on March 4. Evans had named Pham in a previous interview, alleging that he had borrowed $200 in cash from Pham in order to purchase a MacBook Pro from a man in Harvard Square for $400. Evans later admitted in the interview to stealing the laptop.
In his interview, Pham admitted to taking an external hard drive from the Carpenter Center. HUPD Officer Thomas Karns, who conducted the interview, was previously informed that another HUPD officer had reviewed video where two guards entered a locked room in the basement of the Carpenter Center during the time frame of a theft of a portable hard drive on March 22, 2010.
During his March 2011 interview, Pham produced from his bag a hard drive. Pham alleged that he had found this particular one scratched up near the recycling center near the loading dock at the Carpenter Center. Karns reported that he asked Pham to find the scratches on the hard drive, but Pham could not find any, according to the incident report.
Karns also asked Pham why he would go on tours with Evans to areas of campus that were not assigned to him, to which Pham replied that he was merely following orders.
Pham said that guards would bring him their computers for him to fix, as he was known to be tech-savvy. Several guards would ask him to update their software for them, and as a result, Pham claimed that he had registered “probably over a hundred” computers with his Harvard University login.
Additionally, Pham said that his Harvard ID card had stopped working about six months ago, from the time of the interview, and he had been borrowing his colleagues’ ID cards in order to complete his work, according to the incident report. Pham also alleged that he had used his wallet to put out a candle flame, which caused damage to his ID card and caused the card to malfunction.
The investigation continues for Evans, Miller, and Pham.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College graduation brings up many existential questions, not the least of which is: What have I learned in the past four years? This year’s seniors offer very different answers to this question: I’ve learned to value dinner with my friends in the House dining hall; I’ve learned not to procrastinate in writing a term paper; I’ve learned that coffee can be found for under $1.50 in the Square. Yet anecdotes aside, is there a fundamental attitude that marks the 1,600 men and women of the Class of 2011? Hopefully, the answer is yes. The College, as an institution that draws many of the brightest and ambitious young people America and the world have to offer, should have a responsibility to direct these future leaders to a certain end.
Today, it is not sufficiently clear what this end is. It is obviously not what it was in 1650, to educate aspiring Puritan ministers in “knowledge and godliness.” And yet, stating that Harvard College is only a liberal arts institution seems to be denying the reality that undergraduates are surrounded and influenced by powerful professional schools and that the Harvard brand makes them a professional target in a way that students at other schools are not. Understanding this, the College seems overdue for a revitalization of purpose. This issue can be divided into two parts. The first part is the purpose of a Harvard education for the individual student, which centers on the question of the degree to which the College succeeds in providing a traditional liberal arts education. The second is the purpose of this education for society, which concerns how the College should influence the career and life choices of its students.
Traditionally, the purpose of Harvard has been to provide students with the critical thinking skills to succeed at any task they wish to pursue. According to the Task Force on General Education, a “Harvard education is a liberal education—that is, an education conducted in a spirit of free inquiry undertaken without concern for topical relevance or vocational utility. This kind of learning is not only one of the enrichments of existence; it is one of the achievements of civilization.” This mission contrasts with that of peer institutions, such as the University of Pennsylvania, or, indeed, of most colleges around the world, which seek to educate students in a narrow practical specialty.
While the College does a good job of articulating this purpose, it could do a better job executing it; pre-professionalism is present within the student body to an unprecedented degree. There are historical grounds for this shift in focus—the average Harvard graduate is no longer guaranteed a nice job in a family firm regardless of the content of their coursework—and it makes sense that the College has been caught off-guard by what is essentially a side effect of a more meritocratic admissions process. In the largest concentration, economics, this year’s junior seminars—although recently reinstated—were not at all popular among concentrators. In fact, there were only 34 applicants for 68 junior seminar spots in the spring shopping period. The fact that spring is prime recruiting season for finance and consulting jobs surely played a large part in this. Pre-professional extracurricular activities of all stripes are playing a larger and larger role in students’ lives. A student who is attending meetings four nights a week, planning a 300-person conference, or biking to the Medical School to assist in a lab every day cannot possibly devote a full measure of effort to course obligations. Additionally, pre-professional summer internships are gaining more importance and weight. Many students spend nearly half the school year deciding on and organizing a summer activity.
Thus, while extracurricular and summer activities can enrich the individual student’s experience, the time and energy devoted to them threatens to trivialize the actual academic education.
Additionally, the Harvard education does have a social purpose. This truth manifests itself most obviously in the rhetoric of the admissions process, which aspires to become a mechanism of social justice in itself. By the numbers, few schools do as much to empower the middle and working classes. Harvard has embarked on an ambitious financial aid initiative that has brought scholarship to portions of the population that only decades ago were nearly shut out of higher education. Harvard’s broad financial aid program, which strives to prevent students from graduating indebted, has combated the recent hyperinflation of college fees that has mired many young students in debt and forced others away from college completely.
In this light, it seems odd that the College remains officially apathetic with regard to what students should do post-graduation. The question of whether Harvard student should aim for careers in public service should not be contentious. Not everyone needs to run a refugee camp in the poorest country possible; “serving” is more about attitude than about title. Whether as a banker or as a barista, giving back to society should be a normal part of what undergraduates aspire to do. Far from being remiss or overreaching, it would show moral conviction for top-level administrators to dictate this more strongly. President Faust has taken important steps to in this direction: In October 2009, the University held a “Public Service Week,” and the President’s office created a prestigious public service fellowship program this year. Nevertheless, changing the tone of campus discourse to reflect more strongly our societal obligations will take much more than this.
How should the College better articulate and implement the “purpose” of Harvard education? A good start would be to establish a mission statement. We submit the headings on either side of the Dexter Gate, which is already casually cited by many: “Enter to grow in knowledge. Exit to serve better thy country and thy kind.” Right now these are just words on a gate, alongside the 1876 Gate’s quotation from “The Ballad of the Bouillabaisse.” However, the Dexter Gate’s phrase has the potential to be a University staple in the same way that “Princeton in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations” is for Princeton University, where the motto is offered as a prompt for admission essays.
In the end, four years at Harvard should yield more than a diploma; it should establish an individual ethos that enriches the human spirit and betters society. The University’s 375th anniversary is coming up during the 2011-2012 year, and what better way to honor our history than to reinterpret “knowledge and godliness” in a way that has relevance and resonance for today’s undergraduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On December 2, 1968, the editorial board of The Harvard Crimson urged the University faculty to abolish the Reserve Officer Training Corps on the nation’s oldest campus.
By virtue of accepting the institution of the military, our editorial board argued, Harvard was essentially legitimizing the idea that universities and the military should work hand in hand, a notion that in those days The Crimson was simply unwilling to accept. Suspicious of “the over-expansion of the American military machine,” the board concluded that “ending ROTC at Harvard will help to create the critical independent spirit which should be the only ideology of a university.” And although that stance seems to have characterized Harvard’s attitude to the military for the next four decades, opinions on the subject—even at The Crimson—were never unanimous.
On that same day, for instance, The Crimson also published a dissenting opinion by a minority of the editorial board, which rejected the premise that the University should brush aside the institution of the military altogether. “To justify a permanent exclusion of the army and navy from Harvard,” they argued, “one must characterize them as inherently and irrevocably evil, as somehow beyond the pale of civilized society.” In their eyes, this view was as naïve as it was impractical. More than 40 years after what ultimately became the University’s decision to ban ROTC—in a time when the infamously discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” legislation has been successfully repealed—we share the sentiment of this minority.
As President Obama said of ROTC in his Jan. 26 State of the Union address: “It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one nation.” We could not agree more. Now that the military no longer excludes openly gay individuals from military service, we are delighted that President Drew G. Faust has followed through on her promise and welcomed ROTC back on campus. Just as our colleagues wrote over 40 years ago in their minority opinion, the military is an institution that has much to contribute to a university community and vice versa.
This past November, Faust made the case for ROTC’s return at the Institute of Politics, conditioned upon the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: “I want to be the president of Harvard who sees the end of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’” she said, “because I want to be able to take the steps to ensure that any and every Harvard student is able to make the honorable and admirable choice to commit him or herself to the nation’s defense.”
Although many were skeptical of whether the University would take any action following the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” Faust remained true to her word, and her promise became a reality on March 4, 2011. Although the faculty was not entirely pleased with the president’s decision, we admire that she made it. Absent its prior objectionable compulsory and discriminatory policies, ROTC deserves recognition as a legitimate pre-professional track at Harvard. The University supports pre-law, pre-med and pre-business activities on the part of its students; it should also support pre-military study.
Most importantly, however, there can be no better context for an ROTC education than within Harvard’s curriculum and values. It is here that the complexities of moral philosophy, modern politics, and military instruction can be put into dialogue in the grand humanistic tradition of America’s greatest university. Students and teachers of all disciplines and political persuasions challenge and edify each other, and we are confident that the fruits of their considered conversations will redound to the benefit of our nation.
Those things aside, however, there is still a group of Americans that the military excludes from service, which complicates any defense of ROTC’s return to Harvard.
Even though the repeal of DADT will permit openly gay citizens to serve in the military, transgender and intersex individuals are still prohibited from service. In that sense, then, it might seem hypocritical to urge the University to support the ROTC students, especially when Harvard has a non-discrimination policy, which states that any form of discrimination “based on race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, national or ethnic origin, political beliefs, veteran status, or disability unrelated to course requirements” is inconsistent with its principles. Given these facts, some may wonder how the return of ROTC can ever be justified.
Essentially, we believe that the military’s current discriminatory policies are deplorable and should be abandoned. Stories of individuals like Jack K., a third-year student at Harvard Law School who cannot return to the military because of his trans identity, are disheartening and cause for concern. There is no conceivable reason for the United States to deny certain citizens the right to serve their country, especially when countries such as Spain, Norway, and New Zealand have already passed legislation that welcomes transgender people into the armed forces. For the sake and conscience of all Americans, the United States military must be made to do the same. To that end, we also believe that the most effective way to eradicate discrimination within the military is through the involvement of progressive and powerful institutions such as Harvard.
This, in a sense, is the argument for a closer relationship between the military and the academy, something our colleagues in 1968 were unwilling to accept: Only through engagement with the academy and academic discourse can the military ever be reformed. Indeed, that America’s preeminent universities have turned their backs on the military for so long may be part of the reason their progressive values are nowhere to be found within its ranks. In order to see those values translated into realities, the answer is not to continue spurning the military but to embrace it and to seize an active role in recreating it.
In the spirit of the Edmund Burke, who famously wrote that no one “makes a greater mistake than he who does nothing because he could only do a little,” Harvard should recognize ROTC in the attempt to reform from within a system with a major institutional flaw. We would all benefit from a more tolerant military, and, in true Burkean fashion, recognizing ROTC—rather than rejecting it—seems the most promising route to accomplishing that necessary goal at this point in time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students have finally come to terms with the perennial issue presented by the lack of social space on campus this year. New initiatives have developed on campus and tangible changes are being made, offering solutions to the problems of social disunity within the student body. In early fall, a student group with goals to make Harvard’s social scene safer and more inclusive met to discuss the social role of final clubs and to urge them to be more accessible for all, a significant departure from their current role as exclusive organizations with heavy barriers to entry. The initiative was the first to open the door to greater dialogue on the issue of social space and was a worthwhile endeavor because it reiterated the necessity of having social options other than final clubs for students. It set the tone for further soul-searching on the part of individual students to think of alternatives, given available resources. It is heartening to know that the student body is starting to take the initiative to improve its social experience. The number of social options exist that are slowly but surely increasing, and many of them promise to help build a more cohesive community.
Among the most ostensible concerns of Harvard’s current social scene is that the all-male final clubs—which dominate the social life for many a Harvard student—discriminate against women and that even though more women have joined social organizations of their own, their doing so automatically feeds into and perpetuates established gender divisions. In the 2010-2011 school year, for example, the largest number of female freshmen in University history rushed sororities. But rather than fostering a sense of community among those who rush, for many, membership in a sorority serves as a gateway into the final clubs. The clubs’ independence from the University enables them to flout Harvard rules, making them ever more attractive for students to spend their weekend evenings. The social dependence on the final clubs and the idea that one needs a certain ticket to entry—such as membership in a sorority or other organization whose better intentions include female empowerment—needs to change in order to create a more inclusive and integrated social scene.
Our most effective weapon to combat this dependence is one that is already a part of our arsenal: a push toward greater House solidarity. Harvard’s 12 residential Houses stand not only as arbitrary student groupings but as academic and social communities. Beginning in 2012 with the renovation of Old Quincy House, there seems to be a lot in store to capitalize on the potential for tight-knit House life. Drawing inspiration from Yale’s 12-year renewal of its residential colleges, Harvard will look to emphasize an atmosphere that is conducive to social cohesion in its own House renewal, which looks set to remain the top priority for the University’s multi-billion dollar capital campaign. In particular, the architectural changes Quincy House will face are emblematic of a trend that will carry much weight for students. Entryways will be made horizontal rather than vertical “to increase student circulation,” and new multi-purpose rooms will be added in order to address the student need for social space. We laud the University’s efforts in this vein, as this kind of renovation is a necessary step in ridding students of a reliance on organizations outside of its purview for social satisfaction, and in shifting their focus inward toward a House community that can cater to their needs.
We hope that students can recognize these University’s efforts toward developing House life and can thus capitalize on the opportunity to form a closer and better-integrated community. The Houses, after all, provide spaces that are inclusive to everyone and that bar none; they welcome all students with open arms and do not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, or sexual orientation. Students would do well to recognize that the inherent inclusiveness and diversity that Houses provide has immense potential for vibrant and successful social communities. In keeping with this, student cooperation is necessary in order to bring the University’s efforts to fruition. For example, although College alcohol policy is presently in a state of flux, defying alcohol-related regulations would be a waste of an asset like the House community. College rules such as these are enforced in the best interest of student safety, and to disregard them would ultimately hurt students and the safe environment that Harvard is trying to foster.
At the same time, we ask that the College administration bear in mind the fact that a needlessly strict enforcement of its alcohol policy can push students back toward the gender-segregated quagmire that is the current social scene outside of the Houses. At final clubs or other off-campus organizations that lie outside of the scope of University regulations, students have free reign to use or abuse alcohol as they please, as they are in places that are not subject to the restrictions that Harvard goes to lengths to enforce.  As much as Harvard strives to provide space that is inclusive and safe for all, an unnecessarily inflexible adherence to its stringent rules on alcohol consumption will only drive students to spaces where they will be able to flout the rules without facing any ramifications. Furthermore, such strict enforcement will dampen House spirit and take away from the goal of building a stronger community. Instead, the University ought to understand the limits of regulation and, while ensuring safety, should not be so imposing as to force students to search for unsafe alternatives.
Students themselves are beginning to institute social change on campus, and we applaud their efforts to do so. For example, in May students in Cabot House created a social space for all known as Cabot Café, an enormously successful endeavor that proved that initiatives like these are just what the College needs. A coffee shop located in a previously unused common space, Cabot Café provides a safe, friendly, and open environment that all can enjoy, and it cultivates a sense of unity that is inspirational and gratifying. With student- and College-driven enterprises like these, we are optimistic for the future of Harvard’s social space and House life. A little innovation can go a long way, and it seems that we are seeing the winds of change with every effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With our nation’s first college arrived its first college town.  And like any other college town, Harvard Square has grown to become an integral part of Harvard College.
While Harvard as an institution may not frequently change its façade, the Square is a physical representation of the historical continuity that defines this community. Harvard Square, like its eternal partner, Harvard, has been a haven for the offbeat, the creative, and the intellectual. Throughout the years, Harvard Square and the University, entwined in a symbiotic relationship, have evolved with one another, reflecting the cultural developments of both the nation and the University. Harvard Square, with its quirks and its staples, also reflects, perhaps greater than any other metric, the seismic shifts in the desires and needs of Harvard’s evolving student body.
Alumni returning for this year’s Commencement will be sorry to learn that Bob Slate—Harvard Square’s long-lasting stationery store—closed its doors for the final time in March after 78 years of service to the Harvard community. The regional panini chain, Panera Bread, will soon fill Bob Slate’s location. Meanwhile, further down the street, a duplex Starbucks and a Pinkberry, of Los Angeles frozen yogurt lore, opened to a generally mixed reaction among Harvard’s student body. Although some elements of the Harvard community lamented the collapse of local businesses and the concurrent loss of their irreplaceable spirit, it is, after all, this same demographic and their buying power that ultimately decides the success of certain Square businesses. Despite the common misperception, there is no “master puppeteer” running Harvard Square, and many of the property owners, including Harvard, do their best to ensure that the Square remains unique. If anything, the consumers are responsible for these changes, which reflect a changed Square customer more than they do a changed epoch.
Many Harvard students—perhaps too eager to find immediate crises—falsely interpret the Square’s recent changes as a brand new phenomenon. According to the Harvard Square Business Association, which has tracked data on Square business over the past decade, the percentage of independent businesses in the Square during that time has remained between 72 and 80 percent. Much of the supposed growth of national chains is based primarily on perception. As HSBA Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said in an interview: “[Nationals] are in very prime locations… because of their footprint they have a large presence.” Lately, however, the overall presence of nationals has been steady. Quite simply, national chains are more capable of paying the rent and filling the large spaces of Harvard Square’s most prominent commercial real estate. Even if Harvard students can be criticized for perceiving recent trends in the Square’s changes of the last year, one can fairly assume that the rise in rent over the last several decades would push out some older, independent businesses from the Square’s prominent locations.
Every community balances the need for change with the aspiration to hold onto the spirit of its traditions. Of course, this balance exists in multiple realms, yet it appears most overtly in the prosperity (or demise) of local, independent businesses at the hands of less unique and more corporatized national chains. Although some changes in Harvard Square over the past decades may be representative of the changing costs of supporting a business here, others are more easily attributed to changes in consumer culture both within the world and at Harvard, specifically.
As is evident from a glance of Mo Lotman’s “Harvard Square: An Illustrated History Since 1950,” the rise of the so-called “coffee culture,” the shift of the legal drinking age from 18 to 21, and the emergence of Internet shopping are only some of the national and international consumer trends evident in the evolution of Harvard Square in recent years.  According to data gathered by the HSBA, there has been a noted shift in Harvard Square from retail establishments to restaurants. Whereas 50 years ago a glance down Massachusetts Avenue would have revealed barbershops, tailors, and diners, a look today would show a few independent stores, newer eateries, and towering banks. Certain business niches are—in an age of subsidized chain stores—replaceable, and the ones that can compete are becoming smaller and more specialized.
Some of Harvard Square’s changes are the inevitable results of the constantly expanding economic and cultural backgrounds of Harvard’s student population. Today’s average student is probably more likely to prioritize price when shopping in the Square. Additionally, Harvard’s variety of businesses, both in terms of price scale and specialties, will continue to evolve with the demographics of Harvard’s student body. The closing of Bob Slate, for example, is a sign of a Harvard Square better tailored to students’ needs instead of the desires of the tourists and past students who knew a Harvard none of us will ever know. As Harvard Square responds to the University’s evolving student body and market trends, it will find a new balance that must cater to functionality and multiculturalism.
Unfortunately, the closing of some of Harvard Square’s oldest independent stores seems inevitable. Yet, insofar as Harvard and other property owners are capable of preserving the spirit of the Square, we trust that they will stem any possible trends toward gentrification and corporatization.
At the end of the day, we, the consumers, determine the fate of our local stores and, in turn, the face of Harvard Square. The rent or space may encourage national chains—and we should not view that development in a wholly cynical light—but, by and large, we are the greatest determinants of the prosperity of local stores.
Harvard and its students benefit in ineffable ways from the individuality and soul of Harvard Square’s independent businesses. We would do well to remember that these stores rely, not on our vocal support, but on our buying power. In short, Harvard Square will only maintain its uniqueness as long as Harvard students provide their half in this unequivocally symbiotic relationship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard dramatically put off its planned giant construction project in Allston two years ago, many on campus and beyond wondered whether all of the hype and extraordinary circumstances would ever amount to anything. The past academic year has offered a partial answer to this question. Officially, Harvard’s administration remains committed to its second campus at Allston. The challenge facing the Harvard Allston Work Team, the body advising President Faust on Allston, has been compounded by the widespread perception that Harvard has treated Allston’s community poorly in the process.
In an effort to demonstrate that the 2008-2009 financial crisis has not irrevocably shut down one of the University’s most ambitious projects in some time, Harvard’s bigwigs have been forced to devote attention to a neighborhood in some places ravaged by aggressive acquisition tactics and large-scale, unfinished foundation work. Announcements such as the one by Harvard Business School earlier this spring of a planned Innovation Lab suggest that action to build at Allston will continue at a gradual level. While the Harvard Education Portal has already started to function and served the local community well, Allston’s signature, one billion dollar proposed Science Complex has yet to be started.
At this point, two developments look set to influence considerably the future of Allston. One should be the upcoming report from the Allston Work team on the future of Allston. Rather than just reporting its findings to the President’s office, the Work team—led by former Institute of Politics director Bill Purcell—should do what important administration communiqués and diktats often fail to do, and release its recommendation to the general public. In a case that involves such a large portion of a neighboring community—not to mention the broader network of Harvard’s students and faculty—Purcell and his team would do well to leave this sensitive issue open to suggestions and input.
To be fair, increasing attention does seem to be focused on how to placate Allston’s community. For instance, Harvard’s recent announcement of a seasonal ice-skating rink near the giant hole by Allston’s Western Avenue—left by initial and abandoned work on the Science Complex—indicates little else. In this case, Harvard stands the best chance of reaching an amicable and effective resolution with its neighbors in Allston by actively involving them in the kinds of projects they would like to see implemented. If Harvard’s physical presence in Alston is to be about dialogue and synergy between local residents and the University’s community, it makes sense to begin this relationship at the earliest possible point.
In the long-term, of course, Innovation Labs, skating rinks, and an Education Portal (i.e., a kindergarten) will unlikely meet the demands of either disgruntled Allston residents or Harvard’s own network of students, professors, and alumni. Despite the secretive nature of Harvard’s piecemeal acquisition of large chunks of Allston’s property over the past two decades, planners initially impressed all parties involved with the lavish conception of a second campus in the area. It is difficult to see how Harvard will ever walk away from Allston with its head held high without fulfilling in some large part this initial goal of constructing a major academic facility. Until then, property in Allston will likely remain un-built, and major lots empty or underdeveloped. So Harvard stands a good chance of rebuilding its relations with Allston by embarking on the initial goal of transforming the area into a major academic hub. The Allston Work Team should primarily view Allston not merely as a clean-up job but also as a major opportunity.
Here, the issue of money comes into play, and a second, important development becomes relevant to the discussion—namely,  the upcoming capital campaign. This plan, due to kick off officially a couple years from now, aims to raise a record amount of money to supplement Harvard’s endowment and fund major initiatives.
Earlier this year, this newspaper expressed its support for putting Allston at the fore of this landmark fundraising initiative, even above pressing House renewal plans. Given Harvard’s record of what has so far proved disruptive involvement in Allston—and its notable failure to carry out its much-vaunted construction—the Development Office will have to devote significant attention in marketing effectively the continuing challenge of this development. Although alumni and donors may react jadedly by this point to the sound of the Allston project, it is important not to prioritize reaching a record-breaking sum by publicizing the most attractive message over securing the funds necessary for our most important projects. For this reason, by this point, Allston’s regeneration ought to constitute a significant part of the capital campaign’s message. With full and transparent explanation, the kind facilitated by the releasing of concrete plans from the Allston Work team, donors can be encouraged to look at the long-term benefits of extending Harvard’s physical space and putting neighborhood relationships on a better footing for the future.
In the spirit of commitment to tough endeavors, Harvard can still emerge successful in Allston by completing the major project it has started. This, of course, remains the stance of Harvard’s administration, including President Faust. For this stance to be translated into realized action, however, more concrete plans need to be set out for what exactly Harvard plans to build in the space it owns in Allston. Merely thinking that we can sweep the issue under the carpet by giving a few sops to the community is not the best long-term approach. Indeed, the only way this venture will be a success for Harvard and for Allston will be for the University to fulfill its initial plans of building a major, “second” campus on the site, billion-dollar science complex and all. A flourishing academic center will do volumes for the community and the University’s own continuing problem of good, usable space. As we look forward to the capital campaign, this should be the focus of raising the vast amount of money still needed for the project.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in 2006, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi had a PR problem. Having acquired a decades-old reputation as a sponsor of terrorism and an oppressor of his own people, Gaddafi wanted the West to see him in a more positive light.
So he turned to a Cambridge-based consulting firm called Monitor Group, a company co-founded by Harvard Business School professors and closely affiliated with prominent faculty members. They were an effective bunch.
They flew Western intellectuals out to Libya who then returned home to wax poetic in the American media about Libya’s political reforms.
They compiled a report, which affirmed that Libya was the world’s “only functioning example of direct democracy on a national level.”
But today, as a civil war rages in Libya, those experts who coordinated the project and who participated face an image problem of their own.
As the world has turned its attention to the upheaval in the troubled North African nation, the academic community is scrutinizing the activity of several professors who worked with Gaddafi’s regime—and, in one case, helped with his son’s dissertation—as consultants or guests of Monitor Group.
In the wake of the revelations, some Harvard faculty members are encouraging the University to publicly find fault with at least one of its most prominent professors.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 is foremost among those calling for Harvard to respond to the work of University Professor Michael E. Porter, a Monitor co-founder and a co-author of the report that called Gaddafi’s Libya a “popular” democracy, an analysis from a top academic that recent history shows was greatly flawed.
CONSULTING FOR A DICTATOR
When Libya contracted Monitor, the firm produced a 79-page slideshow mostly analyzing Libya’s economy.
But Harvard professors have focused on the political conclusions of the report, which, among a set of recommendations, indicated that Libya was a functioning democracy and heralded the country’s system of local political gatherings as “a meaningful forum for Libyan citizens to participate directly in law-making.”
The report was a product of Monitor’s work consulting for Gaddafi from 2006 to 2008. The Libyan government—headed by Gaddafi, who has ruled since a 1969 military coup—hired consultants from Monitor Group to provide policy recommendations, economic advice, and several other services.
The consulting group carries a distinct Harvard flavor. On its website, the company touts the Harvard ties of several of its founders and current leaders.
Of the 16 “thought leaders” who head the company, six mention positions at Harvard—mostly at the Business School—in their biographies on the company website.
Lewis has focused the discussion on Porter, who has come under the most intent critical gaze among the professors involved due to his high positions in both the company and the University. At Harvard, he holds the University’s most prestigious faculty position as a University Professor, a cadre that includes Paul E. Farmer, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Lawrence H. Summers.
In response to recent criticism, Monitor has pointed out that when the firm was working in Libya, the political climate was markedly different from the current atmosphere of violent internal conflict.
Beginning in 2003, Gaddafi began pursuing better relations with the West, announcing that Libya would no longer seek nuclear weapons and that it would pay compensation to the families of victims of the 1988 plane bombings over Lockerbie, Scotland, which the Libyan government was accused of orchestrating.
In 2006, when Monitor began working with Gaddafi, “the policy of the United States and the U.K. and other countries was beginning to embrace bringing Libya back into the community of nations—you had a country that was in the dark for a long time that looked like it was coming into the light,” said Larry Kamer, a spokesperson specializing in crisis management recently brought on by Monitor.
“What has transpired since has made it very clear that Gaddafi was just not ready for reform,” he added.
Porter said in a written statement to The Crimson, responding to Lewis’ criticism, that he ended his work with the regime when the situation began to change.
“As it became clear over the following year that vested interests and conservatives had succeeded in halting the reform process, I stopped my work in Libya in the first quarter of 2007 and have not worked there since,” he wrote. Porter declined to comment for this article.
Today, top Libyan diplomats say the report’s conclusions portrayed a distorted vision of Libya.
The offices of Libya’s Mission to the United Nations declared independence from Gaddafi’s regime in February as the civil war escalated. “All this optimism, it was all based on empty promises,” Second Secretary of the Mission Dia A. A. Alhutmany said in an interview with The Crimson.
Alhutmany said that Gaddafi’s “real face” has now become apparent. As heated conflict rages between Gaddafi’s forces and the rebel ranks, the Western world is now largely united in its criticism of the regime.
‘AFOUL’ OF THE LAW
The episode crossed from dubious judgement to a question of legality when the U.S. Department of Justice, prompted by media scrutiny of Monitor’s activities in Libya, expressed concern that the firm may have been acting as an unregistered foreign agent—in effect, lobbying for Gaddafi.
Monitor then launched an internal investigation, which found that the firm had in fact “run afoul of certain laws,” according to Kamer.
The company said that its program of flying scholars to Libya constituted lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In early May, Monitor retroactively registered the program in Libya, as well as recent work for the Kingdom of Jordan.
The program brought one visitor to Libya each month to improve the image of Libya in the Western world. According to a 2006 memo, Monitor was paid $250,000 per month for one year, plus an expense budget of up to $2.5 million.
These visitors, the memo promised, would be prominent American thinkers who would be selected based on two criteria.
The first: the relevance of their ideas to the Libyan authorities whom they would meet.
The second: “the strength of their influence in guiding US foreign policy.”
The list of visitors forms an all-star lineup of academics from Harvard and other top institutions, including Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert D. Putnam—an expert on democracy theory—and former Harvard Kennedy School Dean Joseph S. Nye.
Putnam has since said that he was unaware of the program’s intention to influence public opinion and that he would not have participated had he known.
The memo, co-authored by Monitor’s director and its CEO, former Harvard Business School Professor Mark B. Fuller, was leaked in 2009,
It said that “Libya has suffered from a deficit of positive public relations and adequate contact with a wide range of opinion-leaders and contemporary thinkers.”
It continued, “This program aims to redress the balance in Libya’s favor.”
The memo further stated that Monitor would encourage the publication of articles favorable to Libya in some of America’s most reputable newspapers and magazines, and that the company would work with Libya’s lobbyists to identify influential Americans—writers, professors, politicians, and others—who “need to be approached ... to enhance their understanding and appreciation of Libya.”
Kamer also said the consultants wrote a book proposal for a never-realized work in which Gaddafi would voice his political views. In addition, they did research for Gaddafi’s son to use in his doctoral thesis at the London School of Economics.
“It’s a real aberration from the work they do,” the spokesperson said. “They don’t help with dissertations.... Ghostwriting books is far from the Monitor Group’s core mission.”
SCOLDER-IN-CHIEF?
While Monitor has said its visiting scholars program was in violation of U.S. law, Lewis has focused on the consultants’ report. He first vocalized the debate at Harvard on the floor of the April Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting.
“A tyrant wanted a crimson-tinged report that he was running a democracy, and for a price, a Harvard expert obliged in spite of abundant evidence to the contrary,” he said in April.
Lewis urged University President Drew G. Faust to take a position on the episode.
“Harvard rightly expresses its pride when a member of our community does something noble,” he said. “Shouldn’t Harvard acknowledge its embarrassment, and might you remind us that when we parlay our status as Harvard professors for personal profit, we can hurt both the University and all of its members?”
Faust has declined to call Porter’s behavior inappropriate, saying that the president’s responsibilities do not include serving as “scolder-in-chief.”
“I was disappointed by her response,” Lewis said in a recent interview with The Crimson.
Faust maintained in a later interview that Monitor is a separate entity from Harvard.
“That’s an independent organization and business, commenting on its own past behavior, and I would weigh in somehow?” she questioned in an interview with The Crimson. “I don’t think it’s the president’s role ... in the great marketplace of ideas, I’m responsible for keeping it open, keeping it lively, encouraging participation.”
While Faust declined to comment on Monitor’s actions, others have been more critical.
“Monitor has publicly stated that it erred, and far be it from me to disagree,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman said. “They participated in what turned out to be a public relations effort.”
Harvard Law School Professor Detlev F. Vagts ’48 said the professors’ actions with Monitor hurt the University’s reputation.
“It’s lending the Harvard name, in a sense, to Gaddafi,” he said.
Chibli Mallat, a visiting professor at the Law School, said he has had dealings with the Gaddafi regime under very different circumstances.
He is currently representing the family of a Lebanese imam who disappeared in 1978 and may have been killed or imprisoned by Gaddafi, He said he has been offered money by the Libyan regime to drop the case.
“I’ve been very blunt about rejecting it,” Mallat said. “In a way, I feel a little bit of more than satisfaction that I did what I think, that I refused to be—.”
Mallat cut off his sentence. He continued, “I don’t have a judgment of colleagues, but I know that I had a choice like this and I didn’t take it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David sat quietly under the pong table in Mark’s common room, his arms wrapped around crossed legs. Rules stipulate that if a player on the losing team does not make a single cup, they become a “troll,” trapped under the table for the entirety of the next game. David had not made a single cup. Fortunately his partner had sunk a few cups, or he would have been running a naked lap around Winthrop House. The room’s beer-soaked wood floors pulsed under the throaty rhymes of Ja Rule. It was a Thursday night during final exams, and the boys of Fifteen Minutes—mostly former editors with a few current editors, collectively known as the FM bros—had gathered one final time before graduation.
When two guys discovered foils in the corner of the room and began fencing, I glanced at my watch. It was nearing midnight: clearly time to wrap up this shindig. The night didn’t show much promise. There was senior bar, which the young ones weren’t too enthused about. There were other bars in the Square, which the young ones weren’t too enthused about. And that was really about it.
“Why don’t we just go back to Tufts?” I joked. Everyone laughed.
A couple had been to Tufts before. It wasn’t the most successful trip. We had a limited number of contacts up at Davis Square and weren’t even sure if the school was still in session. But the beer supply in Winthrop was running low, the fencing match had grown hostile, and Ja Rule only has so many memorable hits.
“Seriously, there’s not much else going on,” I said. “Let’s go.”
Reactions were mixed. Some made excuses: exams the next morning, impatient lovers waiting in bed. But others gulped rum shots and prepared road sodas, excited for their return to Medford. Ultimately, four of us—Mark, Alex, Charleton, and I—committed to the trip. Certain that the T had already closed for the night, we hailed a cab on Dunster Street.
“To Tufts,” we told the driver.
He dropped us off somewhere in the middle of campus, no one was quite sure where. We asked a few kids passing by on skateboards if anything was going on that night, but they didn’t want to share. Dance music emanated from a brick house down the road, and we walked toward it. The kids smoking outside wouldn’t let us in, until we identified a mutual friend. It was a frat, with overstuffed leather couches, framed portraits of members on the wall, three enormous pong tables, and a glossy mounted flat screen. Not a terribly foreign environment. We claimed a spot on one of the tables and started to mingle. We drank Natty Light and slapped the bag. We searched the top floor of the frat for more Natty Light and ran out of the building when a brother found us.
Soon enough, we found ourselves in the fourth-floor lounge of a freshman dorm. Some students yelled at us to be quiet, it was after 2 a.m. One freshman invited us to his room to chat. We told him we went to Babson, and, without explanation, he gave us his political philosophy texts. He told us the night was likely over at Tufts, and we should probably head out. We hunted down a cab, Hobbes’ “Leviathan” and Mill’s “Utilitarianism” in hand, and asked the driver to take us to Church Street, to the Market.
The night at Tufts didn’t reassure me of Harvard’s social superiority, or make me lament not going to a fun school. It reminded me that at college, any college, we do a lot of stupid things. They’re generally harmless, but usually very stupid. Cutting your face on the rhododendron you’re urinating on. Stealing whiskey at a party. Hiding from Tufts RAs in a closet. Breaking and entering. Waking up in the Advocate the next morning. Writing and publishing this piece. In college, we get away with these things, things that may not be tolerated in the real world. But in college, these nights become stories, legends. Even parents can laugh at weekend tales. Boys will be boys, they say. Well guys, I don’t think we’re boys anymore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three small things happened this year that stood out to me. The first was a Facebook post from a friend who wrote, referring to graduation, “You’re almost a real person!” The second was an ad in the Crimson for a graduate school that warned, “the real world sucks,” and the third was an Office of Career Services pamphlet that called applying for fellowships a way to “venture into the real world.” You don’t have to look very far to find someone ready to tell you how life at Harvard is somehow unreal, but this construction of reality surrounding Harvard is a fundamentally inadequate perspective.
The main reasons people, often students, view the College in this way, is because of its stark difference from the life we have known before, and the life we expect to know after. This difference however should not serve as the line of real and fake, but rather show us the plasticity of our existences. It is true that, in all likelihood, at no other part of our lives will we live in a one-mile radius of all of our closest friends, or spend each day expanding our knowledge, but these differences should encourage us to always choose to live how we want, rather than by what we are expected to once we enter the “real” world.
Harvard, in this way, is the most real part of our lives we may ever lead, because while here we have been freed from the from the errands and details that otherwise disturb us. We do not have to shop for groceries, pay electric bills, or commute to work each morning. Instead, Harvard grants us a period of time to do exactly what we really want. When else can you spend January working with children in Uganda, June through August researching at the World Bank, September hiking the Appalachian trail with seven strangers, and October through November questioning William James’ theory of personality, Sharia law’s effects on international policy, and even the value of green fluorescent protein.? Harvard’s reality opens us up to opportunities that were before only fantasy, and lets us live them. Perhaps former Harvard President Nathan Pusey said it best, that Harvard “was not so much an exercise in learning as an experience of life itself.”
Considering these years as less real than our time outside of Harvard also diminishes what we have done here. Every academic insight, every connection made to the past, to the future, and in between disciplines, was importantly authentic. The same is true of our own creations while at Harvard. The beauty of a documentary film, or an improv scene, or a mathematical proof is as real as the effort we have put into them. Our athletics are a prime example of this. Ask any athlete on the reality of their 6 a.m. practice in the rain, or a jump shot against Princeton, or the climb up heartbreak hill, and you will see that all of these things are crucially real to the people that did them. And indeed, of our entire Harvard experience, nothing has been more real than our relationships. From pre-frosh weekend to senior week every smile, every meal together, and every walk along the Charles has been as tangible as any friendships we may form. Proof of this exists in the testimony of any alumni, who will tell you that their roommates, classmates, and teammates have remained close friends, no matter where life has taken them.
Harvard is unique. It is memorable. Everything about these four years disrupts our transition to and from the rest of life, not because of their falseness, but instead their enduring reality. For now, our Harvard experience is coming to a close, but rather than lamenting our entry into the “real world,” let us hold as tightly as we can to the reality we have created here, and replicate it far outside these gates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Massachusetts chose to relinquish its unequivocally liberal reputation by sending a man with a pickup truck to the U.S. Senate, Cambridge—for its part—did not follow suit.  A mere 15 percent of Cantabridgians cast their ballots for Scott Brown. And yet, after four years of maintaining my right-of-center views at Harvard, I am convinced that there is no better place to be a Republican.
No, really.
For the minority of students who arrive at Harvard with self-professed right-of-center views in tow, this institution offers something that is dolled out much more sparingly to their progressive-minded counterparts: a thorough and frequent challenge to their political views.
While for some this translates into a full-scale conversion of political belief (Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, was once a member of the Harvard Republican Club), for most it is an exercise in toning the muscles of political argument, and more importantly, finding the oft-ignored weaknesses.  In short, the Harvard Republican learns why he believes what he believes; and the Harvard Republican learns where to break rank with orthodoxy.
Consider a friend of mine.  Leaving her freshman dorm on a Tuesday evening in September, her roommate stopped to ask where she was going.  “A meeting,” my friend, the freshman, replied tersely.  The roommate pressed.  “A Republican Club meeting,” she relented.  The response: “Oh. Well, it’s okay. I don’t judge.”
“College,” Robert Frost once remarked, “is a refuge from hasty judgment.” Perhaps.  But it seems “I don’t judge” is precisely the phrase one uses to conceal one’s hasty judgment. The Harvard Republican is often the victim of the hasty judgment of his cohorts—and understandably so.  National Republicans have done one thing well in recent years: tarnishing the brand.  So there exist plenty of reasons to raise an eyebrow at a classmate who labels herself Republican; at least two of those reasons have their own cable shows.
The political views that one holds upon arriving on campus are, at least to some degree, a product of the prevailing demographic of one’s home territory—or, at least, the influence of one’s family or their news channel of choice.  For those arriving at Harvard as Democrats or as liberals, the environment is undeniably more hospitable than those for whom “Ronald Reagan” is pronounced only with the requisite amount of reverence.
Leaning to the left at Harvard rarely receives a meaningful challenge.  A Democrat rarely has to follow a declaration of his political affiliation with the corollary, “But let me explain.”  In the midst of a campus where students default to Democrat, being Republican, though, is a conscious choice that must be made and re-made throughout the undergraduate experience.
Ross G. Douthat ’02, a former Crimson contributor and a current New York Times columnist, lamented in a 2005 Atlantic pseudo-exposé entitled “The Truth About Harvard,” that “Harvard was easy” and plagued by rapidly declining standards.  The problem, he concluded, was that “no one was pushing back.”  Whether true or not of Harvard academics, for the Harvard Republican, someone is always “pushing back.” And that makes for the sort of rigorous thought that Douthat declared absent in the classroom.
Thus, as the Harvard Republican approaches graduation, he understands why he holds his right-of-center beliefs.  Not only has he justified them multiple times to peers “pushing back” across a dining hall table, he has justified them to himself when forced to self-evaluate.  That is to say, his political beliefs now inform his party affiliation, when for others party affiliation far too often informs political beliefs.
That self-evaluation, though, can produce less-than-orthodox views.  Imagine the reaction of then-New Hampshire GOP Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte when, at last year’s Republican Club Lincoln Day Dinner, one of the club’s board members explained his vision for a type of government-run health care system.  (It did not stop her, thankfully, from critiquing the Obama health plan in her subsequent speech.)
This is not to say that a Harvard Republican is simply a Democrat with an identity crisis.  No, the Harvard Republican knows that he does not have to subscribe to the entire party platform to be a Republican; and he certainly does not have to stand for the nonsense that too many soundbite motivated conservatives spew.  He knows that he can support the best of the party’s policies, while offering a full-throated critique of the worst.  And if freshman roommates kept that in mind, they might be less hasty to judge—or declare their aversion to judging, as it were.
David Brooks, the Times’ other resident center-right columnist, explored in an August 2010 piece the “metacognition deficit” in politics that produces policy stances determined not by circumstance but by reluctance to deviate from “tribal purity.”  He writes, “Very few in public life habitually step back and think about the weakness in their own thinking and what they should do to compensate.” Only a “few people I interview do this regularly,” he notes. Maybe he should interview a Harvard Republican; they do it all the time.
Looking ahead, I have little doubt that Harvard will break decisively for Obama in the 2012 election. Yet I envy those Republican students who will be here for the election season. For while I may be generalizing a bit too easily or may have grown excessively nostalgic, I say it again: there is no better place to be a Republican.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the student president of the Institute of Politics, people ask lots of questions when they hear I’m working for Google in D.C. this summer. Why, they ask, am I not working in a Congressional office, policy think tank, or nonprofit? President Kennedy’s famous call to service takes on a different meaning fifty years later in a world where we have a computer in our pocket, our music in the “cloud”, and hundreds of Facebook “friends” online. Technology is making it easier than ever to collaborate and work with each other to solve problems and is creating new ways for us to serve.
For what may be the first time in American history, our generation has the capacity to teach our parents something new. When I was in high school, I developed a PowerPoint lesson and taught teachers how to better implement the tool in classrooms. Similarly, I am sure almost everyone receiving a diploma this year helped a professor, parent, or grandparent learn something about their computer, phone, or iPad. On a larger scale, young people are tackling the toughest problems around the globe with technology. Google, a company whose CEO is only 38 years old, has invested over $100 million towards Google.org, a nonprofit that uses Google’s brainpower to help build tools that have (among other things) helped speed disaster relief efforts in Japan and helped the Center for Disease Control track outbreaks of the flu. Just two hours after the earthquake in Haiti, a small team at the U.S. State Department built a text message-based donation tool that raised over $27 million. This project is one of many led by Alec Ross who became the Secretary of State’s “Advisor on Innovation” at the relatively young age of 37. Other projects he leads include a text messaging systems that warn women and children in Congo of attacking rebels and coordinating “Tech Camps” around the world that use American talent to help international communities build vibrant social networks, websites, and blogs. I am sure that if you could peer into the offices directing these projects, you will probably find a team of young recent college graduates.
Our better understanding of technology combined with a practical skill set gives us more ways to solve problems for our communities. Each Fall semester, an increasing number of undergraduates take CS50, the Introduction to Computer Science course, designed to give novice programmers the skills to build a final project. Of the 400 students enrolled this year, many choose to develop final projects designed to correct some problem on campus, whether it is designing a website for a student organization or creating a new room reservation system for students. Students find something wrong in our community, and they fix it.
Not everyone who comes to Harvard is destined to impact the world in the same way. We have diverse talents and interests; not all of us can connect with people like John F. Kennedy ‘40 or have the entrepreneurial spirit and creativity to develop an entirely new organization like Alan Khazei ‘83.  Additionally, finding an entry level position in a traditional “public service” job isn’t easy. When was the last time someone from the Department of Agriculture invited you to Starbucks to discuss “joining the team?” How easy is it to find a public service job when the Office of Career Services categorizes only 60 jobs as public service-related among the 4000 in their database?
Although finding a job that fits the traditional description of “public service” may be hard, the fact is that service is more than a career: It’s a way of life.  Politicians may be better dressed, but like computer scientists, they are problem solvers. The CS50 students who made a text-messaging tool to educate school districts on under-served classrooms deserve the same level of respect as your elected school board member working to balance the budget and find better salaries for teachers.
Since 1890, Harvard students, professors, and visitors will have read the advice of President Charles Eliot over Dexter Gate: “Enter to grow in wisdom; Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” Most of us would not be at Harvard were it not for our commitment to service and regardless of our careers, our experiences here should make us better at it! I came to Harvard interested in both technology and politics and now I couldn’t be more excited to spend the summer working to engineer products that will help Americans learn about and vote during the 2012 elections.  As we leave Harvard, our capacity to learn doesn’t end; the debates over tax policy from dining halls continue on Google-Chat and our friendships with professors and teaching fellows will be maintained over Facebook and email.  Thanks to the times, the spirit of our education here, the culture of solving problems no matter how intellectual or realistic or trivial or global in scale, has the capacity to make an impact like never before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My roommates and I should have loved our big-windowed, river-view common room when we moved in sophomore year. Unfortunately, there was a major complication: noisy neighbors. Not only were they loud, but they were also, well… weird. We decided this based on the ruckus filtering through a firedoor that might as well have been cheesecloth for all the sound it kept out—a combination of shouted conversations, television soundtracks, unidentifiable scraping, and operatic arias (sung live, early in the morning). Through expert Harvard and Zuckerberg facebook stalking, we learned that the guys who shared our wall were seniors. Once, they left on a weekend night intending to “find some girls,” and returned half an hour later with no evidence of a female among them. We found that telling, and snickered about it for weeks.
I wrote an opinion piece for this newspaper soon after, pointing out how students judge disembodied voices on the other side of the firedoor without bothering to get to know the actual speakers. I had an explanation for the common habit: “What you hear when no one knows you’re listening is often as real as it gets,” and so the people you meet through the walls are more authentic than the people you’d meet if you shook their hands face-to-face. In other words, Type A Harvard undergraduates are so committed to appearing perfect that the only way to find out the truth about us is through intentional or unintentional eavesdropping.
As I was prone to do, I offered readers advice that was really directed at myself: “Instead of latching on to moments of vulnerability, realize that the urge to tear down comes from our own insecurities.” I felt guilty about poking fun at boys who I had the privilege of hearing uncensored, especially because I was afraid of what people thought who caught me during similar moments. At that time, I was determined to hide my embarrassing quirks, my insecurities, and my temper from even close friends. It seemed necessary to appear flawless—I thought that only immediate family would accept imperfections without turning tail and sprinting in the other direction.
Around Thanksgiving, I noticed that the firedoor was no longer flush with the wall. It had somehow inched out past its frame, enough that I could grab hold and pull. It opened. My roommate and I found ourselves facing two half-strangers. We stood there, shocked and staring, until they invited us in. It was like entering Narnia through the back of the wardrobe, we said at the time. Finally, we had met our “firemates.”
After I pried it open the first time, our firedoor rarely stayed closed. When my roommate cut her hand alone in our suite, a firemate ran over and rushed her to University Health Services. If any of us needed fashion advice before a party, we would throw on various outfits and parade next door to get a trusted man’s opinion. A few roommates and firemates made a habit of trudging across the river to the rink in chilly early-morning darkness to ice skate before class. Together, we mourned the death of Phoenix Firebird, a much-loved fish, at a maudlin memorial ceremony on Weeks footbridge (complete with an operatic aria, sung live). Nights would often end on the firemates’ futon, sometimes with a bottle of port, where we debriefed before heading to bed. As it turned out, the four boys were fantastic. Eccentric, yes—but also funny, generous, inspired, and warm.
As pseudo-roommates, the firemates witnessed our unglamorous moments—the very struggles, irritations, and mistakes I had planned to keep secret. And they did not run away. In fact, a roommate and firemate started dating a month before graduation. It did not matter that he already knew how she looked without makeup, covered in sweat, or wearing unflattering outfits that he vetoed as her fashion consultant. It did not matter that she had seen him right after a week-long computer coding session, during which he stayed up all night and subsisted on snacks from the Science Center vending machines. They both fell in love with real people, human beings who sometimes have greasy hair and do not manage their time well. He moved away that summer, as expected, and we assumed they would break up. Two years later, my roommate and firemate are still one of the most mature, functional couples I know—largely because, in my opinion, they began being honest with each other long before their first kiss.
I was wrong when I wrote that the only way to discover the vulnerable side of a Harvard student is through anonymity. Like it or not, you can live with someone only so long before cracks start to form in the public facade. I was also wrong to believe that these pockets of vulnerability drive others away. It is the people we are able to ask for help, the ones we sometimes tell to shut up, the few we are willing to completely break down in front of—get red and snotty and plain disgusting—that actually last. Sometimes you pick them, and sometimes they just show up next door, in the last place you would think to look.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little over three years ago, members of the class of 1967 sent an open letter to President Faust accusing current Harvard undergraduates of apathy and political indifference. They subsequently asked for a task force on the issue, proving once again that the pot can in fact call the kettle black. So we’re not exactly chaining ourselves to John Harvard in protest of the array of rainbow colored lawn chairs nearby. We’re not practicing sit-ins for the return of hot breakfast and party funds, though a combination of the two would be phenomenal—shots of Bacon Bacardi, right? Regardless of our lack of overt activism, we still find ourselves very much attuned to current events in a very dissimilar way than our fellow alums.
Much of this technological revolution is unfairly associated with vapid time-wasting. I mean, there is that, but these changing technologies specifically have also directly improved our college years here at Harvard. For one, picture the second floor Lamont student, anxiously fast-forwarding lecture videos to speeds where booming professors’ voices are now chipmunk serenades—in fact, Rebecca Black maybe ought to take a note out of this Lamonster’s playbook. We no longer have to navigate the canals of Widener and Lamont for our research—Google Books provides them in a single click, and you need not worry whether or not they are soaked in urine.
So we have new ways to study or find the best classes and cheapest things: “So what?” you may say, “That’s been essential to every college experience, not just ours.” Yes, I concede, we may have found new ways to do it, but workload fatigue and stinginess have always been regular elements of college life. Well then, how have things truly changed for just us? Well, for one, we have found an outlet for the non-existent dating scene here. You can post a missed connection on ISawYouHarvard about that extremely unique girl —she had brown hair and was in Justice lecture! Later you can lament about the aftermath on Harvard FML. More aggressively, you can now “spark” love interests on campus, proving that we can actually degrade ourselves lower than poking to electromagnetic metaphors that make even less sense.
In addition to aiding and abetting Harvard’s awkward dating scene, we have found in new forms of technology a means to strengthen our sense of community. We collaborate on Housing day videos that attempt to change that popular top 40 song about rappers’ models, money, and power, into ones about masters, mascots, and the prettiest bell tower. Certainly, we must not overlook our favorite social media ladies we love to hate—the Harvard Hoochies, who not only represent a promising thesis topic for a Women and Gender Studies concentrator on male hegemony, but also the BU community uniting with that of Harvard, though in ways that I’m too much of a gentleman to speak of.
No, class of 1967, we are not apathetic; in fact, we are very active. We express our opinions, desires, tragedies, and whatever other vapid emotions we feel on these websites and programs. We don’t revolt, we re-tweet. This is a new level of comfort in a different means to interact, one that has latently underpinned our four years at Harvard. Somehow, it’s okay to poke someone instead of asking her to grab coffee; it’s okay to BBM friends about events, instead of mailing paper invites; it’s okay for you to be “invisible” but still continuing conversations, transcending time and space. New avenues of interaction have changed Harvard for us in ways to which our alumni and other generations truthfully cannot relate.
While it’s not to say this interaction is good or bad, it is simply different. Insomuch as we may be able to better maintain friendships from afar as post-grads, we are also opening a window deep into our personal life, for which we are unaware who is observing and at what times.
We will adapt to these new technologies and means to interact with little fear; well, unless twin Olympian rowers continually stalk and sue you claiming intellectual property infringement. An isolated incident, of course. As a result of this increased ease of communication, though, we must remain cognizant of our true friendships as well as how they exist outside a series of windows and clicks that can too easily be muted or closed.
Our truly memorable experiences at Harvard, though, are the ones beyond the screen. The excitement of storming Annenberg for housing day, the feeling of triumph over Yale, or the epiphany that the D-List Yardfest artist you had never heard before actually is talented can never be quantified by tweets, sparks, or photo tags. Yes, maybe one day we will be the spiteful curmudgeons of the class of 2011, angry that present-day Harvard students have forgotten to share their every emotion, reaction, or check-in with others. The class of 2011 leaves Harvard, a proud contingent of @post email owners, but also real people behind the send button, capable of hugs instead of friend requests, smiles instead of sparks, laughter instead of LOLs, and even tears instead of FMLs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Commencement approaches, my roommate and I have spent a lot of time discussing how Harvard student life has changed since freshman year, from the new Pinkberry and Starbucks welcoming us into the square, to Au Bon Pain becoming more polished, to the increase in our opportunities to travel abroad. What has not changed is the role of extracurricular programs in our lives. At Harvard, we are given the gift of working with and learning from 6,500 other remarkable students and over our past four years extracurricular activities have offered us space in which to take advantage of this opportunity. These social programs remain important, as evidenced by the tens of hours each week we dedicate to unpaid labour beyond our schoolwork, still caught running to meetings even with cap and gown in hand.
The International Relations Council is the umbrella organisation for different groups on campus including Model United Nations conferences and a travelling team, tutoring group, international publication, and more. I spent the past year organising its board of directors and central staff, while trying to find my proper role amidst our three hundred members. My decision to take on the position of president culminated in a near meltdown as I worried about whether I would be able to balance enjoying my senior year, and continuing to be involved in everything possible. I found the necessary perspective with help from the remarkable friends I met through this club. While this position required me to contribute an immense amount of time and energy, the people I could count on to support me were those whose trust and confidence I gained through our time in the organization.
Through time spent in meetings and rehearsals, we have all extended our groups of friends beyond our Houses communities, which can sometimes feel insular. The over 300 student groups on campus offer many different communities to belong to, and students have the flexibility and choice to move between these social groups and professional networks. I built friendships with people with whom I shared interests and time; extracurriculars not only united those of us with common ground, but also allowed us to create shared memories (both enjoyable and painful) to commiserate over.
Additionally, while I know this does not hold true for everyone, extracurriculars can help satisfy a need for practical experience. This does not just mean wearing suits for days on end (although I’ve certainly seen enough western business attire to last the rest of my life). It also means doing work that has a real-life impact. Extracurriculars like Model United Nations or the Crimson may distract us from our daily problem sets and papers; however, they can also prepare us for the real world as skills applicable to the workplace are not easily found in class. Yoseph Ayele ’11 explains: “I've learned many more practical and 'soft skills' as part of the Leadership Institute at Harvard College compared to what I gained from the classroom. What I am taking away from LIHC are the most practical and applicable skills and qualities that influence how well I will be able to function in the world. How to work well with people, how to design work processes, how to influence those around you without formal authority, how to negotiate, how to communicate, how to build organizations, etc—these are some of the hard skills that I learned within the extracurricular sphere that I didn't learn from many of my classes and even professors.”
On Tuesday, President Drew G. Faust addressed the class of 2011 and spoke about the importance of shaping our own life narratives. After four years at Harvard my story certainly includes my interactions with professors, lecturers, and classmates, but at the forefront stands my relationship with the IRC, and other clubs. In the future I want to make a tangible impact on society, and because of my participation in these activities, I feel prepared to tackle certain problems with a sense of professionalism and experience.
Looking forward to our fifth, tenth, or even twentieth reunions, what will we remember about our time at Harvard? For better or for worse, I will not only remember jumping out of my seat to ask a million questions after my first class, but I will also remember living in the Boston Park Plaza for a week during my junior year while helping to run our college Model UN conference, and the hours I spent agonizing over the annual program budgets. Over the past four years, I did not have to choose between our studies and our extracurricular activities very often, but when I did, I was lucky enough to have friends beside me making the same decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a queer freshman, I thought Harvard was paradise. Sure, the Queer Resource Center (QRC) then was in a dim basement staffed entirely by student volunteers. (I didn’t yet know that alumni—not the College—funded the space.) But that was already light years ahead of high school, where there weren’t even pamphlets with the word “gay.” I didn’t notice that proctors didn’t get much training on queer issues. That was because it had never occurred to me that I could talk to authority figures about coming out.
Fortunately for me, I didn’t notice these institutional deficiencies at first because my peers filled the void. But I was lucky to find a solid support network so quickly, made easier because I had already started coming out at age 13. Others may need more institutional support. When Harvard has a new, fully funded director and center of BGLTQ student life in Boylston Hall next year, the College will finally begin to catch up to peer universities like Princeton and Penn in BGLTQ resources. But even in the wake of such institutional progress, we can’t neglect the vital, overriding importance of treating each other well.  Indeed, it was my friends, neighbors, mentors, and instructors who helped me feel comfortable (or uncomfortable) being queer and out in our daily interactions. In fact, in many ways, it was straight allies who made all the difference.
It takes allies to build or ruin a climate of understanding around BGLTQ issues, and subtle actions can often have the greatest impact. When I mentioned to my new freshman entryway-mates that my main extracurricular would be the Queer Students and Allies (QSA), they responded with encouraging smiles, and I felt much less anxious. When I showed up to my sociology class in a luscious wig and fishnet stockings, my professor led an engaging discussion about dressing in drag, and I felt empowered. Conversely, when I heard my whole dining hall table laughed at a series of homophobic jokes, I stared at my bowl of steel-cut oatmeal to avoid looking at their faces, and I felt dejected. As another op-ed attested several weeks ago, it’s still all-too-common to hear words like “faggot” on campus.
There are two major challenges with relying solely on a queer minority and institutional resources to combat homophobia and transphobia. First, we all spend most of our lives outside of queer circles and institutions, meeting people and trying activities from across campus. Second, those who need access to formal institutional resources most are the least likely to seek them out. Questioning students are understandably hesitant to visit the QRC or to join the QSA, because those groups are seen to be for queers only—the “and Allies” part of the QSA is more aspiration than reality. We’re simply not at the point where queer issues are everyone’s business.
So how do we make the well-being and happiness of the entire Harvard community—queer students included—everyone’s business? My roommate offers one example: If you see yourself as a straight ally, ask your friends. She has sought me out numerous times to ask about queer terminology, because she knows how important it is to stay smart on queer issues and terms. (Yes, it is offensive for you to say “tranny”. No, only those who tell me I’m condemned to fire and brimstone refer to my intrinsic sexual orientation as a “lifestyle.”) As a minimum, find out what mental and physical health resources exist so you can guide a friend. I only got help from mental health services because a friend convinced me of how helpful the therapists were.
Don’t let your knowledge and care go unnoticed—make sure people know you’re an ally. Much of my anxiety around being queer is around if, when, and how to share with someone, wondering about the reaction. Speak up against stereotypes and homophobic or transphobic jokes. Ask your queer colleagues at work how you can help as an ally. Grab a safe-space sign or a rainbow pin from the QRC. I met one of my (straight) best friends here prefrosh weekend when we talked about our pins!
Finally, strive to listen and be open. Queer communities don’t come in one color or shape; each student comes to grips with his or her sexuality in a different way, and each person has different concerns, desires, and experiences that make up his or her perspective. It’s a truism that Harvard is a community of people from many cultural, ideological, and socioeconomic backgrounds, but it applies here as well. Not all of us want same-sex marriage. Not all of us even vote Democrat—a gay student has been president of the Republican Club during two of my four years here.
The recent announcement of a new director and center for BGLTQ student life at Harvard was a watershed moment. We have come a long way from a century ago, when the University held an inquisition to expel gay students, and even from 2006, when after nine years of advocacy, the University finally added gender identity to the non-discrimination clause of its Handbook for Students. Many have labored to bring change and build institutional support for queer students and allies. But none of us live in silos. Queer students are athletes, musicians, volunteers, friends, and family.  Like anyone else, respect, warmth, and understanding make all the difference in our lives, here and beyond Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fall of my freshman year, I lived in a fishbowl. This, I realized only after the fact when the halcyon days of early September had passed. To my newly-minted college self, it was simply a second-floor room in Wigglesworth Hall, intended to house one student and his servant, yet somehow stretched to fit four eighteen-year-old girls. Our first afternoon together, struggling to stand amidst four sets of dressers, desks, and duffel bags, we drew straws. I drew the shortest, which entitled me to the suite’s only single: a glorified closet cloistered in the room’s rightmost corner. It was narrow enough to span both walls, fingertips to toes.
My first months of college, this single was my sanctuary. Sure, its size suggested an absurdist farce, staged at the behest of some far-flung administrator. Its location, too, poised over the Yard’s most trafficked entrance, ensured early wake-ups by excited intonations in foreign tongues: The ten yards in front of my entryway was, apparently, a must-see stop on tours of Harvard Yard. Yet, in a world that afforded few opportunities for solitude, these 50-odd square feet were the only on campus where I could be utterly, blissfully alone. Here, without retreating into the hermetic depths of Widener’s stacks, I could be sure that I would see no one—and, more importantly, that no one would see me.
I grew up in a suburb of Boston, which seems, in part, to explain my anxieties. Our neighborhood was the brainchild of a nameless 1970s developer, who took the added initiative of erecting a golf course—weeping willows and artificial ponds included—just down the street. The ostensible purpose of these ever-expanding lots and blocks, I suppose, was to foster a community of white, upper-middle-class, 2.3-children families. Yet, however aesthetically removed from the ticky-tacky sprawl spoofed in Weeds, the effect of private driveways and picket fences was an embargo on human interaction. Walking the subdivided streets gave one the impression of walking on the moon: You always felt like you should go back inside. While one could see the epileptic flickers of television sets through uncurtained windows, rarely did one encounter actual human life. Long after my days of playing in the driveway had ended, the scene began to feel almost post-apocalyptic: An endless inventory of impeccably groomed lawns that nobody ever seemed to sit in.
Freshman fall, then, came as a social immersion like none I had never experienced (except at its oft-analogized counterpart, summer camp). Up until that September, friends and family had always occupied separate spheres. As a day student at a private boarding school, being social required a 10-minute drive. Now, no such divisions stood. Our common room devolved into a motel, its futon perennially occupied by a friend of a friend. My days transpired in an ambient flutter of pre-twenty somethings, all possessed of an inhuman ability to fall asleep at 4 a.m. and wake to the tinny melodies of Memorial Church four hours later. To my freshman self, still uninitiated in the habits of sarcasm, campus life came as a welcome, though wearying, change. With midterms imminent and the novelty of Camp Harvard faded, the Yard’s numerous social taboos (of which dining alone in Annenberg was the most grave) became exhausting, even oppressive—milder versions of the totem terrors ruling Edith Wharton’s New York. On bad days, my room, though perversely sized and thinly walled, offered refuge from the scrutiny of the clan.
An offhand remark to my boyfriend soon shattered the sanctity of this space. As he related the comment from a freshman peer, my cheeks turned a uniform scarlet: “Dude, I saw your girlfriend naked.” Prior to this mortifying disclosure, I had treated my bedroom’s backmost corner as a black box. I couldn’t see out, so nobody could see in.  Exiting our cramped communal shower, I would change in my bedroom, my back pressed against the door. Loathsome speculations now replaced my former certainty. During these post-shower seconds, how many other students had seen me in the buff? In how many tourists’ snapshots did I inadvertently star, sans clothing?
Suffice it to say, my shade was drawn for the rest of that semester. Come January, the privilege imparted by my fortunate straw pull expired. Faced with the prospect of sharing a bunkbed with a comically hostile roommate, I opted for the concrete walls of my boyfriend’s Canaday single. When I returned the following fall, I entered the more casual world of upperclassmen, where everyone “did their own thing” and free lunch was served daily from noon to 2:15 p.m. As for my room, I upgraded from a fishbowl to a first-floor double that my roommate and I dubbed “the aquarium,” only half in jest. Strategic use of blinds and Ikea furnishings made the space oddly comfortable, even when fluorescent ceiling-lamps lit it aglow for all walkers past.
It was now my classmates’ turn to court invisibility, a feat which many accomplished more successfully than I. There were, for example, those friends relegated to the red-brick oblivion of the Radcliffe Quad. Every so often, we would meet in the Yard, exchange polite smiles and tepid small talk, and make amorphous plans for future get-togethers. There was the anonymous assortment of peers with whom I shared fire-doors and walls, and about whom I know more than is comfortable to admit. There were those library patrons whose furtive marginalia I read, the general incoherence of which left me vaguely reassured. If I didn’t understand Deleuze, neither did they.
Far from overexposed, these classmates were never seen. After our collective exodus from the Yard, they enrolled at an alternate, parallel Harvard, comprised of the same buildings and professors, yet never quite intersecting with my own. Three years later, I only wish that they had been a bit more visible, once in a while.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve recently entered into a love affair with the Myers-Briggs personality assessment. Last week, on a roommate trip to Rhode Island, we flew kites, ran in the rain, took the Myers-Briggs assessment via an iPhone, and lazed around reading aloud our results. “Good wholesome activity,” my roommate’s grandpa declared.
In our last moments at Harvard, we take a last stab at understanding the Harvard beacon of diversity in terms of our personalities, marveling at how differently we approach conflict, relationships, and our daily lives. (Hey—at least we’re not analyzing boys.) A roommate scrutinizes a website that suggests that people of my personality type (ENTP for those in-the-know) metaphorically climb mountains just for the sake of climbing mountains and not-so-metaphorically argue just for the sake of argument. She laughs at the veracity of the criticism and dramatically reads from another website that the assessment is a tool to bring our lives “closer to our heart’s desires.”
Myers-Briggs is indeed a delightful tool, especially entertaining in understanding how we might approach our futures. But I wonder about the assumption that we should aim to bring our lives closer to our heart’s desires. I question if most of us really know our heart’s desires. And I am unsure that, even if we can pinpoint these passions of the heart, it’s a noble pursuit to run after them.
Am I foolish? “Express yourself.” “Follow your heart.” “Be yourself.” Our Harvard education deeply impresses these platitudes into our psyche. The phrase, “Know thyself,” attributed to many an ancient Greek scholar, suggests that we find wisdom internally. All of this advice assumes that our hearts are good and our desires are noble. But where does good come from? Is not true nobility the sacrifice of the self, not the realization of the self?
As Harvard students, as Americans, maybe simply as humans invested in our own well-being, we believe that freedom is inherently self-oriented. We trust that we are truly free when we have complete control. But perhaps we are truly free when we have fully surrendered to others, or to God. Perhaps we are truly free when we have lost ourselves.
Lose ourselves? How do we lose ourselves? We are told that our twenties are the time to find ourselves. Our graduating class will push off marriage, and push off commitment, until we achieve some marker of personal success. Nothing is inherently problematic with this state of affairs, but it assumes that we can find ourselves or achieve wisdom through our own efforts. Perhaps the idea of “finding ourselves” enhances selfishness, rather than wisdom.
American individualism centers on personal success, and we often unthinkingly suppose that the purpose of life is the cultivation of our personalities and skills toward the end of our personal well-being. But how does this prepare our psyches to take part in relationships that demand looking beyond the self? How does this prepare us to trump the self in pursuit of the selfless? The mindset of personal fulfillment leads us to believe that pursuing our own emotional needs is the utmost end of a good life.
Is this kind of happiness, built on our own desires and pursuits, a lie? Are we even meant to seek our own happiness? Can we achieve happiness if our supreme goal is to be happy? Is the assumed imperative to fulfill our own needs the best approach to life?
Over my years at Harvard, I’ve been most invested in conversations about happiness and purpose, mainly because I have far more questions than answers. I remember a specific conversation with friends from across political and religious spectrums concluding one Saturday lunch (I’ll miss those taco Saturdays) that we should strive to be happy. But this conclusion is terse, convenient, and leaves little room for intricacy. What do we achieve in this world when we constantly measure our own emotional gain, even in the activities that could be most selfless—service, friendship, love? In the case of happiness, I wonder if the good is the enemy of the best.
As budding Harvard graduates, we are blessed with opportunities for fortune, profit, and relative ease. We have worked hard, we will work hard, and we will likely reap benefits, or “rights,” from that hard work. Yet when our rights to success, rights to happiness, and rights to ease, love, and justice are allowed to guide our lives, we pass over insight.
Perhaps our lifelong challenge, precisely because it runs counter to all of our education, and all of our desires, is to relinquish our rights in order to pursue a greater guidance. Seizing our personal rights is a tool for our own welfare, not an indicator of wisdom. It is a wielding of power, not a stride toward the best life.
And what is the best life? Attempting to answer that would be, say, like trying to climb a mountain for the sake of climbing a mountain. But maybe it is when we reach for the stars that we will likely never grasp. When we find that happiness is pleasant but that the quest for wisdom beyond the self is enchanting. Maybe it is when we relinquish natural control for supernatural surrender. Maybe we’ll never know, but it is a colossal mountain, so let us grab our gear and try.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s somewhat embarrassing to admit that between the years of seven and 17, my whole life had been directed toward getting into Harvard. Every essay, every test, and every homemade diorama depicting Native American domestic life represented one more cliff to be scaled on the great ascent to Harvard College.
I’m probably not the only one who forewent a vibrant social life or non-resume-boosting activities in order to get into Harvard. One memorable Friday night in high school, my mother knocked on the door of my room. I was taking a practice SAT. She gave me $40 and told me, “Sweetie, go see your friends. Here’s money so you can take a cab.”
Now that we’re here, we implore each other to pause and appreciate our lives—and then promptly scamper back to Lamont. And even though we know we can’t be “the best” at Harvard—there are just too many people here who really are the best at whatever it is they do—we often lose sight of ourselves while trying to succeed in school, in service, in sports, in leadership, and even in social life.
Despite everything we’ve been told about college being a life-changing experience, there seems to be little place here for the failures that are part of any true personal transformation.
Luckily, there is one community at Harvard that is entirely devoted to helping students make their lives meaningful—whatever that might mean for them.
That community is Harvard Hillel, an institution whose service reaches far beyond its mission to be “the catalyst for Jewish life on campus.” For me, the Hillel community was an antidote to the competition that had driven me into the ground while I was climbing to the top.
At Hillel, students are considered valuable not because of how talented or hardworking they are, but because they are intrinsically worthy of attention, investment, and love. You don’t need to be anyone other than yourself, flaws and all, in order to fit in at Hillel. In fact, you don’t even need to be Jewish—because while Hillel is driven by Jewish ideals, it embraces people of all ages, ethnicities, and faiths. Anyone can take part in the many classes, religious services, and social activities that take place at Hillel on any given day.
And in a community where three (or more) radically different forms of Judaism are practiced simultaneously, it’s hard to feel like an outsider for long. Students involved in Hillel are used to figuring out how to accommodate a wide range of personal preferences when it comes to religious observance, social life, dining rituals, and educational endeavors. There will always be room for you, and, more importantly, there will always be respect for you.
Hillel’s immense diversity facilitates an environment of personal discovery and growth. I have never seen people change as dramatically and deeply as I have at Hillel. I am perhaps the most glaring example of this kind of transformation.
I didn’t have a traditional Jewish upbringing—no Hebrew school, no bat mitzvah—but when I came to Hillel late my freshman year searching for a spiritual home, I found what I was looking for. I found a resting place.
Resting is a big thing in Judaism: maybe that’s why I never felt I had to “work” at Hillel—not to be “more Jewish” than I was, not to join every committee in the institution, and not to be the smartest or the prettiest or the funniest.
Around people who believed in an existence greater than the one we can see, and in an environment that encouraged discussion and dissent, I began to let go of the cynicism I had developed over so many years of striving to be the best. There was more out there, and there was more within.
Before I became the undergraduate president of Harvard Hillel, I had never held a position of leadership. No other community had made me feel I was worth more than the hours I could work or the goals I could reach. No other community had made me feel truly valuable as a person.
But at Hillel, I looked beyond my grades and my resume and saw something I had never seen before. I saw a risk-taker, a decision maker, a world-changer. I saw a leader.
So Hillel changed me from the inside out, and I got my real college experience after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The days and nights of Senior Week are blending together, a combination of induced haziness and simply a ton of things going on. Every night has been wonderful, hilarious, sloppy, euphoric, or heartbreaking. I would venture that I am not alone in having experienced combinations of the above in different stages of the same evening. It’s terrifying that recollections are already blending together for me, as I can only imagine them growing more distant once we leave this place. Yet such blending also reflects the best thing about Harvard: its ability to smooth all the sharp edges of experience as we fight another day.
The events of Senior Week can serve as a recent example. On the Moonlight Cruise, some people had a great time, while others felt trapped unhappily on a three-hour tour—a three-hour tour! Yet after the higher stakes of a class-wide event, many of us just returned to our friends to keep having fun. That night was my favorite in quite a while—not for the events of the Cruise, but for the memories that followed our return to campus. Again, recollection begins to blend with time—I cannot quantify how many similar nights I have had here, having the more memorable experiences after, not during, the big event on campus. That is no slight against some of the more fun gatherings that dot a student’s calendar—just the acknowledgment that those events are also all similar after a while. It takes a massive collective memory to reminisce or feel synergy on such a greater scale.
If I am guilty of generalization here, or if others have had widely different experiences, I am not presuming that my recognition is universal. What I will miss the most about Harvard, though, is the clan that has formed around me, one that constantly fluctuates but never goes away. On any night in Quincy House, I will have friends doing something together, from building the biggest beer pong pyramids of modern civilization to squabbling with each other over cell phone use during a movie. Someone will make macaroni and cheese. Someone will come in upset. Someone will sleep through the whole day and provide an excuse for reliving it all again. We have all been busy in our own pursuits, but the pattern never broke over my four years of college.
In this collective camaraderie of college, the cliché posters originally intended for British citizens facing the Blitz in World War II are, while still the type of decoration that we will shortly outgrow, quite right in their message: Keep Calm and Carry On.
In college, there is no such thing as a zero-sum game. We bottom out only to find our friends in the dining hall the next day, ready to offer sympathy and support. We peak, only to come down to earth when we open Gmail and have one hundred emails reminding us we still have three balls in the air. Sometimes those moments have sharper emotions—success and failure in our romantic lives, the moment we read our thesis grades—but Harvard keeps moving, and we all continue to ride along with it.
Harvard is a lot of things, but one thing it is not is limiting. I’m not sure if anything really makes Harvard the best university in the world, or if we would feel any differently at another school. I do know that I would come back and do it all over if I could because there’s so much I never had time to do. The greatest temptation our school has offered may be that it makes us, as the wise Bilbo Baggins once described himself, butter spread over too much bread.
Even as the details of Senior Week will end up mixed together, I know that details will stand out, for better or worse. With every memory of strong emotion I’ve felt during the week, I also know that a second memory will follow with it. In those second memories, I’m with my friends, moving forward and putting the first one behind me. Life is too short to relive one moment for very long. Hopefully I have learned, like my university, always to carry on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Commencement comes conclusion. In the quartet of years that constitute Harvard College, what have we learned? With any hope, it has not been an exercise of learning how to sound good nor a plush, academic “lite” sojourn from real life.
The former is characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge universities. In a critique of the “the caste of Britons who attended private school and/or Oxbridge before joining the establishment,” Simon Kuper of the Financial Times depicts a quietly damning portrait of how shallow rhetoric can be the conclusion of a British college experience. To him, most Oxbridge graduates do fine in life because “their entire education had been a lesson in winging it. They knew that all you need to succeed is to speak well, and that’s what the British ruling classes do: they speak well.”
What began in the fall of 2007 and ends now was, for me, an avowed departure from the pitfalls of British university culture and embrace of the liberal arts system espoused by Harvard. Yet there are imperfections in both places. The British version of prestigious higher education—with its earlier specialization and more intimate advising and tutorial functions—can be defended against the vast, sprawling infrastructure of undergraduate studies at Harvard. It also has history on its side: a “600-year head start” in its architecture, libraries, archives, collegiate self-government and more, according to Professor Howard Hotson of Oxford University. He laments the perception that “no other country remotely challenges America’s effortless supremacy,” when it comes to university rankings.
Hotson provides analysis of this inflated notion of the American Ivy League, and by extension, of Harvard’s less magnificent stature. He stipulates that Harvard is “manifestly not the ‘best of the best.’” Defending Britain’s higher education system against privatization efforts by the Conservative government, he warns that they will constitute a shallow consumerist ride: “Market competition in the United States has driven up tuition fees in the private universities, while diverting a hugely wasteful share of these resources from academic priorities to improving the ‘student experience’ and debasing academic credentials through market-driven grade inflation.” Indeed, he equates private universities with a Four Seasons version of student life.
Professor Jonathan R. Cole of Columbia University (and former provost and dean of faculties) adds further doubt to the argument that Ivy League “student experience” is the top of the crop. He attributes it to an attitudinal change: University has turned into a luxury commodity based on the “perverse assumption that students are ‘customers,’ and since, the mantra goes, the customer is always right, what he or she demands must be purchased.” As a result, money has been hemorrhaged on creating a shallow, consumerist version of the university cradle of true academic excellence.
Surely Harvard has been more than merely steeped in a culture governed by money and overrun with commodities? With the finality of graduation, it is essential to grasp why I would—absolutely—do it all again. Despite the pomp and circumstance of this time, the ceremonial frippery of Commencement is an occasion to mark one’s individual testimony of time spent at Harvard.
Harvard has resembled a comfortable ride, certainly. That there is a financial aid program with a high budget of $158 million makes it more comfortable for some who cannot afford the ride. Among the extensive library system, high-profile professors and state-of-the-art labs, I’ve procured tiny flares of truly excellent “experience.” This Commencement, everyone will take away anecdotal evidence of Harvard deeper meaning—perhaps the poetry seminar in which they were told to “be well, be safe and be brave.” You can’t pay for those words with dollars.
Graduation from Harvard marks the finite quality of four years as an undergraduate, but the more ephemeral experiences within the vast, costly one that Hotson and Cole so hotly criticize will prove to be the fiber of the experience. When I sat down to my interview at Oxford, I fared what is painted as academic farce by Kuper: “Even the entrance exam for the British establishment chiefly tests the ability to talk without knowledge. Good grades are not enough. You also need to perform in a peculiarly British ritual: the Oxbridge interview. It works like this: you are 17 years old. You are wearing a new suit. You travel to an Oxbridge college for your interview. You find the tutor’s rooms. Perhaps you’re served sherry, which you’ve never seen before. Then you talk. The tutors, sprawled on settees, drawl questions about whatever is keeping them awake … If you speak well, you get handed your entry ticket to the establishment.”
With my ticket out of Harvard, I (hopefully) learned how to speak well, but I’m leaving as a happy customer as well. Unabashedly a consumer of the “student experience,” I know that the transactions throughout were intellectual, not marketized. With conclusion, Commencement and my poetry professor’s goodwill, I can take my ticket and ride back into real life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear incoming freshmen: As you will soon observe, Harvard students are diverse in their socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, interests, and personalities.  But one thing that much of the Class of 2015 has in common is the experience of being “the smart kid” in school, the “big fish in a small pond.”  You’re probably used to excelling in the classroom and in your outside activities; learning comes naturally to you.
With that in mind, you likely have a hard time imagining what it’s like to be a “small fish in a big pond.” When I was a Harvard-bound high school senior, I certainly did.  At the time, I was used to being the star student at a top public school on Long Island.  Though many of my peers were very bright, I had yet to be surrounded by people who were far more talented and intelligent than me.  And so I saw myself as the smartest person my age that I knew—not because I was arrogant, but because I was ignorant.
I was quickly disabused me of this notion during my first semester at Harvard.  Math 21a acted as a wake-up call, an early realization that the bar had been set higher than before.  Although it seems silly now, I had never really struggled in a class before. I distinctly remember lectures where I felt like the dumbest person in the room, and problem sets for which I didn’t know where to begin.  You will too, especially if you take Ec 1011 or Life Scince 1a.
This unfamiliar feeling carried over to my hobbies and extracurricular activities.  Throughout four years at Harvard, I met people who are more skilled and accomplished than me at everything I enjoy.  I thought that I was a great pianist, before I met actual concert pianists in my class.  I thought that my writing was excellent, before I read the work of my peers on the Crimson and Harvard Political Review.  Even my knowledge of history and political trivia paled in contrast to that of my friends in the Harvard College Democrats.
I guarantee that at some point in the next year, you too will discover that you are not the smartest eighteen-year-old you know.  This realization will be weird and unpleasant at first.  But the humility you will gain from the experience is valuable.  Being challenged in my classes and my extracurriculars caused me to appreciate how much hard work and dedication it takes to truly excel.  This gave me the focus I needed to meet those challenges.  Even better, having friends who are more accomplished and talented than you broadens your mind and offers a tremendous opportunity to learn.  (Your friends will learn from you, too.)
No, you won’t be Phi Beta Kappa, president of The Crimson, captain of heavyweight crew, and the lead in the musical.  Unlike high school, Harvard simply has too many exceptional people for any one person to dominate at everything, or even a few things.  But once learning becomes a real challenge, and you accordingly put in the extra effort necessary to excel, the occasions when you are recognized by your peers will be that much more meaningful. As a junior, I got tremendous satisfaction out of being selected as a Crimson editorial columnist.  But I would never have been able to write high-quality columns if I hadn’t first experienced the frustration of having my work critiqued during the application process to join The Crimson, or hadn’t learned from more talented peers on the Editorial Board.
So where does this leave you, as a not-quite-Harvard freshman?  In the next four years, apart from what you learn in your classes, you’ll realize that you don’t have to be the “best” at everything to feel fulfillment. Real intelligence reflects your ability to learn with eagerness, passion, and perseverance.  The sense of confidence that you get from being able to appreciate the talents of others and feel secure in your own abilities will serve you well in the biggest pond of all—the real world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What House are you in? It’s a standard question that receives a perfunctory, reflexive response from the average Harvard student. “I’m in Lowell,” one person might say. “Currier,” might be another typical reply. Usually these answers require one to three words, with only twelve shades of variation.
Yet I’ve noticed that many of my friends and I tend to stray from those dozen conventional responses when asked that most basic of Harvard queries. “I’m in Leverett, but I basically live in Kirkland,” one of my good friends always says. Another told me that despite his residency in Adams, he listed Kirkland as his desired house in his senior survey.
One of my roommates and I share our usual answer: “Kirkland—sort of. But I essentially live in the Loeb,” she and I tell people. We always joke that although technically we have been assigned rooms in Kirkland House the past three years, we spend a great majority of our time at the Loeb Drama Center working on productions for the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club—and we might as well call the Loeb our home.
As a result, we have both been involved in the Kirkland community only marginally. By no fault of Kirkland’s, I doubt more than three tutors know me by name and I can’t say I truly cared whether or not we won the Straus cup. Kirkland has an undeniably energetic House atmosphere and one that, in retrospect, it might have been nice to engage with more fully, but I nevertheless found the on-campus home I needed elsewhere.
I feel this is a sentiment shared by many students who couldn’t name their HoCo members or have never attended a House opening ceremony. Admittedly, the housing system is one of the things that drew me to Harvard; I loved the idea of this built-in community that stays with you for years to come. However, when I actually got to campus I slowly realized that participation in House life just wasn’t that appealing to me personally.
Instead I immersed myself in the world of Harvard theater. I’ve appreciated and enjoyed living in Kirkland, and on my senior survey I did list the House as my top choice. For me, though, the theater community was perfect—and it was enough.
This sense of community will be the thing I’ll miss most about Harvard. I’ll keep in touch with my closest friends, but it’s not the same for the communities we build here. You can’t recreate the feeling of belonging you get walking across the Yard and saying hi to the numerous acquaintances who you met at some extracurricular function. I always loved going to theater-related classes during shopping week and seeing rooms filled with familiar faces. Even if those faces didn’t belong to those in my immediate social circle, it was comforting to notice them and be among those with passions similar to mine.
Out in the “real world,” I’m sure people with equally matched interests will similarly surround me. There’s a freedom about this place, though, that allows these vibrant communities to thrive in a manner they can’t in a more professional setting. We can experiment and fail and challenge each other in ways that are simply unfeasible when money becomes a factor. The American Repertory Theater must plan their seasons with an eye to profit; the HRDC can perform a play with more objectionable content than a Bertolucci film and pay no attention to audience sizes. The experience is what matters, and it is participation in these experiences that compel a random group of people to form a true kinship.
Most Harvard students contribute to multiple communities of some sort. Our mutual experiences at this turbulent and intense place make it nearly impossible not to feel a sense of belonging in some way or another. I never shared in enough Kirkland experiences to become a genuine part of that community, but I did find my own affiliation elsewhere.
Truly, the best thing to do on this campus is to contribute—to find the group that feels like the right fit and engage with the people around you. These communities—whether your House or not—are what make Harvard feel like home. They’re the reason that I think years from now, when I encounter fellow alumni and they ask the age-old question, I’ll be more than happy to tell them that during my four years at Harvard, I lived in Kirkland—sort of.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I arrived at Harvard a wide-eyed freshman with no idea what to expect. I was constantly amazed by everything around me. There were always frozen yogurt and chickwiches on demand in Annenberg? I could study in a library with a Gutenberg bible? Anything I did resulted in a free t-shirt?
Hailing from the Midwest, the only people I knew at Harvard before moving in were those whom I had met during Prefrosh Weekend (sure to be long-lasting friends, of course) and other students from Illinois whom I had met before school (everyone was interested in introducing me to their aunt’s coworker’s sister’s step-son’s best friend’s neighbor who was also going to Harvard). I quickly latched onto my roommates: Living with five other girls was a fun, never-ending slumber party that I—who only had two brothers—absolutely loved. We were complete greenhorns in everything we did, but that didn’t stop us from enjoying every second of it. We often stayed in the dining hall from brunch through dinner on Sundays, telling stories about our weeks and laughing the entire time. The entire campus was our oyster.
One night at a party, one of my roommates and I walked past two senior girls pointing at freshmen and talking about them. “They get worse and worse every year,” we heard one girl say, as the freshmen started dancing. At that point, my roommate and I promised ourselves never to be so jaded—as we simultaneously compared our outfits to the other girls’ to make sure we weren’t as egregiously out of place. What had happened to these two seniors to make them so unhappy that not only were they refusing to get a little bit softer now during “Shout” on the dance floor, but they also felt the need to waste their time criticizing girls who were three years younger than they and surely meant them no harm?
Fast-forward to the beginning of my senior year. After our closest group of male friends graduated, my friends and I decided that this year would be the year of the “Gurlparty.” We might not have any Y chromosomes in the mix, but we would make our own fun, even if it was the last thing we did! After a few weeks of forcing ourselves to stay out late and party like freshmen, though, we suddenly found ourselves wanting to go to sleep on Friday nights, watching movies instead of going to bars (ironic, since we were all legal by now). With e-recruiting season affecting most of us, we soon became the “Galparty”—suits and practice interviews replaced our theme-party costumes and thrilling adventures. It was official: We were both boring and bored. Episodes of “Law & Order: SVU” instantly streaming on Netflix provided a much-needed respite from a college scene that we had officially worn out.
Post-spring break, though, something changed. We started going out four nights a week (sorry, parents—at least I handed my thesis in!). Our meals in the dining halls got longer and longer. We even made some new friends. With college’s expiration date constantly thrust into my line of sight via impending deadlines related to graduation and countless emails counting down the days until May 26, I suddenly felt like I lacked the time to do everything I wanted. When was I going to go to the Chihuly exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts? Would it ever stop raining enough for me to be able to jump off the Weeks Footbridge? I realized that I had come nowhere near to exhausting the options of things to do at Harvard. By thinking that I was obsolete and needed to move onto the next stage of life, I had deprived myself of the chance to see everything that was still fresh and exciting around me.
Next year, I will once again be a complete newbie—tasks like finding an apartment and figuring out how to invest my money are extraordinarily daunting. Yet I know that I will figure them out and eventually settle into adult life. What I will take away from my time at Harvard, though, is that there is no reason to ever stop being a novice. Experience is, in many ways, a helpful tool to get us through life, but curiosity and amazement make living much more enjoyable. After a year feeling like an old, crotchety grandma, I am ready to spend the rest of my life as a freshman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, while I was walking in Boston with two of my blockmates, I slipped and fell in a huge puddle of clam chowder. Of all the subs¬tances I could have slipped in, clam chowder is certainly not the worst—especially since it didn’t look as though someone had already eaten it—but it was nevertheless pretty disgusting. A smashed knee, a trip to University Health Services, and a tetanus shot later, I was able to laugh about the experience. It seemed almost as if the city itself were taking one last crack at me before I departed.
As an east coaster, Boston didn’t feel particularly foreign when I arrived here freshman year. I lived through plenty of snow days back home; I, too, had never participated in a tornado drill; and when I looked at brick buildings, unlike west coasters, I didn’t start thinking about earthquake regulations. Besides, I had seen Good Will Hunting and read Johnny Tremain.
As a New Yorker, however, Boston felt kind of hostile. One of my blockmates is from Boston; she frequently recites Red Sox-Yankees scores to me (never mind that I’m not a Yankee fan), and could barely look at me when the Giants beat the Patriots freshman year. Being a Bostonian, my blockmate is not unusual in her dislike of my hometown. A recent ad on the T for reruns of Seinfeld read: “Finally, some New Yorkers we can get along with,” or something to that effect. If George Castanza is one of the only likeable New Yorkers, I’d hate to imagine what Boston thinks of the rest of us.
Then again, I would be just as remiss to base my image of Boston on Johnny Tremain. I don’t remember very much about the book’s plot, but I remember learning the term “personification” from its opening passage: “Boston slowly opened its eyes, stretched, and woke. The sun struck in horizontally from the east, flashing upon weather-vanes—brass cocks and arrows, here a glass-eyed Indian, there a copper grasshopper—and the bells in the steeples cling-clanged, telling the people it was time to be up and about.”
Now that I’ve experienced it myself, I know that the sounds of Boston waking up are a bit different. In Pfoho, at 6 a.m. I can hear what I believe are trucks unloading in the courtyard behind Comstock Hall. Sometimes at around 7 a.m., a car drives down Walker Street announcing some sort of parking regulation. By then, if it isn’t pouring, the birds will have started chirping. At 8:25 a.m. the bell for the elementary school rings. It’s already light out, but if the sun has flashed upon any weather vanes, it has also flashed upon the neon-red letters of the Sheraton Commander.
It might sound as if I’m complaining; I’m not. Over the past few years, I’ve grown accustomed to this particular morning symphony, and it will be odd next year to wake up without it. Bostonians might not appreciate New York and its residents, but during my time here, I have come to appreciate this city, despite its attempts to turn me against it.
During senior week, I’ve had an urge to complete a Boston bucket list, exploring parts of this city that I haven’t managed to visit during my four years of school here. It would be easy to use this moment to urge future generations of Harvard students to take better advantage of the place during their time here. But I know as well as anyone else how easy it is to end up primarily campus-bound, caught up in classwork, extracurriculars, House life, and more. And as I’m about to leave campus, it is not that cancelled trip to Revere beach that I will look back on regretfully. Instead, I will be missing the sights, sounds, and smells of the little pieces of this city that have become my familiar haunts.
I might be happy if I never have to ride the green line again, and if I never have to worry that an escaped boa constrictor might show up in my subway car, but I will miss that moment when the red line emerges aboveground at Charles MGH to reveal the harbor and the Boston skyline. I am not sorry to leave Fenway behind, but I will miss random Thursday night trips with my roommate to the Museum of Fine Arts. I will hopefully never have to live through another Boston winter, but I will miss walking back up Garden Street to the Quad in the spring, passing crocuses, tulips, and lilacs on my way.
And let’s be honest—I’m a total nostalgic. I might even end up looking back with fondness on the slowness of the T, the insanity of Red Sox fans, and the treacherousness of black ice in January. After all, most of the time my complaints are just attempts to bait my New York-hating blockmate.
But really, I could have done without that clam chowder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drawing on challenges she has faced as Africa’s first elected female head of state, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf urged Harvard’s Class of 2011 to be hopeful, resilient, and daring in facing life’s obstacles.
Sirleaf—who delivered her remarks at the Afternoon Exercises of the Commencement ceremony Thursday—struck a tone that many audience members described as optimistic and inspiring.
“If your dreams do not scare you,” she told a crowd of thousands of recent graduates and alumni, “they are not big enough.”
Sirleaf, who is up for reelection this November, spent much of her speech discussing her administration’s accomplishments during her first six-year term.
“In five years, we formulated the laws and policies and strategies for growth and development,” she said.
Since taking office in 2006, Sirleaf, a Harvard Kennedy School alumna, said she has nearly eliminated the country’s $4.9 billion external debt; increased national revenue by over 400 percent; restored electricity and tap water to Monrovia, the Liberian capital city; and reconstructed universities, schools, and hospitals.
Yet despite these successes, Sirleaf acknowledged the “awesome” challenges facing Liberia, including civil war in neighboring nations, high costs, and lingering governmental inefficiency and corruption.
Sirleaf—whose reelection bid is being challenged by Winston A. Tubman, a Harvard Law School graduate—praised the “truly free and fair” election process that has been established in Liberia.
She joked that regardless of whether she or Tubman is elected, “the relationship between Harvard and Liberia is thus secured and in good hands.”
Sirleaf also championed the power of women in shaping social change, calling attention to the Liberian women who “fought the final battle for peace” by demonstrating in support of an end to Liberia’s civil war.
While she praised the 2008 presidential election of Barack Obama as one that permanently transformed the American political landscape, she gently chastised the United States for not having yet elected a female president.
“Let me remind you, America, that Liberia has you beat on one score: We elected our first female president, perhaps 11 years before the United States might do so,” she said to an appreciative laughter.
Sirleaf closed her speech by urging graduates to aim high and resist cynicism even in the face of “ample opportunity to become jaded and cynical.”
Allan S. Bradley ’11 said he was particularly moved by Sirleaf’s admonishment against cynicism, adding that her sentiment “means a lot given the questions that we as graduates are asking ourselves.”
Last year former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 delivered the Commencement address. Comedian Amy Poehler delivered this year’s Class Day speech Wednesday.
