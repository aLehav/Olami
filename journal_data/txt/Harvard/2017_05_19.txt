After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is an intensely risky decision, both professionally and personally, to leave a successful band and pursue a solo career. But in his self-titled debut album—his first release since British boyband One Direction went on hiatus—Harry Styles demonstrates a remarkable willingness to try anything and everything. In the record that seeks to establish him as a serious musician, the ex-boybander tries on the musical styles of his predecessors like patterned, designer-brand suits.
With a vocal versatility that lends itself as easily to slow guitar ballads as it does classic British rock, Styles makes it hard to deny the recognition of his talent and musical ear. In “Kiwi,” he tries on the Stones’ rock n’ roll sleaze, emulating the electric guitar riffs of “Gimme Shelter” and “Start Me Up.” And “Sweet Creature” adopts finger-plucked, acoustic guitar in G major—the same key, and nearly the same tempo, in which Paul McCartney wrote and sang “Blackbird.”
That’s not to say that he never branches out on his own. “Woman” builds the most eccentric soundscape of the record, one that opens with a voice talking about Netflix rom-coms and includes distorted electric guitar, a syncopated reggae beat, and even a synthesized duck noise.
If that sounds like a departure from One Direction, his lyricism is also a far cry from hey-girls and yeah-yeahs—but sometimes it’s for the worse. Women on the album tend to fall into hard rock archetypes. The girl in “Carolina” has “a book for every situation” and “gets into parties without an invitation.” The muse for “Only Angel” is secretly “a devil between the sheets” in “a skirt that short.” And the disembodied “pretty face on a pretty neck” in “Kiwi” “worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes,” “in a black dress, she’s such an actress.” It’s disappointing that Styles, outspoken in interviews in his unrelenting support of teenage girls, buys into chauvinistic tropes.
In the nest of these apparent contradictions, Styles negotiates the incongruity between the images of Harry Styles, past, present, and future. There’s boyband Harry and solo Harry—long-haired, quirky introvert and womanizing hard rocker; charismatic, friendly teen idol and newly minted Hollywood actor.
There’s an art to reconciling all of these identities. For Styles, it manifests in a tight control over his privacy, over what the public gets to know about him. As a PR-trained pop star, he is a practiced hand at concealing hard facts with metaphor, dodging probing interview questions with diplomatic answers and winsome charm. But all that suppression builds up. “We don’t talk enough,” he belts in “Sign of the Times,” the nearly six-minute, classic rock first single off the album. “Tongue-tied like we’ve never known,” he croons in “Two Ghosts,” a twangy requiem for lost love. “Telling those stories we already told, / ’Cause we don’t say what we really mean.” And in “From the Dining Table,” a stripped-back track that would not feel out of place on a Bon Iver album, “We haven’t spoke since you went away / Comfortable silence is so overrated.”
Because his lyricism is deeply coded, even veiled details feel like intimate confession. There’s honesty here—not the kind that would be found amid the thudding bass and frivolity of a teen pop album but rather a candor that masks as much as it reveals. “Brooklyn saw me, empty avenues,” he sings in “Ever Since New York,” an acoustic indie track. “There’s no water inside this swimming pool / Almost over, had enough from you.”
Catapulted to hyperbolic fame as part of One Direction, Styles spent his most impressionable years under the public’s magnifying glass. Underneath the glamour of celebrity lies the kind of world in which superficiality prevails, paparazzi accost him at airports and nightclubs, and journalists focus more on his love life than his musical ability. Even Hollywood parties end the next morning in lonely hotel rooms, getting drunk by noon. Is it any wonder he sounds so jaded?
“I’ve never felt less cool,” he sings in the final track of the album. It’s the sort of vulnerability that’s only now being unveiled, a glimpse into the life of a lonely teenage superstar who has set himself free. It’s ironic that Styles laments the inability to say what he means, because this album has proven that he has the power to do just that: to become brazenly, unabashedly himself. And if this is what growing up looks like, it’s a good fit. Or rather, style.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Loveless,” Andrey Zvyagintsev’s Cannes submission, is only on its surface about searching. The film follows the aftermath of a boy named Alyosha (Matvey Novikov) running away from home. His parents, Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and Boris (Alexei Rozin), undertake an agonizing search while trying to build new lives for themselves after a bitter divorce. In the end, whether or not they find Alyosha matters very little—Zvyagintsev makes clear that both are deeply broken, and none of their searching will fix that.
Through long tracking shots, the film follows the couple working with a crew of volunteers as they comb through woods and concrete blocks of apartments, looking for their son. So much effort and screentime is devoted to the search, one is soon forced to ask the question, “Why bother?" Neither of Alyosha’s parents loves him—he ran away because they were going to give him up for adoption. To them, he is nothing but an unfortunate reminder of their shared past, a part of their history they’d like to forget.
Zyagintsev’s and Olga Negin’s skillful dialogue set the pair up as people trapped in situations beyond their control. Much like Zvyagintsev’s last effort, “Leviathan,” the government is no recourse here—the police are useless in finding the boy, and radio and television reports are chock full of corruption scandals and propaganda. Based on this evidence, putting Alyosha up for adoption seems even crueller. It is clear, however, that Boris and Zhenya cannot remain together—their marriage, and their home, was completely loveless.
The only hopeful moments of the film are early on, when Boris and Zhenya are with their new lovers. Zhenya finally seem to have found in Anton (Andris Keishs) a man who loves her for who she is, rather than the fact that she is pregnant with his child. Boris, for his part, has found a sweet and loving woman who longs to start a family with him. In these scenes, the viewer almost wants Alyosha to disappear forever and leave them to their new lives.
Of course, Zvyagintsev cannot let this hope last—the couple cannot be allowed to escape so easily. Instead, the final scenes of the film show that their new relationships are falling apart: Boris is still a bad father, and Zhenya is still unsatisfied, constantly texting someone besides her new husband. In the end, Alyosha almost seems the lucky one—his escape to nature must have been the only free moment of his life.
One of the key lines of the film, uttered by Zhenya’s new lover, states simply, “Lovelessness: one cannot live in that state.” By the conclusion, this state takes on the meaning of state as government. In “Loveless,” Zvyagintsev takes aim at all human institutions. The government is grey, callous, and corrupt. The church, with its emphasis on marriage and the family, is intrusive and judgmental. At one point, Boris is worried that his divorce will affect his job prospects. His boss is a fundamentalist, and will fire him if he discovers such an un-Christian act.
Zvyagintsev is so ambitious in his criticism, in fact, that at times the film feels scattered. The various radio and television reports add color and atmosphere, certainly, but are never connected to the larger story. Neither is Boris’ concern about his job, or Anton’s Skype call to his daughter. Together, they build a central theme of lovelessness, and the institutions that create it. In terms of the plot, however, they add very little.
This is only a small criticism, however. Although the story is well–paced and thrilling—there is no moment that really feels predictable—Zvyagintsev has set out to create the feeling of being trapped without love, rather than a dramatic plot. In this, he succeeds tremendously. By the final credits, the viewer is left wondering if there is any escape from this state. One of the final shots of the film is perfect metaphor for the whole: Zhenya running on a treadmill outside. There is the illusion of forward progress, but its artificiality quickly becomes clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Todd Haynes’s contribution to Cannes this year is two stories in one: Separated by fifty years, two deaf children escape their homes to New York City in search of something new. In 1927, Rose (Millicent Simmons) longs to meet a famous actress, while in 1977, Ben (Oakes Fegley) goes looking for his father after the death of his mother. Along the way, they are harassed by figures of authority, and find refuge in the American Museum of Natural History. Although clichéd, the story finds room for genuine warmth and sweetness, and is worth a watch for any family.
Because “Wonderstruck” focuses on deaf characters, the sound design, soundtrack, and visual storytelling take precedence. Each of these aspects is different for the two timeframes. The scenes in 1927 are in black and white, and trade heavily in the dramatic overtures and hyper–expressive physical acting of films of that era. Haynes recaptures the feel of silent pictures, and uses its tropes such as pianos mimicking sound effects, and one–note characters surrounding a protagonist to create a simple story almost solely through visual storytelling.
Ben’s tale, on the other hand, is a silent film in the modern age. Although much of this section contains audible dialogue, Ben’s main form of communication is writing on a notepad, an update of the classic intertitles. The soundtrack too has moved on from the heavy piano of the ’20s to the lazy guitar riffs and funky bass runs of the ’70s. Where Rose’s story is told in black and white, the more contemporary segments are in vibrant color, making up for the general lack of sound.
There is inherent risk in child–led movies, as truly great child actors are hard to come by. Fegley puts in a very solid performance, and holds down the majority of the film. The segments starring Simmons, however, show off her remarkable talent without giving her a single word. She is the most charming person in the film, and manages to be so simply with her smile and self–cut bob. “Wonderstruck” also stars Julianne Moore, doing excellent work in a double role.
“Wonderstruck” is easily compared to other such heartwarming tales of precocious kids, like “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close” or “Hugo”. The latter comparison makes even more sense, given that both “Hugo” and “Wonderstruck” are adaptations of books by Brian Selznick, who wrote the screenplay for “Wonderstruck” as well. In both cases, the films emphasize the importance of innocent appreciation for art, beauty, and knowledge.
“Hugo,” however, has a more focused story and theme, while the many threads of “Wonderstruck” lead to a more muddled message. None of the themes within the film clash, per se, but it is difficult to draw the connections between the establishing line of the film—an Oscar Wilde quote, “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars”—and the conclusion. Indeed, it is hard to say what exactly Haynes is trying to do with “Wonderstruck,” other than creating an aesthetic experience.
Perhaps this aspect of the film is its strongest connection to “Hugo” and “Extremely Loud”—in all three cases, aesthetics are valued over cohesion in terms of themes or plot. The emotional climax and denouement of “Wonderstruck” takes the already stylized visuals and pushes them well over the top. The history that connects the twin stories is told by an (extant) panorama in miniature of all of New York City, and (made–up) tiny scale models with faces framed by lockets. There appears to be no good reason for any of this theatrics, other than the fact that it is gorgeous.
This is not to say that “Wonderstruck” is not a moving film, or does not have sublime moments. The most remarkable scene features three characters: one deaf person and one hearing person who speak sign language, and one deaf person who doesn’t. The difficulties of communicating in such a situation beautifully stagger the emotional moments in the lead up to the climax, and gives aesthetic space for them to land.
Overall, “Wonderstruck” is a sweet but simple movie, and should be praised for representing the many hearing–impaired children in the world. It will be interesting to hear reactions from those in the hearing–impaired community, as the film may stray into the territory of fetishizing the “specialness” of their condition. However, it largely seems to avoid that charge, and instead beautifully, if simply, tells the story of two deaf children from their own, often disregarded, position.
