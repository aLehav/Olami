After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here are the confessions of a new ambient noise connoisseur:
When Spotify released everyone’s 2020 Wrapped results at the start of December, I was much more enthused than in years past. Not only would it serve as an interesting time capsule of my main coping mechanism throughout this awful year, but I also felt I had made huge strides in improving and expanding my musical taste over the past 12 months. Once you spend a solid five-year block of your life listening to One Direction’s discography and the Hamilton cast album almost exclusively, you often feel — as I did upon starting college — the need to atone for some of your past musical sins.
I had clicked on my Spotify stats, trying to anticipate whether they’d provide my ego with a much needed boost. Would I be able to hop on the social media bandwagon like everyone else with some cool, edgy list or would I be too ashamed by my basic choices to post? Maybe my top song would be something by Hozier or even Fiona Apple. Or, more realistically, it’d probably be something from Harry Styles (you know, old habits die hard).
Instead, as I made it to the notorious “One song helped you get through it all” slide, I was greeted not by a man sitting in an armchair underwater but rather a simple windshield covered in rain drops. “Relaxing Rain Sounds for Deep Sleep | 2 Hours,” it read, almost mockingly.
I’m not sure how I hadn’t seen this coming, considering I let about eight hours worth of white noise play as I went to bed each night. I guess I had thought, rather foolishly, that Spotify would know better and filter the rain tracks out from the rest of my “real” music. Instead, ambient noise had infected my entire Wrapped run-down and rendered it pretty much worthless — “Relaxing Water Sounds” even cracked my Top Three Artists.
Of course, I was quite perturbed at first and vowed to purchase an actual white noise machine for Christmas, in an effort to preserve my Wrapped 2021. But after a few weeks of reflection, I’ve decided to instead embrace my enthusiasm for background noise head on. While I couldn’t flex my great taste to the musical snobs on my Instagram this time around, I can now show off my refined knowledge of sleep-inducing soundtracks, earned through many months of sophisticated experiments.
I can say, with confidence, that “Relaxing Rain Sounds for Deep Sleep” was indeed the song “that helped [me] through it all” — a perfect, absurdist representation of my 2020 experience.
If you, like me, have recently moved into a hundred-year-old building that’s almost certainly haunted by New England ghosts, the last thing you want to hear late at night in a pitch black room is dead silence: An effective atmospheric playlist is, thus, a no-brainer.
You might think the soundtrack possibilities are endless, but I would, first of all, strongly caution you to avoid the podcast route. Waking up at the dreaded witching hour to a description of a heinous murder on one of my favorite true-crime podcasts was enough to permanently steer me towards wordless nightime selections only.
Rainforest sounds, whale calls, and beach waves are all respectable white noise choices under normal circumstances. Yet, there’s something painful about hearing tree frogs croak or seagulls squawk when the most adventurous place you’ve visited in the past nine months was probably Trader Joe’s. The goal with white noise should always be to drown out those pesky things called late-night thoughts, not invite new ones about tropical vacations that ceased to materialize.
I’d therefore argue that none of the options is better suited for the socially distanced lifestyle than a good ol’ rain storm. Each night, I can trick myself into believing that the only reason I spent the whole day cooped up in my apartment, trying to trick my brain into reading for fun and unsuccessfully attempting a Chloe Ting workout was just because of some bad weather. It’s fun to pretend that in 2020, we just had about 300 consecutive days of rain checks.
—Outgoing Columns Exec Samantha J. O’Connell dipped her toe into art journalism mainly to compensate for the fact that she used to worship One Direction and her favorite film of all time used to be “Ella Enchanted.” It didn’t really work. Highbrow art is cool and all, but she continues to listen to the album “FOUR” and will forever enjoy Anne Hathaway singing “Somebody to Love” at a giant’s wedding for the rest of her days.

10. “Miss Juneteenth”
The story of a mother living vicariously through her daughter’s pageant participation has certainly been told before, but never has it been told with as much heart and depth as in “Miss Juneteenth.” The film follows Turquoise Jones (Nicole Benarie), a former winner of Fort Worth’s Miss Juneteenth pageant, as she struggles to make ends meet by working two jobs while also training her 15-year-old daughter, Kai (Alexis Chikaeze), to follow in her Miss Juneteenth footsteps. Though the film originally debuted at Sundance on Jan. 24, it saw a spike in popularity with its widespread release on the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, at a time when demand for Black stories told by Black creators was at an all-time high. Although the story beats are somewhat predictable, masterful atmosphere-building coupled with Benarie’s breakout performance result in a candid tale of the joys and hardships of Black motherhood. — Hunter T. Baldwin
We included “Miss Juneteenth” as one of our recommendations for movies to watch instead of “The Help.” Read more here.
9. “Soul”
Released just in time to qualify for this list, “Soul” was the perfect Christmas gift to end this rather tough year. Following Joe Gardner’s (Jamie Foxx) journey from New York to The Great Before and back again, Pixar’s latest film is both stunning and smart. It is metaphysical in the simplest of ways, and — underneath the beautiful artistry, animation, and sound design — manages to sneak in a profound message about the meaning of life. — Kalos K. Chu
We reviewed “Soul” and gave it 4.5/5 stars. Read more here.
8. “Emma” 
Though the original Jane Austen romance has been remade several times, Autumn de Wilde’s adaptation brings fresh humor, richness, and intimacy to the classic tale of matchmaking gone wrong. Anya Taylor-Joy is delightfully precocious as Emma, countered by the equally charming Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley. Like Joe Wright’s cult-favorite “Pride and Prejudice” (2005), the film is beautifully shot and designed, and the portrayal of high society in Regency England is irreverently absurd. In a rough year spent mostly inside, “Emma.” felt like a ray of sunshine. — Harper R. Oreck
We reviewed “Emma.” and gave it 4.5/5 stars. Read more here. 
7. “I’m Thinking of Ending Things”
Like many of Charlie Kaufman’s films, “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” is hard to wrap your head around — but parsing out (some of) the meaning behind this haunting, atmospheric drama is well worth it. What begins as the story of a man (Jesse Plemons) bringing his girlfriend (Jessie Buckley) home to meet his parents (Toni Collette and David Thewlis) spirals out into an unnerving, gorgeous exploration of memory, perception, and loneliness. The film shifts constantly and unpredictably into new tones and conflicts, succeeding both as an unexpectedly harrowing family drama and a work of innovation in modern filmmaking and narrative structure. Toni Collette is dynamically scene-stealing, per usual. And it’s also just a fascinating (albeit dark) movie to watch and discuss with friends or family, as some of its twists may take unpacking but are sure to stick in your head for days (or months) to come. —Harper R. Oreck 
We reviewed “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” and found it risky, odd, and worth watching. Read more here.
6. “Lovers Rock”
In a year defined by isolation, “Lovers Rock” delivers a powerful burst of collective euphoria. The film — one entry in director Steve McQueen’s “Small Axe” anthology — follows the events of a Blues Party in 1980s London, focusing in particular on the burgeoning romance between Martha (Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn) and Franklyn (Micheal Ward). McQueen uses movement and music to drive his film forward, relying only minimally on dialogue; the cinematography reveals the desires and fears of characters with impressive intimacy, as the camera weaves gracefully through dancing couples and awkward bystanders alike. As an aesthetic experience, “Lovers Rock” is totally immersive. Although grounded firmly in the context of London’s West Indian community, the sense of togetherness that serves as the film’s beating heart is universal. — Connor S. Dowd
We reviewed “Lovers Rock,” and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here.
5. “The Half of It”
This was a big year for both Asian American (“Tigertail,” “Never Have I Ever”) and queer (“The Prom,” “The Boys in the Band”) representation on Netflix. One of the most powerful films of the year, however, managed to combine the two: telling the story of high school senior Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) with poignancy, nuance, and more than a dash of wit. It was, by itself, a beautiful film — an exploration of love and growing up filled with plenty of heartfelt and compelling relationships — but its choice to feature a queer Asian American protagonist makes for a refreshing and powerful addition to the teen coming-of-age genre. — Kalos K. Chu
We reviewed “The Half of It” and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here.
4. “Boys State”
The indie studio A24 has a reputation in Hollywood for its incredibly inventive, stylish, and provocative films — and this year’s “Boys State” was no different. Centered around Texas’ Boys State summer program where a thousand teenage boys are invited to build a representative government (replete with platforms, parties, and elections) from scratch, the documentary maps out the political coming-of-age arcs of some of the camp’s more active participants. “Boys State” presents surprisingly useful insights into our own contemporary political climate, and amidst the partisan fighting, also features several touching moments of progress, cooperation, and mutual respect between supposed enemies — something that, as one of the documentary’s subjects Robert McDougall said in an interview, “you don’t see in actual big-world politics” too often. —Samantha J. O’Connell
We reviewed “Boys State” and gave it 5/5 stars. Read more here.
3. “Nomadland”
Written, edited and directed by Chloé Zhao, “Nomadland” is a beautiful portrait of life on the outskirts of mainstream society. Zhao’s film follows Fern (Francis McDormand), a woman in her 60s who moves to the American West and lives as a nomad after losing her livelihood in the Great Recession. With stunning wide-angle landscape shots and a powerful central performance, Zhao’s film soars as a critique of capitalism and how it has disenfranchised millions of Americans. Unlike recent critiques (like Todd Phillips’ “Joker"), Zhao’s film doesn’t merely point to a problem; rather, she puts audiences firmly in the headspace of her central character, until we don’t just relate to her — we understand the tiniest minutiae of her motivations. Zhao’s respect for both the story and its characters is palpable, and aided in large part by her decision to cast real nomads in prominent supporting roles. “Nomadland” looks to anchor the upcoming awards season, alongside technical juggernauts like David Fincher’s “Mank.” — Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed "Nomadland" at the New York Film Festival and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here.
2. “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm”
“Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,” written and produced by Sacha Baron Cohen, skewers contemporary American politics with a simple thesis: Americans are willing to put up with bigotry if people around them do. What does that look like? One store owner willingly sells a cage to Borat so that his daughter can “live” inside it, while a baker unquestioningly frosts an anti-Semitic message on top of a cake. The “best” moment comes when Borat runs through CPAC dressed as a Klansman — at which no one bats an eyelash. (Hmm.) The satirical film elicits chuckles, as Baron Cohen intended, but ultimately, it is a political film, and the message is right at the end. The whole premise would be more funny if it weren’t so tragic. — Cassandra Luca
We reviewed “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” and gave it 4.5 stars. Read more here.
1. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” 
Directed by George C. Wolfe and based on the play of the same name, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” gives viewers a look into an afternoon recording session of Ma Rainey and her band. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” stars powerhouses Viola Davis as Ma Rainey and the late Chadwick Boseman as her band’s trumpeter, who both perfectly capture the film’s 1927 Chicago aesthetic. With its heart-wrenching love stories, rapid-fire dialogue, beautiful blues music, and exceptional acting, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” makes the legendary “Mother of Blues” a household name for its 2020 audience. — Annie Harrigan
Sections
10. “The Haunting of Bly Manor”
Despite featuring much of the same cast as its predecessor and following the same nonlinear model of storytelling, “The Haunting of Bly Manor” tells a completely different story than the first installment in Mike Flanagan’s “The Haunting” anthology. This miniseries tells the story of a young American woman, Dani (Victoria Pedretti), running away from her past as she begins working as an au pair for the two children who live in the eponymous manor in the English countryside. The plot is complex but very compelling with its heart-wrenching stories of love, death, and family drama. The entire cast puts on incredible performances, but the most memorable ones come from the show’s two child actors Amelie Bea Smith (who played Flora) and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (who played Miles) as they keep up with — and, at times, outshine — the older, more experienced adults actors. With an endearing lesbian love story, haunting apparitions, and creepy British children, “The Haunting of Bly Manor” is the perfectly bingeable show for any horror or drama fan. — Annie Harrigan
9. “The Last Dance”
As far as source material for documentaries goes, “The Last Dance” could hardly have asked for better content. This ESPN docuseries chronicles the legendary career of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, whose immensely successful and often tumultuous time in the NBA has long been the object of romanticization and criticism alike. Using Jordan’s last season on the Chicago Bulls — his “last dance” as a member of the team — as a framing device, the series explores all of the triumphs and struggles of Jordan’s story while recreating the experience of his meteoric rise in real time. As a palliative for basketball fans who craved sports entertainment after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, “The Last Dance” filled the void admirably by editing and presenting old game footage in such a way that famous results felt like unexpected miracles all over again. And as an examination of the personal life of an eccentric basketball genius, the series offered enough drama and intrigue to keep anyone entertained. — Connor S. Dowd
8. “The Umbrella Academy,” Season Two
In its second season, Netflix’s adaptation of Gerard Way and Gabriel Bà’s superhero comic series sends the Hargreeves siblings back in time and on another journey to stop the end of the world. The Umbrella Academy must confront the impending apocalypse and their complicated family dynamics in the unfamiliar setting of 1960s Dallas, where obstacles abound. Heartfelt performances from the cast and fast-paced action set to a memorable soundtrack help the show defy expectations as often as space-time traveler Number Five, played by Aidan Gallagher, defies the laws of physics. — Clara V. Nguyen
7. “Feel Good,” Season One
“Feel Good” is a show about queer love that will take your breath away — full of intimate, autobiographical detail and rich, well-earned moments of catharsis. As it chronicles the life of an ex-addict and stand-up comedian who falls in love with a middle school teacher, “Feel Good” leans into the mess and brokenness of love in a way that few other portrayals of queer romance have ever dared. Throughout this self-portrait of their past struggles with addiction and romance, Martin isn’t just unafraid to shy away from their dark edges — they also bring their beloved comedic creativity to every line. — Joy C. Ashford
6. “Cheer”
It’s rare to watch a documentary so unforced — so respectful of its subjects, so organic and in-the-moment — that can also hook viewers in every scene. Perhaps it’s because competitive cheerleading is rarely boring. Perhaps it’s because Navarro College’s team of cheerleaders is chock-full of bejeweled athletes with wildly different life experiences, each of them replete with a depth and endurance that leaves you eager to really understand them. Whatever your opinion on this endorphin-fueled, unforgiving sport, you will come away from “Cheer” with a renewed sympathy for the kids who have given it their everything. — Joy C. Ashford
5. “The Midnight Gospel”
Pendleton Ward and Duncan Trussell’s Netflix animated series transforms audio from Trussell’s podcast into the interstellar adventures of “spacecaster” Clancy Gilroy, who uses a faulty multiverse simulator to interview residents of faraway worlds. Whether following Clancy’s travels through outer space or life at home on the Chromatic Ribbon, each episode explores profound questions worth contemplating in any universe. The show’s vibrant visuals and inspiring conversations make for a brilliant combination of genres. — Clara V. Nguyen
We reviewed “The Midnight Gospel” and found it innovative and powerful. Read more here.
4. “I May Destroy You”
A challenging and devastating examination of sex, violence, and consent, “I May Destroy You” was the year’s most singular artistic tour de force. Michaela Coel created, wrote, directed, starred in, and generally masterminded the 12-episode series, which aired weekly on HBO in an old-school rollout. The genre-defying show was discomforting and darkly hilarious in equal measure, building out its initial premise — millennial author Arabella (Coel) navigates her trauma in the aftermath of being sexually assaulted — into a nuanced critique of modern dating culture and the myriad ways, large and small, in which we harm each other every day. Bolstered by sublimely saturated visuals and star-making performances from Weruche Opia and Paapa Essiedu as Arabella’s best friends Terry and Kwame, “I May Destroy You” was the closest TV got in 2020 to required viewing. — Amelia Roth-Dishy 
3. “The Mandalorian,” Season Two
Backed by cutting edge visual effects and a riveting score by Academy Award- winning composer Ludwig Göransson (Black Panther), “The Mandalorian” has flourished — not just as a technical achievement, but as a cultural phenomenon. After the first season took viewers to fringe corners of a galaxy far far away, showrunner Jon Favreau brought “The Mandalorian” back to its Star Wars roots in Season Two. This nostalgic turn included fan favorites such as Boba Fett, Ashoka Tano, and a finale that had Star Wars fans everywhere jumping and screaming. The second season of “The Mandalorian” is a reminder of how to handle fan service well — with plenty of character setups that don’t feel like they pander for the sake of pandering. — Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed the premiere of Season Two of "The Mandalorian," and we found it fresh and unique. Read more here.
2. “The Queen’s Gambit”
Scott Frank and Allan Scott’s adaptation of Walter Tevis’ 1983 novel captured audiences’ hearts and minds with its immersive depiction of a young orphan’s ascent to fame in the cutthroat world of competitive chess. The show delivers the quick, heart-stopping suspense of a sports drama while also offering an intimate portrait of adolescence, drug addiction, and a young woman’s struggle to find fulfillment. It’s also a brilliantly-designed period piece, and the intricate sets and costumes work together to create a mesmerizing picture of life and travel in the 1960s. Anya Taylor-Joy’s performance as the protagonist Beth, backed up by a dynamic cast of well-drawn characters, ensure that “The Queen’s Gambit” stands out as an engrossing, completely unique watch. — Harper R. Oreck
We reviewed The Queen’s Gambit and called it thrilling, rewarding, and smart. Read more here.
1. “Normal People”
Based on Sally Rooney’s sensational 2018 novel, this Hulu series follows the messy and deeply intimate relationship between two rural Irish teenagers, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), as they struggle through high school and college. The instant chemistry between the couple lit audiences on fire — and also made the series’ dreaded ending all the more soul-crushing. A stunning depiction of first love, “Normal People” manages to bring to life a novel dominated by complex inner voice — not particularly ideal for a TV adaptation — and still convey its themes of social status, power imbalance, and insecurity so effectively on screen. What starts as a star-crossed lovers tale between a popular boy and a wealthy but disliked girl quickly evolves into a much more nuanced portrait of a soul-connection, constantly haunted by communication problems and ghosts of the past. — Samantha J. O’Connell
We reviewed “Normal People” and found it sensual, powered by fantastic lead performances, and adapted masterfully from its source material. Read more here.

10. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” — Fiona Apple 
“Fetch the Bolt Cutters” has been described by critics as “chaotic,” “jarring,” “rough-hewn,” and “claustrophobic,” and it is these exact qualities that make the project the resounding success that it is. Percussive and off-beat, dissonant and playful, Fiona Apple’s fifth studio album is beautifully imperfect — displaying a vulnerability unlike what we’ve come to expect from an often-mechanical music industry. As one of the first major albums released during the COVID-19 pandemic, its themes of isolation and freedom prove both eerily relatable and remarkably inspiring. — Hunter T. Baldwin
We recently examined “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” within the context of Apple’s career more broadly. Read more here.
9. “Plastic Hearts” — Miley Cyrus
On her seventh studio album “Plastic Hearts,” Cyrus finally gives into the rock and roll persona she had been teasing ever since her Disney Channel days — and she does so spectacularly. The album is a glittering explosion of glam rock and pop influences through which Cyrus’s gritty, powerful vocals and iconoclastic persona shine. Tracks like “Midnight Sky” and “Night Crawling” pay a nostalgic homage to the rock giants of the past, all while exemplifying Cyrus’s refusal to stick to one particular era of influence. She cycles through a range of sounds, from stadium ballads to new wave tracks, and does each justice. Of course, Cyrus is no stranger to shocking music and career shifts (lest we forget her headline-grabbing transition from Miley Ray Stewart to controversial pop star), but it seems that on “Plastic Hearts” she has finally found her sound as an artist. — Sofia Andrade
8. “folklore” — Taylor Swift
Swift at once returned to her country roots and uncovered whole new veins for her storytelling with two surprise albums this year, the first just barely edging out its recently-released sister. “folklore” descended like a warm blanket in July, providing an unexpected soundtrack to the profound loneliness of 2020. Developed in collaboration with the National’s Aaron Dessner (plus superproducer Jack Antonoff and a helping hand from the mysterious William Bowery, better known as Swift’s low-profile boyfriend Joe Alwyn), the album is a rich tapestry of gothic aesthetics, crunchy leaf piles and cobblestones, and the heart-rending details of loves past and present on which Swift has built her legacy as a songwriter. It’s one of the best albums of her career and certainly the one where, singing of worlds beyond herself, she sounds the most at home. — Amelia Roth-Dishy
We reviewed “folklore” and gave it a perfect 5 stars. Read more here.
7. YHLQMDLG — Bad Bunny
Released on “Leap Day,” Feb. 29, “YHLQMDLG” is Bad Bunny’s sophomore album and was, until then, his most aggressively reggaeton release. (He has since released one additional album and a compilation of songs not originally intended for audiences, satisfying fans worldwide.) In this case, “aggressive” is the best possible thing to be; the entire album crackles with energy. Highlights include “Pero Ya No,” “Soliá,” "Está Cabrón Ser Yo," and “Yo Perreo Sola,” all of which capture the best of Bad Bunny’s range — listen now before he wins the Grammy for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album next year. At the risk of being wrong, we’re calling it now. — Cassandra Luca
6. “Punisher” — Phoebe Bridgers
Three years after her debut “Stranger in the Alps,” Bridgers finally released “Punisher,” her critically acclaimed sophomore album. Written and recorded sporadically throughout the past two years, “Punisher” was released into a world very different from the one it was created in, and yet still managed to capture the spirit of 2020 through its drawn out explorations of isolation and intimacy. When we reviewed the album back in June, we called it a “slow burn,” citing the album’s final track, “I Know The End,” where the album’s various sounds and themes coalesce into “almost six straight minutes of unadulterated ascent.” Indeed, Bridgers’s skill at reflecting her sadness proves cathartic for the listeners drawn into it, cementing the album as a defining one for the year. — Sofia Andrade
We reviewed “Punisher” and gave it 5/5 stars. Read more here.
5. “Good News” — Megan Thee Stallion
One word: Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody. Like Mitski and Rihanna before her, Megan Thee Stallion managed to capture the hearts of critics and audiences alike with a chorus made up of little more than a single phrase. And that’s just the start of what Megan’s debut album “Good News” has to offer. From the cutting lyrics of opening diss track “Shots Fired” to the dancehall stylings of “Intercourse (feat. Popcaan & Mustard),” each song on “Good News” is a celebration of Black womanhood and a testament to Megan’s skills as a rising performer. In a year marked by misfortune after misfortune, we could all use some “Good News,” and that is exactly what the original Hot Girl delivers. — Hunter T. Baldwin
4. “Ho, why is you here?” — Flo Milli
Best known for her viral TikTok song “Beef FloMix,” 20-yearold rapper Flo Milli released her debut mixtape “Ho, why is you here?” on July 24. The mixtape gained great critical acclaim — rightfully so. Flo Milli’s flow is instantly recognizable, completely unique, and beyond impressive for a young, up and coming rapper. With lines like “All they do is talk shit like a toilet with some lips” and “Ladies, listen, I ain't talking 'bout fitness when I say / These n***** weak (Eww),” the mixtape is rife with humorous, sharp lyrics, expertly delivered in Flo Milli’s distinctive tongue-in-cheek style. “Ho, why is you here?” is the perfect body of work for anyone looking to feel, as Flo Milli would put it, “Like That Bitch.” — Annie Harrigan
3. “Ungodly Hour” — Chloe x Halle
Two years after the release of their debut album “The Kids Are Alright,” R&B singer-songwriter duo (and sisters) Chloe x Halle have returned with their critically acclaimed sophomore album “Ungodly Hour.” Released June 12, delayed a week from its original scheduled release date in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, “Ungodly Hour” shows the growth of Chloe x Halle’s artistry. The album, co-written by the sisters and heavily produced by Chloe, is an R&B record with pop, hip-hop, and soul influences. “Ungodly Hour” navigates messy situations, self acceptance, love, and being unapologetically yourself. The singers’ voices and harmonies are incomparable, the lyricism is impressive for artists so young, and the production is immaculate. With its three nominations at the upcoming Grammy Awards, “Ungodly Hour” exceeded expectations and completely avoided the dreaded sophomore slump. — Annie Harrigan
2. “Sawayama” — Rina Sawayama
A conglomeration of nu metal, dance pop, R&B, and rock influences, Japanese-British singer songwriter Rina Sawayama’s debut album “Sawayama” has something for everyone. The album gives listeners a peek into the life of its titular artist with songs about family, friends, identity, and dealing with racism. With tracks reminiscent of a 2000s Evanescence but also a 2000s Britney Spears, “Sawayama” takes listeners on a musical journey through a myriad of genres, themes, and emotions. If you’re looking for something to dance, cry, sing, or headbang to, “Sawayama” is just the album for you. — Annie Harrigan
1. “Set My Heart on Fire Immediately” — Perfume Genius
Perfume Genius has been releasing music for over 10 years, but it’s on this unforgettable album that he truly finds his stride. Released in the quiet of early quarantine, “Set My Heart On Fire Immediately” is labored, frenzied, and electrifying — an intimate portrait of untamed artistry and emotion. Let the album take you with it on its reckless rollercoaster of sound and feeling; you won’t be disappointed. — Joy C. Ashford

10. The Death of Quibi
It was supposed to usher in a new era of mobile entertainment; it was going to be bigger than Netflix, than YouTube — indeed, a bit of a combination of the two. Founder Jeffrey Katzenberg (of Disney and Dreamworks fame), along with most of the entertainment world, had high hopes for Quibi. The original $1 billion in funding came from investors like The Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal, and pretty much every big name in entertainment one can think up — all for a platform that produced 10-minute clips that you could watch in portrait orientation. Six months after its April 2020 launch, however, it announced its closure — proving that no one can really predict what will and won’t work in the world of streaming. — Kalos K. Chu
9. Ziwe’s IG Live Show
This year, appointment television may well have been resurrected on Instagram Live. Ziwe Fumudoh, a comedian previously best known as a writer for “Desus & Mero” and for putting on truly bonkers live performances, took her popular Youtube show “Baited with Ziwe” to social media each week as she gleefully and calmly “baited” non-Black comedians and celebrities into exposing their racial biases. Ziwe has hosted the show since 2017, but in a year of racial reckoning and subsequent performative neoliberal gesturing towards anti-racism, her biting interviews — and the obvious deep discomfort of her guests as Ziwe asked them questions like “What do you like qualitatively about Black people?” — served as a clarion call for the conversation to push further. It was Ziwe’s Internet this year; we were all just living in it. — Amelia Roth-Dishy
8. The Fly on Mike Pence’s Head
This iconic moment came during the singular vice-presidential debate, when the animated dead body known as Vice President Mike Pence appeared to attract animal life. The fly lingered there for merely a moment or two, but it was ample time for people to take pictures, create memes, and lambast the current administration. You can imagine how creative the jokes became (What do flies eat? Etc.). It was a bonding moment for frustrated viewers and young people whose lives had prepared them for the illustrious moment of making (further) mockery of the vice president. — Cassandra Luca
7. Wendy Williams on “The Masked Singer” 
With her ad-libbed “a little vampin’,” perfectly-timed snorts, and pair-of-lips costume, Wendy Williams’s Oct. 28th rendition of the song “Native New Yorker” on Fox’s “The Masked Singer” took the internet by storm this November. A segment of the talk-show host’s off-key, laughter-filled cover became a viral sound on TikTok, and now over 36,000 videos on the app are associated with the clip. Williams may have been booted from the singing competition show based on her “Native New Yorker” attempt, but Gen Z was quick to immortalize the iconic clip and even rank each of her bizarre “oos,” “ahhs” and chuckles throughout. Perfectly coinciding with Election “week,” perhaps the most surreal and stressful five days of the year, the sweet distraction provided by Williams’ ridiculous performance ensured that it would earn a lasting legacy in TikTok history. — Samantha J. O’Connell
6. Elon’s Musk’s and Grimes’ Baby Name
In a plot twist exemplary of 2020, Grimes and Elon Musk are a couple, and have one son. His name is X AE A-XII, with “X” being the first name, and the rest being a middle name. Sources tell us that the pronunciation goes “EKS-ash-AY-twelv.” Twitter tells us that this name is ridiculous — the original spelling of which was deemed illegal since Æ is not an English letter — and, frankly, an unfair name to give to a child. Born in May of this year, Musk’s and Grimes’ son is still the subject of spirited tweets and genuine confusion. Stay tuned to see what happens when he goes to kindergarten. — Cassandra Luca
5. K-Pop Stans and the Tulsa Trump Rally
On June 21, a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was fantastically hijacked by K-pop stans on TikTok. 10 days before the event, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted that the campaign had received over a million ticket requests for Trump’s first rally during the pandemic. The rally organizers even set up extra outdoor seating to complement the venue’s 19,000-person capacity, complete with a makeshift stage. When Trump arrived that Saturday to deliver his opening remarks, however, he was greeted with a largely empty venue. According to the Tulsa Fire Marshal’s Office, less than 6,200 of the seats were actually full. At the root of this discrepancy between ticket requests and actual attendees was a coordinated protest pushed by Gen Z TikTokers and K-pop fans who flooded the campaign system with ticket requests with no intention of going. The iconic online protest left the Trump campaign dumbfounded, and became a truly memorable example of what solidarity looks like in a pandemic. — Sofia Andrade
4. Gal Gadot’s “Imagine” Video
Back in March, when we were still talking about the pandemic in terms of impending weeks rather than months or years, Gal Gadot gathered her famous friends to help uplift the quarantined masses through song. One by one, assorted celebrities implicated themselves in a dazzling display of class privilege by singing lines from John Lennon’s “Imagine” from their marble bathrooms and backyard orchards, redefining cringe in the process. “I meant to do something good and pure, and it didn’t transcend,” Gadot told Vanity Fair in October. It certainly did transcend — just not in the way she hoped. Gadot et al. were the first in a long line of celebrities that would go on to make absolute clowns of themselves during 2020 from the comfort of their own million-dollar homes. But you always remember your first. — Amelia Roth-Dishy
We recently examined the legacy of this video, six months later. Read more here.
3. Elliot Page Comes Out
It’s been a big year for Elliot Page. His 2019 documentary “There’s Something in the Water” debuted on Netflix in March, followed by Season Two of “The Umbrella Academy” in June, in which Page once again stole the spotlight as troubled superhero Vanya Hargreeves. Perhaps the greatest moment for the activist and actor, however, came on Dec. 1, when Page publicly came out as trans. In a heartfelt letter shared on his social media, Page wrote “I want to share with you that I am trans, my pronouns are he/they and my name is Elliot.” The message — in which Page expresses the joy they feel in pursuing their authentic self while also centering the experiences of trans people of color — was met by overwhelming support by Page’s fans, friends, and co-stars. The moment marks a tremendous one for transmasculine visibility, and it sparked valuable discussions on the treatment of trans individuals by popular media. — Hunter T. Baldwin 
2. "Parasite" wins Best Picture
No foreign language film has ever won the Academy Award for Best Picture — until "Parasite." Just a year after frontrunner “Roma” lost in a stunning upset to “Green Book,” many wondered if the Academy would ever buck that tradition. Other frontrunners included films by Hollywood stalwarts Quentin Tarantino (for “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood”) and Martin Scorsese (for “The Irishman). But in one of 2020’s more pleasant surprises, Bong Joon-ho’s electrifying class-conflict drama didn’t just win Best Picture, but Best Director and Best Original Screenplay as well. All things considered, it’s an Oscars surprise that will make film fans everywhere happy for a long time. — Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed "Parasite" at the Cannes Film Festival. Read more here.
1. The “WAP” Saga
When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion teamed up for their first collaboration, no one could have foreseen the way it would break the internet. “WAP” is a raunchy, upbeat hip-hop song driven by a heavy bass and a repeated sample of Frank Ski’s 1993 club track “Whores in This House.” Its accompanying music video features Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion displaying their sex appeal as they dance in different rooms of an “Alice In Wonderland”-esque mansion, withcameos by Normani, Rosalia, Mulatto, Sukihana, Rubi Rose, and Kylie Jenner. The song and music video sparked many conversations, a viral TikTok dance, bizarre Twitter threads from Republican politicians, and even this essay by one of our Arts board executives. But perhaps the most memorable response to “WAP” was conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro’s dramatic reading of the song’s lyrics, in which he replaced the words “pussy” with “p-word” (later clarifying that “p-word” means “female genitalia”) and “dick” with “d-word.” Shapiro followed his reading of the lyrics with an angry rant about feminism saying “it’s not really about women being treated as independent, full-rounded human beings. It’s about ‘wet ass p-word’.” Cardi B responded to the controversy surrounding her song in true Cardi B fashion, tweeting “I can’t believe conservatives soo mad about WAP." Much to Ben Shapiro’s chagrin (and possibly because of it), “WAP” ended up being one of the biggest songs of 2020, and now, “wet ass p-word” will forever live in internet infamy. — Annie Harrigan

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On my 18th birthday a few winters ago, one music school welcomed me into adulthood with a timely gift in my inbox: a rejection letter. It wasn’t the first, and though I didn’t know at the time, it sure wasn’t going to be the last.
Of course, I much preferred the “Dungeons & Dragons” starter kit my best friend had given me earlier that morning. But instead of deleting the email right away, I stared at my laptop screen and wondered what 12 years at the piano had given me (besides, of course, unhealthy perfectionism and callused hands). The next morning, when my alarm rang at 5:00 a.m. to remind me to practice before school, I turned it off and slept for two more hours.
But the piano wasn’t about to leave my life so easily. It had already embedded itself in everything: our living room, my Instagram username, even my actual name. Still, I managed to keep it mostly at bay for the rest of the school year, relying on muscle memory to power through the few performances I’d scheduled and avoiding questions about whether I’d keep playing in college. In the end, it wasn’t my parents’ irritation or my teachers’ encouragement that saved my musical career — not that there was much of one to begin with. It was 22 episodes of anime.
A few weeks before freshman move-in, Netflix reminded me that I’d enjoyed “Your Lie in April” years before, listing it under the headline “Watch It Again.” So I did.
The first episode introduces Kousei Arima, a fourteen-year-old piano prodigy, and Kaori Miyazono, the violinist who inspires Kousei to rediscover music after he loses the ability to hear his own playing. “Your Lie in April” is the story of both their friendship and what it means to be a musician. It discusses the difficulties of making music — an art form reliant on emotion — in a setting that often equates emotion with weakness, and weakness with failure. Despite its upbeat, ridiculously catchy opening themes, the show made me cry.
Listening to Kousei and Kaori shine onstage also made me realize how much I missed music. With just days until the fall semester, I thought of joining an orchestra on campus. The audition requirements seemed straightforward enough: a fast piece and a slow one. For the former, I chose one of my old favorites: the “Winter Wind” étude, composed by Frédéric Chopin and, more importantly, featured in “Your Lie in April.” Unfortunately, I could barely make it past the first page after months of not practicing.
When Kousei wonders who he is without the piano after a disappointing practice session, Kaori answers: “You’re you, no matter what … You’re not Chopin, after all.” I’m no Chopin — or Kousei Arima, for that matter — and as much as I agreed with Kaori, in no way was I ready to play “Winter Wind” for anyone.
That didn’t stop me from signing up to audition for the River Charles Ensemble, whose sign with glittery foam letters had stood out against the gray sky at an activities fair in the Yard.
I almost didn’t show up. Instead of making the short walk to the music building after breakfast in Annenberg, I went back to my dorm. I still don’t know exactly what made me change my mind again, but it had more than a little to do with how cool “Winter Wind” sounded in episode eight of “Your Lie in April.” I can’t say I played it especially well, but I started and ended on the right notes — which was a pretty big surprise in and of itself. Even more surprising were the welcome message and red rose left outside my door the next evening.
Kousei and Kaori’s first meeting makes Kousei remember a friend’s description of falling in love: “The world around me took on color in a way I never knew it could.” In the last episode, he reflects on how even soloists need support from friends and mentors. At my first orchestra rehearsal of the semester, surrounded by great musicians who would soon become even better friends, I realized that I’d never be alone onstage again — literally. And my world, just like Kousei’s, filled with color.
—Music school reject and incoming Music Executive Clara V. Nguyen probably isn’t practicing piano right now, so she has plenty of time to discuss “Your Lie in April.” To share your thoughts on the show’s arrangement of Chopin’s Ballade no. 1, contact clara.nguyen@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael Schur, if you are reading this, I firmly believe that your next big NBC sitcom should be centered around the writers and editors of a college newspaper’s arts section — a setting rife with enough dumb antics and witty one-liners to fill at least seven seasons. To prove my point, I present to you the Masthead of the 147th Guard of Arts Board of The Harvard Crimson as characters from “Parks and Recreation.”
Allison J. Scharmann: April Ludgate
“I wanted to make fun of stupid people while I get drunk. My two passions.”
Both our fearless leader and a generally fearless person, Scharmann exudes April Ludgate’s signature “I-can-destroy-you-with-a-single-look” energy. Much like April, however, her sharp exterior belies a big, kind, theater-kid heart.
Iris M. Lewis: Chris Traeger
“There is literally nothing in this world that you cannot do.”
Among the two Arts Chairs, Lewis is undoubtedly the good cop. Her relentless optimism makes her a clear Chris Traeger, as does her penchant for running (likely the only member of Crimson Arts capable of doing so (not even like a 5k or anything, just running, period)).
Kalos K. Chu: Andy Dwyer
“Do I have to tuck my shirt in? Because honestly that’s kind of a deal breaker.”
Zoom has truly destroyed any remaining motivation for Chu to get semi-decently dressed. He has conducted several Zoom interviews wearing a dress shirt/jacket on top and boxer briefs on the bottom, and in a recent Zoom call with the President of The Harvard Crimson, managed to change from jeans into sweatpants without being discovered.
Joy C. Ashford: Leslie Knope
“There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives.”
It is difficult to tell how many hours of sleep Ashford has received on any given day. Yet, like a gay, chaotic Leslie Knope, she faces life with unbridled optimism, energy, and determination — committed toward making everyone’s lives (whether they be Crimson Arts compers, COVID contacts, or the people of the greater Philadelphia area) just a little bit better.
Hunter T. Baldwin: Dr. Richard Nygard
Dr. Richard Nygard is a man of few words (none, in fact, in the entire show). But just like Nygard, Baldwin is single-handedly responsible for keeping the entire shift afloat — not only with unparalleled second-round edits, but also plenty of free therapy as well.
Annie Harrigan: Tom Haverford
“Pawnee is the opposite of hip. People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana. I don’t have the heart to tell them what’s gonna happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.”
In Season Five episode four, Tom Haverford live tweets himself getting into a car accident — a level of Twitter devotion that could only be matched by Harrigan. But powered by her Twitter savvy, Harrigan’s artistic taste is perennially two steps ahead of the rest of the Arts Board.
Lanz Aaron G. Tan: Ron Swanson
"Is Star Wars the one with the little wizard boy?"
If Tan grew a moustache, the two would be carbon copies. Known for his stubbornness, iron fist, and complete lack of mainstream pop culture knowledge, Tan’s love for Martin Scorcese might only be matched by Ron’s love of Lagavulin whiskey.
Connor S. Dowd and Amelia F. Roth-Dishy: Jean-Ralphio and Mona-Lisa Saperstein
“Did someone call for a party zoo?”
“Meow meow meow meow.”
Personality-wise, this one is a bit of a stretch, but much like the Sapersteins, these Co-Blog execs are an absolutely iconic duo — and, indeed, are the life of any Crimson Arts party.
Cassandra Luca: Donna Meagle
“I’m live-Tweeting this dumbass conversation.” 
The queen of the Books section, Luca is most definitely a cat, not a dog (a la Season Six episode eight). And what better title for a novel about productivity culture is there than “treat yo’ self”?
Samantha J O’Connell: Ann Perkins
Leslie: “Ann, you poetic, noble land mermaid.”
In the sea of chaotic, weird, and insufferable personalities on Crimson Arts (myself, most of all), O’Connell is the lone voice of normalcy (I would not be surprised if she glances at the camera every time someone speaks at Arts meetings), and not even the dozens of compliments Leslie lavishes onto Ann over the course of the series could capture the appreciation she deserves
Jack M. Schroeder: Mark Brendanawicz
“Recently, I had been thinking about maybe, um, leaving this job.”
Our beloved former Campus exec was both a strong writer and steadfast friend. But as we left behind the physical campus, Schroeder faded away as well — going the way of Mark Brendanawicz at the end of Season Two.
— Incoming Arts Chair Kalos K. Chu has never seen an animated film in his life, and, indeed, considers “Frozen 2” to be one of the great cultural atrocities of this century. While we’re at it, he has definitely not rewatched “Parks and Recreation” three times in the past few months, and thinks that Lanz Aaron G. Tan has wonderful taste in film. Anyone wishing to dispute these facts may reach out to him at kalos.chu@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all know the guy who — in identifying too closely with Joseph Gordon Levitt’s character in “(500) Days of Summer” — has decided that The Smiths, with all their nihilistic charm, are the greatest band of all time (bonus points if he’s also somehow still a fan of Morrissey as an individual). He’s usually the same guy who idolizes Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort, while also wishing he could find his own Ramona Flowers to fix his life for him.
In almost all cases, the straight man who fits the above description is also an avid listener of “male manipulator music.” A term which gained popularity on Tik Tok, male manipulator music refers to a subgenre of music enjoyed by manipulative men before ghosting and/or gaslighting you.
While the most common examples of it include The Smiths, XXXTentacion, and absolutely any Soundcloud rapper, there are plenty other commonly overlooked artists who can still serve as a red flag on a straight white man’s playlist.
As someone who is unfortunately attracted to straight men, I have taken it upon myself to do the work of weeding out questionable tastes in music so that you don’t have to.
Oh, and if any of these artists are their Tinder anthem? Run.
Phoebe Bridgers
I love “Punisher” as much as the next sad girl rock fan, but a straight white man knowing all the words to “Savior Complex” can be dangerous. The type of guy who uses his knowledge of Bridgers’s music as a tool to impress you won’t hesitate to use the raw emotions Bridgers provides to manipulate you somehow — and probably won’t even be self-aware enough to notice. Now that I think about it, this also applies to any boys who listen to Mitski or Soccer Mommy. I don’t make the rules.
Neutral Milk Hotel
Like Bridgers, Neutral Milk Hotel is for guys who want to pretend they’re in touch with their feelings. In reality, they’ll actually just use the words from “In The Aeroplane Over the Sea” to break up with you because they can’t come up with anything else that’s as sentimental. Remember in “Perks of Being a Wallflower” when NMH-superfan and protagonist Charlie is told to kiss the prettiest girl in the room and kisses Emma Watson’s character instead of his date? Yeah.
Radiohead
Radiohead receives a sizable amount of their profit from pretentious guys who are incapable of showing any affection whatsoever. The straight white man who stans Radiohead will make you listen to “The Bends” for hours on end while trying to convince you that he and Thom Yorke have your best interest at heart. He’ll also gaslight you into believing that guitarist Jonny Greenwood doesn’t shred, even though you know he’s wrong. Has he not heard “Electioneering” or “Paranoid Android”?!
Tame Impala
Did you know Tame Impala was only one person? If you find yourself in a conversation with a white boy who has made the artist his key personality trait, he won’t let you forget that.
Red Hot Chilli Peppers
For some reason, Anthony Kiedis’s crude lyrics and Flea’s funky slap bass lines serve as the formative soundtrack for guys who want to convince themselves they’re laid back and desirable. Really, that couldn’t be further from the truth — especially if he’s fratty. I’m looking at you, [redacted].
Mac DeMarco
For most straight white men, DeMarco is the gateway drug to “indie” music. He’ll listen to “Salad Days” once and be convinced that his music taste is unique enough to brag about. And he will brag about it, all while simultaneously gatekeeping an artist with five million listeners on Spotify.
Kanye West
If the guy says he likes West’s music for the production and artistry of it but really only listens to the self-professed “greatest artist of all time” because he wishes he were Yeezus himself, that’s a problem.
Weezer
Sorry, Rivers Cuomo ‘06. This one needs no explanation.
—If you, a straight male, consider any of these artists a defining personality trait, please do not contact incoming culture exec Sofia Andrade at sofia.andrade@thecrimson.com.

A spectre is haunting the American Film Institute’s Top 100 rankings: The spectre of a shockingly slept-on masterpiece of genre filmmaking that delivered cutting social commentary, ingenious dialogue, and nuanced characters navigating the intricacies of friendship and romance. Am I referring to the seminal works “Fargo,” “Chinatown,” or one of those Quentin Tarantino faux Westerns? Of course not. I’m thinking of the god-tier high school horror movie “Jennifer’s Body,” penned by Diablo Cody, which has been relegated to the status of “cult classic” when it should be considered a straight-up classic.
Why, you might ask? First of all, nobody does it like Jennifer Check (Megan Fox). She manages to be shockingly mean, insensitive, and nightmarish every second she’s on screen, yet she commands sympathy even in her hellishness because she’s a monster created by men. It’s not Jennifer’s fault she’s “actually evil, not high school evil” — she’s the collateral damage of a bunch of guys who, in their self-absorbed pursuit of greatness, saw her as disposable and ruined her life. It’s a straightforward allegory for the effects of the patriarchy on existing dynamics between young women, in this case Jennifer and her best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried), and Cody and director Karyn Kusama geniously used the horror flick as a vessel. “Jennifer’s Body” is basically a feminist “Frankenstein” — which we know is good because they made us read it in Hum 10.
Beyond the basic premise, though, Jennifer’s blend of confident disregard for others (from her demon side) and extreme insecurity (from her teen girl side) make her a standalone feminist antihero, uninterested in impressing men (like when she’s asked out to the Rocky Horror Picture Show and responds “I don’t like boxing movies”), but constantly undercutting her best friend. She’s literally all-powerful and resilient (#GirlBoss!), and therein fulfills a superficial version of modern feminism — but the movie goes deeper, interrogating her sinister role in perpetuating the very same patriarchy that screwed her over. Anyways, I could really go on about the implications of this film for modern feminism (and I have, to any friends foolish enough to watch it with me), but the point I’m making is that Jennifer’s Body is complex, surprising, and philosophical. What of that is true for “Singin’ in the Rain?” I like Gene Kelly and all, but I think the American Film Institute has room for some rearranging.
Jennifer’s Body should also be in the AFI Top 100 because it delivers one of the most resounding, needed takedowns of male indie musicians in modern memory. There are far too many alt-rock bands that just aren’t that good, and this is the only movie I’ve seen that directly addresses this issue. In that sense, it pioneered the anti-Indie Boy genre and thus earned its place in the cinematic canon.
If none of this compels you, it’s worth noting that “Jennifer’s Body” is also a beautiful film. Gorgeously shot and directed — the color scheme alone would wipe the floor with every aesthetic choice in “Pulp Fiction.” It’s got a campy abandoned pool, a murder-weapon-disappearing waterfall, and that scene where Jennifer smears foundation on her face that spawned a thousand Tumblr gifs — what more could the American Film Institute possibly want?
Sure, “Citizen Kane” is a perfectly good movie. Fine. But, as Jennifer would say, “move-on-dot-org, Needy, it’s over.” It’s “Jennifer’s Body”’s turn now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the field of prestige TV, HBO reigns supreme. The network’s series, from “Chernobyl” to “The Undoing” to “Watchmen,” have captivated audiences and offered an escape in the midst of the pandemic. Chris Salvaterra ‘90, who got his start in film production after studying English at Harvard College, now oversees many of these projects as Senior Vice President for Drama Series, crafting the channel’s slate of shows. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Salvaterra over the phone about his work, the landscape of TV, and his advice to aspiring creatives.
The Harvard Crimson: Could you tell me a little bit about the work you do at HBO, and what that looks like day-to-day?
Chris Salvaterra: I am what you would call a creative executive in programming, so I'm part of the team in Drama Series that evaluates material that comes in (pitches, scripts, etc.) to determine whether we think it's appropriate for HBO. Once we acquire a project, I help to oversee and guide that project through development, production, post production — all the way up until airing
THC: What is your favorite part about working at HBO, and what are you proudest of in your work?
CS: My favorite part of working at HBO is the emphasis on quality. I was in the movie business for a long time... I got out of it because I started to see fewer stories that I was truly interested in being told, and I started to see more and more stories that I was interested in in the television format. To give you an example, I worked on a movie called “Syriana” that, had it been made now, would be, if anything, a miniseries as opposed to a theatrical film, and that just goes to show how the landscape has changed. The thing I'm proudest of that I've worked on at HBO is “Chernobyl.” And if you think about the subject matter of “Chernobyl,” 20 years ago that might have been a theatrical film, but now it's a miniseries. I love the emphasis on quality, and I love working in a television format, because you can just take your time telling the story.
THC: What draws you to a project?
CS: I would say what draws me most to any given project is if there's a sense of intimacy. I have a former boss who used to refer to the power of the intimate moment, and that's what drew me to entertainment in the first place. And that's what I look for in a project; if I feel emotionally connected to a piece of material, then that's really interesting to me. I think another facet of it at HBO is, what is the author, filmmaker or creator trying to say about the world we live in? Or if not trying to say something — because that could easily be sort of reductive — is this piece reflective of what's going on in the world today? If it's, say, “Chernobyl”; that was [set in] the ‘80s, but it was about the power of lies and the tendency of the truth to eventually come out, the betrayal of institutions, and the tendency of fascism to ignore the safety of the people… I felt that Chernobyl said a lot about where we are today in telling a story that's admittedly in the past.
THC: When did your interest in TV and film start, and how did you decide to pursue a career in production?
CS: My interest in TV and film started very early on with, you name it: “Star Wars,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” the John Hughes movies. And in television, “Family Ties” and “Cheers.” “Cheers” remains my favorite show of all time. In college, though, I didn't make the connection; it sounds ridiculous, but it was a much less connected, information-heavy world before the internet. So I didn't make the connection, at least not consciously, that there was an industry that made the television and movies that I love so much. It was a bit of a journey of discovery for me… I did a job at WCVB at the news desk, and it was a good experience, but it was a little too dry... I realized I wanted to tell fictional stories. One day I just decided to kind of pick up a pen and start writing something, and it was as if the heavens opened up... I went to the Office of Career Services, and there was literally a rolodex. There were a couple of cards there of graduates who were working in entertainment, but it was slim pickings. I decided that I was going to go out to California; I wrote for “Let's Go,” the travel guide, to get me out there, and then I slept on a friend's floor for a few months. And it took me a couple of years to get even an assistant job at an agency, and it's been this kind of long, slow marathon journey ever since.
THC: Do you think the pandemic has affected the kinds of shows you're able to produce, or the timeline? And do you think it'll impact the landscape of TV in the next couple of years?
CS: I do think it has; there's no way that it can’t affect the landscape of television. What we've experienced is what every company has experienced — we had to press pause on a huge number of projects. So we have a lot of projects on the runway, and there's some room next year, and then ‘22 and ‘23 [airing schedules] are pretty full... I think in those years, people are going to be like “I can't keep up with everything.” There's going to be a glut of product. The stuff that we’re shooting now, and things that have moved to the front of the line, are things that are more contained … we're doing another version of “In Treatment," which [has a] therapy session in every episode. Mike White's doing a show for us that’s set in a hotel. So we try to use the circumstances as an opportunity to make some things that are achievable.
THC: Do you have any advice for a college student interested in working in TV or film, or anything you wish you had known going into it?
CS: What I wish I had known going into it was advice that I got a long time ago, that I always refer to: It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Especially in these times, these current circumstances, you have to be patient. I think that people should use the resources at their disposal, a la the internet, to watch everything that they possibly can, to read everything that they possibly can. The amazing thing is, you now have PDFs of every script out there — so if you're a writer, if you're an aspiring producer, if you're an aspiring executive, that's all there for you.
I had to get a job at an agency so that I could have access to hundreds of scripts — they would have the script library with piles and piles of scripts — but now it's at your fingertips… And then lastly, approach it as a craft; whatever it is that you want to do in entertainment, you need to develop skill. And the foundation of that skill is storytelling, whether you're creating the story yourself in a certain format, or you're hoping to shape the story as an executive or a producer, or you're sourcing interesting ideas. It's all storytelling.

In January 2020, the Harvard College Open Data Project was constructing its annual survey of the Harvard student body. Lucy Li ’21 and other members of HODP composed some expected questions: How many businesses in Harvard Square will shut down this semester? Who do you think will win the 2020 election? One question, however, might have seemed out of place: Do you think a Harvard student will get COVID-19 before the end of the semester? At the time, the virus was in its early days, circling Wuhan, China — months before Harvard students’ departure from campus.
“It didn’t really seem like such a big deal then,” Li remembers. “We decided that it was maybe not super appropriate to include, given that we didn’t know how bad COVID was. So we didn’t end up having a question about that.”
By the time Li returned to her home in the suburbs of Kansas City, Kansas in March, COVID-19 had become a big deal. She’s been there for the nine months since, taking classes and playing cards with friends over Zoom, all from her purple childhood bedroom. She misses when she could work without the sounds of her brother’s clarinet classes floating in. Not much else penetrates her bubble.
“It’s sort of seemed less real than it did on campus, because this isn’t really a densely populated area,” she says. “I feel like I’m in a little bit of a bubble. And everything’s going on outside of the window.”
As the news of 2020 reaches her, Li filters it through her passion for economics. “I would have thought that most of the interesting findings about the pandemic would have been coming from people who work on public health and biology,” she says. “But there are lots of really interesting research questions that economists have been trying to answer, related to which policies would be the most effective, as well as the obvious economic impacts of the coronavirus.”
Li’s thesis relates closely to the events of 2020, particularly in the context of the election. She’s exploring the ways that social media can exacerbate populist sentiments. Over the summer, she read a paper speculating that social media contributes to populist thought because it “lends itself to stereotyped or emotionally charged messages, because the physical length of the messages has to be shorter.” So she began to explore “how social media use might affect political outcomes, like election outcomes and polarization.”
Li wasn’t always sure she would pursue economics. She entered college planning to study biomedical engineering, then moving to pre-med before declaring Statistics and tacking on Computer Science; after changing her mind once more, she settled on Applied Math and Economics. Despite this wide-ranging path, her pursuits have centered on a constant curiosity: “Why do people make the choices they do, and why do they act and behave the way they do?”
As Li embarks on her last semester, she’s looking forward to going back to campus. “I’m just very happy to have the chance to go back to campus at all,” she says. ‘There was a real risk at one point that I had already been at Harvard for the last time.”

One of the first things Olivia K. Bryant ’21 mentions on our Zoom call is the “jumper” that she’s knitting just below the frame.
“If a class doesn’t require me to write notes, that’'s what I am doing while I am watching,” she jokes. Bryant, a self-declared “homebody,” has spent this semester at her childhood home in Canterbury, a city outside of London.
She’s already completed all of her requirements for her Statistics concentration. She’s been using the extra time to continue her summer internship with a polling company, serve as a teaching fellow for a computer science course, and take electives.
“I feel like I’ve graduated, honestly. I think it’s partly because I’m working, so it kind of feels like I’m sort of semi-graduated,” she says. “I feel like I could completely go off the radar.”
Despite strong Kirkland House connections and gracious professors, Bryant says she feels disconnected from the University.
“Harvard as an institution, I don’t feel very connected to anymore,” she says. “I feel like I have nothing here that reminds me of it. There’s not many other students that are close to me. And all of my stuff is in a warehouse 3,000 miles away: photos and books, and all the things that just remind me of campus.”
Even so, Bryant has tried to appreciate some of the “silver linings” she has found during the pandemic.
“I’ve learned that I am more resilient than I thought,” she says. “It’s also making me realize how many opportunities are out there and how many different paths you can take.”
Before the pandemic, Bryant had planned to find a job near Canterbury, but after spending nearly a year at home, she’s realized she misses living in a city.
“I was kind of anti-moving to London because I’'m not really a city person and very much a country bumpkin,” she says. “[The pandemic] just made me reconsider living in a city and what I want to do when I graduate. I think that’s been a big part, because I’ve spent another year at home, and I’m kind of increasingly ready to leave.”
Living at home this semester has allowed Bryant to save money, both through her jobs and the room and board stipend Harvard provided to students on financial aid who aren’t living on campus. As a result, Bryant has been able to apply for Master’s programs and internships in London that she would not have been able to otherwise.
As the conversation continues, Bryant holds up the black and white jumper she just finished for me to see. “I think I knit four jumpers this summer,” she quips.
When she’s not studying, working, or knitting, Bryant tries to stay social and visit her friends in London. She even met her boyfriend during the pandemic via Bumble, who ironically is from Massachusetts but studies at Oxford — her reverse, she points out.
“I started dating someone in quarantine, which is super exciting, because I always said when I was at Harvard, ‘I know I want to move back to the U.K., so I’m not going to date many people, because I know I want to move back.’”
She adds, sincerely, “I’m pretty aggressively British.”
Despite the opportunity to return to campus in the spring, Bryant thinks it’s best to spend her final semester at home.
“I know myself, and I know that I wouldn’t enjoy going back to campus if it’s not as good as I remember it being,” she says. Bryant says she is very close with her family, and as a first-generation low-income student, she feels like her college experience is ending full circle.
“Literally all my family live in the same city. And it’s a tiny city: My Gran lives up the road, my uncle lives up the road, and no one else in my family has even been to America. And we’re really, really close,” she explains. “I’m the first in my family to go to university. In a way, I think it’s really nice that I’m probably going to finish it off at home with my family, because it’s been a really collective effort.”

P. Winston Michalak ’21 never dreamed he’d spend what was supposed to be his senior year within the walls of his childhood home in Evanston, Ill. But throughout our conversation, he repeatedly insists on how lucky he feels.
Admittedly, he misses spending time with his friends, competing with the club swim team, and seeing the Pfoho dining staff at meals. But he’s quick to give props to his family’s cooking, too, joking that “our ‘dining hall’ — our kitchen — is also great.” The Michalaks have a full house for the holidays, with Winston, his parents, his older sister, and his younger brother.
“I grew up hanging out with my siblings,” Michalak says, “so it’s been easy to not feel so isolated.” He feels fortunate to have his sister and brother home right now, because socializing outside of his household is difficult to do safely, and most of his friends live outside of Evanston anyway. When I ask what he and his family do for fun, Michalak mentions cooking, talking, and watching horror movies.
“Or working together,” he adds on, proceeding to describe how his family members gather to work on separate tasks in the same area, just to enjoy one another’s company. I chuckle when I hear that, thinking of my own family’s antics, and ask him if working from home hasn’t been at all distracting. He laughs and admits,“I definitely felt like productivity took a hit at the beginning. But I think we’ve adjusted to this remote life, so now we’re back at working more effectively.”
Michalak has had plenty of work to do, despite taking time off from school this semester. He currently has a job at Intel, doing data analysis for a team that tests semiconductors to make sure they’re working properly. I’ve already told Michalak I’m an English concentrator, so he graciously explains what a semiconductor is for me — essentially, I learn, it’s a necessary component of “computers, smartphones, and lots of computing technologies.”
Michalak says his decision to take the job rather than enroll this semester might have been different in a world without COVID-19. However, as things are, he feels lucky for the opportunity to do work he enjoys while earning money to alleviate financial pressures at home. He’s also grateful for the extra time to think about his electrical engineering thesis, which he laughingly says is “still very much up in the air.”
Michalak is a research assistant at the Kennedy School’s Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship. On campus, this role meant organizing and running events, but now he helps out virtually by supporting research efforts for team members writing articles or attending talks. When I ask him what time management is like with so many commitments, he says, “Nothing that I’m doing ever feels like a burden. All the work that I’m doing is really interesting and so it never lags.”
Michalak says that one of the things he’s appreciated about remote life has been his ability to attend virtual events while he’s working on something else. “I can be two places at once, which has been really exciting,” he says. Another benefit of isolation at home has been increased intentionality when it comes to staying connected with his college friends. Now that Zoom is the “new normal,” he says, he makes an effort to keep in touch with classmates overseas and all around the United States.
Michalak isn’t sure whether he’ll return to campus next semester, though he longs to see his friends again — it’s undeniable there is no virtual replacement for physical proximity to the people you love. Still, he ends our conversation by reasserting how grateful he is for what this shocking year has held for him. “Many millions of Americans have COVID, and many hundreds of thousands of them have died of COVID,” he says, reminding us both of the world’s strange and terrifying present state. “That is something that my family has not had to deal with, so I consider myself very fortunate.”

During a more typical semester, Avril Saavedra ’21 can usually be found in the “most random places on campus”: playing trumpet with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra in Sanders Theater, running the Quad Grille in Pfoho, producing at WHRB headquarters in Pennypacker, or studying in a dining hall, which she prefers for the buzz and opportunity to encounter friends. (Though she lives in Cabot, Saavedra’s favorite house is Kirkland, “because they make the best grilled cheese — with egg.”)
This fall has been similarly nomadic, but with a different set of spaces: moving once or twice a week between the homes of various family members in Uruguay, where she was born and has spent the semester. Saavedra zoomed me from her aunt’s house in the capital, Montevideo, which has served as her “home base.” Her aunt’s large black cat, Casper, climbed on top of Saavedra’s arm as we began speaking.
Though she was born in Uruguay, Saavedra’s family moved to the U.S. around 2003, and she was undocumented for several years. Growing up in New York City, she was jealous when friends grumbled about extended family gatherings — those grumbles seemed like a privilege. Now, during a time when many Harvard students are physically isolated, Saavedra has been able to reconnect with family members she hasn’t seen since her only other visit to Uruguay five years ago, or even since she left as a young child. The pandemic has not been nearly as devastating in Uruguay as it has to the U.S., affording her the flexibility to see family and take trips with them to various natural and national landmarks, from the highest point in Uruguay to an amethyst quarry.
“I have gotten to just go to the camps and meet the cows and explore,” she says, “and that is something I enjoy, and getting to do that with my family is not something I ever really expected to do.” (Uruguay has 12 million cows and three million people, which is “very noticeable,” she says —the resulting meat-centered diet has compromised her vegetarianism.)
Most meaningful for her has been seeing and becoming a part of many family members’ daily lives, which her last visit was too brief to allow. Her aunt, who owns a bakery, has taught her to bake some of the national desserts, such as alfajores: a center of dulce de leche between two buttery cookies and drenched in chocolate or dusted with powdered sugar (which are Saavedra’s favorites from among dozens of variations). One day, she hopes to open a bakery-library.
“This time I feel like I’m leaving and actually know my family,” she says. “And that’s really, really meaningful.”
Balancing time between family and class can be difficult at times. “I’m only there for a concentrated amount of time, and then I feel like I have to be there with them because I haven’'t seen them in either five or 15 years,” Saavedra says. “It’s very hard to then be like, ‘Sorry, I have to go to class.’” She dropped a computer science course for this reason. “It feels like I am being disrespectful, and it’s also just, I want to be around my family, I want to get to know them.”
Despite the strain on regular coursework, being in Uruguay has helped her thesis tremendously. A Comparative Literature concentrator, Saavedra is translating the collected poems of Cristina Peri Rossi, an Uruguayan writer who fled to Spain in 1972 facing military repression for her transgressive topics. She’s been able to find first-edition copies of Rossi’s works, dive into the Uruguayan literary tradition, and talk to close contacts of Rossi. “If I had been on campus and been remote, in that sense, from the place that I was studying,” Saavedra says, “I think my thesis would not be nearly as full and I would not have had such a life-changing experience in the writing of it.”
Saavedra still wishes she could have spent the semester on campus. She misses “getting to plan out every single bit of time to spend as much time as possible with all of the people that I love”: baking for PAF dinners, hosting tea parties with the dozens of mugs and types of tea she kept in her suite, and playing in the orchestra. “I’m probably never going to get to play in an orchestra again, and I didn’t even realize that it was my last concert when it was my last concert,” she says. “And that’s really upsetting, because HRO was my first family on campus.”
After a childhood spent frequently moving and commuting multiple hours to high school, Saavedra “expected college would be the first time I had sort of a very stable life for four years, and was sort of shocked that it was disrupted,” she says. The spring semester, if she is on campus, will not be the same: no orchestra, no Grille. “It will be four months of sort of normal life,” Saavedra predicts, “and then into the complete unexpectedness that is the rest of time.”

Natalie J. Gale ’21 spent the first half of her studio art class training to handle equipment that she never got the chance to use. Instead, she found herself constructing a soldering workshop in her garage to produce the stained glass art she had hoped to create on campus.
A joint concentrator in History and Literature and Art, Film, and Visual Studies, Gale feels campus’s absence through the artistic spaces she often occupied. “I really miss this one room in the Carpenter Center where you can just camp out for 12 hours and just print photos,” she says.
In March, Gale swapped Dunster House for her home in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, a small town outside of Portland. And although the swift goodbyes forced by a truncated semester were somber, returning home grounded her during “a very turbulent moment.”
“I think that I am really lucky that I am really rooted in my home,” she says.
Having stayed home to work in Portland during the previous summer, Gale planned to pursue opportunities farther from home this year. The early months of the pandemic, however, quickly revealed that the positions she applied for in New York and Florence, Italy were out of the question.
“I was like, ‘Oh, I made a poor decision,’” she recalls, laughing. “I really did pick the two places where it was very clear early on that [my jobs] wouldn’t be continuing.”
Her full-time choices dashed, Gale turned to local pursuits, cobbling together a collection of part-time jobs. She rattles off a string of projects: participating in the Institute of Politics’s “COVID-19 Global Learning Landscape” research initiative as co-chair of the education policy team, continuing work on a Boston Center for the Arts exhibition (she’s been involved since January), building websites for local businesses, and performing digital work for the Somali Bantu Community Association, which she says recently hit its $367,000 fundraising goal — allowing it to acquire a 104-acre farm in Maine for Somali Bantu farmers.
Recounting her unorthodox summer, she remarks that much of her work felt like a continuation of her work from the previous summer and even high school: “It was just funny to see the way that through lines emerged from things that I’ve done before in Maine that just kind of fell back into place when I went back to Maine.”
For the fall, however, Gale chose to leave her home state, settling in a house in Keene, N.H. with friends. After considering taking time off, she ultimately decided to enroll, hoping to keep her social community “as intact as possible” while also stating that she “didn’t want to delay being done with college.”
“Not in a shady way,” she reassures me. “I just think that I am really excited for all the wonderful things that can happen after graduation. And it felt like it was resting on assumptions about the timeline of the pandemic to make a decision that would delay that.”
But while her weekdays are filled with thesis meetings, hours of intensive German, kickboxing, and even stargazing for her astronomy class, the weekends are reserved for trips to rural New England to gather material for her AFVS thesis. Before the pandemic, Gale proposed a photography thesis that involved photographing spaces that were important to her queer community in Cambridge — a now-impossible project. But while her work now spans across states, its theme remains constant: what family and home look like for queer communities.
Gale is now photographing queer households in rural areas, a “seemingly inaccessible, but sometimes really idealized and romanticized thing, for queer people in particular,” she says. The pandemic has drawn more younger queer people into rural locations, she says. Gale hopes to capture the state of these communities with her work.
“It’s amazing that I’ve been able to find this way of photographing that is still COVID-safe,” she says. “It’s all outdoors, we’re going to farms and forests and beaches, and just outdoor spaces that are important to these people in this moment of their lives.”
In some cases, however, such continuity was more difficult. Gale says it was hard to adjust to the “new reality” that came with the semester’s end: saying goodbye to friends for possibly the last time, taking classes without the campus life that was “so vibrant.”
Her work in mental health support and peer counseling has also taken a hit: “[I have] to grapple with this thing, which is the most meaningful thing in my life, being really hard to do remotely,” she says. Although peer counseling groups have adjusted to the pandemic and she can now provide more care than she could in the pandemic’s earlier months, she still feels the disturbances.
“Just knowing that so many people were and are struggling, and not being able to provide care in the way that I best know how, and love to, was super hard,” she says.
When I ask her about themes or ideas that persisted through her pandemic experience, Gale emphasizes the idea of care.
“I think that for me, the thing that comes to mind is, ‘what are the ways that we can best take care of each other right now?’” she asks. “[I’m just] trying to figure out how we can really keep the love going from a very faraway distance.”

Catherine H. Ho’s ’21 college experience has come full circle — she’s back in her childhood home in Louisville, Ky., feeling slightly coddled by her parents as an only child and “reverting to high school dynamics” over time. But Ho says she’ll be graduating from Harvard a very different person compared to her freshman self.
“I was such a hardcore pre-med,” she laughs. Ho had planned to apply to medical school in her senior year and continue on directly after graduating.
Her trajectory changed during the fall of her sophomore year, when Ho testified in defense of race-conscious admissions in the Harvard affirmative action lawsuit. When she took to the stand, she cited the importance of her Vietnamese heritage in her identity. She spoke to lawyers, learned what Asian American studies was, and took her first Ethnicity, Migration, Rights class that semester.
By now, Ho has taken almost as many classes for her EMR secondary as she has for her Neuroscience concentration. “[EMR] classes have really asked me to consider what I want the institution I exist in to be,” she says. Her growing awareness of how power dynamics play out at Harvard — “who gets valued, who doesn’t get valued” — has guided her work with the Asian American Womxn’s Association, the Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies, and the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition.
What science and social justice share, Ho says, is the feeling that she can bring her full self to both of these environments, with mentors that understand the challenges of being an FGLI student. “I’m not just there in one capacity,” she says. “I’m not just there as an undergrad thesising, but I’m also a person who has interests, who my mentors care about. In class I’m not just a student, but I’m also a person with a lived set of experiences that are seen as valuable.”
In the past, Ho could be found trudging through the snow in Quincy courtyard on her way to Leverett House or working on her thesis about memory retrieval and problem solving on the eighth floor of William James. These days, she wakes up at a “quite bad” hour in the late morning and reads through her notifications from the Boston Globe, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. After her classes, she will “decompress for half an hour by reading more news,” then FaceTime her friends or wrangle hyperactive elementary school students on Zoom as part of the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment program. Even if she doesn’t manage to get through the curriculum she planned for the kids, she’s grateful to still be a source of regularity and support in their lives.
“On campus, my Google Calendar was very full, but with quarantine and with the heightened experience that is 2020, I’m proud that I’ve been able to be more flexible with myself,” Ho says. She has been cooking or baking one new recipe each week since quarantine began, stretching her culinary horizons with milk bread rolls, lemon Greek yogurt cake, and an attempt to recreate the HUDS sweet potato casserole — “I DMed them for the recipe and they never responded,” she says.
Returning home has also given Ho the opportunity to translate her politicization from Boston and Cambridge back to her hometown. The shooting of Breonna Taylor and the subsequent protests in Louisville have led her to think more deeply about the dangers of performative activism and how she approaches her work as an ally.
“Racial triangulation tells us that we’re all connected,” Ho says, “but how do I really think through the complicated entanglements of what that means? How can I bring myself to this space in the most respectful way while still really being involved?”
Ho has already been accepted to Harvard Law School through the Junior Deferral Program. She plans to spend her two deferral years in an Asian American Studies or American Studies master’s program, and she hopes to eventually become an immigration lawyer or a community lawyer. Though college has taught her that Harvard is not the perfect institution she imagined as a freshman, she is eager to return for law school to continue to advocate for diversity and inclusion at the University.
“My relationship to and gratitude to Harvard is for what it can hold in the future,” she says.

Akanksha D. Sah ’21 first learned the College was sending students home while at her mother’s apartment in Boston, sick with the flu. In the span of a few days, she had to pack her bags, say goodbye to her friends — many of whom were rushing to catch trains and flights — and, as president of Harvard Student Agencies, find a way to sustain the 12 businesses the non-profit runs in Harvard Square.
Harvard Student Agencies typically employs more than 600 Harvard students in tasks ranging from laundry delivery to tutoring. In March, the organization had no choice but to shut down its in-person operations and adapt its business model. With the help of a government grant, it continued to pay employees who relied on its wages.
“It was a really stressful time, but also one that restored my faith in humanity,” Sah recalls. “My team was so freaking understanding. Every single [person] was so gracious and patient and kind and supportive. We made it through this year purely because of them.”
Sah, an inactive Crimson editorial editor, cannot help but smile and gesticulate wildly as she talks about HSA. Ever since she joined the organization as a freshman, she’s been hooked; in it she says she found a “welcoming community” for people who “like to do things.”
“Nowhere else [in college] have I found I have been able to have so much impact, ” she explains.
Her first year, she managed client relationships for Campus Insights, a market research firm, closing deals worth thousands of dollars. “I came into college an 18 year old schmuck who knew nothing about the world [but was] sitting there, pitching to executives at Google, GoFundMe, Venmo, Airbnb,” she recalls. During her second year, she helped run The Academies, a summer enrichment program for high schoolers.
Sah credits HSA with her growth as a leader. “Throughout these three years, I’ve learned so much about myself: what I like in a team, what good leadership means, how you [can] use seemingly purely business practices to then create social good,” she says. “These are not things I could have learned anywhere else.”
For Sah, HSA is inextricable from her college experience. It is thanks to her salary as president, for instance, that she is able to afford her own apartment near the Square this semester. What she typically saves she now spends on rent and groceries. Though perhaps not ideal, she elected to live alone because her mother’s apartment could not accommodate both her and her brother. She says her experience has often been lonely and difficult — she’s never missed HUDS more — but Sah is grateful she can still visit her family on the weekends. If anything, she feels “quite lucky” for her stable living situation.
“It only sucks in a very ‘first world problems’ sort of way,” she says with a laugh..
Outside her work with HSA, Sah is concentrating in philosophy with a secondary in psychology — fields she hopes will guide a future career in child advocacy.
Since she was young, Sah has been interested in correcting what she dubs “inefficiencies” in the adoption and foster care systems. “The way bureaucracy works, children stay in the system for a long time,” she explains. “But if you spend five years being tossed around from foster home to foster home, that’s five years of childhood gone that you can’t get back.”
Sah believes children are an “overlooked demographic” in advocacy. “A lot of times it’s taken for granted that their parents are their advocates,” she says. “But sometimes their parents aren’t and sometimes [they are] but don’t have the power to make a difference in their children’s lives.”
Sah hopes to work at a government agency or non-profit where she can enact lasting change in these systems. She imagines her backgrounds in philosophy and developmental psychology will inform the “life-changing decisions” she might make on a daily basis.
“If I can do anything in my power to change things, I’d be super happy,” she says. “If you change one kid’s life, to you, it’s just one random kid. But for them, it’s their entire life.”
She is currently writing a thesis on how to restructure classrooms to best prop up students from disadvantaged backgrounds — work she hopes to apply directly to her post-graduate job. She’ll be working at a firm opening up a boarding school for orphans.
Sah feels her classes and thesis work have translated well to remote learning. “As a philosophy concentrator, my ‘research’ is simply sitting and having a big think,” she jokes. Next semester, she plans on continuing this work from the privacy of her apartment.
Sah won’t be returning to campus in the spring. She’d like to continue seeing her family each week, and she sees it as her responsibility to protect them — as well her classmates — from potential exposure to the virus. “Obviously, it is not as fun to live by yourself, especially in your last semester of college,” she says. “But everyone I care about is healthy, and that’s the most important thing.”

After transferring from her public school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to a private British school, Jia Y. Lim ’21 had some catching up to do with her English skills. Her public school hadn’t emphasized it; learning was a struggle, and initially her grades were poor.
She remembers sitting at her desk at age 10, frustrated after a disappointing test, when her teacher approached her. “It doesn’t matter what you got,” they said. “What matters most is how far you can go from here,” she recalls.
That moment “placed in context, the value of learning — where it isn’t all based on what you got at the end,” Lim says. She still remembers being “flabbergasted” at the teacher’s kindness. “In terms of the numbers and the grades, it’s about what you got from it, how you can use that knowledge.”
An economics concentrator in Quincy House working on a secondary in philosophy, Lim still centers her teacher’s advice in her learning today.
Lim spent this summer working with Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund, helping to build a strategic national stockpile of supplies in case of a natural disaster. She learned “a ton about how difficult it is to design, execute, and plan for national disaster events.” 2020, she remarks, could be described as the year of the “stockpile.”
Though her work, she gained a new appreciation for frontline workers, government officials, and volunteers. She learned to value the small steps each person can take that can “alleviate the harm that can accrue to a large number of people” during a pandemic. Every person who wears a mask has an “exponential” effect on the people around them, she says, adding, “you have to be super optimistic to be in this line of work.”
After her summer back home, Lim returned to what she describes as a more mundane life in Cambridge. Her days now mostly consist of “waking up, taking walks, opening Zoom, attending class, doing online work, submitting it, taking more walks.”
Life in Malaysia is more interesting, she remarks. “In America, you guys have Amazon,” Lim says The lack of on-demand services in her home country meant she and her family had to plan when and how often they went grocery shopping to limit potential exposure to the virus.
No longer shouldering the tremendous responsibility of planning her family’s grocery trips or securing life-saving supplies for her country, Cambridge’s quiet, snow-covered neighborhoods are, by comparison, dull.
“If you feel safe, you don’t exactly ever need to plan,” she says.
Lim took time off her sophomore year to teach in Mongolia and explore her personal interests, so she still has some time left until she graduates. Asked about her post-graduation plans, she admits she has no concrete ones — only to continue learning for learning’s sake.

The first time I spoke with Tauheed Z. Islam ’21 was this past April — over the phone, not long after we all returned home for quarantine. We talked about a lot of things for an article I was writing at the time, most quite serious. But one thing we didn’t talk about was the picture he sent me after the interview. In it, he’s walking around his neighborhood with a cat strapped to his chest like a baby. So this time, I ask him about it.
“His name is Tobi, short for Tobias, and he is a very, very important part of my life,” Islam says, amused. He shares Tobi with his girlfriend of seven years, and they often walk around his neighborhood pushing the cat in a stroller.
“We look like we’re husband and wife,” he jokes. “And then people will look in [the stroller] and you can see their faces. They’re like, ‘What the heck? That’s a cat, not a baby.’”
For Islam, spending time with his girlfriend (and his cat) is a silver lining of the pandemic. The high school sweethearts are usually in a long-distance relationship, but now that they’re both back in their hometown of Lilburn, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, they see each other much more often.
Much has changed throughout the world since my first conversation with Islam in April — President-elect Joe Biden carried the state of Georgia in November’s election, for example, which makes Islam very happy. But not much has changed about his immediate living situation. Much like this past spring, Islam is partaking in online school, living with his family, and working hard to make ends meet. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on his parents’ jobs, and obtaining enough unemployment benefits has been a constant struggle.
“When we last spoke, it was complicated trying to get the benefits. And then luckily we got the benefits, they came, and then now they’ve run out. It’s like we did a full 180,” Islam says. “It’s kind of ironic, but we’re hanging in there.”
Islam often checks in on his extended family as well, who immigrated to the area from Bangladesh a few years ago. “Not only are they getting used to a new country, but they’re getting used to a new country in a completely unprecedented year where a bunch of crazy shit is happening,” he explains. “I want to make sure they’re okay.”
Islam emphasizes that family is a partiuclarly important priority for him and for many other first-generation and low-income students at the moment.
“You’re with a family where no one has been to college before; they don’t know what you’re going through right now for school. And also they have their own needs, and they have their own struggles — obviously, being from low-income backgrounds — and you might have to help with that,” he says. “For most first-gen low-income students, family has absolutely been top of mind. And I am no exception.”
The past few weeks have been especially difficult for Islam, because his father contracted the coronavirus. Islam stayed with a friend while his father quarantined, and both he and his father have now tested negative. Nonetheless, the experience was jarring and all-consuming. It was very difficult for Islam to focus on virtual school during those weeks.
“The reason we’re all virtual, the reason we’re doing this, is because of this pandemic. And so then I have this intimate case of my dad being a victim of it, and it’s just so scary,” he says. “I was scared for his life. I thought I might lose my dad.”
Although Harvard is allowing seniors back on campus next semester, Islam hasn’t decided if he will return — he thinks it might be best for his family if he stays in Georgia. He feels his presence provides a “strong support network” for his younger cousins and siblings, and since he stayed at home this semester, he received a $5,000 room and board stipend from the University, as well as scholarship money. The extra money made a difference for his family, he says, and if he returns to campus, he worries they might not receive it again.
Despite devoting so much time to his family, Islam has accomplished many personal goals this semester. In the time he was not teaching his cousins to drive or helping his brother with online middle school, he completed his senior fall as a Government concentrator with a secondary in Theater, Dance, and Media, interned at a political consulting firm, and campaigned in Georgia. On election day, he oversaw a whole polling place as an election judge, and spent days counting votes.
“A time like this requires sacrifices,” he says. “I am proud to say I’ve made the most of what I could have this semester.”

Stephen M. Casper ’21 smiles for a Zoom screenshot while Trevor, his Madagascar hissing cockroach, crawls across his left cheek. Despite the species name, Trevor stays quiet — he’s pretty docile in the wintertime, explains Casper, who has kept pet cockroaches in his dorm room since he was a freshman.
Over the summer in 2018, Casper was working on a bioinformatics project under the Church Lab and living in Winthrop House when two of his cockroaches mated. Overwhelmed with 30 newborn cockroaches, Casper wanted to do some “circle of life stuff” and feed them to a lizard, so he took to the Pforzheimer House mailing list and asked if anyone could temporarily loan him a lizard. “But I think I typed that email in a pretty ambiguous way because people started asking me if I found the lizard,” Casper recalls. “Someone in my hall was like, ‘You better find that lizard. I really hate lizards,’ and I was like, “No, I just need a lizard.’”
Spared the “circle of life stuff,” Trevor now enjoys his temporary home in Idaho Falls, Idaho, where Casper grew up. A statistics concentrator who’s “for all intents and purposes a [computer science] person,” Casper’s academic tasks mostly consist of coding and doing math. Switching to virtual learning wasn’t too difficult, he tells me.
Casper studies applications of machine learning involving AI safety, and his senior thesis focuses on a type of threat toward reinforcement learning systems that could be relevant for self-driving cars. Next year, Casper hopes he’ll be in graduate school, but if that doesn’t work out, he’ll take a machine learning engineering job for a few years. In the long term, he wants to pursue a career publishing papers involving machine learning, either in academia or for a nonprofit organization. He also plans on working within a subgroup of the machine learning research community on preventing the “artificial intelligence apocalypse,” which he says he’s “totally into, but not in a creepy death cult way.”
At the moment, Casper isn’t too worried about his thesis or the apocalypse — he’s been writing deep learning papers and blog posts for the past few years. Some of his projects on neural networks and adversarial policies can be found on his website, stephencasper.com, below an introduction that includes a form for “anonymous, constructive feedback about how I can be a better or more effective person.”
This quirky addition to such a professional page might have something to do with Casper’s dedication to effective altruism, “the idea that we should employ evidence in philanthropy to build a better world,” according to the Harvard College Effective Altruism Club website. As a board member of the club, Casper founded, chaired, and designed curriculum for the Arete Fellowship program, which over 25 Effective Altruism university groups have since adopted. “I’m willing to be a walking commercial for the EA Club,” Casper says with a laugh, emphasizing that his involvement in the movement won’t stop after graduation.
When he’s not parenting cockroaches, preventing the AI apocalypse, or becoming a more effective person, Casper spends his spare time learning about witchcraft. For the past few months, he’s been exploring “witchy YouTube channels and podcasts” and occasionally pretending to be a witch on Reddit threads. “Between paganism and Wicca and just independent people practicing witchcraft, there are lots of witches who just do many different things,” he says, as I scour my Etsy purchase history to send him a link to an obsidian crystal necklace I bought.
COVID-19 regulations permitting, Casper is itching to attend coven meetings in Boston with a few of his roommates in the spring. They’ll wear eyeliner and paint their faces, he tells me without further explanation, and join one of the open-invite covens that they’ve already located through Facebook groups. “I’m interested in it ethnographically, but I also think that hanging around witches in Boston just seems fun as hell, right?” he says.
There’s one witchcraft practice that particularly intrigues Casper: making an altar. Even though he’s not superstitious, he loves the concept of arranging witchy things on a small table. Plus, he thinks an altar would complement his “goblin-y aesthetic” and fuel his habit of collecting little objects. Back at school, he kept a jar of buttons, paper clips, screws, pins, and pieces of washers. He pasted playing cards, magazine clippings, and postcards on the walls of his dorm room. Once, he took a book of poetry from the Pforzheimer Library and cut out a bunch of poems.
He loves the meaninglessness of the little things he acquires. “It’s for the same reason that a crow loves a piece of tinfoil: because it’s just a thing that’s interesting-looking,” he says. “That’s why I like to paste shit all over my room.” His trinket collection feeds a curiosity that exists just for the sake of itself, the same kind of pure fascination that lands someone in a coven meeting or with dozens of baby cockroaches.
But Casper’s propensity for collecting discarded items also speaks to his ability to notice them in the first place. At the end of our conversation, I ask him what he’s going to miss most about Harvard. His answer started with what I expected — his roommates and the Effective Altruism Club — but then he thought for a moment. “I’ll miss the Adams tunnels,” he remarks. “I’ll miss walking past that vent that blows warm air next to Canaday in the winter.”

In July, Nicole S. Moulia ’21 and her family moved into a house with three dogs and four people. She has only one dog of her own — the other two, pitbulls, belong to her family’s new landlord, a man Moulia’s father had known before they came to North Miami Beach, Fl. He had asked them to care for the dogs in exchange for cheaper rent.
Moulia has no one single childhood bedroom; she’s only lived in this one since the summer. She says it would take two hours to name all of the comic book superheroes and anime characters on the posters that cover every inch of its walls.
When I first ask about them, Moulia laughs. “Those are my sister’s!” she insists. But the truth soon prevails. “Well, some of them are mine,” she admits.
Moulia and her sister have shared a bedroom for as long as she can remember: in all of her family’s old houses in Boca Raton, Fl., where they’d lived for 13 years before moving suddenly this summer to North Miami Beach, and even earlier, in Milford, Bridgeport, and the other Connecticut towns where Moulia spent the early years of her childhood but whose names she cannot remember.
Until November, Moulia, who studies psychology because she likes it — and because she’s always known she’ll go to law school eventually anyway — was living in a bedroom of her own in the Leverett House towers. On Harvard’s campus for the fall semester, Moulia went comic book shopping with her friends, applied to law school, and appreciated the comfort of having her own room.
Before the pandemic, Moulia and her sister often attended comic conventions together — one of the pros of South Florida, she tells me, is that there are excellent cons. They would start their costumes the night prior to the convention and work until the very last moment, stopping only when sleep overtook them at last. Moulia has attended conventions as Loki, the stringy-haired villain played by Tom Hiddleston in “Thor,” as Kassandra, from the video game “Assassin's Creed Odyssey,” and as Izzy, protagonist of the TV show “Shadowhunters.”
In another life, one where Moulia was not intent on practicing immigration law and felt obliged to no one but herself, she’d write her own science fiction and fantasy. But Moulia is intent: She’s going to become an immigration lawyer, a calling she says has come to eclipse all others in the past years due to “a mounting frustration with the system that I went through and I know others are experiencing, too.”
Moulia moved from Uruguay to Connecticut with her family when she was two years old. She didn’t realize she and her family were undocumented until she reached middle school. In middle school, she began to ask to join sports teams and wonder why her mother didn’t drive. Still, despite the limitations posed by her immigration status, she thrived in school. “Academics were one thing you didn’t need a social security number for,” she recalls.
When she was a junior in high school, Moulia received relief status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She became a citizen just before her graduation. Now, as she prepares for law school interviews, Moulia volunteers at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic and works part-time at a south Florida immigration law office.
At Harvard, Moulia holds many titles. She concentrates in Psychology with a secondary in Ethnicity, Migration,Rights. She’s a veteran Model UN committee director, a devoted staffer of the Small Claims Advisory Service, and an Institute of Politics citizenship tutor (her tutee of three years is about to submit his application, Moulia notes with pride). But Moulia’s great claim to fame — recently bestowed upon her by Professor Stephanie Burt in GENED 1165: “Superheroes and Power” — is the designation of “class expert on all things Marvel Atlantis.”
Now home in Florida, between work and school, Moulia walks the three dogs, cooks her sister’s admittedly unusual favorite lunch — pasta with scrambled eggs and broccoli — and cleans the house. She explains that her mother “cleans for a living, so I don’t want to make her clean at home.”
Before the pandemic, Moulia’s family made a point of going to the theme parks of central Florida each year. Their favorite park is Universal’s Islands of Adventure, and their favorite rides are the ones that give the most thrill. Despite Moulia’s fear of heights, she and her family always ride the biggest rollercoasters with the steepest drops first.
And during the car ride home, Moulia is always in charge of the music. Last year, driving back to Boca Raton at midnight, after her sister had fallen asleep over her Denny’s pancakes, the car’s occupants bolted awake to sing “Balada Del Diablo y La Muerte," executing each lyric perfectly, as always.
Moulia wants this to happen again soon. But as long as it cannot, she would like to be glad for what she has right now. “I’m someone who is really focused on the future,” Moulia says. “In my family, it’s always like me and my dad are very similar,we’re very stressed out, and my sister and my mom are very free-spirited,” she says. “I’ve been trying to be more like my sister and my mom.”

Christie A. Jackson ’21 answers with no hesitation when I ask her what her favorite color is. “I love yellow,” she says, as she pinches the fabric of her turtleneck, pulling it toward the camera as proof. Even through a computer screen, Jackson exudes a positivity and confidence that can best be described as sunny.
Jackson has been living off-campus in Cambridge since June. Before that, she spent several months in Detroit, Mich., her hometown, after leaving campus in March. When I ask how the pandemic affected her life at the time, she pauses. “That’s a complicated question,” she says.
Detroit wasn’t the easiest place to return to during those intervening months, she says. By the end of March, Michigan ranked third in the country for coronavirus cases, with 80 percent of those cases occurring in the Detroit metro area. “I saw a lot of friends who were impacted by COVID-19,” she says. “I have lost a lot of mentors.” Later in the summer, Detroit became a site of widespread protest after the murder of George Floyd.
Jackson is a part of a small cohort of students from Detroit at Harvard — which includes one other student from her high school and a few from another Detroit public school. “We have our small rivalry about which high school is better,” she jokes. Coming to college was a difficult but “enlightening” transition, Jackson explains, as she saw firsthand just how “full of wealth and privilege” Harvard was. “I think that those two experiences definitely showed me a fuller picture of what America looks like,” she says.
Growing up in Detroit shaped her passions and career aspirations. “I’ve personally witnessed and seen how the criminal justice system, how domestic violence, just tears apart lives,” she says. “I think that it’s so important for me to bring awareness to that in a space like Harvard where other students, students like me will go on to be leaders in this country.”
On campus, Jackson serves as Co-President of Harvard College Project for Justice, an organization that brings awareness to issues of criminal justice reform. She also interns at the Harvard College Women’s Center, where she helps organize women’s groups on campus around joint initiatives, including a recent campaign to make HUHS services more accessible to women and LGBTQ+ people. Seeking to merge her interests, Jackson studies Philosophy with a secondary in Women and Gender Studies.
Though Jackson has been an activist throughout her time at Harvard, the COVID-19 pandemic has reignited her passion for organizing. The mass mobilization of grassroots organizations and the newfound engagement of previously apolitical people in the wake of Floyd’s death has given her hope that real systemic change is on the horizon. “People are beginning to listen to people like me, and I think that’s given me hope in going after my purpose, that it’s worthwhile to advocate for social justice issues,” she says.
The pandemic has also been a time of reflection and reevaluation for Jackson, who is considering post-graduate career options. She previously aspired to become a lawyer — the “safe” track, she says — but is now doubly motivated to pursue grassroots organizing, despite its unpredictability. “This pandemic has shown me that it’s worth taking that risk to do what I’m passionate about,” Jackson says.
Living in Cambridge for around seven months, Jackson has found time to revisit long-dormant passions from her youth — namely, creative writing. Though she started writing stories at age six, writing as a creative outlet was pushed aside by papers she had to draft during her time on-campus. Now, she finds herself writing “a lot,” and recently began a new novel. She’s never published her writing before, but when I bring it up, she lights up with possibility. “Maybe I should go after my dream and publish my writing,” she says. “This is my opportunity, my chance.”
On a typical day,Jackson wakes up at “a reasonable time,” for her around 11 a.m. or noon, and starts her morning with some yoga or meditation. She attends class, cooks some dinner, “tr[ies] to do homework in between binge-watching Netflix,” and then settles down for the evening. As part of her nightly routine, she likes to light a candle and read. “I like to start with something spiritual and end with something spiritual, to have some grounding and not go crazy from everything happening outside,” Jackson says.
Jackson plans to live on-campus for the spring semester. She looks forward to seeing her friends and, surprisingly, studying at Widener Library. “I love the feel of being in the library and just the smell of books,” she says wistfully. She also speaks fondly of spontaneous run-ins with friends in the Smith Campus Center — “that was so beautiful,” she says, nearly choked-up.
As for the online experience, it hasn’t been too bad. “The classes are still, you know, as difficult as they always are, but I think I’ve made more time for things I love,” she says. “Now that I see how important it is.”

“It’s like I’m working in three countries at the same time,” Barbara A. Oedayrajsingh Varma ’21 says. As we talk over Zoom, Oedayrajsingh Varma is eating dinner — microwavable falafel, which she had just plopped on her plate as she joined the call. “Isn’t it 11 p.m., there?” I ask. “You eat late!”
Oedayrajsingh Varma explains to me that, after finishing her workday, which actually consists of three jobs, all of which she completes from her apartment — a job with Boston Consulting Group’s Amsterdam branch, a job assisting applied psychological research with a business school in Paris, and a job with a start-up in London — she goes on a walk through her neighborhood in the Shoreditch district of London. She then runs to the supermarket right before it closes, makes a beeline to the discount pile, and grabs the first thing she can get her hands on. Tonight, it was the falafel.
Oedayrajsingh Varma had lived on campus until August, when she briefly returned to her childhood home in The Hague, Netherlands. She had tried to go back home in May, but her flight was delayed five times. Finally, she acquiesced. She accepted Harvard’s offer for summer housing and moved into Hampden Hall, right above the Harvard Book Store. For Oedayrajsingh Varma, this felt a little cruel: “The one time in my life I live above a bookstore and it’s closed.” But eventually the bookstore opened along with the rest of Harvard Square, and — for a brief moment — things seemed sort of, kind of okay. “It was nice to slowly see things get a little better in June and July. It was nice to see Harvard Square come a little bit back to life,” Oedayrajsingh Varma says. “I finally got to go to the bookstore!”
When she decided she would take the year off from school, she lost her student visa and had to leave the U.S.; she found herself in London, subletting a room from friends and working. Oedayrajsingh Varma describes daily life in London as vertiginous: coffee shops and restaurants are allowed to seat customers one day, face restrictions the next, open a few days laters, and then the cycle repeats. Her only constants are long walks and the hush that has settled upon the city in the absence of tourists. “When you walk by Buckingham Palace, there’s almost no one in front of it,” Oedayrajsingh Varma says. In her apartment, she does yoga and keeps a running Microsoft Word document of daily letters addressed to different friends. “It’s like 40 or 50 pages long by now,” she tells me. She plans on sending them out after the pandemic is over. But for now, it’s just nice to keep them to herself, she says, to scroll through and see how her thoughts and feelings about this year have changed, how she has gone from seeing the pandemic as a blip to a tragedy.
I ask Oedayrajsingh Varma if she’s planning on going home for the holidays. She tells me yes, but she then mentions that she’d already been home three weeks earlier, when her grandmother passed away from COVID-19. Oedayrajsingh Varma’s grandmother had been living in a care home for the eldery in the Netherlands, and many people in the home contracted COVID-19 that same week. Many died. No one is sure how the virus entered the care home in the first place. “I felt so defeated,” Oedayrajsingh Varma says. “I’ve changed my life so much to try and keep my loved ones safe. But anything can happen.”
Oedayrajsingh Varma got tested before leaving London and went home to be with her mother and sister. They spent the first week quarantining in their house before leaving to attend the funeral — an event for which the Netherlands permits its citizens to break lockdown. Oedayrajsingh Varma pauses at this point and tells me, “When I hear myself talking about my life in London to you now, I hear someone making the most of this situation. But, in the end, the reason why I took time off is because we’re in this crisis that impacts people’s lives deeply.”
By now, it is almost midnight in London, and we have spent the past hour moving through eight months of her life defined by a dizzying dissonance: making the most of something, yet needing to grapple with what that something is. Oedayrajsingh Varma says she feels defeated. But, peering at her face on my smudged laptop screen, I don’t see defeated. It is midnight in London, and Oedayrajsingh Varma seems wide-awake, cheery, light. She has just finished the last few bites of her falafel. I tell her that I’ve gotten everything I need for the interview, that we’re all set here. She stops me, asks me how I’m doing. She says she hopes we’ll bump into each other on campus next year.

“There’s about a 50 percent chance that they can re-graph the bones from somewhere else on my body,” Michael A. Medaugh ’21 recalls a doctor telling him. “And there’s another 50 percent chance that they’re going to have to fuse my wrist.”
Medaugh received the prognosis only a few weeks before our first phone conversation. He was devastated.
“What that means to Michael, surgeon-in-training,” he explains, “is that there’s about a 50 percent chance that I won’t be able to operate, I won’t be able to be a surgeon.”
The news hit Medaugh “like a brick wall.” When he enters surgery on Jan. 6, he’ll place his lifelong dream — to work as an experimental surgeon — in someone else’s hands. The operation would mend an injury that occurred seven years prior: While Medaugh was in high school, he broke his wrist but since he didn’t have medical insurance, he never got it fixed. The injury has been “festering” ever since, he says. Over the summer, it evolved into “excruciating pain every day.”
Medaugh is optimistic that the doctors will beat the odds; he is also a realist, however, and has begun looking more seriously into “the surgical engineering route of being an M.D.-Ph.D. or research development of surgical practices.”
Medaugh has taken the fall semester off and plans to extend his leave to the spring; as of now, he will graduate in the spring of 2022. But unlike most of his classmates, he will not only be graduating with a degree from Harvard College, but also an S.M. in biomedical engineering through the Concurrent Masters program.
Medaugh’s passion is healthcare, “making sure people have access to the resources that they need to stay happy and healthy.” He is particularly interested in experimental medicine, which saved his mother’s life after a severe car accident when he was young. “She was the fourth person to have the surgery she underwent,” he says. Motivated by his experiences, Medaugh has committed his academic studies toward a career in “surgical or prosthetic development.”
But Medaugh also has a seemingly unrelated, and what was for him unexpected, passion: men’s lightweight rowing.
Medaugh says he went to “a very poor high school” without a crew program. He walked onto the rowing team because of a Subway sandwich. “My friend bribed me onto the team by saying, ‘if you come try out for rowing with me, I’ll buy you a Subway sandwich afterwards,’” he recalls. “And I was thinking, ‘Hey, that’s dinner. I got to go.”
To his surprise, Medaugh received much more than a Footlong for following his friend to the tryouts. “I came in as an absolute novice,” he says, “and pre-COVID I would have been the top one or two boats.”
Medaugh is a coxswain for the men’s lightweight rowing team and hopes to continue rowing beyond graduation. He is considering applying to medical schools in the United Kingdom so that he might be able to continue rowing while he pursues his M.D. “Everyone thinks I’m an absolute lunatic,” he admits. He doesn’t let it get to him.
During the COVID-19 pandemic — which touched Medaugh personally — rowing continued to pay dividends. Medaugh had a spring lab research job and two separate summer jobs cancelled due to the pandemic. He elected to stay in Winthrop House for the spring and summer. But he needed a place to stay and a way to support himself financially when his leave was set to begin in the fall.
Medaugh’s “second rowing family” at the Riverside Boat Club came through with help. A fellow coxswain and friend of his reached out to a colleague of hers who ran a rowing club in Duxbury, Mass., a town about an hour south of Boston. The club needed a coach. Medaugh took her up on the opportunity — and excelled.
Medaugh’s coaching performance this fall earned him an extension to the spring. He also received free courses to earn Level 2 Certification as a national team coach from U.S.Rowing — an impressive feat at his age. At the same time, he also developed an Advanced Placement test tutoring program — adding another source of needed income.
And amid the physical and emotional distancing necessitated by the pandemic, Medaugh has still managed to build new relationships and support systems — some of them not necessarily “interpersonal” in the literal sense.
Medaugh had wanted to buy a pet fish for months — he even sent his girlfriend several different options available at auctions. But he could never bring himself to commit. “You need to have a fish or you’re going to lose your mind,” she eventually told him. “You need to get some fish.”
As Medaugh recounts the last nine months to me over the phone — the trepidation of an anticipated surgery, the joy of coaching rowing — he tells me that six 10-gallon fish tanks surround his head. He elected to take his girlfriend’s advice: Today, he’s the the proud caretaker of around 100 guppies. Currently a member of the Boston Aquarium Society, Medaugh hopes to officially join the “International Fancy Guppy Association” in the near future.
When days are especially tough and Medaugh is tempted to just stay in bed, he says that it’s his guppies that make him put his feet on the floor. “My fish need to be fed; they need to have their water changed. I need to get up.”
In Duxbury, Mass., removed from his friends and teammates, his research labs and his coursework, Medaugh says he feels detached from the Harvard community. Still, he’s looking forward to the day he’ll return to campus. “I’m excited to go back; I’m excited to learn,” he says. “I’m nervous about a lot of things. I think it’ll be okay.”
