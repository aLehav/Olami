After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like all Americans, Harvard students were more than relieved to learn of the death of Osama bin Laden on Sunday night. Echoing scenes in Washington D.C., New York, and on other college campuses, students gathered in the Yard to celebrate the killing of the man responsible for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
In an ideal world, of course, there would have been no “victory” rally—there would only have been a show of empathy for bin Laden’s victims, if anything at all. Indeed, jubilation at the death of another human being—expressed in a frat-party atmosphere—is hardly the most appropriate way to convey American values to the rest of the world. But we do not live in an ideal world. While we regret that large groups of Americans should come out en masse to celebrate the death of one individual as a symbol of national pride, the reaction—after the emotional trauma of September 11—is inevitable and understandable.
Here in Harvard Yard, outside the White House in Washington, D.C., and in countless other locations across the country, thousands of young people took to the streets to celebrate what they perceived to be a crucial moment in world history. That’s only to be expected, as the current generation of college-age students and those a few years older and younger have spent much of their lives with the shadow of 9/11 and terrorism hanging over them. The September 11 attacks happened a decade ago, but the specter of terrorism has lingered long after Ground Zero was cleared and the Pentagon was rebuilt. In that sense, we hope that bin Laden’s death, for better or worse, brings some sort of closure to the memories of 9/11 in our lives.
The reaction to bin Laden’s death is interesting not because of what it was per se but rather because of what it has the potential to do. It’s time that we move on, as a nation and as individuals.
After Al Qaeda’s attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, much of public discourse on national security and foreign policy has focused on terrorism, both the living memory of September 11 and the continuing threat posed by an elusive terrorist organization and its totemic leader. The spontaneous outpouring of positive emotion on Sunday night, and subsequent newspaper headlines on Monday morning heralding the demise of America’s public enemy number one, are testament to how much the fear of terrorism remains central to public mindset. But perhaps this cathartic experience—the relief at bin Laden’s death—can finally help Americans move on from living under the shadow of 9/11. We frequently refer to the “post-9/11 world” that we are now living in as a metonym for the threat posed by terrorism and realization that many people in the world are anti-American. Perhaps, the demarcation point of having beaten bin Laden can help us move past this terminology. It would be wrong to forget the tragedy of 3,000 civilians killed in an unprovoked attack, but we might some time ago have put this event into perspective as history, rather than as a continuing horror.
Still, the killing of Osama bin Laden also presents a good moment to move on from a narrow focus on terrorism as the most important concern of foreign policy and national security. The Middle East and Islamic world, where only a tiny fraction of the population subscribe to fundamentalist Islamist views, must not be viewed as an opponent but an essential partner in combating terrorism and the widespread of resentment of American actions in the international sphere. Similarly, recent events in domestic politics have revealed an apparent widespread suspicion of many American Muslims, from the controversy of Cordoba House to McCarthy-esque congressional hearings of Peter King. Once we can move on from a singular fear of terrorism, perhaps people will cease asking that Muslims must prove that they are not extremists.
Students who rallied across America on Sunday night expressed a relief that we all shared, knowing that bin Laden, one of the world’s most dangerous terrorists, had been killed and troves of valuable information taken from his home. But it is time to move on from the mentality that September 11 , 2001 should remain a central part of our public discourse, or that the best way to preserve our general welfare is to spend so much money and energy attacking the handful of people who would commit such an atrocity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, the Situation Room heard the news: “Visual on Geronimo.” That night, President Barack Obama informed the nation what savvy Twitter users already knew, that Osama bin Laden was dead. The media games promptly began: in-depth looks into the actual operation, interviews with officials involved, and, of course, discussions about what backlash might follow. Those who read or watch the news will probably feel inundated already by such material trying to make sense of the surprising event and its potential impact. Humor me, however, as I consider a simple question of arithmetic about the raid.
Twenty-two – five – ten = seven.
Everyone knows that Osama bin Laden died Sunday, but there were 22 people in the compound in Abbottabad. We know that both bin Laden and his youngest son and potential heir-apparent Hamza—though the experiences of bin Laden’s fourth son, Omar, must caution our understanding of the now-dead Hamza’s intended role—were shot on the upper floors of the compound. According to White House press secretary Jay Carney, two Al Qaeda couriers and a woman unrelated to bin Laden were shot by U.S. forces on the first floor. That means that while the United States only looked to identify one corpse, they created five on Sunday.
Now we get to the part of the narrative that might not be as familiar, the part of the story that has a long way to go. Reuters has reported that ten relatives of Osama bin Laden, including one of his wives, presumably the one the White House has clarified was shot but not killed, have been taken into Pakistani custody. According to the Pakistani intelligence official interviewed by Reuters, these family of Osama bin Laden would have been taken back with the U.S. forces but for a problem of logistics: the malfunction and demolition of one of the raid’s helicopters left only enough room for the returning commandos, their macabre prize, and “other male captives.”
Here is the source of the little equation above. News reports, such as this one from the Atlantic, have used this information that Pakistan holds bin Laden’s relatives to mean that the mission had to change on the fly, from a prisoner extraction to a no-prisoners operation. The narrative is problematic. Was the operation always a “kill operation,” or would the forces have attempted to capture bin Laden if he did not resist, as CIA director Leon Panetta claimed yesterday? The White House’s line is that bin Laden was unarmed but still resisted—and it’s up to you to decide what’s the most plausible scenario there. Rather than speculate on the U.S. government’s priority with bin Laden, it seems obvious that the mission was not a pure “kill” one: If the Navy SEAL Team Six left ten people behind and killed five, we are missing seven people.
The truth appears to be that we did want prisoners—just maybe not the headache of bin Laden as one. Those choppers got fully loaded, to be sure, but the wife and young children of the terrorist were simply lower priority than the “male captives” taken. They were also lower priority than certain inanimate items captured, as well: entire computers, hard drives, and other electronics, enough to merit a new task force within the CIA. We know that two of the men killed in the assault were couriers and the last was Hamza bin Laden. We may never know the identities or roles of the members of the compound extracted.
There are so many questions to ask in the aftermath of bin Laden’s death that it is understandable if this question of the “Bin Laden Seven” will not rule the newswires. We first have to wonder about the future leadership of Al Qaeda and the next steps in our mess of a relationship with Pakistan.
Yet I am disappointed in the lack of imagination of our media and public forums. It is human nature to contextualize this event with affairs back home, and journalists will earn a couple paychecks playing parlor games about whether we are safer now or more at risk, while pollsters will feed the political beast and examine how bin Laden’s death affects the 2012 presidential election.
What we should want to know is what will happen to those captives and hard drives. What information do they have to share? Detainees provided the tip-off that ultimately led to bin Laden’s death, though not through waterboarding, as rightwing Bush apologists now want us to believe. These new detainees, the Bin Laden Seven, may have much more to share. Meanwhile, the National Security Agency must be chomping at the bit to get its hands on the electronics seized by the SEALs.
We may never know the fate of the men or the hardware, and the circumstances of their acquisition have already taken the back seat to bin Laden’s death. But given the potential breakthroughs they may enable, we should certainly be asking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday night, Harvard students followed young Americans across the country by celebrating in public the killing of Osama bin Laden. Here, some of our columnists offer their reaction to bin Laden’ death, our response, and what it all means, in our new online "Columnist Conversations" feature. A reduced version of these views was printed on The Crimson's opinion page on May 4, 2011.
Don't Trivialize
Osama bin Laden's death has been called a mainly symbolic victory but its success should not be trivialized. While the U.S. personnel abroad certainly know one death will not suddenly end their operations or immediately lessen the dangers they face, they will still be rightfully proud. As for our citizens back home, they deserve to respond to bin Laden’s death however they choose. I’ve been disappointed by those who have been quick to judge their fellow citizens and criticize their celebrations. People find closure in this death on a very individual level. For some, such closure might mean quiet contemplation or minimal impact; for others, there is catharsis in jubilation. Perhaps as a New Yorker I am more sensitive to the scars that will heal better for some now—take Hank Grazioso’s tragic story as just one example. I choose to put faith in my fellow students and assume that the celebrations in Harvard Yard Sunday night and around campus—including in my own common room—were for the many victims of whom we all know, and for the relief we can feel as a nation. The debate over whether students were celebrating “death” misses the point.  Just as the nation claimed to stand with the victims and New York after 9/11, so should it stand together as we react in our own ways.

Move on from Terror
Dylan R. Matthews ‘12: I'm glad Osama bin Laden is dead. It's an important symbolic and, if we're lucky, operational blow to al-Qaeda, and offers closure to people who were due it years ago. That said, this is as good a time as any to recognize that terrorism, while horrible, is one threat to the United States among many. As the political scientist John E. Mueller has been noting for years, the number of Americans killed by terrorism is in most years comparable to the number killed by lightning, and pales in comparison to the number killed by auto accidents. It is rather hard to come up with a good reason why we spend orders of magnitude trying to prevent deaths from terrorism than on tackling these more mundane threats. Sunday's raid brought us as clear a denouement as we're going to get in the war on terrorism. It's time to move on.

Our Voldemort
Osama is our Voldemort. He’s our Emperor Palpatine. He is the Face of Evil, a mythical holdover from when we were too young to realize that evil has no face. After all, our generation is generally not allowed to call anyone evil. No one is evil, they told us. They just had weird childhoods. Except Osama. He was pure evil, an acceptable target, the video game villain at the end of the level. And this was a relief. In our guts, we are accustomed to simple villains.
So for people my age, the idea that you would greet the news of Osama’s demise with anything short of unmitigated exhilaration is ludicrous. Call up the Ewoks and get the bonfires started. Gather the, er, wizards, for the wizard banquet. We got him. The Big Honcho. The top cheese. The chief muck-a-muck. Besides, we’ll take any excuse to party.
But once we got started, the revel felt unseemly. It was simply the celebration of the death of one man, not a complete victory over any ultimate evil. Even as we cheered, we knew better. For us at 12 and 14, Osama was a reassuring monster. He was the face behind the random terror of the universe, the dragon we could slay and beat, the Boss of the Level. Now we understand that we have scorched the snake, not killed it. We know the difference between a hydra and a dragon.
But there is still that 12-year-old inside us, exultantly staring down the reactor shaft where we just tossed the Emperor.
Of course we’d want to party.

Reflecting on Obama’s Speech
President Obama deserves our unalloyed praise for hastening Osama bin Laden’s demise. Yes, President George W. Bush established the mission, but Obama made it a priority. Yes, the CIA secured the intelligence, but Obama acted on it. By doing so, he exhibited the quality that his supporters have long attributed to him without much evidence: judgment.
The operation was extremely risky, and the president was intimately involved. Although the CIA was unsure whether bin Laden was inside the compound—some analysts put odds at 60 percent—Obama carried on. His national-security advisers were divided over whether to attack by air or by land, but the president knew we needed the body. He ordered a ground assault. And despite the risk that Pakistan would chafe at a military strike deep inside its borders—and at our lack of a warning—the president knew too much was at stake. He made the right calls, and they paid off.
The president’s speech to the nation, on the other hand, deserves praise of a tepid kind—not because he did anything egregiously wrong, but because he didn’t do anything especially right. Appropriately, his voice was grave, his countenance sober. He reflected the gravity of the moment. (He also was probably tired.)
He spoke movingly about 9/11, placing the images of “hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky” and “black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon” squarely in our minds. He spoke concretely (but, thankfully, not too concretely) about the operation: his initial order to CIA director Leon Panetta, his subsequent meetings with advisers, his final decision to make the attack. He reminded the nation, and the world, that ours is not a war against Islam, that we are grateful for our military, and that we still feel the pain of 9/11.
Nonetheless, nothing he said was particularly memorable. (I admit I made use of a transcript.) And the president has an unfortunate tendency of ending his speeches with a little-engine-that-could shtick. “Tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to,” he said. “That is the story of our history, whether it’s the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens.”
It was as if he were giving us a pep talk. And so the president pulled a switcheroo on Sunday: He showed himself to be less than eloquent and more than wise.

Far From Over
Don’t get me wrong. I rejoiced when I read that bin Laden was killed. I felt a tremendous surge of gratitude to our soldiers and pride in our country. But somehow I didn’t feel the urge to go out into Yard and party.
Maybe that’s because some part of me believes that we shouldn’t be dancing over the deaths of our enemies. But it could also be because the networks that bin Laden created are still firmly in place. Bin Laden already has a very likely successor in the form of Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Al Qaida splinter groups like the AQAP are still recruiting actively. Bin Laden was the charismatic figurehead of this organization, but I’m much more fearful of the legacy that he left behind. Wave our nation’s flag and blast that song from “Team America” if you must, but the moment our jingoism wears off this country must realize that our fight is far from over.

The End of an Era
What can be said that hasn’t already been said—other than that we finally seem to have arrived at the letter bookend of the Bush era? Much as the 90s didn’t end until September 11th, only now are the Aughts—an era haunted by the psychic specter of the ever-at-large bin Laden—truly at an end. Between the election of Barack Obama, the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and now, the death of public enemy number one, we have finally turned the page on an age marred by fear, distrust, and paranoia. But only by reversing the cancerous growth of the surveillance state and somehow extracting ourselves from the Afghan tar baby can we ever be completely free from bin Laden’s shadow.

Celebrating Ourselves
What struck me about the post-speech celebration in the Yard on Sunday is that for a “death celebration” it was overwhelmingly positive. The chants of “U.S.A! U.S.A!” were joyful. No one was cheering “Kill the terrorists,” or anything near as vitriolic as is heard at an average Harvard-Yale game. For this reason, it would be a mistake to think all the students who took to the Yard were celebrating a death. Bin Laden himself was perhaps beside the point. We’re all savvy enough to realize that this does not mean a return to Pax Americana. On Monday, 13 civilians were killed in war-related violence in Iraq. Last Wednesday, eight American troops were killed in a shooting rampage on an Afghan air base. America still has significant military commitments around the globe that show no sign of diminishing. In the end, the death of an old war enemy in a compound without Internet or phone lines is simply not practically significant. Indeed, bin Laden’s death is a Rorschach test for what each person feels about the “war on terror,” America’s international status, and the individual’s place in the world. As such, the reaction over it reflects more of our own insecurities and joys than anything about the man.

Remember Harvard’s Ties
Harvard students gathered in the Yard on Sunday to sound a barbaric yawp of patriotism. It seems fair to say that for those students, Osama bin Laden could not have been farther removed from America’s oldest university, the ideals for which it stands, and the patriotic zeal it apparently inspires. But before we all jump on the rickety bandwagon that equates Harvard with American patriotic fervor, it’s worth remembering the University’s ties to the bin Laden family—not because these ties implicate Harvard in any way but rather because they show the nuances behind any issue of this magnitude. In the early 1990s, for instance, bin Laden’s own brother—Sheik Bakr Mohammed bin Laden—made two substantive gifts to Harvard to fund fellowships, including one to the Law School to fund the research of historical Islamic legal systems “particularly insofar as they uphold or apply the Islamic shari’a.” Some years later, after Osama bin Laden had been suspected of embassy bombings in Africa, a University spokesman even made the distinction that here in Cambridge, at least, “the Saudi bin Laden money is being put to good use.” In that sense, the Sunday night celebration seemed a bit, well, misguided.

Good Grief
Some on campus have moralistically complained that it was wrong of students to celebrate the death of bin Laden by cheering, waving American flags, and singing patriotic songs in Harvard Yard the night the news arrived. I realize Harvard students can often be disconnected from reality and that some campus leftists see no distinction between patriotism and jingoism, but good grief. But part of valuing freedom and human life is defending them from those who would replace them with tyranny and death. Sometimes this defense requires force, and sometimes even lethal force.

On Celebrating Closure
Just after midnight Monday morning, immediately after President Barack Obama told the world that U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in a firefight, Harvard Yard erupted in a spontaneous celebration of proud patriotism and national unity.  It was not just a celebration of retributive justice being served.  It was one of good prevailing over evil.  As is often the case on our contentious campus, the opinions of students quickly catalyzed around the event.  Some argue the events of Monday morning were “hypocritical” and “decidedly anti-American” – this is simply not the case.  Celebrating the closure bin Laden’s death brings to the free world is morally and unambiguously justified.
In an ideal world, nobody’s death would be celebrated because everyone would be good.  Unfortunately, our world is far from ideal.  Sunday’s victory was one of justice being served.  At least bin Laden could mount a defense; the thousands he massacred could not.  They were not soldiers or self-proclaimed terrorist leaders, and they were not killed in a 40-minute-long firefight.  No, those who died on 9/11 had no idea they were being hunted, no idea their lives would be taken by a terrorist mastermind half a world away.
So to those who ask how we are different from the terrorists when we celebrate the death of bin Laden – that is the answer.  Bin Laden wished to instill fear in the hearts of all the free people of the world.  He knew he was perpetrating an act that invited retribution and delighted in being on the run.  Bin Laden had nearly ten more years of freedom and life than his victims.  In the end, he suffered the consequences of his own choice not to surrender.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences deficit is expected to shrink to $16 million from $35 million by the end of the current fiscal year, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting.
The progress, Smith said, keeps FAS on track to balance its structural deficit by the end of the 2012 fiscal year—a budget reduction he hopes to accomplish by tapping into FAS reserves, he wrote in an email to faculty and senior staff members.
Beyond discussion on the budget, the Faculty debated a new University-wide Faculty Advisory Council on the Harvard Library, the new centralized system that will oversee the management of Harvard’s 16 million volumes. Faculty also approved the list of
Courses of Instruction for FAS and the Extension School for the next academic year and updates to the Handbook for Students. As part of their report on the Standing Committee on Public Service, Sociology Professor Christopher Winship and Social Studies Director of Studies Anya Bernstein implored the faculty to participate more actively in encouraging their students to partake in public service.
REDUCING THE RED
After notifying the faculty and senior staff members by email early morning Tuesday, Smith announced positive developments in the reduction of the budget deficit by $19 million in the meeting.
“It’s good news,” Smith said.
Cookies even made their way back to the tables, Smith noted.
But the reductions have taken time. FAS has struggled over two years to reduce the deficit, which originally stood at $220 million, quickly reducing it to $110 million by the end of the 2009 fiscal year and down further to $35 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year.
But the remaining cuts for the past academic year have been “the most difficult yet,” with reductions coming from the centers, unrestricted alumni donations, and larger savings in the College and Athletics.
Smith especially praised centers for doing the “yeoman’s work” in cutting their respective budgets.
Smith said the most recent announcement keeps FAS on track to balance its budget by the end of the 2012 fiscal year—a promise he made at the beginning of the crisis.
LIBRARY LEGISLATION
Presenting the nominations to the University-wide Faculty Advisory Council to the Harvard Library, Director of the Harvard University Library Robert C. Darnton ’60 received some criticism from several faculty members, who expressed concern about the small size of the committee.
“I think the new committee will be too small, and I think that the centralization doesn’t need to be balanced by the clear individuals of the stakeholders in the committee,” English Professor Nicholas J. Watson said.
Watson continued to argue that a loss of “diversity of faculty” would compromise the committee’s capacity to express the full opinion of FAS. To prevent this outcome, Watson argued that the committee members should create a website to solicit faculty opinion.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations Department Chair Wilt E. Idema expressed a larger concern that with a line-up of mainly “Western-centric” thinkers, collections on other parts of the world might go neglected.
“I have great confidence in the members listed,” Idema said, “but some opinions from someone outside from the Western opinion might be useful in developing our collections.”
No one responded to Watson’s or Idema’s concerns, and when the motion for the committee members was taken to vote, no one voted against the proposal.
THE BUREAUCRACY
On behalf of the FAS Standing Committee on Public Service, Winship asked for “more faculty involvement.”
Winship said the committee, which provides oversight for over 130 undergraduate public service programs, requires more faculty members to join.
“The workload is light, but its importance is substantial,” Winship said.
Faculty otherwise approved criteria for the next academic year, passing the Courses of Instruction for the next academic year and changes in the handbook policy.
In particular, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris moved to formally adopt policies on the honors system—which the faculty voted on before and will relax the system and better define regulations—into the student handbook. Smith also called for the faculty to approve the courses of instruction for tomorrow.
Smith also awarded teaching awards to members of FAS, recognizing others for any national recognition also won.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jason F. Aquino, one of three men implicated in the fatal 2009 shooting of Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland House, was sentenced Monday to 18 to 20 years in prison.
Aquino pleaded guilty in March to manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He was originally charged with first-degree murder but was permitted to plea to a lesser charge in exchange for cooperating with the prosecution.
Aquino made a plea agreement in September 2009 which would have guaranteed him no more than five years in prison. But prosecutors revoked the agreement when they found that he had made false statements to the grand jury.
Most notably, Aquino originally said that he had waited in the courtyard in front of the Kirkland annex while the other two murder defendants, Jabrai Jordan Copney and Blayn Jiggetts, led Cosby into Kirkland’s J-entryway. There, Cosby was held up for marijuana and then shot when he refused to hand over the drugs.
Several eyewitnesses later said that Aquino was not standing in the courtyard during the incident; in fact, they said, three men followed the bleeding victim out of the entryway.
As a consequence of those lies, Superior Court Judge Howard Whitehead sentenced Aquino on Monday to four to five years in prison for willfully misleading a grand jury—to be served concurrently with the 18 to 20 years for manslaughter, according to Middlesex District Attorney’s office spokesperson Cara O’Brien and to Aquino’s attorney Matthew A. Kamholtz.
Though prosecutors have named Copney as the man who fired the three shots—one of which fatally struck Cosby in the abdomen—all three men were originally charged with first-degree murder, based on their plan to rob Cosby of marijuana at gunpoint. The felonymurder theory, one of three bases for first-degree murder, legally permits someone to be found guilty of the most serious murder if a killing occurs during the commission or intended commission of any felony punishable by up to life in prison.
Jiggetts has also pleaded guilty to manslaughter and has been promised a sentence of 9 to 12 years, based in large part on his cooperation as a witness against Copney at the accused gunman’s recent trial.
O’Brien said that Jiggetts’ sentencing will take place after the trial of the fourth defendant in the case, Brittany J. Smith, who was a Harvard senior when the murder occurred.
Aquino was not called as a witness in Copney’s trial.
After a three-week trial, Copney was found guilty of first-degree murder last month. He received a sentence of life without parole, the mandatory penalty for first-degree murder.
Discussing Aquino, Jiggetts, and Copney’s widely varying sentences, Kamholtz said, “I think the sentences in part represent the level of culpability of the defendant but not entirely.... I think that an effort was made on the part of the DA’s office to get the information that they needed and to assess the relative culpability of the defendants.”
He called his client’s sentence “fair.”
Smith, the remaining defendant, was a Lowell House resident and Copney’s girlfriend at the time of the shooting. She has been charged with accessory after the fact of murder and five other counts based on allegations that she hid the murder weapon and helped the killers flee Cambridge.
In a statement following Aquino’s sentencing, Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. ’85 said, “Our efforts continue as we turn our attention to the sentencing of Blayn Jiggetts, and the trial of Brittany Smith.”
Smith has filed a motion asking that the charges against her be dismissed, based on an earlier cooperation agreement which prosecutors say she has violated by lying to investigators.
Middlesex First Assistant Clerk Matthew Day said that Judge Diane M. Kottmyer will rule on the motion before or at Smith’s scheduled court appearance on Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cabot Cafe kicked off its four day preview period with a crowd and a series of live performances Tuesday night in what Cabot residents formerly called “the Television Room,” a room in the basement of Cabot House. The Cafe will formally open in the fall.
Cafe organizers and opening night attendees hailed the Cafe as an improvement to student life in the Quad.
“I think it’s really great. We’re making use of space in the Quad,” said Talia M. Fox ’13, who attended the Cafe’s opening night. “It brings attention to how great this place is.”
Annie M. Baldwin ’13 said that while Pforzheimer House has a grill that is open late at night, the coffee and pastry offerings at Cabot Cafe are markedly different. The Cafe gives the Quad a taste of the cafes and coffee shops located near the River Houses, she said.
“We don’t have that many perks in the Quad. It’s nice to have our own little hangout space,” Melanie A. Fontes ’13 said while studying at one of the Cafe’s tables. “I want it to end up like the cafe on ‘Friends.’ I think that’s where it’s headed.”
The Cafe, which has been in the works since last fall, is the result of months of effort by Cabot residents Laura S. Hinton ’13, Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, Chandan G. Lodha ’13, and Crimson photo editor Daniel M. Lynch ’13.
Lodha said that Kaplan and Lynch were the first to get the concept moving.
The group dealt with everything from purchasing the furniture to dealing with Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services to selecting coffee and pastry vendors.
Ultimately, the group chose Petsi Pies for the pastries and Dunkin Donuts and Barismo for the coffee.
The opening night food selection included blueberry muffins, brownies, iced coffee, and more.
The Cafe was funded by the student organizers along with contributions from Cabot House Masters Rakesh and Stephanie R. Khurana.
The student funding of the project makes it a unique food outlet for students on campus, Lodha said. He said that any profits that the Cafe makes will go to the project’s organizers.
While the hours for the fall are yet to be decided, Kaplan said it will definitely stay open at night.
He said that they would respond to student demand when deciding whether to open it for additional hours.
The Cafe is located in what was formerly the Cabot TCR, which included a television and casual social space.Kaplan said that prior to being used for television viewing, the room had been used as a convenience store.
During its four day preview period, the Cafe will be open from 8 p.m. through midnight until this Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friends of Clare M. Gillis—Harvard graduate and freelance journalist—urged for more action to bring back captured journalists in Libya at an event on Tuesday, which was World Press Freedom Day and also marked a month after Gillis was captured by Libyan loyalists.
A group of Gillis’ friends showed their support at an event in Boston honoring the work of James Foley, another freelance reporter who was detained in Libya with Gillis.
Family and friends of Foley shared his stories and writings, in addition to combat videos recorded while he was in Libya.
Ece G. Turnator, a Harvard graduate student who has known Gillis for five years, delivered a brief speech in support of the event and called for joint efforts to expedite the release of Foley and Gillis.
“We should act together and show a united front,” Turnator said. “When both come back, we will have a good party.”
Yet despite the optimism expressed by Turnator, the recent developments in Libya have made the situation of the captured journalists more uncertain than a week ago, when Gillis was allowed to make a second call home.
The Turkish government, which was previously negotiating for the journalists’ release through its embassy in Tripoli, made the decision to temporarily evacuate the embassy on Monday due to safety concerns following the NATO mission strike that the Libyan government claims killed one of Muammar Gaddafi’s sons and three of his grandchildren.
Michael Foley, James Foley’s brother, said the U.S. Department of State has not communicated to him about a “second course of action” after the Turkish embassy evacuation.
“The situation is dire out there,” Michael Foley said. “The amount of action required of all of us has now doubled. One conclusion is that if people in the room here aren’t prone to action, I don’t know if we will see a positive outcome.”
Renee Loth, an editorial editor at The Boston Globe who was at the event, stressed journalists’ safety and acknowledged the importance of Gillis and Foley’s work.
“Journalists operating in war zones should be considered civilians, with all the protection and immunity that civilians enjoy,” Loth said. “Reporters like James and Clare are the root and branches of democracy—they must be protected.”
Friends of Gillis are planning on holding a vigil in Harvard Yard next Monday, hoping to draw more support and attention to Gillis’ situation in Libya.
“This event shows a lot of people are putting pressure on all that they can think of to get the release of the imprisoned journalists,” said Jesse C. Howell, another friend of Gillis and a Harvard graduate student.
Howell said that individuals should continue to publicize the journalists’ ongoing captivity via mass media and the U.S. should uphold diplomatic pressure on the Libyan government.
“It makes me feel much more real to be here, hearing James’ parents talk. It also makes Clare’s situation much more present,” Howell added. “We really don’t know what effort would create the change, but like Michael said, there is really no effort that’s too small.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cookies are back, baby.
Even though beach season is less than a month away, professors munched away on the much-missed sweets in Tuesday’s Faculty meeting. Sitting through a list of award recipients, they repeatedly got up and down to receive applause for their work, while Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith struggled with some names.
But the return of the cookies—a casualty to the worst financial crisis in recent history—would be missed by one historian usually in attendance.
University President Drew G. Faust was in Washington, D.C., delivering the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, leaving Smith jogging between the microphone and the presiding table while trying to juggle responsibilities for leading the Faculty meeting.
COOKIE MONSTER
Once a staple at Faculty meetings, cookies disappeared in fall 2009 as the University sought ways to cut budgets. Losing snacks saved about $500 per meeting, Smith said at the time.
The diet ended Tuesday when two platters—a luxurious spread of cookies, including the classic chocolate chip and the oatmeal raisin—appeared next to the coffee and tea.
“I love cookies,” Smith said unabashedly in an interview with The Crimson after the meeting.
The return of the snacks echoed the promising announcement Smith delivered involving the steady recovery of FAS’ deficit.
While some faculty members enjoyed a cookie with their coffee and tea, others abstained from the sugary dessert. As professors filed out of the meeting, many cookies were left behind.
“We have healthy faculty,” Smith said on why so many cookies remained.
PLEASE STAND UP ... AGAIN
The Faculty meeting began with a lengthy list of awards received by Harvard professors.
Smith asked award recipients to stand as he read their names. Professors, lecturers, administrators, and one prize-winning Peer Advising Fellow hesitantly rose to be acknowledged by the room.
Biology Professor Farish A. Jenkins, Jr., however, got out of his seat a few more times than his colleagues.
After Jenkins received yet another award, laughter broke out as he rose again.
“Yes, we’re very proud of Farish,” Smith quipped.
‘THIS IS WHY NO ONE LIKES ME’
As Smith announced various awards, he listed the full name of the award as well as the full name of the recipient’s professorship—a challenging task if one is not well-acquainted with names that can be phonetically difficult.
After several stumbles, Smith paused and finally gave up on announcing Area Dean for Environmental Science and Engineering Steven C. Wofsy full title—Abbott Lawrence Rotch Professor of Atmospheric and Environmental Science.
“I’ll skip that one,” he said to laughter from the faculty. “This is why no one likes me.”
Following a joke on the easy pronunciation of his name—“This is why I have a simple name like Mike Smith”—he paused when reviewing the large number of faculty accepted into the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
“Too many names here,” Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last four months, one Harvard student has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, visited the pyramids, witnessed lions in their natural habitat, and was even mugged on his first day in Tanzania—an experience which he describes as just one in a series of “pretty crazy adventures.”
Ben Yu completed just his first semester at Harvard before leaving in January to explore the world. Since winter break, he has traveled solo to eastern Africa, Egypt, and California, and is currently in China.
Yu, formerly a member of the class of 2014, intends to take at least another two years off in order to work on his start-up in California.
Although taking a gap year prior to matriculation is increasingly common, taking a semester or more off after starting college in order to pursue travel or work opportunities is a more unusual choice. But multiple students endorse the idea, saying that their time off has given them experiences they could never have gained on campus.
THE DECISION TO LEAVE
Yu credits the book ‘Travels’—written by former Crimson News editor Michael Crichton ’64—as one of the inspirations for his choice to take time off.
He says that while he had been attracted to the idea of traveling ever since high school, he made his decision to leave midway through his first semester at Harvard.
“So midterms roll around, and it’s then I decide that I’ve been in school all my life, I’ve done absolutely nothing else, and I’d probably gain far more from an experience in radically different cultures abroad right now, so I decide to go for it,” Yu writes in an email from China.
Nell S. Hawley ’11 had also entertained ideas of traveling before arriving at Harvard, but ultimately did not make her decision to leave until the spring of her sophomore year.
Hawley took a year off between her sophomore and junior years to live and work in India and Afghanistan. Originally intending to take an intensive Sanskrit course, Hawley ended up working for non-governmental organizations during her time abroad, educating at-risk youth in Delhi and helping to develop a program in Kabul for teenagers with ambitions to start their own businesses.
She says that she was glad she took time to travel midway through her college career rather than spending a year abroad after high school.
“You really are a different person at 20 than at 18,” Hawley says. “I had had more travel experience. I felt I was able to do more interesting things than just travel.”
She also adds that her two years at Harvard had allowed her to find her true passion.
“After two years at Harvard, I knew I loved Sanskrit,” she says.
‘GET UP AND GO’
Multiple students note that taking time off was not as difficult as might be expected.
“Harvard makes it really easy,” says Claire E. Kim ’12, who took off the fall semester of her junior year to work on a congressional campaign in New Hampshire.
According to Kim, Harvard has been very supportive of her and other students when they desire to temporarily leave school.
She adds that she knows a lot of other students who have taken time off school for a variety of reasons.
“It’s generally pretty common at Harvard,” Kim says, explaining that she knows many other students who have chosen to take time off in order to recuperate from large workloads.
Yu says that he is appreciative of the time-off policies Harvard offers its students.
“I could come back in 30 years now and still be able to attend the school, whereas had I taken time off before school, I would have to matriculate within one year or forfeit my spot,” Yu writes.
Hawley agrees with these sentiments, saying that arranging her time off was a relatively simple process, requiring her to speak with her Resident Dean and make arrangements for housing.
“It’s very easy to just get up and go,” Hawley says. “Harvard is very supportive.”
A POSSIBLE DOWNSIDE
But students say taking time off can also come with the disadvantage of being unable to graduate alongside their freshman class.
“Yeah, I miss my friends who have graduated,” Hawley says, adding that she was also annoyed to have been abroad for the election of President Obama.
But Hawley says that this should not deter those who are considering taking a break from college.
“Overall the advantages did outweigh the disadvantages,” she says. She adds that the timing of her year off was particularly important in minimizing the downsides, because when she returned as a junior, her former classmates were still on campus, albeit as seniors.
Kim says that she would not miss out on sharing her class’s senior experiences, such as senior bar and the other perks of senior spring.
Yu mentioned a less commonly cited advantage of taking time off.
“Older guys are supposed to be more attractive, so maybe coming back in two years will be even better.”
‘YOU CAN DO ANYTHING’
The three students agree that their time away from Harvard has been life-changing.
“For someone like me who has spent basically her whole life in school, it was great for me to know that I could go out into the world on my own, get work, do something interesting, and survive,” Hawley says. “Once you’ve arrived in Kabul airport and made your way into the city, you know you can do anything.”
She says that upon returning to Harvard for her junior year, it was strange to be reacquainted with the luxuries that students take for granted, including washing machines and dining hall meals.
“Things that pass us by here—like hot water, plumbing, electricity—you learn to value them,” she says.
Kim says that her campaign experience was integral in framing her time at Harvard.
“I felt like I hadn’t had a lot of experiences where I felt like I made a real impact on the world,” Kim says regarding her time prior to her semester off.
Many of those who have taken time off strongly encourage others to consider the option.
“Don’t be afraid,” Hawley says. “Go for it.”

Captain Collin Zych was not among the 254 players selected in last week’s NFL draft, but the safety still has a shot at making it to the pros
Zych had visits with a number of professional teams, and undrafted players are often signed after the amateur selections to help fill in remaining voids in the roster. Because of the current lockout, the situation becomes more complicated, but he still stands a chance of making it to the NFL as an undrafted signing.
Only one Ivy Leaguer was drafted this year. The Kansas City Chiefs selected Yale’s Shane Bannon, a fullback for the Bulldogs, in the seventh round, with the 223rd overall pick. Bannon is the first Eli to get drafted in seven years.
Per the restrictions of the labor struggles in the NFL, no one can sign contracts, a limitation that affects both drafted and non-drafted prospects.
Zych, the captain of last year’s football team, was first team All-Ivy and Academic All-Ivy. His 79 tackles were tied for best on the team with senior linebacker Nick Hasselberg.
Though Harvard has a number of alumni currently in the NFL, no member of the Crimson squad has been drafted since 2005. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick—likely the most famous Harvard graduate in the NFL—was selected with the 250th overall pick by the St. Louis Rams. He started most of last season for the Buffalo Bills.

Three decades ago, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (9-5, 5-2 Ivy) began what would become an incredible statistic: 11 Ivy League championships in 13 seasons, winning every year from ’81 to ’85 and ’88 to ’93. Today, even after falling short of its 12th-ever title, some of the Crimson’s other statistics are still quite incredible.
Currently, Harvard holds the most potent attack in Ancient Eight women’s lacrosse. The Crimson, amounting for a league-best 174 goals in only 14 games, possesses three of the conference’s most prolific scorers in sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen, the only Ivy League player to average a hat trick or more per contest; sophomore Danielle Tetreault, 4th in the Ancient Eight goals and 5th in assists; and junior Jess Halpern, tenth in the conference with two scores per game.
Despite its top-ranked offense, Harvard’s defense has allowed 142 goals in 14 games played, including a 14-goal loss to last year’s Ancient Eight runner-up and this year's co-champion, Dartmouth. The Big Green have only allowed 114 goals in conference play, the lowest of any team.
Interestingly enough, the last time the Crimson won the Ivy League Tournament, it beat Dartmouth, once in the regular season and again at the NCAA tournament.
But that year would also mark one of the last times Harvard experienced a win over the Big Green or even made it to the national tournament. Since 1994, the Crimson boasts just one tourney berth and one defeat of the Big Green, both of which came before most of this year’s squad was old enough for kindergarten.
Still, with the all-time series stuck at 18-18-1, history may just grant Harvard an edge over its opponents. The last time these two teams faced off in the Ivy League tournament, the Crimson snuck away with an 11-6 win and a championship to show for it.
The rivalry continues this Friday at Penn.

The athlete of the week distinction is meant to honor a single weekend’s performance, usually by a single athlete. But when the Harvard lightweight first varsity eight defeated No. 1 Princeton on the Charles this past weekend, it was the product of a season of dedication by an entire team, not just the nine athletes who raced in that eight on Saturday.
“I think in terms of how our entire program has developed, this is a product of a really solid group of athletes across every class,” said junior seven seat Austin Meyer. “We’ve had an extremely competitive year within the squad, which has proven to be extremely useful when you race other teams.”
That competitiveness manifested itself in undefeated seasons for both the 1V and 2V.
“The 1V and the 2V definitely feed off each other,” Meyer said. “Going into HYPs, we didn’t want to make this the first loss.”
“The boat dynamics have been especially good this year in terms of how we mesh,” said senior two seat Jared Dourdeville. “That’s certainly the case for the 1V, and I think I can speak for the 2V and the 3V was well.”
But while it hadn’t lost, the No. 2 Crimson certainly had close calls. The weekend before it raced the Tigers and Yale, Harvard only defeated Navy, seeded sixth in the EARC, by 1.2 seconds.
Yet the Crimson 1V was able to find enough speed to defeat Princeton, seeded first in the most recent EARC poll, by nearly the same margin, and the Bulldogs, seeded third, by 4.2 seconds.
“We knew we were going to be that extra two percent faster,” said captain and six seat Will Newell. “When you race two teams that are that good, you’re going to have to be at the next level. All three teams showed that they were on that level.”
That tightness was especially apparent at the start of the race, when all three crews were in nearly perfect unison for most of the first 500. Harvard and the Tigers were able to take one-seat leads over Yale in the second 500, but at that point, it was still a three-crew race. Princeton took a move at around the 1000-meter mark that pushed it a deck ahead of the Crimson. But Harvard was able to halt the Tigers’ move by the time the crews passed through the Mass. Ave bridge, and soon took a move of its own.
“We had a really solid third 500,” Newell said.
The Crimson continued to move throughout that 500 to give itself almost a six-seat lead.
Lesser crews might have been broken by Harvard’s move, but Princeton, the defending national champion, made it a fight to the finish. The Tigers spiked the rate to a 39 in the final strokes and were able to move back into the Crimson’s hull, while Harvard spent much of its sprint at a 37.
But Princeton’s surge came too late, and the Crimson was able to hold on for a one second victory.
It was official: Harvard had gone undefeated in the dual season for the second-straight year.
The winning Crimson crew consisted of junior coxswain Angela Chang, sophomore stroke Matt O’Leary, Meyer, Newell, sophomore five seat Erich Schultze, junior four seat Tim Moore, senior three seat Andrew Trott, Dourdeville, and junior bow seat Tom Nesel.
Six of those rowers—Meyer, Newell, Moore, Trott, Dourdeville, and Nesel—rowed in last year’s 1V at some point during last season, but Newell says that despite the two boats’ similar personnel and success, the seasons have been very different.
“In terms of character, they’re very different,” Newell said. “I think everything is worlds different. The way we approach races: it’s been completely different.”
Harvard hopes the end result will be different too. Last year, the Crimson defeated the Tigers in the regular season only to fall to them at Sprints and later at IRAs, where Harvard earned bronze.
“The group hasn’t gotten caught up in the small details. We’ve always had the bigger picture in mind,” Meyer said. “It means nothing in the end if we don’t win. While it’s been a job well done so far, the mission has yet to be accomplished.”
“We have to keep building,” Dourdeville added. “Princeton will be faster, and we will be faster at Sprints...We have to keep our focus forwards.”
With the way the whole squad has been pushing each other, the 1V won’t have a choice but to keep working.
“I’ve been very impressed with the focus and the motivation of the team,” Dourdeville said. “I think Saturday was a culmination of that.”

Unlike the majority of students on campus looking to take advantage of reading period to prepare for finals, the Harvard co-ed sailing team spent the past weekend in pursuit of a goal not entrenched in academia.
Hoping to emulate the success of their female counterparts, who punched their tickets to the national championships at Cascade Locks, Ore., the previous weekend, the Crimson co-eds took their talents to Long Beach, Calif. to compete in the ICSA Eastern Dinghy Championship Semifinals for a spot at nationals.
Only needing a finish in the top half of the field to clinch a spot in the ICSA/Gill Dinghy Championships at the end of the month, Harvard greatly exceeded expectations, finishing in second place, seven spots ahead of the last qualifier.
The Crimson also sailed in the George Morris Trophy Intersectional Regatta on Saturday, this one much closer at home on the waters of the nearby Charles River. With the usual inconsistent weather of the Charles and a bomb scare on the shores of Cambridge, Harvard finished in 11th place in the field of 16.
ICSA EASTERN DINGHY SEMIFINALS
After finishing in second place at nationals last year, the Harvard co-eds were not lacking in motivation when it came to this year’s postseason. When the team departed from Cambridge to compete in the ICSA Eastern Dinghy Championship Semifinals, the sailors only had one thing on their minds: to finish in the top nine and get the chance to compete for its fifth co-ed Dinghy national title.
“The goal has always been to get back to nationals and to do well there,” senior Alan Palmer said. “We only needed to get in the top nine to move on, and after the start we had, it was smooth sailing from there.”
Harvard finished the first day of racing in first place, courtesy of a very strong showing from the Crimson’s A-division team of Palmer and classmate Quincy Bock. The duo cruised to two first-place finishes out of six races on the first day of the regatta and in the top four in five of six races.
In the second day of sailing, Harvard’s A-team faced stiff competition from the A-division boat from Georgetown. The Crimson and the Hoyas were neck and neck for the entire day, with the fight for first place coming down to the wire. If not for a slip-up in the last race of the regatta in which they finished in an uncharacteristic 11th place, Palmer and Bock would have finished atop the A-division. Overall, the pair captured four victories out of 12 races, finishing in second place with a score of 42, only five points behind Georgetown.
“It was a good weekend for us,” Palmer said. “We came out strong on the first day and knew that we had a spot set in the finals, so it ended up being a competition for first with Georgetown. We were solid up until the last race, so we did end the weekend on a bitter note, but we’re still happy with where we are.”
The B-division contingent of seniors John Stokes, Meghan Wareham, and Teddy Himler also found itself embroiled in a heated contest for the top spot in the B-division. The pair had a decent first day of racing, consistently finishing in the top seven, but was unable to crack the top three once. But the two came storming back on the second day, battling for first place against College of Charleston, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Georgetown in a race that saw the top four spots in the final rankings separated by only three points. Stokes and Wareham had more success against the Hoyas than their A-division counterparts, taking the tiebreaker, but fell short of first behind the Cougars and the Midshipmen.
“This past weekend showed us that we can definitely get a lot better,” sophomore Alma Lafler said. “But it also showed us that we’re one of the top teams out there. We’re going to make good use of the next couple of weeks of practice, and when nationals roll around, we’ll be ready.”
GEORGE MORRIS TROPHY
While the main focus for the Crimson was thousands of miles away in California, the team also competed on nearby waters in the George Morris Trophy, hosted by local rival Boston University.
Senior Colin Santangelo and freshman Sarah Pierson took 10th place in the A-division, while the B-division boat of sophomore Ryan Byrne and freshman Alice Kenney took 11th place.
“There were a couple of little things that we needed to take notice of, like the shifts in the water,” Santangelo said. “We had a good weekend, a lot of good races but a couple of bad ones, and those were what proved to be the difference.”
With spots in the women’s and dinghy championships secured, the next task ahead for Harvard is to achieve the same success for the team racing squad, as it competes in the 62nd New England Team Race/Fowle Trophy for a spot in the Team Racing National Championships.
“With only three spots for qualifiers, the racing this week is going to be tough,” Lafler said. “There’s a lot of really good NEISA teams, but we’re just as good. With all of the practice we’re going to put into team racing this week, we’ll be good to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quite possibly one of the greatest athletes to grace the Harvard football and baseball fields, Orville Frantz was one of the most likable and most controversial figures in history to play for the Crimson.
Frantz’s story is one of a student-athlete who went far beyond the books and athletics both prior to his stint in Cambridge and after his departure.
Upon his arrival in Cambridge from the small town of Wellington, Kansas, Frantz took up baseball and football, immediately becoming one of the premier players for the Crimson.
“They nicknamed him ‘Home run Frantz’ because he was known for his power and ability to hit the ball so well,” said Orville’s cousin Dr. Harry Frantz, Jr. “He was evidently pretty good throughout his entire career at Harvard.”
Due to the fact that Crimson athletes couldn’t participate in varsity athletics until they were seniors, Frantz played in the inter-class competitions against Harvard’s sophomores, juniors, and senior baseball players, ending the year victorious in the annual Class Championships.
In his sophomore season, he led Harvard to an 18-2 record and became a budding star first baseman for the Crimson. Frantz soon quit playing football because of his academic and extracurricular commitments to the Christian Association, the Class Debating Club, the Delta Upsilon, and the Hasty Pudding Club.
He became one of the most popular guys on campus due to his involvement in extracurricular activities, especially sports, and he influenced the George Emerson Lowell committee so much that they awarded him their scholarship, even with his “C” average.
By the time he reached his final year at Harvard, he had accomplished more as a student-athlete than many individuals that had come before him.
But then controversy hit. In his senior season of baseball, Frantz was disqualified from playing, forcing his class team to win the Class Championships without its best player.
Like many other Harvard students, Frantz went to school a few years after he graduated from high school, but in Orville’s case he was playing baseball in a league back home.
The Crimson coaches found out that eight years prior to his involvement with the Crimson, he was paid a mere $36 and expenses for playing in Wellington, Kansas.
“36 dollars doesn’t seem like a lot of money to this generation, but benefits are benefits,” said Phil Dawkins, a host of the Harvard Law School Symposium on Amateurism. “In this day and age a person can get in trouble with their school for just getting a ride from a coach, much less pay for play.”
In today’s world of athletics, the stratification of athletes that have been disqualified for violating amateur codes has become somewhat antagonistic, but the relationship between the Crimson and Frantz was anything but divisive.
“Many controversies have come up over the years since the Frantz incident like the Fab Five, the recent USC incidents and the issue of major pay at TCU and other football programs,” Dawkins said. “Now universities are trying to protect themselves from controversy by being progressive.”
After graduation, Frantz was accepted to Harvard Law School even with his average grades and hired as the head baseball coach for the Crimson.
He quickly lost interest in law and moved to Oklahoma City to continue his family’s lands and investments firm, The Frantz Company, and went on to become private secretary to his brother Frank Frantz who was personally appointed as governor of Oklahoma by their college friend and President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Orville Frantz was selected for the Varsity Hall of Fame even with his dismissal from the Crimson, illustrating his overwhelming acceptance at Harvard and the changes that have happened with amateurism over the years.
“The future of collegiate sports is up in the air with the huge debates between paying players or some how giving them benefits as amateurs,” Dawkins said. “Frantz might have been a pioneer in the early beginnings of something that has become so much bigger with regard the relation between money, athletics and the university.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winning may be the norm for Harvard heavyweight crew, but even by the Crimson’s impeccably high standards, this season has been something special. Every boat is currently undefeated in its spring season.
“We have a lot of depth this year,” junior six-seat Nick Jordan said. “We have a lot of big classes that have remained really tight so people enjoy coming out to practice and putting work in together, it really contributes to the whole.”
The team is ranked third in the country and is currently seeded first in the EARC poll. Sitting just behind Harvard in both rankings is Princeton. The men got a look at the Tigers earlier this season at the Compton Cup where they handed Princeton its only loss of the season so far.
It was still Harvard’s closest race of the season. The first varsity eight won by only 1.2 seconds. The Tigers held a two-to-three seat lead until the final 300 meters when Crimson won with a strong sprint.
“I think the boat really just clicked at that point,” junior stroke Pat Lapage said. “We really came together and we probably had our best race. It was pretty fast and lot of back and forth, but we pulled it out in the end.”
The Crimson’s success on the water this season has not been handed to it. It is the product of hours of hard work, team chemistry, coaching and determination.
But the team had to adapt to rowing on the water quickly when winter conditions kept the team on land until March.
“It gelled fairly early on but there are always small technical details that you need to iron out,” Lapage said. “You always feel like there’s something to work on… but that just comes down to rowing with each other and getting everything just right.”
Good coaching doesn’t hurt either.
Head coach Harry Parker is somewhat of a legend in the world of crew. Since taking control of the Harvard team in the 1960s, Parker has transformed it into one of the most successful programs in the country and revolutionized crew, all while coaching multiple Olympic teams.
“Our coach does a really good job of keeping things simple and competitive” Jordan said. “And the attitude to really push yourselves and be stubborn is infections when you get everyone involved.”
“Harry takes the best of everyone’s style and…gets rid of the other stuff,” added junior three seat Mike DiSanto.
One factor for the success might be the excellent international recruiting that has gone into building up this team. Although crew is stereotypically an international sport, this team is particularly well represented with members from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the United States all rowing in one boat. DiSanto is the only current member of the 1V to have gone to high school on this side of the Atlantic ocean.
“It’s a pretty diverse group all in the same boat,” Jordan said. “But considering the amount of time that you put into rowing ... you tend to bond pretty quickly no matter where the person next to you is from.”
“More than anything we all have the same goal,” DiSanto added. “Harry knows this and we’re willing to do whatever he tells us too.”
And right now that goal is clear. Win Sprints. After that, the team will turn its focus to its traditional race with Yale then the IRA National Championships. All three races will take place after the school year has ended.
“We’re just bucking down for Sprints now,” Lapage said. “And we’re looking to get the rowing just right.”
“We still have the sprints and nationals ahead of us,” Jordan added. “And all the boats are in the top couple seeds for eastern sprints now.”
Last year Harvard secured first place at the Sprints and went on to take fourth at the IRA National Championships. This year’s team is confident that it is ready to improve on that achievement.
“Everyone in the boat is much stronger than we were last season,” DiSanto said. “And I think we’re still trying to harness all the energy and all the power that’s in the boat. I think we’ve had some good races but the best is still yet to come ... I can speak for the varsity and say that we’ve haven’t yet reached our best races.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a year ago, senior Jordan Diekema was finishing up his third year on the swim team and his younger sister, sophomore Courtney Diekema, was completing her rookie season on the women’s soccer squad.
But how things have changed in the past year.
Now, Jordan has taken up club cycling, and his sister has moved from Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium to the Charles River.
It wasn’t until Courtney suffered a foot injury towards the end of the spring season that the thought of not playing soccer ever crossed her mind.
“I had planned on playing soccer through all four years until last spring,” Courtney said. “But now I have a chronic foot problem, a broken bone in my foot, and soccer isn’t really conducive to that.”
Last summer, with encouragement from her mother, Courtney took a crash course in rowing and learned the basics of crew. She then began emailing coaches, who expressed interest, and she walked onto Radcliffe heavyweight crew in the fall.
For Jordan, the decision to join cycling came even later. He had been out for all of the 2009-2010 swim season with health problems and was unsure whether he would continue swimming until last September.
“I just needed something different,” Jordan said. “Coming up after a season of inactivity was kind of brutal, so it was time to do something that I was just going to have fun with. I had been riding for years, but I’d never raced before until the fall. It was a new experience but it’s been going really well.”
Despite being faced with an unexpected transition, the Diekemas have been able to make the shift to a new sport quickly and smoothly. This is especially true with Jordan’s move from a varsity team to a club team, as the former requires much more time than the latter.
“Because cycling’s a club sport there’s a lot less organization and a lot less of what they can require of you,” Jordan said. “It’s more self-motivated, more on my clock, and it’s nice to be in a little bit more control.”
But the more free time and fewer required practices do not mean that club cycling is easier than varsity swimming.
“At the same time, it’s harder to motivate yourself and get up out of bed because you don’t have to do it necessarily,” Jordan added.
For Courtney, the transition has been more of the opposite.
“There is definitely a lot more time commitment with crew than with soccer,” she said.
But for her, it is time well spent, evident from her win in this weekend’s race at the Beanpot regatta and her invitation to row this summer with a U-23 Pre-Elite camp.
Jordan has had success in his new sport as well, as he is currently preparing for nationals while pursuing the opportunity to race for a U-23 triathlon development team once he is out of college.
But looking at the rest of the Diekema family, it’s no wonder where Courtney and Jordan get their athleticism.
The siblings’ father, Jeff Diekema, is a member of the Central Michigan University Athletic Hall of Fame and coached the Wellesley swim team for a year. Their siblings’ mother coached a high school team, and their older sister, Megan, was a swimmer at Calvin College.
“Swimming was inevitable for us,” Jordan said.
Even Courtney swam until the end of her freshman year of high school.
“The coach told me I’d have to quit soccer if I wanted to keep swimming,” Courtney said. “So I quit swimming to play soccer.”
“He told me the same thing, but I actually listened to him,” Jordan added.
At Harvard, sports continue to be a huge part of Courtney and Jordan’s life, just as they were while the two were living at home in Michigan.
All of Jordan’s roommates joined the swim team freshmen year, and Courtney lives and remains close with her friends from the soccer team.
“When you’re on a team you spend all that time with your teammates so you don’t necessarily get out that group very often,” Jordan said. “It’s nice now to be on the cycling team because I have a different group I can associate with while still having my group from the swim team.”
“I feel like if I ever needed anything, there’s definitely someone on my team who is willing and can help,” Courtney added. “And so now I have double resources—soccer and crew—which means a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students prepare for final tests, so too do Ivy League sports teams. After last weekend’s action, we finally know the playoff pictures in baseball, softball, and men’s and women’s lacrosse. The playoff action for all four sports begins this weekend, and by this time next week, we’ll have a whole new set of Ivy League champs. So come on, put down those books, as we take a trip through the Ivies in this week’s edition of Around the Water Cooler. 
The Harvard baseball team’s season began poorly.  This weekend, it ended poorly as well, as Dartmouth easily swept the Crimson in a four-game series. While Harvard managed to keep it close in the final game of the weekend, the Crimson couldn’t get anything going earlier in the series. In the first three contests, Harvard combined for two run, while the Big Green managed to score 13 times.
While the Crimson had already been mathematically eliminated from the Ivy League hunt before this weekend, the games mattered for Dartmouth, which held a tie for first-place with Yale in the Red Rolfe Division coming into the series. But a Dartmouth sweep combined with a poor showing by the Bulldogs against Brown gave the Big Green the division title and a berth into the Ivy League Championship Series.
Dartmouth will face off against Lou Gehrig Division champion Princeton, which sealed the division crown this weekend after beating Cornell three times in four games. The Tigers will host the best-of-three series, which begins this Saturday.
While the Harvard baseball finished in the cellar of the Ivy League, the softball counterpart fared much better. With a league record of 18-2, Harvard is easily the best team in the Ancient Eight, seven games ahead of the next-best squad.  After easily winning the North Division for the second-straight year, Harvard has home-field advantage in this weekend’s Ivy League Championship Series against the South Division Champion, Cornell. The series is a rematch of last year’s championship, but most expect a different outcome in 2011 than in 2010, when the Big Red came out on top.
In men’s lacrosse, Harvard was on the brink of qualifying for the Ivy League Tournament coming into last weekend. But, the team controlled its destiny: if Harvard beat Yale, then the Crimson was in. The boys from Cambridge did just what they needed to, beating the Bulldogs 9-5 at Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Now, the Crimson will head to Ithaca, NY, where top-seeded Cornell hosts the tournament.  Third-seeded Harvard will face off against second-seeded Penn on Friday, while the Big Red and fourth-seeded Yale play later that night. The winners of the two contests will meet on Sunday in the league championship game.
Before this past Friday, we knew the four women’s lacrosse teams that would make the women’s Ivy League Tournament: Penn, Princeton, Harvard, and Dartmouth. We also knew that Penn would be hosting. It was just a question of whether Dartmouth or Harvard would be seeded higher, as both came in to Friday’s matchup with identical 5-1 league records. From the beginning, Dartmouth held the upper hand and coasted to an easy 14-7 victory. That’s bad news for Harvard, as the two teams will meet up again this weekend in the first round of the Ivy League Tournament.

Trying to get rid of an old futon? Just got a housing upgrade and need to fill that extra space? Normally the process of buying and selling used furniture is a pain, but fortunately the website Harvard Sells is back in time to make the senior sale season a much more organized experience.
The site, founded last year by Keito Uchiyama '11, features numerous items for sale: chairs, lamps, old clothes, and even Victoria's Secret body spray. Harvard Sells aims to give students the opportunity to buy and sell from people in the same community while offering a level of security and trust lacking in other sites.
 
"It's rewritten and completely new," Uchiyama said. "I wanted to make it easy to buy and sell [used items]." He said he was inspired to make and revamp the site after noticing that Facebook albums and emails were inefficient. 
 
Sellers can go to the website and import their senior sale Facebook album. The site will find the prices from the descriptions, and the seller can choose whether they want to sell at a fixed price or auction off their item.
 
Potential buyers can browse the site and find items that interest them. If it's being sold at a fixed price, they can simply contact the seller, whose email is listed in the item description. If it's an auction, buyers can bid up on the item until the auction is over—a process similar to eBay's auction system.
 
"I'd like people to experience for themselves the fun of auctions," Uchiyama said.
