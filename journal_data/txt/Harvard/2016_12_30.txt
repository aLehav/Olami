After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 30, 2016 at 6:32 p.m. 
Harvard student union organizers filed an objection Thursday to a November election that could determine whether or not eligible students can form a union, arguing that the University may have prevented eligible voters from participating.
Further complicating an election process marred by a delayed and initially inconclusive vote count, the objection filing charges that the voter list the University provided for the election may have excluded hundreds of eligible voters, according to a post on the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers’ Facebook page. The objection could ultimately prompt a new vote on whether or not eligible students at Harvard can unionize.
Harvard has also filed an objection to the election, albeit one very different in scope. The University’s filing focuses on a single vote that was not counted because the voter wrote on the ballot, according to Harvard spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven. The University contends that the NLRB should count the vote.
The NLRB will conduct hearings on the objections next month, and could call for a revote in an election whose results have already been delayed due to questions of voter eligibility. William B. Gould, a Stanford Law professor who was the chair of the NLRB from 1994 to 1998, wrote in an email that “the goal of objections is to get the election set aside and this will generally mean a new election.”
The objections come after an initial vote count in the unionization election, held Nov. 16 and 17, indicated that more eligible students had voted against unionization than in support of it, with 1,456 opposing votes and 1,272 in support. But because the number of ballots under challenge remains greater than the margin of votes deciding the election, the election remains too close to call and the NLRB will hold hearings to determine the eligibility of those ballots.
The union organizers charge that Harvard’s decision to list “preferred names”—as opposed to full legal names printed on IDs—meant that the printed names did not always match the names on the lists of eligible voters, preventing certain students from casting votes.
“As many saw at the polls during the election, Harvard failed to provide an accurate list,” organizers wrote in a post on the union effort’s Facebook page. “Hundreds of student workers were left off the eligible voter list provided by the employer to the NLRB in advance of the election, leading to confusion about who was eligible to vote.”
Responding to the union organizers’ objection, Cowenhoven wrote in a statement the union’s challenge was not “surprising” because a majority of the votes that have been counted were against student unionization.
“The University and the HGSU-UAW reached an election agreement to define the eligible voters prior to the vote, and the University worked diligently to develop that voter list,” she wrote. “Our shared goal was and is to count every eligible vote.”
Union organizers’ concerns about the list of eligible voters are not new. Union organizers have previously said they alerted Harvard to naming issues with the voter list before the election, although a University administrator stated that Harvard learned of the issue on the first day of the election.
Robert P. Redbord, Boston’s Deputy Regional Attorney for the NLRB, could not be reached for comment.
Disagreements about voter eligibility have already delayed the results of the election for weeks. During the election, about 1,200 ballots were challenged, and the parties spent weeks sifting through roughly 900 of the challenged ballots. But 314 ballots remain under challenge, and the NLRB will conduct hearings to determine the voters’ eligibility.
Both Harvard and the union organizers filed their objections seven days after the vote count, the last day possible under NLRB procedures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the team’s second appearance in the Fordham Holiday Classic, the Harvard women’s basketball team has again advanced to the championship game with its 79-61 victory over UNC Asheville at the Rose Hill Gymnasium in The Bronx, N.Y.
With the win, the Crimson (10-1) improves its win streak to 10 games, its longest since a 12-game win streak during the 2006-07 season. The streak also makes for the best 11-game start in program history. For the first quarter though, the continuation of this streak did not look likely.
In the first ever meeting of the two programs, the Bulldogs (6-4) scored the first points of the game and continued to hold the lead throughout the majority of the first quarter until junior guard Taylor Rooks made a putback shot to put Harvard up 10-9 with 3:22 left in the quarter. The first would end as the lowest-scoring quarter of the game for either team at 12-11 in favor of the Crimson.
With the game standing at 20-19 three minutes into the second quarter, a three-pointer by freshman guard Katie Benzan put Harvard up four and catalyzed a 10-0 Crimson run. The team would never look back.
“In the second quarter, we found our rhythm,” Benzan said. “Our ball movement was hard to defend. We were making UNC Asheville move from side to side on defense.”
Sailing into halftime up 37-27, Harvard outscored its opponent in both second half quarters, 22-14 in the third, and 20-12 in the fourth.
“When we are sharing the ball, we just have too many threats so it's hard to guard us,” Benzan said. “Plus we made some defensive adjustments. We knew how UNC Asheville wanted to attack so we were able to adjust and stop them.”
Freshman forward Jeannie Boehm proved a dominating force at the boards, leading the team in rebounds, picking up 10 to go along with 14 points. The game represented her third career triple-double.
Rebounds have proved to be an advantage for the young team. Only once this season has the Crimson been outrebounded. Prior to the tournament, the team ranked 19th in the nation for rebounds per game with 44.8 and 22nd in rebound margin with a mark of +10.4. Against UNC Asheville, Harvard outrebounded the Bulldogs, 47-37.
“We make rebounding a priority, whether it's in practice or in games,” Boehm said. “It's something we have worked hard at and improved since the beginning of the season. Having an advantage in rebounding allows us limit the other team to only one shot per possession, as well as push the ball in transition.”
Benzan led the team assists, with seven, and in points, with 16. She was followed closely by Boehm with 14, and senior forward Destiny Nunley with 10. Benzan also led in three-pointers, picking up four on the night. The guard currently leads the team with 31, while the Crimson offense continues to rank near the top nationally for shots beyond the arc. Prior to Thursday’s match-up, the team averaged 8.2 per game and a three-point percentage of 37.1, 31st and 35th in the NCAA, respectively. Against the Bulldogs, Harvard made eight of its 19 attempts.
Bench points played a large factor in the success of the Crimson offense as well. Harvard’s bench outscored UNC Asheville’s, 31-13. Coming into the game for the Crimson after the whistle was Rooks with 10 points, sophomore guard Nani Redford with nine, and sophomore guard Sydney Skinner with eight of her own.
Harvard will play in the tournament’s championship game tomorrow against Buffalo (10-0). The Bulls have set a program record with a 10-game win streak to start the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a four-week recess, college hockey’s winter intermission is finally over. Tonight, the second half of the season gets underway as the Harvard men’s hockey team takes on Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center (7 p.m.).
LOOKING BACK AT THE FIRST HALF
Already having exceeded some early expectations, the Crimson (8-2-1, 4-1-1 ECAC) currently ranks fourth in both the PairWise rankings and the national polls. Harvard’s offense has been a powerful force, averaging one goal more than it did a year ago when Hobey Baker winner Jimmy Vesey was leading the charge. Generating 4.45 goals per game, the Crimson is third in the country in scoring and second in goal differential per game.
Meanwhile, six different Harvard skaters head into the second half averaging at least a point a game. Only Ohio State, who ranks second in the country in scoring, has more. Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, freshman defenseman Adam Fox, and senior forward Tyler Moy in particular all rank among the top 15 in the nation in points per game.
All three also feature heavily on the Crimson power play unit, which has converted at a nation-best rate of 30.6 percent. Since a disappointing 2-for-17 showing on the man advantage over its first four league games, Harvard remarkably has netted at least two power play goals in four of its last five contests.
REPLACING THE FOX
To say Adam Fox has been an integral part of the Crimson power play would be an understatement. During Harvard’s recent special teams tear, Fox has picked up a point on seven of the Crimson’s last nine power play goals. He’s also earned a point on two-thirds of all Harvard's power play tallies this season.
Yet Friday night against RPI (3-16-1, 1-9-0), the Crimson will be without its star D-man, who is currently playing for Team USA at the World Junior Championships in Canada. Furthermore, if the United States advances as far as the semifinals, the Stars and Stripes will play their final game on Jan. 5, leaving Fox’s availability for Harvard's clash with No. 14/13 Quinnipiac on Jan. 6 in question.
Normally, Fox skates alongside sophomore Jacob Olson on the Crimson's second defensive unit, but with the rookie out, it remains to be seen what pairings Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 will roll out tonight. The first pairing of junior Wiley Sherman and freshman John Marino should remain untouched, and one of two sophomores—Adam Baughman and Viktor Dombrovskiy—will likely start across from senior Clay Anderson on another pairing. But between the odd man out and Olson, Donato may only be able to suit up one. Baughman, Dombrovskiy, and Olson are all left-handed, meaning there’s a reasonable chance Donato could alternatively call on right-handed junior Thomas Aiken to make his season debut.
FAULTY ENGINEERING
All things considered, if there’s one game Harvard can likely afford to play without a key contributor, it’s this one. A year removed from an 18-win season, RPI has been dreadful. The Engineers have won just three of their first 20 games and only one out of their 10 league games. They’ve scored 2.20 goals per contest while surrendering 3.95, the sixth- and third-worst averages in all of college hockey, respectively.
RPI wasn’t expected to be a real conference contender, but no one anticipated a downward spiral of this magnitude. The Engineers were picked to finish eighth in the ECAC at the start of the year by the league’s coaches and seventh by the media. Yet without graduated goaltender Jason Kasdorf, who posted the ninth-best save percentage in the country a year ago (.931), the Engineers have dug themselves into a last-place pit.
Nonetheless, RPI has given a few teams runs for their money. In fact, while on the road, the Engineers took Princeton, a team that has recently been on the rise, and first-place Union to overtime.
Additionally, the RPI offense came up with at least three goals in each of its final three contests prior to the winter stoppage. And just this week, Engineers coach Seth Appert said that he likes how his team has looked in its latest practices coming off break.
But even so, the records don’t lie: Harvard is the better team in this matchup by a long shot. Of course anything can happen in hockey, especially in games that follow lengthy layovers. But anything short of a win by the hosts would be a real surprise, perhaps the last one of 2016 within the world of college hockey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team will play its final game of 2016 when it hosts Howard on Friday evening at Lavietes Pavilion (7:00 PM, Ivy League Digital Network). Harvard (5-4) has won its last four contests while the Bison (3-10) has dropped its last two. The Crimson made a trip to Washington, D.C. last season over Martin Luther King, Jr. Weekend to take on Howard at historic Burr Gymnasium and visit the MLK Memorial. Harvard took last season’s matchup, 69-61. Men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason highlights three things to watch in Friday’s contest.
ROAD STRUGGLES
By playing the nation’s ninth-hardest schedule as ranked by Pomeroy College Basketball Ratings, the Bison has had to play eight of its first 11 contests away from Burr Gymnasium. Unfortunately for Howard, road gyms and Division I opponents in general have not been too friendly to the Bison. Howard is 0-8 on the road, with its only win against a Division I opponent coming at Burr Gymnasium against American on Dec. 3. The Bison is 0-8 on the road and has been outscored by an average of nearly 25 points per contest. Howard has dropped its last 11 road contests, with its last win coming against Delaware State on Jan. 11. The Crimson is 3-2 at home and has won its last two contests in Cambridge.
HOLLYWOOD ENDING?
This year’s Bison team is being profiled in a documentary by The Undefeated, a sports website owned by ESPN, entitled View from the Hilltop. Howard is looking to make its first NCAA Tournament since 1992. Junior guard James Miller has been a bright spot on a veteran team. So far, however, the team has taken more than its fair share of lumps to begin the season. Harvard will avoid facing James Daniel for the second consecutive season. Daniel was the nation’s leading scorer when the Crimson traveled to the nation’s capital last January. Daniel, last season’s MEAC Player of the Year and this season’s MEAC Player of the Year pick in the preseason, has yet to appear in a game this season due to an ankle injury. Howard has struggled mightily in Daniel’s absence. The Bison is only averaging 61.6 points per game while shooting 39.2 percent from the field and 32.1 percent from three-point range. The most eye-opening stat for Howard, however, may be that it only averages 7.8 assists per contest on the offensive end. For context, Harvard co-captain Siyani Chambers averages 7.6 assists by himself while only playing 32.1 minutes a game. Like the Ivy League, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference figures to only get one team into the NCAA Tournament. While the Bison has struggled to begin the season, all would be forgotten if Howard catches fire once it begins its conference slate next Wednesday.
COMING IN HOT
The Crimson has won its last four contests, including road wins against Houston and Boston College. Despite shooting just 31.6 percent from the field, Harvard found a way to beat the Cougars last Friday night as freshman point guard Bryce Aiken took over in the second half. If good teams always find a way to win, the Crimson looked like a good team its last time out. Harvard has won each of its last four games in different fashions—taking a defensive battle against Fordham, shooting the lights out against Northeastern, dominating the paint against BC, and winning an ugly game against Houston. Unlike last season in which Harvard’s whole team seemed to go into slumps at the same time, the Crimson’s freshmen have provided an offensive spark for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, one the Crimson may not need against Howard but surely will come Ivy League play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With four weeks having elapsed since the Harvard men’s hockey team last took the ice, some rust was to be expected from the Crimson in its return to action Friday night, especially early on.
That turned out not to be the case. Instead, the opening six minutes saw Harvard fire 11 shots on goal, the last of which gave the Crimson its first lead of the season’s second stanza. And that edge would not be erased, as No. 4 Harvard (9-2-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) led throughout in a 5-1 victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
