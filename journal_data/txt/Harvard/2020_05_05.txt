After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Swati, take care of yourself. You are in the United States these days. I wish you were here right now.”
Did I hear that correctly? That was my younger sister Divya calling from India. Back home, the entire country has been under complete lockdown since March 25. Her warning got me thinking: Am I in the wrong place at the wrong time? To be in the U.S. now is worrisome for my people in India.
Where is the might of the United States, considered a global leader on many fronts? What does this bitter COVID-19 pill tell us about our combined failure to respond in a timely fashion to so many warning signs? Why did we ignore the worst-case scenario?
I tried responding to Divya saying, “I am fine. We are home, following social distancing norms. Schools are closed so even kids are at home. We all exercise daily and take care of our diets.” But, she was not satisfied, worried about me and my two children. She spoke. I listened. She submerged me under a barrage of facts and figures on the number of confirmed cases, number of deaths, preventive steps to be taken. She rattled off the missteps of the U.S. government in not making decisions fast enough and now talking about re-opening the economy too soon. She shared data not only concerning the U.S. but almost every country in the world. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was looking at the “worldometer” data while talking to me.
I did not contradict or argue with her. I was silent. She meant well for me and my family. We hung up but only after I assured her many times that “even” though I was in the U.S., I would take care and be mindful of the medical and advisory guidelines.
She left me wondering and in deep reflection as she always does. Her fear and worry about my presence in the U.S. and not in India gave me much food for thought.
As is my wont, I don’t compare countries’ statistics on COVID-19, and so I restrain myself here. I believe that comparisons don’t help — only causing anxiety and panic. I am certain that each nation has to be well for everyone else to be well.
Deaths anywhere are never happy news.
Divya’s phone call forced me to take a fresh perspective on our long-held beliefs about the “successful” nations and their global status. Our definitions of developed and developing countries are being challenged. Everyone is wide-eyed with surprise at the growing number of confirmed COVID cases in the U.S.
Is this microscopic pathogen teaching us a tough but honest lesson?
I believe we all made COVID-19 successful because as nations, we were overconfident in our individual strengths and capabilities; we put our governments in ruthless competition, and focused more on comparative advantages and progress but less on global cooperation and coordination. How could we fail to recognize that what began in China would cross all man-made boundaries irrespective of our regional affiliations? How could we forget that we are chained together in this globalized world? Any weak link hurts the full chain.
What governments worldwide could not do for so long, COVID-19 did. It very effectively brought the critical agenda of global solidarity to the forefront: the strengthening of worldwide health infrastructure, the global sharing of resources, the combining of medical expertise and data, and the principle of collaboration rather than competition. It highlighted how nations’ bulging defense budgets could not be utilized to protect people from the deadly coronavirus. It showed how we, the proud adults, failed our children.
COVID-19 has changed the world forever. It has written new pages in world history. There will not be any mention of the sufferings of the vulnerable and the poor without a full chapter on leadership failure. Trade rivalry between the two economic powerhouses that captured headlines not long ago is of little consequence when the doors of these nations are closed and their economies are breathing heavily. Leadership will not be understood the way we saw it earlier. Technological and economic prowess could not stand strong before a minuscule virus that revealed our vulnerabilities cruelly and ruthlessly.
It is high time we pause to correct course and join hands in fighting this global menace by leading from the front. We need to rethink the public health measures and prepare ourselves for a long haul by being resilient. It is time we show to our children that true leaders respond and act in unison when tough times call. This unique crisis needs unity of purpose.
Mahatma Gandhi’s emphasis on collective action and a shared common destiny has never been truer than it is today.
The hard fact remains. COVID-19’s success is a testament to our collective failure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In February 2006, financier Jeffrey E. Epstein applied to renew his Visiting Fellow status at Harvard. Epstein — a prominent Harvard donor with no educational qualifications for the psychology fellowship he sought renewal for — argued that he wanted to continue his studies on power, reputation, and deception. The application was approved — then, months before classes started, he was asked to withdraw, though not without a full refund. The would-be fellow had been charged for sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl. His complete estrangement from Harvard appeared imminent and unavoidable.
But it wasn’t.
Over a decade later — after yet another set of sex offense charges and Epstein’s death in jail — a review of the University’s ties to the disgraced financier reveals the extent to which our institution was actively complicit in Epstein’s pattern of abuse. It betrays the influence of power, reputation, and wealth, even within academic institutions that profess to be committed to truth and the nurturing of young people.
By 2011, Epstein registered as a sex offender in New York, deemed to pose “a high risk of repeat offense and a threat to public safety.” His widely criticized plea deal allowed him to serve just 13 months in prison under lax conditions, but the nature of his depravity was widely known since 2006.
Yet between 2010 and 2018, Epstein enjoyed a privileged position at Harvard. He held the keys to a private office on campus (complete with a Harvard University phone line), where he had meetings set up with Harvard academics upon his request. In 2014, following a request made by Epstein's publicist to boost his image, Epstein was granted his own page on Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics website; a link was also set up to Epstein’s foundation website, which featured fraudulent claims about his philanthropy. He visited our institution over 40 times and as recently as 2018, frequently accompanied by female assistants who “appeared to be” in their 20s, and sat in on at least one undergraduate class — all while Epstein’s serial sexual abuse of minors, most of whom were 13 to 16 years old, was public knowledge.
The University has placed Mathematics and Biology professor Martin A. Nowak, head of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, on administrative leave. Rightly so. Nowak facilitated much of Epstein’s association with the University. But he was hardly alone.
A particularly revealing footnote in the University’s report concedes that several faculty members traveled in Epstein’s planes and visited him while he was serving time in jail. More concerningly, the report specifically references faculty visits to Epstein’s private enclave in the Virgin Islands, which has been credibly accused of harboring the trafficking and abuse of girls as young as 11 until 2018.
While Harvard professors can interact with whomever they please, pursuing such trips suggests, at the very least, an extremely concerning lapse in basic moral judgment, and we should judge them accordingly. Relegating that information to a footnote reveals the extent to which Harvard has not only failed to mount sufficient moral criticism but perhaps failed to acknowledge the significance of these relationships.
So why was a convicted sex offender allowed to parade around campus? Why did so many of our faculty indulge him? The answer is depressingly predictable: money. Epstein leveraged his financial contributions to gain access and influence among Harvard faculty members. The philanthropic sex offender donated over $9 million to University programs, including over $700,000 after his 2006 arrest. That amount bought him access to prominent professors, Harvard relationships that would survive his convictions, and an unearned fellowship.
The Epstein report reveals that Harvard served as a powerful platform for a sex offender to pay for a reputation retouch. And the willingness to do so wasn’t limited to Professor Nowak; a culture of complicity pervaded — from Harvard staff who continued to invite Epstein to University events, to Harvard faculty such as Math Department Chair Benedict H. “Dick” Gross ‘71, who considered it “ideal” to continue to seek Epstein’s money — all years after Epstein’s pedophilia was known. Punishing Nowak is certainly necessary, but pretending that he was the only source of the problem is nothing but a deflection of responsibility.

Harvard will begin a “phased” reopening of its research labs through the oversight of a new Lab Reopening Planning Committee, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an email to Harvard faculty Monday.
Though Garber called the need to resume research operations “urgent,” he wrote that reopening will happen gradually and only in accordance with public health guidelines. Harvard’s labs were drastically scaled down two months ago — with the exception of essential activities — in response to the global coronavirus pandemic.
Vice Provost for Research Richard D. McCullough formed the reopening committee at Garber’s request in collaboration with Dean of Science Christopher J. Stubbs, according to the email. In cooperation with local and state leaders, the committee — which is composed of Harvard faculty and staff as well as outside experts — will develop protocols for personal protection and testing in labs as well as guidelines for modifying research spaces to prevent spread of infection.
“It will base its decisions in data and draw on insights from epidemiology, engineering, medicine, laboratory science, decision sciences, and ethics and the law,” Garber wrote. “With the committee’s guidance, we will monitor the success of the phased reopening and be prepared to make changes as dictated by health and safety issues.”
The group will also draw from protocols developed in Harvard labs that have remained operational during the pandemic — namely, those dedicated to COVID-19 research.
“We can build on the experience of the laboratories dedicated to COVID-19 research that have continued to operate safely during the pandemic, along with the experience of laboratories in our affiliated institutes and hospitals, as well as other institutions, that have resumed work,” he wrote.
The University is also preparing for the reopening of research access to Harvard’s libraries and museums. He wrote that “infection control measures” will be adapted to meet the features of the University’s libraries and museums.
“Staff need to return to these facilities to be able to provide the full complement of virtual research services and to satisfy requests for physical materials needed for scholarship,” he wrote. “As in the laboratories, health and safety is of paramount importance, so infection control measures will be adapted for the distinctive features of libraries and museums.”
The efforts will be led by Vice President for the Harvard Library and University Librarian Martha Whitehead, Director of the Harvard Art Museums Martha Tedeschi.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Police Superintendent Jack Albert apologized on Monday evening for sending an inadvertent message on the department’s Twitter account which called Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) a “jerk” and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) a “clown.”
Albert’s tweet, which has since been deleted, criticized Kennedy for his comment that the distribution of personal protection equipment in the U.S. was “embarrassing.”
“Another liberal fucking jerk who just happens to be better than the clown he’s running against. Sad for us,” Albert tweeted Sunday afternoon in reference to Kennedy’s bid to unseat Markey this fall.
After CPD issued an apology on Sunday denouncing the political commentary as “inappropriate, unprofessional and disrespectful,” Albert issued an additional statement Monday taking responsibility for the tweet.
He called his actions “regrettable” and directed his apology to Kennedy, Markey, the city of Cambridge, and CPD affiliates.
“Unfortunately, in a moment of heated political debate with friends, I posted commentary that was out of character and not something I am proud of,” Albert wrote. “I — not the department — deserve the criticism that has been directed to the Police Department over the last 24 hours.”
Albert wrote he recognized the severity of the incident was exacerbated by his executive position and long history at the department.
“As a 32-year-member of the Cambridge Police Department, and someone who grew up in the City of Cambridge, I know the high standards the Cambridge Police are expected to uphold in the community,” he wrote. “Those expectations are rightfully heightened with someone in my executive position – on and off-duty.”
As CPD officers take precautions to limit the spread of the virus and prioritize the safety of Cambridge residents, Albert said he regrets that his profanity-laced tweet may have detracted from the department’s battle against the coronavirus pandemic.
“During this unprecedented time and COVID-19, my colleagues at the Cambridge Police Department have been doing extraordinary work supporting and protecting our residents,” Albert said. “To detract from their exemplary efforts because of my poor lapse in judgement is something that I will forever carry with me.”
Albert will face disciplinary action in accordance with department policy and procedures, CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email. However, because of Massachusetts General Laws, Warnick wrote CPD is restricted from disclosing Albert’s punishment to the public.
In response to Albert’s inadvertent tweet, CPD will restrict administrative access to its social media accounts to the Director of Communications and Media Relations, which Warnick holds. Previously, members of the CPD Command Staff, including deputy superintendents and superintendents could also access the official accounts.
Kennedy and Markey’s offices did not respond to requests for comment on the criticism.

Harvard will extend guaranteed pay and benefits to directly employed staff and contract workers through June 28 as it faces a $415 million shortfall this fiscal year, Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote in an email to Harvard faculty and staff Tuesday morning.
“We previously announced a financial commitment that we would guarantee pay and benefits through May 28th to our directly employed staff and contract workers, including those who provide dining, custodial, and security services, who are able to work, but experienced the disruption of idle work since the decision to reduce the population living on campus,” Lapp wrote. “Today, I want to share that we have decided to extend that guarantee of pay and benefits to those workers covered under this May 28th policy for an additional month, until June 28th.”
On March 27, Harvard guaranteed it would pay employees through May 28 who are able to work but unable to perform their regular duties due to the outbreak. The policy covers all Harvard employees including full-time, part-time, and contracted workers.
However, the policy does not extend to workers in the dining halls continuing to serve students, whose jobs still involve coming to work. Forty-three dining hall workers chose to take sick or personal leave because they are part of a high-risk group for COVID-19 or living with at-risk individuals.
The University has not been spared from the economic impact of the global pandemic, Lapp wrote — Harvard estimates it will lose $415 million this fiscal year. The University is also projecting a $750 million revenue shortfall for the fiscal year 2021, which begins July 1.
“This figure includes, among other things, refunding room and board for the last half of the semester and providing moving, travel, and other financial assistance to students who were required to depart campus,” Lapp wrote. “ It also includes the necessary step of cancelling in-person Continuing and Executive Education courses and programs, and the loss of funding from federal and non-federal sources due to the closure of labs.”
As a way to address these unprecedented costs, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced a University-wide hiring freeze, salary freeze, deferring or cancelling discretionary spending, a review of capital projects, and voluntary salary reductions for top University administrators on April 13.
“As we stated last month, given the magnitude of the financial losses the University has sustained and the projected loss of revenues, it is clear that additional cost saving measures will be needed in the coming months including the possibility of furloughs and layoffs of some members of our workforce,” Lapp wrote.
She added that whether Harvard will pursue furloughs, layoffs, and other cost-saving measures still remains unclear.
“We are trying to understand the extent to which some of our revenue loss is temporary versus permanent,” Lapp wrote. “While we have some capacity to absorb temporary losses, we must take the necessary steps in some areas to adjust to what is likely to be a new normal.”

Do you stare up at your ceiling at night, in your twin size bed, with your parents across the hall, and wonder if you’re reliving your old high school years, falling into the same habits? Maybe it’s the procrastination hole that you swore you’d never fall into again, the constant squabbles with your family, spending too much time in your room alone, spending all your time scrolling...and the list goes on. But how can you fight against falling into your old lifestyle and retain the growth you’ve gone through during college?
Rearrange Your Room to Redefine Yourself 
Rid yourself of any potential bad ju-ju by redefining your space. Maybe you want your room to represent your dorm more than your childhood bedroom, or maybe you want to go for a whole different vibe. Are the One Direction posters on the walls glaring down at you, and beckoning you to be a hormonal teen to your parents? While our love for One Direction is still as strong as ever, maybe we want to replace old posters with more updated décor. Before you hop on Amazon to get color-changing lights, look around your house to see if there’s anything you can repurpose, since all of your decorations are stored away in who knows where. If all else fails, move around your desk and give your space a whole new feel.
A New Schedule for a New Mindset 
Why stop at revamping your room? Redefine your values and your time by creating a new schedule for yourself — one not influenced by your high school habits. Maybe skip the normal two afternoon naps and opt for one instead. Or, make your new schedule align a bit more with your life at college. Even trying different snacks or changing up your sleeping habits (because we don’t need to be awake at 4 a.m.) can help refresh your time at home.
Limit Time Spent Listening to High School-Era Music 
Sure, listening to Lorde on your floor for nostalgia purposes is nice, but does it put you in the best headspace? If your music is bringing you down, change it up! Same goes for those CW shows we all loved (and still love) to watch. Maybe try watching the new Netflix show, “Never Have I Ever,” for an alternative perspective on high school life.
Carve out Some Personal Time 
You may not have had a lot of personal time at home during high school, but it might be time to put on your big-kid pants and let your parents and siblings know that you can’t be interrupted during your timed exam. Plus, you need time for yourself. It’s easy to forget that just a few weeks ago you were (for the most part) living an autonomous life. Engage in some ~mature~ conversation with your parents and come to an agreement so that you finally have some time to reflect on this whole situation.
Now that we’re not living with our pals and spending our nights in our childhood bedrooms instead of at late night food places, it’s hard to remember that we’re all in the same boat. This isolation’s got us all in a bit of a funk, but that doesn’t mean you should revert into your not-as-aware, or as-knowledgeable high school self. Approach old situations with a new mindset and remember that change is always possible.

With quarantine and shelter-in-place orders come lethargy and laziness. Getting out of bed becomes a massive challenge, and the lack of a fully equipped gym-space makes getting exercise even harder than usual. Eating double fudge brownies while swiping through semi-funny Zoom memes on the sofa is nice, but spending every afternoon this way may not be a recipe for long-term health and happiness (at least that’s what the doctors are saying, anyways). Turn over a new leaf and check out some Flyby-approved ways to stay at least a little active at home.
Interval Fitness
Interval fitness is perfect for when you’re binging a show or doing class assignments. Set a timer that goes off every 20 minutes or so, and go through a short circuit workout every time the alarm goes off (e.g. 20 pushups, 20 reverse crunches, 20 Supermans). If you’re watching TV with ads, even better: you don’t have to just sit around during the commercial breaks.
The One Punch Man Workout
If you are a weeb, then you know what’s up with this workout: complete this challenge and you’ll be looking like an absolute snack with the power to subdue anyone with your knuckles. For everyone else, it’s simple: complete 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, and 100 squats every day for as long as you can to achieve respectable fitness. You’re also supposed to run 10 km, but you can add that in when it’s safe to go outside again.
Resistance Bands
Building muscle doesn’t always have to involve heavy and expensive weights. Use the power of physics to train your body with resistance bands instead! Attach the bands to a doorway or your own body to facilitate pulldowns, extensions, curls, leg lifts, and so on. You can choose bands with varying resistance levels to gradually build up your strength.
Stair Sequences
Sick of body-weight exercises, but still hoping to keep your muscles from atrophying any further? Try walking up the stairs — it may sound boring, but it works on all your major lower-body muscles, from your glutes to your hamstrings. Start at the lowest point in your house, and walk yourself up to the top! Don’t forget to repeat many times for real progress.
So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this, get up, and work in a Flyby-approved home exercise to get the blood flowing and the mind racing!
