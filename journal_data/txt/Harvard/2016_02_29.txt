After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The observation that Uber, Lyft, and other ride-sharing companies are prime examples of the power of the innovative free market has by now become almost a cliché. Nevertheless, it remains true. As these new entrants to the transportation services world mature, however, lawmakers around the country are rightly asking whether more stringent consumer safety regulations are necessary. Some are also questioning whether economic regulations designed to keep taxis competitive might also help better define the market.
In light of recent events like an Uber driver allegedly murdering eight individuals in between rides in Kalamazoo, Mich. and charges of assault filed against an Uber driver in Boston, the need for further regulation of the ride-sharing industry is clear. This regulation, however, should be aimed at promoting the safety of passengers, not protecting taxis at the expense of ride-sharing services. Limiting this new and exciting market simply to preserve an aging industry would be counterintuitive.
A bill put forth by Governor Charlie D. Baker '79 in the Massachusetts legislature would address many of the safety gaps in the ride-sharing industry by increasing state oversight of background checks for drivers, as well as requiring companies to maintain higher and more consistent levels of insurance. Although some companies—such as Uber and Lyft—already require background checks, Governor Baker’s proposal would add an additional level of security supervised by the Commonwealth’s Department of Public Utilities. State Senator Linda Dorcena Forry and Representative Michael Moran have also presented a bill that would require fingerprinting as part of drivers’ background checks. We believe that all these proposals are reasonable changes that would help ensure the well being of passengers, while also safeguarding the continued innovation and development of these services.
Other elements of Forry and Moran’s bill, however, would likely stifle the competitiveness of ride-sharing companies and harm consumers. In particular, arbitrary limitations on the ability of ride-share drivers to operate at airports and on the age of their vehicles would inconvenience passengers and increase costs with negligible safety benefits. These outcomes would be particularly unfortunate given that the taxi industry has begun to rise to the challenge posed by ride-sharing companies. Rather than relying on measures like striking, taxis in the Greater Boston area are focusing on improving the efficiency and accessibility of their own services to increase competitiveness. One example is the new partnership with the ride-hailing app Curb to bring the convenience of Uber and Lyft to taxi customers. Innovations likes this one will only continue to improve service for all customers if policymakers allow competition to thrive.
Their success notwithstanding, one area in which ride-sharing companies must improve is in their attitude towards people with disabilities. In particular, Uber has claimed that it does not have the legal duty to ensure that drivers comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act because they are independent contractors. With disability rights activists and the Department of Justice dismissing this argument, it is time for Uber and other ride-sharing companies to stop hiding behind legal technicalities and abide by civil rights legislation.
Despite this blemish on their records, ride-sharing services have ultimately had a positive effect on the transportation market. As lawmakers devise needed safety regulations for these companies, they must resist the temptation to impose burdensome economic ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A stack of tracts—colorful, attractive pamphlets that describe the process of salvation—has been sitting on my desk since the beginning of the semester, waiting for me to grab them on my way out the door—a day when I wake up feeling moved and ready to share the gospel with the Cantabrigians in the area. Tracts are often used by Christians when evangelizing. 
But for now, they remain where they are, right next to my Bible—both a reminder of my faith. Here at Harvard, it is almost too easy to forget. Now, don’t get me wrong: I go to church every Sunday, and in various daily situations, I’m constantly thinking of how I should react or respond as a child of God. But, mostly, when I present myself to fellow students, Christianity is pushed to the very periphery.
Arriving here just last semester as a typical pastor’s daughter—born and raised in the church, living a fairly sheltered life—I thought I was sure of myself and my faith. What I’ve quickly learned in my time here is that college teaches you never to be too sure of yourself. I stepped foot on campus, already knowing where I would be worshipping come Sunday. By the will of my parents and myself, I would not go astray. Right from the beginning, I was quickly shaken out of my reverie.
College really was full of young people, without a care in the world, drinking and smoking. It’s not that I was naive. I watched TV and read books that had shown me the part of the world I had been raised to not participate in. Still, it was one thing to know and another to experience up close and personal. In these instances, your faith is put to the test. Having control quickly turns from a passive to an active act. This isn’t to condemn those who do these things, but only to point out that they are not what I believe I should be doing. What’s more, coming from a fairly conservative state like Texas, it was basically unheard of to plan school events on Wednesday evenings, not to mention Sundays around noon.  I was more than shocked when things were scheduled at the same time I had church. I was offended. People on this campus had no regard for us Christians, who were then forced to compromise in some way. Then I realized, my faith wasn’t the only one that mattered here.
If having to reconcile with all this wasn’t enough, people challenged me at every turn. Friends wanted to know why I wasn’t drinking, smoking, or participating in this or that. Saying I was a Christian wasn’t a good enough answer. After all, some of them were Christians and others thought it was a bad excuse. This was particularly jarring for me because Christianity was the label I slapped on for the benefit of others and myself as my reason for everything. But now, I had to really think about my own personal reasons for my actions and behavior. Why was this moral compass so important to me? It was self-exploration like I’ve never done before.
The mistake some young people make is thinking that finding yourself in college has to mean letting go of faith because it is a form of brainwash, where you are restricted by a set of seemingly arbitrary rules that don’t allow you to really live your life. This doesn’t have to be the case. Finding yourself can just as easily be in the context of your faith. Struggling with your beliefs and testing the waters doesn’t necessarily have to render you as unfaithful. On the contrary, I feel I have become a stronger Christian because of it.
There are those, many of them educated young people, who aren’t moved by the idea of a higher power. To them, being a morally upright person or choosing to abstain from certain things need not require faith. Though that is valid, regardless of how we try to rationalize and demand proof in support of everything, not everything has explanation. Not everything makes sense. For me, believing in God is how I reconcile with the unknowable. It is comforting to have someone to look up to when things are clearly beyond my human power. I even stress much less about things because I trust in God. Yet, here I get the sense that “blind” faith is looked down upon in the quiet gaze and silent nods that I get when I talk of Christianity. That believing in something without fully knowing is not the way of the Harvard educated.
Being the judgmental, superior Christian only perpetuates a stereotype that puts so many people off from our faith. So, I began to learn what the love of God meant in a real world context, outside of the pages in the Bible. Becoming a less judgmental person and learning to love and accept others regardless of what they do is one of the best things college has done for me. Still, I am wary of being portrayed as the “Jesus freak” or called out because my more conservative beliefs may not fall in line with the progressive nature of the students here, so I keep quiet. But I refuse to believe that being a Christian and a young college student in this day and age have to be mutually exclusive, even if the two might always be warring against each other. Nevertheless, it is a struggle that I will gladly continue. One day, I will finally grab those tracts from my desk and reach out to others about why salvation is worth it all.

This fall, I realized I was happy.
It didn’t come as a shock. Though I’ve had sad times, I’ve never really been a sad person. I’ve even analyzed my own happiness and announced it—to my friends, to my family, and to myself. But there was something cleaner to this realization. I didn’t need to announce it, and more important than that, I didn’t need to explain it. I just felt it.
I spent three years of college playing mathy games with my happiness. I can remember saying out loud once junior spring, on the phone with my parents, that something made me happy “on balance”: it made me happy more often than it made me sad. Therefore, it was good for me. I was talking about a romantic relationship, but that doesn’t much matter. I was leaning on the same logic many of us apply to our extracurricular activities and even our friendships.
But something that makes us happy “on balance” is not always good. And the reasoning behind saying it’s good is itself quite bad.
A friend suggested the other day that it’s possible to map out two happiness trajectories for each of us. First, there’s our day-to-day, hour-to-hour happiness. This curve oscillates. It leaps when we get a check-plus on a problem set, and plummets when Quincy dining hall is out of waffle fries. But its bounds are set by the second curve.
This curve is flatter. It represents our longer-term happiness. It might slope slightly down, or slightly up, and it might change direction every now and then, but it’s much more stable than the first. And even if something makes the first curve jump up more often than it makes the curve dips down, even if those jumps are higher than the dips are low, there’s a still a chance that something else—some alternative class, maybe, or hobby, or relationship—would push the second curve, slowly but surely, toward greater y-values if we’d take the gamble on making a change.
Another way to look at this, I think, is opportunity cost: Even if a relationship or activity makes us happy more often than it makes us sad, we don’t know whether a different way of spending our time would make us even happier until we try it. A different way of spending time might mean a direct trade-off, such as switching one hookup out for another or ditching The Crimson for the Advocate and model Congress for model UN. It also might just mean more unscheduled hours of the day.
For instance, it turns out that even though my relationship made me happy more often than it made me sad, the freedoms that come with not being in a relationship at this point in my life make me even happier even more often and less sad less often. I’m not seeing someone different—but I’m spending more time with my roommates, on my classes, and in the gym.
It’s worth acknowledging that my math here is horrible—nonsensical at best and nonexistent at worst. According to another Crimson columnist, I’m ignoring a compelling (and mathematically sound) argument about the low expected value of any relationship. Is mine the proper use of the term “opportunity cost”? Does it make sense that the longer-term curve I’ve invented can impose boundaries on the shorter-term one? What units am I using to quantify my happiness?
But perhaps that’s missing the point. Perhaps the task is not to calculate what situations would optimize our happiness, but rather to avoid any sort of calculation. The moment we begin to justify keeping something in our lives is the moment we should begin to understand that, maybe, it shouldn’t be there after all.
We’re using the idea of balance when we shouldn’t be balancing at all. We're looking for happiness to cancel out sadness and achieve a net-neutral state of mind, when we should be seeking out happiness for happiness' sake. We’re treating life like problem sets when we should really stop and smell the waffle fries.

To the editor:
I was saddened by the news account of protests at the Brandeis ceremony where Law School Dean Martha Minow received a well-deserved award for her scholarship in human rights. While I share many of the concerns of the Reclaim Harvard Law students who led the protest—particularly their concerns about the Law School's shield (the Royall family coat of arms) and the racial bias (both subtle and overt) that infects our society, our legal system, and legal education—Dean Minow deserves credit for being one of the first leaders at the Law School to take these concerns seriously. She has the unenviable job of managing a lot of competing concerns and guiding the Law School through a thoughtful process in which all voices are heard. As a Law School alum and an HLS Lecturer on Law, I applaud her efforts to make the Law School a place where everyone—students, staff, faculty, and alumni—is treated with respect.

For the more than 400 women who attended WECode, the largest student-run conference focused on women in computer science, it may have been easy to forget the stark gender imbalance that exists in the field.
Over the course of the weekend, attendees flocked to Northwest Labs to hear from four keynote speakers and choose from 11 workshops and six panels, all the while meeting from around the world who focus on women in computer science.
WECode co-chair Abigail C. Orlando ’17 said while there is a strong network of women in computer science at Harvard, the same is not true for many colleges across the country. She hoped for WECode to be a platform to bring technical women together.
“A lot of the girls who come here come from schools where they are literally the only girls; [the conference] makes them see that they’re not alone,” WECode co-chair  Billie Wei ’17 said.
Conference attendee Zoe Millard said she is one of eight women out of 120 total computer science concentrators at Stevens Institute of Technology.
“I was looking to build out [Stevens’s Women in Computer Science] more to build a community of women, I wanted to see how to run similar events and operate a similar organization,” Millard said.
The WECode conference, now in its third year, focused on technology in innovation and civic service, co-chairs Wei and Orlando said.
Keynote speaker Cathryn Posey, who works for the United States Digital Service at the White House and is the founder of the Tech By Superwomen movement, spoke about the need for diversity in technological innovation in order to make a difference in people’s lives.
“The government uses technology to make transformational changes to meet people’s needs, but it only works if people in the tech industry raise their hands,” she said.  “[T]o make it better, you have to participate.”
As a conference targeting women in computer science, WECode attracts a variety of lucrative sponsors who hope to interact with attendees through panel conversations and skill-training workshops to help attendees prepare for recruitment.
“Sponsors really like our event because they feel like it’s a way to get to know women in technology better,” Wei said. “They’ve been incredibly supportive and approach the conference in ‘how can we open up the conversation for women in computer science.’”

Vickie Victor, who studies  computer science at Mount Holyoke college, said the speakers and workshops affirmed her interests in computer science.
“I know that a lot of times we have technological innovations that are really to have something cool and fancy,” she said. “WECode really showed how people could use their technological knowledge to bring changes to the community and that is really powerful.”

Several Harvard students and professors co-signed a letter calling for the president of the American Geophysical Union to end all union sponsorship ties with ExxonMobil, joining more than 100 members of the organization and other geoscientists.
AGU, an association of thousands of geophysists from around the globe, currently receives Exxon sponsorship for its annual fall meetings. The multinational oil and gas company has been under investigation by the New York and California attorney generals for its climate change denial.
One of the letter’s signatories, Harvard earth and planetary sciences Ph.D. student Simon J. Lock, said that integrity, particularly in climate research, is crucial in the scientific community.
“Having a company that has been suspected of spreading misinformation makes our lives much more difficult and undermines the very core values that we have as scientists,” Lock said.
Earth and planetary sciences Ph.D. student Pattanun Achakulwisut said the push to end sponsorship ties with Exxon began when she and two other MIT students noticed that Exxon's sponsorship was visible at AGU’s conference in December 2015.
Achakulwisut, who published an opinion piece in the Guardian with the other two students about the Exxon sponsorship, said Exxon’s relationship with AGU is “a massive conflict of interest.”
Last year, AGU announced a new organizational support policy in which they prohibited the acceptance of “funding from organizational partners that promote and/or disseminate misinformation of science.”
Achakulwisut said she thinks the Exxon sponsorship violates this policy and hopes her opinion piece will encourage AGU to drop it.
Since the release of the letter, AGU president Margaret Leinen updated a previously response to the sponsorship issue in a blog post. In the post, Leinen said she welcomed questions over the Exxon sponsorship, promising to raise the topic at AGU’s April board meeting following consultation with "various member constituencies as well other stakeholders."
Exxon recently told The Guardian that it did not suppress climate change research.
Achakulwisut said she appreciated Leinen's blog post but wants closer scrutiny. 
“We’re glad to see that they’ve committed to bring up this issue at their meeting, [but] I would like to see AGU look past Exxon’s public statements and actually focus on what [they are] still doing,” Achakulwisut said.
Lock said it was important to raise Exxon’s involvement with AGU as a public issue because AGU represents the views of geoscientists and is a large publisher of science journals.
“It doesn’t matter if Exxon is confirmed or cleared of being involved in misinformation; the public perception that they have some influence on what we produce as scientists is a huge problem,” Lock said.

In an effort to bring to light the artistic achievements of indigenous peoples in Australia, the Harvard Art Museums presented the film “Beneath Clouds” as part of its film series Sunday.
The movie screenings, titled “Together, Alone: Indigenous Film Now,” are held in the Art Museums every Sunday afternoon and designed to complement the Museums’ special exhibition on Australian aboriginal art open through Sept. 18. The film series is cosponsored by the Harvard Native American Program.
The exhibit includes works from permanent collections in Australian national galleries and portrays landscape art in a way that is distinctive  from that of European or American art.
Unlike European-American landscape technique, which depicts the subject from a horizontal perspective, as if looking at the subject on a plane, “Australian aboriginal art looks from above, looks from a bird’s eye position, which produces extraordinary perspectives,” English professor W. James Simpson said. Simpson is a member of the Committee on Australian Studies, which helped plan the art exhibit.
The films and exhibit aim both to recognize the artistic achievements of Australian aboriginals and portray the reality of Australian indigenous life from insider perspectives. Jason Packineau, the community coordinator for the Native American Program, said the films in particular are an “additional way for people to understand what the aboriginal lifestyle is like and what the aboriginal experience is all about.”
This week’s screening was Australian aboriginal filmmaker Ivan Sen’s first feature movie, which recounts the story of two teenagers who cross paths on their journey to find their purpose and identity. As the artwork in the exhibit, the cinematography of the film captures the unique experience of Australian aboriginals, with a particular focus on Australia’s landscape.
“The land itself is a kind of character,” the art exhibit’s curator Stephen Gilchrist said.
The film depicted striking race inequalities in Australia, which attendee Johanna Felter said gave viewers a better understanding of the unique experience of Australian aboriginals.
In general, the film series seeks to complement the artwork in the exhibit by giving viewers a more concrete depiction of Australian aboriginal life and by using cinematographic interpretations to visually emphasize Australia’s vast interior, Simpson said.

UPDATED: March 1, 2016, at 12:50 a.m.
The Harvard College Women’s Center kicked off its annual Women’s Week Sunday to recognize the experiences of women and laud their historical achievements.
“The overall mission is to celebrate women’s achievements explore women’s issues and encourage dialogue at Harvard about what it means to be a woman in today’s society,” administrative fellow for the Women's Center Vincent T. Harris said.
This year marks the ninth time the Women’s Center has hosted the week-long program, Harris said. Before, the event was organized by the Seneca, an unrecognized all-women social organization founded in 1999. The Seneca remains involved, hosting an event alongside two other student groups during the week.
The Women’s Center’s steering committee chose the 15 student groups and departments from a wide variety of applications sent last fall, Harris said, adding that groups were selected based on this year’s theme, “Raising Our Voices.”
“We’re really excited about the ways these groups have organized and we think it will be representative of the theme,” Harris said. “Given the campus climate across the country, really, Harvard also has students who want to raise their voices.”
One such group, the Asian American Women’s Association, is working in conjunction with the Association of Black Harvard Women and Latinas Unidas to create an event entitled “Policing Bodies: The Hypersexualization of Women of Color.” The Women’s Center has highlighted the particular event and more than 250 people have  indicated interest on the event’s Facebook page.
Asian American Women's Association co-presidents Joanna W. Liu ’18 and Yvenna Chen ’17 came up with the idea for the event after previously working with the Association of Black Harvard Women and Latinas Unidas.
“We heard about the opportunity to host an event through the Women’s Center and we knew pretty early on that we wanted to work with LU and ABHW  because we’ve worked with them in the past; so we started thinking about what issues we all relate to,” Liu said.
The format for the event will be similar to many of the various events available at Women’s Week, with interactive discussions and panelists.
“We’re going to have four panelists and we have a list of questions for these panelists,” Chen said. “After each question, we’ll turn it over to the audience and engage them to talk about these questions.”
The events at Women’s Week will not be restricted to just women or related groups, organizers said.
“One really important aspect of this event is allyship and we should be talking about how people who are not women of color can be allies,” Chen said.

President of Rwanda Paul Kagame fielded questions from students at the Institute of Politics on Friday regarding censorship of the press, balancing democracy and progress, and his decision to run for an unprecedented third term following a constitutional referendum.
The president spoke in front of a packed forum with police and secret service guarding all entrances to the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum as protesters gathered outside of the building. After delivering a short speech, Kagame answered questions from the audience that called his style of leadership into question.
“He was pretty real,” said Avika Dua ’17, “He wasn't censoring himself too much.”
Kagame has been credited for leading Rwanda’s transition from a dark, post-genocide period in its history to one of increased prosperity. However, he has also been criticized for censoring media outlets in the country, including the BBC, and has faced allegations that he has ordered attacks on political opponents. After Rwandans voted to approve a change to the constitution, lifting the restrictions that prevented Kagame from running for a third term, Kagame announced he would run again for office in 2017.
Kagame addressed these criticisms as in part originating from Western democracies whose constituents may not completely understand Rwanda’s situation.
“Deep down, we are still thought to be incapable of anything better than mimicry,” he said. “How else can you understand the experience, which I have often had, of being presented with the names of potential successors, and demanded to pick one among them, something which I have neither the desire, the power, nor the right to do.”
One student, Jack H. Stone ’19, agreed with Kagame, saying “we can’t judge leaders through a Western lens all the time... just because in the United States it would be bad for him to crack down on the press or muzzle dissent.”
“He rebuilt Rwanda completely, economically and politically, after the genocide,” Stone added.
In choosing to run for a third term, which would allow him to stay in power until at least 2024, Kagame said he was following the will of the people.
“The fact is, the process to arrive at that point [of having a new leader chosen] is being decided by people other than myself,” Kagame said. “Come help me convince [Rwandan citizens] that they don’t need me….When they don’t need me, I will just go home and sit and relax, absolutely.”
Kagame also spoke about his country's censorship of some media, including a ban on BBC broadcasts in the Kinyarwanda language, saying it is not of great importance to the Rwandan people.
“Rwandans—what they feel, the choices they make, whatever they want to do, they will do, irrespective of what the BBC says,” Kagame said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council leaders apologized on Sunday to theater groups who criticized the body for failing to adequately inform students about a recent cap on theater funding.
Addressing increasing funding allocations to theater groups on campus, the UC’s Finance Committee passed legislation last week—entitled the “Open Theatre Budget Ordinance of 2016”—that sets a semesterly $16,500 cap on funding to theater organizations. An additional $5,000 fund is available to theater productions whose subject matter aligns with one of the UC’s “compelling interests” of the year: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces.
In the days since the Finance Committee passed the new legislation, members of various theater groups have taken to online platforms to criticize the Council for what they called a failure of communication.
Before fielding questions from leaders of theater organizations, UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 clarified that although the legislation sets a maximum funding allocation, theater organizations still stand to receive more funding this year.
“This semester, we will be giving out an unprecedented amount of money to the theater community at Harvard, more than any other UC has in recent history,” Banks said.
Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club President Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, who attended the meeting, expressed gratitude to the UC for providing funding to theatrical productions, but raised concerns over the UC’s communication with theater groups ahead of time regarding the new policy, and the criteria for the additional $5,000 funding to theater groups.
“We in the HRDC community have been sorely disappointed with the lack of communication this semester,” Brophy said, reading from a prepared statement. “Much of the outcry was due to the lack of transparency.”
Finance Committee chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who sponsored the policy, said the legislation seeks to control for the growing rate of fund requests from theater organizations.
“I wanted to make sure that any student organization has an equal opportunity to get a decent amount of funding from the UC,” Greenlaw said.
In response to a question from BlackCAST President Jennifer L. Berrian ’16, Greenlaw reassured leaders of theater organizations that they could still expect to receive the typical $1,000 allotment for each of their theatrical productions this semester. He added that future grant amounts could vary depending on the demand for theater funding.
Addressing criticisms about the Council’s communication of the theater legislation, Greenlaw apologized for not soliciting the feedback of theater organizations when crafting the new policy.
“I want to personally apologize that we messed up,” Greenlaw said. “I should’ve reached out beforehand. I should’ve gotten more input beforehand.”
“If the Finance Committee is pursuing some sort of financial policy that disproportionately affects a particular constituency, we will guarantee that we will make a good faith effort to reach out to that constituency first, every single time,” he added.
Banks and UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 expressed similar sentiments and promised to “increase communication” between the Council and student organizations.
The Council spent a large portion of the meeting fielding criticisms and questions from leaders of theater organizations, who also took issue with the new “compelling interest based” requirements for the additional $5,000 fund.
Brophy called the requirements “problematic” and argued that the UC should not base funding to theatrical productions on subject matter.
“As an organization, one of our largest interests is the representation of a wide range of perspectives and issues,” Brophy said. “This funding decision seems to run counter to the things that an artistic community stands for.”
Other UC representatives echoed Brophy, pointing out that the clause might be seen as “tacit endorsement” of certain types of productions.
“I don’t think there should be any pressure on the arts community to funnel its creative energy to further any social issue,” Crimson Yard representative Nicholas Whittaker ’19 said.
Replying to a question about the UC’s criteria for judging theater performances that align with the compelling interests, Greenlaw said the additional funds are about “content, not about the viewpoint.” Under last week’s legislation, the Finance Committee will call an “expert… to counsel UC interviewers.” Greenlaw said the Finance Committee has yet to determine who the expert will be.
Rather said the policy overall aims to reward productions that focus on campus-wide concerns. “We want to make sure that we have enough funding to address these constantly changing issues,” she said.
Several UC representatives also defended the policy, emphasizing the important role of the UC in promoting important issues on campus.
“I do think it’s possible to endorse the coverage of certain topics,” Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, said. “I’d be proud if we end up giving extra funding to a play that I disagree with.”
During the meeting, the UC voted to allocate $49,097 to club sports and $877 to TEDxHarvardCollege. The Council also voted to allocate $2,500 to fund Project H, a Student Initiatives Committee program that encourages students to plan “open, inclusive social initiatives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and tutors in Lowell and Mather gathered to discuss issues of race and diversity in response to controversy surrounding the 88th Academy Awards.
This year’s Oscars awards have garnered controversy in the media for the lack of racial diversity of the nominees selected for many top award categories.
Around 30 people gathered to watch the annual awards ceremony in Lowell’s Junior Common Room Sunday. During commercial breaks, Lowell race relations tutor Shaniece Criss asked the audience about their thoughts on the issues of diversity in the Oscars with the intention of sparking small discussions throughout the night.
Lowell resident Qing Qing Miao ’16 praised the event as an opportunity to talk about the lack of racial diversity in the film industry.
“I think that Hollywood’s internal struggle or attempt to deal with the racism issue is incredibly important,” she said. “One benefit of having it in this setting is that we have a conversation piece that resonates with a lot of different people.”
Lowell race relations tutor Jonathan R. Bruno said he hoped the screening would balance both serious discussion and entertainment.
“Hopefully we’re also reaching some students who just wanted to watch the Oscars and we can suddenly transform this occasion for fun to engage with this thing of pop culture and add in a space to reflect on it from a different angle,” he said.
Bruno emphasized the importance of having events, like the Oscars screening, in the Houses in order to make conversations about race and diversity more accessible to students.
“Having events in the House is different than having them in the classroom,” he said. “Both are really important, of course, but having them in the House again provides an alternative entry point for people in a space where they feel at home.”
Mather House held a similar event showing the movie “Selma” last week with a discussion led by residential tutors and resident dean Luke A. Leafgren. Mather race relations tutor Anthony Jack led a discussion about Hollywood’s “troubling” lack of diversity before the movie screening, according to Leafgren.
Leafgren said he views the event as part of a larger effort to engage students in discussions about race and inclusion in the House.
“Such conversations are incredibly important, but they aren’t always easy, so it takes repeated practice to learn how to listen with curiosity,” he wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cabot House held an off-the-record conversation Sunday night—billed by Cabot Faculty Deans Rakesh Khurana and Stephanie R. Khurana as a “continued dialogue” about sexual assault and harassment—nearly two weeks after a House alumna alleged administrators dealt poorly with her reported case of sexual assault.
On Feb. 16, Alyssa R. Leader ’15, a Cabot graduate, filed a lawsuit against the University reporting that a male repeatedly threatened, abused, and sexually assaulted her while inside Cabot House, in addition to other locations. The lawsuit says Tiffanie L. Ting, Cabot’s resident dean, discouraged Leader from filing a formal complaint, and said her perpetrator could not be removed from the House.
In her lawsuit, Leader also requests punitive damages for Harvard and compensation, and charged that Harvard failed to abide by federal guidance for sexual assault investigations and that the University’s handling of the case violated federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
Ting did not respond to a request for comment last week on the lawsuit. Rakesh Khurana, who also serves as Dean of the College, declined to comment on its content. Last week, he declined to comment on Leader’s specific allegations, although he said Harvard administrators  “take seriously and swiftly respond to all allegations of sexual assault and harassment.”
The event was restricted to Cabot residents, and roughly a dozen students and tutors attended the event, which lasted about an hour and 45 minutes. Both Faculty Deans also also attended.
Members of Cabot House have been hesitant to comment publicly on the case. Cabot Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment-designated tutor Roman Feiman said he attended the meeting but declined to comment further.
Cabot Cafe, a student-run coffee shop in the House, features as one of several settings in which Leader said she was sexually harassed. Employees of Cabot Cafe declined to comment on claims made in Leader’s lawsuit, but several sent an identical statement that "Cabot Cafe takes the issue of sexual assault on Harvard's campus very seriously. However, we are not in a position to comment on the current lawsuit.”
In Stephanie Khurana’s email last Thursday to Cabot House announcing the meeting, she and Khurana wrote that,  “we along with College staff are committed to ensuring a healthy and respectful community. Any incidence of sexual assault or harassment is not acceptable, and we hope you know that we are committed to creating an environment at Cabot and more broadly where every student is safe and respected.”
On Tuesday, the Undergraduate Council will host a town hall discussion about Harvard’s sexual assault policy, featuring the University’s Title IX coordinator Mia Karvonides.
The lawsuit comes as Harvard responds to the results of a campus sexual conduct climate survey that University President Drew G. Faust called “deeply disturbing.”
Thirty-one percent of senior undergraduate females at Harvard College who responded to the survey last spring said they had experienced some form of sexual assault—what the survey termed “nonconsensual sexual contact”—during their time at the College. Sixteen percent, or 90 women, reported that they had experienced sexual penetration or attempted penetration without their consent during that time.
In response to the findings, Faust charged a University-wide task force with investigating sexual assault prevention. The task force, led by former Provost Steven E. Hyman, has yet to issue a finalized set of recommendations—missing an initial January deadline—although administrators said they hoped to release the report in February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

For the second time this season, Harvard (12-16, 4-8 Ivy) came into its game against Brown (8-17, 3-9 Ivy) after a difficult-to-stomach loss.
Both times, the Bears provided exactly the boost that the Crimson needed. A day after trailing Yale by double digits for nearly the entire second half, Harvard jumped out to a 14-point lead midway through the first half in Providence and never looked back in a 61-52 victory.
The Crimson won the game on the defensive end—while Brown senior Cedric Kuakumensah and junior Tavon Blackmon combined for 36 points on 48 percent shooting, the rest of the team made just 15 percent of its shots. Brown starters Obi Okolie, Kyle Haber, and Steven Spieth—whose brother, Masters champion Jordan Spieth, was in attendance—missed all 19 of their shots and had just three points combined.
“You can see the fatigue on both teams but I was proud of our kids with the gutsy effort of bouncing back from last night,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
DOING IT ON HIS OWN
In the absence of freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy (out with a concussion), Harvard struggled Friday to find a balance on offense against Yale. The team, which shot just 40 percent in the loss, depended heavily on seniors Patrick Steeves and Agunwa Okolie (27 combined points) to generate offense.
On Saturday, the team quickly got back to what made it successful during the nonconference season—spacing the floor and giving its post players room to operate inside. The key to that was freshman Corey Johnson, who tied a Harvard record with six threes on the night.
Unlike Friday in New Haven, when his only two three point attempts came after the outcome was no longer in doubt, Johnson came out firing for the Crimson. He took threes on three of the first four possessions, nailing two to stake Harvard out to a 6-2 lead. The first-year had 10 points—more than his average—in the first 12 minutes as Harvard jumped out to a quick 23-9 lead.
“I thought Corey’s threes early were huge for us,” Amaker said. “We got off to a huge start and put them in a hole and he was the guy that really was nailing some shots for us that stretched the defense … It was awesome to see shots going in from him and certainly early I thought that was a big key for us to win this game.”
Johnson, who finished with a season-high 24 points, was quick to credit his teammates—who assisted on seven of his nine field goals—for his performance.
“My teammates did a really good job of getting me open, setting screens for me,” Johnson said. “I was just coming off and if I had an open shot, I’d take it.”
DISAPPEARING, RE-EMERGING
For the second straight game, the Crimson largely played without the services of its two main big men—junior Zena Edosomwan and captain Evan Cummins. The starting frontcourt combined for just nine points and nine rebounds in 29 foul-plagued minutes.
Enter Okolie. The senior wing pulled down 19 rebounds—a record for the Amaker era—and anchored small units that had him alternatingly guarding both guards and big men.
“We do a lot of practice with me and Pat at the four and the five,” Okolie said “It’s all about moving. We need to move the ball, set screens, slips, post up, so we work on that in practice. We are very versatile and it worked out for us tonight.”
Okolie filled up the stat sheet for the Crimson, notching four assists and 10 points to go with the 19 rebounds while harassing Brown guard Tavon Blackmon around the perimeter.
“[He’s] being basically a do-it-all kind of player for us,” Amaker said. “I’m so proud of him. He’s earned everything that has come his way with how he’s played this year and tonight was a gutsy effort for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­Coming into the 2016 Ivy League Championships, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had one thing on its mind: redemption. The Crimson’s only losses in the last two years have come at the hands of Princeton, and this year’s conference championships offered Harvard a chance to take back the advantage. Despite entering the meet facing heavy odds, the Crimson almost pulled off what seemed to be impossible at the beginning of the meet.
Harvard (9-1, 6-1 Ivy League) held a close lead over the Tigers (7-0, 7-0) until the fourth-from-last event of the meet, but a late surge saw Princeton edge out the Crimson, 1520.5-1499.
This weekend’s win for the Tigers at the Katherine Moran Coleman Pool in Providence, R.I. marked the second time in as many years that Princeton has topped Harvard for bragging rights among the Ancient Eight.
“We were expected to lose this meet by a lot,” co-captain Christian Yeager said. “We were heavily the underdogs, and we fought our way to one of the closest, most exciting meets of the year. Every swimmer stepped up and fought their heart out to try to bring us a championship that we had no business competing for.”
No one would have expected the final result after the first two days of the meet. The Crimson jumped out to a blazing start, with the 200 free relay team of juniors Paul O’Hara and Max Yakubovich, sophomore Steven Tan, and freshman Sebastian Lutz earning top marks in the first event.
The group would reassemble for the 400 medley relay, with sophomore Shane McNamara in for O’Hara, clocking in second at 3:10.56. Not to be outdone, O’Hara went on to pick up an individual gold of his own in the 50 free.
On the boards, sophomore David Pfeiffer saw his run of victories snapped but still ended up second in the one-meter event and fourth in the three-meter dive.
As the first day came to a close, Harvard held a close lead over Princeton, with the rest of the field already far behind.
The Crimson would retain the advantage on the second day, exploding out of the gates yet again and taking podium finishes in five of the first six events.
Mirroring Thursday’s result, the 200 medley relay team of Tan, Yakubovich, McNamara, and O’Hara outpaced Princeton’s A squad to capture top marks in the first final of the second day. Yakubovich would then earn his second gold medal of the evening in the 100 butterfly.
Freshman Logan Houck added to Harvard’s momentum with a third-place result in the 1000 free, and junior Aly Abdel Khalik in the 200 free and McNamara in the 100 breast each chipped in a silver medal finish to stretch the Crimson’s lead even further.
However, on the final day, Princeton began to edge closer to Harvard in the team standings. The Crimson did its best to hold the Tigers off, but finished ahead of Princeton in only two of the seven events during Saturday’s competition.
Harvard got its lone win of the last day from co-captain Jacob Luna in the 200 fly. The senior mounted a furious comeback in the final 50 yards to touch the wall first in 1:44.27.
“The best swim I’ve seen in my four years here was Luna’s 200 fly,” Yeager said. “In the spirit of the meet, he had no business winning that event and he brought us within striking distance to try to win this meet. That was the single greatest swim of the meet and I’m sure everyone in the Ivy League would agree.”
Junior Jack Manchester also collected a silver medal in the 200 back, but it would not be enough to derail the momentum Princeton had built up.
Entering the last event, the Tigers needed a top-two result to capture the overall title, and Princeton senior Sandy Bole touched the wall first to secure the victory and spell out heartbreak for the Crimson for the second year in a row.
Despite the disappointment of this weekend’s result, Harvard is already looking forward to what the future holds for the team.
“We hope to score as many points as possible [at NCAAs] to keep pushing Harvard’s name towards the top amongst other elite Division I swimming schools,” sophomore Koya Osada said. “Next year, the team’s primary objective will be to recapture the Ivy League crown, and we are fortunate to have the opportunity to do this in our home pool.”
“The future is extremely bright for our team,” Yeager added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman shortstop Rhianna Rich set the tone for Harvard’s offense in her collegiate debut, and the Crimson (3-1) opened the 2016 season with three wins in four games at the Jacksonville University Green and Gold Classic.
Rich tallied nine hits in 16 at bats while crossing the plate seven times over the weekend. Four of the El Segundo, Calif. native’s hits went for extra bases, as she recorded a double, two triples, and a home run.
Along with Rich, sophomore left fielder Maddy Kaplan had a strong weekend at the plate. Kaplan went 6-for-14 with 3 doubles, six RBI, two walks, and a stolen base.
“I think the whole team was really excited to be together and finally get out and play on the field because we’ve been stuck in the bubble for the past month,” Rich said.
HARVARD 11, JACKSONVILLE 5
After dropping Saturday’s first game to Albany (RECORD), Harvard got back into the win column under the lights against Jacksonville.
The Crimson came alive offensively in its last game of the weekend with 15 hits and 11 runs.
Sophomore Taylor Cabe got her second start in the circle and improved to 2-0.
Freshman Kathleen Duncan closed out her third game out of four on the weekend. Although she did not pick up the save because of Harvard’s six-run lead, she was once again dominant in the circle.
“Katie Duncan and Sarah Smith really did well coming in from the bullpen to finish games,” captain Zoe Galindo said. “Coming in on relief as a pitcher is a really difficult thing to do, so it’s a really good learning experience for them.”
ALBANY 7, HARVARD 4
Holding a comfortable 4-1 lead after four and a half innings of play, the Crimson was looking at a third straight win to open its season.
However, after an Albany rally that saw five Great Danes cross the plate in the fifth inning, Harvard was unable to mount a comeback and ended up with its first loss of 2016.
Albany sophomore Devin Durando went the distance and only surrendered four runs. In the circle for the Crimson, Groom cruised through the first four innings but faltered in the fifth.
Eight of the Great Danes 11 hits were singles, but they capitalized on a big fifth inning to push seven total runs across the plate.
HARVARD 5, ST. BONAVENTURE 3
Facing a two-run deficit following the first inning of play against St. Bonaventure (1-3), Harvard rallied later in the game and came away with a sweep of Friday’s doubleheader.
Rich recorded two hits in four at bats, including a triple and a home run, drove in two runs and scored two herself.
“Rhianna is a super-talented freshman,” Galindo said. “She had a great weekend. A lot of the younger players on the team are going to be really big playmakers this season.”
The Crimson’s starting pitcher, captain Morgan Groom, pitched four innings of two-run ball, and she struck out five.
Duncan scattered four hits over three innings of relief and notched the save, only surrendering one run in the process.
HARVARD 7, PRESBYTARIAN 2
Harvard jumped on Presbyterian (6-4) starter Sydney Seigler in the early going, plating five runs in the game’s first three innings. The Blue Hose were never able to put together an offensive threat, and the Crimson emerged with a comfortable 7-2 win.
Harvard was able to take advantage of some costly Presbyterian defensive lapses, as three errors and four unearned runs put the game out of reach for the Blue Hose.
Cabe got the nod as the opening day starter, and the righthander tossed a strong four and a third innings to earn the win.
Freshman Sarah Smith pitched the rest of the game in relief and shut down the Presbyterian offense.
Kaplan reached base in all four of her plate appearances, and she drove in three of Harvard’s seven runs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend the Harvard men’s volleyball team may have hit the midpoint of its conference season, but a laundry list of questions remains unanswered.
Foremost among the questions: Coming off a weekend of domination against George Mason, did the Crimson have enough momentum make a push for the EIVA title?
At least for another seven days, that doubt remains. By splitting a weekend slate against Princeton (2-8, 2-3 EIVA) and NJIT (2-10, 2-2), Harvard (7-6, 4-2) maintained a hold on second place but failed to gain ground on league-leading Penn State.
“The top is in sight for us,” captain Branden Clemens said. “We definitely do have work to do. We need to alter our work ethic and our mentality…to be more intense, I think. That’ll help us reach the top.”
NJIT 3, HARVARD 2
This Saturday afternoon in Newark, N.J., the Crimson led and led until it didn’t.
Up two sets to one in the game score, Harvard allowed the Highlanders to force a fifth set; up 3-0 in that tiebreaker, the Crimson watched as NJIT mounted a comeback.
Ultimately the contest ended when the Highlanders strung together a 9-2 run, earning the set win, 15-9, and handing Harvard a five-set defeat.
Clemens led his side in kills (19), digs (11), and blocks (7). Junior outside hitter Casey White and sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch also posted double-digit finish totals, with 12 and 11, respectively.
“Saturday was the first game where I felt like we weren’t as super high-energy as normal,” Clemens said. “It definitely wasn’t our most crisp weekend.”
Harvard took early control in the afternoon, winning two of the first three games. The third frame was the most dominant: after claiming two of the first three points, the Crimson never trailed, finishing with a 25-19 victory.
But NJIT battled back to win the fourth and fifth sets—both after closing an early gap. Down 2-1, for example, the Highlanders faced an 11-7 deficit before mounting a comeback. With the score tied at 18-18, NJIT won four consecutive points and pushed ahead for the 25-20 set.
On an afternoon when neither team hit above .240, both sides showed signs of sloppy play throughout the match. Notably, in the first frame, the Highlanders racked up more errors than kills in a 25-22 game defeat.
In fact, the only game in which both teams hit above .200 was the second, when NJIT used a pair of mid-set 4-0 stretches to take control in a 25-22 win.
“We’re at the midpoint of the season, roughly,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “We’re playing well, but we want to be playing our best volleyball in April when we go to conference playoffs.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
Dillon Gym in Princeton, N.J. is typically a tough place to play. The Tigers have posted an above-.500 winning percentage in EIVA play in the past four seasons, and Harvard has lost two of its last three road contests against Princeton.
But last Friday night, the Crimson shook off recent history and a slow start to drop the two-win Tigers in three sets.
“Playing Princeton is a very big game for us because they’re the only other Ivy League team that has men’s volleyball,” Schlossman said. “That was a big emotional win on Friday.”
Most of the drama was concentrated in the first game, when the Tigers fended off a pair of game points to force a tiebreak.
Four times Harvard took a one-point lead; four times Princeton repelled the effort. It was only at 29-28 that an attack error by the Tigers’ Kendall Ratter concluded the set.
By the third frame, the back-and-forth competition had ended. The Crimson won the first three points of the game, took a 12-4 lead, and glided to a 25-20 win.
Clemens totaled 16 finishes in three sets, and sophomores Gretsch and Riley Moore added eight apiece. Overall the team hit .418, led by the .556 rate posted by freshman middle blocker Trevor Dow.
A turning point came midway through the second frame, when a 5-2 Harvard run negated an early Princeton lead. The two teams proceeded to trade points before a kill by sophomore setter Marko Kostich claimed the set for the Crimson, 25-21.
“The takeaway from the weekend is, we really did some things well but still have a lot to work on,” Clemens said. “Hopefully [we’ll] become more consistent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a contested first round defeat, 5-4, to No. 3 St. Lawrence on Friday at Brady Squash Center in New Haven, Conn., No. 6 Harvard men’s squash’s quest for the Potter Cup officially came to a close.
Although the Crimson (6-7, 5-4 Ivy) followed up the defeat with a solid win against No. 7 Dartmouth to reach the consolation finals, it was ultimately unable to completely recover, as a 7-2 loss to No. 5 Penn on Sunday earned the squad a sixth place finish at the CSA National Team Championships
“We were seeded 6th for this tournament and finished in that position, so we performed to our seedings,” junior co-captain Brian Koh said. “Of course, we would have loved to have sneaked that win in the quarterfinals, which would have been awesome. However, being down a player with injury, I felt we had a good weekend.”
Losing junior co-captain Devin McLaughlin to injury just before the tournament did not help the team’s odds at winning a championship.  But it seems as if the unfortunate scenario hardened the squad’s resolve headed into the weekend.
“I think the team responded really well to [McLaughlin’s] injury,” sophomore Mandela Patrick said.  “We knew it'd be tough to win nationals without him, but everyone played with their heart and left everything on court. Dev's injury was an obstacle, yes, but we didn't let it deter us in our prep and matches, in fact, it pushed us even harder.”
While it is impossible to predict whether Harvard would have fared better with injured McLaughlin in the lineup, his replacement at the No. 6 position, freshman Alexi Gosset, was winless on the weekend. In fact, the rookie suffered more losses in the tournament, three, than McLaughlin had on the entire season, as the junior registered a lone two losses.
“We knew this season would be a toss up between the nations top eight teams” Koh said. “So all we could do was play with our hearts, and I felt we did that, so no real regrets on that end.”
No. 5 PENN 7, HARVARD 2
As the victor against Penn’s Karim Tarek, 3-1, in the first match to come off the court, Koh helped set the Crimson out to the early lead.  But that lead would not last very long, as Penn (11-6, 5-4) came storming back by winning seven of the final eight matches to claim victory in the consolation finals.
The only other Harvard winner on the day was sophomore David Ryan at the first position. Two others, junior Dylan Murray and sophomore Seif Eleinen came close by forcing their opponents to a fifth game, although Murray was hampered by the calf strain he suffered the day prior. Eleinen’s loss at the No. 7 slot, was only his second of the season and the first such loss in any game that has gone the distance in his collegiate career.
HARVARD 6, No. 7 DARTMOUTH 3
On Saturday, however, Harvard was able to produce a solid result against a fellow Ivy League competitor. No. 7 Dartmouth (9-6, 5-3) threatened early, but the Big Green was unable to capture the same spark that led it to what was then perceived as a shocking upset of the Crimson in the opening match of the season.
Although Koh was the only winner in the first wave of matches, putting Harvard in a 2-1 hole, the team went on to win five of the next six en-route to claiming victory in the top five positions with the help of decisive 3-2 triumphs by Murray, and sophomore Bradley Smith at the fifth and second slots, respectively.
No. 3 ST. LAWRENCE 5, HARVARD 4
In it first round matchup of the eight-team tournament on Friday, the Crimson faced a familiar foe, having previously lost to Saint Lawrence (15-3, 4-0 Liberty) earlier in the year.
The result this time around was identical to the earlier match in terms of the final score line and nearly identical in terms of results at each positions with the two squads trading off victories at the sixth and eighth positions. The loss marked the first time the team has been knocked out of the opening round of the tournament since 2011.
No member of Harvard’s top four was able to muster a win on the day as Koh was the only one to even grab a game from his competitor in his 3-1 defeat. However, the bottom half of the ladder responded well as the Crimson claimed victory in four of the five lower positions. Eleinen, Patrick, Murray, and freshman Jack Cooper were responsible for those wins at their respective positions.
We honestly have no major regrets this season,” Partick said. “Yeah we lost some tough matches, but I don't see what we as a team could have done differently to make a difference. Our prep was solid, just that little bit of luck wasn't with us this season. We competed with the best without Dev, and with great recruits coming next year, the sky is the limit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering its third game of the season on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team did not have a single regulation win to its name. However, after four quarters passed against UMass, the Crimson still had not suffered its first regulation loss either.
In fact, in its unprecedented third consecutive overtime game, Harvard had a chance to move to 3-0 on the year. After defeating Villanova and Holy Cross in extra periods last week, the Crimson found itself looking for yet another sudden-death goal against the Minutemen on the road.
Unlike on Tuesday, when it needed two overtimes to put away the Crusaders, Harvard scored the winner against UMass only 10 seconds after the restart. Midfielder and captain Sean Mahon picked up the ground ball from the faceoff and quickly sent a pass upfield to sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek. Without wasting any time, Cheek set up senior attackman Devin Dwyer with an opportunity in front of the goal.
Dwyer knew he could get a shot past Minutemen sophomore goalie Dan Dolan, not just because he had already tallied four goals earlier in the game, but also because Dolan was his old high school teammate.
Even with the heightened stakes, Dwyer didn’t hesitate. He buried the shot and ended the game.
With the 10-9 victory, the No. 14/15 Crimson (3-0) secured its best start to a season since 2002. The game itself, meanwhile, marked the first time in the team’s 136-year history that it played overtime in three straight contests. On the other hand, UMass (1-2) now looks to rediscover the form that helped it rout No. 11/11 Ohio State, 16-9, last weekend.
For much of the game on Saturday, it seemed as if UMass had brought the same intensity that fueled its success over the Buckeyes a week prior. In front of a crowd of almost 1,000 fans at Garber Field, the Minutemen pounded their way to a 6-3 lead at halftime.
After falling behind 3-1 early in the game, they found the back of the net five straight times in the second quarter. Sophomore midfielder Buddy Carr punctuated the run with a power play goal as his team turned a 3-3 tie in a commanding 6-3 advantage with three tallies in less than a minute.
“The faceoffs in the second quarter really hurt us,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But we knew if we kept hustling and winning ground balls, we could get back into the game.”
On the other end, Minutemen junior goalie D.J. Smith stifled the Harvard attack with four saves. At halftime, however, it was Smith, and not Crimson sophomore goalie Robert Shaw, that was substituted.
“When we were scouting them, we saw that they usually tried to switch it up with a righty and lefty goalie,” Dwyer said. “It made us take some different angles in the second half, but it didn’t affect us much overall.
In the third quarter, UMass had several chances to pull away, but Dwyer caught fire to keep Harvard in the game almost singlehandedly. Each time the Minutemen seized a four-goal lead, Dwyer got the point back within two minutes. He went on to score three goals in a span of less than seven minutes, and made sure his team entered the fourth quarter still only down by three goals.
Then, just as it did in its previous two games, the Crimson dominated the final period. With a flurry of goals, Harvard tied the game with 5:07 to play. The team has now outscored its opponents 16-6 in the fourth quarter and overtime.
“Part of it is our conditioning, which we have a lot of confidence in,” Dwyer said. “But mostly, it’s the situations we’ve been in, trailing at the end of games, and having a sense of urgency.”
UMass had its last good chance to win the game with three seconds remaining, but Shaw made a save to preserve the 9-9 tie. The stage was then set for Dwyer’s dramatic game-winner, and he delivered.
“We’ve been down for large portions of our games this season, but the team has shown a lot of resolve,” Wojcik said. “Fortunately, so far, we’ve been able to get the right results.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I think the difference between this team and any other team I’ve played for at Harvard is that we never give up, we’re never out of the race,” senior Shilpa Tummala said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a 23-point deficit at Yale or it’s last night and we have to beat it at the buzzer.”
Seven of the Harvard women’s basketball team’s 12 Ivy League games have been decided in the last three minutes of play or overtime. This weekend was no exception.
After giving up a 14-point lead against Yale (12-17, 3-9 Ivy) on Friday, the Crimson’s (14-11, 9-3 Ivy) performance in the last four minutes of the fourth quarter was one to remember. Saturday against Brown (13-13, 1-11) was no different—despite going up by 13 late in the third, a resilient Bears squad found its way back into the game. Ultimately, Harvard was able to hold off both opponents in its last weekend playing at home, picking up a pair of victories over its Ivy opponents.
HARVARD 92, BROWN 79
On a night meant to honor Harvard’s three seniors—AnnMarie Healy, Kit Metoyer, and Tummala—the trio did not disappoint. The group combined for 50 points and 21 rebounds.
Despite the offensive outpouring the Crimson’s win did not come easy. After a slow start, Harvard struggled to build a lead early in the first half.
After shooting just 31 percent through the first frame, Harvard closed the half with a punch—after a three pointer from Brown freshman Shayna Mehta put the Bears within four, freshman Madeline Raster raced down the court and connected from about four feet beyond the arc as the buzzer sounded.  The Crimson closed the half up 39-32.
The late thee wouldn’t be enough to keep Harvard up in the second half. Despite a third quarter that saw the Crimson shoot 62 percent from the field, Brown hung around by forcing turnovers and pressing throughout the second half.
“Tonight they kept changing their full court pressure,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Brown did a nice job mixing up their presses and mixing up what they were doing at the other end. We struggled, we were just back on our heels as far as executing our offense.”
Despite the press, the Crimson managed to hold off the Bears when they came within four with five minutes left in the fourth. Tummala’s back-to-back threes would seal the deal as Harvard extended its winning streak to six games. Tummala finished the game and her career at Lavietes with 24 points and 12 rebounds.
“The seniors have been wonderful leaders, and mentors, and role models,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’ve changed the culture here. This year I felt that the seniors’ persistence and work ethic has been wonderful and inspirational. I have so much respect for their drive and their leadership.”
HARVARD 65, YALE 63
It’s difficult to describe in words what ensued at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday night. Playing against a Yale squad that the Crimson beat on a 23-point comeback in New Haven earlier this year, the Crimson’s second matchup against the Bulldogs didn’t fail to live up to expectations.
“In the last thirty seconds we called a time-out and we were running a dribble drive play just to run the clock down,” co-captain AnnMarie Healy said. “[Sydney Skinner] took it inside, and I dove in—she passed it inside and I missed a layup, but it reset the clock, and I put it in. I had no idea of time, so I was running back on defense.”
The defense wouldn’t be necessary as Healy’s shot went in just as the clock sounded. For the second time this season, Harvard handed Yale a dramatic loss.
The road to the Crimson’s victory was quite different this time around. On Friday, it was Harvard that came out firing. In the first quarter, the Crimson went on an uncontested 14-point run to jump out to a lead of that margin.
After shooting 53 percent from the field and 57 percent from beyond the arc through the first frame, Harvard slowed down in the second and third quarters.
“Once again, and this is problematic of all young teams, we didn’t execute on the offensive end as well as we should have,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought some of our shot selection was absolutely crazy and not good, and they were boxing us out really well.”
With the Crimson’s offense stalling, Yale made a comeback of it’s own. A three followed by a two from junior guard Lena Munzer put the Bulldogs up by four with four minutes to go in the fourth.
Despite the late offense from Yale, freshman guard Sydney Skinner had other plans. She would score eight of Harvard’s last ten points before Healy capped off the Crimson’s run with the game-winner. Healy finished the night with 21 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists.
“We’ve been in this position so many times this year,” junior Destiny Nunley said. “I think that’s kind of how we’re able to figure it out. We’ve been here before, we know what we have to do. We just had to rebound the ball, play extra hard defense, rotate, help the helper. All those little things become so much more important in those last ten minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For its last race of the regular season, the Harvard Alpine and Nordic ski team traveled to Middlebury, Vt., to compete in the NCAA Regional Championships this weekend. Racing against a competitive field of US Ski Team and World Cup racers, the Crimson capped off its regular season several season-best performances with its sixth consecutive top-10 finish.
“This weekend was exciting for us because we had some good results and it was just a super positive atmosphere,” junior Kaitlyn Gibson said.
The team ultimately secured 10th place of sixteen teams to conclude its regular season.
In the alpine races, co-captain Simon Merryweather ended his collegiate skiing career with a season-best finish of 36th of 51 entrants. He was the first Harvard finisher in the Slalom race.
“It might have been his best finish overall considering the caliber of athletes that were at this race,” Gibson said. “That was a really awesome way to bring him to finish, and he was really happy with that result.
Sophomore Pieter Weemaes and senior Dan Rittenhouse followed Merryweather in 47th and 51st, respectively.
“It was a little bit sad because Dan and Simon are seniors so they both had their last race,” Gibson said.
In the men’s Giant Slalom race, Weemaes led the pack with a 2:09.51, good enough for 41st. Rounding out the roster, Merryweather, junior Kalvis Hornburg, junior James Stevenson, Rittenhouse and freshman Dennis Bao finished one after another to take 50th to 54th place.
“Kalvis Hornburg is our rookie and he made some good moves, especially in the second run in the GS,” Gibson said.
On the women’s side, sophomore Kelly Steeves earned her season-best finish of 24th place in the women’s Giant Slalom race.
“I’m really happy, especially with the way I finished. I was super happy that I got top-30 and I had an awesome course for the second run,” the Whistler native said.
Gibson added to the praise of her teammate.
“We’ve seen some fantastic consistency throughout the whole season from her and the team can always rely on her in and out of the course,” Gibson said. “Kelly’s had an awesome season so far and we’re really excited to see what she can do in the next two years.”
Gibson recorded the other Harvard finish in the Giant Slalom at 49th. In the Slalom race, Steeves again led for the Crimson in 44th, followed by Gibson in 53rd and freshman Molly Leavens at 59th.
On the Nordic side, the skiers faced less than ideal conditions. After pouring rain on Wednesday and Thursday, the course was frantically groomed into shape for the races on Friday.
“It was a really hard course, made harder by poor conditions,” co-captain Soren Anderson said. “The races were not particularly strong in terms of results, though we did have a few standout performances.”
One of those performances came from junior Ian Meyer, who registered his first top-25 finish this season, taking 25th place in the 20K Classic. He was followed by a strong showing of Harvard finishes with junior Devlin Shea in 38th, sophomore Liam Mulshine in 47th, Anderson in 49th, sophomore Conor Green in 54th, and sophomore Haakon Sigurslid in 59th.
In the 10K Classic, Shea notched his second top-40 finish of the weekend in 38th with a time of 24:19.3, with Meyer and Green just on his heels at 40th and 41st.
“I think we all had fun this weekend,” Anderson said. “It was a definitely a bittersweet time for all the seniors. I cannot believe that it’s over, and I’m so grateful for everything the team has given me.”
On the women’s side, freshman Hannah Hardenbaugh claimed a season-best finish with a 31st place showing in the women’s 5K FS. Senior Annie Harvieux and junior Rachel Hampton trailed just behind her in 35th and 36th, respectively.
In the 15K Classic, two Crimson racers registered top-20 finishes out of the 68 racers. Junior Rachel Hampton claimed 18th place with a time of 46:19.7 and senior Hanna Barnes clocked in at 19th with a 46:29.4. Hardenbaugh earned a top-30 finish at 28th, followed by junior Maile Sapp in 39th, freshman Nina Armstrong in 45th, and Harvieux in 58th.
“We were quite consistent this season,” Anderson said. “I think this year was a building year for us. We have a lot of great young talent and we’re waiting for them to mature.”
Despite the end of the regular season, the team will continue practicing for post-season races. Hampton is the only Harvard skier who qualified for the NCAA Championships and will travel to Steamboat, Colo., the weekend of March 9th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

This past weekend, the No. 32 Harvard men’s tennis team hosted St. John’s, No.15 Northwestern, and Bryant. After suffering a close loss to St. John’s on Friday, the Crimson fell 7-0 to Northwestern before sweeping Bryant, 7-0, to end the weekend with a win.
HARVARD 7, BRYANT 0
A new lineup against the Bulldogs gave younger Crimson players valuable playing time while also securing a decisive victory for Harvard with wins at every position.
The Crimson secured the doubles point early on with wins from co-captain Conor Haughey and senior Kelvin Lam at second doubles and freshman Christopher Morrow and sophomore Grant Solomon at third doubles.
Solomon, playing first singles, overcame his opponent in a close first set 7-5 before sweeping the second set 6-2. Sophomore Jean Thirouin eked out his Bryant opponent in a tiebreaker in the second set to for a Harvard victory at second singles. Junior Brian Yeung at third singles and Morrow at fourth also took straight-set wins.
After giving up the first set, sophomore Xavier Gonzalez came back to take the next two sets 6-1, 6-2 to win the fifth singles point. To close out the ladder, freshman Michael Peters also fought a hard-won three-set victory, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6.
HARVARD 0, NORTHWESTERN 7
Earlier on Sunday, the Crimson struggled to find its footing against No.15 Northwestern. Harvard lost the doubles point with straight victories from its Wildcats opponents at second and third doubles, leaving first doubles unfinished. Co-Captain Nicky Hu and junior Sebastian Beltrame fell 6-3 to Northwestern sophomores Zieba Konrad and Sam Shropshire, while Haughey and Lam fell 6-2.
At first singles, Hu faced off against Konrad, who is currently ranked eighth in the country by the ITA. Unable to best Konrad, Hu fell 6-3, 6-4.
Beltrame suffered a similar 6-3, 6-4 loss at the hands of Shropshire, currently ranked 73rd in the country, at second singles. At third singles, Kenny Tao pushed his match into a tiebreaker in the third set with a second-set comeback, but he could not overcome Northwestern sophomore Strong Kirchheimer. Tao ultimately fell 6-4, 2-6, 7-5, ending his eight-match win-streak at third singles.
After losing a hard tiebreaker in the first set, Lam could not come back for a win at fourth singles. His loss marked the end of an eight-match win-streak at sixth singles. Freshman Andy Zhou also found himself in a close third set after taking the first set, but could not close the victory and fell 4-6, 7-6, 10-2. Rounding out the roster, Thirouin fell 7-5, 6-2 to his Wildcats opponent.
HARVARD 3, ST. JOHN’S 4
On Friday, the Crimson split the singles points with St. John’s, but suffered a defeat at the doubles point early on, which cost Harvard the win.
Despite a tiebreaker at first singles from Zhou and Yeung, the Crimson could not overcome its opponents and lost at all three doubles positions.
A straight-set loss from Yeung at third singles gave St. John’s another point, but Hu earned the first Harvard point of the day at first singles with a win over St. John’s senior Lucas Hejhal. The Crimson gained momentum as Lam recorded his eighth consecutive win at sixth singles with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over his St. John’s opponent and Tao overcame his opponent in a second-set tiebreaker, 6-3, 7-5.
With Harvard at a 3-2 advantage, it came down to Beltrame at second singles and Zhou at fourth singles. Both Beltrame and Zhou gave up their first sets, and both matches were extremely close in the second set. Beltrame could not close out a tiebreaker and Zhou fell 7-5, however, giving St. John’s two singles points and boosting the Thunderbirds up to 4-3.
Harvard men’s tennis will return to the courts over spring break in La Jolla, CA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 57 Harvard women’s tennis team (5-6) dropped both matches this weekend against William and Mary (8-4, 1-0 CAA) and Old Dominion (5-4).
After last weekend’s sweep of BU, Maryland, and Marist, the Crimson stumbled to two loses in two days down in Virginia: 5-2 against the Tribe, and 4-2 against the Blue.
OLD DOMINION 4, HARVARD 2
The Big Blue came into the match with Crimson in strong form, having won three of its last four. Positive momentum propelled them to a win this weekend against the Harvard team.
This weekend was the first time this season that the Crimson played as the true away team, with all its other contests up to Saturday, taking place in either Harvard’s Murr Tennis Center or in Hanover, N.H. for the ECAC championships.
But for some of Old Dominion’s players, playing away from home means a bit more. The team has just one American player, sophomore Olivia Large who hails from Virginia Beach, VA. The other eight players all hail from eastern and central Europe: two from Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Croatia and one from Slovakia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Against international opposition, the Crimson initially took charge in the doubles. After their loss on Saturday, sophomore Annika Ringblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong came out strong on Sunday morning and beat the Adriana Rajkovic, Natalya Malenko pair 6-4.
The initial success was short lived however. Harvard would drop the next two doubles matches, so again they would go into the singles set of matches down, 1-0.
The Crimson would claim just two points from a possible six in the singles competition. Junior June Lee and  senior Amy He who won for the Harvard, both in straight sets and both with scores of 6-2.
WILLIAM AND MARY 5, HARVARD 2
The weekend kicked off with a Saturday afternoon contest at the McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center in Williamsburg, Va.. After a strong start to the season for 41st-ranked Maryland, the Tribe has cooled off in its last six matches, going 3-3 over that span. Harvard on the other hand, has had good times followed by bad ones, navigating winning streaks then losing ones. For the Crimson, this weekend represented the latter.
The match started with the doubles contest of sophomore Nikki Kallenberg and freshman Isabel Jasper losing convincingly to a strong Tribe pair of Julia Casselbery and Cecily Wuenscher 6-1.
The pair of Ringblom and Xiong fell in a close match to Marie Faure and Elizaveta Nemchinov, losing 4-6.
The Crimson was in the hole early. By dropping the doubles contest, the match score was 1-0. Only once this season had Harvard overcome a 1-0 hole to end in victory, and the team was unable to improve that statistic this weekend.
Lee, Harvard’s number one seed lost in straight sets Nemchinov 6-2, 6-0 . Freshman Erica Oosterhout and He also lost in straight sets. Tallying the two points for the Crimson were Ringblom and Xiong who defeated the Tribe’s Casselbury and Maria Groener in two sets apiece.
The Harvard players know that after this tough weekend, there are some important takeaways.
“Both matches were very close and in both matches there were definitely moments where it looked like we were going to win,” Lee said. “I think we needed to come out a little stronger and more aggressive in doubles in order to get the doubles point since we lost the doubles point both days.”
With Ivies coming up in April, improvement is key, but so is the team’s morale.
“It was a tough loss,” Ringblom said. “We have been working so hard and it is hard to watch us lose two close matches. Although we were not successful this weekend, we have had a lot of success this season and I know this will only push us harder as we prepare for Ivies in April.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a change of pace from the recent Ivy League action, a squad of athletes from Harvard women’s’ swimming and diving trekked to Annapolis, MD for the ECAC championships.
The Crimson competed against old and new opponents, including Navy, UVA, Penn, and Columbia in the open championship meet. The five Harvard competitors totaled 130 points, good for 11th place.
A set of notable performances came from freshman Valerie Yoshimura. With a time of 2:02.93, Yoshimura took third in the 200 IM. She also took eighth in the 400 IM, touching the wall in 4:29.20. The Pennsylvania native also took sixth in the 200 fly with a time of 2:03.60.
Freshman Claire Pinson put up competitive times as well, taking bronze in the 500 free in 4:51.65. In the 400 IM, her 4:22.83 time was good enough for ninth. She also took seventh in the 200 fly, behind Yoshimura.
From the Crimson’s veterans, junior Summer Schmitt competed in a variety of events, showing her skills in events long and short, in a number of different strokes. She took 29th in the preliminaries of the 500 free and 18th in the 100 back. She also took 52nd in 54.61 in the 100 free, adding to the variety of events the junior competed in.
Another veteran, junior Savannah Butler took 15th in the B-final of the 100 breast, with a time of 1:08.25. She also took 15th in the 200 breast, finishing in 2:26.59.
Freshman Holly Christensen also competed, taking 12th in the 50 free, her time of 23.95 edging out the next competitor by 0.04 seconds. She also placed 33rd in the 200 free preliminaries and 41st in the 100 free.
Harvard also competed in several relays. The quad of Yoshimura, Christensen, Schmitt, and Butler took ninth in the 200 medley relay in 1:47.81. In the 400 free relay, Pinson took Butler’s place in the relay team, taking sixth in 3:31.69.

With the Lowell House renovations scheduled to take two years, Dorothy and Diana, the Faculty Deans of Lowell House) are going to have to find an alternative space to hold their weekly teas. House life for Lowell students (and others that make the weekly trek for their fill of tea and desserts) would be severely lacking without this tradition, so it’s imperative that they find a temporary spot for this weekly feeding frenzy. As an avid tea-goer, I have a few suggestions for locations that may provide a suitable temporary home for Tea.
The Inn An oldie but a goodie. This is sort of a no-brainer, especially if Lowell will be using the Inn to house students during the renovation. There’s plenty of space in the entrance and dining hall of the Inn, and access to a kitchen for the tea fairies to work their magic.
The SOCH I’m still not entirely sure what this building is meant for, but I imagine it’s empty except during career fairs. It’s huge, so there would be space for all the quadlings that start attending because it’s in their own backyard. And it’s probably one of the few events that could get the rest of us to make the trek all the way out to the quad.
Flat Patties If they could share the space with Felipe’s, this should work, right?
Hopefully, the Lowell Faculty Deans will take these suggestions into account, but, honestly, as long as there’s still sweet treats and hot tea, I’ll be fine fighting my way through a construction zone for another bite of baked brie.

This evening, as we stood in front of Panera mourning its sudden closing, we overheard an elderly woman put the news best: “Everything is going to hell.”
Truer words have never been spoken, especially after having just finished mourning the losses of local favorites like B.Good, Al’s, and Yenching. Continuing with what seems to be the year of tragic and unexpected restaurant closings, Panera will be the next Harvard Square Staple that is added to the seemingly ever growing list. According to an 8x11 piece of computer paper taped to Panera’s front door, Harvard Square’s Panera Bread Cafe has permanently closed as of today, February 29, 2016. The most sensitive of ways to inform its loyal customers of the this terrible tragedy to top off everyone’s leap day.
