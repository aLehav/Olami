After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May 2019, we, members of Harvard's Class of 2021, watched former Vice President Al Gore deliver a rousing Class Day address to our graduating peers. He spoke of the University’s motto, “veritas,” decrying assaults on truth not only by the Trump administration but also from the fossil fuel industry, which has spent decades misleading the public and fueling climate denial. Gore specifically called on Harvard to divest from the oil and gas companies perpetrating the climate crisis.
"Why would Harvard University continue to support with its finances,” Gore said, “an industry like this that is in the process of threatening the future of humanity?”
Two years later, after our own graduation, we’re still asking the same question. Since Gore’s speech, the fossil fuel industry has continued to peddle false solutions to the climate crisis, doubling down on its exploitative business model while failing to adhere to urgent international emissions targets. According to an October 2020 report from the London School of Economics, no major fossil fuel company has carbon reduction plans compliant with the goals of the Paris Agreement. A similar evaluation from clean energy research group Oil Change International, also released last fall, described major oil companies’ climate commitments as “grossly insufficient,” and far from what is needed to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, per the Paris Agreement.
Investing in these companies contradicts Harvard’s rhetorical commitment to “shaping pathways to a sustainable future.” But as of this spring, the University still has roughly $840 million invested in fossil fuels.
Harvard’s refusal to live up to its sustainability promises compelled us to join Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, which has become our home on campus. As organizers, we’ve built a broad coalition under the shared belief that Harvard must take a stand for our futures and those of marginalized communities around the world. In 2019, we risked arrest by storming the field during the Harvard-Yale football game and protested in front of University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s house. In 2020, we occupied University Hall and the provost’s office. And this year, we filed a historic legal complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General, arguing that Harvard’s fossil fuel investments violate state law.
Our efforts have been widely supported here at Harvard and beyond. Aside from the overwhelming consensus of faculty, students, and alumni in support of divestment, this spring, more than 121 elected officials, climate scientists, economists, alumni, community members, and climate organizations signed onto our legal complaint against Harvard. In late March, Harvard's student government endorsed the complaint, and soon after, student body presidents from every Ivy League university issued a joint statement calling for their universities to divest (Brown, Cornell, and Columbia have already announced divestment commitments). Meanwhile, some of the most influential investors around the world are joining the movement, divesting funds worth trillions of dollars in the last few years alone.
While we are incredibly proud of the support our campaign has received, we are not proud of Harvard’s response. Despite nearly a decade of community calls for divestment, University leadership has refused to seriously consider dropping its oil and gas holdings. The best we’ve gotten is a vague and protracted commitment to decarbonize by 2050 — a plan that Harvard unveiled last year with no interim benchmarks or clear strategy to disrupt the fossil fuel industry’s core business model. And though students have repeatedly offered to work with the administration to find a path toward climate leadership, Harvard is currently refusing to engage in meaningful dialogue — as it has, more or less, for the past decade.
When we arrived on campus as freshmen, Harvard’s Dexter Gate greeted us with an invitation: “Enter to Grow in Wisdom.” Now, as we prepare to graduate, those gates call on us to use what we’ve learned to make the world a better place, urging us to “Depart To Serve better Thy Country and Mankind.” But it is difficult for us to square that request with Harvard’s continued embrace of an industry hell-bent on preserving a destructive status quo.
Our time as college student organizers may now be drawing to a close, but the need for fossil fuel divestment is more urgent than ever. For Harvard to serve its country and humankind, it must disentangle itself from fossil fuels and embrace a just and stable future. But it won’t do so without pressure. That’s why we are pledging to withhold any donations to Harvard until the University announces a commitment to fully divest from the fossil fuel industry.
It’s true that individual action alone isn’t enough to push Harvard to change its investment practices. But consider the material and symbolic impact that we could yield by acting together. In 2018, top universities including Harvard collected more than 44 percent of their financial gifts from individual donors. Indeed, Harvard says our donations are “essential” to its future. It is now time for us to show Harvard that fossil fuel divestment — as a step toward realizing climate and environmental justice — is essential to our future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A record-high 85 percent of admits accepted their offers to join Harvard College’s Class of 2025, meaning the College expects an unprecedented 1,962 freshmen to enroll this fall, it announced Sunday morning.
The 85 percent yield rate represents an uptick from last year’s 81 percent of admits who enrolled in the Class of 2024, and eclipses the previous record-high 84 percent of students matriculated to the Class of 2021.
In addition to the high yield rate among this year’s admitted students, the class is joined by admits from the Class of 2024 who deferred to the Class of 2025 — last year’s 349 deferrals were also a record high due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Members of this year’s admitted class, who replied to the College’s admissions offers by May 3, also experienced Harvard’s highest application numbers and lowest acceptance rate ever.
Unlike in previous years, applicants to the Class of 2025 were not required to submit scores for standardized tests. The College’s test-optional policy will extend to the Class of 2026’s application cycle.
“We are thrilled to welcome the many promising students admitted in the Class of 2025 and look forward to seeing all they accomplish in their years at Harvard,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in Sunday’s press release.
Women make up the majority of the Class of 2025 at 52.6 percent, while men comprise the remaining 47.4 percent. Asian Americans make up 25.3 percent of the class, a slight increase from last year’s 24.6 percent, but close to the record-high 25.6 percent from the Class of 2023.
African Americans comprise 14.3 percent of the Class of 2025, a slight increase from last year’s 13.9 percent. The percentage of Latinx students remained steady at 11.7 percent compared to the previous year’s 11.8 percent, and Native Americans and Native Hawaiians make up 1.5 percent of this year’s` incoming class, a decrease from the 2 percent enrolling last year.
First-generation college students make up 18.6 percent of the Class of 2025, similar to last year’s 18.7 percent. The Class of 2025 also has 18 veterans, a slight increase from the 12 veterans from the Class of 2024.
Approximately 55 percent of the Class of 2025 students will receive need-based aid, meaning families will contribute an average of $12,700. Families with an income of less than $65,000 — 20.7 percent of the class — will pay nothing. The College does not require students on aid to take out loans.
In addition to direct support for costs relating to tuition, room and board, HFAI provides students on full financial aid with $2,000 start-up grants for costs related to transitioning to college.
In 2020, the College announced it would eliminate the summer work expectation for students receiving aid in favor of scholarship funds, and waived the term-time work expectation for the 2020-21 academic year due to the pandemic. Moving forward to the 2021-2022 school year, students will be expected to contribute $3,500 through term-time work to cover their estimated personal expenses.
The College has already announced that all students will be offered housing on and near campus at normal density this fall. It plans to use 1201 Massachusetts Ave. — the former Inn at Harvard — and apartments on Prescott Street to house freshmen, in addition to its typical housing stock.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department is investigating two incidents of vandalism at the Harvard Hillel building that occurred within two weeks of each other in late May and sparked forceful emails from administrators.
On May 18, an HUPD officer took a report of vandalism to a banister outside of Rosovsky Hall — Harvard’s Hillel building located at 59 Plympton Street — per the department’s public crime log. The following week, on May 28, HUPD received another report of vandalism done to a glass panel of Rosovsky Hall’s entryway doors.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow informed Harvard affiliates of the two incidents in a May 28 email, in which he condemned a recent rise in anti-Semitism across the United States. Bacow wrote that HUPD was investigating both incidents.
“People have been beaten for the simple act of wearing a yarmulke. Synagogues have been defaced; Jews have been harassed in the streets; and anti-Semitic social media postings have become common,” he wrote. “In the past two weeks, Harvard Hillel has been vandalized twice.”
The conflict in Israel and Palestine escalated in May to its worst violence since 2014. After Palestinians protested the anticipated eviction of several Palestinian families living in East Jerusalem, Israeli police clashed with Palestinians at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, leaving 300 Palestinians injured. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, responded by launching rockets into Israel, and Israeli forces carried out airstrikes on Gaza.
A cease-fire took effect May 21 following 11 days of airstrikes, which killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and left thousands injured or homeless. Twelve Israeli civilians, including two children, and one Israeli soldier were also killed in the fighting.
Following Bacow’s statement, Harvard Hillel Executive Director Jonah C. Steinberg detailed both instances of vandalism in a pair of emails to Hillel affiliates — the first of which appeared to be committed in response to the recent violence in the Middle East and the other of which was possibly unintentional.
Steinberg wrote that in the first incident a Palestinian flag bearing the phrase “Fuck 12” — seemingly referring to a popularized anti-police slogan — was zip-tied to the front door of Rosovsky Hall. Cameras at the Hillel entrance recorded the two perpetrators, who wore masks and have yet to be identified, according to Steinberg.
Steinberg also wrote he believes sentiments against Israel and law enforcement are related in the minds of some Cambridge residents.
“It bears mentioning in this connection that a Cambridge City Council meeting last week heard public testimony on both a boycott resolution against Israel and a resolution on police-defunding,” Steinberg wrote. “Statements made there reflected a degree to which those issues are linked in the opinions of some Cambridge residents.”
At the May 25 Cambridge City Council meeting, several councilors proposed an order calling for the city to cut ties with companies that have business dealings in Israel, such as Hewlett-Packard, which councilors accused of “abetting apartheid in the Middle East.” The order — which was ultimately amended — touched off passionate public comment that lasted nearly seven hours.
Steinberg reaffirmed Hillel’s mission on Harvard’s campus in an email to The Crimson.
“The essence of Harvard Hillel is a welcoming, inclusive, and resilient togetherness, which I regard as indomitable in the face of hatred and violence,” Steinberg wrote.
Harvard Hillel student president Sabrina P. Goldfischer ’23 wrote in an email to The Crimson that she was “truly horrified” to learn of the incidents.
“In a time when rates of antisemitic incidents across the globe are reaching terrifying spikes, it feels all the more scary when it occurs right at Harvard, especially when the Hillel building represents a home for many in our community,” she wrote. “All students, regardless of background, have a right to feel safe on Harvard’s campus -- seeing the Hillel building become vandalized puts this promise in serious jeopardy.”
Harvard Hillel student leaders also published an open letter condemning anti-Semitism, which had garnered more than 830 signatures from University affiliates as of Monday evening.
Steinberg also detailed the second act of vandalism, which involved a window broken by a thrown object amid a party on Mount Auburn Street, during which multiple objects were thrown along the street.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement May 5 that both incidents are “still being actively investigated” but declined to comment on ongoing investigations, citing HUPD policy.
