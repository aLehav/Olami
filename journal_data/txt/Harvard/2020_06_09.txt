After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
Soon after I was hired by the Harvard Anthropology department in 2002, a tenured woman filled me in on the implicit expectations that were conveyed to her when she had stood in my shoes: perform brilliantly, prove your commitment with costly personal sacrifices, and you might get to stick around. Oh, and be a “dutiful daughter” to the institution: pick up the slack on department “housework” from entitled male colleagues as you gracefully manage their egos, and, possibly, their fumbling advances.
While reading The Crimson’s article on the Anthropology department (May 29), I heard that bitingly trenchant voice again in my mind’s ear. It was clear as day to me then, as it is now, that Professor Mary Steedly had no wish to recruit another “dutiful daughter.” As The Crimson reports, her use of the phrase was referenced in a 2015 lawsuit as an instance of a toxic department culture that enabled routine misogyny and ignored sexual harassment. But when Professor Steedly mentioned the phrase to me, it was to label the pernicious departmental culture she had survived — and it served to raise my defenses against a waning but hardly eradicated mindset.
All allegations of sexual harassment and abuse within the Anthropology department must be fully addressed without delay. But if the potentially transformative measures currently being eyed go forth, as I hope they will, they won’t be solely the outcome of such accusations, or even of new and dynamic departmental leadership. Decades-long efforts to shift institutional culture will deserve as much credit, including fleeting moments like the one described above.
As a junior faculty woman who was structurally vulnerable in the very ways detailed by the article, my first-hand experience of institutional transition adds an important layer to his account. (The reporter and I had planned to speak before his article appeared, but we ran into bad timing and circumstances on my end.) During the 2000s, I watched the tide turn towards gender justice in the Anthropology department and beyond. Like all institutional change, the process unfolded in fits and starts, not just within the department but in tandem with other units and levels of University administration.
This kind of progress is rarely linear. Back in 2007 the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs considered and eventually approved my request to spend research travel funds on childcare — the first time it had done so, I was told. (If this were to become standard practice, it would be a boon for women in disciplines that entail extended fieldwork.) Yet even as the Center eased the way for me to launch new research with my family in tow, its previous director, Jorge I. Dominguez, was apparently engaging in serial acts of sexual harassment, for which he was eventually sanctioned by the University.
By the time I left Harvard in 2011, largely for reasons unrelated to the matters at hand, several forms of implicit biases and barriers to women’s success were widely acknowledged. Clearly, abuses did not cease. But dissent, generational turnover, and leadership at several levels of the institution were forcing the renegotiation of norms and expectations affecting female Ph.D. students and junior faculty. Much of this was due to the University-wide efforts, formal as well as informal, of senior women like Professor Steedly, who had achieved promotion after running the gauntlet of rampant sexism and were determined to dismantle it. Male allies — yes, including some who later faced allegations — made positive contributions as well. It’s complicated.
I hope Harvard will hasten and support the Anthropology department’s current efforts to address gender inequity through new hires and support systems. The fact that Harvard, for better or worse, remains the cynosure of eyes across higher education only raises the stakes. I am keenly aware that resource-poor public universities like my current home institution probably won’t be in a position to follow suit. Still, Harvard’s actions either way will exert influence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard police chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley will step down from his post by the end of the calendar year, he announced in an emailed statement to the department Monday.
Riley, 74, will retire both after a turbulent quarter-century leading the Harvard University Police Department, and amid nationwide protests against police brutality. Prior to joining HUPD in 1996, Riley worked as a lieutenant colonel for the Massachusetts State Police.
Earlier this year, The Crimson published an investigation into Riley’s department that found repeated racist and sexist incidents inside the force spanning nearly three decades. In court documents, discrimination complaints, and interviews, roughly 20 current and former officers alleged he established a toxic culture inside the department that favored certain officers and retaliated against others who spoke up against their perceived mistreatment.
Riley subsequently set in motion a review of the department led by external law enforcement experts, which is still underway. That review has been criticized by the executive board of Harvard’s police union.
Riley’s statement did not directly refer to the department’s internal issues, or to the murder of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police on Memorial Day, an incident which has sparked protests across the country calling for the abolition of local police forces, including HUPD. Harvard officers have also been the subject of criticism for assisting the Boston Police Department at one such protest.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a statement that he is grateful to Riley for his work leading HUPD. He added that Harvard plans to conduct a national search for a new police chief.
“I want to thank Chief Riley for his 25 years of service to Harvard and for his devotion and dedication to the security and safety of the Harvard community. At all times he has shown a deep commitment to the HUPD, the university and its mission, and to our community of faculty, students and staff,” Bacow wrote.
Riley wrote that he was honored to lead the department, referencing his work to move HUPD toward a community-policing model.
“When I began my tenure at Harvard, the campus was experiencing turbulence and extreme tension between the HUPD and the Harvard community,” he wrote. “We implemented new sensitivity training for our officers, made procedural changes in our policing culture, strategy, and tactics as well as hiring practices to recruit more minority and women candidates, and improve their career development and path to promotion.”
Riley also made an indirect mention of “events and issues that have arisen recently.”
“We must acknowledge the work that is needed on our part to strengthen the trust of our community, and specifically the trust of people of color and others in our community who have been marginalized,” he wrote. “That requires that, as a Department, we take the time to be both introspective in reviewing our culture, training and procedures, while also being open to the important conversations that we must have with our community as we pursue this goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After eight months of a United States Senate primary race being defined by policy similarities and friendly jabs, incumbent U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) finally removed the gloves Monday night.
In a debate that marked a shift in a sometimes somnolent campaign, Kennedy and Markey sparred over their respective records and progressive credentials. The normally mild-mannered Markey went after his youthful opponent from the opening bell, accusing him at one point of being “a progressive in name only.”
Kennedy fired back, questioning Markey’s effectiveness even on some of his signature issues, such as climate change and Alzheimer’s disease research. Kennedy also challenged Markey’s “long-standing record of judgement” on racial justice issues, pointing to his vote in favor of the 1994 Crime Bill while he was a member of the U.S. House and his past opposition to busing in order to integrate Boston public schools.
“The laws and the structures that have come down as a boot on the neck of communities of color, those are not an accident,” Kennedy said. “They were deliberate, they were intentional, and they came in by choice. And you might be known for some things in your time in office, Senator — racial justice and criminal justice is not one of them.”
Markey disputed the assertion with fervor throughout the debate, which was hosted by WPRI-TV, Gannett’s Massachusetts publications, and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Markey went after Kennedy’s work as an assistant district attorney under Cape Cod District Attorney Michael D. O’Keefe, a Republican, following his 2009 graduation from Harvard Law School.
“He could’ve worked for anyone,” Markey said. “He decided to go and work for a right-wing Republican who opposes the kind of progressive changes that we’re looking for. That was a choice which Congressman Kennedy made with his legal career. That’s who he worked for. That was not the right place for a progressive to be working.”
“Senator, I’m glad to see that you’re paying attention to these issues now,” Kennedy retorted. “You’ve been in office for 47 years at the state system and the federal system.”
Kennedy said he “had big differences of agreement” with O’Keefe when he worked for him, but defended working in his office.
Still, the pair found few issues they could disagree about. They both expressed support for the reallocation of at least some police department funding to other public services. They both said they wanted to abolish the electoral college. And they both said they’re in favor of various forms of student debt forgiveness in response to a question from UMass Dartmouth Chancellor Robert E. Johnson.
“I was watching two people who agree on nearly every issue of significance to Democratic primary voters try to get a five- and 15- or 30-second clip to put in a Facebook ad,” said John Cluverius, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
“The more complicated the differences between the two candidates become, the more complicated and difficult it is for voters to make up their minds,” he added. “With that factor combined with the fact that there are at least three or four big, national news stories that are long-term distracting voters from this race, it adds so many elements of uncertainty in a campaign that kind of started pretty uncertain already. So the only way these candidates can punch through is by going negative.”
Cluverius said that the debates, which may garner little attention amid multiple national crises, remain important because they provide “a setting that feels more comfortable to go on the attack.”
“I think the advantage in a normal election would go to Kennedy,” Cluverius said. “The problem is that this isn’t going to be a normal election. As long as there’s some measure of social distancing in place by the time we get to the primary — as long as the pandemic is still raging — there are forces at work in this election that neither candidate can control.”
