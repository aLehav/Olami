After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you didn’t known that HLS had a seal, much less one honoring a vicious slaveholder, and reacted by thinking, “That’s messed up, why don’t we change that?” (or words to that effect), then we come from common ground. It has taken me some reflection, aided by the fiery reasoning of Royall Must Fall, to realize this issue’s importance.
The omnipresence of racial hierarchy is such that its signs are rarely noticed or rebuked. This has long been the case with the HLS seal. While such neglect is troublesome, it has also meant that the racial subtext of the Royall seal is not an accurate reflection of HLS. However, it would become much more of one if, in spite of the pain and protests it causes, HLS still clung to this valueless symbol.
Given that Royall is less a crucial donor than a unique one (the first), there is no good reason to honor him. Brutal racial subjugation is a serious taint, no matter the era, and one proportional to its share in a person’s life. The wealth that lends Royall any significance came almost entirely from the toil and blood of slaves. We know that he owned the most people in Massachusetts, had dozens tortured and executed in Antigua, and that, more likely than not, “the half has never been told.” Against this history is a family mascot that reinforces pre-Revolutionary notions of aristocracy. The only possible basis for Royallism is traditionalism.
While some have defended such orthodoxy on the grounds that "a great institution can tell the truth about itself," members of Royall Must Fall also wish to increase awareness of the tradition embodied in our seal. But they realize that three cartoonish sheaves of wheat are less an educative reminder of Harvard’s racist past than a sign of its racist present. Racially tinged markers seldom spread awareness. After all, surprisingly few HLS students know about the (in)famous Roger Taney portrait in the Reading Room of Langdell, and even fewer appreciate the irony of the figure across from it—pointing blithely, it seems, in secret alliance—HLS alum and President Rutherford Hayes, who ended Reconstruction and accelerated the South’s “Redemption” reign of terror.
The truth is we don’t need the names or insignias of racists to remind us of slavery or Jim Crow. We see it every day in mass incarceration, police shootings, childhood poverty and the $20 bill (just to get the list started). Why add insult and injury by forcing African-American students to attend schools that pay unqualified tribute to virulent white supremacists? That’s not educating people about history. It’s perpetuating a hostile educational environment.
For those with a traditionalist bent, this line of argument may be compelling on a case-by-case basis, but it raises the prospect of a slippery slope. If we change our seal, if Washington renames its Redskins and Princeton its Woodrow Wilson School (a closer but correct call), where does the purge end? As some conservatives have challenged, “Should Washington, DC, named after a slave owner, adopt a new title?” This concern, at once overblown and condescending, mistakenly assumes that raging activists cannot see shades of gray or pick and choose their battles. It also ignores the frequent availability of compromise. Certain symbols and names are less suited for certain honors—like Jefferson-Jackson Day for today’s Democratic Party—than they are for others. Many markers of racist structures and legacies will remain.
If there is a slippery slope, it cuts the other way. For Royallists, where do you draw the line? Was it wrong for South Carolina to remove the Confederate Flag from its State Capitol, or for the University of Texas to move its Jefferson Davis statue from a central pedestal to an historical collection?
The traditionalist resentment of such actions rests partly on the misimpression that they are common, that the pendulum has swung too far the other way. Brown historian Michael Vorenberg, a principal source for the movie “Lincoln,” summarized this well. While a member of a committee that investigated Brown's debt to slavery, Vorenberg heard the repeated complaint, “Why do we always have to talk about slavery?” He responded, “When do we talk about slavery?” Asking this question would give many of us pause, as it has given me. Slavery may often be “the thought behind our thoughts,” but it seldom reaches our lips. Confronting the Royall seal is a chance to speak and act out our conscience.
In doing so, we would do well to remember that, while symbols of history matter greatly, they are trivial compared to concrete injustices, including the fact that roughly 750,000 black men are currently in adult jails or prisons, and that as long as this system remains in place, one in three born today will someday go to prison. This should not detract from Royall Must Fall. But it might inspire us to carry our work beyond elite institutions, to reach the greatest victims of racial oppression.
And yet the debate here at Harvard takes me back to my time teaching in Jackson, Mississippi (yes, through Teach For America). I lived blocks from the James Eastland Courthouse, drove to school on George Wallace Drive and jogged afterward along the Ross Barnett Reservoir, at the last sometimes thinking, “Things will only change so much while there are Ross Barnett Reservoirs.” It will be progress—however belated and slight—if the Royall seal falls. And it will give HLS a rare chance to reflect on its ideals and do more to live by them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reflecting on the fact that this is my last column, I was tempted to try my hand at writing something of a masterpiece. Like a siren, this column had been calling out for me to attempt a grand reflection, either of my own work, that of my fellow columnists, or of something even more general. It would be nice, I thought to myself, to end the semester with a bang—to write something that might leave a lasting mark and affect the discourse of our little Harvard world. But the profound thought that such a column requires eludes me, and besides, I don’t think I am competent enough a writer to accomplish such a magnificent task. Instead, I found my head filled with a number of observations—columns waiting to be born, if you will—and I thought I would use this opportunity to share them.
First, my writing coincides with Hanukkah, perhaps the most visible Jewish holiday here in America. But this is strange, because Hanukkah is, from a traditional Jewish perspective, not a major holiday. It pales in comparison to Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, Passover, Sukkos, and a host of others. So why is Hanukkah always one of the first things associated with Jews in the public imagination? The answer turns out to be, in part, that American Jews used Hanukkah to assimilate into America. Because of its calendrical proximity to one of America’s most celebrated holidays, Christmas, American Jews promoted and even added to the holiday to associate it with Christmas. For example, the institution of gift giving, which American Jews used to associate with Purim, was shifted to Hanukkah. (Although it is a long standing custom to give children gelt, or money, on Hanukkah, gifts seem to be something altogether different.)
This has had the dual and perhaps paradoxical effects of allowing Jews to better assimilate into America and embrace—or for some reconnect to—their Judaism. Hanukkah is light on rules and heavy on food and games. It is an easy way to connect with a tradition that at times may seem onerous. Hanukkah can be both a symbol of assimilation and a beckoning of tradition. This is, of course, ironic. But it is all the more ironic when one considers the meaning of Hanukkah, that is, the events it commemorates. Hanukah is a celebration of a revolt lead by Judah Maccabee against the Seleucid Empire, which tried to force Jews to Hellenize. The Maccabee Revolt did not only target the Seleucids, but also a group of Jews—the Mityavnim—who acquiesced to the Seleucids and accepted their ways. Hanukkah, in other words, is a celebration of Jewish resistance against assimilation, and of Jewish insistence to keep its practices.
I do not bemoan Hanukkah’s status as a tool of assimilation. Nor do I reject Jewish assimilation, or any assimilation for that matter. In any state as large as America, assimilation is a necessary and productive force. The irony, without needing to be a criticism, is interesting, and should give us a moment to pause and think about what other things change dramatically over time.
Second, after the recent tragedy in San Bernardino, there has been a lot of talk about gun control, or the lack thereof. As the token conservative for many of my friends, I have been asked several times about my thoughts on the issue. I think a lot of the dialogue on the issue here at Harvard is one sided in favor of more gun control. Before having any conversation on the issue it is important to point out what Senator Marco Rubio said (and what was confirmed by the Washington Post’s famed fact-checker Glenn Kessler) that no recent mass shootings would have been prevented by proposed gun laws. People on either side of the argument can go to their favorite blog, memorize a set of statistics that supports their position, and rattle them off when challenged. I am not saying that there is no right answer, only that we all should be more cautious and open-minded when debating such a polarizing issue.
It might be helpful to think about the issue in different terms. David Foster Wallace, in a short piece for The Atlantic, asked us if “some things are still worth dying for.” He offered a thought experiment: Let’s assume that there is no way to prevent terrorist attacks without encroachments on our civil liberties, but without those encroachments we can get by with “a certain baseline vulnerability to terrorism.” Would the deaths that arise from that vulnerability be a price we can stomach paying for the sort of freedom Americans were once accustomed to?
After the recent string of tragedies, I found myself coming back to that piece. We can run the same thought experiment for guns. Note, this assumes a lot: that guns are to blame; that gun control laws would work; that there exists a right to own whatever gun one wishes. Despite those assumptions, it gets at something crucial that is often overlooked. Gun ownership is part of large swaths of American culture, and many Americans cherish their guns. To take them away is to do violence to their way of life. At the same time, guns menace, maim, and kill. A thoughtful dialogue on the subject should acknowledge both facts. And it is interesting to think about how those on the right and those on the left answer these questions, both Wallace’s experiment and my spin on it, in perhaps inconsistent ways.
As Kanye West said of the beat for his collaborative song with Jay-Z "The Joy," it deserves “the Holy Trinity.” What for him constituted that Trinity is not fitting for the eyes of polite readers, but the point comes across loud and clear: The best things come in threes. So, for a third and final reflection, I want to talk a little bit about Donald Trump.
Much has been said about him and his controversies, and I do not want to write what has already been written just for the sake of seeing myself write it. Instead, I want to briefly focus on a point that has been underemphasized: Trump is no Republican. The Republican Party, at least since Reagan, has been a conservative party. It supports a limited federal government, free markets, and a proud America. And it cleaves to God, championing faith. Nothing about Trump is consistent with those principles. Take some of his most controversial positions.
Immigration: Trump’s plans to deal with illegal aliens—a real problem—will cost hundreds of millions of dollars (if not more) and dramatically increase the size of the federal government. His support of mass deportation would require a Washington behemoth. The impulse, when examining a problem, to first look to Washington and have faith in an expanded federal bureaucracy is foreign to Republicans.
Islam: In the wake of September 11th, and throughout his presidency, Bush took pains to make clear that America was at war with radicalism, not with Islam. Why I am most proud to say I am a Republican is because the GOP is the party of that bedrock American principle, religious liberty. Trump’s remarks critical of all Muslims run against that sentiment, and his vision of a federal database of Muslims is not only repugnant to the Republican religious impulse, but it is also an anathema to the party’s vision of a smaller federal government.
Looking back at these observations, I think something of a common thread emerges. They all, to some degree, deal with things that are unexpected or unusual: the irony of Hanukkah; the incommensurable tensions of the gun-control debate; the anti-conservatism of Trump. The lesson I derive from all this is to be cautious and humble. I often find things to be a lot more complex and subtle after I have thought them over for some time than I do after examining them one or even several times. I wonder if our dialogue would be more productive and less harsh if there were less of an impulse to say we understand things to the fullest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I passed a man near the Harvard Square T stop yelling “Deport all Muslims,” all I could think about was the sturdy build of history, too powerful to waver despite the strongest attempts at human ingenuity.
That’s probably my favorite thing about history—how we think we’re smarter than it. Like dogs proudly strutting back to their owners, ball in mouth, only to chase after it again. Like 13-year olds entranced by the new glamour of teenhood, too cool to dwell on a youth that’s as dull as it is irrelevant.
So, I reject the idea that’s been gaining momentum that as a nation we suffer from collective memory loss. Rather it’s the far more insidious belief that history doesn’t matter—the arrogant tendency to trivialize the most immutable of human patterns, to think that circumstances can ever be exceptional.
When Donald Trump called to block all Muslim immigration, to prevent American Muslims abroad from re-entering the United States, and to create “systems” to track Muslims in the country, he recognized our smug conception of history, and exploited it. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this election cycle is that Donald Trump is the smartest candidate in the field. He places his imprimatur on repackaged incarnations of ugly human id, older than our country itself, and like any good capitalist or deity, he just sits back and gloats in his omniscience, watching the American people scramble like ants as they recycle old fears under new pretenses.
Equally as predictable is the justification that follows up: We’re at war (with Muslims?), the Muslim community hasn’t done enough to condemn radical Islam, and, my personal favorite, “things are different now.”
Things are different now. This is Trump’s lifeblood. Somewhere deep in his rhetorical excreta is a very deftly constructed manipulation of our blindness to history’s lessons. He doesn’t outright invoke Nazi propaganda or Japanese internment because of the blatant moral repulsion but instead dances around it until our obsession with the specious novelty of the present reconciles the cognitive dissonance for him. Trump says, on the subject of Japanese internment during World War II, “I would have had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer. I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer.” Echt-Trump: championing circumstances over concepts, presenting history as a series of pivotal and unprecedented crossroads.
This dangerous brand of moral relativism has a single end, though: Making America great again. Even this, despite appearances, does great disservice to history. Trump paints history as a perfect standard through which we measure the import of present problems rather than an imperfect one through which we diagnose mistakes and find solutions. How exactly will Trump’s solutions solve our problems? It doesn’t matter. At least he’s doing something to address issues we’ve never seen before.
Trump shares this anti-intellectual conception of history with an unlikely group—the Harvard Housemasters, who also trivialize the pedagogical function of the past in the relentless pursuit of betterment. It’s almost cruel that they announced their (unanimous!) decision to change the name of their title the day I first shared my thoughts on sanitizing history in my column two weeks ago, but I find consolation in the amusement of asking them the same questions as The Donald:
Isn’t there something scary about changing the record? Isn’t history about remembering the good, but also the bad?  Unless you prescribe to Mr. Trump’s worldview, America wasn’t always great—slavery, Woodrow Wilson’s racism, and the myriad times we discriminated against ethnic and religious groups of immigrants or even citizens come to mind as compelling examples.
I find value in the connection I feel between the title of House master and the institution of American slavery—it keeps me honest; it keeps me hungry. Rather than papering over this history, I challenge the House masters to learn from it to address real racial problems that exist today. I also find value in someone like Donald Trump to the end that he shows us that his isn’t a society we want to be in. In the words of Robert Fisk, “The only lesson we ever learn is that we never learn.” Hopefully Donald Trump will teach us a thing or two.
Most likely though, he won’t. Our fear of Muslims and residential titles will run its course until it reaches the irretrievable depths of the past: static, harmless, barely a speck in the wistful past. We will move on. History will turn back her clock, but we won’t notice. We’ll be too distracted by the enchantments of a timeworn present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, Tessa Lowinske Desmond—coordinator of the Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights program—hosted a two hour-long meeting to draw attention to the need for an Asian and Pacific American Studies secondary track. Such an endeavor would entail hiring more tenured professors from relevant fields of study and offering more undergraduate courses taught through the lens of Asian and Pacific American history. Lowinske and a group of supportive students make these demands following the inaugural first semester of a secondary field program in Latino Studies in the College’s Romance Languages and Literatures department.
In light of the fact that there is significant interest on campus from both the faculty and student body in creating this program, we are excited to see that the College supports the working group exploring the possibility of an Asian and Pacific American studies field. The college should certainly institute either a pertinent track within EMR or a full-on secondary. In doing so, the faculty should be careful to meld student suggestion with advice and direction from members of the community who are better qualified to shape the program.
To be sure, the current absence of an Asian American studies track does not suggest a disinterest in the topic on the College’s part—nor does the lack of any other, similarly specific program. The absence of a subfield should not be taken to reflect an institutional prejudice against studying a certain type of history, but rather an indication that the demographic interested in studying that type is smaller than others or, in this case, newly vocal.
That said, the establishment of Asian American studies at Harvard should be a top priority. At this stage, it is important to the ultimate formation of the secondary field that students remain vocal about their support. As we have seen with the formation of the African American studies department in 1969 and the more recent development of the Latino Studies pathway, continued student support and clamor is integral to the timely formation of new departments.
Still, the formation of such a department is no easy feat, and in the coming months it would be unrealistic to expect immediate change. Even if the College itself is completely committed to these endeavors, the administration may be bogged down by more trenchant, field-related biases and problems that stall progress. It is in the best interests of potential students of Asian- and Pacific-American Studies that the College take time and put care into developing the department and hiring faculty to it.
We trust that the working group and the administration will put due thought and time into creating a valuable department that stands on par with preexisting departments, and we look forward to what will come for Asian American studies at Harvard.

Cambridge locals and Harvard affiliates took a break from holiday shopping in shopping malls and large commercial franchises Saturday, instead perusing handmade craft gifts at the annual Harvard Square Holiday Fair on Church Street.
The fair, which has operated every year since 1986, drew many of the same loyal customers and vendors as in years past.
“Wild horses could not keep me from this fair,” said Judia R. Ziegler, who has traveled to Cambridge from Vermont every year for 14 years to sell her homemade lotions and salves. “This is by far the most beautiful group of people, vendors, and customers alike.”
Many customers said they are drawn to the fair because of the personal shopping experience and the unique handmade products, which include body products, clothing, glassware, ceramics, and prints.
Jo M. Solet, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor, has attended the fair with her husband Maxwell “Mike” D. Solet ’70 every year for at least 25 years, she said.
“You know that your relatives from somewhere else are not going to have these things, they’re not going to have seen them, so they’re special for them,” she said. “I support the local artist, which is important.”
This year’s Holiday Fair differs from those in the past because of a change in location. The fair was previously located in the basement of the First Parish Church, a space which will be turned into a student-run shelter for homeless young adults. Now, a handful of vendors greet patrons outside the church, but the majority of stalls are set up in a space at 50 Church Street. After Dec. 18, the fair will operate at St. Paul’s Church.
It’s a better use of space than what we were doing there,” said Richie W. Bittner, a vendor at the fair. “We were only there one month a year.”
According to Bittner, the relocation has caused some turnover among the vendors.
“Some old friends who used to be reliable vendors here didn’t come back, some because of the change and some because it was time to move on,” he said.
Bittner added that he does not think that the change in location has not deterred the fair’s loyal customer base.
“I see plenty of old friends,” he said.

The U.S. Senate confirmed former School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray as director of the Department of Energy’s Office of Science on Thursday.
Murray, who served as dean of SEAS from 2009 until her resignation in 2014, was nominated by President Obama in August and has been awaiting Senate confirmation since then. According to Michael S. Lubell of the American Physical Society, a nonprofit group that lobbies Congress on issues pertaining to physics, the Senate approval was not expected. 
“[The confirmation process] gets caught up in some very nasty partisan politics,” Lubell said. “It’s actually somewhat of a miracle that Cherry Murray’s nomination went through.”
President Obama’s previous nominee for the post, MIT professor Marc A. Kastner was nominated in November 2013, but never achieved Senate approval or received a confirmation vote. In an email, Murray called her confirmation “a pleasant surprise.”
Funded by $5 billion from the federal budget, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science oversees national laboratories and supports research on energy and in the physical sciences. The director of the office, according to Lubell, is the equivalent of an Assistant Secretary position in other government departments.
Murray, who became Dean of Harvard’s newest school in 2009, mentioned the role in the number of Harvard undergraduates interested in engineering and computer science growing “dramatically” in her October testimony to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
According to Lubell, having a Senate-confirmed director as opposed to an interim one lends the Office of Science more “strength and credibility within both the halls of Congress and within the administration.”
“If you’re going to wage budget battles within the [Office of Management and Budget]f, you need that Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation,” Lubell said.
While he said Murray’s confirmation comes too late for her to have much role in the budgetary proposal process for this coming year or the next, Murray wrote that “there is work to do to institutionalize many of the advances [Department of Energy] Secretary Ernest J. Moniz has started.”

As many students clamber to finish bibliographies and extend term papers onto that last page, some have had to add a new sentence to final assignments for the first time this fall.
During final exams, and on final papers and assignments, undergraduates have starting affirming their awareness of Harvard College’s first honor code, which went into effect this semester.
The Office of Undergraduate Education now requires students to sign statements affirming that they are aware of the new academic integrity policy on all seated final exams, according to Elisabeth L. Laskin, an assistant dean of undergraduate education. Attendance confirmation forms now require students to sign that declaration in accordance with the honor code. 
The honor code and its attached student-faculty Honor Council, the new disciplinary board charged with enforcing the policy, made their debut this semester after years of extensive planning and a high-profile cheating scandal that originally involved more than 100 students in 2012. From the start of the semester, administrators and students have tried to publicize the policy, about which some undergraduates and faculty members have voiced skepticism. Student members of the Honor Council wore matching shirts at events, created a Facebook page for the group, and expanded outreach to dining halls, courses, and other events.
Laskin wrote in an email that administrators have asked that faculty notify students to include affirmations of integrity on final assignments. Administrators provided faculty with a sample statement—“I affirm my awareness of the standards of the Harvard College Honor Code”—but professors may modify the pledge, according to the honor code’s website.
Many professors, from classes spanning the University’s expansive course catalog, have carried out such requests.
In a take-home final for Philosophy 34: “Existentialism in Literature and Film,” professor Sean D. Kelly added a spot on the front page of his exam for students to sign the affirmation. Kelly said he included the affirmation after students said they wanted a take-home exam.
“It was my idea,” Kelly said. “I suppose [the honor code] was part of what made me think it might be an interesting experiment, but it was also just that I wanted to give the students the opportunity for a take-home exam… and I wanted to give them some guidance about what the constraints were.”
Kelly said he thinks the affirmation of integrity signature requirements will help remind students of the limitations for his take-home exam.
“I would realize the seriousness of [academic integrity] if I had to not only read the instructions, but sign my name saying that I followed them,” added Kelly, who also leads a committee tasked with reviewing the College’s program on General Education.“It helps the students to involve themselves in the act of holding themselves up to those constraints.”
Some students said they were more skeptical that signing an affirmation of integrity is effective in curbing academic dishonesty.
Amanda Lin ’16, who signed the pledge already on two exams, said she had “no opinion” on the new protocol. She said students inclined to cheat will do so, regardless of whether they sign the affirmation statement.

A panel of judges denied a pro-affirmative action group’s motion to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit against the College Wednesday, ruling that Harvard’s lawyers would adequately represent the group’s interests in court. The judges instead granted the students amicus status in the case, allowing them to submit briefs and participate in oral arguments. Lawyers representing the group could not be reached for comment. 
The group, which comprises nine prospective and four current students at the College, as well as one alumnus, filed a motion last April to intervene in the lawsuit accusing Harvard of employing race-based discrimination in its admissions processes. In its initial motion, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice—the pro bono legal group representing the students—wrote that the students could offer personal testimonies to the value of diversity that Harvard, as an institution concerned with its reputation, could not.
In Wednesday’s ruling, however, the circuit court judges wrote that the group’s claims of inadequate representation by the College “buckle at the outset.” Because both the student group and Harvard have an interest in maintaining current affirmative action practices, they wrote, the groups have a “congruence in goals” that would nullify the need for an intervention.
The ruling is the latest development in the lawsuit accusing the College of setting quotas on Asian applicants and target percentages for underrepresented minorities in its undergraduate admissions process. Filed in November 2014, the lawsuit has been put on hold pending the outcome of the affirmation action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, currently under re-consideration at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Lawyers’ Committee began gathering input for its motion to intervene from students in an off-the-record meeting earlier this year in April. Neither Harvard nor Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group suing the College, supported the motion when it was filed.
In their ruling, the judges upheld Harvard’s and SFFA’s objections. Quoting a September speech by University President Drew G. Faust, the judges added that Harvard has “publicly characterized the lawsuit through its highest officials as a threat to its ‘most fundamental values.’”
In its motion to intervene, the pro-affirmative action group argued that they differed from the College in that they did not have to defend the College’s consideration of legacy status in admissions, which may negatively impact minority students. Were the group to criticize Harvard’s legacy preferencing in court, the judges wrote, the intervention “would seem more likely to hinder rather than to help the pursuit of the very goal they share with Harvard.”
Edward Blum, the anti-affirmative action advocate spearheading both the lawsuit against Harvard and Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, said he was unsurprised by the ruling.
“It was widely anticipated by most observers that the First Cir[cuit] would rule against the intervenors,” he wrote in an email.

By 2030, Cambridge could experience triple the number of days each year with temperatures above 90 degrees because of the effects from climate change, according to a recent city report.
The report, dubbed the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment, found that several pieces of Cambridge’s key infrastructure, including transit, emergency services, and telecommunications, are at risk because of increasing heat. 
Subway and commuter rail lines in particular are vulnerable, according to the report, which notes that exposure to extreme heat is likely to damage rails and supporting electrical equipment. Likewise, many Cambridge fire stations currently lack air conditioning to keep occupants and heat-sensitive equipment cool during heat waves.
The report estimates that a city-wide disaster, such as a flood causing a power failure, has the potential to cause $43 million in economic losses per day.
Officials discussed the first part of the two-part assessment, released in November, at a public meeting at the Cambridge Public Library two weeks ago.
“We need to be talking regionally with federal and state authorities who can help us prevent that type of catastrophe,” Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said.
The second part of the assessment, slated for release in February, will address other climate concerns, including the risk of flooding from rising sea levels and storm surges.
The assessment will serve as a guide to Cambridge’s upcoming Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Plan, an initiative designed to address the city’s vulnerabilities, especially with regards to increasing temperatures and precipitation-driven flooding.
According to John Bolduc, an environmental planner for the Cambridge Community Development Department, city officials will start on the plan in January and expect it to take about two years to develop.
According to Bolduc, the project will entail risk-reduction strategies on several scales: improving buildings, planning neighborhoods, and some larger city-wide approaches. The city will conduct the project in conjunction with Cambridge’s Citywide Plan, which focuses on promoting long-term sustainability and living conditions in the city.
“There’s a lot of things you have to do all at one time or in combination to be effective,” Bolduc said. “The effort will be trying to come up with all of those things and put it together in a meaningful way.”
The project will likely begin in the Alewife area, which officials have identified as a higher-risk flooding area.
“There's clearly already a lot of momentum behind this work,” Mazen said. “The next steps are to continue meeting and convening, continue talking about the technical infrastructure areas of greatest needs, and begin formulating a policy solution as a part of the master planning process.”

This is Part II in a two-part series on The Crimson’s survey on College residential life. Part I  ran on Friday.
Harvard touts its residential House system as the cornerstone of upperclassman student life, but only 12 percent of respondents to a recent Crimson survey of undergraduates reported being very involved in their Houses. A plurality, 43 percent, reported being somewhat involved, while 35 percent reported being not very involved and 10 percent not at all involved.
Of all the Houses, respondents from Winthrop reported the highest level of involvement with House life (66 percent described themselves as very or somewhat involved); more than 60 percent of respondents from Adams, Lowell, and Quincy also reported being very or somewhat involved. Respondents from Mather, meanwhile, reported the lowest levels of being very or somewhat involved, at 33 percent. 
The survey also asked respondents about their House Committees, or “HoCos,” groups of students that plan events such as study breaks and formals for undergraduate residents. A plurality of respondents, 33 percent, said they occasionally attend HoCo meetings, while 9 percent always attend, 26 percent sometimes attend, and 32 percent never attend them.
Harvard administrators have increasingly questioned the place of off-campus social groups at the College and their impact on on-campus student life. Surveyed students who reported being members of a final club reported slightly lower levels of House involvement compared to the average: 11 percent reported being very involved, 34 percent somewhat involved, 38 percent not very involved, and 17 percent not at all involved with their Houses. 
Conducted by The Crimson, the survey was emailed to College sophomores, juniors, and seniors on Oct. 25 and closed on Nov. 8, garnering responses from 1,128 students, just under a quarter of upperclassmen. The Crimson did not adjust the survey results for any possible selection bias.
The survey asked upperclassmen dozens of questions on topics ranging from their thoughts on Harvard’s ongoing House renewal project to their experiences on Housing Day, residential advising, and facilities. Survey results indicate that most students are generally satisfied with House resources, although they may not be involved with their residences day-to-day.
Each House offers residents an array of in-House advising resources, ranging from residential tutors who specialize in sexual assault and sexual harassment response, BGLTQ advising, and race relations to pre-professional advisers and the House’s academic deans.
Overall, 59 percent of students surveyed reported feeling satisfied with their House advising resources, while 24 percent reported feeling neutral and 16 percent reported feeling dissatisfied.
- Twenty-four percent reported feeling very satisfied and 35 percent somewhat satisfied, while 11 percent reported being somewhat dissatisfied and 5 percent reported being not at all satisfied. 
- Thirty-two percent of surveyed students reported having sought out academic advice from their House dean. Twenty-one percent reported seeking out advice once, and 11 percent did multiple times.
- Twenty percent of surveyed students reported having sought out non-academic, personal advice from their House dean. Twelve percent of respondents said they had sought out advice once, while 8 percent had multiple times.
- Winthrop House respondents reported the highest level of overall satisfaction with their House advising resources (69 percent), followed by Quincy (68 percent), Currier (65 percent), and Adams (64 percent).
- Students surveyed from Dunster House, which attracted criticism from students who voiced concerns about its BGLTQ advising resources last year, reported the lowest level of overall satisfaction with their House advising resources. Forty-four percent reported feeling either very or somewhat satisfied, and 24 percent of respondents from Dunster reported feeling dissatisfied—the highest proportion of any House.
Across Houses, student room arrangements vary dramatically. Mather House offers single bedrooms for every resident, but others are populated by cramped doubles and walkthrough suites.
Many citing dissatisfaction with on-campus housing, 21 percent of survey respondents said they would consider moving off-campus. In writing, respondents who said they would consider the move also referenced discontent with the College meal plan and an interest in moving to the Dudley Co-op, an off-campus student house where residents prepare their own food and do their own chores.
- Seventeen percent of respondents reported living in gender-neutral housing. In May 2014, the Faculty of Arts and Science approved a change to the College Student Handbook formalizing a College-wide policy allowing students to request mix-gendered suites.
- Thirteen percent of respondents reported living with no roommates, 22 percent one roommate, 14 percent two roommates, 23 percent three roommates, 13 percent four roommates, and 7 percent five roommates. Eight percent of respondents reported living with six or more roommates.
- Respondents from Houses in the Quad, which feature hallway singles in addition to traditional suites, were more likely to live with no roommates: 35 percent of Cabot respondents, 38 percent of Currier respondents, and 22 percent of Pforzheimer respondents. Twenty-two percent of Leverett House respondents also said they have no roommates.
- Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported that all of their roommates are also their blockmates.
- Fifty-four percent of respondents reported feeling very close to their blocking groups, while 28 percent reported feeling somewhat close, 11 percent reported feeling somewhat distant, and 7 percent reported feeling very distant.
- Thirty-six percent of respondents reported living in an “N+1 suite” (a room with n+1 rooms for n people), 34 percent an “N” suite, and 12 percent an “N-1 suite.” Four percent of respondents reporting living in an “N-2 suite,” 4 percent in a one-bedroom double off a hallway, and 11 percent in a one-bedroom single off a hallway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With all the resources available to Harvard students, it can be easy to forget that Harvard is not the only world-class institution in Cambridge. Just a mile down Massachusetts Avenue, or two stops down the Red Line, is MIT, home to some of the world’s most renowned faculty, cutting-edge facilities, and groundbreaking research. 
When Harvard upperclassmen query for courses, they have not only Harvard’s course catalog at their disposal but also MIT’s. However, while roughly 5,000 Harvard undergraduates are eligible—freshmen are not allowed to cross-register—College students account for only 96 seats in classes at MIT, according to data from Harvard’s Registrar’s Office. Meanwhile, 119 MIT students are taking classes at Harvard, according to MIT’s Office of the Registrar.
Though some see this as a testament to the quality of classes Harvard has to offer, others think it is a missed opportunity to take different types of courses with a different student body.
A CONTRAST TO LIBERAL ARTS
Of the 96 enrollments on the eastern end of Cambridge, 42 are in MIT’s course on Corporate and Financial Accounting. No other MIT course has more than six Harvard undergraduates taking it.
The multitude of students taking corporate and financial accounting exemplifies what some see Harvard to be lacking and MIT has to offer: practicality.
“It’s one of the more practical courses I’ve taken in college,” Ryan C. Pallas ’16 said. “I don’t think a lot of the classes I’ve taken at Harvard will help me directly with my future career and I think this one will.”
Director of undergraduate studies for Harvard’s Economics department Jeffrey A. Miron said his impression is that many Harvard students taking the accounting class to boost their transcript in order to secure a job in the finance industry.
However, Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career Services, said that employers typically do not expect Harvard students to know accounting, given that the College is a liberal arts school.
“It is not necessary for students to have accounting experience to a land junior summer finance position and most firms provide significant training for full-time hires to gain a basic foundation in financial literacy before they begin their full-time job,” she said.
Despite praising MIT’s ability to provide classes with real world applications, many taking the course believe that cross registration offers an adequate replacement to accounting classes at Harvard. Tiffany H. Song ’16, who is enrolled in Corporate and Financial Accounting, said that having an accounting class would seem contrarian to Harvard’s philosophy of providing students with a well-rounded, liberal arts education.
“I think it’s good that we don’t offer those kinds of courses,” she said. “It forces us to think outside the box.”
Still, Miron said that it would be “fruitful” for Harvard to offer a similar course in accounting.
“It’s too bad that we don’t offer more of that here because it would save the students a trek,” he said. “I suspect we could do at least as good a job. I think there’s lots of intellectually interesting and practical material that would be very helpful to students. ”
DIVERSE EXPERIENCES
Outside of Corporate and Financial Accounting, there are 19 cross enrollments across five of MIT’s engineering departments. MIT boasts an engineering program that is much larger than its counterpart at Harvard.
After talking to his advisor, Salathiel Ntakirutimana ’16, an Electrical Engineering concentrator, said he concluded that MIT’s offerings on electrical power systems were more attractive than equivalent courses at Harvard. This fall, MIT’s department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science attracted 13 cross-registrations from Harvard students, according to Registrar data.
“If you are an engineer, [you] get to see some of their labs and work with students there,” Ntakirutimana said. “It’s an amazing opportunity.”
Even though MIT is often thought of as an engineering school, some students opted to take courses there in the arts and humanities.
For Anita K. Y. Lo ’16, the selectivity of Harvard’s creative writing workshops was the chief motivating factor to cross-register. Having been rebuffed by Harvard’s workshops multiple times, Lo turned to MIT’s Advanced Fiction Workshop, which still requires instructor approval but has much more open enrollment, according to Lo.
“I had applied multiple times into Harvard’s creative writing courses and not had a lot of success there,” she said, adding that some of her friends cross-registered into nontraditional MIT classes that have no equivalents at Harvard, such as one on video game making.
MIT’s Media Arts and Sciences department, which was the third most popular department for cross-registration, hosted 10 Harvard students this past fall. Harvard does not have a comparable department, leading some students pursuing an interest in media studies to turn to MIT. Five more cross-registered into MIT’s Humanities department.
Naomi K. Lang ’16 was one such student. After Claire A. Conceison, a former visiting professor at Harvard who specializes in theater studies, moved her class from Harvard to MIT, Lang knew she wanted to follow her there. Currently, Lang is not only taking Conceison’s class, but also considering pursuing independent study with her at MIT next semester.
Maggie Welsh, Harvard’s associate registrar for enrollment services, said that cross-registration is not just about taking a new course, but also about being exposed to different students, faculty, teaching methods, and culture.
Both Lo and Lang said that taking a humanities class in what is traditionally viewed as an engineering school provided for an interesting change of pace from Harvard’s environment.
“It’s a different experience because everyone in the class was doing something like engineering or physics or stuff like that. I think maybe that contributed to a little bit of different perspectives,” Lo said.
For some, venturing into MIT also opens the door to a new social network. For instance, Lang keeps in touch with many of her classmates at MIT and has even gone to watch some of their games.
ROOM FOR GROWTH
Despite the perks cross-registration may yield, MIT cross-registration remains a resource that some say is underutilized.
“I suspect what motivates them not to do it is the travel,” Welsh said. The M2 shuttle provides free transportation to MIT’s campus and students also have the option to take the Red Line. Still, according to some, the 15-minute ride to MIT can be a major deterrent, especially in the winter.
Some students lack knowledge of the full range of transport options that are at their disposal. During the first few weeks the semester, Ntakirutimana was unaware of the free M2 shuttle and instead had to spend money on the train rides each week.
Others say there is simply a lack of awareness on campus about the opportunity to cross-register.
“From my personal experience, when I tell people I’m cross-registered, half of them either say, ‘oh I didn’t realize that was a thing,’ and the other half say, ‘are you taking the accounting class?’” said Alex S. Peed ’18, who is currently cross-registered in Corporate and Financial Accounting.
Welsh also speculates that some students only discover the resource late in their academic careers, at which point they have fewer semesters left and less time to fulfill their various academic requirements.
Though many students who have gone through the process said it was straightforward, there still can be some inconveniences.
“It’s definitely not a thing,” Lang said of the prominence of cross-registration at Harvard. “It did take some time for me to figure out what I needed to do. With this class, I needed to get the professor to sign this special form, I needed to take this form MIT myself, then I needed to bring copy to registrar and then it didn’t show up on study card until weeks later.”
To rid the process of administrative hassles, the Registrar’s Office is looking to automate the process by putting it online, according to Welsh. In doing so, undergraduates will be able directly search MIT courses through the University catalog, much like they currently can with graduate school courses. They will then be able to petition for MIT classes online, reducing the need to travel back forth for physical signatures. Welsh said the office looks to implement these changes by next semester, though it is possible it will be delayed until the fall of 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the federal government proposed the first major changes in two decades to regulations on the conduct of human experiments, Harvard will formally submit comments based on input from professors and administrators.
To protect the rights and privacy of individuals, the federal government in 1979 instituted strict regulations on the conduct of experiments involving humans as test subjects, known as the “Common Rule.” The rule states that anyone who proposes to use human subjects in any research—including human tissue or cells—must obtain prior approval from the appropriate institutional review board, a committee  designated to approve and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans.
Harvard has three such boards, for Harvard Medical School, the School of Public Health, and the Harvard schools in Allston and Cambridge.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services proposed major reforms to the Common Rule this fall. Some reforms seek to enhance protections for human subjects, such as strengthening the requirement for informed consent on the use of biospecimens, better facilitating single approval processes for researchers cooperating across universities or other institutions, and enhancing and creating detailed systems to track consent.
A number of researchers across the country criticized the proposed revisions. In response to the large volume of comments made on the proposed revisions, the Department of Health and Human Services has extended the public comment period by 30 days to Jan. 6.
Ara Tahmassian, Harvard’s chief research compliance officer, said the the proposed changes could apply the same regulations on high-risk experiments to lower-risk experiments, such as social science surveys and economics research. Tahmassian said he was uncertain about that potential change.
“I believe that there needs to be a better correlation between the research conducted today and the regulations designed for their oversight,” Tahmassian said.
Tahmassian is tasked with seeking input on the proposed policy change from Harvard affiliates, including faculty members and administrators, before submitting Harvard’s finalized comments on the changes to the regulations before the deadline in early January.
Besides Tahmassian,  many people in the wider research community have also been critical of the proposals.
Last week, the Council on Governmental Relations, an association of 190 research universities including Harvard that provides information, analysis, and advice on policy issues affecting research, penned an open letter to the Department of Health and Human Services criticizing the proposed reforms. As a member of the council’s board of directors, Pamela S. Caudill, chief research operations officer for the Medical School, signed the letter. She declined to comment, deferring to Tahmassian.
The letter criticized the revision of the regulations because of the vagueness of rules’ wording, the large costs associated with universities implementing the rules, and the lack of data and information available to indicate that a revision of the regulations would necessarily be beneficial.
“Conversely, there are major proposed revisions that would lead to a significant increase in burden, delay, ambiguity, and cost, and a loss of valuable research without increasing protections for human subjects,” the letter says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Just having that feeling of putting your country across your chest, and hearing the national anthem for the first time, and playing for something bigger than just yourself, that was huge,” Harvard men’s basketball freshman guard Corey Johnson said.
Johnson is one of a handful of Crimson athletes who represent their respective countries at the competitive international level. The Ontario native has played for Team Canada at the 2014 International Basketball Federation Americas Under-18 Championship, winning silver, and the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where his team finished fifth.
Representing the red, white, and blue on the strip, Harvard standout fencer Eli Dershwitz is taking this year off to train for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After claiming first-team All-American and All-Ivy honors last season as a freshman, the Sherborn, Mass., product became the first American fencer to win gold in men’s individual sabre at a Junior World Championship this past April.
“I’d come so close so many different times,” Dershwitz said. “It was really nice to work really hard and come up with a big win…. Those type of moments boost your confidence to the level where you think that if you train really hard, you can reach any level possible.”
Like Dershwitz, women’s soccer central defender Marie Becker won the biggest trophy of them all at the junior level, capturing the 2014 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup with the German national team. The sophomore was part of a Die Nationalelf side that went unbeaten on its way to becoming tournament champions.
“Winning a World Cup is a very surreal experience,” Becker said. “It’s not something you’d ever plan, ‘Hey, next year I’m going to win a World Cup.’ You go into the tournament, you win a game, then you win another game, and then you’re there, and you can’t really grasp it.”
Competing at the international level was, almost exclusively, a positive experience for the trio. Johnson, who received only a single Division I offer heading into his first summer with Team Canada, said he benefitted greatly from the opportunity to play with and against the top young players in the world. It even convinced him to take a post-graduate year at Vermont Academy, during which schools like Harvard and Butler invited him to join their respective programs.
“From when I was at the tournament, a lot of scouts were watching and ESPN guys on Twitter were talking about me,” Johnson said. “That got my name out there, so a lot of people started asking questions about me. My coach also helped a lot with that.”
The 6’5”, 200-pound guard also developed greatly during his two summers playing under head coach Roy Rana, breaking out of his traditional role as his team’s knockdown shooter and emerging as more of a combo guard.
“I feel like I expanded my game from being more than just a shooter,” Johnson said. “I want to be a communicator and leader on the floor…. [Playing for Canada] really excelled my game to a whole other level, understanding basketball better and learning to play off the ball.”
Becker, who started 16 games for the Crimson on her way to an All-Ivy honorable mention selection, helped Germany advance to the semifinals of the U-19 European Championships in the summer of 2013. She said she has observed tactical differences between the international and college games, nuances that have made her a more versatile and aware defender.
Primary among those differences is the focus on direct play from the back in the collegiate setting. Because teams only have three substitutions at the international level, attacking players have to conserve their energy and cannot press the center backs relentlessly. This allows teams to build out patiently from the back.
“Playing with Germany was definitely a lot, lot more possession,” Becker said. “Long balls from the back line were more rare, whereas it’s more common to do that here. At Harvard, we’re very capable of playing the possession game, but we just don’t do it that much.”
Becker said she credits her time at the international level with her personal development; she represented the German Football Association from the U-17 to U-20 levels. This experience helped make her a reliable center back for the Crimson.
“Playing among and against the best players in the world of my age group is an experience that does not leave you untouched,” Becker said. “I definitely learned a lot, to play under high pressure, at a high speed, and under very elaborate tactical conditions. I think I can contribute some of those experiences to [Harvard’s] team.”
Dershwitz, like a number of prospective Harvard Olympians before him, is taking time between his freshman and sophomore years to train full-time for the upcoming Summer Olympics, participating in qualifying tournaments along the way. He has represented Team USA at various levels since 2010, winning his first gold medal at the 2010 Cadet World Cup in Goppingen, Germany.
After 14 first place finishes across various junior tournaments, Dershwitz joined the Crimson men’s saber   team in the fall of 2014 with high expectations. Having trained with current national team coach Zoran Tulum since the age of 10, Dershwitz did not disappoint. He went 15-0 at the Ivy League Round Robins, helping Harvard capture the Ancient Eight title.
“It was really fun,” Dershwitz said of his college fencing experience. “It was different coming from a purely individual sport to being part of a larger team. It wasn’t really something I was prepared for. I was used to either winning or losing by myself.”
Following his exploits for the Crimson, Dershwitz capped off his campaign with a run of gold medals for Team USA. Apart from the aforementioned gold at the Junior World Championships, he claimed the top spot at the recent Junior World Cup. He was also part of a Team Sabre squad that won gold at the 2015 Senior Fencing World Cup in Tbilisi, Georgia.
“When I win, I get to feel great because I know that it was my hard work and my dedication,” Dershwitz said. “When I lose, it’s on me and there are things I can work on and improve. That constant process of improvement, getting success, changing things up, getting more success has really been one of the huge aspects of the sport that’s kept me going.”
Dershwitz has had a strong start to his qualifying campaign, boosted in the standings by the world championships victory last summer. He has just four tournaments remaining to book his ticket to Rio, with the home stretch beginning in Boston at the FIE Grand Prix, where he finished in the top 25.
For these athletes who have suited up for the Crimson while or after representing their countries, experience at the international level has helped make them invaluable members of their respective teams. Most of all, the opportunity to wear their flag across their chests has been one they will likely never forget.
