After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, one of my peers was brutally arrested by Cambridge police, police sworn to protect him and me alike. He, a lone individual, was surrounded by multiple officers. They threw him on the ground. They held him down as one officer punched him repeatedly. He cried out for help. They responded with even more force. This was a public assault. It occurred in response to a vulnerable individual who was in desperate need of aid. And it occurred not just despite, but in the shadow of the towering prestige of this institution.
It has been nearly a week. But when I sat down to write this column, I still hadn’t wrapped my head around it. There was nothing else I wanted to write about, but I still didn’t know what to say. Now, I am trying (and trying, and trying. This is my seventh attempt.)
While I have been left reeling in the past week, I realize my reeling is different from that of my black peers. As a non-black person of color, this incident has reminded me that I will never know the weight of black skin. It has thrown the realities of my privilege and my own understanding of anti-blackness into clear light. It’s reminded me how often non-black people of color like me perpetuate anti-blackness in our own communities and how often we actually further the oppression of black people.
It’s hard to critique your own people. But in the wake of this brutality and arrest, I see that it’s crucial to do so. I have watched non-black people of color hesitate to show solidarity with our black peers on campus. I have heard some of us refuse to condemn the officers or attempt to justify their actions. I have even heard some place blame on our fellow student.
We need to do better.
We must recognize that a centuries-old legacy of colonization and white supremacy has shaped our own minds. This legacy of white hegemony has convinced us that fair is lovely. It has convinced us that to be white is to be beautiful. It has convinced us that success and failure are a simple result of hard work or laziness, not structures of privilege and oppression. It has convinced us that to be white is to be intelligent. It has convinced us that to be white is to be better.
In this deification of white people, we have learned and internalized that we, as people of color, are less. And then, we have learned that black people are less than us. Because in order to be worthy, we must be white. And in order to be white, we must be as little black as possible. We must straighten our thick hair, bleach our skin, and dream of straight noses. We must ignore the socio-political realities of America to argue that all is equal simply because slavery no longer exists. For those of us who are Asian American, we must cling to our “model minority” label while blaming the struggles of the black community on laziness and incompetence.
This anti-blackness, present in our ignorance and our lack of support, actively harms black communities. In a society dominated by whiteness, fractures among people of color are destructive, whether they are present in denunciation of Black Lives Matter movements or in affirmative action lawsuits that perpetuate anti-blackness by pitting the success of Asian Americans against black Americans.
These crumbs of white supremacy, which drive division and promote disaffiliation among people of color, do nothing for us. These crumbs will not make us equal. They will only make our second-class status permanent.
Because we will never be white. No amount of bleach, no amount of political pandering, no amount of money, no amount of degrees—nothing will make any of us white. It does not matter how perfect my English is. It does not matter that I will one day have a Harvard diploma hanging on my wall. Hell, it wouldn’t matter if I whipped off my scarf tomorrow, denounced Islam, and dyed my hair blonde. I still wouldn’t be white. I still would be other.
The key to liberation is to recognize this reality. We must recognize that the empty rewards won for trying to be white come at the cost of our own values and our own cultures. We must recognize that progress is not in denouncing our color and the realities of it, but in denouncing the legacy of white supremacy that suppresses us. Equality will only be achieved once we honor our black peers as our equals and take on their struggles as our own.
And for those of us who have recognized this reality, we must commit to action. We cannot remain complicit in structures built upon injustice.
I know that too often the burden of colonialism and imperialism is on people of color. I know I cannot undo the fact that hundreds of years ago, a group of white men decided to destroy the land my ancestors lived on, build their own society, and repeat this around the whole world. I cannot undo the consequences of this conquest, consequences that still define us today.
But I can choose to reject colorism. I can choose to reject cultural imperialism, by studying and gaining complete fluency in my native language, by honoring my culture, by challenging the norms of Western discourse surrounding economics and politics.
And today, I can reject anti-blackness. I can choose solidarity.
In the wake of this brutality, so close to home, I choose to be an active ally for my black peers and friends. I choose to denounce violence. I choose to stand behind my black peers on this campus, offering myself in whatever way is valuable.
I hope that my fellow non-black people of color will join me. This time, let’s do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was so excited to wake up and see the headline on last Thursday’s newspaper: Next semester, juniors and underclassmen will for the first time be able to declare a secondary in Educational Studies. I’d heard rumors about a possible Education secondary that piqued my interest—I earned an associate’s degree in Education at the community college I attended before Harvard—but had no idea it would actually come to fruition in my remaining two years here. Giving students greater accessibility to formally exploring education, especially as an intersection to their respective concentrations, is a wonderful decision that will benefit many people at Harvard and beyond.
My mom has been a public elementary school teacher since before I was born, and because I grew up seeing just how much the job demanded from her, I always believed I’d never have anything to do with education. In community college, though, I heard rave reviews about an education class, and since I was undecided on my major, I took it. I enrolled in that class expecting to learn strictly teaching strategies and classroom management. To my surprise, it was centered around exploring the social and economic forces that shape the way our society interacts with and values schools and education. It made me rethink everything I knew about not only the American school system, but our society as a whole.
I learned about education inequality among races, incomes, and geographic locations. I learned about the critical role of community, school, and family support systems. I learned about the politics of education, the foundational policies, modern legislation, and ongoing issues of contention. Instead of simply learning how to teach, I learned how to better myself in order to help others learn. That was the most unexpected, yet fascinating part: I learned to identify my biases, empathize with others, acknowledge differences and establish common grounds, and build and maintain relationships with people very different from me—not just for the sake of teaching, but to be a greater positive influence on the world. I left that class with a much stronger appreciation of America’s education system, finally understanding the extent to which education intersects with all other aspects of our society.
Perhaps it was the unexpectedness of learning about schools, students, and myself as opposed to simple lesson planning, but the magic of this education class was that I began to notice and question things I’d always just passively accepted before. I started paying attention to how schools are funded and what kind of students different schools produce.
When I first came to Harvard, I was fascinated by student demographics and backgrounds. Quite a bit of what I learned in that class was applicable to daily life, too. I remember one class in which our professor explained student misbehavior as a possible manifestation of the frustrations of poverty, a difficult home life, and lack of a support system. This was a good lesson in learning about not only education but empathy, a reminder that you never know what someone else is going through.
That’s the value in exploring education through the new secondary, or even taking an education class or two. Studying education can provide you with a broader, more in-depth understanding of others, yourself, and the world around you. After all, learning is a lifelong endeavor; wouldn’t it be nice to better know who and what influences how you and others learn?
Every student at Harvard ended up here because of some kind of influence from the education system they grew up in, whether that system propelled them directly into a top university or they followed a less direct path. For students, it’s important to recognize the systems that enabled us to be here—and especially the political, social, and economic forces that drive those systems.
Educational Studies will enable us to do just that: better understand our own paths and, hopefully, better understand the forces that drive the paths of others. You might be surprised to see just how much the world of education intersects with your concentration; you might find out it intersects with fields you never would have expected. Even if you have no plans to pursue teaching or education careers, so much can be learned from this invaluable new program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Tuesday, as I waited for my second appointment with a social worker in Counseling and Mental Health Services at Harvard, I couldn’t help but laugh at how much I wanted to talk to someone. When the familiar face of the woman I’d spoken with before came out of her office to get me, I perked up. But her eyes settled on the other black girl in the waiting room as she asked that girl to come on in. I was her patient, and yet this licensed social worker at Harvard University Health Services couldn’t tell the difference between me and a girl she may have never met. It was unacceptable.
My road to Counseling and Mental Health Services, or CAMHS, had been a long one. I had needed help for a while. That much was certain.
When I did finally make an appointment for myself, on the morning of April 11, I did so because I was having a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, my heart was beating too quickly. I was pacing back and forth, telling myself out loud that I looked strange, that I was acting stupid, and that I couldn’t step foot outside looking the way I did, or feeling the way I did. Every time tears threatened to spill from my eyes, I shut them tight, telling myself that I couldn’t give in, I couldn’t be weak. Obviously, I needed help. So, I signed into my Harvard University Health Services account, and I made an appointment for the next day. It was comforting. Even if nothing else changed, at least I would be able to talk to someone.
And that’s how I got myself through April 11. Before every class, before every meeting, I took a deep breath and said: If nothing else changes, at least I’ll be able to talk to someone. If nothing else changes, at least one person on this campus will understand how I feel. The day went by, and although I still had trouble breathing, although my heart was still beating too quickly, although I still couldn’t quite feel happy with who I was, I made it through.
The next day rolled around, and eventually, so did my appointment in CAMHS. There were so many things that I had been carrying around with me that I hadn’t told anyone about. I had suffered from severe depression and anxiety for four years. I had hurt myself before and I was ashamed of it. This past year, a very close family member was diagnosed with breast cancer, and I hadn’t even told my closest friends at Harvard about the diagnosis. I didn’t want them to pity me. For whatever reason, despite my accomplishments and my successes, I could not feel proud of myself. I didn’t like myself at all. I walked into my CAMHS appointment with all of that resting on my shoulders.
I told all of this to the licensed social worker that I spoke with. She asked a lot of questions, she gave me a lot of compliments, she said she never would’ve guessed that I had depression. She tried her best to offer me advice, but my issues were too complex to be solved in one meeting. Still, when I left, I felt better. I had talked about myself freely, without fear of being judged.
Heading into the weekend of Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring concert, there was a lot to look forward to. I still felt anxious, but I was excited too. Yardfest came and I danced and sang and partied with my friends, just as much of campus was doing. And then the next morning, April 14, I woke up to the news that a black undergraduate had been beaten by an officer in the Cambridge Police Department after a call from HUHS ultimately ended up routed to CPD.
I felt defeated. I am black. I have a mental illness. What I want, more than anything, is to know that this campus and its health institutions are dedicated to my health and my safety. But how can that be the case when HUHS decides to call the police on a black student rather than offering him the medical support to which he is entitled? How can that be the case when the color of one’s skin seemingly invalidates the legitimacy of one’s illness? I  cannot speak to the details of what happened between CPD officers and the student who suffered at their hands. I can speak to what the encounter reveals about our health services system.
On Tuesday, April 17, I met with the same licensed social worker for a follow up. I knocked on the door to her office. She opened it, and asked me to wait in the waiting room for just a moment. So, I walked into the waiting room, and took a seat near a young black woman. The social worker came out, and looked at that black woman sitting in front of me. “I’m ready for you now,” she said. The social worker, who had spent an hour talking to me just days before, and who had looked me in the eyes just moments ago, was now addressing another black girl, thinking she was me. After an awkward silence, the social worker looked around, saw me, smiled, and ushered me into her office without a word of apology.
If a woman to whom I told my most private thoughts, whom I cried in front of, cannot identify me when I’m sitting right in front of her, I don’t know how to expect her to actually be equipped to support me. If the mental health care providers at Harvard University cannot distinguish one black girl from the next, can’t even be bothered to remember who we are from one moment to another, I don’t know how to expect them to care enough to offer us help instead of taking us into custody.
Health care requires empathy and understanding. Racism and bias undermine empathy and understanding, and they keep black students from receiving effective care. They deprive us of what we are entitled to as students. There is a lack of empathy and understanding at HUHS. It has everything to do with racism. It has everything to do with the police incident that occurred on Friday night.
I still need help. But sadly, I do not trust HUHS to offer me that help. I do not know what I am going to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Dean of the Graduate School of Education James E. Ryan announced that students from the College will now be able to graduate with a secondary field in Educational Studies. Students will be afforded the opportunity to count courses from both the Graduate School of Education and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences towards this degree, representing a one-of-a-kind collaboration between the College and one of Harvard’s graduate schools. We strongly commend this innovative and much-needed new secondary and the many students and faculty members who advocated for it.
Contributing to the field of education is one of the most fundamental ways to effect change. Ensuring that every child has access to a quality education is one of the most potent ways to promote social mobility and combat historical injustices. We believe that this new secondary concentration perfectly aligns with the mission of Harvard College: to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society. Allowing undergraduates to formally study education empowers students to further this mission beyond Harvard’s campus.
We believe that the College should do more to create spaces for students interested in education. Currently, many students take circuitous routes into the field, often either declaring Social Studies with a focus field relating to education or taking up a related social science field such as Psychology, African American Studies, or Sociology. Additionally, many students pursue education through their extracurricular commitments, tutoring students in the Greater Boston area. The Educational Studies secondary will allow these students to bring their passion into the classroom while also creating a formal community of individuals who share that passion.
Furthermore, this move by Harvard legitimizes education as a complex and theoretical discipline that is able to fit into the College’s liberal arts mission. We appreciate the College’s effort to view education through this lens rather than from a pre-professional one. Subtopics within education are many and varied, ranging from matters of public policy to ethical deliberations. Given this, we would hope that the College would not allow courses from the Graduate School of Education that are explicitly pre-professional to count towards the secondary, and that instead, the focus of the secondary will be on expanding the course offerings at the College that touch on education. Not only will this enrich the diverse of classes offered for the student body, but it will also decrease undergraduates’ reliance on the Graduate School of Education by providing an infrastructure at the College for students pursuing an Educational Studies secondary.
We applaud the student and faculty activists who have worked for decades towards this development. Katherine K. Merseth, a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Education, whose popular General Education course United States in the World 35: "Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education" is one of the few education-related courses offered at the College, played a significant role in this effort, as did the Undergraduate Council and many other students. We are glad that they have persevered, and so too will be future generations of Harvard students. Furthermore, we hope this will set a precedent for the creation of other fields of study that have long been advocated for by the student body. Students are hungry to learn about learning, and we are grateful that their interest has finally been met.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an unprecedented breakthrough, Harvard researchers have combined two atoms for the first time to form a single dipolar molecule with unique properties, according to an article published in Science magazine last Thursday.
Assistant Chemistry and Chemical Biology Professor Kang-Kuen Ni and several other members of the Ni Lab—including researchers Jonathan D. Hood, Lee R. Liu, Yichao Yu, Jessie T. Zhang, Till Rosenband, and Nicholas R. Hutzler—made the discovery.
The scientists specifically examined the dipolar molecule formed by combining an atom of sodium and an atom of cesium.
“What we did is we trapped two atoms in individual optical tweezers—which is just what you get when you focus a laser—and then we were able to move those tweezers and overlap the atoms independently and put them into the same tweezer,” Liu said. “We added a photon, and then that triggered a reaction between these two atoms.”
“What we achieved is the minimum number of ingredients for a reaction: two atoms plus something to add or remove energy. In this case, we added energy,” he added.
Ni explained that the ability to precisely combine two individual atoms with optical tweezers avoids the uncertainty inherent to conventional methods of performing chemical reactions, in which many different atoms are mixed together. This traditional approach often produces other compounds rather than the desired one, according to Liu,
“In usual experiments… you start with a bunch of A, you start with a bunch of B, they’ll find each other and yield some product that’s AB,” Ni said. “But what we have done differently is that we have a lot more control. So we grab exactly one A, grab exactly one B, and then allow them to react in a very controlled way.”
Liu emphasized that the key to the team’s recent breakthrough was not necessarily inventing new techniques, but creatively combining a variety of existing technologies in a unique way.
“All the individual techniques have existed in some form or another. For example, the main things here are laser cooling, getting atoms down to very close to absolute zero—that has existed for many, many years, decades even,” Liu said. “This is the first time they’ve been brought together for two different species—that’s the important thing—and brought together to make this chemical reaction. It’s kind of the combination of everything that’s new here.”
The particular sodium-cesium molecule the researchers developed is particularly important as a building block for quantum computers, or qubits, according to Liu. Due to its asymmetric nature, the molecule acts almost like a bar magnet, a property that is desired in qubits.
“From the physics perspective, the sodium and cesium molecule can do a lot for us. The reason why we chose it is because this bar magnet property that it has is maximally strong for this particular combination,” Liu said.
Ni said that her group’s ultimate goal is to make these new dipolar molecules stable and long-lasting, which will increase the attractions and repulsions between the two atoms, making them behave even more like a bar magnet, and improve their potential for quantum computing.
“The molecules that we made directly right now are in an electronic excited state. So they don’t live for very long, and we don’t hold on to them soon after they’re made,” she said. “Our next step is to combine other techniques so that we can make these molecules in a stable ground state.”

Even though the Allston School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus will not open until the fall of 2020, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said he is already excited about “the new future of Harvard.”
In a March interview, Doyle discussed construction on the school's new facilities, challenges associated with transitioning SEAS faculty across the river, and University relations with Allston residents.
Doyle said the flagship Science and Engineering Complex held its “topping off” ceremony in November 2017, marking the completion of the 500,000 square foot building’s superstructure and a transition to interior construction.
“The final steel beam is in place, so the superstructure is constructed,” he said. “If you drive by it now, you'll see it's kind of shrouded because we're doing the interior construction.”
Doyle said environmental concerns were a priority in the building’s construction, which prompted the decision to use “winglets” on the exterior that deflect sunlight in the summer and refract it inside for heating in the winter.
“The idea is to be as environmentally friendly as we can, to do things with the building design that’s smart, that makes it energy efficient, but that's also going to give it a very different look than a traditional Harvard red brick gothic building,” he said.
Doyle also said the SEAS faculty, roughly two-thirds of which will be relocating to the new campus, has already begun preparing for the move.
“Rolling out a new class schedule, thinking about the new timing, that's one way the faculty are mentally wrapping their arms around this,” Doyle said.
Doyle also said he has started “lunchtime conversations” with SEAS faculty to discuss the collaborative possibilities the Allston campus will offer. For the first time, faculty from most of the SEAS disciplines—including bioengineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering—will be housed in the same building.
“We've never had that here,” Doyle said. “We're literally an archipelago today. There for the first time, slightly more than half my faculty will have a common roof, a common break space, food space, library, labs. Just the combinations, the serendipitous collisions that are going to happen intellectually as well as socially are going to be really exciting.”
Doyle also said he detected “enthusiasm” from Allston residents, whose sometimes strained relations with the University have drawn intense scrutiny in recent years as Harvard expands into the neighborhood.
“Our project had been stalled for a while, after the economic downturn, and now that things are picking back up again, I think there's excitement that we really are going to deliver Harvard on the kind of presence that we want to bring to Allston with very careful consideration for the wishes of the community,” he said.
Plans for the SEAS campus were repeatedly delayed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
Doyle said he hopes the Allston campus will become a “destination that people are excited to be going to.”
“In little ways we're beginning to see that that's beginning to happen,” he said. “There are these other installations that aren't academic in nature that help create that sense of there's a community, there's something happening there, that people aren't just going to hike across the bridge, take a class, and hike back to the Yard, but in fact there'll really be a reason to stick around and hang out.”

BubbleBox, a portable hygiene module created by a team that includes Harvard students, won first place at Talents #Paris2024 earlier this year.
The project aims to provide migrants, refugees, and homeless persons with free showers and washing machines. BubbleBox uses solar power to recycle about 90 percent of the water used while showering.
Talents #Paris2024 is a competition meant to encourage innovation among Parisians aged 16 to 24. The top prize included a €25,000 grand prize. Arkam M. Javed ’20, one of the members of the team, said the group plans to invest the money in research and development in hopes of creating a prototype.
The project's inception came during The Biopolis, a summer school program in Paris that focuses on biology, urbanism, and social innovation. The program is a collaboration between Harvard, the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity, SciencesPo, and the City of Paris.
At The Biopolis, Christina M. Bear ’20 and Javed joined forces with two Sciences Po students. The team spent the summer conducting research before presenting their idea to the Paris City Council.  Benjamin H. Lee ’19 joined the group in the fall.
Javed said the team became inspired to create the Bubble Box after visiting a refugee camp. At the camp, the group saw the extent to which the residents of the camp lacked access to resources needed to maintain proper hygiene. Further research revealed that, on average in these types of camps, only one sink is available to 700 people, and that in some places refugees face scabies outbreaks.
“Seeing refugees living in such horrid conditions in a developed country like France shocked us and so when it came time for our team to design a project in line with one or more of the UN sustainable development goals, we were certain we wanted to do something for refugees,” Javed said.
Robert A. Lue, professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard and co-founder of The Biopolis, declared himself a fan of the module. He wrote in an email that BubbleBox is a perfect example of the kind of work the program wanted students to produce.
“It was one of my favorite projects from this summer; creative and beautifully tailored to the needs of an underserved population in a mobile way that meets them where they are, literally," Lue wrote. "The additional aspects related to water and energy conservation make it even more compelling and aligned with the goals of sustainable living."
Looking forward, Javed said the goal is to conduct a test run in France.
“Our goal is to launch our modules in Northern Paris and then expand from there. Hopefully we can make Bubblebox a reality,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith awarded four professors prestigious Arts and Sciences Professorships earlier this month.
Catherine Dulac, professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, was named the Lee and Ezpeleta Professor of Arts and Sciences. Jennifer Lewis, professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering, was named Jianming Yu Professor of Arts and Sciences. Louis Menand, professor of English, was named the Lee Simpkins Family Professor of Arts and Sciences. Mary C. Waters, professor of Sociology, was named the PK Professor of Arts and Sciences.
Smith established these professorships in 2012 to honor tenured faculty members for “excellence in leadership, teaching, and scholarly achievement.” Selected professors are appointed for a five-year term and are granted additional funding towards research and other work-related costs.
Dulac, who has worked at Harvard for the past 21 years, investigates how neural circuits control what she calls the “secrets of behavior.” In particular, she focuses on instinctive social behaviors like mating, aggression, and parenting.
She is also involved in the National Institute of Health’s Brain Research through Advancing Neurotechnologies Initiative, which works towards identifying all the neuronal types across the brain.
Dulac says she plans to use the funds that come with her professorship to create research fellowships that will support undergraduate students. She said she believes some of the best teaching happens in the lab.
“It's extremely rewarding as a teacher because you can see how much they learn, not only of the science, but actually also on how research functions, and some of them ‘catch the virus,’” Dulac said.
Waters said she hopes to utilize the funds from her professorship to conduct research in the field. Her current project, called “Resilience in Survivors of Katrina,” is a longitudinal study that traces the lives of over 1,000 African-American single mothers before and after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. She is also working on a book on mass incarceration and immigration detention.
Waters has worked in the sociology department since she first earned her Ph.D. in 1986.
She said she finds continued joy in working with her students and colleagues.
“It's probably the best job you could ever imagine, because you get to study whatever you want and teach really brilliant students, and so what's not to like?" she said.
Education has also formed a priority for Menand.
“The main attraction for me at Harvard is working on making the institution better,” Menand said.
Four years ago, Menand worked with colleagues to develop Humanities 10: "From Homer to Garcia Marquez”—an intensive introduction to literature course for first-year students.
Beyond teaching the popular English 170a: “High and Low in Postwar America” course, Menand also sits on the Faculty of Education and cited his work with institutional development as one of his most rewarding projects  at Harvard. When he first arrived at Harvard in 2003, he was appointed to the committee that established the General Education Program.
Menand won the Pulitzer Prize and Francis Parkman Prize for his book The Metaphysical Club in 2002. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded him the National Humanities Medal, acknowledging his role in expanding the nation’s cultural understanding and engagement.
Lewis, who holds numerous patents, works on the assembly of soft functional materials. Her lab recently developed new technologies that speed up the process of 3D printing. Her professorship funds will go towards “designing organ-specific tissues for drug screening, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine, while giving her students hands-on experience,” according to a press release.
Lewis serves as a "Core Faculty Member" at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, and was elected last year to the National Academy of Engineering.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four College juniors woke up to an email Tuesday morning informing them of their selection as inductees into the Alpha Iota chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the country’s oldest honor society.
The society selects new members three times each year—24 juniors in the spring, 48 seniors in November, and around 96 seniors prior to graduation. The selection process is particularly rigorous for the first 24 inductees; after being notified they are up for consideration, they can accept the nomination by submitting their academic record and two letters of recommendation.
The Phi Beta Kappa website states inductees are chosen on the basis of “a record of outstanding scholarly achievement, showing both depth of study and breadth of intellectual interest.”
Several inductees said Tuesday morning began like any other: They woke up and checked their email, only to see a subject line congratulating them for their selection.
“Yesterday morning, like every other morning, I woke up around 9:30 a.m. and lay in bed while checking my phone's notifications,” Junior 24 member Lita D. Peña ’19 wrote in an email. “To be honest, I was speechless. It reminded me of how I felt when I received my Harvard acceptance email senior year of high school!”
Many inductees added that they immediately texted or called family members and close friends. History and Literature concentrator Julia H. Fine ’19 said she reached out to her mom immediately after reading the email.
“She said her mother—my grandmother—who passed away would be very proud,” Fine said.
History and Philosophy joint concentrator Richard Yarrow ’19 and Government concentrator Max Kuhelj Bugaric ’19 were suitemates their freshman and sophomore years. Yarrow said hearing about Kuhelj Bugaric’s selection was the best part of the news.
“What I was most excited by was finding out that my longtime suitemate, Max, also got PBK—after very carefully approaching the topic with each other,” he said.
Many of the inductees have pursued a wide variety of academic work at the College, including joint concentrations, secondary fields, and language citations, all optional requirements for Harvard undergraduates. Eunice Lee ’19, who is currently pursuing a joint concentration in Physics and Music, said she solicited recommendations from both departments.
“After reading the email, I felt an immense gratitude towards my recommenders,” Lee said. “I felt that I was fortunate to have two people in mind coming from two different subjects I’m interested in—so, I had in mind a professor I work with closely on composition and a professor with whom I work closely on physics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 urged administrators to consider student opinion as the College implements its penalties on members of single-gender social groups in an interview Sunday.
In Dec. 2017, after over a year of debate about the proposed penalties—which prevent members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, athletic team captancies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain fellowships—the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted to formally adopt the policy.
In the interview, Zhang and Boucher said they remained concerned with what they called a lack of student involvement in the ongoing implementation process. The College released a final implementation plan for the policy in early March.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alex R. Miller wrote in an emailed statement that the College has met with students throughout the implementation process and will continue to do so as it the implementation plan is finalized.
“Throughout the course of the process of drafting the implementation policy, we have had numerous meetings in which the UC and other student representatives were engaged, and since then the policy has been voted on and will be placed into the student handbook,” Miller wrote. “Student feedback is always a priority and we will continue to work closely with our students with the goal of making the framework operational in the fall.”
The Corporation also voted in December to mandate a review of the penalties roughly five years after their implementation.  In addition to that review, the Committee on Student Life—comprising students and faculty—will be tasked with making “periodic, interim reports” to Faculty members and administrators, according to a letter sent by University President Drew G. Faust and Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee announcing the Corporation’s decision.
As president and vice president of the Council, Zhang and Boucher serve as co-chairs of that committee, along with Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
But, according to Zhang, the duo hoped to have more involvement in hashing out the final details of the policy’s implementation.
“We had been told we would have a seat at the table, but right now, we haven’t been shown much besides our involvement with the Committee on Student Life,” Zhang said.
“Because right now, where the directive is coming from, is from people in the [Office of Student Life], from administrators in the OSL,” she added.  “Students’ rallying cry is getting more student representation and more student voice in the room.”
Boucher said he and Zhang have sought to gather a “broad set of perspectives” from students to bring to administrators.
“I’m not saying there is a disconnect right now,” Boucher said.  “But we want to make sure that there is not a disconnect between the people that the policy is going to affect—the people that are tangibly affected by it—and the people writing it.”
Boucher reiterated the position on social group penalties he and Zhang put forward during their campaign for UC leadership last fall.  The Zhang and Boucher ticket was the only one—out of three—that broadly supported the College’s efforts to regulate single-gender social groups.
During the campaign, though, the pair said they did not support the penalties as outlined by administrators at the time.  On Sunday, Zhang and Boucher said they still have similar reservations about the policy, specifically its potential effects on female groups.  In its final implementation plan, the College announced it had canceled a proposed “bridge” program that would have allowed all-female final clubs and sororities a longer period of time to go gender-neutral.
“I think one problem that we talked about specifically was how this could affect women’s groups on campus,” Boucher said.  “And that’s not to say that women’s groups can or should or need to be treated any differently.  But it is recognizing that there is value to places that are safe spaces for individuals identifying as women.”
“And I think that was one concern that we had that perhaps is addressed in some ways, but isn’t necessarily fully addressed,” Boucher added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Class Action, a national non-profit focused on educating people about classism, hosted a workshop for undergraduates Wednesday evening upon invitation from students.
The workshop highlighted how socioeconomic class affects students, both here at Harvard and more broadly.
Ben I. Sorkin ’20 organized the event, which was co-sponsored by the Harvard Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, the Undergraduate Council, the Harvard First Generation Student Union, the Phillips Brooks House Association, and Fuerza Latina.
Sorkin said he wanted to hold this event to increase awareness of class issues and class dialogue on campus, and reached out to Class Action to make it happen.
Dee Moore, an associate at Class Action, and Shane Lloyd, a senior trainer at Class Action and the Assistant Director of the Afro-American Cultural Center at Yale University, led the discussion.
Moore said Class Action focuses on building awareness around classism in the U.S. through workshops with students, nonprofits, and companies, speaking to everyone from kindergarteners to corporate executives.
“Class can be a really murky construct, because we can be talking about so many different things, but still talking past each other,” Lloyd said at the start of the workshop. 
Sorkin said the UC supported the event through an Open Harvard College Grant, UC money set aside to fund innovative events around key issues including “financial accessibility.”
Workshop participants read quotations from various slides, all of which commented on class in different ways, illustrating that class does not necessarily have a common identity.
Part of the presentation featured past and current examples of class-related issues at Harvard, including social organizations and final clubs, class divides at the Harvard Business School, and last year’s Harvard University Dining Services worker strike.
Sorkin said he thinks the workshop came to Harvard at a “critical time.”
“I think we’re reaching a tipping point where issues of class and socioeconomic difference can’t go under the radar anymore,” he said. “Students are speaking up and these issues are playing themselves out publicly. Hopefully by providing an educational workshop, students and student leaders can really address these issues among their peers and in their student groups.”
Beyond the workshop, Sorkin said he hopes administrators will receive training and student groups will continue discussions in order to broaden understandings the difficulties some students might face.
“I’m hoping that either the UC adopts a class awareness training for student leaders or the administration institutes regular workshops, so that people are sensitive to these issues—not just students who are affected by them but also people in positions of power,” Sorkin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mulling the pros and cons of installing a union at Harvard, eligible graduate and undergraduate students headed to the polls Wednesday on the first day of the University's second go at a unionization election.
The vote—set to end Thursday—will determine whether eligible students will establish a collective bargaining unit within the University. This election is Harvard’s second vote on the issue; the University also held an election in Nov. 2016. The results of that election saw a final tally of 1,526 votes cast against against unionization and 1,396 cast in favor.
In both elections, NLRB officials asked students to present identification once they entered polling stations. Officials then checked students' names against voter lists for each location.
If a voters’ name is absent from the list or otherwise inaccurate, the NLRB typically places that voter’s ballot under challenge. In that circumstance, the challenged ballot will be sealed and counted only after the voter’s eligibility is resolved.
During the first Nov. 2016 unionization election, around 1,000 ballots remained under challenge immediately after voting ended, in part due to discrepancies in the University-generated voter list. The validity of some of those ballots remained in question for over a year after polls closed as the University and the union deliberated in post-election hearings before the NLRB.
After three rulings by the regional and national chapters of the board and two separate appeals, the Board ultimately invalidated the first election’s result on the grounds that the voter list did not meet the agency’s requirements, thus mandating a second vote.
On Wednesday, voters lined up to cast their ballots at two locations: the Queen’s Head Pub in Cambridge and the Dental Research & Education Building at Harvard’s Longwood campus. Both polling sites will re-open Thursday. Some voters will also cast ballots at an additional Business School site slated to open Thursday morning.
During the last election, voting in Cambridge was held at Phillips Brooks House, leading some voters to complain of long lines. On Wednesday, the line at the Queen’s Head appeared to move at a steady clip throughout the day. Lines at the Longwood location remained minimal for much of the day.
Clad in attire ranging from sweatshirts to scrubs, many students said they  took time off from a busy day of lab work and teaching to come out to vote. Some students approached the polling places with colleagues and pondered departmental goings-on while waiting in line.
Later in the day, the conversational topic of choice shifted—those waiting in line discussed going out for drinks after voting. Some noted ruefully that the Queen’s Head will be closed for business during the hours of the election.
Recent emails sent to eligible students from both HSGU-UAW and University officials also comprised a recurring topic of conversation among students milling around the polling sites. Ph.D. student Richard A. Childers said he thought the emails were unlikely to sway many voters, but also that he thought the missives came more frequently this time around than in the run-up to the first election.
“I think it kind of depends on how strongly people are in one camp or the other to begin with,” he said. “For those that are kind of in the middle... it is going to be kind of an open question until the union goes ahead and establishes itself or doesn’t.”
M. Asad Liaqat, who said he voted for unionization in this election and in the last election, said he hopes a union will give students more of a “voice in decision making.”
“A lot of the time, the power balance is against students,” Liaqat said. “So I felt, during my four years here, that we were often not in a position to state our concerns openly and having a union would enable us to do that.”
Medical school student John L. Pulice said that, though he supports labor unions and has been a member of a union before, he cast his ballot against unionization because he does not trust the way HGSU-UAW “has been represented and has conducted itself.”
“I have not been satisfied by the explanations provided by the union in terms of the actual concrete benefits they’d provide,” Pulice said. “I think it would actually deprive students of a lot of ways to communicate with the University and have the freedom to represent ourselves based on the different divisions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 21, 2018 at 7:10 p.m.
Several freshmen and proctors said they feel uncertain for the future at a meeting with administrators Wednesday night meant to address Cambridge Police Department officers’ Friday arrest of a black College student that some have called an instance of police brutality.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 emailed freshmen Tuesday to alert them to the meeting, which took place in the common room of Straus, one of Harvard’s freshman dormitories. In addition to Dingman, Ivy Yard Dean Michael C. Ranen and Elm Yard Dean Jasmine M. Waddell also attended the discussion.
At the event, students said they feel frustrated in the wake of the arrest. Attendees particularly questioned why CPD made the arrest—Harvard University Health Services was first contacted on Friday, but HUHS transferred the call to the Harvard University Police Department. HUPD then transferred the call to CPD, according to protocol.
Before his arrest Friday, the student was standing on a median in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue. Though feet from Harvard Law School, the student was off-campus and was thus outside HUPD’s jurisdiction, which strictly comprises campus ground.
“It's clear that if people were following protocols, the protocols themselves aren't working,” Dingman said at the meeting. “Anytime somebody reaches out seeking help for a friend, which is what we hope all of you would do, it should not result in somebody being beaten.”
The student was arrested Friday after he and four members of local law enforcement—including three CPD officers and one Transit Police Department officer—engaged in a physical confrontation. The officers tackled the undergraduate, who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics, to the ground.
A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and made aggressive moves toward the officers, spurring them to tackle the undergraduate. But eyewitnesses of the incident—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated that CPD’s version of events is incorrect and that the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times shows the student standing still surrounded by four officers while the officers talk to him for at least several seconds. The student takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Then another officer tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an attempt to handcuff him, according to the CPD police report. The student was ultimately charged on several counts including assault, resisting arrest, and indecent exposure.
BLSA has called the incident an instance of police brutality. The arrest has roiled campus and drawn national headlines.
On Wednesday evening, some students said they feel frustrated with Harvard’s administration. The students asked for clarification of the amnesty policy—a policy that prevents intoxicated or otherwise impaired students from incurring disciplinary charges from Harvard if a friend delivers that student to HUHS or HUPD.
Attendees also asked for further clarity on jurisdiction boundaries between CPD and HUPD. Ruva Chigwedere ’21 said she attended the meeting to reemphasize students’ concerns to administrators.
“I really wanted to impose the fact that we want action and to lay out specific things that they could do to make the situation better and specific frustrations, and I knew that I wasn't the first voice they were hearing but I just wanted to be there to reinforce it again,” Chigwedere said.
Proctors—residential advisors for freshmen—echoed and supported students in their frustration at the discussion.
“You are not alone in your frustration,” specialty proctor for race relations Monica Tibbits-Nutt said. “This is not one lightning rod incident.”
Earlier in the day Wednesday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent an email to students calling the incident a “disturbing arrest.” University President Drew G. Faust and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern have also publicly called the arrest “disturbing.”
Khurana wrote in his email that the College can only share a “limited” amount of information in order to protect the student’s privacy.
Proctors said they feel uncertain regarding what to tell freshmen going forward. Abishek Raman, a proctor in Holworthy East, said he feels especially anxious about the approach of Primal Scream, a semesterly tradition in which students run around the Yard naked and often intoxicated the night before the first day of final exams.
Raman noted past Primal Scream participants have run on Massachusetts Avenue, the site of the physical confrontation between the student and the police Friday.
Tibbits-Nutt said that—in the wake of the arrest—she is unsure what to tell next year’s crop of freshmen about HUPD.
“I can't go into the fall with my new entryway freshmen coming in, and say, ‘Yes, call HUPD,’ because the thing is for me, especially as a person of color, my thing is—you call me, especially when dealing with the Cambridge police,” Tibbits-Nutt said.
In an interview after the event, Chigwedere echoed Tibbits-Nutt’s words, especially citing the upcoming Visitas weekend, during which prospective members of the Class of 2022 will visit Harvard. Chigwedere said she thinks the College can and should serve as a home for many people, but that she does not want to give prospective students “false hope.”
“I don't know what I am going to do, because I am hosting a minority student, but I definitely cannot impress on them that they are completely safe because, as the incident Friday night told me, it jarred me because I realized I had been assuming that I was safe and that all of the institutions were there to protect me,” Chigwedere said. “That was false.”
“I would implore the University administration to take action and to listen because the students are not going to stop and we cannot stop for the sake of our safety and our comfort on this University's campus,” Chigwedere added. “We cannot stop.”

CORRECTION: April 21, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled the name of Ruva Chigwedere '21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice—a civil rights advocacy group—sent a letter to Cambridge officials Thursday stating the recent arrest of a black Harvard student comprised  “police brutality” and calling for “systemic change.”
Cambridge Police Department officers arrested the black undergraduate Friday night after a physical confrontation. The letter—addressed to Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and CPD Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr.—states that medical or mental health personnel should have responded instead of the police.
The undergraduate arrested Friday was likely under the influence of narcotics when bystanders called Harvard University Health Services. HUHS then transferred the call to Harvard University Police Department, HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry said in an interview Monday.
According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, HUPD then transferred the call to CPD, which he described as the “department with primary jurisdiction.” The student, while standing feet from Harvard Law School, was not on campus.
“There is no place for excessive force in police interactions with civilians, particularly with unarmed youth of color,” the letter reads.
The lawyers' committee is not the first group to criticize CPD’s use of force; the Harvard Black Law Students Association tweeted out a statement Friday calling the arrest an instance of police brutality.
Before the student’s arrest, the undergraduate and four members of local law enforcement engaged in a physical confrontation. The officers tackled the student, who was naked, to the ground.
A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and began making aggressive moves toward the officers, prompting them to tackle him. But eyewitnesses of the incident—including BLSA members—have stated that CPD’s version of events is incorrect and that the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times shows the student standing still surrounded by four officers while the officers talk to him briefly. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an "ineffective" attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report. The student was arrested on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault.
The letter—penned by Executive Director Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal—calls for action from Bard and McGovern in the wake of the incident. McGovern wrote in a statement Sunday that the arrest was “disturbing.” On Monday, Bard said at a press conference that he stands by the actions of the officers who arrested the student and that CPD has not placed them on administrative leave.
In the letter, Espinoza-Madrigal wrote that Cambridge officials should “take concrete steps to properly address medical and/or mental health emergencies” and to train “police officers on implicit bias and use of force.”
The student involved in the incident is currently undergoing evaluation at a hospital for issues including mental health concerns—and the ongoing evaluation is “one of the reasons” the student has yet to be arraigned, Bard said at the Monday press conference. Bard did not directly answer a question asking whether charges against the student could be dropped in light of the undergraduate’s mental health.
The lawyers' committee's goal is for Cambridge and Harvard to “adopt a comprehensive policy” to respond to “medical and/or mental health emergencies,” per the Thursday letter.
“This policy should be aimed at ensuring that when such emergencies arise, it is medical and/or mental health professionals–those trained in handling these situations safely and effectively–who are called to the scene as first responders instead of armed police,” the letter reads.
Espinoza-Madrigal said in a phone interview Wednesday that the committee plans to “follow up” with Cambridge and Harvard officials after sending the letter.
“We have not talked with HUPD, HUHS, and CPD but we intend to now that we have drafted the letter,” he said. “We intend to follow up and continue monitoring developments in this matter and seeking meetings with the appropriate officials to discuss a comprehensive policy that can be adopted both at the city level, at the police department level to make sure that medical and mental health emergencies are properly handled.”
Espinoza-Madrigal said he does not currently know exactly which officials his group will contact, but that he plans to determine this fact in the coming weeks.
He emphasized both in the letter and in the interview that “this issue echoes many other problematic police-civilian interactions around the country involving black men.”
In particular, he pointed to the case of Terrence Coleman, a 31-year-old black man who officers from the Boston Police Department shot and killed in Oct. 2016 after responding to a 911 call reporting that Coleman needed to go to the hospital. The lawyers' committee—which represents Coleman’s mother, Hope Coleman—has argued in legal filings that, because Coleman had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, the situation was primarily a medical one and BPD should not have responded to the 911 call.
“We see strong parallels where an incident involving someone who was experiencing a medical or mental health emergency escalates into brutality perpetrated by the police,” Espinoza-Madrigal said in the Thursday interview.
Professors Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Dehlia Umunna, who serve as faculty director and deputy director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute, respectively, will represent the College student in court, according to a press release Sullivan and Umunna published Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday’s arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate does not mark the first time local authorities physically confronted and arrested a naked College student under the influence of drugs.
In 2006, police were called to deal with a non-black undergraduate—who has identified himself as Asian on social media—who was running through the hallways of Quincy House naked while under the influence of LSD. Harvard police arrived on the scene and sought to arrest the student; the undergraduate proved resistant and struck two Harvard University Police Department officers, one in the head and one in the face.
A 2006 Crimson article describing the incident notes Harvard police eventually managed to handcuff the student, who was later freed of all criminal charges. The article makes no mention of the officers violently engaging the student in any way.
This past weekend, the Cambridge Police Department responded to reports of a student in a similar situation. CPD officers arrived at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street—an off-campus location—and physically confronted a black student, who was also nude and likely under the influence of narcotics.
Video evidence published by the New York Times shows that four officers approached and surrounded the student. The undergraduate at one point took two steps towards an officer—and then at least one step back—but never touched any member of law enforcement. Shortly after the student stepped forward, one CPD officer standing behind the undergraduate tackled the student to the ground. While on the ground, one officer punched the student in the stomach at least five times in an “ineffective” attempt to handcuff the undergraduate, according to a CPD police report.
The black student has been charged on multiple counts including assault, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest. He is currently undergoing medical evaluation in part for mental health concerns; one city official—partly citing the ongoing mental health evaluation—has said CPD may drop the charges against the student.
The two incidents—which involved two different police departments—unfolded in starkly different fashions. In the wake of the black student’s arrest Friday, some have called the incident an instance of police brutality, questioning why CPD officers saw fit to tackle the student.
The ensuing controversy has roiled campus, drawn condemnation of CPD from University President Drew G. Faust and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, and generated national headlines. Both Faust and McGovern called the arrest “disturbing.”
The 2006 arrest—so similar in setup—invites comparison to the 2018 arrest.
In the 2006 case, the student—busy with schoolwork and friends—had not slept for 30 hours leading up to the incident, he told The Crimson at the time. He decided to “drop acid” for the first time shortly after this sleepless period, which turned out to be “too much to handle,” he said then.
HUPD officers reported to Quincy C entryway on Feb. 24, 2006 around 6:15 p.m. in response to calls alleging the student was running in and out of rooms in the House and making a disturbance while naked, according to the 2006 Crimson article. The student was allegedly knocking over objects and jumping on furniture, scaring residents.
HUPD officers ordered the student to stop his behavior, but the student did not comply. Instead, he tried to evade the officers, shouting while doing so. Police tried to grab the student, but he was soaking wet—he later said he had just finished showering—and managed to slip from the officers’ grasps.
In the ensuing struggle, the undergraduate hit one HUPD officer in the nose and another on the left side of the head before the police could handcuff him.
But the Crimson article does not state police involved took extreme physical action against the student. An eyewitness, then-Quincy resident tutor John C. McMillian, said at the time he did not think the student was acting belligerently and that the student did not seem to be behaving in an “intentionally aggressive” manner.
“He was excitedly trying to avoid capture, but he didn’t strike me as being intentionally aggressive,” McMillian told The Crimson in 2006. "No punches were thrown."
Following the student’s arrest, officers conveyed the undergraduate to Cambridge Hospital, according to the Crimson article.
The 2018 incident proceeded differently.
Harvard University Health Services received a call about a naked male late on Friday, April 13; the day of Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring concert. HUHS transferred the call to HUPD, who then transferred the call to CPD. HUPD spokespeople have said “jurisdictional requirements” mandated that HUPD transfer the call to CPD.
CPD had jurisdiction because the student—who was standing on a median in the middle of the road feet from Harvard Law School’s campus—was not standing on campus and was thus outside HUPD’s jurisdiction. HUPD has to inform other police departments of incidents that take place off Harvard’s campus, per policy.
When CPD officers arrived on the scene, the student was naked, and acquaintances of the undergraduate told police he had previously taken narcotics, according to the CPD police report. At least 30 people soon gathered to watch the incident, according to the report.
Four officers approached the student and stood talking with him for at least several seconds. The police report states the undergraduate was “acting completely irrational” and that “every attempt that was made to calm [the student] down and reason with him was met with opposition.”
The report calls the undergraduate’s behavior “aggressive, hostile, and intimidating,” and notes that the student “clinch[ed] both his fists” before he “started to take steps towards officers in an aggressive manner.”
Police then decided to tackle the student to the ground, according to the report.
But eyewitnesses of the event—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated that CPD’s version of events is “incorrect.” The eyewitnesses say the police tackled the student “without provocation.”
“A naked, unarmed Black man, stood still on the median,” a statement issued by BLSA reads. “He was surrounded by at least four Cambridge Police Department (CPD) officers who, without provocation, lunged at him, tackled him and pinned him to the ground.”
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times shows three officers surrounding the student and negotiating with him for several seconds. A fourth officer initially has his back to the scene.
The student takes two steps forward, one step back, and raises his arms mid-way up his chest. A police officer standing behind the student then tackles him to the ground. Two other officers rush to help subdue the student, and another officer runs into view to aid the others. In total, four officers ultimately attempt to pin down the student.
“While on the ground, at least one officer repeatedly punched the student in his torso as he screamed for help,” the BLSA statement reads.
The police report acknowledges one officer punched the student in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin his arms and handcuff the undergraduate. The report calls the punches “ineffective.”
The police then cuffed the student’s arms and legs before loading him into an ambulance, where he spat “a mixture of blood and saliva” at an ambulance technician, according to the report. The student was transported to an unidentified hospital, where he remains under police custody.
The BLSA statement notes that a “pool of blood remained on the pavement” as the ambulance departed.
HUPD officers initially charged the student arrested in 2006 with two counts of assault and battery of a police officer, possession of marijuana, and possession of a fake ID. Officers found marijuana in pants the undergraduate left behind in Quincy.
But all charges were dropped several months after the student’s arrest. He was placed on pretrial probation, allowing him to evade criminal penalties if he avoided legal trouble for one year. The Administrative Board voted to allow the student to return to the College after one semester of time off.
It is as of yet unclear how the black student arrested in 2018 will fare. After the arrest, he was charged with assault, resisting arrest, indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault and battery of ambulance personnel.
Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said at a press conference Monday that CPD may drop the charges against the student.
Asked why the student was charged if there are concerns over the undergraduate’s mental health, Bard said Monday that the department is currently trying to decide whether the student would be better served if CPD moves forward with his case by “means other than the criminal justice system.”
It is unclear when—or if—the student will face arraignment.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that any decision made would be done so “in consultation with various agencies” which could include the hospital and the District Attorney’s Office.
“In Friday’s case, a determination on timing for charges proceeding or not would not be clear until the individual’s in-patient treatment concludes or progresses. That decision would be done in consultation with various agencies,” he wrote.
As for disciplinary proceedings on the part of the College, that too remains unclear. Asked multiple different questions about whether the student is likely to face an Ad Board case and how criminal charges might affect that case, Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement that he could not comment.
“We do not comment on individual student cases before the Ad. Board, nor can we comment on a hypothetical case,” Goldman wrote.
Guidelines posted on the Ad Board’s website state that Ad Board cases begin with “an allegation in the form of a complaint or report,” which can be made by a Harvard affiliate or by another agency like the police.
The website also includes a section discussing allegations of “serious criminal conduct”; the guidelines stipulate an Ad Board case may be postponed or suspended until a criminal case has been concluded.
“[S]tudents are advised to seek legal advice about how the College’s disciplinary process could affect any criminal case in which they may be involved,” the guidelines read. “Ordinarily, if a complaint is being pursued through the criminal justice system, the Board may assess the timing of the investigation so that it does not compromise the integrity of the criminal investigation.”
Editor’s Note: The Crimson is withholding the name of the student involved in the 2018 incident out of concern for his privacy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fairfax is a modest town in Northern Virginia. Comprised of exactly 6.3 square miles of territory and home to just over 22,000 people, the suburb is most notable for being the scene of the first land battle of the Civil War. This weekend it will host another. For the first time in the division’s modern era, the EIVA men’s volleyball tournament will head to the home gym of George Mason University.
Harvard (11-13, 10-4 EIVA) is one of the four teams that will be descending on the campus in an effort to grab a contest trophy and punch it’s ticket to the national tournament. Seeded third, as determined by the team’s divisional rank in the regular season, the Crimson will square up against No. 2 seeded Penn State (15-10, 10-4) in the semi-final match Thursday at 5 p.m in the Patriots’ Recreation and Athletic Complex.
“We’re feeling confident going into what will be our third match against Penn State this year,” sophomore libero Jack Connolly said. “Coming off an exciting five set win a few weeks ago, we feel we have all the tools to compete at a high level and make a run this postseason.”
The trip South is a familiar one for Harvard, which made it less than a week ago for a weekend double-header against the now division champs. With the two ensuing losses, the Crimson ceded both the regular season title and home court advantage for the tournament to George Mason (17-11, 13-1). Now the team must return to face another familiar opponent.
The Patriots’ drought in hosting EIVA final four tournaments can be attributed to the fact that the Nittany Lions have not failed to secure a division title in 11 years. This season, however, Harvard introduced a little variation into the championship proceedings when it bested Penn State in a five set thriller late in March. The victory precluded the frequent champ from topping the podium, but as a result, forced the two into a semi-final grudge match this week.
In comparing the two teams, history clearly sides with the Nittany Lions. Throughout the course of the rivalry, the Crimson has bested Penn State just twice in 18 meetings. Prior to Harvard’s 2018 victory, it had been five matches and over two years since the squad had even managed to notch a single set on its Pennsylvania opponent.
That all changed on March 31, 2018. In front of a standing-room only crowd at Malkin Athletic Center, the five-match streak ended when the Crimson stunned the Nittany Lions in the opening set of the contest, putting up 25 before the visitors could hit 15. The next set Harvard won with 32 points. While it would take five sets to secure the win, the result was the same: Penn State was not the EIVA regular season champ.
It is only fitting that it was the Crimson that denied the Nittany Lions their first regular season title in 11 seasons. Though Harvard only boasts two wins ever against the program, the only other win ended Penn State’s deafening 51-game conference winning streak back in 2013.
Another win this year, however, is no guarantee. The Crimson’s earlier victory was preceded by a 3-0 loss to the Nittany Lions in mid-February.
“I think we had much more confidence when we played them the second time,” said captain outside hitter Jack Heavey. “We were coming off of six conference wins in a row and had really found, and played to, our identity as a team.”
While Harvard certainly has EIVA playoff experience, it pales in comparison to Penn State’s near hegemony. In his 10th season as head coach, Brain Baise has led the Crimson to five playoff berths. In the last six years, however, Harvard has advanced to only a single EIVA title match. That outlier came in 2013, the last year the squad downed the Nittany Lions in the regular season. In the proceeding championship game, Penn State disposed of the Crimson in a clean three sets.
Now the team stands between Harvard and a return to the tournament’s final match.
“We’ve been focusing both on playing our game as well as we can in addition to figuring out how we can slow down some of their best players,” Connolly said. “We’re taking this one match at a time but we believe this team is well poised to have success this postseason.”
The winner of the Nittany Lions and the Crimson will face the victor of No. 1 seeded George Mason and No. 4 seeded Princeton (11-15, 7-7). The Patriots arrive to the tournament sporting a resume of one conference loss—coming from Penn State in five sets on April 7—and a clean two-game run over Harvard last weekend. The Tigers pushed their last match with George Mason to five sets and last weekend bested the Nittany Lions in three sets before falling to St. Francis.
This season, the Crimson split with Penn State, the Nittany Lions haven’t beat Princeton, and the Tigers haven’t beat Harvard. With a Fairfax, Va., tournament on the horizon, seeds two through four are a mess. Alone at the forefront stand the Patriots with one division loss, the clear tournament favorite.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to 2014, the soccer scene at Harvard was composed entirely of varsity and club soccer. Seeing a demand for a more casual and inclusive way for students to play the game they love, Dawit Gebregziabher ’16 and Henry Scott ’18 founded the Harvard Futsal Club.
Starting off as small casual group of soccer enthusiasts, Harvard Club Futsal has expanded to an organization that today has more members than almost all other club sports on campus.
“I’m very proud to have witnessed the evolution of the club in the past four years and its growth from twelve members and one session per week to over 150 members and three sessions per week,” Gebregziabher said. “The club fills an existing need on the campus and it has been a great pleasure to be involved.”
Although futsal does not get as much publicity as soccer, its players insist it is just as enjoyable. Futsal is essentially an indoor version of soccer, usually played on a basketball court with small nets on either end. The rules are more loose than those in soccer. There is no referee, there are no offsides, there are no fouls, and no out of bounds. In fact, sending the ball off of the walls is all a part of the strategy of the game.
In soccer, the players who are most disciplined, in the best shape, and have the strongest boot have advantages over other players. In futsal a different strategy is required. The players that are the most creative, skilled, and even unconventional often excel in the indoor game.
At Harvard, earning a spot in the more “structured” version of club soccer can be extremely difficult. Tryouts for men’s club soccer happen every September around the first week of school. There is very little space on the roster for new players. Even with the low odds, 100 people try out and only around three to six new players are taken on the team each season.
“In order to be one of the few to ultimately earn an invite to regular practice, you have to stand out quickly among the rest of the players,” Scott said. “Usually one stands out through one's playing style and decision making, and most often those who manage to catch the eye happen to be players with experience playing the 11v11 soccer in organized and competitive conditions.”
Women’s club soccer tryouts can be equally as competitive. Usually around 30 to 50 women try out while only between four to twelve girls make the cut. The amount of people who show up every year to both the men and women’s teams demonstrate the massive interest in spaces on campus where people can play the game. Futsal seeks to create those spaces.
Because futsal is open to anyone and allows everyone to play, it creates a pick-up style, recreational environment compared to the organized practices and drills of club sports. The structure also means that the people who take time out of their week to go play club futsal also happen to be extremely passionate about the sport.
“As an international student who grew up playing the game, I understood the popularity of informal pickup games especially among other internationals.” said Gebregziabher in a written statement. “There were and still are other groups for organizing pickup but due to the weather they are often limited to playing from late spring to early fall. The club was thus setup to give students a way to play year-round, including the winter months.”
At a typical club futsal session, there are about 15 to 25 graduate and undergraduate students of both genders that show up to play. The attendees are randomly separated into different teams. Each team has a goalie and four field players. Club futsal plays five minute games or until one team scores in order to get more playing time for everyone.
“The game is fast-paced and everywhere: side walls are fair game, no refs, no fouls,” Scott said. “Here, creativity and unconventional maneuvering take precedence over physicality and any amount of years of academy-level training. Deficiencies in form—atypical ball-handling techniques, risky decision-making—here are met with admiration, or, if especially weird but successful, hysterical cheers. Because of this, futsal is more open to an array of playing styles.”
The organizational structure of Harvard Club Futsal naturally incentivizes meeting new people. The teams are mixed up every time they meet, so every time there are different people on different teams. Oftentimes no two people on a team are from the same country.
There is also some overlap between club soccer players and futsal players despite the difference in styles of play of the two games. Club futsal attracts people who grew up playing street, and other unconventional forms of soccer. Every time club futsal meets, there are both men and women present, people from various countries, and people who play soccer in different ways.
“Most people who show up are soccer fans and lots of people come in their team’s jersey,” said sophomore club soccer and futsal player Cameron Jones. “It creates an atmosphere that’s really vibrant because everyone’s talking about Ronaldo’s bicycle kick goal, or the latest round of Champions League games and arguing about players and teams.”
The club has expanded from meeting once a week on Saturdays to three sessions a week. There are members who have competed in professional futsal leagues in Europe and players who have never played on an organized team.
It is rare at Harvard to find a space or group that does not require a “comp” process or a tryout. Between the uniquely passionate and diverse students who are part of Harvard Club Futsal, all that is needed is a love for soccer.

It’s Visitas weekend, which means hordes of confused prefrosh will be flooding campus. Prefrosh have an excited sparkle in their eyes and can remind hardened Harvard students of the magic they once saw in this place, but if you’re already a grumpy “it’s almost finals” student, you’ll probably just see them as a traffic jam and an annoyance. However, no matter who you are, you can benefit from Visitas. All of those classic Visitas events that sound super fun and promise great free food are back, and while they’re technically for prefrosh, is there really anything stopping you from pretending to go back in time for a little while? If you want to get the most out of Visitas, or at least eat some tasty food, here are some standout events.
A New ChalLANger Approaches—SOCH Room 105Saturday, 4/21 at 4:30 p.m.
A little niche, but if you’re looking for some way to be social but not actually have to talk much then look no further! Tons of video games and prefrosh Player 2s with which to prove that your Smash Bros. skills are much better than your Pset skills.
European Pastries and Drinks—Harvard Hall 102Saturday 4/21 at 6:30 p.m.
This one’s got a little bit of preparation necessary but tons of reward. As an event geared towards meeting European students, you’ll probably want to create a backstory so you aren’t outed as the American you really are. Just whatever you do, don’t fake an accent; they’ll know and you’ll have to wave goodbye to all the cannolis and macarons.
Make Your Own Japanese Rice Ball—Annenberg HallSaturday 4/21 at 9:30 p.m.

Bid any concept of a normal brain break adieu and check out this event instead. If the title doesn’t convince you, nothing we could write will.
Pastries, Crepes, Political Consulting—Harvard Hall, 102Sunday, 4/22 at 10:30 a.m.
Well, at least the first two words sound appetizing. Looking to ditch classic Sunday brunch for something a little more upscale? Looking to ditch the low-earning potential careers that your concentration leads to for one that might be a little more lucrative? This event has got you covered.
Boba and Board Games—PBHASunday, 4/22 at 9 p.m.
Want bubble tea? The answer is probably yes, and you can probably get in and out of PBHA pretty quickly while pretending to be a pre-frosh. No particular participatory events are necessary, though if you really want to get into it and play some board games with prefrosh, go for it.
International Dessert Fest—Ticknor LoungeSunday, 4/22 at 9 p.m.
What’s better than sugar, sugar, and more sugar? International sugar! Justify your indulgence under the guise of cultural exploration, and join the feast.
As finals approach and we get more desperate to add joy to our lives, consider joining the crowds of hopeful future Harvard students and make the most of Visitas. Any and all of these events would make great study breaks, so Visitas here we come!

With Visitas on the horizon, there’s only one question on our minds: Can you -tas that? As if “Visitas” isn’t cringe enough, Harvard seems to feel a need to remind us of the ever-present Veritas by throwing -tas at the end of every single word. We’re here to judge some current uses of -tas, and to suggest some others.
The canonical “Partytas”
Any good Visitas story starts with, “We went to Partytas, but it was lame so we left.” With a name like that, how could anyone expect it not to be lame? They might as well name the event “Harvard is a school where your social life comes to die” and at least let prefrosh know what they’re getting themselves into.
The new addition “Karaokitas”
Move over Partytas, there’s a new terribly named and terribly executed social event on the scene. No, Harvard, you definitely cannot and should not -tas that.
The laudable “Carnitas”
Honorable mention to the Latinx community for boasting the only bearable -tas event on the Visitas calendar this year. Harvard administrators have a lot to learn from these innovative leaders.
We suggest: “Insecuritas”
Feeling secure seeing all those Securitas signs around campus? Think again, prefrosh. Get ready to be very insecure when you realize that every other member of your class already competed in the Olympics and nailed down a finance internship for the summer of 2020.
We suggest: “Let’s-grab-a-mealitas”
A Visitas event where prefrosh plan to get meals together in the fall, but proceed to forget each other’s names immediately after making the promise. Time to assimilate the prefrosh into the flakey culture of this school.
Happy tas-ing, everyone!
