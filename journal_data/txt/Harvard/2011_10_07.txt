After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A source of some consternation every year is the disproportionate percentage of Harvard seniors who are immediately swallowed up by consulting firms and investment banks come graduation. Of course, the numbers vary from year to year for a variety of reasons—for example, due presumably to the stock market crash in the fall of 2008, the percentage of graduates going into consulting and investment banking cratered, plunging from 47 percent in 2007 to 39 percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2009. Regardless of the ups and downs, however, it is hard to deny that in any given year, finance can be counted on to play an outsized role in the future of the collective Harvard senior class. This disparity between the proportion of graduates entering the financial sector and the proportion of those entering more service-oriented fields may lead some to form mistaken conclusions about the motivations of Harvard students.
However, we believe that the success of the recruiting practices of Teach For America demonstrate that what attracts graduates is not so much the financial sector’s monetary allurements as it is the sense of security provided by its heavily structured nature. In adopting the “corporate approach” to recruitment, TFA has thus embraced the reassuring structure of consulting firms and investment banks. Furthermore, TFA has also sought to entice graduates of the nation’s top universities by engendering an “aura of status and selectivity,” as TFA founder and CEO Wendy S. Kopp describes it in her senior thesis, “An Argument and Plan for the Creation of the Teachers Corporation.”
Beyond structure and status, TFA further caters to Harvard graduates in particular. For example, TFA, Google, and McKinsey & Co. were initial recruiting partners for the Harvard Business School 2 + 2 Program. The result? Eighteen percent of Harvard’s 2011 graduating class applied to TFA, a proportion which, while clearly lagging behind applicants for the financial sector, is still formidable in its own right. What is significant about this number, however, is that it reflects, contrary to the narrative encouraged by the dominance of consulting firms and investment banks in post-graduation careers, that there is a vibrant contingent of Harvard seniors going into public service professions upon graduation.
While there is nothing inherently faulty in pursuing a career in the financial sector, we believe that it is the effects can only be positive for more industries and fields to adopt the “corporate approach” as TFA has in order to maximize the array of viable career paths to students to consider after graduation. There is no reason why only students who go into consulting and investment banking should enjoy the benefits of structure and status that they provide, and TFA has proven that that model is widely applicable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a Congressional Black Caucus gala in September, President Obama exhorted his supporters to “stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying.” Despite the fatuous indignation of the likes of Representative Maxine Waters—thrice ranked one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics—over these remarks, Obama was right to call liberals out for their armchair petulance. The president’s CBC speech, along with his futile campaign for the American Jobs Act, amounted to a desperate effort to galvanize liberals for 2012, and that such an effort is necessary for a president who has overseen the greatest advancement of liberal legislation since the Great Society is simply baffling.
This summer, in a New York Times tantrum that has since become a canonical text for querulous liberals, Emory psychologist Drew Westen asked, “What happened to Obama?” Perhaps the more pertinent question, however, is, “What happened to Obama supporters?”
Some degree of liberal disenchantment was inevitable. Idealistic insurgency of the sort embodied by Obama ’08 will always out-inspire reaffirmation of the status quo, which Obama ‘12 would have represented even if he had by now enacted every plank of the Democratic platform and was presiding over full employment to boot. Furthermore, liberals are vindicable in their umbrage at Obama’s specific indiscretions on civil liberties and gay marriage. But the sweeping degree of liberal discontent is just pathetic, for their disappointment in the President’s foreseeable inability to meet their comically inflated expectations is a direct consequence of their naïve belief in his ability to meet them in the first place.
Obama cannot be faulted for this grossly fantastical outlook that his campaign engendered; presidential candidates customarily promise the moon to get elected, be they John McCain vowing a balanced budget by 2012 or Michele Bachmann guaranteeing $2/gallon gas. Responsibility for any ensuing disillusionment, therefore, rests exclusively with those guileless enough to partake of the snake oil peddled by pander-prone politicians.
Some of this naïveté can be attributed to such sentiments as liberal commentator David Sirota’s assertion that “Most agree that today's imperial presidency almost singularly determines the course of national politics.” Sirota betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the modern presidency and its continuing dependence on congressional compliance for any shred of domestic agency, claiming also that Obama “has mustered the legislative strength of [Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1908],” which is wildly inaccurate.
Liberals often lament the lost opportunity for a second New Deal, but how they expected Obama to achieve with a 7-point popular mandate, 60 Senate Democrats, and 255 House Democrats what Roosevelt achieved with an 18-point popular mandate, 76 Senate Democrats, and 334 House Democrats, they never explain. In spite of this disadvantage, Obama was still able achieve what Roosevelt couldn’t—universal healthcare. But rather than exult in this historic achievement, liberals chose to sulk over the comparative triviality of the public option.
Liberals also elide in their analysis the moderation of Obama’s electoral coalition, 63 percent of whom identified as moderate or conservative. Could it be that some of those 63 percent desired not another New Deal but, rather, the post-partisan conciliation that Obama promised? Were liberals simply not listening when Obama said “There is not a liberal America or a conservative America”?
By directing their ire at Obama for the failure to undo in two years forty years of conservative governance with majorities smaller than either Roosevelt’s or Lyndon B. Johnson’s, liberals implicitly pooh-pooh the role of the opposition party, whose uniform truculence has endowed them with unprecedented leverage in spite of their minority status. How was Obama to counter promiscuous parliamentary obstruction, lock-step legislative opposition, Fox News propaganda, Tea Party vitriol, Koch cash, and the suicidal determination of the Republican Party to destroy him at all costs? Simple, say liberals: Use the bully pulpit.
Ah, the fabled bully pulpit. Liberals remain transfixed by the delusion of, in the formulation of New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait, an Aaron Sorkin-esque “Democratic president who would simply advocate for unvarnished liberalism…and sweep along the public with the force of his conviction.” Liberals propose that better messaging by the Obama administration would overpower the structural impediments of a doddering economy, a sclerotic political system, and an entropic media culture. History suggests otherwise.
To begin with, Obama recently adopted the bully pulpiteer model of the presidency with his American Jobs Act tour, and yet the anticipated wave of public support has, astonishingly, failed to materialize. Furthermore, this style of presidential leadership was attempted once before by another modern president—George W. Bush. Bush’s 2005 crusade for the partial privatization of Social Security is perhaps the finest modern example of the power of the bully pulpit being put to the test. We all know what the results of that test were.
By invoking the specious mythology of the bully pulpit, liberals blind themselves to the reality of their plight and their own culpability. It is not Obama’s poor communication skills that have resulted in the nation’s sharp right turn. No, by devoting so much energy to attacking the president from the left and blaming his lack of leadership for their demobilization rather than mobilizing themselves, liberals have essentially left Obama alone in the fight against the Republicans. And in a battle between left and right in which the left attacks the left and the right attacks the left, who do they expect to win?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a gap in our understanding of how gender equality came to be. Where the civil rights movement conjures pictures of leaders and protests, our main images of women’s liberation are a court case and a box of birth control. Somehow, we sense the place of women improved, but how, and by whom?
What’s in that gap is the radical feminist movement of the 1970s, and you will find it taught in very few classes at Harvard this semester. This must change. 
Every couple of years, someone brings the claim that there are not enough women on Harvard syllabi. These observations are usually dismissed as the unfortunate results of historical inequality. Women did not write in the time when such thoughts were being produced, therefore they cannot be studied.
It’s true that such inequality exists—in the distant past.
But the radical feminists, active only 40 years ago, were a group of women who wrote together, fought together and accomplished real advances for Americans. To forget the radical feminists is to ignore much of the social change that has taken place in America in the last fifty years. As writer and radical feminist Ellen Willis (whose papers can be read in the Schlesinger Library) has argued, “Radical feminists sparked the drive to legalize abortion and created the atmosphere of urgency in which liberal feminists were finally able to the Equal Rights Amendment through Congress and most of the states.” Radical feminism made women aware that despite claims of equality, their gender was being held against them. It demanded equality in both public and private life.
To overlook radical feminism is also to overlook an intellectual movement which shook at the foundations of almost every aspect of daily experience. It made sexual politics a national issue, Willis writes. It sought to redefine social constructs like marriage in more daring ways than the current conversations. “Radical feminism is our [American] philosophical achievement on par with European post-structuralism, but more practical, deeper, more activist, more productive of change, less hermetic,” Mark Greif ’97 wrote in a recent issue of the journal N+1. Feminist thinkers pushed their readers to reexamine language, birth and love; they challenged critical texts for not going far enough.
No one would argue that post-structuralism has not changed the way modern intellectuals think, even as it goes out of favor and its claims continue to be re-examined. That’s why it’s used as theory in the literature concentration, studied in intellectual history, and read in government and social studies.
Radical feminism deserves the same treatment. Radical feminism belongs, not only in the Women, Gender and Sexuality courses, but in any survey of post-war thought or civil movements. As one example: Professor Kloppenberg should expand his single postwar feminism lecture in “Social Thought in Modern America” into several. Students should read Shulamith Firestone, Ti-Grace Atkinson and Ellen Willis, each the founder or co-founder of a radical feminist group. alongside Betty Friedan, currently on the syllabus. While it is true that, as Professor Kloppenberg acknowledged to me by email, a survey course does not have the time to delve deeply into any one of its subjects, it should give a full taste of the movements it proposes to cover. Radical feminism should be read in any course on critical inquiry; its oversights and shortcomings should be discussed in context instead of used as an argument against its worth.
I’ve frequently heard the complaint that women today don’t want to be called feminist, that they think “feminism” is a dirty word. Who can blame them? If someone wanted to know what a feminist was, where could she look? Many foundational feminist texts, like Firestone’s “Dialectic of Sex”, are out of print. In a few years, most of the members of the Redstockings and New York Radical Women will be dead, and many of their papers have not yet been archived into national or university collections. Radical feminists have been all but forgotten by the academy and if this absence persists, they risk being obliterated from the record of American history.
If Harvard is committed to upholding the truth, then it must include a social movement that changed the lives and thoughts of Americans as part of the narrative it presents of the twentieth century. Maybe then we can finally revise a historical tradition that has forgotten its major actors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all of our supposed intellectual prowess, Harvard students often sound like we are speaking nonsense. The fact that we have our own set of vocabulary to describe ordinary actions and events—“comp,” “concentrate,” and “punch”—makes us incomprehensible to the outside world after we graduate until we realize that these words aren’t recognized elsewhere. Going into the real world, Harvard students need to understand that there are some words that do not exist outside of the Harvard sphere. Insisting on their use—especially without explanation—can be irritating and unnecessary.
When I first arrived at Harvard, I felt like Harry at Hogwarts—and not in the good way. Like Harry, who questioned the meanings of words like, “quidditch” and “platform 9 ¾,” I constantly felt surrounded by a strange dialect that no one was willing to explain. I was lost. My conversations would go something like the this:
“You’re comping the Crimson?”
“Um,  I’m trying out. What’s ‘comp’?”
“Oh you’re such a freshman!”
“Well yes, thanks, I get that. But really, what is a ‘comp’?”
Granted, all schools have words, places, and people specific to their culture and lifestyle. It is impossible to fully grasp the unique identity of a school until you are fully immersed in its traditions and get to know its students, abbreviations, and classes. But Harvard is unique in its lack of any real explanation for freshmen on Harvard diction. Freshmen are left on their own to flounder through the first few weeks of essentially learning a new language without any direction. Many Harvard students unthinkingly bring their newfound vocabulary words into the world outside of Harvard. Here, however, no one cares to hear them—and rightfully so.
In my experience, when friends from other schools use abbreviations or unknown phrases, they often explain them. “I’m working for Colby’s SAA this semester—their Student Alumni Association,” I’ve been told, with the consideration that I would not automatically understand what SAA stood for. Harvard students, on the other hand, often tend to barrel on as if their audience is instantly expected to know what “IOP” or “Pfoho” are (I mean, how could they not?). By the end of the conversation, the only “punching” this audience likely understands is the kind that is directed at the speaker’s face.
Freshmen need to have crucial words explained to them upon arrival or upon use in conversation. Peer Advising Fellow (PAF) meeting number one should tell us that concentration means major, that a House is a dorm for upperclassmen. It may sound silly, petty, and condescending, but it’s hard to feel part of a community as a freshman when you don’t know what on earth anyone is talking about. For the first few weeks of freshmen year, I thought the abbreviation for Freshman Arts Program, or FAP, was a type of soft drink.
One could argue that freshmen ought to do their research and figure these things out before their arrival. However, this is unrealistic: it is a well-accepted truth that you cannot expect to know everything you need to know about a school until you begin attending classes there.  On the other hand, it doesn’t seem nearly as unreasonable to expect that someone at the school would explain the terminology of the school to students once they have begun attending.
Here’s one word everyone understands: obnoxious. Let’s stop acting that way, and learn to use words that are universally accepted.

Since 1974, when Richard H. Meadow ’68 began excavating at the archaeological site of Harappa in Pakistan, trash has been essential to his work.
When the ruins of the Indus civilization were first uncovered, archaeologists observed brick settlements that had grown upward in time. The vertical rise was caused by the ancient practice of dumping trash into the streets, which piled up and blocked doorways. The city’s inhabitants were forced to knock down old structures and build on top of them, leading to mounds up to 20 meters high.
Meadow, the director of the Peabody Museum’s Zooarchaeology laboratory, spoke on “The Archaeologist’s View of Trash” at the Geological Lecture Hall last night. His lecture was the third in a series titled “Trash Talk: The Anthropology of Waste” and organized by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
Trash is often the exclusive source for understanding ancient civilizations in regions without a textual record, said Meadow, who is also a senior lecturer on anthropology. In his field work at the settlement, he has examined middens, or ancient dumping sites, to study the daily lives of the Harappans. From miniature figurines to fragments of Harappan vessels, objects that were once tossed away are to him priceless treasures.
Researchers also used the trash deposits to carbon date the civilization to 3600 to 1500 B.C. Furthermore, the deposits can be analyzed, using the remnants of long-decayed plants, to determine the diet of the Harappa people.
Pamela D. Gerardi, director of external relations at the Peabody Museum, is the organizer of the “Trash Talk” series which continues into Spring 2012. After the museum hosted a series on writing systems last year, she said she wanted to again focus on a specific topic and decided on trash because “it’s relevant, it’s timely, it’s something that concerns us all.”
Gerardi said the series isn’t about telling people a specific way to think about trash. She said that “when most of us have trash, we throw it away and never think about it again.” Instead, she said society should start by asking, “Where does it go when it goes away?”
The previous talk in the series was delivered by Susan Strasser, a professor of American history at the University of Delaware, and focused on trash during the Industrial Revolution. Future speakers will come from a variety of disciplines, including urban design, philosophy, and contemporary art, each presenting trash from a different angle.
For the time being, Meadow offered a unique perspective as a professional dumpster diver of sorts.
“Our view of trash, as archaeologists ... is quite different,” said Meadow. “It’s something I always look forward to getting my hands into when I go to an archaeological site.”

Women who wear makeup are perceived as more attractive and competent than those who do not, according to a recently released study headed by Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Nancy L. Etcoff.
The study, titled “Cosmetics as a Feature of the Extended Human Phenotype: Modulation of the Perception of Biologically Important Facial Signals,” asked participants to judge a variety of women’s photographs based on a number of characteristics including attractiveness, competence, likeability, and trustworthiness.
Researchers were particularly interested to see how makeup affected judgments both automatically and after longer deliberation, they said.
“I’m interested in bringing science to the study of adornment,” said Etcoff, a psychology professor who has studied this topic for over 20 years. “The study aimed to address exactly what we look at when we judge a person, and what these tools do.”
The study, which involved researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Procter & Gamble Cosmetics, Boston University, and HMS, was first released in the online publication PLoS ONE on Monday.
In the study, two groups, each with over one hundred participants, were asked to rate photographs of female faces with varying levels of “color cosmetics” applied by a professional makeup artist. Participants in the first group only saw the photographs for 250 milliseconds, while those in the second group had an unlimited amount of time to examine them.
Judging a number of qualities, participants then used a sliding scale to input their ratings directly into a computer. The responses were sent to a statistician at Dana-Farber.
Findings revealed that cosmetics have a significant and automatic effect on judgments of attractiveness. Even more importantly, makeup provides additional facial stimuli that influence more long-term, deliberative judgments on social factors such as trustworthiness.
Sarah A. Vickery, co-researcher for the study and principal scientist at Procter & Gamble Beauty and Grooming, summarized these findings in an interview with CBS News.
“This means that makeup really can be seen as a tool in a woman’s arsenal that allows her to actually control the way the world sees her,” she said in the interview.
But despite the physically-oriented implications of these findings, the study also revealed that positive perception decreases as women apply heavier makeup. To this end, Etcoff emphasized that in no way should the study imply that women need to use cosmetics or abide by social convention.
“People don’t want to judge a book by its cover, and yet they still do,” she said. “But what matters is how we perceive ourselves. Women can still be confident and competent without makeup."

In their upcoming book, “The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,” Harvard Government Professor Theda R. Skocpol and graduate student Vanessa S. Williamson argue that the grassroots movement has garnered support from several different sources, the chief of which are the election of President Barack Obama and the subsequent energetic initiative of local activists.
Skocpol and Williamson traveled across the country conducting interviews, attending public rallies, and sitting in on private Tea Party meetings to peel back stereotypes associated with the movement. Through that process, they came to know the people behind the movement, Skocpol said.
“[The Tea Party] was something we didn’t understand, that didn’t fit the available categories,” Skocpol said. “We wanted to figure out why it was having such a big impact on national debates and where it might be going next.”
The book, which is to be published in January, combines anecdotal research from the field with survey data and other statistical evidence to present a scholarly analysis of a widely discussed, yet poorly understood demographic.
Their research identifies three primary, interacting components of the Tea Party: local organizers and activists (“the ones who dress up in tri-cornered hats”), the conservative media that helped launch the Tea Party in its early stages, and conservative advocacy groups that have funneled money into the movement as they latched onto its success.
In particular, the election of Barack Obama served as the impetus for these conservative groups to come together, Skocpol said.
“[Obama is] actually a pretty moderate guy, but for them he symbolizes the devil—foreign father, young people love him, wants to have health care reform that will give benefits to lower-income people,” Skocpol said.
But both Skocpol and Williamson are careful to refrain from passing judgment about the Tea Partiers and their political leanings.
“Their views are based on a different set of facts than others are, but it’s not like these people are naive or aren’t thinking through problems or aren’t concerned about the future,” Williamson said.
While conservative Tea Partiers were at first hesitant to talk, especially with a Harvard professor, both authors observed that once the conversation got started, they revealed a more human touch.
“Face to face, these turn out to be folks, with all the distinctive qualities of, for example, your grandma,” Skocpol said.
After reading the book, University of Minnesota Political Science Professor Larry R. Jacobs also commented on some of the Tea Party’s nuances.
“I can’t think of a single book that is more apt for our times in clearing up confusion and revealing the most important tensions in American politics today between populist revolts, crumbling markets, and Republican politics,” Jacobs said.
As the country readies itself for next year’s presidential election, both authors are confident that their upcoming book will resonate with curious audiences.
“It’s a book that people generally interested in politics, who want to understand what happened in the last few years, will find interesting,” Williamson said.

Harvard students can enjoy 20 percent off their entire purchase at Boloco Friday. The discount kicks off the Undergraduate Council’s newest initiative—UC Restaurants, a program in which the UC will partner with restaurants in the Cambridge area to provide exclusive discounts to Harvard students.
The deals—which the UC intends to offer twice a month—will be publicized in the UC Weekly, an email that is sent out to the undergraduate body at the beginning of every week. The program is aimed at fostering connections between the undergraduate student body and the surrounding community.
“My hope is that this will provide a new avenue for students to branch out and explore Cambridge while fostering positive relationships between Harvard students and the Cambridge community,” said Nicholas Galat ’13, a Quincy House representative and the chair of the Student Initiatives Committee.
According to Galat, the inspiration for the idea came after talking with friends from other universities who are able to get discounts at local businesses by simply presenting their college ID. But making the idea a reality proved to be quite difficult, he said, and the biggest challenge was building a critical mass of support for the program.
“The idea has been there for quite some time, but last year it stayed within the committee and no one took an active role in going out and talking to people about making it happen,” Galat said. “As the new SIC chair, my first goal this year was to get the ball rolling.”
According to Galat, the program has received a positive response from a variety of restaurants in Harvard Square, and Friday Bolocco will be the first sponsor.
“We are going to limit the program to restaurants for now because we like the idea of groups of students going together to eat outside of the dining halls on weekends,” Galat said. “We really want to encourage engagement outside of main House areas.”
In addition to this new initiative, SIC is also looking to improve student social life by increasing the popularity of the Student Initiated Programs fund, which provides students up to $500 to throw parties in House common spaces. Funds from SIP can be used to purchase alcohol, unlike other party grants. SIP—which received approval last year—is still trying to gain the full support of House Masters.
“We have only been able to successfully host events in four Houses thus far,” Galat said. “But we hope that as we begin to sponsor successful events we will gain support and be able to expand the program into other Houses by the end of the year.”

Emmy Award-winning actor Laura L. Linney came to Cambridge Thursday and taught her fans how to act.
The audience of about 100 at a studio at Harvard’s New College Theatre on Thursday listened as Linney talked about how she brings characters to life.
Known for her performances in “Love Actually” and the HBO mini-series “John Adams,” Linney’s latest role is that of Cathy Jamison, a woman with cancer who decides not to tell her family, in Showtimes’ “The Big C.” She has won three Emmy Awards, two Golden Globes, and a Screen Actors Guild Award and landed lead roles in a broad range of films, plays, and television shows.
Linney’s talk was part of the Office for the Art at Harvard’s “Learning From Performers” program, which aims to facilitate dialogue among performers about the creative process.
Linney grew up on the stage. Tagging along with her playwright father, Romulus Z. Linney, she would sit in the corners of New York City theaters, watching and listening to the actors who shaped her identity as a creature of the stage.
But when the event’s moderator asked her about the moment that she decided she wanted to pursue acting, Linney shook her head.
“I didn’t decide, it was just something that I was,” Linney said.
Even decades later, Linney can remember the play that began to shape her as an actor—a production of “Vanities” in a church basement. In the play, the three leading ladies “ping-ponged” off each other in a bubbly yet orchestrated performance, Linney said.
“I could hear each melody,” Linney said. “I saw how it all connected.”
Bouncing among prep schools and colleges, Linney struggled to find her fit until she settled on studying theater history at Brown University. Although she wasn’t the most polished student, she said, Linney attributes her academic success to her curious mind.
Linney’s academic career was not always smooth sailing. After graduating from Brown, Linney moved on to the Juilliard School, where she gained experience and developed her skills as an actor. But in her fourth year at Juilliard, Linney said she hit a wall and seriously considered dropping out.
Luckily for her fans, Linney’s teacher gave her the advice that got Linney back into the acting game: school is the time to fail, she remembered her teacher saying. From that failure, her teacher said, one can start practicing one’s craft without fear of failure.
Linney tried to communicate the lessons she learned as an actor to the audience populated by adoring fans and a smattering of budding actors.
Instead of paying close attention to her facial expressions and mannerisms on the screen, Linney said she tries to think like her character.
“What I love about the theater is that you’re constantly a student,” Linney said.

Once called the “Rosa Parks of legal education” by President Obama, Derrick A. Bell—the first tenured black professor at Harvard Law School—died Wednesday night. He was 80 years old.
Bell—whose career at the Law School was marked by stands he took in favor of increased diversity—resigned from the Law School in 1992 in protest of the dearth of women of color on the faculty.
Bell has been heralded as a legal pioneer of race and civil rights, writing and teaching extensively about his perception of race in America. His book, “Race, Racism, and American Law,” is now a common text in law school curriculums, and is credited with developing the Critical Race Theory—a theory that argues white people will not help black people improve their position until given incentive.
Bell’s accomplishments in academia and activism took root before his career at Harvard began. Bell was born Nov. 6, 1930 in Pittsburgh, and was the first in his family to attend college, earning a degree from Duquesne University. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Bell went to work for the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department, resigning after being asked to rescind his membership in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Bell was then hired by the NAACP, working with Thurgood Marshall to develop a legal strategy to fight school segregation in the South.
Bell joined the Harvard faculty in 1969, receiving tenure two years later. He taught intermittently for more than two decades, leaving for a period in the 1980s to head the University of Oregan’s law school—becoming the first black dean of a law school that was not historically black.
Described as soft spoken and articulate by former student and longtime friend Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr., Bell protested against the Law School administration several times during his tenure. He once staged a five-day sit-in at his office to protest the Law School’s refusal to grant tenure to two controversial professors.
Ogletree remembered Bell as “a prolific, compassionate, and compelling scholar and activist” who was ahead of his time. Ogletree said that while student protests were fairly common, a faculty member protesting against the administration is something not often seen at HLS.
“He was unique in making a personal sacrifice on the issue of diversity,” Ogletree said of Bell’s 1990 resignation.
Since Bell’s resignation, Ogletree said, the Law School has improved the diversity of its faculty—granting the first black female professor, Lani Guinier ’71, tenure in 1998—but Ogletree said there is still room for improvement.
In his final address before leaving Harvard, Bell emphasized the importance of standing by one’s convictions.
“Your faith in what you believe must be a living, working faith that draws you away from comfort and security, and toward risk through confrontation,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Enticed by the growing energy surrounding the Occupy Boston protests, some Harvard students are starting to join in.
Occupy Boston, a protest movement that began Saturday, is primarily posted in Dewey Square across the street from South Station in Boston, where a tent city has emerged for protesters to stay overnight.
Hundreds of protesters have been camped out in Dewey Square—in the heart of Boston’s financial district—attempting to send a message to large corporations and political leaders regarding their disdain for the current state of politics and the economy.
Initially, many skeptics said the protesters lacked a clear message, leadership, or goals.
Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, described her own feelings about the movement when it first emerged last week as cautious. “I don’t know if I would have felt comfortable coming to Occupy Boston,” Korn said.
But students who were once uncomfortable supporting the movement are now showing interest, partially as a result of the recent legitimacy afforded to Occupy Boston by large-scale union support.
On Wednesday the Service Employees International Union, with more than 150 local unions and over 2.1 million affiliated employees, endorsed the protests.
“Now I feel it’s really important, and the movement has gained a lot of motion and legitimacy,” said Korn, a Crimson editorial board member.
Student support for Occupy Boston has gradually increased since the occupation first began last Saturday. A group of more than 20 Harvard students joined the protest Thursday. Students from Northeastern University and Emerson College, among others, have become active members of the movement.
“It’s part of a movement that’s going in a direction I really believe in and I’m really excited about. I’m very anti-corporation and pro-people’s rights,” Reed E. McConnell ’15 said. “It felt like the perfect way to respond to our anger.”
Although the Occupy Boston campaign does not currently have clear leadership, protesters for the most part say they are rallying around common anger towards corporate greed, growing economic inequalities, and the influence of special interests in politics.
At an Occupy Boston general assembly meeting in Dewey Square—organized by overnight demonstrators to deliberate on the intended message of the manifestation—participants spoke at length about allowing corporations such electoral finance liberties.
“Corporations are not people,” shouted one onlooker.
Last year, the Supreme Court passed the controversial Citizens United decision, which said that corporations should be treated like citizens under campaign finance laws. The 5-4 decision has drawn heavy criticism from the left.
The campaign, despite its seeming lack of centralized leadership, is moving to expand its influence through social media—creating a live blog to spread word about the protest and reaching out to college groups through email and twitter.
“It’s not just a bunch of people who are out there for a couple of nights protesting and then leaving. These people aren’t leaving,” Korn said. “It’s important for Harvard students to get involved and I’m excited.”
Occupy Boston drew inspiration from the Occupy Wall Street protests that began in New York City in mid-September.
“I had some friends who were in Occupy Wall Street in New York, and they got mace in the face. That actually ended up on video,” McConnell said. “They were arrested, they were put in handcuffs for three hours, detained for three hours. It was bad  ... I was so angry about it, and then Occupy Boston began.”
So far, the protests in Boston have been less boisterous than the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City, where on a single day over 700 protesters were arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge.

Men applying to jobs in the Midwest and the South who give evidence of being gay on their resumes are less likely to be called back for an interview than men perceived as displaying heterosexual qualities, according to a study published by a Harvard researcher this week.
The study found that, on average, men perceived as gay had to apply to 14 jobs to get called back for an interview. Men perceived as straight had to apply to fewer than nine jobs to receive a call back.
András Tilcsik ’05, who conducted the study and is a joint Ph.D candidate at Harvard Business School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, sent pairs of mock resumés to 1,769 job openings in seven states and compared the responses in order to gauge employer bias. To signal the applicant’s homosexual orientation, one of the fictitious resumes listed treasurer of a LGBT campus group as a past leadership position. The other fake applicant listed participation in a liberal campus organization to control for political discrimination while not including any groups that might indicate that the candidate was gay.
On average, the men perceived as being gay were called back for an interview 7.2 percent of the time, while men perceived as straight were called back for interviews 11.5 percent of the time.
Tilcsik wrote in an email that his findings differed significantly among geographic regions in the United States. In the western and northeastern states—California, Nevada, New York, and Pennsylvania—Tilcsik found a very small gap in the callback rates. But in the southern and midwestern states—Florida, Ohio, and Texas—there was a much larger gap in the callback rate for the two resumes.
Co-president of the  Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, Sam J. Bakkila ’11-’12, wrote in an email that the findings of Tilcsik’s study did not surprise him.
Bakkila wrote that, a senior applying for jobs, he personally must consider whether or not to include his position as the leader of a LGBTQ organization on campus in his resumé.
Bakkila wrote that he thinks the regional differences in hiring practices are especially important for Harvard students to consider. “This is very important for us all to remember because it is easy to feel, on a liberal college campus in the Northeast, that the battle for LGBT equality has already been won,” Bakkila wrote.
Tilcsik’s article represents the first major study of its kind to examine discrimination against gay men in the workplace without its participants being aware that a study was being carried out. It was published Tuesday in the American Journal of Sociology.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The death of Steve Jobs on Wednesday shook Apple, its devoted customer base, and aspiring entrepreneurs. But as the world reflects on Jobs’ legacy, one Harvard professor says that remembering the iconic genius primarily as an innovator would be a mistake.
“I don’t think what Jobs did was so much innovation,” said computer science professor of practice James H. Waldo, explaining that many of Apple’s products—from the first Macintosh user interface to the iPod and iPhone—simply expanded concepts that already existed.
Instead, Waldo said, Jobs revolutionized technology by making it beautiful—and trusting the consumer to pay for that aesthetic.
“He had a deep-seated sense of design. [He] took things that others had done and made them far more elegant and more beautifully realized,” Waldo said. “People have talked about that as innovation, but really what it is, is a sense of art and craftsmanship.”
Other professors agreed that calling Jobs’ vision “art” is not an overstatement.
“He was one of the first people, in my opinion, that basically included design and his aesthetics in the thinking of technology,” said Visual and Environmental Studies Lecturer Allen Sayegh.
Today, slim white earbuds are ubiquitous in fitness rooms and on buses. MacBook screens glow from every other seat in the average Harvard lecture hall. Apple permeates the culture of any community with access to computers, but at one point, Sayegh said, even Jobs’ choice for the company name was a novel and bold move.
“Everybody was naming their products product numbers,” he said. “[‘Apple’ was] counter-intuitive at that point.”
But Jobs’ faith in his personal vision was one of his keys to success, according to Neal Doyle, coordinator of the new Harvard Innovation Lab.
“He was uncompromising in his mission, he had absolute certainty in his project, and an eternal drive and optimism for seeking the best,” Doyle said.
Since Jobs returned to the company in 1997, Apple has unleashed a continuous barrage of products that have changed the way people use computers, talk on the phone, and buy and listen to music.
“He’s one of the best public speakers ever,” Doyle said. “It was him selling the product as much as the product that made you compelled to buy it.”
This “consumerization” of computer technology is Jobs’ greatest legacy, according to Eddie Kohler, associate professor of computer science.
But Founding Director of the Harvard Initiative in Innovative Computing Alyssa A. Goodman said the pace Jobs set for frequent technology updates raises concerns about the longevity of information on computers—and necessitates the creation of new ways to preserve information.
“I don’t want to blame him for the culture that doesn’t care about it, but the extremely rapid pace of innovation—it’s sort of like politics. No one thinks about the long term,” she said. “It’s unpopular in Silicon Valley to talk about long-term longevity. His influence was to create more and more of this culture who wants to do the next great thing tomorrow.”
Members of that Silicon Valley culture are currently mourning the loss of a beloved leader in the way they know best—Goodman said her Twitter feed had been flooded with commemorations of Jobs’ life.
“It’s like a god died,” Goodman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking for an exciting way to spend your long weekend?
Why not support three of your Harvard sports teams as they take on Cornell?  Crimson football, men’s soccer and women’s soccer are all making the trip to Ithaca, N.Y. this weekend to play the Big Red on its home turf. Yes, we know that six hours by car is a long way to go, so here is some motivation:
Five things Cornell has to offer…
1. Cornell is finally ranked #1…
Don’t worry, they haven’t overtaken us in the U.S. News and World Report rankings.  And we aren’t talking about athletics, either.  This is something quite different. The new book, The Rogers & Littleton Guide to America's Douchiest Colleges, has placed Cornell in its cherished, number-one spot!
2. The Souvlaki House
The Souvlaki House has probably the best lamb Souklavi and Greek salad you will ever have, right off campus in Cornell’s college town.  The trip is worth it for this food alone.
3. Ithaca is Gorges
The gorges may have gotten a lot of negative press lately, but they really are a sight to be seen!
4. Get ‘em while it’s hot!
If you are going to go, go now!  It will get really cold, really fast.  Winter from October to May, as they say?
5. Ok, so I could only think of four reasons to trek to Cornell…But see you in Ithaca?

After starting conference play with two straight wins, the Harvard women’s soccer team (7-4, 2-0 Ivy) will travel to Ithaca tomorrow in hopes of snatching another victory, this time from seventh-place Cornell (2-9, 0-2).
If history is any indicator, the Crimson should have an easier time coming up with the win on Saturday than it did against its two previous Ivy foes this season: defending champion Penn and Yale. Harvard has prevailed over the Big Red in every matchup since 2000, including last year’s 2-0 victory.
“We definitely try to treat every game as the most important game we’ll ever play—it’s a really good strategy,” freshman defender Lauren Urke said. “Obviously, there is a little more weight to Ivy games because everyone wants to win an Ivy title, but they are all important for our team development.”
The Crimson comes into the contest fresh off a 2-1 win against Fairfield on Tuesday, but the victory didn’t come easily. In its last two games against the Stags and the Bulldogs Harvard got off to a sluggish start before picking up its winning tallies after halftime.
In order to come out on top this weekend, the Crimson is keen on keeping Cornell as far away from the box as possible and finding its offensive rhythm early in the game.
An important factor for Harvard’s success will also be the consistent play of its youth. Eleven games into the season, the rookies have easily adapted to the Harvard system and are starting to flourish. Against Fairfield, freshman Meg Cascells-Hamby scored her fourth goal of the season and was an active playmaker in the midfield. Urke has also featured for the Crimson, playing as a right defender but also moving up the field and participating in the team’s offense.
“I think we are getting in a groove,” junior midfielder Aisha Price said. “The freshmen are a very talented class, and [they] bring a lot to the team.”
In the race for the Ivy championship, Harvard is currently tied for the top spot in the standings with Columbia, but a win this weekend could create some separation between the two Ivy rivals.
The Lions will play Penn, who rebounded from its loss against the Crimson with a win over Cornell last weekend.
The Big Red did not go down easily in that matchup in Philadelphia. Despite the Quakers’ early score in the second period, Cornell responded with the equalizer eight minutes later, only to see its comeback attempt fall short after Penn’s Marin McDermott deftly placed a header past the Big Red goalkeeper with 15 minutes remaining.
“Cornell brings a lot of energy to the table, and they’re a good team,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “They have demonstrated that in their first games of the Ivy League, by taking people to the end in tough games.”
A deciding factor in this weekend’s contest could be Cornell’s Charles F. Berman Field, which features grass as opposed to the turf with which the Crimson is more familiar. Harvard has taken note of this difference, and in its preparation, the squad played the Stags at Ohiri Field—a grass pitch—last week.
Defense will also be a key aspect of the game. In order to ensure a positive result, the Crimson has focused this past week on its defensive scheme.
“We are working on the thing we believe needs improvement,” Leone said. “We definitely want to try to defend a lot better than we did in the last two games.”
Harvard’s back line may have its hands full tomorrow. Junior forward Maneesha Chitanvis, the Big Red’s leading scorer in 2010, will be a threat to keep an eye on.
Chitanvis has scored four goals this season, already just one shy of her total last year. She also leads the team with nine points.
The Crimson defense has remained composed in its past four games, allowing only three goals. The offense has complemented the hardworking back line very nicely, outscoring its opponents by seven goals and sparking the team’s current four-game winning streak.
“Each game and team presents a different challenge for us,” Leone said. “I think the [team] is coming together, and the freshmen are working hard, and that’s something we expect but also appreciate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team will face quite the challenge this weekend as it enters its second Ivy League matchup of the season against Ancient Eight foe Cornell.
Historically known as a tough-to-reach opponent in upstate New York, the Big Red has been an even tougher squad to score on this season. In its last six games, Cornell (5-1-3, 1-0-0 Ivy) has allowed only one goal.
While Harvard (2-6-1, 0-1-0) has struggled of late, coming off of back-to-back one-goal losses against Yale and Boston University, the Crimson sees a great opportunity to emerge with a win in this weekend’s matchup.
“Last weekend against Yale, we had a slow start and this week we’ve been working a lot in practice to make sure that doesn’t happen,” junior forward Brian Rogers said. “We’re really tuned into this game.”
Rogers has been leading the attack for the Crimson with two goals, while fellow juniors Scott Prozeller and Zack Wolfenzon have also tallied a goal apiece this season.
In preparation for Saturday’s matchup, Harvard has spent the week scouting the  ins and outs of the Big Red’s defense, and is ready to break through Cornell’s recently impenetrable line.
“The coaching staff has done a great job scouting Cornell, figuring out how to break down its defense,” Rogers said.
The Crimson is focusing its efforts on executing set plays. This season, Harvard has been on the wrong end of a 46-27 corner-kick disadvantage.
Cornell has dominated on its opponents end of the field, crossing an astounding 61 corners, compared to its opponent’s 32.
This week, the Crimson has been working in practice to remedy the issue.
“The last few days at practice, we’ve been focusing a lot on corners,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “They have a couple of really big, athletic guys, so it’s something that we know we’ll have to deal with. We’re going to try to avoid giving up as many throws in our half and corners as possible, since we know that’s where they’re going to be most dangerous on the attack.”
This season, the Big Red has been notoriously dangerous on its long throw-ins.
Cornell has combined these throws with its corners to create a strong aerial attack.
“Like every Ivy League game, [the key is] set pieces, which are always a big battle,” Rogers said. “That’s how we conceded the Yale game, on the long throw. Cornell has a long throw and they’re really dangerous on set pieces, so I think it will be key for us to stay tuned-in for the whole game and not have any mental lapses where we lose our markers and give up another set-piece goal.”
Two markers that the Crimson can’t afford to lose are Cornell forward Daniel Haber and 6’5” defenseman Patrick Slogic. The sophomore duo has combined for six goals and five assists this year.
Down the stretch, these two have been particularly effective at finding ways to get open, combining for three game-winning goals.
“To deal with those players, we’ll put a guy on them, and it’s his responsibility to block his runs and make things as difficult as possible,” Linden said. “It really comes down to each man being personally responsible for his mark.”
In the nine games that Harvard has played this season, its defense has consistently stymied its opponent, allowing an average of only one goal per game. Harvard keepers Austin Harms and Brett Conrad have registered a combined three shutouts thus far.
Harms (18 career shutouts) will be looking to make history this weekend, as he is one clean sheet shy of tying Chris Johnson ’06 for the school shutout record. In the last five seasons, Harvard has yet to drop a game to the Big Red. On Saturday, the Crimson will look to continue that streak on the road as Harms chases history and Harvard tries to topple the Ivy League leader.
After all, the only way to shorten the trip home from Ithaca is with a win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before covering last week’s Harvard football game at Lafayette, I made the very fortunate decision to spend the night in New York City rather than in Easton, Pa.
About 45 minutes before last Saturday’s game, we asked where we could get a bite in town. The locals were very friendly to their Harvard visitors, but after a solid 30 seconds of thinking and conferring between the three people running the student give-away table, they couldn’t really think of any place for us to go.
New York has two world-class delis, a farmer’s market, and an oyster bar all in a two-block stretch. It was an easy decision.
After watching the Crimson give Lafayette a good-ol’-fashioned beatdown, I returned to the city to spend the night at the apartment of a few friends. I had a lot of fun—watched a movie (ever seen Trainspotting? Never, ever watch it), played Risk, and hung out. Pretty wholesome, sure, but very enjoyable. I thought it was a solid way to spend the evening.
The next morning, before heading back to Cambridge, I got breakfast at 7:45 with my cousin, who just by chance was visiting New York from St. Louis for his friend’s 25th birthday.
My “fun” got blown out of the water. This 25-year-old friend of his just sold a company for some ungodly sum of money, so it wasn’t just a regular birthday party. After spending a brunch spraying champagne on various models, my cousin told me he partied later that night with Miss Holland or some other pageant winner from the European realm, finally getting to sleep around 5 a.m.
How he managed to drag himself out of bed to meet me for breakfast was nothing short of a miracle. But he did, and we were able to share our tales of the night.
What I learned from our meal at Le Pain—an appropriate name for a breakfast joint at that hour—was that there’s fun, and then there’s fun. Not the same thing.
Likewise, in Ivy League football, there are wins. And then there are wins.
Both Harvard and Cornell crushed its competition last week. But just because they add a tally to their win totals does not mean the wins are equal in any way outside the standings.
The Big Red beat Wagner, 31-7, but its opponent had already lost its last two games to mediocre teams. Lafayette, while up-and-down, beat Penn earlier in the year, so the Crimson’s dominant 31-3 victory makes a statement.
The game of the week was clearly the showdown between the Big Green and the Quakers in Dartmouth’s first-ever night game. The Big Green narrowly lost, giving-up a last-second touchdown that prevented the Ivy’s first major upset.
Yale also picked up a loss, its first of the year. But the Bulldogs were blown out by Lehigh, 37-7.
Point is, don’t read too much into the win-loss column just yet. It can be misleading.
DARTMOUTH (1-2, 0-1 Ivy) at YALE (2-1, 1-0)
After a pounding at the hands of the Mountain Hawks last week, Yale returns to New Haven to face off against Dartmouth.
Last Saturday, the Bulldogs were hardly ever in the game. Yale pulled within three early in the second quarter, but the team was held scoreless for the rest of the game. Bulldogs quarterback Patrick Witt was subpar, completing just 12 of 31 passes with two interceptions.
Coming off its loss to Penn, Dartmouth looks like a much better team. Big Green running back Nick Schwieger—defender of and contender for the Ivy League MVP award—ran for 130 yards and scored the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter to nearly give Dartmouth the win.
Against Yale, Lehigh didn’t rely much on its run game. And you don’t have to when your quarterback goes 34-for-46 in completions.
I think Witt will definitely pick up his game after a poor effort last week. This is yet another big test for the Big Green—it’s a must-win if it wants to hold onto any shot at the title.
And with its last two losses coming in the final 60 seconds, I think karma finally goes Dartmouth’s way.
Pick: Dartmouth 28, Yale 24
HOLY CROSS (2-2, 1-0 Patriot) at BROWN (2-1, 0-1 Ivy)
As Harvard knows first-hand, Holy Cross is much better this year than it has been in the past. The team may have had an easier time in its win over the Crimson than it should have because of Harvard’s costly miscues, but there’s no question that the Crusaders are a talented group.
But so are the Bears. After a sloppy week-two performance against the Crimson, Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero put together a much better game last week against Rhode Island, completing 17 of 29 passes and throwing for 203 yards and two touchdowns.
Holy Cross is coming off its second loss of the year, but its defeat at the hands of a strong New Hampshire team came on a 60-yard touchdown pass with about a minute left.
The Crusader secondary was clearly off last week—the team surrendered three touchdown passes of 25 yards or more—and still managed to keep the game knotted into the final stages of the game. I think Holy Cross will find a way to fix its defensive holes well enough to shut down Newhall-Caballero’s offense.
Pick: Holy Cross 34, Brown 21
SACRED HEART (2-2, 1-1 NEC) at COLUMBIA (0-3, 0-1 Ivy)
You know when you can tell a team is bad? When it loses to Princeton.
Sorry, Columbia. You just handed the Tigers their first Ivy League win this decade. And I’m having a hard time taking you seriously after that.
Sacred Heart, on the other hand, is riding a two-game win streak, including a last-minute victory over the Big Green two weeks ago.
I don’t see this one being close. But you never know—it’s a crazy world out there.
Pick: Sacred Heart 31, Columbia 10
PRINCETON (1-2, 1-0 Ivy) at HAMPTON (2-2, 0-1 MEAC)
Sorry, Princeton. I know you just won your first game in a while, but you’re still Princeton.
Quarterback Tommy Wornham had a solid game for the Tigers last week, throwing 19 passes and throwing for 194 yards and two touchdowns. But I still don’t think it’ll be enough. Even though Hampton has lost its last two, the Pirates have still scored 42 and 31 points, respectively, in those games. Two Princeton wins in a row might be too much to ask for.
Pick: Hampton 35, Princeton 17
FORDHAM (1-3, 0-1 Patriot) at PENN (1-2, 1-0 Ivy)
Penn is not the dominant Ivy League force that everyone expected them to be. After two resounding defeats to start the year, the Quakers could just as easily be 0-3 right now were it not for its impressive last-second comeback in Hanover, N.H. last week.
Still, Fordham isn’t exactly the powerhouse of the Patriot League. The Rams’ only win was a one-touchdown victory over Columbia, and it got blown out last week in a game against Colgate.
Fordham was especially susceptible to the run, surrendering 347 yards on the ground. Penn’s strength is in the air, but both quarterback Billy Ragone and running back Brandon Colavita are threats to take off.
Pick: Penn 28, Fordham 20
HARVARD (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) at CORNELL (2-1, 0-1 Ivy)
In every single game this season, Harvard’s defense has gotten better, culminating in last week’s shutdown of Lafayette.
And even without starting quarterback Collier Winters—backup Colton Chapple will start his third game in a row—the offense has been running smoothly. Three games into the year, Harvard looks like it might be the strongest team in the league.
But don’t count out Cornell. Quarterback Jeff Matthews is one of the best in the league, and he’s just a sophomore. This isn’t the Big Red squad of 2010—while the team might not be a title contender yet, it’s certainly more of a threat than it was a year ago.
The way Harvard has been playing of late, it looks like it could be hard to stop. And with the Crimson having lost to Cornell just once since 2001, I’ll side with history.
Pick: Harvard 27, Cornell 16
RECORD LAST WEEK: 4-2

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s doubles partners and junior co-captains Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana used their western grip yesterday at the Riviera/ITA All-American Tennis Championships to upset No. 12-ranked Lauren Embree and Joanna Mather of Florida in the first round of the main draw doubles, 8-4.
The tournament, located in Pacific Palisades, Calif., attracts the top Division I athletes throughout the United States. Players are selected via the ITA preseason national rankings, in which junior-co-captains rank as the No. 1 doubles team in the Northeast region.
Last year at the Riviera/ITA All-American Championships, the Crimson duo competed in the lower, pre-qualifying draw, producing the same 8-4 victory against the University of Texas in the first round before falling to USC’s Valeria Pulido and Alison Ramos, 8-5, in the second.
With their win this year, Norton and Tachibana continue on to face the reigning champions of the main draw, Josipa Bek and Keri Wong from Clemson. The Tiger tandem is the top-ranked doubles team in the nation after an impressive 34-11 record last season.
The Crimson and Clemson will rally today beginning at 9:00 a.m. PST.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There will be many fasting around the world tomorrow afternoon, but the Harvard football team is ready to feast.
The Crimson (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) travels to Ithaca, N.Y., to take on Cornell (2-1, 0-1) in a contest in which Harvard will look to continue a dominant two-game stretch while the Big Red will attempt to prove it is no longer the league bottom-feeder it was a year ago, when it lost to the Crimson in Cambridge, 31-17.
Cornell has already picked up two victories in non-conference play this season—a 24-13 defeat of Bucknell and a 31-7 victory last weekend over Wagner—which means it has already equaled its 2010 total win total.
Harvard, meanwhile, is coming off two big victories of its own, a 24-7 win over Brown on Sept. 24, followed by a 31-3 thrashing of Lafayette last weekend.
With senior starting quarterback Collier Winters missing those games with injury, the Crimson defense has stepped it up in its two wins, forcing eight turnovers and collecting eight sacks.
“[The defense’s] practices have been going really well,” explained senior cornerback Matthew Hanson. “Our guys have put in extra time on watching film.”
The dominant defensive play has made life easier for junior quarterback Colton Chapple, who has filled in admirably for Winters, throwing for 328 yards, three touchdowns, and just one interception in two starts.
The junior left last weekend’s game against the Leopards at halftime with back stiffness and did not return, but Murphy said the quarterback is ready to go this week.
Last season, Chapple got the start against the Big Red, leading Harvard to the win despite completing under 50 percent of his passes and throwing two interceptions. But this year, Murphy has seen a growth that has allowed the coach to be more comfortable with the junior under center.
“Colton’s clearly made the transition from having to be very one-dimensional last year while he got his feet wet,” Murphy said. “Now he’s not only had a lot of reps, but he’s 5-1 as a starter ... We now have a guy that knows the offense, that’s confident, he’s a guy that can execute all the passes of our offense.”
Chapple was able to win last season largely due to help from his running game, as the Crimson ran for 314 yards on just 45 carries for a whopping 7.0 yards per rush. Junior running back Treavor Scales gained 93 yards in that contest on just 11 attempts.
But with a more experienced Chapple under center, Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he doesn’t plan to rely as heavily on his ground game this time around.
“We need to be a balanced offense to beat this team,” Murphy said. “I think that’s the key.”
For Harvard has noticed on film that its opponent has greatly improved since the Crimson’s big win a year ago.
After an up-and-down rookie season that saw him complete just 55 percent of his passes, Big Red quarterback Jeff Matthews has upped his completion percentage to 66 percent in his second season. The sophomore also leads the league in passing yards with 800 as well as in passing efficiency.
On the other end of many of those throws has been junior wide receiver Kurt Ondash, who paces the conference with 15 receptions and 271 yards thus far. The receiver will pose this season’s toughest test yet for Hanson, a four-year starter at corner for the Crimson and one of the conference’s best defensive backs.
“Ondash is a really good receiver,” Hanson said. “I’ve been watching him on film a lot; he does a lot of things really well. I think I have a good read on him but we’ll see how it goes ... I’m going to be really aggressive come Saturday.”
After having the worst statistical offense in the league last season, Cornell is first in total offense behind Matthews and Ondash in 2010.
“Overall their offense is a lot better than last year,” Hanson said. “Their offensive line has really improved ... Jeff Matthews, watching him on film, he has a really strong arm, so he’s a dangerous weapon all around.”
The Big Red defense has also made strides since last season, when it was seventh in total defense. This year, Cornell ranks second in that category, as well as in scoring defense.
Senior linebacker Brandon Lainhart is tied for fifth in the Ancient Eight with 27 tackles, two behind Harvard’s leader, captain Alex Gedeon.
Cornell senior defensive end Zack Imhoff leads the Ivies with four sacks, and sophomore linebacker Brett Buehler paces the conference with six tackles for loss. That means Harvard’s young offensive line will have its hands full protecting Chapple.
If the quarterback is able to respond to the pressure—both literally and figuratively—and lead his team to a win, he will be continuing a stretch in which Harvard has largely dominated Cornell on the gridiron.
Harvard has lost to the Big Red just once in the past 11 years—a 27-13 defeat in 2005 —and has averaged 32 points per game in its five games since.
It’s a streak the Crimson has been working hard to ensure will continue tomorrow.
“Our preparation has been really good lately,” Hanson said. “We’re going to come out ready to go.”
