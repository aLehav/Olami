After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, NY—It was an event I anticipated for one day shy of a month: Al Yeganeh, the man who inspired the Soup Nazi character, was reopening his original location in New York, and I wanted to go.
Being a Seinfeld fan to the bone, when word got around that the shop made famous in one of the most well-known episodes was reopening, I was psyched. In the episode, a hot-tempered man called the Soup Nazi makes some of the best soup in Manhattan, but imposes a strict set of regulations on his customers. Patrons must approach the counter, state their order, move to the left, take their soup, and leave. Violations will result in the Soup Nazi snatching away the soup and delivering his admonishing catchphrase: “No soup for you!”
The night before and the morning of July 20, I mentally prepared myself for the feat. Did I have exact change? Yes, I had 11 one-dollar bills, which would be more than enough. Did I want bread? Only if he gave me bread. Was I going to dilly-dally, tap my fingers against the glass, and try to make small talk? No, no, and no.
When a friend and I arrived at The Original SoupMan, only five people were waiting in front of the modest soup counter with pots and ingredients laid bare for on-lookers. To the right was the menu of soups. Above the counter, signs with three simple rules in many different languages ordered customers to have their money ready and move to the left of the counter after ordering their soup. To help them move to the left, the sidewalk had white footsteps guiding customers along that path.
But no one really did move to the left, largely because no one made them. The cashier was a college-aged woman who seemed too gentle to yank away the soup if a customer breaks a rule. The man who appeared to be in charge raised his voice only twice: once to announce they only had chicken vegetable, turkey chili, and mulligatawny, and again to state that they had run out of one-dollar bills and required exact change.
What the staff may have lacked in intensity was compensated by the soup. I ordered a cup of mulligatawny—the soup Elaine was denied when she told the Soup Nazi that he resembled Al Pacino. It was absolutely delicious, thick, rich in flavor, and served with a piece of bread, an apple, and a Lindt chocolate truffle. My friend gave similarly rave reviews for her cup of chicken vegetable soup.
Since it was the first day, they even gave us free t-shirts, a kind gesture that defied the cruel reputation the establishment had among those only familiar with the TV show. Ironically, it actually would have been nice if they were meaner—or, at least as my friend put it, more brusque—as that would have accorded with my conception of the restaurant, but in Yeganeh’s attempts to shed the Nazi moniker he rightfully abhors, the commonness of the treatment was able to give way to the exceptionality of what really mattered—the soup.

ARUSHA, Tanzania—The Maasai woman shoved three beaded bracelets in my face, “sister, look at my bracelets. Good price, good price.” When she saw me looking at her instead of at the jewelry, at her red cloak, shaved head and brightly colored hoop necklace, she changed her pitch. “1000 for a bracelet and a picture, sister, 1000. Take a picture with me.”
The Maasai are a Tanzanian tribe noted for their steadfast adherence to their traditions. Men are easily identified by the purple and red cloaked attire and their wooden walking sticks; the women often also wear cloaks, have bare heads and wear dangly beaded-and-spangled earrings from a piercing at the top of their ear. Most still live in simple huts or houses and herd cattle for a living. Many Maasai choose this low-cost lifestyle consciously, not because of a lack of money. Upon seeing a teenaged Maasai drive an average-sized herd of around 20 cattle across a rural highway, I asked a local friend how much one of the cows was worth. He estimated 400,000 Shillings, or $266; the average annual income in Tanzania is $564. When I visited a top gynecological clinic in Arusha, over half the clientele were Maasai women.
The contrast between the Maasai’s wealth and lifestyle has made them a locus for outside attention. A majority of tourist paintings, postcards, and other souvenirs feature images of Maasai, even though they make up only 1.3 percent of the national population. One could argue that all this external attention is excessive at best and patronizing at worst. Of course “wazungu,” as foreigners are called here, would be obsessed with a Tanzanian ethnic group that fits their superficial stereotype of the backward, tribal African. When I first came here I felt bad that the Maasai were subject to such insidious curiosity about why they chose to live in a decidedly “unmodern” way.
However, rather than make efforts to nuance foreigners’ views, the Maasai seem to encourage simplification. The jewelry-selling woman was the first of many Maasai to approach me offering a picture for money. In fact, if you point a camera vaguely in the direction of a Maasai on the Northern safari circuit they are sure to reach out their hand and ask for a tip—even the young children. Additionally, nearly every hostel and tourist office has a brochure advertising “Maasai Camp.” For around $100 a day you can, “sleep in a traditional dwelling!” “participate in a traditional ceremony!” and “get your perfect picture!” To me, it would be as if I asked for five bucks every time a tourist snapped a picture of me hurrying to class in the Science Center, or if we Harvard students organized exorbitantly expensive tours of our habitat—“sleep in Lamont!” “participate in a problem-set session!” “get a picture with a dean!”
In marketing themselves as nothing more than a stereotype, the Maasai are setting back efforts to make foreigners understand that the way of life here is so much more than what gets shown on National Geographic. Each tourist that comes to Tanzania is an opportunity to expand conceptions of who Africans are, but if they are spoon-fed back their preconceived notions they will never see the difference between product and person.

BLERANCOURT, France—The countryside of Picardy is dotted with poppies. They grow on the edges of the wheat, sugar beet and potato fields, under the fences of cow pastures, and on the shoulders of the “autoroutes”. When I first arrived in Blérancourt, I was constantly reminded of the scene in “The Wizard of Oz,” in which Dorothy and company attempt to cross a field of the red flowers and, succumbing to their deadly influence, fall into a drug-induced sleep.
Of course, the flowers that I walk by on a daily basis don't have quite the same effect. When I told my French roommate of the association I had with the poppies, she laughed and told me that the wildflowers were so commonplace that she rarely took the time to think about them.
Poppies do, however, hold symbolic meaning for the people of the region. Here called “coquelicots,” they stand for the fallen soldiers of WWI. The flowers are hardly the only mark of the Great War on the landscape; graveyards of French, English, and American soldiers are almost as common as the wildflowers, and even the smallest village has some kind of monument dedicated “à nos morts.” In the nearby town of Coucy-le-Chateau-Auffrique, the abandoned remains of some kind of World War I German weaponry were until recently hidden in the undergrowth of a forest that has sprouted up over the last century.
Though I personally associate the flowers much more strongly with a scene from my favorite childhood movie, they are in fact a frequent feature of Veteran's Day in the United States and of other Remembrance Days around the world. WWI poet John McCrae famously wrote, “In Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses, row on row.” Somewhat more recently the flowers appeared in a Captain Beefheart song: “It don't get me high / It can only make me cry / Your Veteran's Day poppy.”
It was not until I was living here, though, that I registered the darker associations of the brightly colored flowers. I have often heard people remark, after traveling in Europe, that there is a greater sense of history here, and that in the United States the marks of our country's comparatively short history are often too easily erased. But I have found these wild memorials of the fields of war to be much more powerful than any of the manually built ones. Here, the poppies blossom annually as reminders of the blood lost in these very same fields. But even as they stand in memory of the anonymous dead, they are also markers of the regenerative nature of the land. Though it was once devastated by war, the countryside is now lushly green, save for the occasional field of red coquelicots.

PARIS, France—If you searched all the suitcases that arrive every morning at Charles de Gaulle Airport from American cities as far and wide as New York, Miami, and San Francisco, there is one item you would almost certainly find in each of them (besides jean shorts, that is).
For some reason, a huge percentage of American tourists in Paris seems to bring with them a copy of Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast—the classic memoir of Paris in the 1920s, when, naturally, Hemingway would write in cafes all afternoon, hobnob with other (wealthier) expatriates, and, perhaps less naturally, actually capture and kill real, live pigeons when he no longer had the money to dine out.
At first, this ostensibly literary obsession is charming, almost cute. So charming, in fact, that, for a while, fanny packs, white sneakers, and mom jeans all become somewhat tolerable—well, at least forgivable—when you see the same mullet-headed men and frumpy, sunburned women (whose behavior would otherwise impel you to feign an accent and pretend to be Canadian) happily en route to Hemingway’s first Paris apartment just off Place de la Contrescarpe or to the Café de la Paix, where he famously couldn’t afford his 1922 Christmas dinner.
“Hey,” you almost want to say to that section of French public opinion that insists America is a country that persecutes “intellectuals” like, say, Roman Polanski. “Looky here! My countrymen have come to Paris to retrace the footsteps of an artist who isn’t Jim Morrison! Suck on that!”
While almost no one would argue that the Lost Generation represents anything but a remarkable moment in the history of Americans abroad, I have to wonder about the need to traipse through the streets of what is perhaps the world’s most beautiful city in search of the various bars in which Hemingway once drank. (The answer: all of them! A more interesting question would be where that man didn’t drink.)
More importantly, however, I question the need to see Paris through someone else’s eyes, to search in vain for the Paris of the rosy past in order to avoid the inconvenient truths of the Paris of the present, whose cafes are no longer cheap and whose personality is hardly the same as that of the city in Hemingway’s memoir. A good traveler should make the effort to see a city as it is rather than as it once was, to forge his or her own impressions of a place instead of accepting at face value the recollections of a writer active long ago.
After all, Paris after Hemingway has been invaded in a World War, transformed—at least in terms of population demographics—by an influx of immigrants from former French colonies in North Africa, and rocked by the growing sense of unrest among those immigrants who, to say the very least, found the City of Light to be a bit less than welcoming after they arrived en masse.
That’s the Paris of the present, the Paris that any traveler has an obligation to see. And as eloquent a love letter as A Moveable Feast may be to the French capital, it alone is not enough to guide one through the city; it is no substitute for the Paris of the present or for one’s own impressions of that Paris, a bit seedier perhaps but, nevertheless, the real thing.
The other day I found in my apartment a copy of Bob and Roberta Smith’s classic Make Your Own Damn Art, which, as the title might suggest, urges readers to rage against the machine and create the art that moves them, based on the lives they themselves have lead.
Well, folks, the same seems true for Hemingway’s memoir and the City of Light: Make your own damn Paris!

PRINCETON, NJ—If you happen to pass by me at Princeton University this summer, you might notice that I am gazing a bit too intently at the sprawling dorms and the seemingly endless courtyards that run through this central New Jersey campus. You might assume that I am awed by the gorgeous Gothic architecture, or entranced by the subtle suburban charm.
But in fact, my dreamy state has nothing to do with a sense of wonder. Rather, since beginning my internship at a Princeton physics lab this summer, I have been envisioning my life as a student here. Two years after I nearly committed to Princeton, I have been contemplating the college years that might have been.
During the April of my senior year, I stepped onto the Princeton campus for prefrosh weekend and immediately “saw myself” as an undergrad. The university was a mere 45-minute drive from my house, and my high school was sending six other students to Princeton, several of whom were my good friends. The environment felt cozy and homelike, a perfect place to continue my education after a taxing senior year.
But ultimately, with less than a day left to make my decision, I caved to a combination of parental pressure and the sense that “you just can’t turn Harvard down.” I committed to Harvard almost bitterly, wondering if I was losing a chance to be truly happy.
When I chose to work at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab for the summer, I knew that my old uncertainties would reemerge. In my sole visit to Princeton since I declined enrollment, I had spent the whole evening interrogating myself about whether I had made the right choice. Would my internship wind up being ten weeks of the same terrible monologue?
When I first arrived, I thought it very well might. Walking the quarter mile between my dorm and Nassau Street, I was overwhelmed by the same emotions I’d felt two years prior: comfort and security, a sense of contentment.
But as my days at Princeton turned into weeks, I began to notice something odd about the feelings that the college engendered in me: Imagining myself as a Princeton student felt less like slipping into an alternate life than slipping into a prior one. The sensation I felt on campus was almost identical to the comfort I felt when I visited my high school or slept in my old bedroom during visits home from college.
And as I opened my eyes to my surroundings, I began to notice all the ways in which the town of Princeton is so much like my hometown–quaint, suburban, and full of commuters to New York City and Philadelphia. I began to see all the ways in which Princeton, a preppy New Jersey school, resembles the New Jersey prep school that I attended.
I came to realize that even though I was extremely lucky to have had the option, attending Princeton would’ve meant never really leaving home. And for the sheltered 18-year-old who I once was, that would have meant foregoing the growing pains associated with that rite of passage.
Because being five hours away from home, without a ready-made friend group, I have made serious mistakes and had no safety net to catch me. I have clumsily mismanaged some relationships and bungled others; I have struggled through academic and personal setbacks; and I have sometimes disappointed myself or failed to live up to my own expectations.
In an unfamiliar environment and sometimes unsure of where to turn, these experiences have tested my strength. But they have also forced me to become a more mature and independent person–and for that, I am deeply grateful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, NY—When I was five, I went with my family down to North Carolina to hang out with my grandparents and cousins. We went to the pool, and I learned how to do a flip off of the higher of the two diving boards. We drove to the mall to watch PG rated movies–more likely G rated. We cooked dinner; I have memories of green beans. Garden hoses and sprinklers and slides were involved in most afternoons.
Somewhere between now and then, the expectation for how I spend my summers has changed dramatically. The last few weeks of school are filled with the loaded question, “So what are you doing this summer?” or as some phrase it, “Where are you going to be this summer?”—the implication being that you will either find yourself in some far away land or at a company whose name and office real estate qualify it to be a “where.” The question is a great one for those who have exciting plans; it is an awkward one for whom plans have not yet panned out. But the expectation is that the askee and asker will be doing something, something of note, something that can be summarized in fewer than 10 words.
My answer circa May: “Traveling through Greece writing for a travel guide.” Seven words. My answer now that my glorious stint in Greece has ended: “Hanging out at home.” Four words. I think if those four words had been the ones I had uttered on campus, I would have gotten more than a few surprised looks. But it has been glorious.
For the past week, I have been blissfully without obligation. I have had time to bake my younger sister’s birthday cake, have lunch with my mom mid-work day, and travel to Westchester to see friends from high school. I have walked around Central Park, sat in the sun and read, and then slipped into a mid-afternoon nap before going for a run in the evening. I have not set an alarm in a week. I’ve been reading the newspaper–the hard copy that is delivered to my apartment–over breakfast. In a few days I am going down to North Carolina with my mom to, yes, see my cousins and grandparents there.
I'm not going to launch into a tirade against internships or travel. I have done both and know both to be fascinating and beneficial and fun, for all the obvious and innumerable reasons. But I do think the simple pleasures of summer—watermelon and time with grandparents, and perhaps most pronouncedly, lounge time—are underrated, or more likely, sacrificed. I will not proclaim this to be a Harvard problem, or a generational trend, or anything of the sort. I will simply say that I'm quite glad to have had my time in Greece, and now I am content to eat watermelon. If you have a second, the Kool-Aid is in the fridge.

DAYTONA BEACH, FL—“Look, Brittany, it’s Joey Logano!” I yell at my friend who is standing a mere two feet away. She gives me a patronizing glance as if to say, “Really?” and I try to take it down a few decibels. We’re at the NASCAR Sprint Cup driver and crew chief meeting that happens right before every race, the last place I ever expected to disturb the peace and here I am, causing a scene.
Joey Logano, of Joe Gibbs racing and the No. 20 Home Depot Toyota, is far and away my favorite driver. He’s young, has dashing good looks, and is an underdog fighting his way to victory.
A few months ago, the name Joey Logano would’ve meant very little to me because I, like many of my friends, had never followed NASCAR before, seen a race, or attended an event. Through the company’s Diversity Internship Program, I learned of an opening at the International Speedway Corporation, which runs 13 of the tracks where NASCAR races take place. I leapt at the opportunity to do something I knew I liked (marketing) and try something I had never experienced before (the need for speed).
Despite not knowing much about the industry, I brought with me certain preconceived notions—looming stereotypes about the fans being “rednecks.” I knew these were unfounded judgements, but nonetheless they existed in the back of my mind.
Orientation for the internship in Charlotte, North Carolina, along with a copy of NASCAR for Dummies, helped clear up some of my technical questions about the sport, but left me contemplating the ideological ones.
A few hours after the driver and crew chief meeting ended on race day, I settled into seats up in Weatherly Tower beside my mom and sister who had come down to visit for the weekend of the Coke Zero 400. It was the first NASCAR Sprint Cup race for all three of us, and we had a great time listening to the commentary, watching as the cars accelerated by in a blur and observing the legions of fans around us.
In this setting, any yelling I did was socially acceptable, encouraged even. Standing as the drivers rounded Turn 4 and feeling terrible when A.J. Allmendinger had to leave the race after his car wrecked, I discovered that somewhere between learning how to change a tire and navigating the expansive infield at Daytona International Speedway, I had become a proper race fan. I could go on and apply any previously held stereotypes to myself and when I did, I found that they didn’t exactly fit. There was no one way to categorize the NASCAR Nation besides by the intensity of competition, the dedication displayed by those involved.
The sport isn’t perfect, but it strives to reflect what people want from it. In a time of generational shifts among viewers, a faltering economy and prevailing misconceptions like the ones I harbored, it can be hard for this sanctioning body to reach out to someone whose never been exposed to racing before. However, in my case, when they did reach out, taking advantage of that chance provided an opportunity to rebel like the moonshine runners of NASCAR did so long ago, from an invisible prohibition that restricted exploration.
Misconceptions about its supporters were part of what made me wary of NASCAR, but the truth about them—the kindness and drive I witnessed—are what made me a fan.

The potential appointment of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren to head a new consumer agency in Washington has gained a broad base of support due to her academic credentials and her personal attachment to the project.
President Barack Obama signed last Wednesday the financial legislation that officially established the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, but he has not yet announced whether Warren will be named to run it.
As described in the recent legislation, the new agency will be responsible for regulating the provision of consumer financial products, conducting research on financial counseling and education, and handling consumer complaints. The director of the bureau would serve for five-year terms.
In a recent interview with ABC, Obama said that he was a student at Harvard while Warren, an expert of bankruptcy and commercial law, taught at the Law School and that he held the “highest regard” for her.
“Elizabeth Warren is a terrific candidate,” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at a news briefing, The New York Times reported. “I don’t think any criticism in any way by anybody would disqualify her and I think she’s very confirmable for this job.”
Warren, who joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1992, was named the 2009 Bostonian of the Year by The Boston Globe for bringing “a sense of sanity to the economic crisis.”
The Oklahoma native and former registered Republican was appointed chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel in 2008. In that government post, she defended the middle class and kept close watch on the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was created in October 2008 to stave off a potential collapse of the U.S. financial system.
Now, Warren finds herself contending for a position at the helm of the new bureau—which she has been advocating for since 2007, when she published an article calling for an agency that protects the consumers of financial products in the same way that the Consumer Product Safety Commission protects buyers of goods.
“It needs a leader who has a passion for protecting consumer interests—and who recognizes that doing so contributes to the health of the financial system,” The Globe wrote about the directorship of the new bureau. “Warren is easily the best candidate for the position.”
The other candidates include Eric Stein, a consumer protection official in the Treasury Department; Martha Coakley, the attorney general of Massachusetts; and Wharton School professor Susan M. Wachter.
Warren has received the endorsements of major papers like The Times and The Globe—as well as many of her colleagues over at the Law School, who expressed full confidence in Warren’s ability to run the new bureau.
“She is brilliant, hardworking, a consummate professional, and an outstanding teacher,” said I. Glenn Cohen, an assistant professor of law who also serves as co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.
Other colleagues also spoke in strong admiration of Warren’s “energetic” teaching style. During a typical class, she would call upon 20 or so students, challenging them as she moved quickly from one student to the next.
“You see that all the students are sitting at the edge of their seats,” said Jeannie Suk, assistant professor of law. “It’s a combination of excitement and fear...that she’s going to call on you.”
Assistant Law Professor D. James Greiner said that her style of constant questioning would be an apt trait for the government position.
“I think that’s what you want—somebody who’s constantly looking for facts,” Greiner said. “She’s an empirical investigator, trying to base decisions [on facts]. That’s what you want in a government official—that fact-driven, investigative mind.”
A New York Times editorial stated that bank lobbyists are saying that Warren would “overreact” in protecting consumers from abusive loans, but that her academic work shows that Warren understands the “power of credit to do good.”
“The banks don’t oppose Ms. Warren because she doesn’t get it,” the editorial stated. “They oppose her because she does.”
But the new agency has received a slew of criticism for its organization under the Federal Reserve. Those opposed to the legislation are dubious of its efficacy, arguing that the Federal Reserve does not protect consumers in the first place.
Moreover, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that he does not endorse Warren to run the agency due to her criticism of the Obama administration’s handling of Troubled Asset Relief Program.

UPDATED 10:03 a.m.
Hollman Morris Rincon, a Colombian journalist who was originally denied his student visa to the United States last month, officially received his visa Tuesday morning.
 
The Nieman Fellow for the class of 2010-2011 will be free to travel to the United States and study at the foundation for journalists, according to an announcement made by the Nieman Foundation.
 
Robert H. Giles, curator of the Foundation, said that he was delighted at the news when he received a phone call from Morris in Bogota this morning at about 11:15 a.m. The acclaimed human rights reporter and producer of an independent television news program had been denied a student visa by the Department of State on "security-related grounds."
 
“I think this is an aspiring example of a large community of individuals and organizations working to get the right thing done,” Giles told The Crimson in an interview Tuesday afternoon.
 
A reporter known for his critical coverage of Colombia President Álvaro Uribe Vélez’s administration, Morris developed connections with sources who did not support the outgoing president.
 
For the past few weeks, Giles worked with several journalism and human rights organizations to lobby for the investigative reporter.
 
The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, the Human Rights Watch, and the Committee to Protect Journalists are other organizations participating in the fight against the denial of Morris’ entry into the United States. Thirty-one faculty members at the University of Texas, Austin wrote a letter to Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg, and the Canadian Journalists for Free Expansion called for Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton to take action.
 
Nieman Fellows from the class of 1988 even showed their support for Morris by sending e-mails to Juan Manuel Santos, who recently won the presidency of Colombia in a landslide election and had previously served as the finance minister under Uribe. Santos was a 1988 Nieman Fellow and the sub-director of his family-owned newspaper El Tiempo, which has the largest circulation in the country.
“I’m delighted to hear that justice has been made, and the State Department corrected this absurd mistake,” said Rosental C. Alves, a Fellow in Santos’ Nieman class. He added that his own Nieman experience was a “watershed” in his life and career, as it will be for Morris—especially after he returns to his newsroom and his country after the year of study.
The Nieman Fellowship Program is a mid-career program for journalists on the domestic and international field. Each year, at least 12 U.S. and 12 international journalists are selected to attend the year-long program at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.

The good times keep rolling for former Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin.
Less than one week after signing a two-year contract with the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, Lin left for Taiwan to participate in Yao Ming’s annual charity game that will be held in the Taipei Arena tomorrow night.
Lin will join forces with fellow NBA players Dwight Howard, Brandon Jennings, Aaron Brooks, Chase Budinger, Hasheem Thabeet, DaJuan Summers, Amir Johnson, and Luke Babbitt against 14 players from the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association in the charity event.
The game will benefit the Yao Ming Foundation, established by Ming in 2008 to help build earthquake-resistant schools.
Lin—a Palo Alt, Calif., native whose parents immigrated from Taiwan—was contacted personally by Yao and asked to play in the event, according to Focus Taiwan News Channel.
“I was surprised and excited to receive the invitation,” Lin told the news channel.

As we understand it, you can't exactly stroll into any final club without being a member or guest. But Aaron Sorkin, the mastermind behind "The West Wing," "A Few Good Men," and now "The Social Network," got a lucky break.
Apparently, Sorkin was given a guided tour of Harvard's final clubs by Benjamin A. Mezrich '91—the author of "The Accidental Billionaires," on which the Facebook movie is based—while he was "researching" the screenplay for his movie.
As if you couldn't already tell by the trailer, which features multiple shots of beautiful women shimmying dreamily around suited men, the final club scene plays an important role in the film. "I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs," Facebook creator Mark E. Zuckerberg '07 says in the trailer. His female friend on the other side of the table (rightly) asks, "Why?" But really, Mark. Why? "Because they're exclusive. And fun. And lead to a better life."
Yep, there it is. For all you non-final club members out there, that's what you're missing out on. Anyway, we digress. Eduardo L. Saverin '05—the handsome Facebook co-founder pictured above who later sued Zuckerberg, the lesser known founder, for credit—was a member of the Phoenix. Twin rowers Cameron S. H. and Tyler O. H. Winklevoss '04 were members of the Porcellian (they also thought that Zuckerberg stole their idea).
Whilst on this investigative rite, Sorkin supposedly learned about the infamous "[word-that-rhymes-with-'truck'] truck" that frequents Harvard with girls from nearby all-girls schools, induction rituals, and just overall final club wholesome goodness. Aw shucks, boys.
We applaud you, Mr. Sorkin, for getting the privilege that Zuckerberg could only dream of at the time. What an honor. Maybe you found that better life we're all looking for.

Bored? Not that creative? Simply out of other ideas?
Fear not, for you, too, can write a Harvard novel!
Here’s the recipe: in an environment that’s more of a pressure cooker than a melting pot, mix together a pinch of class war, a handful of post-high school hormones, and the uncooked cutlets of an existential quest on the part of an undeveloped protagonist. If you can find them, maybe throw in some alluring allusions to the names of real famous people, but, if not, no worries. Just go ahead and dump the whole thing on a plate, and dish it up with gusto. You might just have yourself a bestseller.
Given the preponderance in recent years of the Harvard tell-all—Keith A. Gessen’s '97 "All the Sad Young Literary Men," Nick McDonnell’s '06-'07 "An Expensive Education," Ross G. Douthat’s '02 (non-fictional) "Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class," to name a few—it should come as no surprise that another of these masterpieces is about to hit the shelves. And "The Ivy," by Lauren E. Kunze '08 and Rina A. Onur '08, will be in good company with the other titles on the growing list of Harvard books written about Harvard by graduates of Harvard, all for the purpose of exploring (exploiting?) what Harvard life is actually like up at Harvard. Harvard Harvard Harvard.
Kunze and Onur, former roommates at—you guessed it—have written a book about freshman year at, well, you guessed it again. Specifically about the sentimental education an innocent California girl receives as she wades her way through the decidedly unfriendly waters of the American aristocracy and the upwardly mobile. It’s due out Aug. 31 and—this just in—is reported to feature yet another innocent outsider come to Cambridge seeking an education and who becomes a jaded, somewhat disillusioned twenty-something, sort of cynical but educated indeed.
(Sort of, in a weird way, like the readers who buy these books only to discover what they’re actually like inside).
