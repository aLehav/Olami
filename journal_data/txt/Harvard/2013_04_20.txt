After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square remained quiet Friday night as students and residents slowly took back to the streets following the conclusion of a manhunt for the second Marathon bombing suspect that left much of the greater Boston area effectively on lockdown.
Although members of the community did not congregate in the Square to celebrate the suspect’s capture, those walking outside expressed relief that he had been taken into custody, as well as sadness at the events of the last week.
“I’m just glad he got caught,” said Gwen Helou, who was visiting a friend in Cambridge and lives in Glendale Heights, Ill. Helou flew into Boston Friday morning and was unable to leave the airport until 5:30 or 6 p.m. because of the lockdown. “I’m glad it’s over,” she said.
Friday night’s capture culminated a week of violence in Boston that began Monday afternoon when two bombs detonated at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring more than 170, and continued Thursday night with the fatal shooting of an MIT police officer and the chase of the two bombing suspects through Cambridge and Watertown.
“I think it’s just incredibly sad and a horrible end to a horrible week,” said John Andress, a Somerville resident.
Some residents acknowledged that even with the suspect in custody, the investigation is not over.
Tiffany M. Lopinsky ’16 said she was happy that the suspect was caught by law enforcement but added that she was still nervous because she was “not sure what else is out there.”
While the Square was quiet, residents in Boston and Watertown came together in spirited celebration late Friday night.
Jennifer P. Page, a Cambridge resident and the friend whom Helou was visiting on Friday, reflected on Cambridge’s return to business after the lockdown’s conclusion.
“It’s nice to see the city moving again,” Page said. “Because when else is Harvard Square not bustling?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the cancellation of Visitas weekend Friday afternoon, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson Friday night that officials may consider the possibility of granting an extension for accepted students to reply to their offers of admission to the College.
He said other Ivy League admissions officers had been in email communication with him Friday about the possibility of extending the reply date.
When considering the possible extension, Fitzsimmons said the Office of Admissions will “monitor the situation as we go along,” adding that there may be “some specific situations where students will need more information from either students or faculty.”
Harvard’s decision to cancel its annual spring admitted students weekend came amid a manhunt for the second suspect in Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings that paralyzed the greater Boston area for a full day. The cancellation of Visitas programming left some admitted students considering Harvard without the opportunity to visit campus and learn about extracurricular and academic offerings.
Fitzsimmons said that “it’s absolutely impossible to know” if the cancellation will have an impact on the Class of 2017’s yield.
“This is an unprecedented event,” Fitzsimmons said, “and it’s very difficult to know how it might go.”
With MBTA closures on Friday preventing visiting prospective freshmen from traveling from Boston Logan International Airport to Cambridge, Fitzsimmons and other admissions officers and administrators traveled to the airport to receive them. The Harvard officials met with a group of more than 100 admitted students and parents in Terminal E.
“It was very interesting to watch them talk,” Fitzsimmons said. “In some cases they were trying to convince one another to join the Harvard Class of 2017.”
Fitzsimmons said the “vast majority” of the students he spoke with at the airport Friday had decided to matriculate to Harvard.
Fitzsimmons said that although Visitas weekend will not be rescheduled, the Office of Admissions will make a continuing effort to contact admitted students who remain undecided.
“Obviously, we are sorry that the program had to be canceled, but we do believe we can reach out,” Fitzsimmons said.
Fitzsimmons said he anticipates that the Office of Admissions will reach out to prospective students via email and telephone, as well as through the official Class of 2017 Facebook group, in the coming weeks. The Facebook group was made by the Office of Admissions, and admitted students must be approved to join, said Noah S. Selsby ’94, assistant dean for administration.
Despite the weekend’s cancellation, Fitzsimmons said a large percentage of admitted students have already visited campus in the past. He also cited other resources, such as websites, blogs, and guidebooks, as sources of information available to students making a decision.
“I think that the amount of information people have is quite adequate, ultimately, for them to make a decision,” Fitzsimmons said.
