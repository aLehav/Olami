After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After ranking nearly every aspect of my college experience on a scale from one to five, the last question on the College’s Senior Survey asked me what the most memorable part of Harvard has been. The answer that popped into my head was “being here.” Which I wouldn’t have been, were it not for the now-defunct transfer admissions program.
There are some things we’d be better off without: jaywalking laws, spam (definitely the email kind, maybe the “food” kind too), pollution. But as I finish my third and final year as a student at Harvard, and as the college has quietly done away with transfer admissions a year after announcing a two-year suspension of the program, I continue to hope that Harvard doesn’t permanently decide that transfer students are one of the things the school is better off without than with. I fear that institutional inertia will lead Harvard to continue along its current path rather than return to what was, but in this case, it’s worth it to overcome that inertia.
The temporary suspension of transfer admissions was explained last March as the result of overcrowded upperclass Houses that, when taking into account the number of students who would already be living in the Houses in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 academic years, could not feasibly take on the burden of any more students. Could the school not even accept 12 transfer students per year? That would amount to a grand total of one additional resident of each House.
While we are all intimately familiar with the overcrowded nature of many or most of the Houses, the value of having a transfer program outweighs the very small number of extra beds gained by not having one, a number that does not actually ease overcrowding to any considerable degree. Moreover, there are some extra beds here and there in the Houses; I lived this year with four other people in what is typically a six-person suite. I would have happily sacrificed having two common rooms for the continuation of the transfer program. Certainly I recognize that my living situation this year is the exception and not the rule and that it was not predictable, but it does show that there is some room for movement.
Moreover, Harvard really did the transfer process right—something of which no student at the college will soon have any recollection. Our orientation, which was longer than freshman orientation, was led exclusively—save for two mandatory meetings—by students who had transferred in previous semesters. The required meetings were not “Sex Signals” or anything of the like but simply relayed to us academic-related information that we needed to know. The rest of the week consisted of optional social events and meals. In turn, this set-up placed very little responsibility on Harvard’s administrative resources, adding only a minimal amount of work to their Freshman Week load.
A friend of mine who transferred to Yale as a sophomore was assigned to live in Old Campus, the equivalent of a second-year student here living in the Yard. At another school where I was accepted as a transfer student, all the literature I received welcomed me to the class of 2010—the freshman class that year, not the class I would actually be entering. Harvard treated its transfers both as transfers and as students older than freshmen. At the champagne brunch in Annenberg earlier this spring, acquaintances and casual friends asked what freshman entryway I had lived in. When I told them I had transferred here, they were completely surprised. It’s a shame to see something that Harvard did so well fall by the wayside. 
My fellow transfer students are some of the happiest people I know here, with an outside point of view and basis for comparison that allow for a heightened appreciation of all that Harvard has to offer. The student body as a whole benefits from this diversity of perspective that transfers bring in and suffers without it. Harvard must be able to admit that mistakes can be made: A student could have made a mistake not applying to or not choosing Harvard the first time around, and the admissions office could have made a mistake in not accepting a student the first time around.
When I was considering transferring during my freshman year of college, I looked with disdain upon Princeton when I learned that it was— at the time—the only other Ivy League school that did not accept transfer students. I thought that it represented a brand of elitism that was unique to Princeton. That school remains Harvard’s only Ivy League partner-in-crime in this decision. And, outside of the Ivy League, top schools like Stanford, Duke, the University of Chicago, Amherst, Williams, and Swarthmore all accept transfer students. Harvard should be as concerned about losing strong potential transfer students to these schools as it is for regular admissions.
Harvard would do well not to close the door after freshman year: There’s a lot to be gained from transfer admissions by everyone involved.

It is natural for political parties to seek power. As a Republican, I root for Republicans to win as many elections as possible. But I hope I am objective enough to recognize that our country is often ill-served by the concentration of political power in one party’s hands, regardless of which party holds it.
Our nation’s founders clearly saw this danger. In Federalist 51, James Madison defended the virtue of divided government: “If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.”
Madison and his brethren brilliantly sought to limit the danger of one-party factionalism by establishing a political system with numerous checks and balances. But even with obstacles in place, political leaders frequently run amok when power is concentrated in the hands of one party.
American history is replete with examples. The complete Republican federal dominance after the Civil War led to an overzealous Congress in the Reconstruction Period and massive corruption in President Grant’s administration. Democratic one-party rule from the early 1930s until the mid ‘40s culminated in sclerotic post-World War II policies that failed to account for the vast changes in our country, and once more, to massive cronyism and corruption.
In the present age, we have experienced again the consequences of unchecked, one-party dominance. From 2001-2007, Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress and the White House. At the height of its power, following the 2004 elections, Republicans had a 55-seat Senate majority and a 232-seat House majority. Some party leaders got carried away and pursued policies that grew their own power at the expense of American taxpayers. Their unlimited power led to runaway spending, an explosion in obscenely wasteful and parochial earmarks, a lack of transparency, and once again corruption that sent several members of Congress to court and some to prison.
To most taxpayers, this was a sad turn of events. For years, Republicans sought political power so they could implement the kind of limited-government reforms they claimed to stand for. But when they finally got their hands on the Senate, House, and White House, some in the GOP abused that power.
The beauty of our democratic system is that it is self-correcting. The problem is that the corrections meted out by an understandably outraged electorate often push the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. Last November, voters understandably upset with Republican excesses, gave the Democratic Party the presidency along with complete and expanded control of Congress. Predictably, one-party Democratic rule is proving susceptible to the same dangers that befell Republicans, and have befallen so many predecessors throughout our history.
Over the past five months, the Democratic monopoly has expanded the federal government by historic proportions. It began with further taxpayer-funded bailouts of Wall Street and the auto companies, then extended the bailout fever to the housing industry. After campaigning on a promise to end the Republicans’ tenure of irresponsibility, full Democratic control in Washington has produced policies that reward rampant irresponsible behavior and penalize innocent and responsible taxpayers who are forced to foot the bill.
Still, there’s more. A unified Democratic government passed a partisan $787 billion stimulus bill and another $410 billion spending bill. After promising to end the Republican tenure of pork-barrel spending, these massive bills included titanic lists of pork projects. The projected budget deficit for the fiscal year 2009 grew to $1.8 trillion, or a shocking and nearly unprecedented 12.3 percent of our gross domestic product. They then proceeded to pass a new record-breaking $3.6 trillion budget for the upcoming year.
Unchecked power pushes parties to excess regardless of which party is in power. It is an inherent part of both human nature and the nature of government.  
The danger for our country is that with complete one-party dominance, much damage will be done before the next electoral self-correction. As Democrats near 60 votes in the Senate, their majority will have a blank check to pass any legislation they want. Historically, the final check against one-party control has been the Senate minority party’s ability to mount a filibuster. With only 40 Senate Republicans that tool is lost, leaving Democrats with no need to check their extremes—anything goes.
Most Americans prefer balance in Washington. Like our Founders, they understand that too much concentration of power is a dangerous and frequently corrupting thing. It’s easy for us Republicans to recognize this when we’re in the political wilderness. Here’s hoping that we remember it next time we’re in power. And here’s hoping that in the meantime, sober-thinking Democrats learn the lesson of history and act humbly with the powers they’ve been given.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cold morning in the middle of February, the greatest baseball player of his generation faced the press in disgrace. Alex Rodriguez, the all-star third baseman with 560 career home runs—about one for every  $500,000 in his $275 million contract—had tested positive for steroids, casting a Bondsian shadow over his Ruthian accomplishments.
But Rodriguez wasn’t the only man named Alex to make headlines for performance enhancement this year. In April, The New Yorker told the story of a very different “Alex”—a recent Harvard grad whose Adderall habit was the centerpiece of a feature documenting the prevalence of neuroenhancers on campus.
Both drug users garnered their fair share of criticism. Baseball pundits fumed at A-Rod (and later at his unlikely partner in ignominy, Manny Ramirez) for disgracing the game, casting his offense as an affront to the essence of sport. Meanwhile, closer to home, The Crimson responded to the New Yorker article by chastising study drug users for “trying to accomplish more than is within their natural abilities.” 
Part of this disapproval centers around simple distaste for rule breaking. A-Rod is a cheater. College students who pop Adderall and Ritalin without prescriptions are, at least technically, criminals. But that can’t be the end of the story. If we had no cause to condemn performance enhancement other than its illegality, there would be little sense in maintaining our bans and proscriptions.
Instead, sportswriters who wring their hands whenever the next superstar tests positive and college kids who cry foul when their roommates buy amphetamines express a more fundamental discomfort with our increasing ability to enhance natural capabilities. But is this unease at the prospect of juiced-up sluggers and pill-popping mathletes a morally legitimate intuition?
This is an important question to ask, because steroids and study drugs are only the beginning. For now, we can cite concerns of safety when outlawing performance-enhancing substances—in the future, it may not be so easy. A new generation of enhancers is on the horizon that will make the current batch look like child’s play. Powerful genetic therapies like IGF-I injections and myostatin blockers promise to fuel the athletes of tomorrow with few negative consequences. Meanwhile, with geneticists identifying correlates of mental attributes and millions of research dollars being poured into drugs that halt cognitive decline, minds as well as bodies are becoming open to augmentation.
The fact is, humans are increasingly capable of remolding themselves in the image of whatever they choose, with fewer and fewer unpleasant side effects. We can either embrace this development or—as the current inclination seems to be—do everything in our power to avoid it. Our gut pulls us towards the second option, but I think our heads should pick the first.
The level of concern over Alex the New York Yankee and Alex the New Yorker interviewee is, in many ways, peculiar. In general, we prize excellence, and encourage our sons and daughters to achieve success through whatever means necessary, whether on the baseball field or in the library.  Professional athletes and Harvard students both earn respect for their “enhanced performance,” and the lengths to which they have gone to attain it. The meritocracy doles out lucrative compensation accordingly.
Therefore, our tendency to label performance-enhancing drugs antithetical to our values makes little sense. The spirit behind performance enhancement doesn’t detract from the game of baseball or the game of life. Instead, it represents the apotheosis of an ethic of self-perfection that is at the heart of what we find praiseworthy.  
It is hard to fault an intervention that makes everyone better at what they do without an extremely compelling reason. If this power came in any other form, we would not hesitate to use it, just as few complain about how weight training makes athletes stronger and computers make students more productive—even though neither is “natural.” But for some reason, when excellence comes in pill form, it’s hard to swallow.
One school of thought contends that this hesitance originates in the fear that chemical enhancement will undermine the “justice” of the world by decoupling effort and success. But the link between the two was already tenuous. Life’s race is handicapped from the start by genetic and circumstantial factors far beyond anyone’s control. And once things are underway, as the Bible poetically notes, often “the race is not to the swift.” 
In a world of ubiquitous performance enhancement, effort still matters, but everyone’s contribution gets them just a little bit further. This springboard effect has the potential to generate rewards for all members of society, because many desirable human attributes—like intelligence—are not merely positional advantages, but also confer absolute benefits, like new cures for diseases or great works of art.
We might have reason to worry about unequal access to enhancement, but it is unclear that greater restrictiveness is the right way to combat this problem. When only athletes willing to bend the rules and students with the money to get their hands on an Adderall prescription can benefit, then inequality results. But if we instead work to make enhancement available to all, we create a level playing field—only this one is several rungs higher than the old, unenhanced version. (This logic led the equality-loving John Rawls to conclude that genetic engineering was a boon, as it potentially improved the endowment of every member of society).
The next step forward in self-improvement may be “unnatural.” But why worry? The fetishisation of the natural displayed by those who draw hard and fast distinctions between chemical enhancement and other forms of striving for excellence is dependent upon a senseless equation of the way things are with the way things must be. The argument loses its appeal when we realize that our bodies and minds were not created by an intelligent planner but by a biological process that sought to maximize the number of viable offspring, not the amount of human happiness and achievement. We need not be content with what life hands us—in fact, we rarely are.
The Olympic motto, “Citius, altius, fortius”—faster, higher, stronger—describes the human project as well as a decathlete’s training goals. What separates us from animals is our ability to refuse to accept the given and break the chains of biological contingency. 
So Alex and Alex may be cheaters. But they’re also ahead of the curve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Commencement approaches, Harvard likes to think it has helped to produce another class of leaders. But are leaders born or made? Is nature or nurture more important? I address these questions in my recent book, The Powers to Lead. How often have you heard someone say that a political candidate looks (or does not look) like a leader? A tall handsome person enters a room, draws attention, and “looks like a leader.” Various studies have shown that tall men are often favored, and corporate CEOs are taller than average. Moreover, tall men tend to earn more than shorter men. Other things being equal, an inch of height is worth nearly $800 a year in salary. But that may simply tell us about the stereotypes of what corporate boards think a CEO should look like and not that taller men are better leaders. Some of the most powerful leaders in history, such as Napoleon, Stalin, and Deng Hsiao Ping were little over five feet tall. Physical traits such as physique, intellectual traits such as IQ, and personality traits such as extroversion have been extensively examined by researchers, but with poor explanatory results. Tests have shown there is no leadership gene. While studies might find a certain trait to be significant, there always seems to be considerable evidence that fails to confirm that trait’s importance. Context is often more important than traits. The athletic child who is the natural leader on the playground may lose that dominant position when the group returns to a well structured classroom. For example, in January 1940, Winston Churchill was regarded as a failed politician, but after the British defeat in France, he was seen as a charismatic leader who could rally the nation. Churchill’s traits did not change in 1940; the situation did.The traits-centered approach has not vanished from modern studies of leadership but it has been broadened and made more flexible. Traits have come to be seen as consistent patterns of personality rather than inherited characteristics. This definition mixes nature and nurture, and means that “traits” can, to some extent, be learned rather than merely inherited. We talk about leaders being more energetic, more risk-taking, more optimistic, more persuasive, and more empathetic than other people, but these traits are affected partly by a leader’s genetic makeup and partly by the environments in which the traits were learned and developed.A nice experiment recently demonstrated the interaction between nature and nurture. A group of employers were asked to hire workers who had been ranked by their looks. If the employers saw only the resumes, beauty had no impact on hiring. Surprisingly, however, when telephone interviews were included in the process, beautiful people did better even though unseen by the employers. A lifetime of social reinforcement based on their genetic looks may have encoded into their voice patterns a tone of confidence that could be projected over the phone. Nature and nurture became thoroughly intertwined.Genetics and biology matter in human leadership, but they do not determine it in the way that the traditional heroic approach to leadership suggests. The “Big Man” type of leadership works well in societies based on networks of tribal cultures which rely on personal and family honor and loyalty, but are not well adapted for coping with today’s complex information based world. Institutional constraints such as constitutions and impartial legal systems circumscribe such heroic figures. Societies that rest on heroic leaders are not able to develop the civil society and broad social capital that are necessary for leading in today’s networked world. Modern leadership turns out to be less about who you are, or how you were born than about what you have learned and what you do as part of a group. Nature and nurture intertwine, but nurture is much more important in the modern world than the heroic paradigm gives it credit for. Rather than think of your fellow graduates in terms of a particular type of heroic individual—male or female—look instead for indications that they (and you) have developed the judgment to broaden your bandwidth and cope with the wide range of new situations you are bound to encounter. That contextual intelligence will be the key to effective leadership.Joseph S. Nye, Jr., former Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, is author of The Powers to Lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the four years I’ve been at Harvard, the Student Labor Action Movement has been one of the least popular groups on campus. To be sure, the group is dedicated to an admirable goal—higher wages for Harvard’s lowest-paid employees. But the dogmatism with which SLAM activists put forward their arguments has turned off many lefties who would otherwise be sympathetic to their cause. After all, SLAM has managed to alienate me, and I spent last summer working at a labor law firm whose head partner supports repealing the Reagan tax cuts.
In the past couple weeks, however, I’ve come to realize that there is something to admire about SLAM’s leaders. On a campus where most people are too worried or too self-conscious to express their opinions freely, SLAM is a welcome reminder that some students do speak their minds without compunction.
I began to see SLAM as refreshing—rather than nauseating—a few days after I wrote a somewhat-incendiary editorial piece calling for specific administrators to be laid off to help deal with the fiscal crisis. Though I expected the piece to be controversial, I didn’t expect the dozens of e-mails praising me for being “ballsy,” “brave,” and even “courageous.”
Truth be told, these sentiments did more to worry than to reassure me. I walked around for the next day wondering if I had done something stupid. “Brave,” as far as I could tell, meant reckless. I couldn’t shake what one of my roommates had told me when I mentioned my plans for the piece a few days before it was printed. “They’re going to come after you,” he had said. When I asked him who “they” were and what, if anything, they could do, he just looked at me worriedly and said, “Be careful.”
It turned out to be a non-issue. Though the piece generated debate, the negative repercussions were non-existent, apart from a couple terse e-mails from administrators. But recalling my roommate’s admonishment, and how I had felt immediately after the piece was printed, I began to wonder how so many of us have become conditioned to withhold our opinions when it comes to issues that affect Harvard. Indeed, as I stopped to think about it, I realized that nearly all
of us have been silent for years on issues that go to the heart of the
University.
It’s a reticence that stands in stark contrast to how we act when expressing our views on politics or society, and it’s one that affects professors just as much as students.
There was almost no debate, for example about who Lawrence H. Summer’s replacement as university president should have been, despite the fact that virtually all of the candidates were publicly known and had been profiled extensively in the media. No student, professor, or campus organization I know of openly supported a particular candidate, even though many had private opinions they would readily share. (I was barred from expressing my opinion as a reporter covering the search, so I will do so now: I favored Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan or Howard Hughes Medical Institute chief Thomas R. Cech, a Nobel laureate in biology.) 
Similarly, dozens of junior professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Law School have complained to me over the years that tenured professorships are “occupied” by older faculty who no longer actively publish or teach. This, they argue, is detrimental to the academy since it keeps faculties filled with unproductive scholars and makes it extremely difficult for younger ones to begin their academic careers. But no students or faculty at Harvard have called publicly for reassessing how faculty are appointed and kept on. The one person who has is Summers, who did so in a speech after he left office. The speech was at Tufts.
To be fair, there are some people at Harvard who have not been shy in making their voices heard. During my short time here, professors like classicist Richard F. Thomas and computer scientist Harry R. Lewis ’68 have been raising and debating many questions of importance to Harvard’s institutional well being. (Lewis even wrote a book sharing his opinions on Harvard’s direction as a university—he tellingly titled it, “Excellence Without a Soul.”) These voices, though, seem few are far between, despite the fact that there is little reason to stay silent. The University is not run by a bunch of ayatollahs, as the uneventfullness of my brief foray into public tactlessness seems to show.
Universities thrive on the vigorous clash of ideas. This is true for debates that happen at a university, and for debates that happen about a university. If we fail to make our voices heard about the most critical issues Harvard faces, its future will be poorer. And so as irritating as a group like SLAM can be, the next time I read an overly shrill statement given in support of one of their campaigns, I’ll at least respect the fact that they’re expressing an opinion in an effort to make Harvard a better place. It’s their silent opponents who are doing Harvard the disservice.

I was a small boy amidst the patriotism of the Second World War. I learned to love America as the face of liberty, the palladium of justice, and the embodiment of the ideal of government under law, not under men. This paramount place of Law is etched in Latin above the entrance to our law school; it is our shining national ideal, the religion of America, the essence of the enlightenment that flowed from our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights. 
This American ideal is in crisis as never before, the challenge of re-establishing its luster has never been greater. Leaders like Johnson and Nixon may have besmirched it but they never argued outright that law should be subservient to executive power. The Bush administration, with Cheney as its architect and now its spokesman, flat out attacked our core American ideal, attempting to convince us and the world by its actions and rhetoric that Law is an inconvenient impediment to security to be openly dispensed with at executive behest.
Now comes President Obama—a lawyer, a teacher, a man of the constitution —to contest for the ideal. He is challenged, like Lincoln, to make the law of our constitution our guide. His challenge will be played out at home and abroad in the courts of our consciences and of public opinion. Do we believe in Law, or in its subversion? Can we hold on to the wisdom of Socrates and the hopes and ideals of our founders, or will we bow to the cynicism and power of the autocrat? Can we express our ideals in the testimony of our lives and the process of our institutions, or do we accept our fall?
How can Obama do it? How can we do it? How can our country reassert the ideal of American law?
I believe an answer lies in a combination of return to the most basic participatory element of our original constitutional design, projected to our citizenry and our world by our most modern technology: a reconception of the public American jury trial. 
Central to our founding constitutional vision was the public jury trial—in a proceeding that was fully open to the public, in which the jury expressed the conscience of the community. The founders contemplated that the jury would act as a source of wisdom and moderation, as the ultimate judge of fact and law; it was to act as a check in our constitutional system of checks and balances on the otherwise unchecked discretionary prosecutorial power of the executive. No citizen could have his liberty taken away without the unanimous consent of an empowered, powerful jury of his peers. Participation in jury service used to be the most direct act of civic responsibility that a citizen could undertake. 
This jury no longer exists. The jury’s function has been degraded over time to that of mere fact-finder. Now, we jurors serve only as subsidiary functionaries, determining whether the letter of the law has been broken. Arguments addressed to the jury’s wisdom and rightful power to check prosecutorial discretion are repressed as nullification. Jury service has become boring, often meaningless, and it is seen as a burden. We need to look back to our founding fathers. They intended the jury to be the bulwark of our liberty. Our modern juries should be and do no less.
What is more, we need to look forward. At present, our trials and our trial processes in the courts of the United States of America are effectively hidden from public view, seen and heard only by those few who attend. The only record of the whole proceeding is a written transcript that must be purchased to be seen, or such reports as those few in physical attendance choose to make. The constitutional ideal of government-of-and-by-the-people is hollow when the people lack the real and practical means to see and hear and understand the proceedings for themselves. 
In the age of Internet we can open our courtrooms to complete, trustworthy, inexpensive, gavel-to-gavel access to our courts. True Internet access to court proceedings is key to reviving the central and ideal place of law in America. Our courts demonstrate the centrality of law and of constitutional rights every day. They aspire to (and often exemplify) the ideals of our government. Our courts affirm that we are a government under law. With Internet, all people all over the world can witness the administration of justice in America. Contrary to Cheney’s assertion that we need secrecy, force and torture to ensure our national security, we would achieve greater security by reasserting our openness and fairness. Instead of hiding our judicial process from public, our judiciary should open up its process. By demonstrating the quality of American legal process to our citizenry and our world, we show pride and respect for our country and our ideals. Respect breeds security and friendship.
We are the Internet generation. With enlightened leadership and our own willingness to step forward as civic participants in forming the collective consciousness of America, we can combine the power of the net and the power of our fundamental law to transform and project our understanding of ourselves. By opening the process of our courts to public access through the net and restoring the American jury to its rightful place in our democracy, I believe we will once again live the essential meaning of a government of the people under law, and represent this ideal to the world.

Come join the bucket brigade. If you are a graduate of Harvard College or any of the schools of the University, we need you, right now!
Harvard College is only one part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, but the impact of the present financial crisis on the whole of FAS and, in turn, on Harvard College and the House system presents a serious challenge to the Harvard community. 
I have been asked to offer some reflections on this extraordinary year from my standpoint as a professor, a department chair, and a house master. The first word that comes to mind is meetings. There have been countless hours of meetings, attended by the faithful on the faculty, the caucus of chairs, the house masters—all with charts and PowerPoint presentations demonstrating an unprecedented 220 million dollar deficit in fiscal year 2010, getting worse thereafter. 
We have met with Dean Michael D. Smith of FAS, Dean Allan M. Brandt of GSAS, Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds of Harvard College. None of them bargained for this crisis when they came on board. Neither did President Drew G. Faust. “Harvard is not invulnerable to the seismic financial shocks in the larger world,” she told us in a letter this fall. “Our own economic landscape has been significantly altered.” We would all need to navigate between these seemingly incompatible goals: the need “to advance our priorities for teaching, research, and service” and the need “to absorb unprecedented endowment losses and plan for a period of greater financial constraint.” 
In November, Dean Smith explained at an FAS faculty meeting about the “three buckets” and the need to set priorities in everything we do. In the first and smallest bucket go our highest priorities, those things so important we might need to increase spending on them. In the second medium-sized bucket go things central to the core mission of FAS that cannot be reduced. In the third and largest bucket is everything else, and much of it will have to go. 
We all reflected on our own priorities. I listened, as a professor affiliated with two departments that have scant resources to start with and are constantly pleading for augmentation. For years, the tiny Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies has been trying to get the study of South Asia on the intellectual map of FAS and is working, even now, to create a broader program in South Asian languages, cultures, and histories. India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Tibet—all are ever more important to understanding the world in which we live. And for many years, the Study of Religion has operated as a degree-granting Committee without departmental status, patching together faculty and courses from many departments and from the Divinity School. Meanwhile, the energies of religion have hardly subsided in the face of secularism. In fact, the religious traditions of humankind are flourishing in all their diversity, creating worldwide promise and worldwide pestilence. Basic religious literacy has never been a more important educational priority. 
Harvard can be proud of its bold new initiatives in the sciences and engineering, and of course many of us dream of new initiatives in the Humanities as well. But will our dreams land in bucket one or even bucket two?
And what of Lowell House and the other Harvard Houses? We have spent hundreds of hours of faculty, student, and staff time studying House expansion and renewal. Five or six years ago, we were looking at Allston. Houses, athletic fields, buildings were being imaginatively moved hither and yon to create a new campus. As the financial crisis began, that came to a halt. Then it was renewing the infrastructure of the Houses, particularly the river Houses like Lowell, still vastly overcrowded and deeply in need of full-scale renovation. That too had to come to a halt. We are, however, moving ahead on the basic, urgent issues of safety, installing sprinkler systems where they did not exist, including in Lowell House. The rest will have to wait.
In a message to faculty in October, President Faust wisely observed, “The residential House system is a cornerstone of the undergraduate experience at Harvard. Houses at Harvard are far more than just buildings. They are the locus where teaching, learning, advising and vibrant community all intersect.” I couldn’t agree more. And when the comprehensive Report on Harvard House Renewal was released in April 2009, Dean Hammonds affirmed the importance of the Houses as “essential, not ancillary, to a Harvard education.” Almost simultaneously, however, deep financial cuts to the Houses were proposed.
The reality of the “seismic” crisis meant, at first, a 15 percent budget cut for the Houses. We all worked at it. Then it was a 25 percent cut. House masters feared that next 10 percent would shake the foundations of the House system. What would go? Senior Common Rooms? Faculty-student dinners? House library hours? Modest stipends for fellowships tutors? Arts internships? Masters open houses? Junior parents weekends? Facebooks? Hot breakfasts? Then, when it was suggested that House administrative staff be reduced, we felt the cuts had hit bone. For decades, the Houses have operated without administrative staff growth, even though the responsibilities of House administration have grown. These cuts would disable the very functioning of the Harvard Houses. 
For any student or graduate of Harvard, the Houses are not simply residential outposts of University Hall. They are the very heart of Harvard College, the hub of the wheel that holds together, for students, the often-bewildering complexity of Harvard administration. This is where students live, where their academic records are kept, where their successes are heralded, their vulnerabilities noticed and responded to. This is where they will today receive their diplomas. The Houses are cherished not only by students, but also by tutors, faculty, and staff who are part of these unique, intergenerational, academic communities. Undermining the House system cannot be on the table, even in this crisis.
To be sure, FAS departments, Harvard College, and the Houses are doing what we can to cut our budgets. Reimagining the shape of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and renewing the energy of Harvard Houses are critical and exciting tasks. We willingly undertake them. Working groups are at work—in Humanities, Sciences, Social Sciences, and on the Houses, on Student Life, on Undergraduate Education. Our salaries are frozen. But will all this really save the $200 million a year necessary to meet the structural deficit inherited by our talented and visionary President? Can they really do anything by next November or by the beginning of the next fiscal year? Does the Harvard Corporation actually see what it is asking of the president, the faculty, and the deans of one of the finest universities in the world?
As we gather for this happy, spirited academic festival, Harvard needs the immediate commitment of everyone who has benefited from a Harvard education. So, to the thousands gathered today for Harvard Commencement, I say, “Come stand with us. Join the bucket brigade. Put something big in one of those three buckets, with no restrictions. Our students deserve it. Our President deserves it. And you, the graduates of this great university, deserve it as well. As we look around today, take note: we are all in this together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Are MBAs so concerned with increasing their personal wealth that they ignore ethics and their responsibilities to society?” So asks the introduction to the MBA Oath, a code of conduct written and publicized by a group of second-year students at Harvard Business School this spring. By becoming a signatory, MBAs pledge, among other noble things, to “act with utmost integrity and pursue [their] work in an ethical manner.” As of yesterday, about 40 percent of the approximately 900 members in the HBS Class of 2009 had signed the online oath. But must MBAs really chose between greed and virtue?
Fortunately, there may not be such a real trade-off between self-interest and an ethical life. Recently, empirical studies have helped us better understand the important relationship between living an ethical life and living a happy life. And while it may be easy enough to believe that unethical behavior—defined by egoism and greed—could be a clear path to happiness, recent research suggests otherwise.
According to psychologists James Konow and Joseph Earley, income really only provides happiness at the lower levels of the earnings spectrum—when paying for necessities. So MBAs and others who egoistically seek to maximize income as a path to happiness are likely taking the wrong approach. Unethical or immoral behavior as a means to increase income, therefore, is probably not the right way to attain overall happiness either.
This finding has many potential psychological explanations. For example, it could be that individuals are mainly concerned with their relative wealth in comparison to others. If incomes grow consistently across the socioeconomic distribution, then we would not expect to see happiness grow much at all, save for those in the lowest earning bracket. Reinforcing the effect, as individuals gain wealth they often change social groups—and begin interacting with other higher earning individuals. Thus, as we gain wealth, the people we choose to compare ourselves against may also become wealthier, leading to little change in relative position.
There can also be a gap between our ambitions and our achievements. Problems arise when our aspirations grow faster than our accomplishments. As we gain wealth at some rate, our aspirations may grow at an even quicker rate, leaving us constantly unsatisfied. People who, out of self-interest or greed, put their own aspirations above the needs of others, may again be taking the wrong approach to happiness.  
This finding has been described as the “Hedonistic Paradox”, which states that those who seek happiness for their own benefit often find themselves disappointed, whereas those who seek to improve the well-being of others may have a greater likelihood of being happy themselves. Research shows that those who are altruistic and selfless often have higher levels of happiness. Psychologists Ed Diener and Pelin Kesebir write, “Happiness appears to bring out the best in humans, making them more social, more cooperative, and even more ethical.” These findings are consistent across multiple studies and environments. Moreover, according to Earley and Konow, “some tasks, such as helping others, appear capable of sustaining happiness at a higher average level than other goals, like the pursuit of material wealth.”
Unfortunately, direct empirical analysis linking the role of ethical and moral values to happiness has been very limited. More typical, and still highly interesting, has been the study of how pro-social behavior, such as altruism, or other specific components of an ethical life, influence happiness. Voluntarism, for example, is a specific pro-social behavior that provides a good measure of altruism. In fact, volunteer work is one of the most practiced and important pro-social activities across the globe. Of adults in the U.S., 50 percent participate in volunteer activities, doing the amount of labor in a year of what would otherwise amount to 5 million full-time jobs. While there are many reasons to volunteer, evidence from recent research suggests that volunteering actually causes higher, sustained happiness levels in individuals, even when controlling for other factors.
All in all, this research suggests that while there may be trade-offs between ethical behavior and the pursuit of wealth, morality no longer seems so difficult when we change the goal to be the pursuit of happiness instead. Perhaps the best way to encourage ethical behavior among MBAs is not to frame “acting in an ethical manner” as a sacrifice—in which wealth is exchanged for virtue—but rather as an opportunity for gain through happiness. Ethical behavior (just like unethical behavior) can be born of self-interest. For everyone’s benefit, publicizing these findings from positive psychology might be just as important as oaths.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu generated speculation over the future relationship between America and Israel, and a potentially changed U.S. policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Analysts on the right and left are commenting on a new, tougher American policy characterized by strengthened U.S. demands on Israel. However, beneath the diplomatic choreography lies an agonizing reality that received only brief comment from Obama and silence from Netanyahu: The ongoing devastation of the people of Gaza.
Gaza is an example of a society that has been deliberately reduced to a state of abject destitution, its once productive population transformed into one of aid-dependent paupers. This context is undeniably one of mass suffering, created largely by Israel but with the active complicity of the international community, especially the U.S. and European Union, and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
Gaza’s subjection began long before Israel’s recent war against it. The Israeli occupation—now largely forgotten or denied by the international community—has devastated Gaza’s economy and people, especially since 2006. Although economic restrictions actually increased before Hamas’ electoral victory in January 2006, the deepened sanction regime and siege subsequently imposed by Israel and the international community, and later intensified in June 2007 when Hamas seized control of Gaza, has all but destroyed the local economy. If there has been a pronounced theme among the many Palestinians, Israelis, and internationals who I have interviewed in the last three years, it was the fear of damage to Gaza’s society and economy so profound that billions of dollars and generations of people would be required to address it—a fear that has now been realized.
After Israel’s December assault, Gaza’s already compromised conditions have become virtually unlivable. Livelihoods, homes, and public infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed on a scale that even the Israel Defense Forces admitted was indefensible. In Gaza today, there is no private sector to speak of and no industry. 80 percent of Gaza’s agricultural crops were destroyed and Israel continues to snipe at farmers attempting to plant and tend fields near the well-fenced and patrolled border. Most productive activity has been extinguished.
One powerful expression of Gaza’s economic demise—and the Gazans’ indomitable will to provide for themselves and their families—is its burgeoning tunnel economy that emerged long ago in response to the siege. Thousands of Palestinians are now employed digging tunnels into Egypt—around 1,000 tunnels are reported to exist although not all are operational. According to local economists, 90 percent of economic activity in Gaza—once considered a lower middle-income economy (along with the West Bank)—is presently devoted to smuggling.
Today, 96 percent of Gaza’s population of 1.4 million is dependent on humanitarian aid for basic needs. According to the World Food Programme, the Gaza Strip requires a minimum of 400 trucks of food every day just to meet the basic nutritional needs of the population. Yet, despite a March 22nd decision by the Israeli cabinet to lift all restrictions on foodstuffs entering Gaza, only 653 trucks of food and other supplies were allowed entry during the week of May 10, at best meeting 23 percent of required need.
Israel now allows only 30 to 40 commercial items to enter Gaza, compared to 4,000 approved products prior to June 2006. According to the Israeli journalist Amira Hass, Gazans still are denied many commodities (a policy in effect long before the December assault): building materials (including wood for windows and doors), electrical appliances (such as refrigerators and washing machines), spare parts for cars and machines, fabrics, threads, needles, candles, matches, mattresses, sheets, blankets, cutlery, crockery, cups, glasses, musical instruments, books, tea, coffee, sausages, semolina, chocolate, sesame seeds, nuts, milk products in large packages, most baking products, light bulbs, crayons, clothing, and shoes.
Given these constraints, among many others—including the internal disarray of the Palestinian leadership—one wonders how the reconstruction to which Obama referred will be possible. There is no question that people must be helped immediately. Programs aimed at alleviating suffering and reinstating some semblance of normalcy are ongoing, but at a scale shaped entirely by the extreme limitations on the availability of goods. In this context of repressive occupation and heightened restriction, what does it mean to reconstruct Gaza? How is it possible under such conditions to empower people and build sustainable and resilient institutions able to withstand expected external shocks? Without an immediate end to Israel’s blockade and the resumption of trade and the movement of people outside the prison that Gaza has long been, the current crisis will grow massively more acute. Unless the U.S. administration is willing to exert real pressure on Israel for implementation—and the indications thus far suggest they are not—little will change. Not surprisingly, despite international pledges of $5.2 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction, Palestinians there are now rebuilding their homes using mud.
Recently, I spoke with some friends in Gaza, and the conversations were profoundly disturbing. My friends spoke of the deeply felt absence of any source of protection—personal, communal or institutional. There is little in society that possesses legitimacy and there is a fading consensus on rules and an eroding understanding of what they are for. Trauma and grief overwhelm the landscape despite expressions of resilience. The feeling of abandonment among people appears complete, understood perhaps in their growing inability to identify with any sense of possibility. The most striking was this comment: “It is no longer the occupation or even the war that consumes us but the realization of our own irrelevance.”
What possible benefit can be derived from an increasingly impoverished, unhealthy, densely crowded, and furious Gaza alongside Israel? Gaza’s terrible injustice not only threatens Israeli and regional security, but it undermines America’s credibility, alienating our claim to democratic practice and the rule of law.
If Palestinians are continually denied what we want and demand for ourselves—an ordinary life, dignity, livelihood, safety, and a place where they can raise their children—and are forced, yet again, to face the destruction of their families, then the inevitable outcome will be greater and more extreme violence across all factions, both old and increasingly new. What looms is no less than the loss of entire generation of Palestinians. And if this happens—perhaps it already has—we shall all bear the cost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now every student, faculty member, and alum is aware that the global financial calamity has influenced every component of University finances: endowments, private philanthropy, and gifts from cash-strapped foundations. While stimulus funds have temporarily swelled the budgets of federal science agencies, the long-term picture for government funding is hazy at best, and may fall victim to deficit-cutting two years from now. Within Harvard, the deans and central administrators have had the unenviable task of cutting budgets in order to match our expenses to our newly constrained resources. We have all spent many hours since October engaged in these painful exercises. 
It is important to remember, however, that Harvard not only remains a great university, but that we must continue to move forward even in these challenging times. While the deep and likely prolonged nature of the downturn means that budget cutting must be widely distributed across many cherished programs, the deans are also keenly aware that we must be strategic, protecting essential investments, such as financial aid, and even growing in a small number of critically important areas. Indeed, several University-wide committees have been focused on how we can make Harvard stronger in priority areas in the near term, albeit with smaller investments than we would make in other times. These committees, made up of faculty members and deans, include the Harvard University Committee on Science and Engineering, the University Planning Committee on Social Sciences, and the University Library Task Force. 
At the risk of slighting those whose interests go unmentioned because of the brevity of the space available here, I would like to highlight two university priorities: global health and energy and environment. What is it that makes these areas of scholarship and teaching priorities even in the current climate? First, they have real world significance. Global health (which also includes domestic health issues, if only because microbes do not need passports) and issues of energy and environment confront challenges that any great research university must address. The emergence of pandemics, the development of new drugs, vaccines, and devices for neglected diseases, the assurance of access to new discoveries in resource constrained areas, and the impact of these discoveries on diverse populations are centrally important to the world. Similarly, the development of newer, cleaner, cheaper forms of energy and energy storage, the global security issues related to energy, and the diverse problems posed by climate change are extremely significant concerns. 
In addition, from the point of view of bringing the Harvard community together, these areas have the obvious benefit of requiring input from many—indeed most—of our faculties across the University. As intellectual matters, they touch on everything from basic research and scholarship to challenging and important applications that engage our professional schools. The issues presented by global health, energy, and  the environment also cross the boundaries of the natural sciences, engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. For example, the dissemination of antiretroviral drugs in South Africa has, until recently, been inhibited by benighted leadership that denied the role of HIV in causing AIDS; similarly, the World Health Organization’s attempts to eradicate polio have run into ethnic and religious barriers in northern Nigeria and parts of India. Thus biological discovery and technology development can be stymied if not coupled with an understanding of political science, anthropology, and religion. 
Above all, global health and energy and environment are critical areas for the education of our undergraduates and graduate and professional students. The problems of global health and of energy and environment are of interest to many students because they represent some of the paramount problems facing the world today. In consonance with the stated goals of the new General Education curriculum, they connect a liberal education with the problems of the real world that students will engage after graduation. Harvard recognizes the importance of such endeavors. Even today, we must continue to gain strength.

Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood urged the federal government to improve its hiring system in order to attract more talented young workers in a Monday opinion piece in the Washington Times.Ellwood wrote that the government should enhance its recruitment efforts, expand its range of opportunities for talented workers, and improve public management.He also suggested that the government provide more financial motivation to join the public sector, such as through the implementation of programs like the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, where students can receive educational benefits if they commit to working in government after graduation.Ellwood stressed the importance of making these changes now, during what he called a “once-in-a-generation opportunity.”“I think this is an amazingly important, exciting, but also troubling moment,” he said. “It’s exciting because young people are stepping up and want to serve, but it’s frightening because our current system doesn’t always give people the opportunity to serve.”Kennedy School Professor Robert I. Rotberg agreed that the federal government would benefit from an increased number of talented students entering the public sector.“I hope people pay attention and they get developed,” Rotberg said of Ellwood’s suggestions.The number of 2009 Kennedy School graduates who plan to enter the private sector is not yet available, Ellwood said. According to Rotberg, more Kennedy School students this year are turning to the public sector due to the economy.Last year, 35 percent of HKS graduates entered the private sector, a drop from the 41 percent that joined the private sector in 2007.According to Ellwood, many Kennedy School students enter the private sector due to large salary differences, doubts about future opportunities within the public sector, and ineffective government recruiting.For example, private companies extend job offers far more speedily than the federal government, which can often taken nine months to conclude the recruiting process, Ellwood said. The mere weeks a private firm like McKinsey takes to make an offer can push graduates toward the private sector.And McKinsey can also pay a larger salary, Ellwood added.“We have to do better than that if we really want the best,” he said.Ellwood has been focusing on public service at the Kennedy School over the last year, he said.The Student Public Service Collaborative, a Kennedy School organization, also encourages students to be involved in public service and to enter the public sector.“Students have been very aggressive in advancing the public sector and public service more broadly,” Ellwood said.

It is said that cooking is the way to a man’s heart. But according to Harvard Biological Anthropology Professor Richard W. Wrangham, cooking is the way to a good deal more than that. In his book “Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human,” released Monday, Wrangham argues that the invention of cooking allowed for our primate ancestors to become humans. “We are the cooking apes, the creatures of the flame,” said Wrangham in an interview yesterday.Wrangham bases his argument on wide-ranging scientific evidence, both biological and behavioral.Looking at studies in nutritional science, Wrangham determined that cooked food is softer and more easily digestible.“In this way,” he said, “cooking food increases the number of calories we get from it.”This extra energy, Wrangham argues, allows humans to maintain their large brains. “Once you appreciate that point, you can understand that there has been an evolutionary adaptation taking advantage of cooked food.”At the same time, easily digestible food frees the body from the task of chewing. Chimpanzees spend half their day chewing their food, energy not spent in more constructive activities, said Daniel E. Lieberman, a fellow anthropology professor and chair of department’s biological anthropology wing.The book counters earlier hypotheses about human evolution, such as the theory that human evolution stemmed from eating meat, either raw or cooked.The transition to cooking may have had social implications as well. Wrangham argues that the control of the flame gave rise to traditional gender roles, as cooked food became a valuable commodity. “The possibility of [food] theft prompted a primitive protection racket in which women are protected and men get the advantage of being fed,” he said.In previous research, Wrangham studied chimpanzees, even working with famous primatologist Jane Goodall in Tanzania. “They are a good model for human ancestors 6 to 7 million years ago,” he said of the early primates.It is while observing chimpanzees that Wrangham said he began to consider a link between eating and evolution.“I would go for hours, all day, watching chimpanzees and relying only on their food. I realized that we are not well adapted to eat chimp foods,” said Wrangham.The cooking thesis has raised excitement among Wrangham’s colleagues, according to Lieberman.“We take behaviors like cooking and food preparation for granted,” Lieberman said, “but we are obligate cookers. To be honest, nobody had really thought about it before Richard.”—Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz can be reached at mschwart@fas.harvard.edu.

After running through two resident deans in just two years, Cabot House has appointed writing tutor Jill Constantino to fill the post next year, House Master Jay M. Harris announced on Monday.Constantino—a Cabot dining hall fixture known for her approachable nature and commitment to undergraduate education—will replace Mya M. Mangawang, who served as resident dean for only a year before abruptly announcing her resignation in May.“I hope to spread a little of what makes me happy,” Constantino wrote in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “I look forward to becoming more involved in the community here. I hope I can help students reach for their intellectual potential, navigate the complex social scene, and deal with any challenges they might encounter.”In the selection process for a new resident dean, undergraduate residents of Cabot were consulted to narrow down the field of applicants. Though the two final candidates were “extremely qualified,” Constantino’s personality ultimately “shone” and tipped the scale in her favor, according to Melissa Hoyos ’10, who served on the selection committee.“I think the resident dean really needs to reach out to each and every student. I think Jill really has a fantastic ability to do that,” said Thomas J. Barnet-Lamb, a Cabot resident tutor. “She seems to put everyone at ease and really connects with many different people.”The position of Cabot writing tutor—which Constantino held for the past two years—has allowed her to interact with students at a level of intimacy indicative of a direct investment in student welfare, according to Hoyos. A vibrant presence who forged personal connections with students during late night office hours in the dining hall, Constantino “went above and beyond the call of duty,” said resident tutor David Johnston.“I presume that she’ll bring that same energy to the position [of Resident Dean],” he added. “She’s a very active presence in the House.”Her already entrenched roots in the House may promise stability for a position that has been characterized in recent years by a series of turnovers. “I think the appointment was made with the hope that she’ll mesh with the Cabot community and stay around for a long time,” Johnston said.Constantino—as well as her two children, fellow dining hall regulars—has already attained high visibility in Cabot even before assuming her new post, according to Hoyos. Such ties to House culture suggest that Constantino will be a strong advocate for students before the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body and an area of responsibility for the position of resident dean, Hoyos added.Though Hoyos said she personally had positive interactions with Mangawang, she acknowledged that others lodged criticism against the former resident dean for her less-than-enthusiastic support for students in Ad Board dealings.Constantino assumed her post as a non-residential tutor in writing two years ago and moved into Cabot with her family last July. The Ph.D. in anthropology will teach in the department next year, in addition to resuming her duties as a preceptor in expository writing.“I love to be intellectually challenged and to figure out the way this world works,” Constantino said. “I strive to keep things balanced, not take myself too seriously, and to find joy in the steps toward my goals.”—Staff writer Bita M.

In a move that has delighted many of her colleagues and former students, the University has granted Professor Glenda R. Carpio tenure in both the English and African and African American Studies departments.“I’m extremely happy both for her and for the College because I think it’s only in the best interest of the students that we’ll be able to take classes with her and we’ll be able to be exposed to her mind and her enthusiasm for the material,” said former student and thesis advisee Andrew C. Coles ’09. Carpio arrived at Harvard in 2002, following the widely-publicized departure of African American studies Professors K. Anthony Appiaha and Cornel R. West ’74 for Princeton the previous year. She quickly built a reputation as a student favorite, both for her engaging lectures and her accessibility to undergraduates outside the classroom. Carpio’s colleagues and teaching fellows described her as warm and sensitive. “I’ve noticed that students who have taken one class with her often go back for a second class, or will ask her to direct their senior theses,” said Professor Daniel G. Donoghue, director of undergraduate studies for the English department. “She seems to make strong connections.” Coles echoed this sentiment, saying he often visited Carpio to discuss the non-academic side of his life—and she was always willing to listen. “She is so committed to every student that she has,” Coles said. “She wants to see you succeed in everything that you do.”Carpio also possesses a gift for navigating difficult topics in the classroom, said Christina A. Knight, a graduate student who served as a teaching fellow for Carpio’s class African and African American Studies 112: “Black Humor.”“She manages to keep the richness of humor as a topic of study, but also manages to keep the humor going as something fun,” Knight said.Knight added that Carpio was extremely careful to respect the complex dynamics of race in her classroom.Sabrina Sadique, another of Carpio’s TFs, also emphasized Carpio’s unique approach to classroom participation as a teaching strength. Sadique said that Carpio often spends the first 20-25 minutes of an hour-long class lecturing on a text and then opens the floor for discussion among her students. For students used to only talking in section, this is a welcome surprise, said Sadique. Carpio has also been involved in several students groups in her time at Harvard. She has served as the faculty advisor both for Black Community and Student Theater, a campus theater group that produces the works of African-American playwrights, and Fuerza Latina, an undergraduate organization that provides support for Harvard’s Latino students. These organizations reflect her own diversity, as she is a Guatemalan-born Latina woman who teaches both the English language and African-American history for her profession.“I would say that she reminds us how futile it is to categorize people by the convenient labels that we throw around,” Donoghue said.—Staff writer Evan T.

Ernest R. May, a genial professor who  led Harvard College with collectedness and a sense of diplomacy and stood at the forefront of the study of U.S. foreign relations over his 55 years at Harvard, died Monday from complications following surgery. He was 80.May left his mark on the University, filling a wide array of roles, including dean of the College, associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and director of the Institute of Politics. “There are a small number of people at Harvard who really step up through genuine belief in the institution and the people in it, and Ernest May was one of them,” said Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood.As dean of the College from 1969 to 1971, May shepherded the College through tumultuous times that included a reexamination of undergraduate education and the 1969 occupation of University Hall, in which about 100 members of Students for a Democratic Society trapped May in his office while advocating for changes to the University’s labor policy.A diplomatic leader, May spoke with the students for over an hour before attempting to leave.“He performed nobly,” said former Harvard professor James Q. Wilson, the chair of the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities, which dealt with the disciplinary action stemming from the situation. “He didn’t yield to excessive student demands, but he was perfectly willing to talk to them.”As both a professor and an administrator, May was calm and thoughtful, yet genial in his interactions with others. “He would rarely say 10 words when he could make his point in eight,” Zelikow said.A native of Fort Worth, Texas, May ventured westward to UCLA for his undergraduate and graduate degrees before spending the Korean War working as an historian for the U.S. Joints Chiefs of Staff. In 1954, he arrived in Cambridge, where he would spend the rest of his professional life.As a young professor, May was known for his rhetorical talent and relaxed, accessible style. “He came to class with a scrap of paper, no formal lecture notes,” said Akira Iriye, May’s former student and colleague in the History Department. “He just simply went on talking without interruption. That was just overwhelming.” Iriye first worked with May in 1957, when Iriye came to Harvard as a graduate student. May eventually became his dissertation advisor. As an international student from Japan, Iriye said he sometimes struggled with writing in English, but May spent dozens of hours poring over Iriye’s dissertation line by line with his foreign pupil and even helped him write his conclusion when Iriye found himself pressed to finish by his deadline. Philip D. Zelikow—a student of May’s over 20 years after Iriye—said that while May’s lectures were “not flamboyant,” he was a “thoughtful and witty” instructor. “He was very interested in challenging students to think a little harder about the material,” Zelikow said. “He was less interested in selling a point of view than getting you to think.”Both Iriye and Zelikow later joined Harvard’s History department and co-taught classes with May. Iriye said that as a colleague, he was “not pompous” and treated him more like a younger brother than a junior faculty member.As a noted foreign policy scholar, May helped expand the field beyond its narrow focus on the bureaucrats involved in diplomatic relations, examining the role domestic politics and public opinion play in international relations, Iriye said.May—who spoke a variety of languages ranging from German to Spanish to Russian—also made a point to delve into foreign countries’ diplomatic papers in hopes of achieving a better understanding of their viewpoints.Throughout his career, May was also noted for using history to inform public policy. Ellwood said May was particularly skilled at recognizing when to look to historical circumstances for guidance and when the circumstances dictated a different approach.After leaving his post as dean of the College, May spent three years as the director of the IOP, which he later matched with three years as the History department’s chair.May also served on the Kennedy School’s faculty and was a member of the board of directors of the school’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.In recent years, he served as an advisor to the 9/11 Commission—which Zelikow said he led as executive director at May’s urging. Outside of the academic realm, May was an avid tennis player, a sport which he and Wilson picked up together. May also participated for many years in a monthly poker club comprised of Harvard colleagues. “He was a man of much calmness, good judgement, and great humor, a bad tennis player, good poker player, and a great dean,” said Wilson, May’s close friend and former colleague.Iriye said that May will be remembered as “a man of his word” who was interested in the opinions of his students and colleagues, regardless of their age or position.“As far as I know, there is not a single person who knows him who would be considered his enemy,” Zelikow said, “and that’s a rare thing.”—Staff writer Lauren D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Family and public service are two points in the same continuum, newly-confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen G. Sebelius told the soon-to-be graduates of the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday.
The Secretary described the role of her own father, a former governor of Ohio, in teaching her that it was “more important to do something than to be something.” 
Her address also emphasized the importance of “moral courage,” a value Sebelius said was also lauded by one of her heroes, Robert F. Kennedy. 
Her address touched on the recent outbreak of H1N1 virus—a matter that her office must grapple with—noting that the disease was spreading from North America to the rest of the world and that HKS students’ expertise and insight are needed to combat this and other problems.
“The meeting of minds here has given you the tools to navigate almost any circumstance,” she told the assembly.
Sebelius urged the audience to remember Kennedy’s famous “ripples of hope” speech, in which he described the cumulative impact of all varieties of public service.
Students and their parents called Sebelius’s speech inspirational, adding that her description of her path to HHS gave them perspective on their own futures.
“I especially liked that she said you don’t need a high title or an office to serve,” said Charles Reichel, whose daughter Carlyn graduates today.
“I like it when a speaker thinks about her audience during a speech,” said Christina N. Peterson, whose daughter will earn a Masters in Public Policy this year.
“This was an audience of families, and she talked about the role of family in a lifetime of service,” Peterson added.
Dozens of flags hung from the walls of the Forum, each representing the home nation of at least one of this year’s Kennedy School graduates. 
Ryutaro Murotami, a Japanese student who will receive a Masters in Public Policy said that he had been concerned that Sebelius would not properly reflect the school’s international character.
“I was reluctant to have someone from domestic politics, but it was a very comprehensive speech,” said Murotami, who said he will return to working at a Japanese government aid agency, a job he held prior to attending HKS.
Sebelius was introduced by her son, Edward K. Sebelius, who graduates from the Kennedy School today, and who drew laughs from the audience by recalling that his mother’s political successes had frequently coincided with his own academic achievements.
Sebelius is a Democrat who was twice elected governor of Kansas, a heavily Republican state. She helped draft a national bill of patients rights, and was described by HKS Dean David T. Elwood as “a pro-business democrat.”
She was confirmed as HHS secretary in April.

Striking a balance between humor and substance, Matt Lauer of NBC’s Today Show addressed the Class of 2009 during yesterday’s Class Day Exercises.
Class Day, the day before Harvard College seniors graduate, was a well-received, light-hearted affair, members of the audience said.
The event took place in Tercentenary Theatre, where two student speakers who gave the customary “Ivy Orations” had the audience in stitches.
Lauer began his remarks with several anecdotes that drew laughs, joking about when he told his high school guidance counselor that he wanted to apply to Harvard “as a stretch.” 
According to Lauer, the counselor replied, “Mr. Lauer you applying to Harvard would be the biggest waste of 15 dollars in the history of 15 dollars.” 
“You are, despite the kidding here, the best and the brightest,” Lauer said, adding that the class had much of their lives before them. “You are also the object of my enormous jealousy.” 
Humor set the rest of the address’ tone as well, with Lauer including one story ending with his young son picking his nose ten feet away from President Barack Obama. 
Lauer said the graduating seniors would get their fill of sober remarks during today’s speeches.
“You’ve got the Secretary of Energy Steven Chu as your speaker tomorrow, sexy,” he said. “Unless he gives each and every one of you those nitrogen fuel cell cars, you are in for a long afternoon.” 
He also delivered some customary advice, suggesting that those in attendance make sure to have children and to find someone in their lives who “could look [them] in the eye and tell [them] the truth, every single time.”
Rufus D. Stephens, who came to see a family friend graduate, said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the quality of speakers.
“I thought Matt was great,” he said.
Lumumba B. Seegars ’09, the senior class’ first marshal, opened and closed the event with a speaking style that came from his time preaching at his church while in high school, according to his roommate Matthew K. Clair ’09.
Seegars completed his remarks with an a cappella rendition of “Lean on Me.”
“He loves the Class of 2009,” Clair said. “It all came from the heart.”
William J. Houghteling ’09 gave an Ivy Oration titled “Bull Markets Come and Go, Snobbery is Forever.”
His speech moved from one laugh to another, focusing on the job market seniors will be graduating into today.
“We are the most intelligent, accomplished, and unemployed class to graduate from Harvard,” he said.
But he said, despite even the harshest economic conditions, Harvard will always be around. 
“Harvard is an indestructible American brand—like Lehman Brothers and General Motors,” he quipped.
He concluded his remarks saying, “Congratulations Class of 2009. We are literally the most amazing people ever.”
To some in attendance, the speeches provided insight about time at Harvard. Jill Schoenfeld, who will be a member of the class of 2013, came to see her sister graduate today.
“As an incoming freshmen, [the speakers] were very inspiring,” she said.

Harvard will announce the first endowed professorship in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender studies in the country at a dinner after Commencement activities.
The University has received $1.5 million from the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Caucus to endow the F.O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality—a position to be filled by visiting scholars in LGBT issues for one semester in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The creation of the professorship marks a singular moment in Harvard’s history with respect to LGBT studies. As recently as 2003, Women’s Studies was refashioned to become the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, which allows students to choose between the tracks of LGBT studies or women’s studies. Though universities across the country have instituted similar programs and coursework in the field, the Matthiessen professorship is the first actual endowed position.
“Plenty of universities hire professors [in the field], but an endowed professorship is a statement by the University that this is an important program,” said Caucus member Thomas H. Parry ’74, who helped initiate the campaign to raise money for the cause.
“It’s important for kids who are gay that the University acknowledges, recognizes, takes seriously this field,” Parry added. “It’s important that non-gay kids recognize that homosexuality and sexual minorities are an important part of the human condition.”
Upon the 2003 reformulation of WGS, leaders of the Caucus—a 4,900-member group that works to advocate for Harvard’s LGBT community—decided that it could support the new program by endowing a visiting professorship, according to Parry. 
With the realization of this goal, Harvard will be able to invite visiting scholars that focus on varying facets of the interdisciplinary field of LGBT studies, instead of appointing a full professor of more narrow expertise, he said.
“It’s really important that we have a regular and ongoing opportunity for students to learn about and explore LGBT issues,” said Susan B. Marine, director of the Women’s Center, “including history, philosophy, theory, and what’s going on in the LGBT rights movement.”
The professorship—named after former English professor Francis O. Matthiessen, whose homosexuality was an open secret during his time at Harvard—marks a step forward in the larger movement seeking to legitimize fields like LGBT studies, according to Timothy P. McCarthy, a lecturer in public policy and in history and literature.
“I’m thrilled personally, as a gay scholar, to see that Harvard is making a big leap in terms of being able to show an even greater commitment to LGBT studies,” McCarthy said. “It’s the exciting culmination of a longer struggle to gain legitimacy for the study of LGBT people.”
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith will ask faculty members to recommend candidates for the professorship every year, according to Parry. Though selected scholars will be associated with WGS, they may be appointed in any FAS department.
Led by co-chairs Mitchell L. Adams ’66 and Kevin B. Jennings ’85, the Matthiessen Campaign Committee reached its funding goal by collecting gifts from Harvard affiliates and the Open Gate Foundation, a private foundation created by HGLC in 1987.
Though Harvard may be the first University to officially have an endowed professorship in LGBT studies, AIDS activist Larry Kramer offered an endowed chair in gay studies to Yale in the late 1990s—an offer Yale rejected, instead later accepting money from Kramer’s brother to help fund a gay and lesbian studies program.

Harvard University Health Services is suggesting that the Harvard community forgo “the traditional handshakes and embraces that accompany graduation ceremonies” in light of a recent uptick in the number of students presenting flu symptoms.Donna Campbell, a UHS nurse practitioner and infection control surveillance officer, said that while there have been no recently-confirmed H1N1—“swine flu”—cases at Harvard, “you make a presumptive diagnosis based on symptoms.” She said she could not give a precise number for the increase in sickness this past week, noting that diagnoses for illnesses can change. But she also said that UHS is not testing patients for the H1N1 strain of the flu unless they present with complications or are considered at high-risk, in accordance with recommendations from the Mass. Public Health Commission. A May 22 update on H1N1 testing guidelines issued by the Mass. Department of Public Health suggested that “individuals with mild illness should be advised to stay at home.”The University’s announcement comes weeks after several now-confirmed cases of H1N1 occurred at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, which prompted University and Boston health authorities to temporarily suspend classes at Harvard’s Longwood medical campus and close the dental school’s treatment clinic. High absenteeism and a rash of cases around Boston in recent weeks has also forced the closing of several public and private schools.“Traditionally we don’t see this much influenza-like illness this late in the year,” Campbell said, noting that the traditional flu season runs from roughly October through April.H1N1 presents symptoms similar to any other influenza virus, including sore throat, fever, cough, and stuffy nose and is usually tempered by rest and fluids. But because the strain is new, people will likely not have immunity, making symptoms more severe. Campbell said that the illness is not “particularly serious” for the young and healthy, and according to the UHS Web site, those at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and adults and children with immunosuppression or certain chronic disorders.She said that the recent rash of illness was likely caused by increased person-to-person contact during the graduation period and noted that the patients presenting themselves for treatment have mostly been students and not alumni or other visitors.“Anytime you have any activity going on where people are close, you increase the risk of illness,” Campbell said. “All the seniors are on top of each other with everybody saying goodbye, and there are oodles of social events where people are in close proximity.”—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

General David H. Petraeus, chief of U.S. military operations in much of the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Middle East, lauded the importance of “individual leaders” in a speech at the ROTC Commissioning Ceremony in Tercentenary Theatre yesterday.After beginning his speech on a comedic note, Petraeus encouraged “what must be the smartest new members of our military” to make use of the leadership skills they had developed through their training. He also implored them to follow “five critical admonitions”: “lead by example,” “be humble,” “don’t hesitate to make decisions,” “be a team player and a team builder,” and “don’t take yourself too seriously, but do take your work seriously.”Petraeus—whose remarks were part of a ceremony following the commissioning of four seniors into the Army and three into the Marine Corps—was hailed as a “soldier scholar” by University President Drew G. Faust, who spoke before Petraeus.Faust also gave the moniker to the seven newly-commissioned officers and one graduate student to be commissioned in the fall, telling them that as such, their role is to “never let the military or society forget the big picture.”Class of 1959 speaker Darnell M. Whitt ’59 also described Petraeus as a “soldier scholar,” adding that Faust is similar to Petraeus in that she is “a scholar who has written a lot about soldiers.”Faust prefaced her comments with the announcement that Harvard will join the GI Bill Yellow Ribbon Education Program next fall, which will provide substantial financial assistance for up to 150 military veterans to attend Harvard College, the Extension School, or one of Harvard’s graduate schools. The tuition assistance provided by Harvard will be matched by the federal government. ROTC has not been welcome at Harvard since 1969, when it was expelled from campus following student demonstrations against the Vietnam War. Currently, Harvard students who participate in ROTC train at MIT. Unlike last year, when Faust criticized the military’s policy of “don’t ask, don’t tell”—which bars openly gay people from service and has been cited in recent years as the reason ROTC remains off campus—Faust did not comment on the controversial policy yesterday.But Whitt did touch on the current absence of ROTC on campus and the reasons behind it, recalling his 1959 Harvard ROTC class of 121 students. He encouraged both Harvard and Congress to seek a compromise on the issue.“I hope the current issues of military matters at Harvard will be resolved and there will be a close connection between Harvard and those in uniform,” Whitt said.—Staff writer Lauren D.

Some Quadlings who subscribe to AT&T and suffer from poor cell phone reception may soon find it easier to communicate.According to an e-mail from Associate Dean of Residential Life Suzy M. Nelson to Quad House Masters obtained by The Crimson, a team assembled to address cell phone reception problems in the Quad has agreed with AT&T to install a temporary and later a permanent antenna beginning as early as August, pending approval from the City of Cambridge.The approval process for a permanent antenna could be completed in six to nine months, and the antenna would be placed on top of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, said Undergraduate Council representative George J.J. Hayward ’11, who said he has worked for several months to improve cell phone reception in the Quad.Harvard administrators have concluded that installing an antenna would not detract aesthetically from the Quad area, the message said, since all equipment would be “blended” into existing buildings and would not be obtrusive to a “casual observer.”Nelson wrote in the message that the team “does not anticipate major delays” and expects to have a fully functional permanent antenna in place by the summer of 2010.In the meantime, a cell on wheels (COW)—a van containing signal transmission and reception equipment—could be moved into place by August, also contingent on the completion of a two to three month permit application process by AT&T and approval from the City of Cambridge. COWs are frequently used to provide backup cell phone coverage when storms or other natural disasters have knocked out existing infrastructure.The issue of cell phone reception was taken up by students as early as 2005 and has adopted additional importance recently after some Quad residents reported not receiving emergency text message notifications about the shooting in Kirkland House last month. Many students who use service providers other than Verizon have reported reception problems, said several Quad residents in the past.Hayward, a resident of Currier House, said he has received over 300 messages from Quad residents about the cell phone reception problem since last fall. He complimented the University’s willingness to address this issue, which he made a focus of his UC election campaign at the time.“Right now, we are working together.“ Hayward said. “In the beginning we had to demonstrate substantial student concern, but now we are on the same page.”It is not yet known whether service providers Sprint and T-Mobile will also collaborate with Harvard to improve the reception quality on their networks in the Quad.—Staff writer Laura G.

Despite recent chatter that the University plans on instituting mass layoffs later this month—after the conclusion of Commencement activities—both a union leader at Harvard and a University spokesman say that negotiations about staff reductions remain in the early stages, making any discussions of a timeline premature.“The persistent rumors out there [are] based on the mythology that the University is one big coordinated entity and that some Harvard office is the keeper of the list of people to be laid off,” said Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the University’s largest union. “Our experience is that both of those impressions are blatantly wrong.”He added that schools and departments around the University have only begun requesting meetings with the union this past week. Under the union’s negotiated contract, Harvard is required to notify and consult with the union before conducting any layoffs in order to allow the union to propose alternatives to job cuts, Jaeger said.Similarly, University spokesman Kevin Galvin said that while Harvard will likely “have to make further changes to the size of its workforce” in the face of an unprecedented fiscal crisis, discussions with union partners are still underway, making it “premature” to determine when such changes to staff positions might occur.Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said in April that the administration would not announce any plans for layoffs before the summer, but beyond that, the University has not released any timeline. Rumors about prospective job cuts have offered dates ranging from June 10 to the end of the month.With layoffs looming, some have continued to rally on behalf of staff. Kimberly Theidon, an associate professor of anthropology, has proposed the “1% Campaign,” which calls for a voluntary 1 percent faculty pay cut to help stave off staff layoffs. She said that she has witnessed “overwhelming willingness” to participate among faculty.But according to FAS spokesman Robert P. Mitchell, the institution of even an across-the-board 2 percent salary reduction for non-union workers would have only a “minor impact,” saving less than $5 million—only a fraction of the $143 million that remains to be cut.“Those who enjoy great privileges also have great responsibilities, and that means making great sacrifices for the common good when circumstances require it,” wrote public policy and history and literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy in an e-mailed statement last month in support of voluntary paycuts among faculty. “This is one of those circumstances.”“We are a community here at Harvard—or at least we should be—and now is the time for all of us to act like it,” McCarthy added.—Staff writer Esther I.

U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan introduced herself as just a “fellow graduate” upon her return to Harvard Law School yesterday, where she served as dean from 2003 until her Senate confirmation in March, As dean, Kagan built a legacy of student-oriented reform initiatives, As the Law School’s class day speaker, she placed the final seal on her deanship and urged the graduating class to seize the opportunities that have arisen from the economic recession. In her speech, Kagan offered career advice to a Law School class whose job searches were hit hard by the troubles on Wall Street—where many prestigious law firms have traditionally generated business—and whose attentions have increasingly turned to public service.“I know some of you might have thought in the last year or so, you and this class sort of drew the short straw,” said Kagan, who graduated from the Law School in 1986. “But within all this difficulty there is also incredible potential and promise, and yours is the task of finding that promise by remaking the world.”Law School students have often been too risk-averse or too unwilling to take chances in the past, Kagan said—especially in a past when major law firms offered job security and six-figure salaries. As a result, the economic turmoil might have the beneficial side-effect of causing graduates to think through what career choices would be most fulfilling, she said.Kagan extended two other pieces of tried and true advice to the degree candidates—to cultivate personal relationships, and to learn to listen to others in addition to simply arguing with them.“Nobody ever learned anything when they’re talking,” Kagan said. “You only learn something when your ears are open, not when your mouth is open.”One Law School graduate said he was somewhat underwhelmed by the former dean’s remarks, as even she acknowledged that being the final speaker at yesterday’s class day ceremony meant repeating the sentiments of earlier speakers.“I was expecting something more original, especially coming from her,” said Olivier J. Metzger, a master of laws candidate.But many graduates said they were happy to see Kagan take part in the ceremonies marking their last days as Law School students. Juelle J. Gomes, who will receive a J.D., called the sight of Kagan behind the podium a “nostalgic” moment.“She was such a presence around the Law School and really did so much to enrich student life,” Gomes said. “They couldn’t have picked a better speaker.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chief Executive and Chairman of JPMorgan Chase Jamie L. Dimon spoke before the 900 graduating students of the Harvard Business School yesterday as part of HBS’ Class Day festivities. Both Dimon and student speaker Thomas C. Rajan struck melancholy tones in their remarks, emphasizing the need for greater reflection and responsibility among business executives in the current economic climate. The event was held on Baker Lawn in the afternoon, and light rain periodically fell as students and their families gathered to honor HBS professors, present the class gift, and celebrate the conclusion of their studies. Following brief remarks by Dean Jay O. Light, student Deirdre-Ann L. Perry introduced the concept of Class Day, saying it was “designed by the students, for the students.”Perry also introduced Rajan’s speech, noting that he was selected from more than 25 applicants who presented their speeches in two rounds of competition. When Rajan took the podium, he began with a series of jokes, but his remarks quickly grew more serious. Rajan emphasized the ways in which many have lost faith in the business community due to the financial crisis. He added that despite this, students could use their knowledge and experience to help improve the world. Rajan noted that more than 400 students had signed up to recite an oath affirming their commitment to integrity and accountability in business practice after the Class Day ceremony.“May we give more of ourselves to our communities, to our workplaces, to our families,” Rajan said. “Let it go forth from this time that we are a class that is ready to serve.”Dimon also began his remarks with a touch of humor, joking “I just want to make it absolutely clear that I was at Citigroup 10 years ago,” referencing the financial services company that had to be bailed out by the federal government last year.His speech included a mix of practical career advice and reflections upon what it means to be a responsible and ethical business leader.He encouraged the graduating students to be true to themselves, to cut across hierarchies in their business relationships, and, most of all, to exercise humility.  “If you want to be a leader it can’t be about money and it can’t be about you,” Dimon said.He concluded by encouraging the students to try to use their business careers to help make a better world. Rajan and Dimon both received standing ovations, and students seemed pleased with both speakers. Student Prashanth H. Ambekar said he was impressed with Dimon’s remarks, but that Rajan’s were ultimately more inspiring. “I had very high expectations, but I was very happy with my class day speaker, and I think that made up for it,” Ambekar said. —Staff writer Evan T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been called the jewel of Harvard College, an arrangement of inter-generational residential living that has been a facet of the undergraduate experience since the 1930s. The College’s House system—a set of 12 residences spanning Dewolfe to Garden Streets, and potentially the Charles River into neighboring Allston one day—are a hub of both academic and social activity. Tenured faculty sit at the helm, supported by contingents of alumni and affiliates from varying generations and trades, all intermingling with a few hundred undergraduates. 
First translated into reality by President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, class of 1877, successive administrations have scrutinized the House system over the years to keep with Harvard’s aim of “forging a link between learning and living,” according to the Office of Residential Life’s Web site.
Most recently, the Report on Harvard House Renewal, released by College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds this April 1, attempted to reassess the realization of this goal as the University prepares to embark on a $1 billion renovation effort—the first such large-scale review of House life since 1969, says Associate Dean of Residential Life Suzy M. Nelson.
The renewal process, announced slightly over a year ago, is set to occur in three stages: the first, culminating in the Renewal Report, highlighted areas of House life requiring improvement; the second, now underway, will develop renovation blueprints; and the third will encompass construction—currently slated to begin in 2012. 
In the report, the College administration seeks “to explore the unique role and purpose of House life in the educational experience of Harvard and to revitalize the House system for the 21st century,” maintaining that, “in these challenging economic times, we are committed to this essential undertaking.” 
But this long-standing tradition has not been immune from the unprecedented fiscal crisis that is projected to cost Harvard nearly a third of its $36.9-billion endowment. 
And as University-wide cuts reach the Houses—from the elimination of hot breakfast to the possible trimming of shuttle service—House administrators, students, and generations of residents are questioning whether their Houses can endure cost-cutting measures without undercutting Lowell’s vision.
A VISION OF HOUSE LIFE
In dozens of interviews last week, students and House staff noted the conflict between spending significant funds to improve House infrastructure and complying with the mandated scaling-back in House expenditures.  
Over the last year, some of the people involved in the Committee on House Life synthesized research obtained from focus groups, five House Program Planning Subcommittees, and student surveys. Chief among their findings, Nelson says, was that the Houses needed to be modernized—and not merely with cosmetic improvements like fresh coats of paint, but rather with extensive interior renovations like replacing internal plumbing.
Still, a balance between House renovation and House history needed to be reached, Nelson says. To that end, the report concludes that preserving the “historic mystique of a Harvard building” must be coupled with the more practical concerns gleaned from the CHL’s focus groups and surveys, in which students asked for basic improvements such as better lighting and heating, increased privacy, and greater sound-proofing.
For Cullen McAlpine ’11, renovations could not come soon enough. Though the sophomore says that he and his roommates enjoyed a spacious Dunster room last year, friends of his lived in an “inefficient, uncomfortable” room that featured two small singles with a walk-through bathroom.
“I’m really looking forward to the renovations, especially in Dunster,” Alpine says, referencing overcrowding that often characterizes residences. “Hopefully, they’ll redesign some of these walk-throughs.”
Even though the College has stabilized the undergraduate population size by freezing transfer admissions, a growing number of students over the last century has rendered current House capacity insufficient.
To combat shortfalls in space and size, the Renewal Report recommends maximizing the number of private bedrooms, reducing the prevalence of suites housing more than five students, and eliminating large group hallway bathrooms. 
But some of the renovations are primarily intended to ensure student safety—not just comfort. Currently, several Houses are undergoing the installation of sprinkler systems.
And as illustrated by the sprawling nature of the 112-page report and its $1 billion price tag, the House renewal initiative is ambitious both in its scope and its bottom line.
ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK?
According to Nelson, the release of the report coincided with stage two of House Renewal: design and development, a phase that entails drafting architectural blueprints for the ideal upperclassman House.
The College administration says that construction is slated to begin in 2012—less than three years from now, and already one year behind the initial 2011 estimate.  
But in recent weeks, some administrators—including Nelson and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith—have qualified the 2012 projected start date by calling it “the earliest possible” deadline.
Standing in the way of a 2012 start is the question of where to house students during construction. As of last week, over a year after the need for interim housing became apparent, Nelson said no swing space facilities had been identified.
Amid a deepening recession, however, prioritizing House expansion has been viewed skeptically—especially in light of recent cuts in the Houses.
“Plans for expansion have been overshadowed,” says Otto F. Coontz, assistant to the Adams House resident dean, adding that students have instead been primarily concerned with pending cuts that they say “tamper” with the current House system. 
These reductions have been the product of planning for increasingly large budget cuts in the Houses. Earlier this semester, the College administration asked House Masters to model a one-percent budget cut as an exercise. But as the fiscal climate worsened, the exercise became more of a reality.
By April, the administration was asking House Masters to submit budgets to accommodate a 25-percent reduction, which led both House administrators and students to voice concern over slashing a quarter of an already sparse budget.
“We were not willing to accept the consequences of a 25-percent cut,” says Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, who added that his most recent budget submission modeled a cut between 15 and 20 percent. “Just as the Dean has categories that absolutely cannot be touched, we are in the same situation. But the Houses have much less flexibility.” 
THE COST OF CUTS
Over the course of last semester, the Houses have felt the impact of budget trimming in five main areas: the Senior Common Room, House libraries, shuttle services, hot breakfast, and House staff.
Some of these cuts—particularly those to the SCR—were initiated at the House level.
While the Renewal Report acknowledges that the SCR presently falls short of its goal of fostering “meaningful” interactions among faculty, students, and alumni, and recommends bolstering the presence of SCR members in House communities, House Masters targeted SCR expenses for budget reductions.
Both Eliot House Master Lino Pertile and Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck say they plan to significantly cut back the meal plan granted to SCR members, who include alumni and faculty. Still, both Masters say that the move could decrease SCR members’ visibility further among students.
“It makes a difference to have a House community that is not just students,” Eck says, referencing the inter-generational nature of the SCR. “Go to BU or someplace like that if you just want to live and be around students.” 
Other cuts came as top-down proposals from the College administration. House administrators and students alike forcefully opposed one such proposal: the College’s attempt, made in mid-May, to scale back shuttle service.   
Incoming Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis says he was “unhappy” with potentially terminating 1:30 a.m. shuttle service to the Quad next year from Sunday to Wednesday; this year, shuttle service ended at 3:45 a.m.
“This type of cut specifically disadvantages the Quad,” says Christakis, who along with his wife will inherit a budget finalized by his predecessors, James J. and Sue McCarthy. He adds that he was concerned that Quad residents will also have to contend with the closure of the Quad library next year, another cut announced in early May. 
Library cutbacks are not confined to the Quad. Already in some Houses, students who are not eligible for federal work-study benefits have been left without jobs in House libraries. In an effort to comply with mandated budget cuts, several House Masters have decided to limit library hours and staff.
According to Kirkland House librarian Allison K. Rone ’06, the House can no longer afford to accommodate as many undergraduates who would have to be paid out of already-stretched House funds. 
The College administration’s decision to eliminate hot breakfast on weekdays in the Houses also met with student opposition. Over House e-mail lists, students protested the adverse health effects of not eating breakfast, especially for athletes who rely on calorie-filled morning meals. 
But the Renewal Report had already foreshadowed the possibility of reducing the scope of early-morning meal offerings.
“Maintaining 12 upperclass dining halls is financially difficult,” the report reads, and adds that the College should “explore the possibility of having breakfast in only one dining hall per neighborhood.”
But the administration went beyond the report’s initial recommendations. Noting that about a third of undergraduates eat breakfast and the University would save $900,000 as a result of the cut, the administration decided to keep only Annenberg open for hot breakfast during weekdays next year. 
Brianne M. Farrar ’10, a resident of Lowell House, says she was “personally mad” about the reductions to hot breakfast because she usually looks “forward to eating eggs every morning.” 
AN ‘INTEGRAL’ CATEGORY 
According to House Masters, one of the most “integral” areas of House life is their staff. Recently, College administrators have flirted with the idea of scaling back key positions in the Houses. The Crimson reported this proposal in early May, but House officials say that the administration has been eyeing such cuts for much of this semester. 
The Renewal Report cites the centrality of one such position: the assistant to the resident dean. These individuals are charged with several administrative tasks, including maintaining an average of 400 student files for current undergraduate residents and sending letters of recommendation for students applying to graduate, medical, or law schools.
In fact, the report suggests “upgrading” this position, expanding the assistant’s responsibilities to include advising undergraduates, and easing some of the administrative duties of House Masters.
“In all,” the report reads, “any changes should assume that the strength of any House staffing model is built on a team effort.”
But nearly a month after the report’s release, the College administration proposed consolidating the resident dean’s assistant position, having one assistant assume administrative responsibilities for two to three Houses. 
Both House Masters and students vocally opposed the potential move. During meetings with faculty and College administrators, Eck emphasized the fact that while House staff has not expanded in the last decade, 230 additional administrative staff across FAS have been added to the University payroll. 
“This goes against the notion of a House. It would force [the assistants’] loyalties to be divided,” Pertile says. “With no loyalties, it is almost like saying that a machine would be sufficient.”
Students—who rely on resident deans’ assistants for “anything from recommendations to fellowships to jobs,” says Adams resident John M. Mistovic ’09—echoed this sentiment.  
“I think that Otto is vital to the functioning of our House,” Mistovic says. “It would fall apart...I couldn’t imagine Adams House without him.”
Altogether, students and some House administrators say that certain cost-cutting measures—whether initiated by College or by House officials—will change the nature of House life. Moreover, they add that these changes seemingly undercut the rhetoric of both the Renewal Report and the foundation of House life as articulated by President Lowell more than seven decades ago.
FUTURE IN FLUX
As of last Thursday, when House Masters met for the final time this academic year, budgets for the coming year had still not been finalized. Eck expressed doubt that House budgets would be formally approved before the July 1 start date of the next fiscal year.
Since budgets are still uncertain, most Masters remained hopeful that changes to House life would be minimal and said they would oppose implementing a 25-percent budget cut if that were to become a formal mandate. Losing a quarter of House funds would “drastically affect daily life in practice,” Pertile says.
“Certainly if we have to cut one open house out of four, or one study break, or one major House dinner out of four, I think the quality of life for students would no doubt be impoverished,” he adds. 
Whether or not some of the more intangible elements of House life—including House spirit and culture—would be compromised in the process remains to be seen, says incoming Winthrop House Master Ronald S. Sullivan, who was selected in February as the first black faculty member to hold the post.
“I hope that House spirit won’t be impacted, as the Houses play such a central role in the University,” he says. “But I’m confident that we can maintain the House’s ‘espirit de corps.’”
But many students were less optimistic, expressing concern about ramifications of budget cuts, which they say were drafted without student consultation. 
“I think in a way the University is behaving like a corporation, figuring out where it can make cuts,” says Kevin J. Davies ’10, a Quincy House resident. “But that’s not how it should be acting. The University has a responsibility to include students in the decisions it’s making, keeping in mind that we are paying tuition and we make Harvard what it is... The University seems like it doesn’t care about students, which is a shame.”
With next year’s budget still in flux and the University’s financial situation bleak, administrators say they have been put in a tough situation—having to cut back on House life while simultaneously promising to bolster it.
“We might have some short-term needs based on our fiscal climate that we absolutely have to address,” Nelson says. “But we have long-term commitments to the Houses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Studying Telugu. Exploring culinary tradition. Visiting Emily Dickinson’s home in western Massachusetts.These were among the program ideas suggested by a 2005 committee to fill a new three-week January term left open by a 2004 proposal to create one University-wide calendar, a schedule later adopted by Interim University President Derek Bok in 2007 for implementation in the 2009-2010 academic year.But four years later, these opportunities remain unrealized. Instead, the College’s first J-Term next winter will feature limited housing for select individuals, encouraging students to explore off-campus options and to use the period for rest and relaxation.The January programming once expected from calendar change has been overshadowed, as administrators reassess the College’s financial priorities in light of economic turmoil and prioritize what they consider more critical elements of the undergraduate experience, such as General Education. In the four years since planning commenced, J-Term plans were allowed to fall by the wayside, as administrative and later financial turmoil forced the College and University to adjust their priorities.A BLUEPRINT WITHOUT BACKINGBefore the decision to adopt a University-wide academic schedule, a number of Harvard’s graduate schools—including the Kennedy School, Medical School, and School of Public Heath—already included a J-Term in their calendars.  After six months of consideration, Verba’s committee recommended that the entire University convert to a calendar of two four-month semesters separated by a one-month break.The report suggested that each of Harvard’s schools determine “how, or whether, they wish to use the January time period based on their curricular needs.” Verba says that his calendar reform committee acknowledged that substantial resources would need to be devoted to making J-Term programming a reality. “If formal programming was to be a success, a lot of resources had to be devoted to it,” says former Harvard professor Lisa L. Martin, a co-chair of a committee focused on J-Term during the time of curricular review. “But this never happened.”Though the Conley report suggested that an office and staff should be dedicated to J-Term planning, and administrators and members of the committee say they have long recognized that these logistical questions had to be answered before provisions could be laid, the administration did not launch an effort to identify which resources would be necessary to implement programming until very recently.Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris says that one early roadblock to incorporating courses during this period was identifying faculty members who would be willing to teach during J-Term, as the idea was met with some resistance among the faculty, especially from those who would already be losing research time as a result of a condensed summer break.But Reva P. Minkoff ’08, a student representative on the Conley committee, says that the body had anticipated that these issues would be resolved in time to implement J-Term programming as early as 2007.MORE PRESSING MATTERSThis effort was sidetracked as J-Term was overshadowed by more high-profile University and College issues. Between 2005 and 2006, University President Lawrence H. Summers’s tumultuous relationship with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and ultimate resignation shifted focus away from calendar reform, ultimately delaying the J-Term discussion.During this period, then-Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 made developing General Education, increasing student social space and improving student advising his priorities.In spring 2007, the Undergraduate Council reignited the discussion, calling for a student referendum on support for the calendar revision. Of the 3,467 students who voted, 84 percent responded in favor of the change.At the end of that academic year, Bok announced that the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—had approved a calendar modeled on the Verba committee’s initial suggested schedule.But in August 2007, just months after Bok’s announcement, Gross stepped down as dean of the College. David R. Pilbeam served as acting dean until Evelynn M. Hammonds took over in June 2008.During this time, though the administration never formally announced the prospect of structured January programming, undergraduates largely assumed that programs like those in the Conley proposals would come to fruition as soon as the calendar shifted.  ‘ON A DIFFERENT TRACK’According to Hammonds, “initial plans” for the period were underway when she took office in 2008, as her staff began investigating the possibilities for J-Term programming along the lines of what the Conley committee had originally envisioned. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith says that he and Hammonds approached the Board of Overseers and some alumni early last fall with their ideas for January and were encouraged to further investigate the details involved with implementation, especially the financial aspect of J-Term.But by November 2008—when it became evident that the economic crisis would cripple Harvard’s endowment, which the University projects will lose a third of its value by June 30—the plans for J-Term programming were overshadowed by the College’s financial concerns. “It was one of those decisions that fell down between the cracks,” Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith H. Kidd says.The administration began to approach planning for January 2009 in an entirely different light.“The train was stopped and put on a different track,” says Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin II.In April, Smith, Hammonds, and University President Drew G. Faust made the decision “not to create a separate, structured ‘January experience’ with programming offered by the College.” Instead, the campus would only be open to a select number of pre-approved students. MIXED REACTIONSThough students say they welcomed the opportunity for a five-week winter break, many say they were slightly disappointed that the College administration will not provide programming next January.    “People got excited, and then they decided to cut it,” says Rebecca H. Jablonski ’11.  But most say that their primary concern was that not all individuals seeking to return to campus would be permitted to do so. In their April e-mail, Hammonds and Smith announced that housing would be limited to students who could demonstrate a “need to be on campus.”At present, a student-faculty committee led by Assistant Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer is drafting an application for students seeking to stay on campus over break and otherwise determining logistics for the period. Ameer said that the bar for accommodating requests is “pretty high” and that the application will ask students why they need to be on campus, who they are affiliated with, and the contact information necessary to verify their affiliation. According to Kidd, the number of students who will be granted housing next January is equivalent to twice the number that can be seated in Annenberg at one time.Bill R. Rose ’11, a member of Ameer’s committee, says that though this application process is “reasonable” for next year, he hopes the committee will support the idea of allowing student group-led programming, which he says “fit in with the goal of public service” espoused by Faust and would “cost the College very little.” This possibility aligns with the initial vision of the Conley committee, according to Minkoff, who says that the group backed student-led initiatives—such as having students teach peers their native languages—as viable options for J-Term.    “These are ideas that enhance the Harvard experience and don’t require $10 million to implement,” says Minkoff, who is a former Crimson Staff Director.    However, Rose says that, at this time, it seems likely that student groups such as the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Institute of Politics will have their requests to stay for next J-Term rejected. But though students will not spend the College’s first exam-free January participating in the programming that the Conley committee envisioned, College administrators have say that formal offerings are still a possibility in the future.  “It’s not the case that we’ll never have formal J-Term programming. When the financial crisis clears up, we hope to move forward,” Ameer says. —Staff writer Bita Assad can be reached at bassad@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Lauren D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
August, 1985 marked the birth of an independent union self-organized by Harvard’s “forgotten workers.” It was nascent in every sense of the word: a couple hundred staffers led by a few unpaid organizers, with no financial backing and no official space. The organization lacked even a name.
When one practical member suggested “The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers,” most members took offense   	   at the resulting unwieldy acronym: “HUCTW.” But a 24-year-old named Bill Jaeger stepped forward to express support for the “awkward but accurate” approach—and others took notice.
When Jaeger arrived at Harvard in 1984 to work as a staff assistant in what was then known as the Russian Research Center, the Soviet relations and arms-control junkie had graduate school in mind. Unimpressed with the overt antagonism of unions during his undergraduate years at Yale, Jaeger says he felt 
“pretty skeptical” of his Harvard colleagues’ union activity. But something was different at his new workplace. A year after his arrival, Jaeger left his staff position to work full-time as a union organizer, finding time even to serve as lead lyricist of the ‘Pipettes,’ the union’s singing group.
“There was critical analysis of Harvard [by the Union] but no effort to breed or encourage hostility,” Jaeger said in an interview in the 1990s. “Nobody tried to make me feel angry at Harvard, which was good because I didn’t feel angry.”
When HUCTW was young, in the ’80s, Harvard administrators actively campaigned against the union, which consequently found itself pushed to the margins as an outsider group of negligible influence. Back then, involvement was a test of bravery: “It was bold and scary to be involved in the union at that point because there was this feeling that the powerful University was against it,” Jaeger says.
That outlier status is largely gone now, traded in the late 1990s for the greater benefits of legitimate recognition—what Jaeger calls “a defined place in the institution.” The key to the exchange, Jaeger says, was collaboration and understanding—the same kind of communicative sentiment that he now espouses as the union’s director.  
“I feel like we wore them down because the constructive partnership and mutual respect were always the goal and vision that the union had,” Jaeger says. “We had to pursue that persistently for a lot of years before the administration really took us seriously and believed that we were really doing what we said we were doing.”
For Jaeger, then, a patient respect for the administration isn’t just a flavor-of-the-month strategy: it’s a proven method, with the weight of decades behind it. It’s the reason why HUCTW has survived and grown to the size it has: approximately 4,800 strong, with staffers hailing from every niche of the University. It is, in short, one of the core missions of the union. “There are two things we care a lot about: one is to be strong advocates for the interest of the staff, and the other is to be responsible partners with the administration,” Jaeger says. 
When the two objectives fall easily in line, the job is a smooth one. But when one side has to make tough choices at the expense of the other, things unfold a little less clearly. In the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis, when job cuts at the University seem inevitable and the union’s role is more important then ever, the balancing act—between effective partnership with the University and aggressive advocacy to save jobs—is a difficult one. For Jaeger, the man charged with maintaining the uneasy equilibrium, the job has not gotten any easier. 
“It’s absolutely possible,” he says, “for us to be too flabby or too strident.”
AN UNPLEASANT REALITY
The thinking of the union leadership has shifted considerably over the past five months—from optimism that members could weather the fiscal storm without suffering too many ill effects, to sober recognition that sacrifices will have to be made to bring the University back into the black. “We were more hopeful originally that any changes in the staffing pattern or reductions would be incremental or spotty,” Jaeger says. “But it’s become clear in the past few months, it’s worse than that.”
The one policy decision that has most influenced the union’s evolving approach towards the possibility of layoffs—“the big enchilada,” Jaeger calls it—was a March announcement that funding from the endowment, Harvard’s multi-billion dollar treasury, would decline by more than 15 percent over the next two years.
The news was sobering University-wide. For the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s largest school, which comprises about a third of the union’s membership, the news was particularly bleak—FAS relies on endowment funding for over half of its annual budget, third-most among the University’s 11 schools. “A bad day,” Jaeger calls the date when the payout decision was announced. In fact, it was probably more than that: the first clear signal of how difficult it would be for HUCTW to ensure that its members would escape the financial crisis unscathed. 
“It would be tragically foolish for the University to continue spending money on the same trajectory. It’s inevitable that Harvard has to change,” Jaeger says. “Is it possible to resolve financial challenges this deep without anybody being laid off?”
Jaeger, in all his practicality, seems to lean toward a ‘no.’ Union leaders have begun to schedule meetings with schools and departments that have told them they are considering changes that could result in involuntary layoffs, according to Jaeger. Otherwise, concrete information has been meager.
Because administrators have been wary about discussing any impending layoffs, union leadership has been forced to go into information-seeking mode for the last several months with mixed results, bringing into sharp relief the necessity that collaboration be a two-way street. “Where there’s strong [University] leadership, it’s working,” says HUCTW executive board member Linda Kluz of labor-management discussions. “But where there’s no leadership, there is no information forthcoming.”
Even Jaeger admits that the gross ramifications of the financial decline have alerted the union to the absence of University leadership when it comes to thinking beyond calculations and figures. “The main thing [central administrators] really do is set that number,” Jaeger says. “We wish they were doing more than that to really lead or to advise the schools and departments as to how to cope.”
LAY OFF THOSE LAYOFFS
But even in tough times, Jaeger hasn’t discarded his conviction that relationships with administrators are a far more powerful tool than “shouting through the windows.” He was struck by some of the parallels between the cutbacks unveiled on the FAS Web site last month and a few of the union’s suggestions in their public letters. For example, in a December letter, the union leadership called for the closing of leased commercial spaces and slashing of catering budgets—both of which will be implemented next year.
“That’s gratifying,” Jaeger says. “We didn’t invent those ideas, for sure, but I feel like our union has had some influence in our written communications and in our meetings with senior administrators.”
As one of the top leaders of the union, Jaeger meets regularly with FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Brett C. Sweet and Associate Dean for Administrative Resources Geoffrey Peters. HUCTW leaders have also cultivated access to mid-level deans like FAS Administrative Dean for Science Russ Porter and FAS Associate Dean for Arts and Humanities Sara Oseasohn, Jaeger says.
The onus is usually on the union to reach out and make relationships, rather than the other way around, says Kluz. “I wouldn’t say it’s both sides reaching out to each other. I’d say management is responding to our requests as best they can,” she says. “Of course, Bill and other officers of the union are the ones that are approaching the administration and trying to get information from the top all the way down.”
At the least, union leaders expect the University to protect “its people” by focusing on non-personnel cuts and leaving layoffs as a last resort. Local administrators are contractually required to engage the union in conversation and negotiation whenever they are considering specific layoffs. Called “consultation when considering,” the agreement gives affected staffers the opportunity to understand the reasons behind the proposed job cut.
If administrators decide to cut a staffer after consultation, the laid off individual is placed under the union’s work security program—an offering HUCTW hopes to strengthen—which gives former staffers hiring preference over outside candidates with similar qualifications competing for open positions within the University. In most of the conversations with administrators these past few months, union officials have been emphasizing the importance of the program. “That needs some talking,” Jaeger says. But not all of his colleagues believe that talking is the answer.
NOT ONE UNION, DIVISIBLE
Geoffrey Carens is a microtext reproduction specialist. Most weekdays, he sits at a reference desk in Lamont Library and assists students in operating the digital scanners. Save for a lunchtime jaunt, Carens has barely seen the light of day by the time he emerges from the library at 9 p.m.
But the library is only a day job. Within the staff community at Harvard, Geoff Carens is a well-known rabble-rouser who has garnered a reputation as a radical leftist. Over the years, Carens and a core group of about 10 HUCTW members—collectively known as “Reform HUCTW”—have waged public counter-attacks against the University. The battle cry has grown even stronger in a time of marked financial strain.
Mention the group to most unionized staffers in the know, and the reactions will undoubtedly fall into one of three categories: enthusiastic agreement from fellow activists, uncomfortable wariness (“Yeah, I think they’re a little hard-edge,” says executive board member Scott Lozier), and gentle dismissal.
“It seems like they just fight for fighting’s sake,” says a union representative who requested to not be named in order to preserve her relations with union members. “It’s not that I dislike them—they’re like a curiosity, really.”
Whenever the topic of the radical faction is broached to union leaders, they typically emphasize the group’s small representation within a sprawling community. “It’s pretty clear that the vast majority of members of the union believe in a thoughtful, constructive approach,” Jaeger says carefully when asked about Reform HUCTW.
But Carens would disagree. He likes to think of himself as a proletarian warrior championing the cause of the mistreated masses. Many union members, Carens says, wish their leadership would take a more aggressive stance against University administrators by leading and organizing public protests.
Jaeger’s mantra of collaboration and negotiation with University management has rendered the leader “much, much too passive” when it comes to defending worker livelihood, says Reform HUCTW member and library assistant Ed Dupree. The line dividing the interests of workers and management is impenetrable, and any concession that blurred the demarcation would signal concession—or weakness.
With a philosophy this black and white, military metaphors couldn’t be more apt. And Carens uses them enthusiastically: the administration is “basically attacking workers,” University leadership is “coming after us” in an organized “offensive,” and workers need to combine forces with their “natural allies.” In Carens’ eyes, the Harvard Corporation—a well-oiled enemy with superior weapons and hometurf advantage—is determined to hold onto its fat paycheck, duly provoking staff into action.
“We believe in adversarial relations between labor and management,” Dupree says. “We think the two sides are opposed, and we want to defend workers’ interests without reference to management’s interests.”
This belief marks a point of contrast—and a consequent breeding ground for radical discontent—between union leadership and Reform HUCTW. The executive board believes fruitful communication between management and workers is possible, that the discussion is “side-by-side at the table rather than across from the table,” Kluz says. “We share interests in what we want to accomplish—it’s just a matter of how we’re going to get there.” But in Dupree’s view, the two sides talk past each other because they speak “different ideological languages.”
“You don’t just passively sit back and hope from the force of your logical argument to convince management,” Carens says. “Negotiations aren’t achieving what they need to achieve, and now it’s time to hit the streets.”
THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE
Jaeger has a leader’s title but a collective conscience. When he walks into a room, he deflects attention and launches his body forward as though he cannot get himself to the other side of the room quickly enough. Though decidedly one of the most visible leaders of HUCTW, Jaeger vehemently refuses to describe his role without emphasizing the service of his colleagues—he is a man working on behalf of the masses.
As the director of thousands of staff workers scattered throughout the University, Jaeger is privy to a gamut of unit-centric details that a typical College administrator in University Hall may not have access to. Acting as the collective mouthpiece is Jaeger’s job. “He finds a way to capture the concerns that people have,” says Lozier, who serves on the HUCTW executive board. “He’s a big gatherer and communicator.”
Despite the union’s determination to address individual concerns, the leadership has “frustrated” some of the staffers in the past few months. When union leaders “[shouted] from the rooftops” that departments ought to cut their catering budgets, union members involved in the University’s hospitality function “took it poorly,” Jaeger says. Staffers working in the Allston development group were similarly displeased when the union publicly called for the shutting down of Allston construction.
When Jaeger comes to work, the people are often too many to please. “Somedays, it feels like walking through a minefield,” he remarks, adding that a utilitarian outlook is often needed to deal with a community as disparate as the University’s staffers.
But Jaeger isn’t quick to push out those who don’t align themselves with the philosophy of union leaders. All staff workers—and hopefully all University administrators—want to keep jobs secure wherever possible, he hopes.
“Leaders in our union want very badly to be sure that we’re a strong, clear voice representing the things our members care about and dealing as partners with the administrative leaders of the University we care about,” he says. “There may be some difference in tactic, but I think we’re very much all rowing in the same direction and hoping for the same outcomes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A secretive search process to replace former Dean of the Law School Elena Kagan has reached the beginning of the end with no clear candidate to replace the much-loved administrator. With the clock ticking down towards the University’s self-imposed deadline of having a successor in place by the end of the school year, the consultation process with Law School faculty, donors, and students has ended, and the installment of a new Dean is incumbent on when University President Drew G. Faust makes her decision, according to a senior Law School professor familiar with the search process, who, like other faculty members, asked that his name not be used because of the sensitivity of an ongoing search. In the run-up to Kagan assuming the Deanship, she emerged as the leading candidate, along with Williston Professor of Law Robert H. Mnookin, well ahead of then-President Lawrence H. Summers’ decision. This time around, the field is more open, with a slate of seven internal candidates and, among those, three or four top candidates whom Faust is considering for the job.
The short-list includes acting Dean Howell E. Jackson and Harvard Law School Professors David J. Barron ’89, John Coates, John F. Manning ’82, Martha Minow, David B. Wilkins ’77, and Elizabeth Warren, according to the senior Law School professor familiar with the search process.
Among that list, Jackson, Manning, and Minow have risen to the top. Wilkins may also be a top candidate, but opinions among the faculty vary about whether he should be included on the list of most likely candidates. Faculty members were, however, in near unanimity in naming Jackson, Manning, and Minow as frontrunners.
Although these professors have all been considered for the position, whether they would accept an offer to serve as Dean remains unclear—assuming the position entails largely sacrificing one’s research and taking on increased hours to cope with the responsibilities of leading the Law School.
Whomever Faust ends up choosing to permanently succeed Kagan, that person faces the monumental task of not only stepping into the shoes of the most popular Law School Dean in recent memory but also managing a budget squeezed by a precipitous fall in the University endowment and making difficult decisions as to how to restructure a large, hallowed institution that just a few years ago was known for infighting among faculty and a lack of concern for student life.
Each of the top candidates brings a different set of skills and drawbacks to the deanship, and who Faust picks will ultimately depend on which priorities she deems most important for the future of the Law School and her relationship with it.
THE LOOMING BUDGET
On the list of pressing issues facing the next Dean, the budget looms large.
The University has asked the Law School to orchestrate a 10 percent cut in its budget—the magnitude of which entails some painful reshuffling of priorities, potential reorganization, and at least some job cuts.
Jackson, the acting dean, has garnered praise from his colleagues on the faculty for his leadership over the future of the school’s budgetary priorities at a tenuous time, and as a result, his stock has risen as a candidate for Dean.
“People are very confident in his ability to manage the financial situation at the law school and probably less confident in the ability of the others—not that they wouldn’t be able to,” says Law School Professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67. “Howell has demonstrated a very close knowledge of the budget and how to deal with it.”
The next Dean will begin his or her tenure with a budget designed by Jackson for fiscal year 2010. Next year’s fiscal plan includes some cuts in staff positions and student amenities but maintains its financial aid commitments and the school’s ambitious building project in the Northwest Corner of its campus, Jackson said in an interview with The Crimson in May.
Jackson, an expert in financial regulation and budget policy, brings a wealth of experience to the budgetary process through his research interests and familiarity with the school’s finances from having served as Kagan’s vice dean for the budget since 2003.
Jackson’s intimate knowledge of the responsibilities of the Dean may, however, actually lead him to shy away from accepting the job, said one senior professor.
If Faust hopes to install a Dean that can hit the ground running on the budget and continue the budgetary reforms initiated by Jackson, she may favor him as permanent Dean. Professors Manning, Minow, and Wilkins lack Jackson’s familiarity with the budget and might be unable to make progress on the budget as quickly, according to several senior professors on the faculty.
If Faust passes on Jackson, the next Dean would face a steeper learning curve in terms of mastering the budget and  would require more staff support to understand the school’s finances than the budget-savvy acting Dean.
“They would have to assemble a team that would help them make the judgments that Howell [Jackson] is already in a position to make,” Tushnet says.
Manning has been commended for his work on the appointments committee—the advisory body responsible for faculty hires—that yielded several high profile faculty hires during Kagan’s tenure as Dean. But whether Manning can convert that administrative experience into managing a multi-million dollar budget remains to be seen.
Both Minow and Wilkins have administrative expertise in their own right but of a different nature than Jackson’s.
Minow worked on a key component of the Kagan legacy—helping mastermind the curricular reforms ushered in under Kagan’s tenure. That experience, faculty members say, has served as a catalyst for her candidacy, as some on the faculty say more work is necessary to make the reforms a lasting part of the student experience at the school.
Through the course of his research on the legal profession, Wilkins has managed an extensive research project that Tushnet says demands a certain level of administrative competency that should not be discounted.
But views over Wilkins are conflicting, with one faculty member expressing concern over his abilities as an administrator.
Budgetary projections will likely influence Faust’s thinking on the importance of appointing a candidate who can immediately manage the budget—if endowment managers project that spending will be constrained in the long term by disappointing endowment performance, then administrative capabilities are likely to weigh more heavily in her decision, Tushnet says.
THE VISION FACTOR
In selecting the next Dean, Faust may be searching for more intangible qualities than a demonstrated ability to manage a budget.
Installing a new dean represents Faust’s first major interaction with the Law School, and, as such, will largely determine the nature of her relationship with the school in years to come, says one professor with knowledge of the search process.
Faust has, in the past, repeatedly emphasized her commitment to interdisciplinary studies across the University’s many schools.
That may favor Minow, an interdisciplinary scholar who began her Harvard career at the Graduate School of Education and who faculty say would bring the broadest perspective to the University among the candidates for Dean.
“She has many of the qualities that made Elena Kagan such a successful dean,” says one senior faculty member. “They include an ability to reach out across the spectrum, an intense engagement with everyone’s work, deep concern for the school and its mission, a very transparent accessibility to both colleagues, students, and staff, and the capacity to excite people about the pursuit and study of law in ways that would make her an inspiring and energizing figure.”
But emulating Kagan in certain ways has not made Minow a lock for the top spot.
There is some concern among some members of the faculty—an unfounded claim in the view of others—that perhaps Minow is too affable and unwilling to say ‘no,’ a potential obstacle when having to make cuts to the budget, a process that will entail denying some programs and not others, says one faculty member.
But given her work on curricular reform, Minow would bring a clear vision to the position of Dean, again casting her in the mold of Elena Kagan, who aimed to build the faculty and end its polarization as well as to reform student life, says another faculty member.
Although Jackson has shown himself to be a capable administrator, questions remain over what direction he would take the school and what vision he would bring to the corner office in Griswold Hall.
One faculty member said he did not doubt Jackson’s ability to formulate a vision for the school but said that, at this stage, it remains unclear exactly what that vision would be.
Similarly, Manning, though described as a bright and engaging individual, has not articulated a clear vision, according to faculty members.
“To the extent that the President is interested in someone with a long-term vision, it’s not clear to me that he does have that,” Tushnet says. “It’s not clear that that is an important consideration, but if it is an important thing, then it’s an obstacle.”
And if Faust is searching for someone to be a standard bearer for the Law School, she may look to Wilkins, who is universally described as someone who loves the school and unusually willing to make sacrifices on its behalf.
“He has eagerly put aside personal priorities in order to facilitate the work of the school and its committees,” says one senior professor at the Law School. “In doing so, he has demonstrated traits of character are indispensable in a good Dean.”
Additionally, if appointed Dean, Wilkins would be the first black administrator to hold the position. Currently, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds is the only African-American leading a school at the University.
RECRUITING A CANDIDATE
But which individual ascends the Law School’s deanship may depend less on Faust’s preferences and more on who is willing to accept the post.
The faculty interviewed say that the other candidates on the short list have taken their names out of contention because they are not interested in becoming Dean, at least at this point in their careers.
Warren, who has risen to national prominence in recent months as overseer of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, seems unlikely to give up her government position to return to Cambridge in an administrative role.
“Warren might consider it if she was not so deeply involved in the TARP business, which is ultimately more important,” says one faculty member.
Barron, who is on leave from Harvard for a job in the Obama administration, also seems unlikely to leave D.C. for the Griswold office. One faculty member added that, given his youth, Barron will likely have another chance to attain the top job at the Law School.
And after a history turning down administrative posts, citing a desire to maintain her family life—a concern shared by Coates in taking his name out of consideration—Minow’s potential willingness to accept the position was cast into doubt by one professor. 
Jackson expressed a desire to return to his research in an interview with The Crimson in May, and in a town hall with students early this semester quipped that he had promised his wife only six months of “this madness.”
Colleagues on the faculty were unsure of whether Manning and Wilkins would accept the post if it was offered to them.
But given colleagues’ description of Wilkins’ willingness to make sacrifices on behalf of the school, it seems unlikely that the responsibilities of the Dean’s office might dissuade him from accepting the post.
At this point, the ball is in Faust’s court, and the time frame for announcing a successor depends on when she makes a decision and recruits a candidate.
Although it is unlikely that a successor to Kagan will be in place by the end of the school year, in the words of acting Dean Jackson during a conversation about the next Dean, “July 1 is a very important date.”
The tenor of Faust’s relationship with the Law School and the future of that institution will in part be decided in the next weeks. Who she chooses and what qualities that choice embodies will say much about her priorities and vision for an institution that has been both at the forefront of American legal scholarship and at the center national politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past year, the Medical School has steadily become embroiled in the conflict of interest debate, as student groups lobby administrators to strengthen existing policies to regulate industry ties at both the school and at its affiliated hospitals.
The debate burst onto the national scene after U.S. Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, reported last June that psychiatrist Joseph Biederman of Harvard-affiliated Mass. General Hospital received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs he had used to treat children for bipolar disorder.
Tensions mounted during the fall as a small group of vocal first-year students publicly challenged the Medical School administration with mixed success and divisive effect—even giving rise to a reactionary student movement put off by the first-years’ anti-industry rhetoric.
A year later, this fiery dialogue has cooled as the students wait for the release of recommendations from the Medical School’s 19-member conflict of interest review committee. In six weeks, the waiting ends, and the students will have to recalibrate their stances to a new reality.
RAISING CONSCIOUSNESS
After coming across what they viewed as a potential conflict of interest in a Medical School class last September, a group of first-year students banded together to press the administration to codify long-standing informal policies—effectively triggering the first set of conversations that would dominate interactions between the opposing student groups.
The first-years—members of the American Medical Students Association, a national group that has made waves by rating medical school conflict of interest policies—alleged that a board position held by Professor Paul G. G. Richardson raised concerns because a drug marketed by that company was discussed in class.
Richardson did not, in fact, violate any of the Medical School’s existing conflict of interest policies. But the AMSA students had touched upon an important matter—there was no written disclosure policy for the classroom at the time.
Spurred by the possible conflict and the lack of any written policy preventing it, the students began advocating not only for more stringent policies within the Medical School but also across the affiliated hospitals, where students complete their third and fourth years of training.
“This isn’t about a few bad apples,” says David C. Tian, a first-year medical student who joined the AMSA protesters early this year in their quest to revamp the school’s conflict of interest policies. “This is a systemic issue that requires policy-making on the institutional level. Harvard Medical School should represent the practice of medicine as a whole.”
A month after the movement began, the school’s curriculum committee revised the student handbook to include a section of new policies mandating that faculty and students disclose all financial ties to industry when discussing drugs developed by those companies.
But in pushing for a uniform set of policies that would apply to Harvard’s 17 affiliated hospitals and institutes, the students’ plans hit a snag that has plagued similar efforts for years.
Repeated attempts to adopt a uniform policy across the hospitals have fallen prey to the hospitals’ independence.
“Starting with our third year, our teachers are doctors who are interacting with industry on a daily basis in ways that the Medical School currently doesn’t standardize or set standards for,” Tian told The Crimson last fall.
But as administrators note, HMS—unlike many other medical schools—does not own or operate its affiliated hospitals. The hospitals are independent, non-profit entities, each under its own public charter and governed by its own board of trustees.
“We don’t want to step on the hospitals’ toes,” Gretchen A. Brodnicki, the school’s dean for faculty and research integrity, told The Crimson at the time. “But we can work with them and see what makes the best sense for them and the medical students.”
UNDER REVIEW
In November, Dean of the Medical School Jeffrey S. Flier held a town hall meeting for students that included discussions of current conflict of interest policy. He told the students that the Medical School’s hands were tied and that new conflict of interest policy would be left up to a larger University review. 
“We heard that the Medical School could not act independently,” Tian says.
But the students heard a different story a few days before winter break, when they met with David Korn ’54, the University’s recently-appointed vice provost for research, who would lead the University review.
Korn told the students that the University policy would not craft specific policies and that any new code of conduct would have to be created by the Medical School.
In mid-January, Flier hosted a panel on corporate interactions with academics, featuring several members of the faculty with industry ties, according to Tian.
Later that day, Flier announced the launch of an internal medical school review of conflict of interest policy, and the committee drafting the new regulations was to include students. 	
The three students on the committee were all upperclassmen with no discernible ties to the fall’s rallies or petitions. 
Mark L. Zeidel, chair of the department of medicine at Beth Israel, says the conflict of interest committee has met several times, breaking into subcommittees to tackle policy pertaining to basic research, clinical work, and enforcement.
He says that in initial meetings, committee members have dissected current policies and recommendations from the American Association of Medical Colleges, Stanford, and Cleveland Clinic.
Systems Biology Professor Peter K. Sorger ’83 adds that he “suspects” the new medical school policy will “closely align” with a new policy from Partners HealthCare, which owns two of Harvard’s largest affiliated hospitals. Partners chartered stringent regulations in April, imposing a blanket ban on gifts and forbidding administrators from having stock options in companies for which they hold board membership. 
A month earlier, a new Massachusetts state law imposed a ban on gifts and a public disclosure mandate for pharmaceutical company funding in excess of $50, which will go into effect July 1.
Zeidel says that contrary to media portrayals, Harvard has historically had one of the most stringent conflict of interest policies in the country, especially regarding access to stock options.
“We have lost faculty members in the past because we were more restrictive,” he says.
STUDENT TENSIONS
In the aftermath of the AMSA protests, a new student group emerged to ensure that the AMSA students did not dominate the increasingly charged conflict of interest dialogue.
Representatives of the Benjamin Rush Society have met twice with Flier in recent months, according to group co-leader Vijay Yanamadala ’07, after the fledgling group issued a petition calling for preservation of industry relations at the medical school.
Society co-leader Brian S. Fuchs ’04 says that in their meetings, Flier seemed to privately agree with the group’s sentiments.
According to Tian, AMSA students have enjoyed no such administrative access. “We haven’t met with any administrators about the conflict of interest policy,” Tian says.
The groups opposing philosophies have created a apparent divide among students on the issue.
“We don’t take the scientific progress that has been made over the past 60 years for granted,” says Fuchs.
Yanamadala says that professors should be trusted to form ethical relationships, and that disclosure and transparency will allow for complete “self-regulation.”
Though the Benjamin Rush Society and AMSA agree that more transparency is necessary, one major source of contention remains.
The current medical school policy forbids all industry interactions with first and second year students.
AMSA has lobbied to extend that blanket ban to third and fourth year students, who leave the Quadrangle classrooms for hospital-based clinical work.
Yanamadala says the Benjamin Rush Society strongly opposes the proposal. 
“It would be pretty detrimental to overall learning process,” he says.
Zeidel says that the committee is attuned to this issue, but there remains the problem of enforcing any regulations at the hospitals, where students will be off campus and cannot be policed directly. 
Zeidel says that by including students on the committee, the Medical School hopes that other students will be encouraged to follow these “voluntary offsite” regulations.
INTERNAL DEBATE
Whatever the outcome of its deliberations, the committee appears unlikely to follow AMSA’s prescriptions verbatim.
The national group has consistently delivered scathing conflict of interest grades for Harvard and many other top-tier medical schools, drawing criticism from many in academia.
Zeidel says that he doubts the relevance of Harvard’s recent F grade.
“If you can give a school an F on something, you get news,” he says. “I don’t think the ratings have anything to with reality.”
Flier has publicly questioned the AMSA rating as well—Harvard automatically failed because it did not submit its conflict of interest policy for review.
“As a result, the relevance of the AMSA grade is a matter for legitimate discussion,” Flier wrote in an e-mail to medical students March 6 after the conflict of interest policy garnered national media attention.
Fuchs says that skepticism of the AMSA group is growing on campus. 
“AMSA students are louder and more obnoxious than any other student group,” says Fuchs. “You wouldn’t want to be using a pen provided by a drug company in their presence because you would be sure to get a response.”
Tian says he helped run a meeting after class this spring that sought to diffuse misconceptions about conflict of interest.
Zeidel adds that he does not think the Medical School was treated fairly during the student protests last fall. He says that the students did not give HMS the opportunity to address the issue internally before going public. 
“I would have asked to sit down with the Dean of the Medical School and have a conversation,” he says. “I think its fair to say there are ways to get things done in a constructive manner that will get less publicity, but will actually get the job done.”
Though Zeidel says he has no ties to industry because he is setting an example for his department, he is still unsure that he espouses the views of some of the “more radical” members of the HMS faculty. 
“If you disagree with them, that doesn’t mean that you are evil or somehow conflicted,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether the first-year President was truly indignant about the headline emblazoned on the front page of her morning newspaper or whether her reaction was merely an attempt at damage control is difficult to discern. Regardless, Drew G. Faust, in a break with her usual public restraint, wasted no time in quashing the report.“Harvard is not ‘rethinking’ Allston,” she wrote that December morning in 2007 when the article was published. “I am unequivocally committed to moving aggressively and ambitiously forward, and to making our unfolding plans a reality.”A year and a half later, with the world fully steeped in financial turmoil, that report in the Boston Globe—which suggested that Faust was distancing herself from the confrontational, fast-moving style of her predecessor, Lawrence H. Summers, and rethinking the University’s outsized Allston plans—seems remarkably prescient. The University has not only struggled to make ends meet in an unprecedented fiscal crisis, but it has also reined in its visionary—and what some have criticized as financially irresponsible—plans to construct a new campus across the Charles. In November, Faust wrote that Harvard would weather the market turmoil by “staying true to our academic values and our long-term ambitions.” But just three months later, she cited the University’s “collective obligation to face the situation with the right balance of short-term focus and long-term ambition” in soberly announcing her decision to slow construction of the Allston Science Complex—long considered the lynchpin of Harvard’s 50-year planned expansion. Now, with the University’s budgets critically strained, some have suggested that Harvard’s present fiscal challenges have arisen in part because financial planning for Allston was given short shrift by Summers, who instead set his sights on loftier institutional and research goals.“I think the Allston project was a combination of genuine ambition for Harvard to remain at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs and for President Summers to have created something for which he would be remembered,” says former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68. “To go out and borrow money on buildings, on top of [a troubled budget] without having a plan for raising the funds—credible, realistic plans for building—was a mistake in my view.” Others defend the former President’s plans, arguing that the University’s heavily debt-financed and accelerated Allston expansion was essential for Harvard’s continued scientific competitiveness, and that the planning was not unusually or excessively risky. Rather, they say, a confluence of unfortunate events decimated University budgets and forced Faust’s hand.“It would have been so imprudent and financially impossible to go ahead with this pace and scale,” said University Provost Steven E. Hyman in a recent interview with The Crimson.Whatever the origins of Harvard’s current predicament in Allston, it is clear that, at least for the foreseeable future, the visionary “blue sky” planning once preached during the Summers era has been replaced by a more measured, fiscally somber planning process. ‘BLUE SKY’Since his earliest days in office, Summers was openly ambitious about his plans to transform Allston, a vision he hoped to make the hallmark of his tenure. As evidenced in his annual letters to the community, his primary motivation to invest in Allston was to ensure the continued strength of the sciences at Harvard, which he said would soon suffer from a crippling insufficiency of space. Alyssa A. Goodman, an astronomy professor who served on the Provost’s Advisory Group on Science at the time, recalls the visionary scope of Summers’ ambitions.“A faculty group is not usually convened to just dream big,” Goodman says. “But everyone was told, ‘We want to know what you would do if you didn’t have to worry about the costs.’ It was kind of refreshing.” Summers’ eventual plan for the new campus—first presented to Harvard’s deans at a summer retreat in 2003 and officially announced that fall—boldly called for both the construction of undergraduate housing and the relocation of two graduate schools to Allston, all anchored around a hub for interdisciplinary science research. To “consider more fully the opportunities and challenges” inherent in these programmatic goals, Summers convened four Allston task forces in 2003 to examine elements of the plan more closely. Goodman says that these committees eventually did touch on budgetary considerations in its evaluation of different ideas. But while most of the deans and faculty agreed that Harvard’s long-term needs required an energetic push into neighboring Allston, considerable friction soon arose around the plan’s particulars—and also around Summers’ aggressive, independent, and at times dictatorial style. “For reasons deeply rooted in University governance and tradition...matters that are curricular are matters of the Faculty,” Summers said at the time. But he noted that it was not the Faculty’s prerogative to vote on Allston proposals. “Matters regarding the allocation of resources by Massachusetts Law are reserved for the Harvard Corporation,” he said.And the secrecy of the planning troubled professors as well. When former Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jeremy R. Knowles penned a major report on Allston in 2003 that argued against moving FAS sciences across the river, professors were only allowed to read the report behind closed University Hall and department chair doors. Concerns soon swirled in FAS that planning for Allston was a “fait accompli” and that objections and discussions about Summers’ plans were not being taken into account. Ironically, then as now, FAS suffered from fiscal difficulties, for which Summers advised, “we would all do well to be very prudent in the use of our resources.” Yet he continued to keep the Faculty in the dark about how Allston would be financed. His lengthy 2003 President’s Letter to the Harvard Community on Allston Planning dedicated only a brief, vague paragraph to the costs that would be incurred (a to-be-defined “formidable financing challenge”). Subsequent letters were similarly quiet on the subject.BORROWING TO BUILDIn most cases, Harvard uses a mix of debt, philanthropy, and University resources for capital construction—a financing scheme the University intends to follow in Allston, according to Chief Financial Officer Dan Shore. But concerned that Harvard was lagging behind its peers in scientific prowess, Summers-era administrators made expedience their goal—planning to fast-track construction through debt financing, without the donor support University planners usually prefer.“If we can’t move ahead in a timely fashion, I think we will lose many of our leading scientists to other areas,” Hyman said in 2007 to the board of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, seeking the city’s approval for proceeding with construction of the Science Complex. “Keeping this dream team together is absolutely critical.”In keeping with Harvard’s traditional mixture of grandeur and secrecy, the costs of the Science Complex have never been revealed, although speculation and media reports have estimated the costs to be around $1 billion. To this day, that sum has been funded entirely through debt, according to Shore, and the University has no current intentions to refinance its debt for the project.While some amount of debt financing is typical for construction projects, the University’s obligations for this particular project are considered to be extremely high—though Harvard’s large endowment and high returns have traditionally allowed it to borrow heavily.“One hundred percent debt financing is very aggressive both on the part of the developer and the lender,” says Victor Calanog, director of research at Reis, Inc., a commercial real estate research firm. “It basically assumes that your capacity to pay won’t be encumbered in any way—either because you’re very assured of your income streams, or you’re confident about a project being completed very quickly or on-time and then turned into an income-generating asset.”But the income stream that was supposed to relieve some of the debt—namely, a large, multi-billion dollar capital campaign—never materialized, derailed by tumult over Summers’ presidency and the administrative turnover that followed his forced departure in 2006.But even with Faust solidly entrenched in Mass. Hall nearly two years after her installation, heavy debt financing appears likely to persist for some time.According to Shore, University development officers typically report difficulty raising money for bricks and mortar, versus programmatic elements. And Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers suggested in a recent interview that she intends to hold off on discussions with potential Allston donors until “the process of recalibrating the near-term status of the project is completed”—a decision slated for this fall.Another source of revenue—the annual half-percent levy on the University endowment first taken in 2002 to pay for planning initiatives, infrastructure improvements, and redevelopment of acquired property—has similarly dried up. Hyman said earlier this spring that the Strategic Infrastructure Fund, as the tax is now known, has little, if any, discretionary money remaining after subtracting funds pledged for interest payments and expenditures.A DOSE OF REALITYThis year, the projected 30 percent hit to Harvard’s endowment has suddenly laid bare the risks inherent in the University’s aggressive capital financing.Harvard is now aiming to halve its spending in capital projects—currently estimated at $1 billion a year over the next three to four years, with an additional $3 billion in debt, according to Moody’s Investors Services. But even before markets began to plunge and Harvard announced a 22 percent decline in the endowment for the four months ending Oct. 31, Faust was reportedly uneasy about the rigor of Harvard’s financial planning for its Allston expansion, according to one faculty member closely connected to University officials. While she was generally knowledgeable about the framework and programmatic elements of the Allston expansion from her time as dean of the Radcliffe Institute, Faust may not have been aware of the Allston plan’s reliance on debt nor the difficulty of raising funds for the project until she took office, according to the faculty member, who requested anonymity to preserve their relationship with University officials.“She evidently felt that this was not a decision that was made as fully or carefully financially as it should have been,” says the professor.Faust recently said in an interview that she thinks the Science Complex was “on a fast track” and that “we went ahead with the design of the building before we went and raised money from people,” though she added that this is standard practice at Harvard. With markets deteriorating, Shore, Harvard’s CFO, says that by the fall, it was clear “the old capital plan didn’t fit the new reality, so we basically started fresh from the ground up—what are the projects we need to do, what are our priorities.”According to Christopher M. Gordon, chief operating officer for Harvard’s Allston Development Group, planners methodically examined all of the University’s capital commitments throughout the fall, with Faust making the ultimate decision on the construction pace of the Science Complex.“We didn’t want to run out the first time the stock market dips 10 points and stop a big project,” Gordon says. “But on the other hand, you want to make sure you make decisions thoughtfully and in a timely manner.” He adds that taking care of the scientists and the research that was supposed to be housed in the Science Complex was the “highest priority” for planners.Even in the fall, Faust said, “it would have seemed unimaginable to slow construction.” But by the winter it was clear that not only was construction financially less feasible, but also that internal demand for construction was shifting as well. After consulting widely on what she and those who know her say was an extremely difficult and symbolic decision, Faust recommended to the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing board—that Allston construction be slowed.Now, even the Science Complex—long heralded as the centerpiece of the Allston campus—receives its dose of administrative caution. Last month, Gordon said it was “extremely unlikely” that the project would be stopped forever. But he would not say for certain.‘STAY THE COURSE’The lack of consultation during the Summers planning process has also frustrated some faculty members, who feel the current fiscal predicament could have been at least partially avoided through a more open process.“I think many of us on the faculty felt that the mission on this side of the river would be impaired if Harvard had moved too aggressively with Allston, and that clearly happened,” says Richard F. Thomas, a classics professor. Instead, “it was pretty much show and tell. I think there would have been a lot more balancing of the current, real parts of the University, and a lot less aggressive movement in Allston if the perception that some of us had was taken into account.”But others say it is unfair to make such accusations only after a nose-diving economy has made the ramifications of aggressive debt-financing for construction apparent.“I don’t think we’d even be talking about this if we didn’t have some pretty extraordinary events in the economy,” says Joshua D. Coval, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. “It’s pretty easy to second-guess these decisions...but basically, I think all of those were reasonable things to do in normal or even mildly unusual circumstances.”John P. Huchra, former vice provost for research policy, cites bad luck as the source of Harvard’s current fiscal quagmire. “It was an aggressive but a reasonably sound plan,” Huchra says. “It would be hard to say that, at the time, what was being planned was the bad thing to do. To be honest, it’s hard to say now that what was being planned was a bad thing to do.”While a combination of over-ambition, poor communication, and bad fortune has exacerbated Harvard’s fiscal plight, the University’s top planners, at least, appear to have kept their faith in Summers’ Allston vision. “I think the long-range vision was not originally derived by saying how much money do we have at what point in time,” says Kathy Spiegelman, the University’s chief planner, in a recent interview.And Gordon says he does not believe the current economic crisis has made Faust less enthusiastic about the long-term vision for Allston.“She’s a historian, so she gets the long term view. And Allston is a long-term view,” Gordon says. “I mean, markets go up and down, donors go up and down, but I think she really gets the point that you have to stay the course.” —Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard E. Neustadt, the founding director of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, was fond of saying that the power of the Presidency is the power of persuasion.Of course, the late White House adviser meant the U.S. Presidency, but without the trappings of the American executive branch, a standing army, or a multi-billion dollar budget, leadership on the Undergraduate Council perhaps offers at least an equally compelling proof of Neustadt’s thesis.Persuasiveness was a trait clearly prized by last year’s UC leader Matthew L. Sundquist ’09, a habitual social networker among undergraduates, faculty, and administrators.But for Andrea R. Flores ’10, who succeeded Sundquist as the UC’s executive last semester, that power appears to have come far less easily—both in University Hall and on the Council.It’s partly personality.Sundquist was a social butterfly (Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin once quipped that walking the Yard with him was like accompanying a governor—”he really knows everyone”). Flores is more reserved.And it’s partly circumstance.Rather than network with administrators, Flores made it her stated priority to focus on relationships with students. But in a semester defined by planned reductions in College spending on student life, Flores was forced to refocus her attention toward College politics, though perhaps too late.Flores and her Council found themselves without a seat at the table when decisions were made, generally unable to influence policy until news has already been delivered to the student body’s inboxes.“On a couple matters, albeit somewhat important ones, the Council has been reactionary,” says Randall S. Sarafa ’09, former UC vice president. “It’s beyond me whether that has been the consequence of the administration or failed communication on the part of the UC—those issues include J-Term and budget cuts.”Flores readily acknowledges that she was forced to work to affect policy after decisions had already been made on both issues, but cites as the reason what she says is a lack of prioritization of student opinion in decision making.“It isn’t a choice. I’m only capable of being reactive and not proactive,” she says. “Was I reactive by choice? No. Did it turn out that way? Yes.”And within the Council, Flores came down on the losing side of the debate on how to create more student social space—perhaps the body’s most high-profile legislative effort of the semester.Now, with only a semester left in office and $143 million in school budget cuts left to be made, whether Flores will be able to bring her presidential power to bear remains to be seen.‘THEY’RE THE DECISION MAKERS’Even before a wave of budget cuts rocked the College last month, the UC’s influence on administrative decisions of critical import to student life was tested when the College announced that it would not offer structured programming during its first J-Term, a three-week period in January separating academic semesters. The UC, like the rest of the student body, was kept in the dark until after an announcement was made, Flores says. Though the announcement was made on April 6, the Council waited a week to bring student concern to administrators. At a Town Hall meeting held by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith on April 14 to brief members of the FAS community about looming financial challenges, Council members requested an answer to a prevalent student concern: which students would be allowed to stay on campus during the three-week period in January? Ten days later, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent a letter to the community announcing a student-faculty committee that would work to nail down J-Term logistics. The UC was able to choose two students—William R. Rose ’11 and Morgan L. Paull ’12—to serve in the group. On budgetary issues, Flores began to push harder for a seat at the table. At the same April 14 meeting, Flores inquired into the level of involvement the Council would have on budget cuts.“I was trying very hard to prevent or change how that May 11 announcement happened,” she says, referencing the first round of budget cuts—including possible limits to shuttle service and the elimination of hot breakfast in upperclassman Houses during the week—which many students protested, saying the cuts disproportionately affected student life. “I raised serious concerns about this first phase of this process, and they know that, but they made the decision and they’re the decision makers and that’s the way it goes and then you react,” Flores says.In meetings with Hammonds and Smith (Flores estimates that she has had five), Flores and UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 help the deans understand student concerns, says Paul J. McLoughlin, assistant dean of the College. “As with anybody, they are guessing [what the reaction will be] for an entire student population,” he says.Their positions afford Flores and McLeod some access to College decision makers, if not decision making, but even that is limited in scope—even more so for decisions of this magnitude.While community-wide e-mails such as those that detailed the $77 million of budget cuts do not generally come as a surprise to the two, they do not necessarily have strong influence over their content.“They are consulted,” McLoughlin says.SOCIAL SPACE UNCERTAINTY Even on the more level playing field of Council politics, Flores has faltered at times in applying Neustadt’s aphorism. As some UC members grew disillusioned with an inability to elicit responsiveness from administrators on the issue of social space, they opted to organize their own effort to provide said space to undergraduates. The debate on the matter came to a head during a May 3 meeting, during which the Council passed legislation authorizing a capital campaign in a down-to-the-wire vote, pitting McLeod against Flores. Early on in the social space debate, Flores advocated channeling energies through the University’s Committee on Common Spaces as a way to improve options. But the Council went forward with an alternate plan that skirted the need for administrative interaction: they decided to raise their funds independently in order to purchase property that could be made into a student center.Flores seemed to struggle to find her voice on the issue, vacillating between being a neutral facilitator and opposing the plan—but on the day the capital campaign prevailed, her face was one of clear disappointment. Over the course of the summer, four students hired by the UC will devote their energies to the capital campaign. The Council has made no formal agreement with the owners of any property as of yet, but a 45 Mt. Auburn St. property owned by the Foundation for Civic Leadership has been the only location discussed at UC General meetings or mentioned in legislation. Though not totally unheard of, it is uncommon for the majority of the Council to vote against the position of the President, and the time-consuming nature of the project means that the issue may well distract from any agenda Flores specifically hopes to pursue next semester.THE COMING YEAROver this past semester, Flores has  at times had difficulty cutting a powerful or persuasive figure with administrators as well as with fellow council members.Flores’ intended focus of the UC’s presidency from administrator and faculty relationships to student ones was countered by the sudden severity of the impact of the financial crisis on College life, forcing her attention toward the former group. By this point, circumstances, and perhaps administrative attitudes, had conspired against Flores, leaving her in a primarily consultative role. On the Council, Flores found herself on the losing side of the semester’s most prominent point of contention.Her struggles as an advocate in the former arena may more reflect the impact of the financial crisis on the University than any shortcomings of leadership. But with $143 million in cuts still to be made, Flores will need her powers of persuasion more than ever if she hopes to exert any substantial influence during her remaining semester in the presidency.—Staff writer Eric P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As one of 10 professors on the committee vested with implementing the College’s first curricular overhaul in 30 years, science professor John Huth does not take his obligations lightly. One morning this spring, he had to drop his daughter off at school, take his car to the mechanic, bike to his office, and change into a dress shirt there, all by 8:30 a.m.—to make it to a General Education committee meeting, where he would help hammer out course proposals for an hour and a half. It’s behind-the-scenes labors like these that have occupied the Gen Ed committee over much of the last two years, as the College looks to turn the Gen Ed legislation passed by the Faculty in 2007 into a concrete set of courses for incoming freshmen in the class of 2013—all of whom will fall under the new program. The work thus far has been more struggle than seamless shift.  There’s always an “enormous gap” between rules and practice, says the History department’s director of undergraduate studies, Daniel L. Smail, suggesting that it will be the work of the last two years, culminating next fall, that will be of most consequence for the new curriculum, and not its theoretical conception.  “If you take my view, it’s the practice that matters—not the legislation,” Smail says. “Curricular reforms are never going to create happy faculty or happy students, but we’ll find a way to make it work.” Other faculty members are similarly pragmatic.  The next three to five years will be a time for trial and error, says Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen—who will serve as Gen Ed’s administrative director next year.  “A new curriculum does not spring fully formed from Zeus’ head,” she says.  And indeed, Gen Ed has already begun to be faced with the questions that the conceptual outline of the program never had to address.  LITTLE VENTURE CAPITALThe problem of resources—both in terms of financial support and faculty time—looms large over Gen Ed’s launch. The Gen Ed committee’s primary challenge has been to ensure that students have a wide enough variety of courses to choose from in the fall, according to former Gen Ed committee member Alexander N. Chase-Levenson ’08—placing the burden on professors to develop more offerings. “We can’t have anything new unless colleagues send us forward something new,” says Gen Ed committee member Julie Buckler, who is also a Slavic literature professor. Many more professors have sent in course proposals for existing Core courses than for new Gen Ed classes, according to Buckler.  But Gen Ed committee members say that they determined early on not to provide monetary incentives or teaching relief to encourage professors to develop new Gen Ed courses. Buckler says that providing monetary incentives would open a “Pandora’s box,” and teaching students outside of one’s department is already an obligation for professors in principle. “We’ve given almost no carrots to dispense, and the only stick we’ve been given is to refuse proposals, which we don’t like to do unless it’s obvious that they don’t fit the Gen Ed mandate,” says Gen Ed committee member Edward J. Hall, who adds that he wishes that the body had the money to give professors summer stipends to create new courses. Since more classes still need to be developed, the Gen Ed committee will not allow caps on course enrollment (originally a tenet of the program) in front-of-the-book Gen Ed classes for the next few years because the menu of Gen Ed courses would not otherwise be varied enough to meet student demand next year, Kenen says. Meanwhile, as the Faculty shrinks—part of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’s plan to close FAS’ remaining $143 million deficit by reducing “people costs”—the resulting personnel situation makes it less likely that professors will extend themselves, according to several faculty members.  ENTRENCHMENTIn at least one case, the potential for creating new Gen Ed classes has been hindered by the restriction of the terms of the Gen Ed legislation—a difficult fit for some subjects.When Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw submitted a course proposal for his current Core class Social Analysis 10: “Principles of Economics” (Ec10) for credit in the “United States in the World” category in January 2008, the Gen Ed committee agreed that Ec10 “didn’t belong” in the category the way it was, according to former Gen Ed committee member Alexander “Zander” N. Li ’08. So, the committee rejected the longstanding class. But Mankiw would not take no for an answer. He resisted the committee’s suggestions to tweak Ec10, either by giving it more of a focus on current events or historical context to fit the “United States in the World” category, or more mathematical rigor in order to make it fall under “Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning,” according to Li. Although Mankiw declined an interview request for this article, he wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson in April 2008 that the Task Force on General Education had “inadequate appreciation of the role of analytic social science,” and that the debate over where Ec10 fits in Gen Ed is “a symptom of these flaws.” The Economics Department’s leadership—which similarly felt as though quantitative social science had been left out in the cold—stood with Mankiw in solidarity. According to several Gen Ed committee members, department chair James H. Stock and director of undergraduate studies Jeffrey A. Miron visited a Gen Ed committee meeting to argue that Ec10 still belonged in the “United States in the World” exactly as it was.  According to former Gen Ed committee member Chase-Levenson, Stock seemed to be “chafing” at the idea that he had to justify Ec10’s place in Gen Ed at all. At the meeting, according to Gen Ed committee members, Stock shifted impatiently in his chair and said he had to meet with an important Federal Reserve official within the hour, and he expected that Ec10 would get approved before he left. Ec10 did not enter Gen Ed so easily.  The same back-and-forth between the Gen Ed committee and the Economics department dragged on through the spring, without reaching a resolution until the summer—when some of the committee was not aware and did not have a say.  FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in a recent interview that he played his part “behind the scenes” in getting Ec10 approved. According to Hall, administrative pressure forced Harris and Kenen to approve Ec10. Harris did not inform the committee until the fall that the class had been approved to count toward either “United States of the World” or “Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning” if taken for the full year—but not both. Kenen, Harris, Miron, Stock, and Mankiw all declined to comment on the specifics behind Ec10’s approval.Since Gen Ed lacks a clear category for economics, economists have met the curriculum with indifference or hostility.“I don’t see how you can possibly evaluate different things without knowing some microeconomics that’s global or national,” says Economics Professor Ariel Pakes. “We should be producing intelligent citizens.”Although the department is Harvard’s largest in terms of concentrators, only one Economics course in Gen Ed so far was designed specifically for the new curriculum.Like their colleagues in Littauer, according to Smail, historians find Gen Ed’s intellectual structure to be problematic—particularly because the lack of a straightforward historical requirement, in contrast to the Core’s two Historical Study categories.  Adam G. Beaver, the History department’s outgoing assistant director of undergraduate studies, says that he finds Gen Ed to be an “inferior, warmed-over version of the Core,” which—while seeking to produce global citizens—should teach students where they came from as well as where they are going.  But Beaver adds that the department views submitting a variety of course proposals to the curriculum as the best way to ensure that students outside the concentration still appreciate history. Some professors have been less optimistic, declaring that Gen Ed’s structure is too flawed to survive without requiring some restructuring. “I suspect that Gen Ed in its present form won’t last quite as long as the Core did before it had to be revised,” says History of Art and Architecture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger. A committee will be appointed to review Gen Ed’s progress in 2012—five years after the May 2007 Faculty vote when the legislation was approved.LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION In spite of these hurdles, Gen Ed boosters still emphasize the program’s potential for innovative pedagogy and greater flexibility for students’ schedules—as long as professors put in the time to develop new classes. Both committee members and professors emphasize that a wider variety of classes can count toward Gen Ed in contrast to the Core—either in terms of departmental alternatives or more novel courses.While Core courses were required to have a midterm and final exam and were not allowed to cap the class size at a small number, plans call for Gen Ed classes to take any number of shapes.To try to help fulfill Gen Ed’s innovative potential, the Gen Ed committee has directed professors to the Provost Fund for Instructional Technology and the Bok Center to help give them guidance and funding, according to Kenen. A few Gen Ed classes are trying to draw students in with different pedagogical techniques, including a greater use of technology. East Asian Studies professor Shigehisa Kuriyama ’77 put a three-minute course trailer online for his offering Culture and Belief 11: “Medicine and the Body in East Asia and Europe” and required students last fall to create an iMovie every week to respond to the readings. Kuriyama says that those assignments encouraged students to do all the readings and think about them thoughtfully—in contrast to the way students prepare readings for weekly sections in many classes. But not all professors are optimistic that technology alone will be able to carry the curriculum. “It’s not a magic bullet,” former Dean of the College and Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 says of the use of technology in the classroom. TRANSFORMING INTO SOMETHING ‘TRANSFORMATIVE’ The Gen Ed committee dedicated its first few months to trying to define what kinds of classes would fit into each of the eight categories mandated by the Gen Ed legislation of 2007, according to committee members—an indication of just how vague its terms were viewed to be.  But over time, the committee has framed the openness of the legislation’s wording as an opportunity to encourage professors to teach whatever they want, however they want, to make their field of expertise accessible and exciting to non-concentrators. Gen Ed committee members say they hope that the lessons students learn in Gen Ed courses will “stick” with them after they graduate and shape them into more thoughtful human beings.“The Core was in some ways linked to the academy or to have a better sense of why academics do what they do,” Kenen says. “Gen Ed is more about how this body of knowledge is going to affect who you’re going to be.” Meanwhile, Harris—forever a 4:50 a.m. riser—is still visiting departments, seeking to recruit courses. Kenen is still organizing papers in her office in University Hall and working out logistical issues with administrators. And Gen Ed committee members are trying their best to ramp up enthusiasm. The attitude is a shift from the Gen Ed committee’s original outlook when they first met in the fall of 2007. “As a curriculum, as a grouping of categories, it would be hard to say that anyone was genuinely excited about it,” former Gen Ed committee member Li says of the group, adding that none of them saw it as a “radical shift” from the Core. Buckler says she hopes that students will find Gen Ed courses to be “an actual experience that really counts for something.” “[Gen Ed classes] should feel real—not something you just have to sleepwalk through so you can check off the box,” Buckler says. “It shouldn’t feel arcane or ‘academic.’ It should feel like a mind-opening kind of experience—accessible yet really stimulating, even transformative.” She paused and chuckled. “Even though that’s kind of idealistic.” —Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the College’s massive curricular review now in the rearview mirror, four individual departments conducted academic overhauls of their own late this year, revamping their concentration requirements to appeal to a wider variety of students.English, Classics, Music, and Astronomy modified their undergraduate programs this past year to give their concentrators greater flexibility and more accessible options.Many departments say that they wanted to de-emphasize preparing their concentrators for future academic work in the field, prioritizing a compelling introduction to the subject matter instead.“We did this because we didn’t think the concentration should be pre-professional scholarly training,” says Mark J. Schiefsky, the Classics department’s director of undergraduate studies, while explaining why the department decided to eliminate its long-standing (and notoriously rigorous) general examinations.“We’re supposed to be offering something that’s of much broader appeal and utility to the students,” says David Charbonneau, the Astronomy department’s director of undergraduate studies, who pioneered that department’s curricular overhaul.He adds that while the old Astrophysics requirements prepared students well for graduate school, newly developed offerings will be of much broader appeal to students who wish to go into other careers, such as science journalism.SNOWBALL EFFECTNone of this year’s concentration overhauls were directly spurred by the recent College-wide curricular review that has helped pave the way for the full launch of a new General Education program this fall, but the modifications reflect an atmosphere of curricular transformation, according to some professors.English Professor Elisa New says that although her first two attempts at revising the English concentration flopped, the College’s curricular review—initiated by her husband, former University President Lawrence H. Summers—helped the reform movement within the English department gain “momentum.”The “idea that the rest of the world was reforming itself” helped convince a number of English professors that it was time to review their own requirements, New says.Music department chair Anne C. Shreffler says that the curricular review helped professors think more creatively about their own departments’ curricula.“As you’re thinking about Gen Ed, you don’t want to think about it in isolation,” she says. “You want to think about the whole experience that students have, and obviously the concentration is a huge part of their experience.”The increased departmental emphasis on the needs of students not bound for graduate school appears consistent with the final report of the College’s Task Force on General Education, which emphasizes that since only a small fraction of graduating seniors plan to enter academia, scholarly training is comparatively less important than the sensibilities necessary to make thoughtful decisions in the world.This heightened focus on practice over scholarly theory is best reflected by the Music department’s decision to embrace musical performance.Chamber music and conducting courses will finally count toward concentration requirements, and students can qualify for honors by performing a recital at the end of senior year rather than writing a thesis.Recently tenured music professor Alexander Rehding overhauled the syllabus for Music 51: “Theory 1” when he took the reins this past year—not only by making it a divisible course, but also by encouraging students to compose and perform in many genres. The previous version of the class was less free-wheeling, focusing on the Bach chorales as the basis of learning in “a very controlled environment,” according to Rehding.Rehding says he hopes that the new Music 51—as well as the revamped Music concentration as a whole—will appeal more to students who may lack classical training, but like to play GarageBand or sing in student groups like Kuumba.The new “era of globalization” to which the Final Report of the Task Force on General Education repeatedly refers has also found its way into the Music curriculum—which has focused mostly on Western greats like Bach and Beethoven.Now, Music concentrators will be required to take a class in non-Western music—Music 51c: “World Music History and Repertory”—which will be taught next year for the first time by Music and African and African-American Studies Professor Kay K. Shelemay.FLEXIBILITY BUILT ON A ‘COMMON GROUND’This year’s concentration changes also reflect a desire to give students leeway to pave their own path within their concentration—but not before they take classes that ground them in the framework of the field.The English department has slashed most of its requirements—including its “Major British Writers” series, English 10a and 10b—in favor of granting its concentrators more electives. But the reduction has come with a renewed commitment to “common-ground” courses.Starting next year, English will require concentrators to take one class in each of four areas: “Diffusions,” “Arrivals,” “Poets,” and “Shakespeares.” Four classes will be offered per category per year, and they will be capped at around 25 students, according to Daniel G. Donoghue, the English department’s director of undergraduate studies.English concentrators—too often inundated with large lecture classes—have been asking for smaller classes for a long time, according to New, the English professor.In the renewed “Astrophysics” concentration (“renamed from Astronomy and Astrophysics”), a similar movement for common-ground courses is taking place. Concentrators will be required to take the newly created classes Astrophysics 16: “Stellar and Planetary Astronomy” and Astrophysics 17: “Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy” in the hopes that the courses will foster excitement about astronomy early in their undergraduate careers, Charbonneau says. The department has also added three more Astrophysics classes requiring only a basic level of proficiency in physics and math to make the subject accessible early on.Originally, it was not unheard of for concentrators to take only physics and math prerequisites for the first two years so that they could study astronomy at a high level in their junior and senior years—a sequence that concentrators say drove some students away.ONE SEMESTER LESSAll four concentrations being modified have reduced the total number of concentration requirements to compensate for students’ now delayed concentration declaration date, which was moved from the end of freshman year to the end of sophomore fall during the curricular review in 2007.The Astrophysics concentration has reduced the number of its basic requirements from 16 to 12, English has reduced the number from 12 to 11, Classics has reduced it from 12 to 11, and Music has reduced it from 14-15 to 13.Schiefsky, the Classics department’s director of undergraduate studies, says that it would be unrealistic for the department to expect students who started learning Greek and Latin in their sophomore year to take the “[Masters]-level” general exams at the end of their senior year.“With two years, you can’t expect the students to read this entire reading list with that kind of knowledge of ancient languages because—poor souls—they didn’t have the time to acquire this knowledge,” says Classics assistant professor Francesca Schironi. “You can’t read Pindar nonstop with two years of Greek.”Doing poorly in the six-hour general examination—which consists of sight translations and analyses of passages from writers ranging from Terence to Herodotus—can jeopardize Classics concentrators’ chances of receiving honors and even graduating.But the sort of broad-based, survey knowledge that the generals were intended to encourage won’t be lost. To compensate for the demise of the examinations, all concentrators will need to take at least one 112-level survey course of Latin or Greek literature—among the most rigorous offerings in the department.KEEPING IT SIMPLEIn the process of reviewing their concentrations, department leaders have sought not only to open their fields to a wider variety of students, but also to streamline. While joking that the Classics department’s concentration description is currently the longest in the Handbook for Students, Schiefsky has reduced the number of tracks within the Classics from seven to two: “Classical Languages and Literatures” and “Classical Civilizations.” Astrophysics has eliminated the difference between the “basic” and “honors” track, instead allowing any concentrator to choose to write a thesis as late as senior fall. The English department’s shift to only four non-elective requirements (one in each of the “common ground” areas) also bespeaks a more simplified structure, and the Music concentration has pared down a snarl of 14-15 requirements that befuddled even Shreffler, the department’s chair, in a phone interview.Department leaders are hopeful that by bringing their requirements up to date, more students will be encouraged to enter their niche fields—an imperative that becomes more pressing as the number of concentrators in Astrophysics, English, and Classics dwindles.But professors in the affected departments do not appear to be feeling a sense of crisis yet.“We will always be the minority,” Schironi says of those who study Classics. “I think it’s good we can take care of our students. Apparently our concentrators are very happy when they are here—unlike in other departments—so I don’t think we should become a big department in that sense.”—Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For months, Harvard was all talk.
Administrators spoke ominously of an impending fiscal crisis, dire warnings were issued in University-wide letters, and officials threw around numbers that spelled out a challenge greater than any that had confronted the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in decades.
But it remained in the background until last month, when the first round of cuts across the University’s largest school drew outrage from constituents who felt as though the real talk—which led to $77 million in cutbacks—had happened behind closed doors.
Even before the uproar—particularly strong among students, who criticized what they viewed as uninformed cuts to areas such as shuttle service and hot breakfast—some in FAS were beginning to agitate for greater transparency.
“We’re all partners in this enterprise,” Government Professor Robert D. Putnam told Michael D. Smith, the leader of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, at a town hall meeting in April. “And I think, at least, as one of the partners among the many partners, I would like to know a little more about how we got to where we are.”
It’s a question left hanging over the Faculty, as its leadership struggles to confront an unprecedented budgetary quagmire. The concern reverberates all the more as the school finds itself in the hands of unseasoned administrators—unfamiliar with the sort of fiscal magicking needed to unite a disparate and confused Faculty behind deep budget cuts. 
In a projected era of dramatic restructuring, Smith, FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Brett C. Sweet, and Harvard Executive Vice President Edward C. Forst ’82 have yet to fully define what this means for the Faculty. And mounting uncertainty over the past year has unnerved them.
“We can gather ideas, input, and ensure the community understands the extent of the financial challenge,” Smith wrote in an e-mail to a student who requested anonymity to preserve relations with the administration, “but there will always be a part of this process that must occur thoughtfully and quietly behind closed doors.”
THE COMMUNICATOR
Not even the worst financial crisis could convince Michael D. Smith to forgo his usual morning work-out sessions. The Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences wakes up well before 5 a.m., and generally warns against e-mailing him past his usual bedtime of 10 p.m. A computer scientist by training, Smith is all discipline, method, and very little madness.
This is the man who, upon being named dean, needed multiple meetings with his predecessor David R. Pilbeam to review a sheet of paper with a list of items Pilbeam thought would require particular attention. But Smith didn’t want the crash course in deanship to stop there.
“We went over my calendar,” Pilbeam recalls of an early encounter with Smith prior to his appointment. “He’d say, ‘What’s that? What’s that meeting? What do you do here? Who’s involved here?’”
But when Smith hit his second year, the answers came far less easily. The deanship of the Faculty has become “one of the most unenviable jobs in the world,” says History of Art and Architecture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger, an outspoken regular at Faculty meetings. With the financial crisis rocking a school accustomed to expansion, it became increasingly clear that cutting coffee and cookies from afternoon meetings would do little to save the strapped FAS budget.
In April, Smith unveiled “reshaping”—a general charge to implement broad structural changes that have yet to be determined. The news came a few weeks after the University announced in mid-March that the endowment payout—the school’s chief source of revenue—would fall by more than 15 percent over the next two years. “Reshaping” had replaced “resizing” (what happened to the coffee at afternoon meetings) as the new buzzword. The concept arose organically from University-wide discussions, Harvard President Drew G. Faust says, but the word ultimately came from Smith. “Do you like it or not?” Smith asked during a recent interview.
Coining the argot that would come to pervade discussions over the past few months is not foreign territory for Smith, whose habit of careful wording often frustrates Faculty members seeking meaning behind the lingo.
When asked to clarify the term “reshaping,” Smith repeatedly turns to the Faculty, casting his non-answer as an opportunity for professors—particularly those in the working groups—to propose “innovative” solutions for the remaining $143 million deficit. When asked to explain the growth of the administration in the past few years, Smith reverts to stock optimism: “I’m a very forward-looking person,” he says. When asked to comment on budget plans that could impact a particular group of people, Smith responds by simply affirming his commitment to supporting them.
“It’s not been transparent,” said a professor who requested anonymity to preserve his relationship with the University. “As a result, a lot of the faculty think that it has been less than thoughtful so far.”
The administration’s vague responses and deflections may reflect a lack of any current plan. “I don’t think there’s some big proposal sitting in the wings that is the secret strategy for solving our budget shortfalls,” says Allan M. Brandt, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
But the absence of any clear directive has cast doubt on Smith’s own grasp of the situation. “The Dean doesn’t exactly know himself what this ‘reshaping’ will mean,” said Classics Department Chair John M. Duffy, calling Smith’s dialect “a visionary approach without exactly having a vision.”
“The process can work much more efficiently if we have a greater sense of the vision of the leaders of the University on what their large priorities are,” says former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68. “To really make large scale changes, I think you need a somewhat stronger hand—a stronger hand that’s informed and consultative.”
With just two years of mid-level administrative experience at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences under his belt, the former Associate Dean for Computer Science and Engineering has been tasked with a charge of unfamiliar magnitude. Prior to his appointment, Smith was less than publicly active in Faculty affairs; he says he attended meetings “when appropriate.” But Smith wasn’t planning on exploding onto the scene anyway.
“He has the soul of a swimmer,” Lewis says of the Princeton graduate, who swam for his alma mater and regularly swims to this day. “He has a very low heart rate, he does not get excited, and he’s extremely steady, deliberate, and non-reactive.” As Pilbeam observes of Smith, “You rarely see him in any mode other than calm.”
For some, Smith’s unflappable nature is a steadying force in the midst of a financial maelstrom. Faust praised her handpicked dean as one whose guiding hand has been “very steady at a time that has been one of great pressure.” Unfazed even as students and staff noisily protested outside the windows of University Hall during the year’s last Faculty meeting, the computer science professor has a distinctively scientific—perhaps even stoic—approach to the difficulties of the budgetary crisis.
“He’s hard to read,” Lewis says. “I’ve never seen him angry, I’ve never seen him impatient.”
It’s a demeanor reflected in Smith’s former life as co-founder of the software company Liquid Machines, where co-founder Arny Epstein says Smith approached challenges in a measured, methodical way. At the last Faculty meeting, Smith compared the problem of closing the FAS deficit to “what I see when I’m designing an engineering problem.”
“He’s an engineer, so he comes at problems very deliberately,” says Computer Science Professor and former colleague J. Greg Morrisett. “He tries to understand the problems and the constraints and optimize and work with the best solution.”
Although every budgetary plan eventually “rolls up” to Smith’s office for final review, his purview is much too vast to allow much attention to details. “I did not go through all the different proposals from all the different units. That would be crazy,” Smith said in an interview last week, about proposals for cuts sent in by units over the past few months. Instead, he focuses on recommendations flagged as “affecting multiple units” or with far-reaching consequences.
“You have people who work with you and work for you so you don’t have to literally know absolutely everything,” Pilbeam says about the role of FAS dean. “But you certainly have to give the impression you do.”
As the leader of over 20,000 people, Smith is less of a micro-manager, and more of a communicator—working to present a coherent message for a disparate community. 
“The role of a dean certainly has a public face to it. You have to represent the faculty to the outside world,” Pilbeam says. “Ultimately, what you say and how you say it is yours.”
After the University learned that the endowment had fallen a precipitous 22 percent in December, Smith devoted the bulk of the two subsequent Faculty meetings to explaining the looming budgetary shortfall with powerpoints and hand-written figures—a function that professors came to expect in their dean.
But after two years at the helm, the honeymoon phase has passed, and there is growing impatience at the vagueness “reshaping” has come to represent. “There are a lot of open questions at this point,” Hamburger says. “I wish Dean Smith well.”
THE WINGMAN
Smith needed advice.
Faced with an endowment in free fall in late October, he arranged a meeting with former FAS Dean Henry Rosovsky, who had once weathered a recession of his own at the FAS helm. Smith brought one person with him.
Brett C. Sweet remains unknown to many professors and staff, but the FAS dean for administration and finance has gained attention in tandem with the increasing fiscal pressures. Smith first called attention to his financial guru at the November Faculty meeting: he had asked “Brett Sweet and others” to research Harvard’s coping mechanisms during past recessions. In a rare moment of uncertainty at the next meeting, Smith stopped mid-thought to double-check a fact with Sweet, who sat on the sidelines. “Yes,” Sweet quietly affirmed, nodding.
Though new to Harvard, Sweet is not unfamiliar with university finance, arriving on campus in 2008 after serving as executive vice president for administration and finance at Baylor College of Medicine. Sweet stepped into a redefined executive dean’s position that had previously been held on an interim basis. But he had barely enough time to adjust to his new office in University Hall before he had to add the fiscal fate of the Faculty to the top of his to-do list.
While department heads scrambled to draft proposals for 15 percent cuts in their budgets in accordance with a December directive from Smith, the former cryptographic researcher emerged from the frenzy of the financial uncertainty as the “point person,” the man tasked with setting fiscal policies to close a gaping deficit. Sweet—who often flanks Smith in various meetings with FAS administrative deans—knows the numbers well enough to tell units how particular proposals for budget cuts will save, or perhaps even cost money.
“He was all about the impact,” says Robert G. Doyle, FAS Associate Dean, who sends the budgets for the five administrative units under his purview directly to Sweet. “Brett Sweet is concerned about the impact of the reductions that he and others recommend, but it is Mike Smith who is the bottom line.”
Since Smith warned the Faculty of severe budget reductions, Sweet has been advising the individual departments and centers through the budget planning process by providing guidance in line with fiscal recommendations from central administration, according to Brandt. 
Described by Kimberly C. David—Baylor’s vice president of finance and planning who worked closely with him—as “very driven” and “a roll-up-the-sleeves guy,” Sweet’s intensity is apparent in his work today. “He packs a lot into a conversation, but he listens at the same speed,” says Nancy M. Cline, head administrator of Harvard College Library. “He puts an awful lot into a very short amount of time.”
Carolyn Sweet remembers her son in his pre-Naval Academy years as a “curious” boy with a penchant for mathematics. Sweet, who graduated second in his high school class, was always a bit precocious for his peers: “I said, ‘Remember, you’ve got to have patience because things that come easy for you, don’t come easy for most of us,’” Carolyn Sweet recalls telling her son. Once in the Navy, the Sioux City, Iowa native served as a nuclear submarine officer and sang in the Navy choir, once even performing for Queen Elizabeth, Mrs. Sweet says.
Though Sweet’s mother says her son often keeps in touch, she notes that he is careful to keep quiet details of his job at Harvard, explaining that there are “things that are relatively private in his job—he keeps it that way, so there’s a lot we probably don’t know.”
It’s an attitude evident in interactions with the press. In one instance, Sweet falsely accused two Crimson reporters of breaking into the FAS finance office. “This is bigger than your student newspaper,” he said of the importance of keeping budgetary information confidential. “This is bigger than an individual town.”
THE LIAISON
Edward C. Forst ’82 may not be known for his intimidating stature, but it has proved useful fodder for his self-effacing sense of humor.
“Don’t ask me to stand up,” he quipped at his 20th reunion dinner, when he rose from his chair to make a toast. “I’m standing up,” he assured the audience.
Harvard’s first executive vice president arrived last September fresh from 26 years on Wall Street and brought a personal charm to a position that would require great collaboration across the historically decentralized University. “He has a great sense of humor—very disarming in that way,” says the University’s Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore of his colleague.
Forst, who “hit the ground running” in June before his official start date, soon became one of Faust’s closest advisers, University Provost Steven E. Hyman says  of his “administrative twin.” In the newly created role of EVP, Forst was responsible for managing Harvard’s finance, administration, and human resources offices—all of which previously reported directly to the President. And Forst—as well as his financial expertise—has proven invaluable to Faust over the past year, as he accompanies her to meetings with deans at the various schools and leads difficult but necessary conversations about Harvard’s financial state.
“Every single day is about serving the President,” Forst says, leaning across the table, his eyes bright in earnestness. “We were quickly in the middle of this financial crisis—that’s not something that we really thought was happening in the world, let alone happening at Harvard, when Drew hired me in June.”
News of his plans to step down due to a self-stated desire to return to Wall Street came as a surprise to both administrators and faculty across the University last week. “I was surprised and disappointed,” Faust says. “But I understood.”
In just less than a year, Forst, who formerly served as Goldman Sachs’ chief administrative officer, had refinanced Harvard’s capital structure to reduce the University’s risk in its investment strategies. From his vantage point in Mass. Hall, Forst—described as “data-driven” by Christine M. Heenan, the University’s vice president for government, community, and public affairs—was able to identify inefficiencies in the University’s administrative system and consolidate University-wide procurement of resources, Shore says. Perhaps his years leading Goldman’s investment management division had shaped his way of thinking about cutting costs or, as he puts it, “investing smarter.” Shore notes that Forst saved $4 million just from negotiating better prices from outside vendors. “The process of challenging ourselves and reshaping our landscape—that’s new for us,” Forst says. “There are some things we can do smarter.”
Such knowledge has proven pivotal in Forst’s working relationship with Sweet, Forst’s counterpart in FAS. Forst says he meets every day with his own finance team or those at other schools across the University—and his meetings with Sweet and Smith have become particularly formative for a school currently struggling to develop a plan for revamping its administrative and programmatic structure. “I think the two of them have an extremely good working relationship,” Smith says of the financial duo.
Since Forst arrived at Harvard, Faust and the Harvard Corporation—the University’s chief governing body—have relied on his financial acumen and ability to reach out to the schools, and Faculty members have taken note of his high visibility. A regular at both social functions and meetings with high-level administrators, Forst describes his style as a “much more ‘pick up the phone and talk to people’—as there’s a real-time need to do that.” In response to Forst’s imminent departure, Lewis, the former College Dean, remarked, “His leaving seems to create a big hole for the President.”
Raised in Beverly, a middle-class neighborhood in Chicago, Forst “never did anything terribly wildly unusual,” his mother Ann Thole recalls of his early years. A graduate of an all-boys Catholic high school in downtown Chicago, Forst was the editor of the high school newspaper who exhibited “quiet leadership,” according to high school friend Peter Wuertz. Described by his three closest high school friends as the social planner of the group, Forst would later become president of the final club D.U. (which would eventually merge with the Fly) at Harvard and then serve as co-chair for his 20th and 25th reunions years, cultivating a reputation as a Harvard loyalist. 
“He was always just somebody who was very engaged in community, regardless of whether it was high school in Chicago or Harvard in Cambridge,” says David F. Sally ’82, who grew up with Forst in Chicago.
His uncanny ability to win people over stemmed from a genuine kindness fondly recalled by his close friends. His mother remembers Forst writing a letter to Notre Dame after having been accepted, begging the school to give his spot to a good friend who had been rejected. (“I don’t think he ever got a response,” she adds.)
“He was a straight shooter,” Wuertz says, “a no-BS kind of guy.” 
Forst’s mother would agree—except for the one rare instance in which he set off a firecracker in his bedroom by accident when home alone. “It burned through the carpeting,” she remembers. “He told me that it was the lady who cleaned the house and left the vacuum on to cause the wool to evaporate.”
“I did not buy it,” she adds.
THE DECIDERS
As the dust settles after campus-wide uproar following Smith’s announcement last month of deep budget cuts amounting to $77 million, faculty, students, and staff have grown increasingly concerned about the next step—which promises to have an even greater impact.
With $143 million left to cut over the next two years, many have begun to demand greater transparency in a process of downsizing that took constituents by surprise in its breadth and magnitude last month.
But while administrators have formed working groups to gather input, and prominently flagged a “Web resource” to communicate most, but not all, of the cutbacks, decisions regarding the next round of cuts appear likely to again be purview of the few.
“It would be most helpful to really know what the priories of the leadership are—where they consider some things untouchable and other things less valuable,” Lewis says. “Its very hard for anybody who’s not on the inside to imagine where you can save large amounts of money without knowing how much things cost.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly five decades ago, when one of her teachers called her to the front of her Atlanta public-school classroom, Evelynn M. Hammonds—the first black woman to serve as Dean of Harvard College—thought she would be recognized for an ‘A’ she had recently earned on a test. 
Instead, the teacher mockingly repudiated Hammonds’ work.
“If this woman could get an ‘A,’” the teacher said to the class, “then certainly all of you can.”
And according to outgoing Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith H. Kidd, who reflected on the anecdote of Hammonds’ youth that she once heard from the Dean herself, “Evelynn just decided to show him,” going on to excel in school despite stifling circumstances.
“She’s exceptionally bright,” Kidd adds. “And to be a smart black woman being bused in Atlanta? Well, when her back is up against the wall, she shows people how tough she is.”
In subsequent years, Hammonds maintained this reserved and “tough” personality. As a graduate student at Harvard in history of science, Hammonds was “poised,” “direct,” and “not effusive,” says her mentor, Professor Everett I. Mendelsohn. 
And currently, her actions as Dean reflect what her colleagues describe as a “shy and confident” demeanor. 
The challenges that greeted Hammonds in her professional life over the past year, as well as her reserved personality, have prevented her from gaining the trust of the student body as the chief College administrator. And in her personal life, the diagnosis of her wife, Alexandra, with cancer soon after her acceptance of the deanship has compounded the struggles of the past year.   
As Hammonds’ first year in office draws to a close, students and House officials say they still do not know who this intensely private leader is and feel she is disconnected from the undergraduate experience and unresponsive to their concerns. 
AN ‘INVISIBLE’ LEADER
After accepting the offer to serve as Dean, Hammonds told The Crimson that she hoped her “time as dean will be remembered as one where the students were engaged, students were listened to, students were involved in helping to produce a better quality of life and better educational opportunities.”
To that end, Hammonds says that one of her primary means of enmeshing herself in undergraduate life was to hold monthly teas with students, though she only held three in the last year. Many of these gatherings were restricted to certain groups of students or lotteried. 
“I think that she definitely was trying to create a comfortable way to interact with students,” says Andrea R. Flores ’10, Undergraduate Council president. “I think she’ll also expand on the concept next year.”
Though Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin says that Hammonds stays open to students’ perspectives by reading campus publications and House lists, the Dean has lacked a strong physical presence in the College, according to some students. 
“You know, I’ve heard the name, but I wouldn’t be able to recognize her if you showed me a line-up,” Tanille J. Paniogue ’11 says.
Citing a failure to create formal programming for next year’s inaugural “January Term” and a reluctance to divulge the contents of the Administrative Board Report—which proposed reforms to the College’s main disciplinary body—students have criticized the Hammonds’ administration specifically for a “lack of transparency,” says Christopher A. Johnson-Roberson ’11.
What students equated with secretive decision-making over the last year culminated in the town-hall meetings that followed the announcement of sweeping Faculty of Arts of Sciences budget cuts last month. 
Students attending these mid-May meetings say the cuts—from the elimination of hot breakfast to the possible scaling back of shuttle service—disproportionately affect student life, and argue that the student body had not been sufficiently consulted in the decision-making process. 
“I feel that [Hammonds] does try to present some sort of impression that she’s open to student concerns, but I don’t know how true that is,” Johnson-Roberson says. “She didn’t take the criticisms seriously enough or present a case that spoke to the actual issues.”
The student body is not the only constituency that has taken issue with Hammonds’ apparent neglect of opinions outside her office.
In an April letter to The Crimson, Mather House resident tutors spoke of the Dean’s tight-lipped nature regarding J-Term planning and her apathy towards their concerns, writing that they were “worried by Dean Hammonds’ refusal to say whether some Houses will be closed over January.”
And lower-level House administrators, who spoke to The Crimson on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, say that the areas of House life the Hammonds’ administration has targeted for budget cuts—particularly the possible consolidation of resident deans’ assistants—reflected a deficient knowledge of the House system, which they consider to be “instrumental” to undergraduate life at Harvard.
A DEANSHIP DERAILED
In contrast to the reputation Hammonds has gained over the past year, her full-time predecessor—Benedict H. Gross ’71, who left the deanship in August 2007—was noted for an inclusive leadership style.
“Dick was very jovial,” McLoughlin said, comparing Gross’ management technique with that of Hammonds, who administrators said tends to makes decisions behind closed doors. 
In 2007, then-UC President Ryan A. Petersen ’08 described Gross as a “friend to Harvard undergraduates” with a legacy that “improved Harvard College.” During his tenure, Gross was recognized for establishing the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub, the Lamont Library Café, the Student Organizations Center at Hilles, and the New College Theater, and for overseeing significant curricular change.
Still, both professors in FAS and College administrators say that it is unfair to compare the legacy of Gross to the “unprecedented” reality Hammonds is currently facing. 
“I think she’s had the worst first year possible,” Kidd says. 
When she was first appointed Dean in March 2008, Hammonds said in an interview with The Harvard University Gazette that she was cognizant of “many challenges facing the College.” But in multiple interviews with The Crimson over the last month, the Dean’s colleagues in University Hall say that she, like them, never anticipated the slew of obstacles to face the College administration this year: an unprecedented budget crisis, uncertain House Renewal, and traumatic events in the student population, including four undergraduate deaths and a shooting in Kirkland House last month.
McLoughlin, who serves as Hammonds’ senior aid, says that the Dean had hoped to use her “freshman year” to accustom herself to College life, including learning how to navigate the College bureaucracy. He and Kidd say that the nature of this year has prevented her from getting the chance to ease her way into the deanship. 
A FIERCE COLLEGE ADVOCATE?
Despite the student-held image of Hammonds as a disconnected bureaucrat, College administrators say that Hammonds has been a fierce advocate of College interests. 
Kidd says that the Dean is “a very strong proponent of the College and holds her own in meetings with FAS.” And though students criticized the timing of budget-cut announcements, which came during Reading Period, McLoughlin says that Hammonds had actually convinced other, higher-level University administrators to disclose the cuts before students left for summer. 
While administrators who work directly under her say that Hammonds has the best interests of students in mind, others acknowledge that a limited understanding of undergraduate life has undermined her ability to effectively represent student interests.
McLoughlin says that in the wake of the death of Peter Cai ’10 last October, Hammonds—who has a six-year-old son—“took to heart the tragic situation” and recurrently brought up her concerns about Cai’s death and the impact it had on his family and friends. But, McLoughlin says, it took that “tragic” event for her to realize that “House communities are so much closer than she knew.” 
As “a Black, lesbian, feminist, writer, scientist, historian of science, and activist”—a series of words Hammonds used to describe herself in a 2004 article in “The Black Studies Reader”—the Dean has made a point to emphasize diversity, having previously served as the University’s first senior vice provost for diversity and development. 
Colleagues point to her appointment of the College’s first black House Masters—Law School Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Law School lecturer Stephanie Robinson—in Winthrop House in February as a testament to her commitment to fostering diversity at the College.
But she may have also fallen short of expectations in some respects. Other than the Black Students Association, which has met with Hammonds multiple times this year, minority student groups say they have had limited, if any, direct outreach from Hammonds’ office. 
Queer Students and Allies co-president Christian L. Garland ’10 says that, though the College administration has been more open to working with his organization than in the past, Hammonds has not attended any QSA event.
But Hammonds appears to recognize her own lack of immersion in student life thus far.
“I have had the opportunity to interact with a number of students this year,” she wrote in an e-mailed statement. “It’s never as much as I would want, especially as a former faculty member who had the opportunity to interact with many students.”
GOING INTO NEXT YEAR
According to McLoughlin, Hammonds depends heavily on her staff to gather information to help her make decisions.
As a result, it remains to be seen how Hammonds will fare next year, as three key, seasoned administrators—Dean for Administration Georgene Herschbach, Associate Dean of Advising Programs Monique Rinere, and Kidd—leave the College, leaving a potential gap in institutional knowledge of student concerns. Their departure raises questions as to how both the College’s administrative structure and dynamic might change in the coming months. 
Having served as a House Master, FAS Registrar, and College administrator, Herschbach amassed a strong base of knowledge on how the College functions during her almost 30-year career at Harvard. She specialized in budgetary matters in her most recent position and delved into the academic realm of the College by expanding the Freshman Seminar Program, aiding in the creation of the Program for Research in Science and Engineering, and designing introductory science classes, including Life Sciences 1a and Physical Sciences 1. 
Under Rinere’s leadership as the first associate dean of advising programs, the office revamped the College’s advising system and created the Peer Advising Fellows program, Advising Fortnight, the sophomore advising program, and the online advising network portal.
And in her six years as associate dean of student life and activities, Kidd oversaw the openings of the Pub and the Harvard College Women’s Center, and has been an advocate for undergraduate extracurricular activities. 
In a testament to her reticent nature, Hammonds declines to reveal how she will fill these vacancies, or if she will alter the structure of the College administration altogether. 
Instead, she simply—and optimistically—referred to the repercussions of the loss of three integral members of her administration as another obstacle.
“With every challenge comes opportunity,” Hammonds wrote in an e-mailed statement. “So I feel confident that we emerge from the summer with the right structure for the College.”

Lowell House senior Brittany J. Smith ’09—one of two students linked to last month’s shooting in a Kirkland House entryway—will not receive her diploma at today’s Commencement exercises, the Boston Globe reported yesterday.Smith is the long-time girlfriend of New York songwriter Jabrai J. Copney, 20, who last month pled not guilty to charges of first-degree murder for the May 18 shooting that led to the death of 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby early the next morning.After the incident, Copney and the two individuals accompanying him allegedly fled the scene and headed toward Lowell—where Smith lives—and met an unidentified witness, said Assistant District Attorney Daniel Bennett at Copney’s arraignment last month. Copney then told the witness, “there was a fight, and then a shooting,” Bennett said.According to a Lowell resident who requested anonymity because they did not want their name associated with the incident, Harvard police officers stood outside Smith’s room the evening of the shooting and entered her room between 2 and 3 a.m. the next morning.Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin said they could not comment on Smith’s status yesterday. Harvard spokesperson John D. Longbrake also declined to comment.Smith was friends with Kirkland House resident Chanequa N. Campbell ’09, the other student who has been linked to the Kirkland shooting, said Campbell’s lawyer Jeffrey T. Karp.Campbell’s diploma has also been withheld by the College, Karp said. Campbell received two letters from Harvard administrators on May 22 informing her she must leave campus and would not be allowed to participate in any graduation activities, according to Karp.While Smith has kept mum about her potential involvement in the case and her relationship with Copney, Campbell has since taken part in interviews with multiple media outlets, challenging Harvard’s action and alleging that the University’s decision was motivated by bias. While she is not making an “overall claim of racism,” she told The Globe last week in an interview moderated by her attorney, “I do believe I am being singled out...I’m black and I’m poor and I’m from New York and I walk a certain way and I keep my clothes a certain way,” she said. “It’s something that labels me as different from everyone else.”University spokesmen have also declined to comment on Campbell’s status, citing policy not to comment on any disciplinary action involving individual students.Smith hails from the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, where she attended Frederick Douglass Academy in 2005. Smith could not be reached for comment yesterday.—Staff writer Lauren D. Kiel can be reached at lkiel@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Laura G. Mirviss can be reached at lmirviss@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Class of 2009 arrived on campus, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch were still solvent.But between freshmen move-in and the Office of Career Services Career Forum at the end of September of their senior year, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America and Lehman Brothers collapsed.And as might be expected in a time of economic turmoil, fewer seniors—usually looking for their first full-time jobs—were able to find work this year than in the recent past.In this year’s Crimson survey of over 500 seniors, 59 percent of those seeking employment said that they currently have a job lined up, a drop from 66 percent in 2008 and 73 percent in 2007.The economic slump will also impact the support Harvard provides to undergraduates—OCS, the Advising Programs Office, and the Bureau of Study Counsel are all either reorganizing their programs or, in some cases, cutting back due to the financial crisis.‘DEFNINITELY MORE COMPETITIVE’At the beginning of the economically tumultuous academic year, Robin Mount was appointed to head OCS as its interim director, replacing long-time head William Wright-Swadel, who left to take a similar job at Duke.As careers in finance and consulting became less attractive or available, the office shifted its focus toward other industries, with a new initiative called “turning up the volume on diverse career options.” While Mount said that the timing of OCS’ change in direction was coincidental, the new programming was particularly fitting for seniors who were turning away from or being edged out of the collapsing financial sector.Only 20 percent of seniors are entering finance and consulting this year, compared to 39 percent in 2008, according to Crimson surveys. “If one likes to work with numbers and statistics, one doesn’t have to do it on Wall Street,” OCS Associate Director Susan M. Vacca said. “One could do it in an arts organization managing a budget.”The office’s programming is now grouped into cluster areas including finance and consulting, creative arts, education, and poverty relief.“OCS has done an admirable job of shifting gears a little bit, demystifying careers other than those you can get to through e-recruiting,” Jesse M. Kaplan ’09 said.E-recruiting, OCS’ online recruiting database, is commonly utilized by seniors during the job search, particularly by those seeking careers in finance and consulting.But the job market may be forcing seniors to rely less on the on-campus recruiting system, one of OCS’ most widely used resources. According to the OCS Web site, 45 percent of seniors from the Class of 2008 participated in the program.However, the number of recruiters coming on campus is falling, and the jobs available are becoming harder to get.According to Mount, there were 10 percent fewer recruiters on campus in the fall of 2008 and 19 percent fewer this spring.Economics concentrator Trevor G. Frankel ’09 used on-campus recruiting to get his job at hedge fund MDT Advisers next year. He said his experience with OCS was positive, but emphasized that OCS should encourage people to locate jobs on their own. Ayla N. Bloomberg ’09 used e-recruiting in her job search, but accepted an offer that she found independently of OCS.“It’s definitely been more competitive,” she said of on-campus recruiting. “I stayed within the healthcare industry and had some more success with that than in other areas that I might have explored in previous years had the economy been better.”PROSPECTS FOR 2010The economic slump that hit this year’s graduating class will likely affect next year’s class as well, both via the weak job market and through cutbacks spurred by Harvard’s declining budget.According to Mount, 135 companies have signed up so far to recruit on campus next year, a 17 percent decrease from May 2008, when 162 firms had signed up. The registration period is not yet closed.OCS is also cutting one-on-one counseling during this July to save money on operating costs and is taking advantage of retirements to consolidate positions, Mount said. In addition, less food will be served at events and many of the publications put out by the office will be moving online.But, according to Mount, the OCS budget is unlikely to be cut further.“At a time when the economy’s struggling and students are looking for opportunities, it’s not a time we’re looking to reduce services to students,” she said.The office has collaborated with Harvard Student Agencies and the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard to initiate a new summer program, the “Innovation Space Summer Expansion.” The initiative will allow students to use its interview facility on Massachusetts Avenue as office space for developing entrepreneurial ideas, and will cost OCS little besides a water cooler and a few printers.CUTS IN ADVISINGBut other advising offices are suffering more than OCS from Harvard’s budget crisis.A document obtained by the Crimson last month described significant cuts to undergraduate advising, including the elimination of the concentration fair, the downsizing of Advising Fortnight, and the reduction of funding for meals hosted by freshmen advisers for their advisees.Like OCS, the Advising Programs Office will be moving publications online and cutting funding for food at events.The APO will also lose its current head, Monique Rinere, who will leave for a new post at Columbia in July.The Bureau of Study Counsel, which conducts personal counseling and academic advising and tutoring, is also examining plans to reshape.BSC director Abigail Lipson said “there are many, many things that will have to change,” but declined to give details on the plans being considered.“Our priorities for next year remain the same—to focus our availability during students’ busiest times of the year and to continue to offer services that support students’ learning and development,” she said.—Staff writer Danielle J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the financial giant American Insurance Group began wading into a world of new and complex financial instruments, putting hundreds of billions of dollars on the line, the company’s top brass was unconcerned.AIG had hired Gary B. Gorton—a financial economist at Yale—to use quantitative models to project the worst case scenario for the company’s balance sheet.Using historical data, the models predicted a rosy future not too-unlike the recent, prosperous past, giving AIG’s leadership confidence in entering uncharted markets.But by last September, one of AIG’s gambles had all but destroyed the institution—once the 18th largest public company in the world. To prevent an abrupt and potentially catastrophic collapse, AIG was forced to take a $182.5 billion lifeline from the U.S. government to cover losses that its forecasts indicated were never supposed to happen. Quantitative models like Gorton’s—equally likely to emerge on a dusty blackboard as the frenzied trading floor—have come under fire over the past year, which saw a seismic reshaping of the global financial landscape.Mere months later, academic economists are for the most part presenting a sanguine front to the world. Despite the unprecedented collapse of several Wall Street giants that relied on quantitative forecasting, they say that the fundamentals of quantitative techniques remain intact.But at the same time, there is a new note of humility—an explicit recognition that the world is complex, formulas are imperfect, and humans are fallible.THE GREAT UNKNOWNWhile debates continue to rage over the length, severity, or causes of the financial crisis, economists have agreed on one of its effects: a renewed caution about the predictive powers of mathematics.Harvard Business School professor Robert C. Merton says that finance, unlike other subfields of economics, had never claimed to forecast the exact movements of securities prices.Merton was a co-recipient of the Nobel prize in economics in 1997 for his work on the Black-Scholes model, ubiquitously used by traders to price options and determine expected volatility.But he has also gained notoriety in financial circles for his membership on the board of directors of Long-Term Capital Management, whose collapse threatened to imperil the global economy in 1998, prompting a government-orchestrated intervention.“If you look at the options model, it’s all about understanding the risk term,” he says. “Most of the outcomes aren’t forecastable, so uncertainty is the biggest permeator here.”And a “fundamental uncertainty principle,” according to economics professor Jeremy C. Stein, means that the best model fed an infinite amount of data would still fail to predict securities prices perfectly. Relying heavily on this dataset and acting according to the outputs of the models would change economic parameters so that the original assumptions are no longer valid.“Unlike in the physical sciences, where with enough data you can learn what the truth is, in markets the truth is moving around a little bit,” Stein says.In a fundamentally uncertain world, placing too much faith in predictions, no matter how sophisticated, can be a mistake.“[People] think of us as having much better forecasting skills than we really do have,” Merton says.HUMAN ERRORQuantitative techniques may have generated inaccurate predictions, but the final responsibility for the poor decision-making that ensued rests with the individuals involved and not the forecasting methods, many economists said.“Models are nothing but an extension of human beings,” Merton sys. “In the real world of finance, no one turns the computer on and walks out the door.”But in the last few years, a trickle of physicists, computer scientists, and mathematicians to Wall Street has diluted the level of understanding of the formulas and algorithms processed by their high-powered computers, says economics professor David I. Laibson ’88. In certain cases, some economists say, their lack of economic intuition may have caused them to make incorrect assumptions that biased the models.One of the quantitative modeling concepts that has come under heaviest fire is Value at Risk, which, unlike Black-Scholes, was born of the demands of the trading floor.VaR projects the maximum loss a company will suffer in a given day assuming typical market conditions, such as 95 or 99 percent of the time. Senior management can then control the risks assumed by the firm by directing traders to increase or decrease the VaR, depending on the company’s appetite for risk.But VaR modeling does not describe events that occur the other 1 percent of the time. In the New York Times best-seller “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,” Nassim N. Taleb, who has held positions at Columbia, Wharton, and NYU, argues that these events—which he dubs “black swans”—are the most important determinants of the course of history. Models that fail to account for them are all but useless. Even so, Merton insists that the “degree of sophistication” and the “mindset” in risk management have greatly improved in recent decades, since VaR was developed and popularized. But as its use became widespread, its users became, on average, less knowledgeable about its application than the group of traders who created it in the late 1980s and early 1990s.“Some people thought they could hire a physics guy and put him to work in a ratings agency with no economics experience,” says Laibson, adding that economists recognized the inherent dangers of these models long before the current crisis.“The world has learned a lesson, but it hasn’t changed my world view,” he says.Merton questions whether the systemic failure of global financial systems can be attributed entirely to over-reliance on quantitative models.“Will there be cases where people over-relied on models? Absolutely,” he says. “But is that a general proposition? Not so clear.”In some situations, senior management may have failed to understand the models or may have ignored their implications—such as when they advise reducing profit to control risk, even when other companies are pressing forward.While backward-looking VaR models relied entirely on data from past years, forward-looking VaR models were able to pick up on the increased volatility of the market before securities prices took a nosedive, says Aaron C. Brown ’78, a risk manager at the quant hedge fund AQR Capital Management. But when the forward-looking VaR suddenly rose—reflecting a dramatic increase in risk—warning signs went unheeded.“People have a tendency to ignore that and to say, ‘Well, just clean up the numbers,’” Brown says. “If the model never surprises you, the market surprises you instead.”In light of these problems in the risk management process, Merton argues for more education in quantitative techniques, instead of shying away from them altogether.“One of the things I think comes out of this is a greater need for modern financial training and knowledge,” he says. “We should be teaching more about modern finance and these tools, not less.”HARD TO STUDYWhile economists disagree over whether anyone could have predicted the snowball reactions of the financial markets, they acknowledge that such large and calamitous events are relatively unstudied.Some say the scant attention paid to market meltdowns was a natural product of their infrequency, despite their outsized ramifications. The last systemic market failure—the events precipitating the Great Depression—has been studied as a historical anomaly and not as a recurring event.But at the same time, economics as a field may be predisposed against forecasting the once-in-a-century catastrophes that result from market imperfections reinforcing one another.“There has been a visceral reaction of many economists toward building market frictions or inefficiencies into their models—but that’s changing,” says outgoing economics chair James H. Stock, pointing to the significantly higher degree of difficulty involved in solving models that include the possibility of extremely unusual phenomena.Other economists may not be asking the right questions, even before reaching the stage of setting up models.The pressure on academic economists to publish prolifically, especially at the start of their careers, tends to encourage them to focus on problems that existing analytical tools can solve.“The recipe for something to be a successful research project,” Stein says, “is that it has to be interesting to some people and has to offer an idea or tool that others can easily work with.”In this sense, running more sophisticated regressions on a dataset may appeal more to young economists than searching for the most appropriate use of models or optimizing the balance of qualitative and quantitative insight. The uncertainty surrounding such topics can deter students by their sheer difficulty, even if they may yield more interesting or informative answers.“The ‘arty’ part of it—how can you mix data and judgment—that’s a hard topic,” Stein says.COMMON SENSEAcademicians are increasingly echoing the public call to embrace “common sense” as a reality check when models output projections that suggest untenable growth.“I think we’ve learned a lesson about the limits of [quantitative modeling],” Stein says. “There’s a need to overlay it with softer, more qualitative judgment.”This approach strikes few as particularly novel—some well-performing hedge funds, for instance, have always relied on a global view of economic trends rather than heavily statistical data analysis. And “common sense” also applies to deciding which data points are relevant in any given scenario, making it relevant even in a quantitative modeling context.“Sophisticated analysts will combine many different tools—one part intuition, one part historical data, and one part mathematical modeling—to come up with good decisions,” Laibson says.In practice, though, moving entirely to the “common sense” approach on the trading floor is far from a panacea for the chaos wreaked by unusual events.Models may be imperfect, but so is human judgment. And firms trading thousands of different securities each day find it impossible to hire the manpower necessary to scrutinize each trade.“The trouble with common sense,” Brown says, “is that it’s expensive.” MOVING FORWARDDespite the much-changed financial landscape, many academics said there was no need to overhaul economic thinking.“I don’t think there’s any new particles being discovered,” Merton says, comparing the fundamentals of finance—market efficiency and risk-benefit analysis—to the building blocks of physical matter.While several major financial institutions have disappeared, leaving experts to sift through the wreckage, many Harvard professors said that the backlash on quantitative models was largely unwarranted. Furthermore, they say quantitative models have become so prevalent in recent years—used everywhere from hedge funds to central banks—that drastically curtailing their use would cause more harm than good.Laibson calls pundits’ suggestions that the failures of risk modeling demonstrate the failure of mathematical modeling at large an “extreme overreaction” to the events of recent months.“I’m quite convinced if we threw out all mathematics in our efforts to model the financial world, we’d be shooting ourselves in the foot,” he says.Economists acknowledged that the crisis has made it necessary to tweak models and redirect interest to questions that have previously received little attention. Economists should study how models can incorporate greater sensitivity to rare events, and how macroeconomic models can be better integrated with the outputs of behavioral finance models, says Stock.But at the same time, academics may generally be more reluctant than finance professionals to reject theories that seem to falter in the real world.“There’s a different mindset from the trading floor,” Brown says. “Traders have to cut losses at the first sign of trouble—academics want to dig deeper.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When former University President Lawrence H. Summers formally announced his resignation in 2006, several of his most loyal alumni supporters voiced their displeasure at his ouster with the largely symbolic threat of withholding all future donations.James B. Davis ’75 called it a “disgrace.”“So be it,” Richard A. Holt ’64 penned in an unpublished letter to The Crimson in 2006. “Henceforth, when the alumni fund solicitors call, I shall not donate so much as a penny to this shallow institution.”Following the installation of University President Drew G. Faust a year later, a more subdued alumni community withheld judgment as they waited for the soft-spoken Civil War historian to settle into her new role and introduce herself and her vision for Harvard.In the two years since then, Faust has made her introductory rounds within alumni circles, expanding her small posse of donor friends from her time as the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to include other prominent givers from the Summers era. But when Harvard’s $36.9 billion endowment plunged an unprecedented 22 percent in the four months leading up to Oct. 31, the former head of Harvard’s smallest school—with an operating budget of under $20 million—found herself thrust into the spotlight as a public figure tasked with bringing together the University’s traditionally disparate schools. Over the past few months, Faust has found herself in a communicative role, in which she has had to bring all constituents—faculty, students, staff, and alumni—to a common understanding of the state of the University.In response, donors have expressed warm support for Faust’s leadership in the face of extreme financial pressure, praising what they view as her transparent and cautious approach in identifying University priorities.“She’s very forthright, unadorned, and not one to gild the lily,” says Peter J. Solomon ’60, the founder of the New York-based Peter J. Solomon investment bank who has met with Faust on several occasions.CHANGING TACKAs the value of the endowment plummeted, donors have described Faust’s approach as direct and up-front in requesting their financial support to bolster the University’s cash reserves. Instead of winning donors over with plans for a new building dedicated to cutting-edge research, University leaders changed tactics and approached them for current use gifts and unrestricted funds to sustain Harvard’s core activities in the short-term.“We felt that it is very important to have resources to make immediate interventions that will have good outcomes in the long-term,” Faust says, citing the need for greater flexibility in diverting funds. Unrestricted funds can be used at the discretion of University leaders, and current use gifts can be spent immediately—unlike most endowment funds, which are designated for a specific purpose and have limits on yearly spending.Even more than other donations, such gifts represent a vote of confidence in the administration, since donors are in effect relinquishing the control they normally exercise over their contributions to the University. “[Donors] want their money to go to things that they really care about,” Mark Hissey ’84 explains, adding that donors do not necessarily question the responsibility of University leaders—instead, an inherent level of suspicion arises when giving to what some perceive as a “slush fund.”Fundraising numbers for the current fiscal year are not yet available, and the numbers for May and June—which comprise the final push for class reunion fundraising—typically boost year-end results. Thus far, University administrators say that donors have been receptive to the change in fundraising strategy. “Ask us 3 months ago and we would not have predicted it,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman says of the level of philanthropy as of early May. “We’re fortunate to have such generous alumni, but we’re very much in unprecedented territory.”DONOR APPRECIATIONFaust often emphasizes that Harvard is no longer in a position to think as a university with a $36.9 billion endowment, and donors acknowledge that reducing the scope of University activities and ambitions to those that a $24 billion endowment can support is not easy. Most give Faust credit for coping with the unprecedented fiscal challenges thus far. Most praise her transparency and relatively frequent updates on University budget planning—“People are grateful for the information,” Stephen R. Quazzo ’82 says. And most cite her mild-mannered charm and ability to put everyone around her at ease as the key strengths she brings to the presidency.But when asked to describe Faust’s long-term vision for the University, few alumni mention any specifics, though most express a general sense of confidence that Faust’s leadership will continue Harvard’s tradition of excellence. “It’s hard to say,” John F. Cogan, Jr. ’49 says, considering his recent dialogue with Faust about her plans for the future. “I don’t think you can make short-term decisions without a long-term vision.”While the economic downturn has forced Harvard to reconsider all aspects of its present operations, donors say they have faith that the University’s core initiatives will survive current cost-cutting measures.“I like to think, though I haven’t asked Drew the question directly, that the vision is really little different than what it had been before the financial crisis,” John A. Kaneb ’56 says. “But it may have to be achieved over a longer time frame than one might have thought, and perhaps a bit more modestly in some ways I can’t now foresee.”Faust describes the messages she has been sending to alumni as two-fold—Harvard must not only “adjust to a changed financial context” but also take advantage of the crisis to sort through University priorities going forward. “We must be in charge of change instead of being the object of change,” Faust says.But the changes the University has implemented thus far—including salary freezes, construction slowdown, and reduced faculty searches—have been incremental and measured in scope, and though Faust has yet to flesh out major structural changes, donors approve of the restraint she has shown in approaching budget cuts.“I think the fact that they’re being cautious and not doing anything out of the ordinary—I think there’s a lot of wisdom in that,” Hissey says. More drastic measures would have suggested less consideration for the “human impact” of inevitable changes at the University, Cogan says, adding that “there’s a high level of respect and confidence in what she’s doing.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months after the University first announced that it would be slowing construction of its much-anticipated Allston Science Complex, administrators have begun to carve out alternative accommodations for those researchers who had been promised space there. University Provost Steven E. Hyman said in a recent interview that he hopes the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute will have space in Cambridge by the beginning of 2011. But to make room, professors in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology will have to vacate their labs in the Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building by the spring of 2010.The renovated space in Fairchild and the adjacent Bauer Laboratory will be made “denser and more efficient” for the stem cell researchers. The new design, already used in the massive Northwest Science Building, separates administrative office space from the actual laboratories, which feature tightly packed rows of counters in a large open expanse.“Students and postdoctoral fellows can intermingle and talk to each other and learn not only from their own [Principal Investigator], but more easily from other people in the [Stem Cell] Institute,” says Hyman, a long-time proponent of stem cell research. “It’s also more cost-effective because more of the space can be used to generate research and research grants.”But some faculty say they think the changes are largely superficial, more indicative of a fad than actual improvement: “Why are miniskirts better than long skirts or pants? It’s a question of fashion,” says MCB Professor and current Fairchild inhabitant Guido Guidotti. “Now, the fashion is to have large labs where everybody’s together.”Some professors have also questioned the rationale for spending what is rumored to be tens of millions of dollars on laboratory renovations, while the Faculty of Arts and Sciences still has $143 million to cut from its budget over the next two years.Matthew Meselson, a distinguished MCB professor who has been in the Fairchild building for more than 30 years, took the podium at the last Faculty meeting of the year to ask administrators to reallocate the funds reserved for the renovations, which he said were estimated to cost at least $50 or $60 million. He added that such a move could help avoid some of the most damaging cuts looming over FAS.But University President Drew G. Faust responded by saying that those funds had been dedicated to development in Allston, and as such would be redirected to related projects and not “issues that you are all facing as a Faculty.”Several MCB professors scheduled for eviction from Fairchild have expressed concern over the past few months about the lack of consultation during the University’s decision-making process, noting that revelations of the move came as a total shock. Although professors have been meeting with architects since March, they continue to express confusion about the upcoming renovations.“I don’t know anything about them—that’s the problem,” Guidotti said resignedly in an interview last week. “There’s nothing you can say. You can discuss things when one’s opinion is asked before a decision is made. Once the decision is made, what’s the point of talking?”Faust first announced her decision to slow construction of the Allston Science Complex in February, citing financial difficulties caused by the economic downturn. Stem cell researchers—who have for years been dispersed across Harvard’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses—had been slated to move en masse to the Complex. To ensure that the Allston slowdown would not derail continued research progress, University officials opted to use existing lab space in Cambridge to accommodate the researchers.Planners ultimately chose the Fairchild Building, a roughly 30-year-old laboratory complex built specifically for biochemistry research that was even planned by a few of the current occupants.The labs of two acclaimed stem cell researchers, Douglas A. Melton and Kevin C. Eggan, are already in the building, but the University revealed in February that the entire structure would have to be vacated and completely renovated to make room for their stem cell colleagues. Faust said the new labs would be ready by 2011—precisely when the Science Complex had once been slated for completion.“There is extreme financial difficulty in the University and the decision was made to delay Allston,” says Catherine Dulac, chair of the MCB department. “We all have to accommodate some of the consequences.”With FAS now planning to revamp its administrative and programmatic structure, the University’s decision to reconfigure its limited laboratory space has irked affected MCB researchers who feel the move suggests an underlying bias towards more lucrative research.“I think it sends a message. It’s one thing to build a big stem cell institution in Allston, where you’re launching a whole special project,” said Jim Henle, an MCB lab administrator in Fairchild, in a March interview. “It’s another thing to displace a whole department and send them to who-knows-what netherland.”But the administration continues to say that no fields in the life sciences—or any departments for that matter—are being prioritized, and that the University had made a real effort to accommodate the needs of all researchers.“I realize there’s an inconvenience to MCB faculty, but we’ve really done our best to mitigate that,” says Provost Hyman. “They’re moving into a brand new building, they’re going from three buildings to two, and we’re trying to do other things to make it right for them.”After moving out of the Fairchild Building, the MCB department will consolidate into the newly-constructed and largely unoccupied Northwest Science Building and the Biological Laboratories. During the Fairchild building renovation, the Melton and Eggan labs will take up temporary residence in Northwest as well.While it is unclear if stem cell researchers will still eventually move to Allston, the current fiscal crisis has greatly complicated the University’s plans to bolster interdisciplinary science. “Allston is just one part of the University. All the education and science currently happening on this campus—that’s what we are all concerned about,” Dulac says. “What the solutions are, we have no idea. The discussion is just starting.”—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.                     —Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard College’s Administrative Board, often seen as a monolithic, stolid body, may see revisions to its policies and proceedings in the near future.Procedures regarding representation in Ad Board cases, the size of hearings, and the threshold for punishment, are often decried by students as either opaque or overly harsh. But Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds indicated that policy in these areas will be reworked in her presentation at this year’s final meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Other issues, such as the question of whether students will play a role in the disciplinary process, are still up in the air. The changes come after a year-long review process of the disciplinary body by the Ad Board Review Committee. Former Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 first proposed that the College review the procedures of the Ad Board in Spring 2007, and Interim Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam convened a small review committee in November 2007. The group presented its findings to Hammonds on March 6, many of which will be taken into account over the next year, Hammonds has indicated. And while many advocates for reform have applauded the proposed changes, without an undergraduate voice on the Ad Board, some feel that the student body will still be left in the dark.DUTIES OF THE RESIDENT DEANSOne of the most significant changes to the Ad Board process will be a shift in the role of House resident deans on the board.Currently, resident deans present students with their cases, often serving as representatives in hearings or advisors, yet they can speak against those same students in hearings in which the students are not present. Next year, the secretary of the Ad Board, currently Associate Dean of the College Jay Ellison, will present students with their cases, according to Hammonds.Students will also be allowed to select anyone in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as their advisor for Ad Board proceedings, according to former Undergraduate Council President Matthew L. Sundquist ’09. Sundquist was the only student member of the Administrative Board Review Committee.The new process will put less pressure on students to pick their resident deans as their advisors, committee members say, eliminating the deans’ “dual role” as advisor and the individual who takes their case to the Board.The current system creates a “conflict between the role of advocacy and prosecution,” said Max H.Y. Wong ’10, who has been before the Ad Board. “People don’t have anywhere to go for impartial advice.”Wong mounted a failed UC campaign alongside Charles T. James ’09-’10 that had Ad Board reform as a central tenet.Richard M. Losick, a biology professor who has been a vocal advocate of Ad Board reform and has served as an advisor to students who have gone in front of the board, agreed that resident deans often serve in a conflicted role.“The resident dean, who is supposed to be neutral, is supposed to be defense and prosecutor,” he said.The representative a student selects will also be able to have some influence on proceedings in front of the board.“Right now if you get Ad Boarded and you bring a non-member of the board, they sit behind you and can’t speak or participate,” Sundquist said.With the committee’s changes in place, advisors will be able to speak on behalf of students or ask for a pause in the proceedings to allow for a break from what Wong described as sometimes emotionally traumatic hearings. Advisors will also be allowed to see evidence in the case, Hammonds said.SMALLER HEARINGSEfforts are also being made to reduce the stress Ad Board meetings put on students. Currently, students waiting to go in front of the Ad Board are asked to sit in Lamont Library Café—a popular gathering place for students—until they are retrieved.Students then testify to the entire Ad Board committee, which is comprised of an average of 25 faculty and administrators.The review committee’s proposals suggest students meet with a subcommittee of six members—three faculty and three administrators—that would then report to the board as a whole. And they will not have to wait in Lamont Café anymore. The committee recommends that students have a private alcove in which they can wait with their advisor, Sundquist said.The advisory committee’s recommendations also suggest that less serious cases not be sent to the Ad Board. Instead, House administrators should handle smaller cases, the committee encouraged, doling out official “House warnings” as punishments.According to Losick, a former Ad Board member, going before the board can be a punishment in itself in cases, when students are only accused of minor transgressions and are forced to cope with the sometimes stressful policies of the Board.“People have been threatened with the Ad Board for propping a door open in their room,” Sundquist said. “That’s a local issue that can easily be dealt with at a house level.”BURDEN OF ‘PERSUASION’One key reform is a new standard for guilt before the Ad Board.Right now, no formal threshold exists by which the board should decide whether or not a student should be punished.  Next year, the board will have to be “sufficiently persuaded” of guilt in order to exact penalties, Sundquist said.Such a benchmark was much sought after by those unhappy with current Ad Board policy.“It was my impression,” Losick said about the current standard, “that in practice it was often ‘more likely than not.’”According to the Ad Board’s guide for students, in 2007-2008, about half of disciplinary cases put the students who went before the board on probation or required them to withdraw for some period of time, typically one to two years.FACULTY LEGISLATIONReview committee members will also be working with deans this summer to draft legislation for the faculty to amend student handbook policies on the Ad Board.Some major changes that will require a vote of the full Faculty include increasing the range of punishments available to the Ad Board in cases of academic dishonesty, re-examining Harvard’s dismissal policy, and clarifying the definition of inappropriate collaboration in the handbook, Sundquist said.A STUDENT VOICE?The next step, many undergraduate proponents argue, is student participation in Ad Board proceedings, but there is little guarantee that this round of reforms will address the issue.Andrea R. Flores ’10, the current UC president, said she believes that having students on committee is “necessary.”“All of [the suggested changes] are important and will be necessary and helpful,” Flores said. “They should not be in any way diminished, but I think everyone would agree that the biggest part of the question hasn’t been answered.”But student involvement is still up for consideration. One option currently being floated is giving students a choice between two disciplinary committees—one with students and one without, according to Donald Pfister, a professor of systemic botany and a member of the Ad Board Review Committee.“Undoubtably” the support for the provision “will be mixed,” said Pfister, who previously served on the Ad Board.Sundquist said the question deserves examination, but that he is unsure whether legislation to go before the Faculty on the issue would be produced over the summer. —Staff writer Eric P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a woman whose shoulders bear the burden of steering higher education’s grandest endowment through the most debilitating financial crisis in a half-century, Jane L. Mendillo cuts a decidedly unassuming figure.She speaks with measured confidence but betrays no ostentation. Her office, situated on the 16th floor of the Boston Federal Reserve Building, is adorned with little more than a few family photographs, three flat-panel monitors sitting atop her desk, and a comfortable view of Boston Harbor.But beneath her unobtrusive exterior, Mendillo, CEO of Harvard Management Company, harbors a wealth of investment knowledge. She commands the respect of colleagues at Harvard and elsewhere, who laud her unceasing composure during a sudden and unanticipated financial meltdown, her decisiveness under time constraints, and her focus on long-term investment success. “Truly, of all the people I’ve ever run across in the investment world, she was the most impressive,” says Andrew B. Evans, treasurer and vice president for finance at Wellesley College, where Mendillo managed the endowment for six years before she took over HMC’s executive position last summer. “Her ability to synthesize a huge collection of data and make it understandable to a lay audience, as well as a sophisticated audience, is remarkable.” While she has been at Harvard in this position for less than a year—she took up the post on July 1, right before markets began plummeting—Mendillo has no shortage of experience managing the University’s endowment. She spent 15 years at HMC working on nearly every asset class before embarking on her Wellesley hiatus, where she built the school’s investment office and re-engineered its portfolio. “Wellesley’s in a very good position thanks to Jane’s work,” says Deborah F. Kuenstner, Wellesley’s current chief investment officer. “She’s very good at thinking about the endowment in a long-term context—not just [in] this quarter or this year.”For much of her tenure at Harvard thus far, Mendillo has worked from dawn to dusk to not only salvage whatever returns remain in a dismal financial landscape, but also to take advantage of investment opportunities that may emerge as the storm calms in coming years.With only a month to go until the end of the fiscal year, Mendillo says she is quite certain that the projection of a 30 percent drop in the endowment, originally formulated in October, will hold. But despite the drop, she says she is confident that her team will find ways to use the crisis to Harvard’s advantage.“The time period in which we’re going to see improvement in the world economies, financial markets, and endowment performance is very much an unknown,” Mendillo says. “But we know that eventually things will improve, and the way we have the portfolio positioned—the set of strategies, the mix of investments—we know that we’ll benefit from that improvement.”LURED TO FINANCESeated in her office beside HMC’s expansive main trading floor, Mendillo says that her current post represents “the pinnacle of the career path” that she has pursued for the past 25 years. But her early interests were not always tied to the esoteric world of university investment management that she has come to love.Jane Lisa Mendillo was born in 1959 in New Britain, Conn. Her father served as an executive for a medical technology company while her mother stayed home to care for Mendillo and her two brothers and two sisters. She attended the local public school and was passionate about classical music—an avocation that she still pursues today—and participated in orchestra, band, choir, and school musicals.Mendillo pursued her undergraduate studies at Yale, where she dabbled in writing for the Yale Daily News and earned a degree in English literature. But during her junior summer, she interned at the Yale Investment Office—an experience that she credits with piquing her interest in finance. Ralph Earle III ’79, Mendillo’s husband whom she met in graduate school, says at one point she weighed the possibility of working toward a Ph.D. in English literature. But after being lured into the world of finance, Mendillo chose to pursue an MBA at the Yale School of Management and worked as a summer equities analyst on Wall Street, where she says she loved “delving into the details of earnings reports and economic cycles.” Though she spent a few years working in management consulting at Bain & Company in Boston, Mendillo decided she preferred the “excitement of investment management.” Eventually, she joined HMC’s internal equities management team, launching the career path she has followed ever since. Earle, who now does consulting work in “green” technology, says he is still impressed by his wife’s ambition and unique commitment to her career.“We started dating our second year of graduate school...and we said, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ And she said she wanted to be a CIO of a major university,” Earle recalls. “I didn’t even know such a job existed.”  While HMC has had five different CEOs since 2005, Mendillo says that she has no intention of leaving Harvard anytime soon. “This job will never get routine,” Mendillo says. “It’s very challenging, but it has a lot of inherent variety and intellectual interest.”A SHORT HIATUSIn her early years at HMC, Mendillo gained experience investing nearly all of the endowment’s major asset classes. She also assembled the University’s pioneering timberland portfolio, which helps hedge risk from traditional equity investments. When Mendillo took the helm at HMC last summer, real assets—like timber, agricultural land, and real estate—comprised roughly a quarter of the then-$37 billion endowment.Eventually, during these early years, she became vice president of external management, a post that had her overseeing investments in private equity, real estate, and emerging markets—a portfolio that grew to be worth $7 billion.After having gained extensive experience and knowledge of portfolio management during her first decade and a half at HMC, Mendillo departed in 2002 to take the top investment job at Wellesley, where she managed the school’s billion-dollar endowment. There, she implemented an investment strategy similar to the one used at Harvard, diversifying asset exposure and repositioning the portfolio for stronger long-term performance.But managing Wellesley’s assets likely never represented the full extent of Mendillo’s ambitions, and former Wellesley President Diana C. Walsh says she understood that Mendillo’s time was limited when they hired her. Nevertheless, she says the school is grateful for the work she did.The portfolio Mendillo created for Wellesley saw annualized returns of 13.5 percent during her first five years in charge. “I believe I was able to leave [Wellesley] in a much stronger position than what it was when I came in,” Mendillo says. “Wellesley gave me the top-down strategy background that I was looking for and it layered very well on the asset class specific experience I had at HMC.”THE BEGINNING OF THE STORMWhile her sojourn at Wellesley prepared her to take the helm of Harvard’s mammoth endowment, the company she returned to was dramatically different from the one she had left years earlier. In 2005, HMC’s legendary CEO Jack R. Meyer left the company with 30 other employees in tow to start his own hedge fund after enduring heated criticism for what some saw as excessive company compensation. Meyer, a 15-year veteran of HMC, had grown the endowment from $4.7 billion to $26 billion, achieving an annualized average return rate of 15.9 percent over his last decade there. He was succeeded by Mohamed A. El-Erian, an emerging markets bond expert and former economist for the International Monetary Fund, who rebuilt HMC’s internal infrastructure but stayed for only two years. By the time she arrived, Mendillo was dealing with not only a new staff but also small glimpses of the crumbling financial landscape that would engulf her first year.“When I started in July, I don’t think anyone could have foreseen the type of financial wind shear that lay ahead,” Mendillo says. “On July 3, the commodities market peaked after having been up 70 percent last year...and it went downward, pretty much in a straight line, to a negative 70 percent correction during the course of the fiscal year. That’s just one market.” But even before she returned to Harvard, Mendillo had been meeting regularly for months with interim HMC CEO Robert Kaplan, a professor at Harvard Business School and a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, both to make the transition to HMC seamless and to prepare the portfolio for volatile market conditions triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis. Kaplan says HMC invested in tail-risk insurance and aimed to deleverage the portfolio. While various media reports have called attention to Harvard’s attempts to sell large portions of its private equity portfolio at the height of the financial crisis, Kaplan notes that HMC had been preparing for such sales long before then, and that the outlook for the private equity market was already “decidedly cautious to negative” that summer.But despite these hedging strategies, financial markets continued to deteriorate through the summer and ultimately imploded that fall. On one mid-September Sunday evening, Mendillo went out to dinner with her husband to celebrate her fiftieth birthday, only to return home to multiple messages from her HMC team notifying her that they were formulating contingency plans for Lehman Brothers’ collapse—the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history and what many investors see as a seminal event in the financial crisis.Stephen Blyth, who had only been promoted to his post as head of internal management at HMC the week before, says that Oct. 2008 was the most volatile month in the entire history of equity markets. While the markets were already ominous prior to Lehman’s collapse, he says the event exacerbated the crisis by triggering massive risk replacement for the many derivative contracts held by Lehman, increasing potential systemic risk in the markets, and instilling a general lack of investor confidence. “We were well prepared, but we didn’t expect the Lehman failure, and obviously things were terribly difficult in the fall,” Kaplan says, noting that even a diversified portfolio cannot protect investors against simultaneous drops in nearly all asset classes. “The only precaution you could have had for that is not to be invested.”By Oct. 31, the endowment had already dropped by 22 percent. ‘OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE’Since then, Mendillo has made adjustments to both the portfolio allocation and the internal structure at HMC, although she and her colleagues all say that the long-term investment strategy and the internal-external hybrid structure utilized by the company will remain largely the same.“She’s had no hesitation in deciding that during certain moments this past year we should no longer do certain things that we would normally have been able to do, in terms of deploying capital,” says Andrew G. Wiltshire, head of external management at HMC. But he adds that “it’s not like we’re throwing out the old model and bringing in a new one.”For his part, Blyth says he is confident that his teams will outperform their market indices this fiscal year. According to Mendillo, the portfolio deleveraging process initiated prior to her arrival had been “accelerated” during the course of the financial crisis, leaving HMC with a positive cash situation today—in contrast to the company’s historic negative 5 percent cash reserve. But she says that HMC is now aggressively analyzing ways to carefully reinvest that cash to take advantage of opportunities for significant returns and diversification over the next few years. “The financial crisis has created the opportunity for change in a way that might not have existed if it hadn’t happened,” Mendillo says. And while HMC announced in February that it would lay off roughly 50 staffers—part of Mendillo’s desire to “rebalance the company to better suit the portfolio I want to have going forward”—it is now actively looking to hire some top-notch internal traders as well.A LEARNING EXPERIENCEWhile she has tackled the financial crisis opportunistically thus far, Mendillo says the past year has also been a learning experience. Maintaining liquidity will be an extremely important consideration in the near future, she says, compared to the past decade when markets boomed. And while she does not think risk management techniques failed investors, she does say that HMC will look to augment and explore new risk strategies. “If we don’t learn anything from this crisis, we really should be disappointed with ourselves,” she says.Although the challenge of managing the nation’s most prestigious endowment continues to demand long hours, Mendillo still aims to find time for relaxation, often cooking with her husband and cherishing whatever time she can find with her two teenage children, who currently attend boarding school.“I think one of her favorite things to do is to sit across from each other at the table with a nice meal, enjoying a glass of wine, and rehashing the events of the world’s day and our day,” says her husband, noting that they are particularly fond of Mediterranean cuisine. Mendillo says she continues to find the day-to-day work of portfolio management exciting and energizing, and that she never ceases to be motivated by the educational mission of the University she works for—a sentiment shared by her husband as well.“The single most valuable thing that we’ve been given is a great education...if you are a learned person, you have the opportunity and ability to contribute to society in a way that simply does not exist if you are not,” says her husband, explaining that Mendillo’s investment work broadens educational opportunities for a large array of people. “[Her job] is a great thing. She can really combine education with doing something that allows other people to be able to go to a place like Harvard or Yale.”—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.
