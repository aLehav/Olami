After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Texas,
Before leaving for Harvard, my family told me that I’d come to love you, that I would come to embrace my Texan side, that college would instill within me a distinct dignity in connection to my great hometown of Houston. I laughed, made some joke about going to New England to escape the closed-minded culture of the South, and swore I would never tote my “H-Town” upbringing with pride.
I maintained this distance for a while, putting you on the backburner of my identity. I detached myself from trips to Buc-ees, late nights at Whataburger, homecoming mums (apparently these aren’t a thing everywhere?), Tex-Mex restaurants on every corner, delicious barbecues in the sweltering summer heat, the classic and rite-of-passage road trips from Austin to San Antonio to Dallas to Houston, an obsession with HEB grocery stores, long weekends at Galveston, the incessant use of the word “y’all,” and the pledge of allegiance to the TEXAS flag ...
I really did try to bury my past for the lure of Boston’s dark academia, but the harder I tried, the more you seemed like home.
Not many people know your true colors. They see a fat, red state taking up the bottom portion of the electoral map and think they have you figured out. They think of cowboy boots and horses, oil rigs, and thick southern accents. They think Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) spoke for all of us when he abandoned his people in their time of need.
I see something different.
I think of Hurricane Harvey. I remember sitting with my family in front of the window, watching the brown floodwater snake up to our front door, creeping quietly upon us. We got lucky; others did not.
Water sat in houses for days. Rowboats and elevated trucks were the only ways to access some streets and neighborhoods. Wood floors were warped beyond repair, beyond recognition. Cars were destroyed and abandoned. Drywall transformed into mush. Sidewalks were rendered invisible from the trash piled on top. Water refused to recede, coloring the landscape in the muck of a swampland.
But then, your city responded, because, in Houston, tragedy is met with resounding cymbals of love.
I helped clean out a lot of houses, and one day, I was cleaning out the drywall of one of my friend’s houses when three men knocked on the door. We had never seen them before, but they explained how they had grown up in the neighborhood. After graduating from high school, they had joined the military and lived all across the nation, but when they heard what had happened in Houston, they came back. Without hesitation, they returned to their old neighborhood, going from house to house, helping anyone and everyone who needed it. That is my home. When you, Texas, are marred, your people respond with compassionate action.
Outsiders do not see this. They do not see your resiliency, your mobilization, your spirit amid tragedy. Houston may have flooded in water during the days of Hurricane Harvey, but the city overflowed with the relentless service of its citizens in the weeks after. Because that is how you, Texas, respond; you respond with unparalleled loyalty to brotherly and sisterly service to utter strangers.
You deal with another Harvey right now, though now the rainwater has returned as ice. Millions are without power, water, or heat, trapped in a winter storm you were not prepared to handle. My heart goes out to you. You, Texas, and your larger-than-life persona. And while it is easy for Harvard students to pass judgment upon you or send sympathy from afar, I know — as a member of your (let’s be honest) cultish community — you will get through this. Everything is bigger in Texas, and love for one another is no exception. Growing up within your weirdly-shaped state lines means we Texans are sharpened by blades of dogged determination and familial devotion, and it is because of this that I know you can weather this storm.
My family was right. Texas, you are my home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending nearly a year on the sidelines, Harvard College senior athletes have been invited back to the field. Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott announced in a Feb. 11 email that seniors whose seasons were disrupted by Covid may compete as Harvard graduate students during the 2021-2022 school year. The Ivy League presidents granted a temporary waiver to senior student athletes who lost a season of competition due to the pandemic. Though the National Collegiate Athletic Association initially granted one extra year of eligibility for competition to student athletes in response to the Covid-19 crisis, McDermott’s announcement marks the Ivy League’s departure from its traditions barring graduate students’ from competing.
But the motion, however well-intentioned, is too little too late.
Our senior athletes have, for the past year, been led to believe that they would not be eligible to compete for a fifth year at an Ivy League institution. They had to deal with the disappointment of seeing their athletic careers cut short, and — crucially — map alternative post-graduation plans beyond Harvard Yard, investing their time and energy into reformulating their future.
And while we believe the policy is an encouraging attempt at increasing seniors’ options, the Ivy League’s sudden concession is unlikely to give any of them room to change course.
The late timing of the League’s decision will do little to help Harvard’s senior student athletes. For one, a large number of our (extremely competitive) graduate school programs — including those at the Medical and Law School, as well as the Master’s program at the Kennedy School — have already closed this year’s admissions cycle, meaning that none of the recently athletics-eligible seniors will be able to submit a new application.
Of course, some go-getting student athletes might well find a program with a deadline still a few weeks away, slip in a slightly rushed personal essay, and perhaps even gain admission to one of Harvard’s grad schools: the best possible outcome that could stem from this announcement. But should they have to? Enrolling in graduate school is a life-altering, frequently debt-incurring decision; one that should be made carefully and calmly. Proposing that students select from a dwindling pool of open programs and commit to one within weeks is preposterous and antithetical to the sound, collected decision-making process that should adjudicate such major decisions.
We sympathize with those student athletes who found their varsity careers cut short by forces outside of their control, and are sure the Ivy League does too. But their gesture remains, at its core, symbolic in both nature and impact.
In that respect, the athletic eligibility debacle is emblematic of a broader emerging trend. Throughout the pandemic, University officials have done their best to appease disappointed students through grand but empty gestures. They have found themselves torn between public health imperatives beyond their control and an eagerness to support University affiliates; willing but seemingly incapable of providing effective help. Just like Harvard’s offer of free (and newly confirmed to be online) summer school classes — a reward for those who swallowed the bitter pill of an entire enrolled year off-campus, only redeemable if they elect to forgo most of Harvard’s other summer internship funding — there is a low chance that the beneficiaries of the Ivy League’s policy will be able to reap any of its supposed rewards. At best, such gestures are an example of tepid responsiveness against a complex backdrop; at worst, they come across as half-hearted and ill-planned, a tokenistic attempt to satisfy popular demand in an underwhelming, unpunctual fashion.
The University, much like its students, had limited options to combat the consequences of the pandemic, and we appreciate their efforts to help us grapple with its impact. Yet in some areas, including the athlete eligibility issue, the administration's response has proved slow and lackluster. Had this new policy been rolled out earlier, before deadlines passed and hearts were set, it might have proven more helpful, significantly so even. Instead, it’s just another empty promise representing Harvard’s struggle to keep up with our needs.

Correction: Feb. 22, 2021 
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard’s Athletics Department decided to allow seniors whose seasons were disrupted by Covid-19 to compete as graduate students at an Ivy League school during the 2021-2022 school year. In fact, the decision was made by the Ivy League presidents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council endorsed a statement calling on all Ivy League institutions to divest from fossil fuels at a Sunday meeting.
Sponsored by all eight Ivy League student body presidents, the statement calls on the universities to commit to “climate-conscious investments” and cease their investment in fossil fuel companies by 2025.
The statement said the Ivy League universities are among the “most powerful and privileged institutions in the world,” citing their collective endowment of $135 billion and their control of roughly 25 percent of all American university endowment funds.
Their collective endowments grant them both “social influence” and a “responsibility” to combat the climate crisis, according to the statement.
The UC passed legislation supporting this statement, following calls from students for the University to divest from fossil fuel companies.
“Calling for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels has been supported by a significant majority of the student body as recently as last the 2019 UC referenda process,” the legislation reads, referring to a vote the UC held in 2019 in which 69 percent of respondents supported divesting Harvard’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry by Earth Day 2020.
The act, primarily sponsored by President Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22, passed by a unanimous vote.
Harvard — along with most other Ivy League schools — has declined to divest from fossil fuels despite persistent student and faculty calls to do so, arguing that divestment could alienate potential partners in the fight against climate change. The Harvard Corporation directed the Harvard Management Company in April 2020 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions with the University's endowment by 2050.
Columbia announced in January that it would no longer invest in most oil and gas companies.
The UC also passed legislation to allocate funding for movie screenings and workshops by registered nonprofit Movies for Mental Health. These events will be hosted by Active Minds, an organization working to improve mental health resources on campus.
Sponsored by Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, UC Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee Chair and Cabot House Representative Brooke L. Livingston ’23, and Elm Yard Representative Anant P. Rajan ’24, the legislation was passed in response to a “deep lack of resources and community building” surrounding mental health.
The UC will allocate $1,000 for the events, which will include movies about the intersection of mental health and artistic expression as well as a panel with mental health experts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HKS Equity Coalition, a student group advocating for equity and justice at the Harvard Kennedy School, published an open letter in late January calling for several equity-related changes at the Kennedy School.
The letter rearticulates demands the Coalition made in previous years, including the implementation of a semester-long course covering racism and colonialism, as well as biannual anti-racism workshops, a public audit of the Kennedy School’s course curricula, and the annual hiring of four BIPOC faculty.
The Kennedy School's Black Student Union, Latinx Caucus, Asian American and Pacific Islander Caucus, Arab Caucus, Women’s Caucus, and the LGBTQ Caucus joined the HKS Equity Coalition in signing the letter, which garnered 329 signatures as of Wednesday.
In June 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the following nationwide racial reckoning, the Kennedy School mandated all incoming Master of Public Policy students take a two-week course called “Race and Racism in the Making of the United States as a Global Power.” While the open letter calls this a “start,” it demands a semester-long course be required of all master’s students.
In an interview with the Crimson on Wednesday, Equity Coalition coordinating team member Cassandra Duchan Saucedo said that “working with the administration is tough.”
“A lot of the responses that we get are basically saying that they’re already doing the work that we’re asking for,” Saucedo said. “But if you review the demands that we have, it’s pretty clear that that's just not the case.”
The open letter also states that BIPOC students are underrepresented at HKS, and that the school’s admissions process lacks transparency.
“Broadly speaking, Latinx students, Black students, and Indigenous students are completely underrepresented at the Kennedy School,” Saucedo said. “It’s disturbing to be at a school that really claims to be serving this future population, when it doesn’t even represent the current population of even the country, let alone in the world.”
The letter further states that BIPOC students face a “host of concerns and barriers” to accepting admission to HKS, and the letter calls for HKS to “shift the financial aid structure from merit-based to need-based.”
“There’s no need-based financial aid at the Kennedy School, it’s all quote-unquote ‘merit-based.’ The scholarships that are being given out are allegedly — at least what administration says — is that they’re given out on a dual need- and merit-based basis,” Saucedo said. “So I think the process is super opaque. But it’s also just visibly not need-based. I think they do a poor job of assessing need.”
Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in an email that the Kennedy School’s financial aid system already considers students’ levels of need.
“Our financial aid awarding process already factors in an individual’s level of need, and we continue to look for ways to expand need-based financial support,” Smith wrote. “While we would love to be able to meet the needs of all of our students, converting to an entirely need-based system would require far greater funding than we now have.”
Saucedo added that student organizers are dissatisfied with the school’s engagement with student groups.
“In general, the administration tends to approach student organizers in an antagonistic way and creates a kind of negative relationship,” she said. “It’s not just disheartening for student organizers, but it’s actually counterproductive for the school, and them resisting progress in the long term is not going to serve the school, especially because we’re moving into a future that is more diverse, hopefully, more equitable, and putting out students who aren’t prepared to deal with that is not going to serve them or their bottom line in the future.”
Kennedy School Dean Doug Elmendorf wrote in an email that HKS administrators regularly participate in discussions with students.
“We engage regularly in constructive discussions with students and others in the HKS community about ways to become even more effective at our mission,” Elmendorf wrote. “For example, building on discussions with students, we are making changes in how we incorporate need into the financial aid process (which we have told students we will discuss with them in the coming week), hiring students to help increase student diversity and inclusion at HKS, and strengthening how we incorporate student views in the faculty hiring process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 22, 2021 at 10:45 a.m.
Harvard professor and outspoken political activist Cornel R. West ’74 has threatened to leave Harvard — again — after he said the University dismissed his request to be considered for tenure.
In an interview with the Boston Globe published Thursday, West — a Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy at the Harvard Divinity School and in the Department of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts of Sciences — said he requested consideration for tenure based on a “positive five-year review.”
West said the University rejected his request, however, and instead offered him a 10-year contract for an endowed chair position and a corresponding pay raise.
West went on to claim that the University labeled his work as “too risky” and “too fraught” as justification for not reviewing his request for tenure.
“I’m too controversial,” West described his conversation with administrators to the Globe.
In a Friday tweet, West wrote he believes the University denied his request for tenure in part because of his outspoken criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.
“After being tenured at Yale, Harvard, Princeton & Union Theological Seminary, the recent Harvard denial of a tenure process strikes me as a political decision I reject,” West wrote. “Nothing stands in the way of my profound love for & solidarity with oppressed peoples wherever they are!!”
In 1993, the Divinity School and the African and African American Studies Department offered West tenure, and he eventually rose to the rank of University Professor, the Harvard’s highest faculty honor. In 2002, however, West elected to leave Harvard after a high-profile spat with then-University president Lawrence H. “Larry” Summers.
According to West, Summers questioned the merit of his scholarship, asked to monitor his research, and requested West’s course records to check for grade inflation. Following the conflict with Summers, West departed to teach at Princeton for 14 years.
In spring 2016, Divinity School faculty voted to invite West back. The University offered West a position as a professor of the “practice of public philosophy’”— a title bestowed upon individuals who have made outstanding contributions in their professional fields. In 2019, West also returned to teaching African and African American Studies 10: “Introduction to African American Studies” within FAS.
West’s public threat marks the latest controversy surrounding Harvard’s tenure review process.
The University received an onslaught of criticism in December 2019 for denying tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures Associate Professor Lorgia García Peña. Later that month, FAS Dean Claudine Gay launched a “comprehensive review” of tenure processes within the FAS following pressure from students and a letter signed by 107 faculty members. The review remains ongoing.
In a February interview with The Crimson, Gay said that the committee — led by Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser — was “on track” to provide a final report on Harvard’s tenure processes to all FAS affiliates later in the spring semester.
“[The committee]’s work is still underway, including lots of community outreach to solicit feedback on every aspect of our process,” she said.
Peña responded to West’s predicament on Twitter Thursday.
“So Harvard doesn’t think @CornelWest deserves tenure,” she wrote. “I’m feeling flattered to be in such great company. Sending you love, brother.”
West did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Responding to a request for comment, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referenced a statement he provided the Globe in which he offered insight into the offer Harvard made West.
Swain wrote that a committee of faculty at the Divinity School and FAS successfully recommended the University reappoint West to his current posts. The committee did not have authority to conduct a review for tenure, per Swain.
Swain added that West was also recently appointed to the Victor S. Thomas Professorship of Public Philosophy at the Divinity School, an endowed chair position.
West told the Globe he feels “disrespected” by the University and will not “try to negotiate respect.”
He added he would like to return to Princeton or Union Theological Seminary.
“If I cannot be put up for tenure, then it is clear they don’t think I’m worthy of tenure,” West said. “And I will go.”
CORRECTION: February 22, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair was leading the FAS committee reviewing tenure procedures. In fact, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser is leading the committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Cambridge homeless shelters facing operational challenges due to Covid-19, the First Church in Cambridge raised more than $30,000 for two projects supporting unhoused residents during its annual fundraising gala Saturday night.
The virtual gala — which featured Government professor Michael J. Sandel as a guest speaker — raised a total of $33,500 through ticket sales to more than 200 people as well as donations. The money will fund the church’s 14-bed men’s shelter, in operation since 1987. Since the start of the pandemic, the location shifted from an overnight to a 24/7 shelter. The money raised will also support the Church's Friday Café — a program that offers meals and other resources to the homeless.
During the gala, Divinity School professor and Interim Minister of Memorial Church Stephanie A. Paulsell interviewed Sandel about the themes of his book published in September 2020, “The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good?” Along with her questions, Paulsell brought up questions from guests of the shelter and Friday Café.
Sandel discussed “the meritocratic ideal” that is “deeply human-centric,” in which  the ultimate goal is individual success, such as obtaining a university degree or being “able to compete and win the global economy.”
“It does carry a certain insult,” Sandel said. “Because for a great many people in our society, if you haven’t gotten a college degree and if you’re struggling in the new economy, the implication is your failure is your fault.”
Sandel argued that more “public spaces” are needed to challenge this meritocracy, citing the ministry as an example of “sites and occasions” that rebuff the idea that money is tied to personal worth.
Minister of Street Outreach Reverend Kate Layzer — who helped establish the Friday Café in 2014 — said in an interview that these programs serve as an “opportunity” for not only providing help to those in need, but “helping people to be helpful.”
“That’s kind of what Dr. Sandel was talking about,” Layzer said. “About how we don’t have so many opportunities now to work together and work in community for the common good.”
Harvard Book Store, one of the event sponsors, announced that it would make a contribution to First Church Homeless Ministries for every copy of Sandel’s book sold.
In an interview, Paulsell, who has been a member of the church for almost 20 years, praised Layzer and shelter director Jim Stewart for their work on the church homeless programs. Stewart also received the gala’s “2021 Uncommon Commitment Award.”
“We both hope to bring as much attention as possible to the incredible ministries that Jim Stewart and Kate Layzer and the congregation at First Church do together,” Paulsell said, “both with the shelter for homeless men and the Friday Café, which has been a really important place for people to get warm and get something to eat and have conversations and have a safe place to be during the day.”
Unlike past fundraising events, the gala took place virtually and was streamed on the church’s YouTube channel.
Susan Reynolds, a First Church member who has worked in the Friday Café program for four years, said the organization decided to bring Sandel in as a guest speaker following a book talk that several members of the church attended.
“Everybody kind of laughed like ‘we can’t have Michael Sandel! He is the A-list. We’re not necessarily A-list material,’” Reynolds said. “Then we decided, ‘what the heck, we might as well just give it a try.’”
“We worked very hard on writing an introductory letter and to present ourselves correctly, and lo and behold, he came back and said ‘yes’ right away,” she added.
Sandel wrote in an email that he considered the invitation to support the First Church Homeless Ministries “a privilege.”
“The Ministries not only provide food and shelter for those in need; they also remind us that we at Harvard share a neighborhood with unhoused neighbors,” Sandel wrote. “The responsibility to share our good fortune is not a burden but a gift, because it calls us to a sense of community that enriches us all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As online education persists during the ongoing pandemic, Harvard Extension School students have renewed calls on the University to alter the school’s degree names to “accurately reflect students’ programs of study,” according to an open letter penned by the Harvard Extension Student Association.
Currently, all Extension School degrees label the field of study as “in Extension Studies” instead of referencing the student’s specific field. Some Extension School students said they believe this component of their degrees does not accurately reflect their programs of study.
“The degree name is just a misrepresentation of the field of study,” said Sylvia A. Black, director of events for the Harvard Extension Student Association. “We’ve earned our degrees and our degrees should reflect the area of study.”
Veronica E. Bruno, the Bachelor of Liberal Arts liaison for the Harvard Extension Student Association, said the current degree name has the possibility to stymie graduates when they apply for jobs.
“From what I understand there’s real prejudice around the degree,” Bruno said. “You’re working a job as well and you’re taking Extension Studies at night, and then you go to improve your prospects at a job and you’re told, ‘Well, is your degree really real?’”
“We’re proud Extension School students. We proudly want to display that name on our resumes, on our LinkedIn profiles,” Bruno said. “We just don’t want when we walk into an HR office for them to say, ‘Well, you know, is it really a degree?’”
“That’s our nightmare,” he added.
Natela V. Gluzinskaia, director of student affairs of Harvard Extension Student Association, said she believes the degree name is “disrespectful.”
“I do feel like maybe the entire school needs to be, in fact, the School of Continuing Education because this is who we are,” Gluzinskaia said. “We are continuing our education, and that is what should be on the diploma as well, but ‘in Extension Studies’ — I feel it’s so disrespectful.”
“Nobody’s looking for a Bachelor’s in Extension Studies. This is why it’s just so disrespectful,” she added.
Before his retirement, former Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Huntington D. Lambert expressed his support for the removal of “in Extension Studies” in 2019, stating that the degree names are “academically wrong” and that he had spoken to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, about the issue.
In 2016, a group of Extension School students held a protest on the steps of University Hall against the degree name.
Jacob J. Khan, president of the Harvard Extension Student Association, said he considers the label “in Extension Studies” to be an “equity issue.”
“Any kind of student initiative that says, ‘let’s remove “Extension Studies,”’ we would have to support it 100 percent,” he said. “I think it’s an equity issue — it’s dehumanizing. I think that the fact that it says Extension Studies kind of puts a label on people.”
“A student is a student — we shouldn’t label them because it’s wrong, it’s unethical,” he added.
Ryan G. Kramer, founder of the HES Campaign for VERITAS — an initiative dedicated to bringing about a revision in the degree nomenclature — said there is a disparity in treatment between Extension School students and students from Harvard’s 11 other schools.
“They’re in general treated as second-class students or alumni, and it’s just not appropriate,” Kramer said. “It’s basically, without saying it, it’s like a Harvard Lite.”
“Now someone may say, ‘Well, that sounds like an insecurity issue.’ It’s really not,” he added. “Nothing at Harvard is easy — there’s nothing Lite at Harvard. You need to earn your way into Harvard Extension, and you need to earn your way through it and out of it.”
In October 2020, Kramer penned a letter to Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow and members of the Board of Overseers to request their consideration of removing the “in Extension Studies” label. According to Kramer, University administrators did not reply to his letter, but he did receive a response from Dean of Continuing Education Nancy Coleman.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Dean Coleman said she is “aware” of student requests for a degree name change, but maintains that the degree name does not stymie graduates’ success.
“We are aware of some students’ desire to change the name of the degree. We are equally aware of a large number of students and alumni who are proud of their degrees from Harvard Extension School and who have commented that the degree name has had no bearing on their success,” the statement read. “We will continue to explore the question of degree naming in appropriate governance venues.”
Bruno said she is “optimistic” the University will consider changing the degree naming.
“I’m very optimistic. I think that there’s no better time than right now,” said Bruno. “Not everyone can go to Harvard College, not everyone can go to the Harvard Business School, but Harvard Extension School is really a beacon of education.”
“It is one of the most powerful institutions for spreading real education around the world,” she added. “We think that’s something that Harvard University should be proud of and not try to hide away.”

We are in the middle of a panorama. A Panera Bread. A panopticon. I haven’t left my room for more than a total of 20 minutes in the past 96 hours. I have seen another person’s full face twice in person in the month of February. For these reasons, it seems rude that professors continue to have basic expectations of me. Also, I’m tired.
“Do the Readings”
I enrolled in your course because I was genuinely interested in the material. Mostly. For some of y’all, I did just sign up for your course because it met a requirement, though I promise I’m still kind of interested! But asking me to read? In this economy? When I have nothing else to do but watch the downfall of our democracy and make TikToks? RUDE. I tried. I really did. I have had no willpower to read a single word for a single class this entire semester. Not even when all my classes were shiny and new, and certainly not now.
“Have Thoughts”
This one’s obviously rude. I’ve been no thoughts, head empty for most of my time on Earth, but any final brain cells that were clinging to life were swept away with my tears and all my Olympia storage belongings into a black hole somewhere around mid-March 2020.
“Show Up to Class”
The only reason I can force myself to do any reading is because of the severe anxiety I get when I’m in class and haven’t even opened, let alone read, any of the PDFs, and the professor’s getting ready to cold-call people. (Which is its own ‘Dude, That’s Rude,’ but I digress.) The only thing that drives me to get food, a basic human need, is the hope for some kind of human interaction and the desire not to get kicked out of student housing because I haven’t left my room to turn in my latest Covid test. That’s where I’m at. And you want me to sit somewhere other than my bed, find your Zoom link, turn my camera on, and listen? Or even *gasp* take notes?
“Turn in Assignments”
Time does not exist right now. I barely have any conception of when the day turns to night and then back to day again, especially with the constant cloud cover and the blinding blue light that haunts my waking hours and my dreams. Even if I wanted to write an essay (which I never do), I literally do not have the brain capacity to remember a due date or to remember to write down a due date.
“Try to Care”

Professors, you’ve put the bar on the floor, and that’s still too high.
