After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this column, one thing I have mentioned, but not emphasized enough, is the value of having conversations about mental health. So, when I suddenly remembered that I needed to write the last piece for my column while over at my friend’s house on Sunday evening, I decided to ask the guys I was with a few questions about mental health — feeling like it was an appropriate way to wrap things up. And I learned more than a few things as they answered my questions (perhaps, most notably, how a few drinks could turn them into “surfer-bros”).
While Covid-19 has been a major annoyance and a detriment to the mental health of myself and the rest of the student population, it hasn’t been much of an issue for these mates of mine. Although we’ve had the luxury of living in New Zealand, where there have been fewer lockdowns and overall cases than many other countries, through our conversation, I’ve come to believe that regardless of the public health situation, these guys would’ve been equally unaffected.
Their secret is simple: surfing.
In my first column piece, I talked about the value of having a hobby during Covid. While surfing is exactly that, it also represents what I warned against. When I described what kind of hobby you should look for, I said the goal shouldn’t be to improve yourself or to achieve something, or else it isn’t any different from half the things we do as university students. But, to an extent, surfing is about both of these things. You improve your skill and fitness for the goal of — what one of my friends called, rather poetically, for someone whose eyelids were drooping — a “brief moment of tranquility.”
As long as they’re able to surf, I feel like these guys could weather almost anything, despite surfing breaking the rules I set for a good hobby to preserve your mental health. It doesn’t shock me that I wasn’t completely right — but still, what did I miss? As we talked more, I began to understand it had nothing to do with surfing.
When I asked my mates if they’d ever experienced a lot of “mental pain” or discomfort, one explained his approach, sharing the fairly uncontroversial opinion that focusing on mental pain is not helpful. But something I had not thought about before, was his reason for why: “You’re in it already.”
This was a strange reason to me. My attitude toward mental pain in my life has always been something I need to escape from, that I need to climb out of before it gets worse. I’d never considered resigning to mental discomfort as a way of moving on, only as a way of making things worse.
“If something has the potential to mentally hurt me, I don't shy away from it. Same when I’m surfing big waves. Preemptively, I notice them and I see them coming at me, but if I’m sitting there, nothing else is going through my mind, I’m just going to go up to it and surf it like any other wave. I won’t be scared because I’ll just be experiencing it,” he said.
The interesting part of this statement was not the method he uses to deal with mental pain, as I think this can differ for everyone. Rather, it was the conceptualization of mental pain implied in him comparing mental pain — something we attempt to actively avoid — to the sensation of riding a big wave, something that surfers like himself crave. I think many people, including myself, stand to benefit from seeing mental pain in a similar way.
These guys will surf for hours hoping to catch one of those big waves, and when one approaches, they have every reason to be scared. Likewise, you can’t avoid mental pain in your life. But then, the wave arrives, and the anticipation goes away. Now you’re in it. Sure, you can abandon the board and jump into the water — or, you could just treat it as another experience, another moment of the many that compose our lives.
We already do this every time we watch a sad movie, fully aware that it will have this effect but watching it anyway. We know that these negative emotions are part of the experience, and part of what makes the movie good — why should our attitude towards life be any different?
Maybe this wouldn’t be true if negative emotions were completely avoidable. But they aren’t. Accepting their inevitability and trying to experience them, — keeping in mind that the wave will pass and that negative emotions are part of what makes life what it is — is a better approach than avoiding and denying mental pain to no avail.
Without this conversation with my mates, I’m not sure I would have arrived at the conclusion that we can treat negative emotions the same way you would a sad movie or big wave. When I put it like that it seems absurd. Nonetheless, what I think this shows is that open conversations about mental health are a worthwhile endeavor: I learned more about those guys, as well as myself, through my ideas about mental health being challenged.
When the freshmen from the Class of 2024 arrive on campus, I hope that Zoom habits won’t endure. I hope communicating with each other will not seem as arbitrary as it has over a year in which we’ve learned each other’s names and faces without learning who anyone is. I hope in the place of these habits, we create a student culture where conversations like this are the norm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Content warning: Sexual harassment, racism
To preface, I do not plan to reveal the name of the organization involved in this incident, nor will I reveal the identities of any individuals. The purpose of this piece is not to call out or cancel anyone. I think it is important for people to be able to learn from their mistakes without being defined by them. However, I also think that it is important that we, as Harvard students, become aware of certain parts of campus culture that can be very harmful. As many Harvard clubs release statements in support of #StopAsianHate and anti-racism, they must also reconsider their traditions and confront their potentially racist, sexist, or otherwise harmful histories.
On March 30, 2019, I was sitting in the Lowell House Junior Common Room. It was a late Saturday night. That spring, I was spearheading “The East Side,” an original musical that I had co-written with two friends. The show was about a Chinese restaurant and was to be the inaugural production of Harvard’s Asian Student Arts Project, a club that we had just founded. By producing the show, we hoped to celebrate Asian American identity and represent our stories on stage in a way that we had not yet seen.
At 1:01 a.m., my phone started going off. Within a minute, I had received 11 text messages from 11 different unknown numbers. Among them were:
Two minutes later, I received the following text from a friend who was a freshman at the time —
“I’m so sorry, I’m getting … hazed rn, please don’t get freaked out! But if it’s good by you, they want to know which is the best via you responding to the best one with an eggplant emoji”
To put it lightly, I was confused. He was being hazed by an organization that I wasn’t a part of? What did that have to do with me? And why were the messages so … racial??
So what did I do? I laughed it off. And I went along with what my friend had asked.
The next day, I ran into him and asked about the previous night. Apparently, he was playing a game during initiation, and as part of an old tradition, he had to reveal one person’s phone number to whom everyone would send a sext. He chose mine.
Somehow, I think I found it funny at the time. I was flattered, even — my friend saw me as someone with a sense of humor and a close enough friend to be involved in his group’s antics. I think a lot of us are trained to just laugh things off — it’s easier than getting offended. No one wants to be that girl that can’t take a joke. After all, some people in that organization were Asian. Some were women. If they laughed at this, why couldn’t I?
I didn’t stop to consider the implications of the messages. I let it go.
Two years later, when I happened to encounter that friend again, I was reminded of the text messages. That night, sitting with a few close friends, I pulled out my phone and scrolled back to 2019. I began to read them out loud. By the time I was halfway through the messages, I was horrified. My friends were disgusted. I kept going. The final message left me with a sick feeling in my stomach.
How could this have happened? I tried to picture the night from the point of view of someone in the organization, to explain these racialized, vulgar sexual text messages, sent by a crowd of people to someone they barely knew. I told myself again that it was just a joke. A game. They were probably drunk. They probably didn’t even remember what they had sent to me.
I supposed that the only thing they knew about me was my involvement in “The East Side,” and perhaps the only thing they knew about “The East Side” was that it was about Chinese food. That had to be what inspired the content of the messages. But a grosser, scarier suspicion kept pushing into the forefront of my mind: The only thing they knew about me was that I was an Asian woman. And that was what inspired the content of the messages.
Most of all, I felt guilty and anxious. Over the next few days, questions raced through my mind: How could I have ever thought these were funny? What had I done to make others think this was okay? Should I do something about this now? Even as I write this, I’m second-guessing myself. Am I overreacting? Why dig this up after two years? It was a different time.
But it just feels impossible not to connect incidents like this with the 3,800 anti-Asian racist incidents of the past year or the Atlanta spa shooting. It is often the casual, seemingly non-violent acts of racism and sexism that permit and pave the way for the worst. Racism doesn’t exist only in the extreme, violent stories we hear on the news. It doesn’t come exclusively from extreme, violent people. Sometimes, it comes from your peers. Your friends.
Last weekend, I called my friend and asked him, again, to explain the game to me. This time, he added a crucial detail — the rules of the game were to choose not only a person to send messages, but also a topic around which the sexts would center. He had chosen “The East Side.” “Thank god,” I thought, “I was right. They weren’t just trying to be blatantly racist. It was just a joke.”
But still, something didn’t sit right. I explained that, to me, with zero context, it just seemed like I had received a series of racially motivated sexual messages due to my involvement with “The East Side.” I forwarded him the screenshots. He completely understood and apologized, assuring me that he would do what he could to ensure this tradition would be terminated.
Sure, it was just a joke. But some jokes aren’t funny. Sometimes we say things, without intending to be racist, that are absolutely racist. At least 12 people were in that room. No one stopped the messages from being sent.
Prior to writing this op-ed, I spoke with the new leadership of the organization, who informed me that they do not condone or participate in hazing. We had an open, honest conversation, and they informed me that they have discontinued the tradition. They apologized and contacted the individuals involved in the incident. I was made aware that they are now holding meetings with their alumni and current students to take actionable steps to reexamine and improve the culture of their organization.
And so, for a time, I considered leaving this unpublished. After all, the organization was making changes. But this piece isn’t about me or the particular organization involved. It’s about bringing to light the institutional racism and sexism within our community that has allowed incidents like this to run unchecked. Through conversations with friends, I discovered that I’m not alone in facing this type of harassment at Harvard. So instead of pointing fingers, let’s focus our energies on rooting out the normalized conventions that perpetuate racial and sexual violence within and outside the Harvard community.
This incident challenged me to think back and critically evaluate the jokes or traditions in which I have participated, and I invite you to do the same. Seemingly harmless jokes can hurt more than you’d think. Whether within student groups or in our day-to-day interactions, let’s all be a little more careful and a little more compassionate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics’s biannual gauging of youth opinions and political psyches — now a 21-year-old tradition — again took place this past March. This year, the IOP Harvard Public Opinion Project’s national poll of 18 to 29 year olds surveyed 2,513 young Americans about their views on topics ranging from the Biden administration, to mental health, to the future of the Republican Party.
Our main take-aways? The flashbulb issues that students at Harvard have been rallying around, including immigration and affirmative action, coincide neatly with the tide of opinions growing more popular among young people across the nation. More than 100 days into the Biden presidency — and, insanely, more than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic — there have been double-digit expansions in support for “progressive” ideas among young people (or what the survey labels as such, anyway). And, if you sift through the shift in America’s ideological landscape, a swell of hope jumps out.
This leap in hope is evident: Since fall 2017, there has been a 25 point increase in the percent of young Americans who feel hopeful about the country’s future. The expansion of feelings of hope amidst a year of unimaginable tragedy, and countless setbacks for young people, is a reason to be hopeful in and of itself. But the hope doesn’t stop there.
The cause for all this newfound hope might be found in the implementation of actual policies which aim to advance, or have already made dents in, many of the political ends young people are after. From pushing out stimulus checks — which are projected to cut child poverty by 5 million and were made available to far more college students than their predecessor — to an expedited roll-out of Covid-19 vaccinations, it’s no wonder that young people are now becoming more hopeful. After a grueling, death-filled, year, they’ve been given reason to anticipate something better is coming.
As a group of young people ourselves (shocking, we know), we’re not immune to the trends the survey crystalized. We find many encouraging. In the past five years, there has been a significant increase in youth support for higher government spending to reduce poverty. This is in tune with our Board’s own chorus of support for Cambridge spending being utilized to alleviate suffering among the most vulnerable members of our community, as well as broader student and community advocacy urging our local government act to help those in need. On environmental issues, the poll also demonstrated a substantial surge in those who agree that the government should sacrifice economic growth to prevent climate change — a sentiment that picks at the same threads as our own Board’s, as well as legions of our peers’, support for fossil fuel divestment efforts. When the new vanguard takes over, maybe — hopefully — transformation on both fronts will occur.
On more intimate questions of equity and tolerance, there was an animating increase in the number of young people who see benefits in recent immigration and affirmative action. Such strides embody a growing fervor that has been ignited, rather than dulled, over a tenuous four years in politics. In these statistics, we also see our own peers — from graduate students who have petitioned in response to travel bans; to those protesting on the streets of Cambridge in opposition to other anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric coming from Washington; to those, like our own Board, who have expressed utter disdain for the efforts of anti-affirmative action groups like Students for Fair Admissions.
While many of the percentages are far lower than we would like them to be (two out of three young people still being anti-affirmative action is a big yikes), their upward movement is indicative of desperately needed progress.
It also seems that Harvard’s low percentage of conservative faculty members doesn’t just reflect paradigms unique to Harvard or its hiring committees; it's in line with the nation's turning tide. More people are just increasingly buying into policies we label as liberal. So (location-willing), even when that Harvard bubble bursts, the political waters we wade in might not be much different.
Amid this optimistic spring, there remains a need to distinguish between the relief we have felt due to the end of the autocracy edging of the past four years, and the hope which motivates us to work towards a better future. We cannot take the current improvements as reasons for complacency. Progress should remind us that change is achievable if we continue to fight for it. If young people’s hope translates into us disengaging, storm clouds lie ahead.
And even as the IOP survey highlights positive strides young people have made, it also reveals myriad nationwide problems that still need reckoning. Mental health is one of them. In part five of the IOP survey, it was revealed that 51 percent of young Americans have experienced feelings of hopelessness and depression in recent weeks, and 28 percent of young Americans have felt that they were better off dead, or have considered harming themselves at some point. These numbers are terrifying. The poll also underscores that young people of color are more likely to experience extreme hopelessness and depression — with around one out of three Black and Hispanic youth reporting such feelings. This intersection of race and hopelessness connects more broadly to the distinction between hope and relief — that while hope is the bedrock of any work to build a better future (why would you try to build what you believe is impossible?) — many are still looking for something to hope for.
Still, in an era in which there are so many reasons not to have hope, it remains wonderful that our generational peers are holding on to the hope that things can and will be better. And, though anything can happen, we hope they will be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said the University waited until doses were readily accessible across the country before joining other Boston-area colleges in mandating Covid-19 vaccinations for students before returning to campus in the fall in a Thursday interview.
Harvard announced the vaccine mandate on Wednesday, two weeks after all people 16 years and older became eligible for the coronavirus vaccine in every state. Massachusetts was one of the last six states to open adult eligibility by the April 19 deadline set by President Joe Biden.
Though other colleges issued vaccine requirements “fairly early,” Nguyen noted that college students were not yet eligible to receive the vaccine in every state by then.
“We wanted to make sure that eligibility was universal across the country,” he said. “So that when we made the announcement, we didn’t bring about a tremendous amount of anxiety for people who, at that time, didn’t have any eligibility for vaccination.”
Nguyen noted Harvard’s announcement follows a recommendation issued last week by the American College Health Association stating all students living on university campuses should receive the vaccine before the fall semester.
Nguyen also said the University’s decision to mandate vaccinations against the coronavirus resembles other school protocols regarding vaccinations.
“In the end we decided that we were going to treat this like other vaccine requirements that we have already instituted for many, many years at the University,” Nguyen said. “That made it a lot simpler for us to be able to move forward.”
HUHS plans to ramp up public education efforts to reduce possible vaccine hesitancy on campus, which Nguyen said he believes has been minimal.
“Our impression is that the Harvard University community is actually very supportive of the idea of getting vaccinated,” he said.
The University is aware, however, that some students are holding out on getting vaccinated, according to Nguyen. Students may be reluctant to take the coronavirus vaccine, he said, because they “haven’t seen enough information to make them comfortable.”
While Harvard has not unveiled residential guidelines for students living on campus this summer, Nguyen said he expects life on campus will be “somewhere in between where we have been and where we hope to go.”
“We’re very, very optimistic about what we’ll be able to do this summer,” Nguyen said. “Plus, with the summertime weather, people will be able to spend time outdoors without masks, physically distanced from each other.”
Students are no longer required to wear face coverings when socially distanced and outdoors. Cambridge relaxed its outdoor mask mandate on April 30 in line with a new executive order signed by Mass. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79.
The College announced Wednesday it will continue to regularly test undergraduates for Covid-19 during the fall semester. Nguyen said he anticipates the rate of testing on campus “will be driven by the results of the tests that do come back.”
“If we continue to see infections in our communities, we want to make sure that we catch that early,” he said. “We have found over the course of this pandemic that we have really been successful in identifying people early and preventing those infections from turning into uncontrolled outbreaks.”
In the case of an outbreak on campus next fall, Nguyen said he feels “very confident” that Harvard is prepared to increase testing and support students who test positive.
Even though Harvard will house a larger undergraduate population on campus next semester, a fully vaccinated student body will likely reduce strain on isolation resources, Nguyen said, as vaccinated students are “less likely to have to stay completely sequestered.”
“We’ve always planned for more than actually happens,” he said. “There’s always contingency plans for if things get worse than we had hoped, but right now everything is indicating that the number of total infections that will happen is likely to be lower this fall as a result of everyone being vaccinated.”
Though the University is preparing for possible complications, Nguyen said he is optimistic for a successful return to campus in the fall.
“With the combination of identifying those few infections that we anticipate might happen and also having the vast majority of people — almost all people — vaccinated, then I think we’ll have a very successful fall term,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bill in the Massachusetts State Legislature spearheaded by a Harvard alum would require all students enrolled in the state’s schools and colleges — including Harvard — to complete fire safety training.
The bill — which would mandate a fire safety curriculum and proficiency assessment to gauge student mastery of the material — was introduced in February by State Representative Marjorie C. Decker and State Senator Sal N. DiDomenico in their respective chambers, both Democrats who represent Harvard’s district. As of March 29, the bill has been referred to the committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security for further consideration.
The legislation originated in advocacy by Lauren K. Gibbs ’77, who lost her daughter Margalit “Mara” Gibbs, a student at Reed College in Portland, Ore., in an off-campus fire in February 2017. The fire started in an apartment Mara Gibbs shared with two roommates and after being awakened by the heat and fumes, she was able to dial 911 but was overwhelmed by the smoke and lost consciousness before completing the call. Her roommates managed to escape the fire, but she died two days later from smoke inhalation and her injuries.
Lauren Gibbs said her daughter died in the fire because she had not received enough fire safety training to know that she should have escaped from the apartment and then dialed 911 from a safe location. Since then, Gibbs has campaigned for fire safety education in schools, including colleges and universities, including in her native Massachusetts with the bill currently before the Legislature.
“It’s not that I got involved with the bill,” Gibbs said. “The bill happened because my daughter died. My daughter died because she had no fire safety information.”
Harvard’s Environmental Health and Safety department currently offers fire safety training for residential staff members so they can implement further training and education for students, according to Michael Conner, director of communications for Harvard University Campus Services.
“As part of this program, each year, EH&S trains residential life and building management staff to implement fire safety training for students, faculty, and staff,” Conner wrote. “The training provides basic fire safety and prevention tips as well as insight into what to do in the event of an emergency, pre-emergency planning, evacuation maps, knowledge of emergency evacuation routes, and emergency procedures.”
In addition to the training and accessible fire safety information on Harvard’s Campus Services website, fire drills also promote proper fire safety practices for those living on campus, according to Connor.
Aside from these measures, however, Harvard does not currently require fire safety training or education for students. If the bill is passed, Harvard would have to design a mandatory fire safety curriculum and a proficiency examination to comply with the new provisions.
Gibbs said she hopes the bill will be strengthened to require fire safety training annually, to ensure that all students, including those who have transferred from other states and countries, are proficient in the appropriate fire safety procedures.
Gibbs added she remains committed to pursuing fire safety education legislation not only in Massachusetts, but throughout the United States.
“I want to hit all 50 states,” she said.
Cambridge Fire Department Acting Chief Gerard E. “Gerry” Mahoney, who has worked in firefighting for nearly four decades, said he supports the proposed legislation and the safety measures it would require.
“I wholeheartedly endorse it, I think it’s a great idea,” Mahoney said. “I’ve been in this business for 38 years. We’ve had our share of incidents at the campuses of all three universities in the city — Harvard, MIT, and Lesley — some unfortunately with some tragic consequences.”
Mahoney said he envisions the fire safety curriculum would be administered in the form of online training videos, with a quiz afterward to test students’ retention of the information. He also cautioned against complacency resulting from decreased rates of fires and fire-related accidents.
“We don’t have the amount of fires we used to have, thankfully, and unfortunately, that has built in a lot of complacency into peoples’ lives,” he said. “Famous last words are always ‘What could happen?’ ‘What could go wrong?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a Wednesday interview Harvard has been “putting processes in place” to improve its procedures for vetting University leadership candidates after an external review found a Government professor was repeatedly promoted despite a record of sexual harassment.
The report, released in February, detailed how a “permissive culture” toward gender-based harassment at Harvard allowed former Government Professor Jorge I. Domínguez to sexually harass women over three decades at the University, while being promoted to several high-profile posts. Domínguez was barred from Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences campus and stripped of his emeritus status in 2019 following his retirement.
The report attributed Domíngeuz’s ability to escape accountability for decades in part to the University’s decentralized structure. It recommended the creation of a centralized personnel record database and standardized vetting procedures.
“We have moved forward with a number of process improvements to ensure that we don’t make that mistake again,” Bacow said Wednesday.
Bacow told The Crimson in February that Harvard would move to create a system for centralized access to personnel records to prevent past disclosures of harassment from being missed during leadership promotion processes.
He said Wednesday that the school has “put together processes in the short-term to address these issues” when considering candidates for its recent appointments, but has not yet formalized its central personnel database.
“People have been vetted across multiple schools and multiple administrative units to ensure that we have not overlooked something that may have been recorded in one part of the University that was not necessarily recorded in another,” he said.
Bacow explained the current vetting process requires University leaders to manually examine records in various offices across Harvard, but he suggested a future centralized system would be more “automated.” Still, he expressed confidence in the procedural improvements enacted since the external report.
“We are in a position now so that, the same issue, were it to arise now, might be a little bit cumbersome, but we would still avoid the unfortunate outcome that occurred previously,” he said.
The report also recommended the University improve gender diversity among its faculty. A report issued earlier this year found that 28 percent of tenured faculty at Harvard are women.
“We’ve made substantial progress on gender diversity over the last 10, 15 years,” Bacow said. “A very high proportion of the appointments that we’ve made since 2007 have moved us towards gender balance.”
Since 2011, the percentage of tenured faculty who are women has increased by 6 percent. The percentage of non-tenured female faculty has increased from 37 percent to 42 percent over the same time period. Women remain most underrepresented in engineering and physical science, where only 14 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of tenured faculty members are female.
“Faculty turns over slowly, so if you just look at the overall composition of the faculty, it appears to be changing slower than if you look at the new appointments that we’ve made over the course of the last 15 or 20 years,” Bacow said.
“We certainly have far more women in senior academic positions I think probably than we’ve had in the history of the University,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year without Ivy League athletics due to the coronavirus pandemic, the league is expected to resume a full competition schedule in fall 2021, the Ivy League Council of Presidents announced in a joint statement Tuesday.
The presidents convened last week to finalize their shared aim of returning to regular competition for the upcoming fall season, “barring any extraordinary circumstance” surrounding the pandemic, according to an emailed statement Harvard’s Athletics Director Erin McDermott sent to student athletes on Tuesday.
The presidents cited marked improvements in infection case numbers nationally as well as vaccination rollouts as drivers of their decision.
“[G]iven the current steady decline of Covid-19 infections in this country, and the broad availability and uptake of vaccinations, we are optimistic that our campuses will be back to something close to normal by this fall, including in-person learning with students in residence,” the presidents said in their statement. “And this includes our expectation for the resumption of regular competitive schedules for Ivy League athletics across all sports beginning in fall 2021.
Harvard announced in March it plans to invite all undergraduates back to campus to live and attend in-person classes for the fall semester. University President Lawrence S. Bacow also wrote to affiliates on Wednesday that Harvard will require all undergraduates living on campus in the fall to get inoculated against the coronavirus.
Harvard men’s soccer player Maximillian J. “Max” Goeggel ’24-’25 said he is excited to compete for Harvard in the fall. Goeggel added that time away from the field was valuable.
“I wouldn’t say I had burnout, but I definitely lost a little bit of the passion for [soccer], and taking a break from it and getting some time to do some other things allowed me to find the hunger to get back into it,” Goeggel said.
Goeggel, who worked at an architecture firm during a gap year, said he anticipates leaving his job shortly to rededicate himself to training.
“I need to focus on getting physically fit after not playing really organized soccer for a year,” he said.
Football player Brock A. Locnikar ’24 said he is excited to embrace the intensity of Division I football after spending his first year at Harvard participating in socially-distanced practices.
“As a linebacker, I really love the intensity and physicality of football,” he said. “But last year being a socially-distant practice, it was very hard for me to play to my strengths.”
Though she is excited to take the field for the fall season, field hockey player Siena C. Horton ’24-’25, who is from England, wrote in an email she has concerns about being able to enter the country, which include securing a visa.
“I think it will take me actually standing on campus for me to realise that there is no longer anything to worry about,” she wrote.
Following Harvard’s announcement that it will hold an in-person fall semester, international freshmen reacted with similar excitement and concerns.
In their joint statement, the Ivy League presidents anticipated a return to “spirited athletics competition and to the Ivy League rivalries that make our conference so special.”
Locnikar said he welcomes the competition.
“The Crimson are going to take the Ivy League next year,” Locnikar said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Instead of heading to Boylston Hall on Friday nights like in past years, Harvard’s Southern Baptist Chaplain Daniel S. Cho ’96 and other members of the Asian Baptist Student Koinonia now assemble online for Bible studies, games, and small group reflections.
Before the pandemic struck, Harvard’s religious groups would physically gather to worship, study scripture, perform service work, and enjoy food in each other’s company. Though the University’s chaplains say they are pleased by how well their groups have maintained continuity through the pandemic, they agree virtual programming is no match for in-person gatherings.
“Being together in person, in physical proximity to each other, was such a central part of our identity and practice, and I think that's not just true for faith communities, but it's true for the college as a whole,” Cho said.
Cho said the Harvard ABSK is working to combat the isolation of online life. With the help of alumni, the group has shipped care packages to students across the globe. They have also taken advantage of the Zoom environment to connect with other ABSK organizations around the country and overseas through a virtual global retreat.
Patrick J. Fiorillo, Harvard’s Catholic Chaplain for undergraduates, said members of the Catholic Student Association surprised him with their motivation and zeal to stay involved. The CSA began several new initiatives such as online Sunday homilies, podcasts, and a YouTube channel featuring different Catholic students.
Fiorillo said he also created his own podcast where he interviews Catholics at Harvard. Meanwhile, George S. Salzmann — the Catholic Chaplain for graduate students — created a weekly YouTube series about history and faith in Harvard and Cambridge.
“I don't want to brush over the reality that this sort of Zoom setup and social distancing is, in the end, not a positive. I want to make that clear,” Fiorillo said. “But great benefits have come from it, and from a perspective of faith, we believe that God can use all things for an ultimate good.”
“However, I can’t wait for the return of the sort of normal human interaction that’s superior in every aspect,” he added.
Harvard Quaker Chaplain John Bach said that Quaker students worked hard in ensuring that the Zoom is “not a barrier, but a pathway.”
“This may be an opportunity for us to re-examine and, as the Quakers say, to ‘move towards the light’ to a greater sense of inclusivity and diversity,” Bach said.
Bach also noted more students have joined the group’s Sunday morning worship, during which participants reflect in silence and then commune with one another. Quakers at Harvard are planning to reintroduce small in-person meetings that abide by social distancing guidelines, per Bach.
Baha’i Chaplain Donna Hakimian said the Harvard Baha’i Association has used the online environment to collaborate with members of the faith beyond campus. With a group from Northeastern University, they celebrated the Baha’i holiday Ayyam-i-Ha in a virtual gathering with musical performances, holy scripture readings, and group reflection.
“I have just been so inspired, so heartened by the response to this pandemic and the disruption of the lives of students and how they’ve really tried their best and they’ve used these constructive resilience tools,” Hakimian said.
Khalil Abdul-Rashid, Harvard’s Muslim chaplain, said Muslim students have focused on communal support and grief counseling through large Zoom meetings. At the end of each meeting, students would share “spiritual multivitamins” — lessons or reminders of something positive and uplifting.
Though the Muslim Chaplaincy and the Harvard Islamic Association are working towards planning a trip to the Mecca late in the fall, Abdul-Rashid said the wait for a reunion is difficult.
“The general sentiment has been one of longing,” he said. “Longing for a sense of the return to a real sense of community.”
Orthodox Christian Chaplain Vassilos Bebis said that virtual programming cannot match the profundity or impact of in-person engagement.
Bebis recalled a time when he could hold masses for more than 60 undergraduate students of Eastern Orthodox Christian faith in a physical church, and also invite them to join him in volunteering at local soup kitchens.
“It's not the same,” Bebis said. “We don't have the same feeling, and many students are tired, because they use Zoom, again and again and again.”

To some students at Harvard Law School, the Harvard Law Record is a paper coaster on a classroom desk. But to William “Bill” H. Barlow II, the publication represents “what the Harvard Law Review should be.”
“It is actually read, it is actually discussed, and it actually changes conversation,” Barlow said, reflecting on his time at the Law School.
Harvard Law School is famed for its premier student-run journals, manifold in both scope and speciality. From the esteemed Harvard Law Review to the Harvard Human Rights Journal, these publications offer law students the opportunity to sharpen their editorial skills while strengthening their candidacy for prestigious post-grad careers.
The Harvard Law Record — an independent, student-run, nonpartisan newspaper — is a different sort of publication. Previous and present leadership of the Record said its unique legacy lies in its ability to forgo the tedious pleasantries of traditional legal scholarship and foster open, often controversial conversations that are at the forefront of campus debate.
Founded in 1946, the Record is the country’s longest-running law school-affiliated newspaper and has featured the writings of legal figures including former President Barack Obama, former presidential candidate Ralph Nader, and former Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
Throughout its history, the Record witnessed momentous events in both American and Harvard Law School history, and continues to undergo various degrees of popularity and relevance on campus. Former editors and contributors argued the Record must endure to ensure that free, honest discourse remains a reality at the Law School.
On Wednesday July 17, 1946, the Harvard Law Record published its first paper. One of the inaugural volume’s editorials described the Record as “primarily a journal of opinion.”
“It will strive to become a forum for the Law School, its topics ranging the gamut of public interests — sociological, governmental, economic, philosophical, political, moral, international, constitutional and so on, as well as discourses more directly legal in the old cramped sense of the world,” the editorial read.
The Record’s emphasis on expanding both the scope and depth of discourse at the Law School continued past its introductory volumes.
Nader, a former editor-in-chief of the Record, published a piece in May 1956 which detailed the plight of Native Americans and their battle with systemic injustice at the hands of American law and society.
In his article, Nader argued that both historical and fictional accounts of Native Americans “instilled in the American public a misinformed and highly inaccurate view” of the peoples. He also discussed the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which Nader said “finally halted” the “impending destruction of tribal cultures” but was still implemented imperfectly.
Nader said he believed the Record to be an important platform to discuss such pertinent subjects. But as its free copies piled up in Harkness Hall, he said many of his peers did not regard the Record with the same importance.
“Nobody would ever comment that they ever read it,” Nader said. “They would say to me, ‘What are you wasting your time on this for? Is that going to get you through the bar exam, is that going to get you a job?’”
Robert Z. Mahari, current president and former editor-in-chief of the Record, said what makes the newspaper “special” is its mission to provide a “neutral place for discussion” at the Law School.
“There are things that I think are missing from the classroom, discussions we don’t have because they might not be appropriate in the classroom or we might worry about voicing certain opinions,” Mahari said.
Throughout its history, the Record has seen an ebb and flow of campus popularity and relevance.
“There were periods when it was very strong and periods when it was less strong — I think right now is a bit of a waning period,” Mahari said. He is actively looking for a student to assume leadership of the publication.
“There needs to be leadership to really spearhead it, someone who cares deeply about it and has the time to dedicate to it,” he said.
Michael E. Shammas, former editor-in-chief of the Record, said he believes there are two primary functions of the newspaper: publishing stories that Harvard Law School “would not talk about” and fostering a platform for open discourse amongst students and faculty, similar to a “Socratic dialectic.”
Shammas said he thinks good journalism “makes people uncomfortable,” adding students could submit responses to previously published articles with which they wished to engage.
“Let’s say someone submitted a piece that another person disagreed with, I would publish a response,” Shammas said. “That started a dynamic which I thought was pretty valuable.”
But not all students were interested in going on the record with their opinions, he said.
“There’s a lot of Harvard Law students who, they’re already anticipating their future Senate confirmation hearing,” Shammas said. “The Harvard Law Record does not tend to attract people who worry a lot about what they say.”
Katherine J. “Kate” Thoreson, a previous editor-in-chief of the Record, said many “uniquely qualified” law students were “really reticent” to contribute to the Record or “publically express any views.”
“It’s sort of a limiting principle,” she said. “If you’re going to work at a big law firm, sometimes you don’t necessarily want to be loud about certain things, so people tend to be really cautious.”
Thoreson said she repeatedly asked peers whose views were not represented in the paper to “take a chance on it.”
“The answer is usually negative, but sometimes you get a yes, and that yes drives a lot of discussion,” she said. “I don’t think you can drive tons of discussion if you’re not even willing to publish people with whom you disagree.”
James W. “Jim” An, another former editor-in-chief of the Record, said that in its early years, the newspaper frequently spearheaded live debates about current events.
“If you look at the issues from the ’50s, they were hosting straight up debates on topical political issues,” An said. “If anything, there should be more of that. I think it’s not happening as much as it was.”
An said that a key explanation for this may be that today’s students are more cautious about what they say to prevent jeopardizing their future legal careers.
“I think people are more reluctant to speak their minds on important issues because they feel that it might affect their careers, and I think that’s accurate,” An said. “Maybe I offend this partner and it reduces my chance of making partner by one percent — I think that’s the calculation people are doing in their head.”
Barlow argued the strength of the Record was its ability to allow students to write freely rather than constantly be concerned about factual accuracy, citations, and political correctness — which he believes may not facilitate “good scholarship,” but rather “good discussion.”
“That’s the failing of the Harvard Law Review, and that’s the success of the Harvard Law Record,” Barlow said. “That willingness to say overly broad statements and exaggerations for the purpose of conveying something that’s actually meaningful and discussed, whereas the Law Review context everything must be cited and everything must be footnoted.”
Bruce E. Fein, a contributor to the Record, said the publication is “unique” because it is “unreluctant to challenge” the opinions and authority of the establishment. Rather than focus on a specific, narrowly defined implementation of the law, Fein argued that the Record invites open-minded, big picture discourse concerning the purpose of the legal system.
“The Harvard Law Record attempts to at least present these views by being more oriented, saying, ‘What is the goal, why do we even have a system of law here anyway?’” he said.
In addition to asking the big questions, Fein said the Record performs a “human service” to students by presenting a counterweight to the dominant culture of the Law School.
“It presents an alternative to the old career path — you go on the Law Review, write an article, get a clerkship, and then you go back and either become president like Obama or join a big law firm and get paid a staggering amount of money,” Fein said. “It adds a diversity that you won’t get in the other kinds of publications.”
It wasn’t until Barlow overcame his concern about high academic marks that he began to take the Record seriously and became a contributor.
“I stopped really caring about getting grades in school and started having a lot of fun and that’s when I started writing for the Record and immediately dropped anything to do with writing for any journal,” Barlow said.
Barlow argued the Record helped open the Law School’s Overton window by encouraging students to be in conversation with diverse, at times polarizing, opinions of peers and faculty.
“For those who read it, especially when there began to be more controversial opinions on both sides of the aisle, it was a place where students felt free to listen to opinions that they were often afraid to voice in public and even in private,” Barlow said.
Without platforms of open discourse like the Record, Barlow said, students run the risk of entering spaces of homogeneous thought and shying away from speaking with individuals who hold disparate viewpoints.
“The inherent danger is the danger of the echo chamber,” Barlow said. “By opening up discourse on things that are outside of the accepted norms of your particular society, you can have conversations about topics without making enemies.”
“That’s the value it provides,” Barlow added. “It allows for those conversations to take place.”

During the first surge of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, David F. M. Brown — chief of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital – moved out of his home for more than three months in fear of transmitting the virus to his family.
“At that time, my daughter — who was in our Covid pod — was pregnant, and I was convinced that I was going to get infected, and I didn’t want to infect her or my wife,” Brown said.
Though moving out “seemed like the right thing to do,” Brown said his isolation came with personal challenges.
“I didn’t move back in until sometime in June — that was kind of a tough time for me to stay upbeat,” Brown said. “I remember that weekend moving out of the house and feeling kind of down and then there was that 15 weeks of isolation.”
Similar to Brown, second-year infectious disease fellow at MGH Kathryn A. “Katy” Bowman found herself facing the unprecedented threat and onslaught of work last spring — all without the support of her family or time off to rest.
Bowman said she did not see her family in Texas for a year following the first wave. In fact, she gave up her one week of vacation last year to volunteer in the Covid-19 intensive care unit.
“I felt like even if I took time while in Boston, I couldn’t leave here, I’m not from here, I couldn’t see my family — I would just be wondering what I could be doing here instead,” she said.
More than 10 medical professionals who have been on the front lines of the Covid-19 battle at two Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals — MGH and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center — told The Crimson in interviews that they had faced similar impacts on their emotional well-being over the past 14 months while they put their lives on the line to save others.
In response, the hospitals have implemented programs to support their staff, drawing on the expertise of Harvard’s own faculty specializing in mental health. The frontline workers also said they relied heavily on one another through the darkest periods of the pandemic.
Even with vaccinations on the rise and cases falling across the nation, several of the employees said these mental health impacts would persist.
“This problem doesn’t end when the surge ends,” said Medical School professor Kerri Palamara McGrath, who leads the Center for Physician Well-being at MGH. “This is a problem that is going to be with us for a while.”
According to a national survey conducted by Mental Health America from June to September of 2020, 93 percent of health care workers reported experiencing stress, 86 percent reported anxiety, and 76 percent reported exhaustion and burnout.
McGrath said these wider trends are consistent with the pandemic’s toll on MGH hospital staff, including increased rates of depression and anxiety, loneliness, and burnout.
HMS psychiatry professor Christopher M. Palmer said health care workers have faced overwhelming stress that has led to these mental health problems.
“Their providers have been overwhelmed, crying out for help, begging for help, saying, ‘We can’t take this. We can’t do this. I can’t sleep, I’m having ruminations, I don’t know how to deal with all of the guilt. I don’t know how to deal with all of the grief. People are dying,’” he said.
The first phase of the pandemic, in particular, came with great uncertainty for health care workers, according to BIDMC Senior Director of Social Work Barbara S. Lee.
“The first surge was really challenging because none of us knew much about Covid,” Lee said. “We were operating in emergency mode without really understanding the illness and what we were up against.”
John Herman, associate chief of MGH’s Department of Psychiatry, similarly noted that the surge of Covid cases at “unprecedented levels” early in the pandemic, coupled with the novelty of the virus, placed an immense burden on clinicians.
“We didn’t know how, at first, to take care of these patients, and so the clinicians were feeling desperate to deliver the very best care,” Herman said. “We were learning.”
‘A Huge Roller Coaster Ride’ 
Another major stressor for health care workers has been the fear of bringing the virus home and infecting family members, according to MGH intensive care unit nurse Brittany Sheehan, who characterized the pandemic’s mental health impacts as a “huge roller coaster ride.”
“I cared for critically ill patients for years, but never at the threat of bringing something home that could kill my parents,” Sheehan said.
Health care workers also took on the additional responsibility of facilitating interactions between patients and family members when social distancing restrictions limited hospital visitations, according to Pamela N. Peck, clinical director of BIDMC’s Department of Psychiatry. She noted that this task put an “unusual strain” on the hospital staff.
Brown said he distinctly remembered one interaction with a patient who was very sick and required intubation.
“We helped him FaceTime with his wife before we intubated him and put him on a respirator because we knew there was a pretty good chance that he was not going to survive to talk to her again,” Brown said.
“That experience happened again and again and again, especially during the first surge,” he added.
Despite more than a year of trying to cope with the tremendous emotional distress, medical professionals have largely not been able to take time off. When the first surge of the pandemic hit, non-Covid-related surgeries and care had to be postponed, creating a “backlog of care,” according to MGH Chief of Emergency Preparedness Paul D. Biddinger.
MGH Associate Chief Nurse Suzanne Algeri compared the current situation for health care workers with soldiers coming home from war.
“When you think about soldiers going off to war and then returning, they’re given some time off for a very good reason, they need that time to take that pause to restore their mental health and well-being,” she said. “In similar ways, staff here have been through a really tough year with this pandemic, and there’s been an enormous amount of stress on them.”
An unending cycle of intense, toiling work since last year has resulted in “cumulative fatigue,” according to Bowman.
“There’s a cumulative grind to being constantly at work, constantly thinking about work, constantly wondering how to get on top of upcoming literature and know as much as you possibly can because it’s all new,” she said.
Narsis Attar, an internal medicine resident at MGH, said these pressures have manifested in different ways for each frontline worker.
“I can say that I really don’t think I had experienced burnout until this,” she said.
In response to the pandemic’s impact on clinicians’ mental health, Harvard-affiliated hospitals have not only bolstered established programs, but also created new wellness resources for their workers.
During the pandemic’s first wave, existing groups at MGH promoting staff wellness — including the Employee Assistance Program, which offers free, confidential counseling — came together to form a group called the Wellness Collaborative in order to help address the challenges staff were facing.
Not a single person showed up to the first listening session that the Collaborative scheduled, according to McGrath, the Center for Physician Well-being director.
“What we realized was people didn’t want extra — people had no time,” she said. “So we had to start meeting people where they already were.”
Throughout the summer and early fall of 2020, employees who were part of the Collaborative instead conducted 130 to 150 listening rounds within Patient Care Services where they sat in on departmental meetings and gathered employee feedback on how to best implement mental health resources, according to Algeri.
One initiative that developed out of those listening rounds was a going-home checklist — a list of questions for staff asking how their day went, what things they felt good about, what challenges they had to overcome, and whether they or their colleagues needed any support.
“People were waking up stressed out about the day ahead, going into their day bringing those stressors with them,” McGrath said. “And then bringing that stress home with them, and then having terrible experiences at home, and then going to bed even more stressed than when they woke up.”
“This intervention was one way to break that cycle,” she noted.
The Wellness Collaborative expanded the hospital’s existing peer support network, most notably by launching a Buddy Program for staff to check in with one another.
Some volunteers at MGH facilitated by Elyse R. Park — a professor of psychiatry at the Medical School — formed a peer support hotline from March to July 2020 that offered real-time assistance to MGH frontline workers in need of mental health support.
In addition to numerous peer-support programs, Park also created resiliency training programs for employees to develop coping skills.
According to Park, those that participated saw a decrease in depression and anxiety, as well as an improvement in stress management and resilience.
“People said the most helpful thing was just actually being in a group with other clinicians, and being able to have a space to talk,” she said.
MGB has also begun to offer virtual yoga, spin, cycling, meditation, and cooking classes, among other wellness resources. To help staff navigate the plethora of offerings, the Collaborative curated a resource guide, an internal website listing resources by need, and a weekly newsletter, according to McGrath.
Beyond established wellness initiatives, frontline workers said they relied most heavily on their colleagues, with whom they could have open conversations about their mental health.
“Everyone’s been really aware of the impact of the pandemic on each individual,” Attar added. “People checking in on each other and and really being thoughtful and watching out for one another — I think that really has been incredible.”
Bowman added that the most resilience-building aspect of the pandemic has been how “close knit” everyone in and beyond her division have become.
“There’s been a surfacing of humanity within our healthcare system that’s between health care providers that’s been really refreshing and I think really wonderful,” Bowman said.
“I hope that that continues,” she added.
Many of the clinicians said they believe their hospitals should continue providing easily accessible wellness resources for health care workers.
“Leadership saying that, ‘How are you doing?’ — I think that’s for peers to ask each other,” Herman said. “But for leadership to say, ‘What can we do for you?’ — those are critically different questions.”
Attar added that simply making resources available is “not enough.”
“It has to be advertised, it has to be accessible,” she said. “Just because they exist, that doesn’t mean people are able to use it.”
Offering mental health services “in the moment” is essential for clinicians who often are limited in their time to access more external resources, according to Sheehan, the ICU nurse.
“Everyone doesn’t always have the time to kind of outsource when you’re not at work,” Sheehan said. “I think that’s been the most helpful thing and would continue to be really helpful for services to come in to us at work and say, ‘We’re here.’”
Attar also said she believes institutions should aid in preventing clinicians from overworking, or providing care to others “at the cost of caring for themselves.”
“I think just reinforcing that being able to take care of yourself and taking time away from caring for others is actually important,” Attar said. “In a practical sense, being able to give employees that specific devoted, dedicated time to be able to actually step back and take care of their mental health, take care of their physical health even.”
Burnout among physicians and nurses has been an issue within the healthcare system long before the pandemic, according to McGrath.
With the increased awareness regarding the importance of maintaining mental health and well-being, though, McGrath said hospitals should now consider how to not just correct the negative impacts of the pandemic, but also think about ways to improve the system that existed before.
Despite the vaccine rollout and optimism around the state of the pandemic, Biddinger said he believes health care workers will need considerable time to recover from its impacts.
“The psychological wounds of the pandemic will likely linger for a while,” Biddinger said. “I think the people should be aware of what the wounds and needs are of medical providers going forward, as they will need time to process and heal themselves.”

It’s the end of the semester. You’ve watched the past few months flyby (pun intended) and it somehow feels as though you’ve done absolutely nothing with your time aside from testing the limits of your Zoom lecture attention span or analyzing the optimal level of procrastination. Luckily, flyby is here to add a little thrill to your life with 7 ways to spice up the last few weeks of the semester.
1. Turn in a final project 5 or more days before it’s due
Let’s face it, procrastination is inevitable…take this as your calling to change things up. Have you ever turned in an assignment (much less a final) not one minute, but five days before it’s due? We didn’t think so. Perhaps it’s finally your time to shine — not only will you get it over with and avoid that feeling of an impending deadline looming over you, but this may quite literally become the greatest flex of your college career.
2. Take a full day off. Like actually take the day off. 
You say you haven’t gotten any work done today, but is that really true? Even if you haven’t physically cracked anything out, there’s a 99 percent chance you either feel guilty about not having done enough, or couldn’t get the prospect of work out of your head. Try taking a full day off and give yourself a chance to recharge after what’s been one of the most challenging years for the world. Whether this means spending a day exploring nature, practicing retail therapy, or even watching TikTok for 6 hours straight (let’s just pretend you don’t do this on the regular for the sake of this article) and forget about your responsibilities to recenter yourself so you can finish off the semester strong!
3. Actually keep up with your sleep schedule
This might be the most chaotic of them all. Imagine having a consistent and reasonable sleep schedule where you’re not falling asleep at the crack of dawn and waking up midway through lecture (or even worse, a final exam). Try keeping up with a ~reasonable~ sleep schedule and you might even find it boosts your productivity and alertness. At least give it a shot. We know it’s a bit of a hard task, but you wanted cHaOtiC sPiCe in your life right??
4. Channel your alter ego
Swap your wardrobe to its complete opposite for one week. Do what you gotta do: thrift, steal clothes from your parents, siblings, and friends, or even dig out your clothes living in the back of your garage from four years ago before you underwent a ~transformative experience~. Chaos. Activated.
5. Stay unmuted throughout an entire Zoom meeting
Seeking maximal chaos? Look no further. Staying unmuted for an entire Zoom meeting may quite well be one of the riskiest, most anarchic activities one may take on. A hyperactive dog who barks non stop may be the least of your worries. You never know just how much you need something until it’s gone.
6. Speak exclusively with a foreign accent for the next few weeks
Now, there are two options for this one. Option 1: you speak with an accent you’ve already mastered to the point that it sounds natural, and people are incredibly thrown off by your sudden change in identity. Option 2: you speak exclusively with a very poorly executed accent that makes people wish they had the option to mute you, both digitally and irl. Take your pick and let us know how it goes!
7. Go Skydiving
Because. Why. Not.
Anywho, we hope you’re inspired by at least a few of these and are able to make the last few weeks of this semester just a bit (or a lot) more exciting. Remember to take it easy and give yourself a break, especially after this past year. Good luck with finals everyone! <3
