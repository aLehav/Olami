Few Houses can sustain a 40-50 e-mail discussion without the posters lapsing into boredom (or the readers into self-immolation), but Adamsians can talk like few others can.  While this week's flamewar over the House t-shirt probably won't go down in the annals of great threads along with the wrap-sandwich debate of early '09, it was marked by one of the "looser" e-mails we've seen go out to 200+ strangers. Some might say this intrepid writer was "having too good a time," others might flatly call it inebriation:
The rest of the e-mail ruminated on whether highlighting Adams' aristocratic past was appropriate for the shirt...but you got the gist.  A later poster applauded the drunken typing on display, but we take issue with the underuse of the "shift" key.  Also, hasn't anyone turned on Mail Goggles yet?
