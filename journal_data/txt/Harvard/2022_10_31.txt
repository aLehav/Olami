After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Apple picking, trips to Salem, chill air, and freshmen fiending for parties — fall really is in full swing at Harvard.
Now that the luster of the first few weeks has worn off and the panic and exhaustion of midterms season has set in, there is another familiar experience that has reemerged: the plight of the chronically late individual.
Marked by a hasty scramble out the door (following a similarly hasty scramble out of bed), anxious foot-tapping on the shuttle, repeated watch-checking, and the occasional sprint across campus, the chronically late individual never quite seems to have enough time.
I, too, have been known to wake up for 9 a.m. classes at 8:50 or catch the 10:30 shuttle for my 10:30 class. (You will never catch me running, though — I’ve decided to adopt the long-stride-better-late-than-never mentality). It’s never that much of a problem; I usually stroll in and awkwardly find a seat about five minutes late — by all means on time. At least it used to be.
Along with so many once-touted and beloved institutional traditions, Harvard Time is gone.
Boasting its own page on Urban Dictionary, Harvard Time was once defined as “Seven minutes later than real time. A comment on how classes at Harvard start 7 minutes after they are listed (example: at 10:07 instead of at 10:00) to allow time for students who must cross the campus from one class to another.”
The beginning of the end of Harvard Time was marked by an institutional scheduling change to 75-minute class blocks which allotted 15 minutes of passing time between all classes, obviating the need for the deeply ingrained seven-minute delay that had come to define every scheduled event on campus.
While professors tried to follow the new schedule immediately, it seems the change was less sudden in the hearts and minds of Harvard students. The real death of the grace period can probably be traced to the same thing that changed many aspects of normalcy for good: the Covid-19 pandemic. Rolling out of bed and logging into a Zoom call made punctuality a lot easier. In the 2-D classroom, there was hardly a need to wait for people to trickle in. And, with the help of the institutional memory gaps that erased many already-fading campus traditions, this new, Harvard-time-less world has stuck.
Professors and TFs alike tend to start right on the dot and students usually arrive moments before — most students, anyway. There remains the question of the chronically late. Sure, the problem faced by these select tardy people may easily be remedied by rushing out the door 10 minutes sooner. And perhaps this should be a lesson in punctuality. But I’d prefer to think of it as one piece of Harvard that most of us never got to experience.
Maybe the fact that so many of us didn’t have the opportunity to be on time seven minutes late is precisely what makes it sound so appealing. Harvard is stressful enough without the unbridled anxiety that accompanies sleeping through an alarm. Beyond the missed shuttle or the awkward silence as you shuffle into a seat, we tend to immediately panic over the smallest things. In this light, a bit of good-natured flexibility in what so often feels like a rigid system is just the reprieve we need. And, after all, we have the rest of our lives to be punctual.
Harvard culture fosters an unattainable need to be perfect all of the time. It’s exhausting. It’s restrictive. And, paradoxically, it keeps us from improving by constructing and reifying environments that are inhospitable to the growth that comes from making mistakes. The removal of Harvard Time makes this manifest — what little institutional forgiveness we’ve had for small mishaps continue to fall away.
Reinstating Harvard Time, however, is not the answer. In fact, it would be contrary to my whole point: that beyond any one idiosyncratic tradition, sometimes we just need to be a little less strict. We can and should resist the inexorable pull to systematize everything. It is time to consciously give ourselves the grace of 7 minutes before letting the gravity of a situation set in.
Be kind to yourself and others. Know that very few things are worth breaking into a sprint for. Take your time. And remember: A grace period is a wonderful remedy to more than the needs of the chronically late individual — even if some of us should also consider waking up just a little earlier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Debates over the admissions policies of Harvard and other elite universities are all the rage, particularly as the Supreme Court is hearing arguments today in a case that will likely spell the doom of race-conscious affirmative action. Many at Harvard have reacted with opprobrium to this case’s hearing and to the potential decision, arguing that Harvard’s current admissions regime is necessary to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.
But the hot, ongoing debates over the substance of Harvard’s admissions policies — whether race or socioeconomic status should be taken into account, whether or not legacy applicants deserve a leg up — are not truly questions of inclusion. Advocates for affirmative action are not attempting to make Harvard broadly inclusionary — a tall order for an institution that is, by its very nature, highly exclusive, most recently accepting fewer than one in 25 applicants. Instead, they wish to alter the distribution of an extraordinarily scarce good: a spot at Harvard. Those on both sides of the debate take this scarcity as a given, moving not to accept more applicants, but instead to engineer precisely which lucky few may access a Harvard education with all its lifelong benefits.
We don’t have to take scarcity as a given. Instead of locking horns over which group of students deserves preference in admissions, we can give up the zero-sum game entirely. We can let more brilliant young people walk through Harvard’s hallowed gates. We can make Harvard abundant.
It’s time to expand Harvard’s undergraduate enrollment.
The unchallengeable assumption that Harvard only has so many spots to hand out limits what Harvard can achieve as an institution. Harvard’s problem with equity and inclusion in the admissions process is not that Harvard admits the wrong set of students — too privileged, too wealthy, too white — but that it admits too few.
Harvard promises from the very beginning a “transformative college experience.” And, at least in the economic sense, it succeeds beyond its wildest dreams. Underprivileged students who attend top universities like Harvard experience extraordinary upward mobility, reaching nearly the same level of income as their wealthy peers. One admissions decision — a “yes” or “no” from Harvard or another top school on the admissions portal screen — might make a large difference in lifetime earnings for a significant group of hopeful teens.
However, it is impossible for Harvard to be this engine of opportunity, mobility, equity, and inclusivity when its admissions numbers have remained at similar levels for the past 20 years, even as application numbers have surged. Expanding enrollment will spread the fruits of a Harvard education far and wide, rather than confining it to a worthy elect.
Still, this proposal would come with some necessary sacrifices. It would require us to let go of the American tendency to see exclusivity as the stamp of prestige and scarcity as the stamp of value, defining our “elite” universities as necessarily small and highly selective. There is no reason they must be: Canada’s top-ranked institution of higher education, the University of Toronto, enrolls over 70,000 undergraduates. Harvard enrolls about 7,000, one-tenth of that number.
There is no tradeoff between the quantity of students and the quality of education, especially with no shortage of potential faculty to hire. A larger community is not a lesser community. It is a more abundant community. What we might lose in the allure of prestige-by-exclusivity is made up for tenfold by the fundamental character of the people and the institution. As Harvard grapples with the scourge of elitism — from competitive club comp processes to a social scene dominated by exclusive final clubs — perhaps a paradigm shift in what creates a valuable college experience is necessary. We can start to define Harvard’s excellence by true excellence of outcome, not simply the artificial excellence implied by exclusivity.
As long as we assume that the aggregate amount of opportunity Harvard can provide is limited to its current level of enrollment, Harvard will never be the force for equity that it tells us it wants to be — and that it easily can become. Open the gates. There is so much more we can do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re reading this, you’re probably very different from the average American student. Let me tell you just how unique you are. First, remember that most Americans don’t pursue post-secondary education: Two-thirds of adults in this country don’t have a college degree. Of those who do, the overwhelming majority do not attend a selective university: Less than one percent of current college students attend an Ivy League school.
Although we all implicitly recognize Harvard is different from most schools, this fundamental truth often gets lost in our discussions of higher education. This piece will flatter your ego by telling how unique you are, but also put you in your place by arguing our school matters less than you may think. If we want to increase educational opportunity, we need to focus less on Harvard.
People talk a lot about Harvard. And I mean a ton. For example, Google analytics show that mentions of Harvard far outstrip mentions of community colleges in books. Although it’s always nice to see Yale in second place, the level of attention on elite institutions is simply astounding.
This trend is also reflected at the New York Times, where coverage of Harvard doubles that of community colleges, according to analysis published by Vox media. Prominent media and political outlets are staffed by people who went to elite colleges – more than 40 percent of New York Times writers and editors did — so, it’s understandable that coverage skews towards these schools.
In focusing too much on elite schools, we both ignore some problems and overemphasize others.
Most colleges deal with different problems than Harvard. Take college dropouts. Completion rates are on the mind of most community colleges since the majority of their students don’t graduate in six years. You wouldn’t know this is a big deal by looking at Harvard which consistently has near 100 percent completion rates.
College admissions is an even better example. What should Harvard do about legacy admissions? Should admission officers consider SAT scores? These are fundamentally debates about how to allocate a surplus of applicants for a very small number of spots, but the more common problem in higher education is having too few applicants. Indeed, many smaller colleges face bankruptcy because enrollment rates are down.
Excessive focus on selective institutions distracts from more important policy questions. Just look at some of the recent headlines from New York Times opinion pieces about college: “More on the Firing of That N.Y.U. Professor” and "There’s Still One Big Trick for Getting Into an Elite College.” Neither elite college grade inflation nor Ivy League admission policies matter much for improving educational opportunity for the average American student.
And, remember that size matters. Community colleges enroll almost 1,000 times more students than Harvard College. As a result, community colleges and state schools like California State lift far more people out of poverty than selective institutions like Harvard, simply because they enroll so many more low income students.
Bottom line: the colleges that teach the most students and have the largest impact on educational opportunity are facing a very different set of problems than elite institutions. So, focusing on these selective schools produces policy discussions divorced from the average college.
Now, to be fair, people often say we should talk about Harvard precisely so that we can expand the opportunities here. Maybe it’s fine to focus on our school if you’re trying to democratize access. I think this approach is backwards. If you want to expand educational opportunities, the last place you should look is Harvard.
Before I say why, let me make clear that diversity at Harvard is important. For example, we should recruit and accept more low-income students (as I’ve argued here). But, we shouldn’t pretend that the stakes to these debates extend beyond our gates.
Efforts at campus inclusion face a fundamental mathematical limit. Just from a numbers perspective, it’s hard to argue that changing the composition of our incoming class will help anyone except those admitted. As Noah Smith points out, even if we doubled the size of the Ivy League, the effect on educational opportunity would be small.
Granted, there’s a representational benefit to having a more diverse campus. And maybe having a more diverse incoming class will lead to a more diverse society. But sometimes these discussions are akin to fighting over the ethnic make-up of Goldman Sachs’ C-Suite: a beneficial yet ultimately superficial gain.
Elite representation does nothing to help the most disadvantaged groups who never even enter elite spaces. As Marxist Philosopher Adolph Reed argues, focusing on diversity within high-income spaces (like Harvard) is a shallow form of egalitarianism because we should care more about distributing the wealth of the top 1 percent rather than making the 1 percent match the diversity of the 99 percent.
None of this abdicates Harvard’s responsibility to be more inclusive, but we must understand that other school systems — who face categorically different problems — have a bigger effect on higher education's inclusivity than any initiative at Harvard ever could.
Here are some policy questions I never see discussed in The Crimson or by student activists. What are the most effective tactics for decreasing dropout rates at community colleges? How can state-level spending be reorganized to guarantee higher levels of funding for local schools like Cal State? These are the sorts of questions that will have the most impact on access to higher education.
And, more relevant to us as students, what can Harvard do to partner with these institutions? There’s certainly greater space for interactions between selective and non-selective institutions. Joint-research initiatives could spread cutting edge research around the country, and student exchange programs could build greater connections between schools.
Let’s spend more time writing about, researching, and debating ideas like these that look outwards from Harvard.
If you care about expanding educational opportunity, then a focus on selective institutions makes very little sense. I understand the irony here. I’m writing a piece about Harvard saying we should talk less about Harvard. But we should all keep in mind the stakes surrounding discussions about our school – while not unimportant – are lower than we think.

The Harvard Undergraduate Association discussed the search for the University’s next president and campus initiatives at its general meeting Sunday.
Caleb K. King ’23, who serves on the 18-member student advisory group counseling the presidential search committee, joined the meeting to provide insight on the process and solicit student input. King is one of three undergraduates in the advisory group, which also has members from all of Harvard’s graduate schools.
During the meeting, HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 suggested distributing a survey seeking undergraduate input and preparing a summarized report for the advisory group, but King replied that the advisory group has already sent out an official survey, noting the committee will likely “lean towards” that one over an undergraduate-led one.
HUA members enumerated qualities they would like to see in the next Harvard president. Academics Officer Shikoh M. Hirabayashi ’24 said he hopes the next University president will prioritize mental health initiatives and support Harvard employees.
Johnson added that he hopes the next president will be accessible and visible to students.
“That would be pretty cool if we saw our presidents walking around the Yard and you could go have coffee with them for five minutes,” he said.
Johnson, HUA Co-President Lylena D. Estabine ’24, and Well-Being Officer Hana Rehman ’25 presented takeaways from their meeting with Harvard University Police Department Chief Victor A. Clay on student concerns. At a town hall earlier this month, students shared concerns about campus safety, including about the lighting levels in Harvard Yard and Cambridge Commons.
“We will likely be speaking to the City of Cambridge about the regulations in terms of lumen levels in both the Yard and Cambridge Commons to allow for more safety,” Estabine said.
During Sunday’s meeting, the Association also voted on a new project to organize an open mic night at the Queen’s Head Pub. The Queen’s Head Pub, located in the basement of Annenberg Hall, reopened this month for the first time since 2019.
Social Life Officer John S. Cook ’25 said the open mic night proposal aims to publicize the Pub and support student performers. The proposal, which will appropriate $2,000 from the HUA Social Life budget, passed with a majority vote.
The open mic night is set to take place on Nov. 12.

Students made dolls, trick-or-treated, and watched black-and-white films at Lamont Library on Friday to celebrate Halloween at the library’s first-ever Lamonster Mash.
Librarian for Undergraduate Support Yoonha Hwang, who co-organized the event, said part of its goal was to “bring a little bit of excitement” to the term “Lamonster” and make students more comfortable using the library’s resources. Students who haunt Lamont’s study spaces late at night are often dubbed “Lamonsters” by their peers.
During the event, attendees decorated colorful plastic masks with buttons, feathers, and jewels and created “spell books” using old recipes printed from the Houghton Library archives. The recipes included ways to counter the plague, remove pimples, fix dropsy, preserve oranges, and pickle eels.
Many attendees flocked to one craft station to make dolls from yarn, pipe cleaners, glue, and wooden beads.
“I think the highlight was the doll making,” Madison J. Davis ’26 said.
One attendee made a hippo, while another made Baby Yoda. Other students made well-known Halloween monsters like Dracula and werewolves.
“It's definitely a lot of fun. I'm very glad they have this,” Jennifer “Jenny” Hong ’23 said. “I haven’t made a craft in years.”
In addition to craft making, students stopped by offices and exhibits in the library to trick-or-treat. Alice L. Liu ’26 said the event allowed her to explore more of Lamont.
“I actually went to the user research center,” she said. “I didn’t even know that existed before.”
At the first trick-or-treating station, Jess Cohen Tanugi, Lamont’s visualization specialist, handed out paper bags for candy collection, candy, pop sockets, and other Harvard Library knick-knacks.
“I love it — It's so cool,” Tanugi said about the event. “It's a great way to talk to students.”
In an interview before the event, Hwang said the idea stemmed from an August conversation she had with co-organizer Susan Gilroy, who serves as the librarian for undergraduate programs for writing.
“We were just talking about events we'd like to see at the library, and I mentioned to her I'd love to do some sort of trick-or-treating at the library event,” they said. “It just grew from there.”
Hwang added that many students feel a "sense of endearment" for the nickname "Lamonster."
“Some of them wear it like a badge of pride,” she said.

A panel of legal scholars hosted at Harvard Law School on Thursday discussed the future of United States abortion law following the Supreme Court’s decision in June to overturn the constitutional right to abortion.
The panel, hosted by the HLS Federalist Society — a conservative and libertarian student organization — featured Erin M. Hawley from the Alliance Defending Freedom and Nicole Huberfeld, a Boston University Law School professor. HLS civil procedure professor Stephen E. Sachs ’02 moderated the conversation.
Huberfeld, who specializes in state healthcare policy, stated that this moment in history can be characterized by “confusion, chaos, and conflict” as some states work to restrict abortion access while others try to protect it.
“You see states like Virginia and Vermont and California proposing this: allowing abortions up until the moment of birth, or right before birth, for absolutely no reason,” Hawley said. “On the other hand, I can see other states kind of saying that ‘our state has chosen to protect life.’”
Hawley cited a lack of societal support for motherhood as a prime factor to obtain an abortion, saying that employers are willing to help women access abortions but will often not accommodate mothers already raising children.
Hawley said she believes abortion “is not necessary for women to succeed" and noted the differences in the financial support offered to employed women seeking abortions compared to those managing childcare.
“They’re offering a flight for female attorneys or paralegals or office staff to different places in order to obtain abortions,” Hawley said. “But are those same companies offering diapers, are they offering childcare?”
“Seventy-five percent of women who obtained an abortion said that they would have chosen to parent if circumstances were different,” she added.
The discussion comes in the wake of a student walk-out in protest of a panel hosted by Harvard Law Students for Life — which also featured Sachs as a speaker — earlier this month. Roughly 75 HLS students participated in the protest.
Huberfeld added that the conflicting state and federal abortion policies will impact how care is provided.
“There's a lot of moral distress among healthcare providers — they don't know what this chaos means,” she said.
“Doctors tend to be risk averse, professionally speaking, and to operate in places where they are told to be risk averse,” Huberfeld added. “The default will be not to provide care rather than to, and so there will be impacts on care.”

UPDATED: November 5, 2022, at 6:45 a.m.
A team of Harvard and MIT researchers has discovered accuracy limitations in climate models used to describe the properties of exoplanets — planets outside the solar system — given an influx of cosmic data from the newly launched James Webb Space Telescope.
The team advises that the models, which researchers use to probe exoplanets’ atmospheres and learn more about their history and potential to host life, be revised in light of the extraordinarily precise data of the Webb Telescope.
The study — published last month in Nature Astronomy — details how existing methods, which are used to characterize the atmospheres of nearby planetary bodies, can misinterpret data collected by Webb. This accuracy pitfall, which the astronomers refer to as the “opacity challenge,” chiefly concerns models that explore how atmospheres emit light markers depending on their chemical properties.
Robert J. Hargreaves, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a co-author of the paper, said that opacity models make use of the way matter in an exoplanet’s atmosphere interacts with light from its nearby star.
“You essentially trace where light would travel through this atmosphere, and depending on what molecules are present, the temperature, or how big the atmosphere is, you get different absorptions or different strengths of absorption,” Hargreaves said. “That allows you to understand which molecules are present and all the parameters of the atmosphere.”
The researchers discovered that current opacity models had “good fits” with Webb data but could be subject to highly diverging interpretations of an exoplanet’s atmosphere, though the interpretations all emerged from the same spectral data.
Webb’s high resolution and sensitivity rendered current opacity models inadequate interpreters, and with only these insufficient models, the team was unable to determine the temperatures, atmosphere’s elemental composition, and pressure properties of the exoplanets.
Julien de Wit, an MIT planetary science professor who co-led the study, compared the opacity challenge to an out-of-date Rosetta Stone, a translation tool used to decipher ancient texts.
“We have to upgrade these ‘Rosetta Stones,’ which are these opacity models, so that we can really get the subtleties and extract all of the information in these spectra,” he said.
Iouli E. Gordon, a CFA researcher and a co-author of the study, said that opacity models begin with information derived from the CFA’s High-Resolution Transmission and High-Temperature databases, which compile spectral data from a slew of experimental observations and theoretical calculations.
The data then inform the code to predict the properties of exoplanetary atmospheres. To increase accuracy, existing databases should be expanded by adding more data points, according to Gordon.
De Wit likened the shortcomings of having a limited set of planetary data points to attempts at predicting the outcome of a political election where all candidates are from the same family. The planets of the solar system likewise emerged from the same primordial cloud of gas and dust and thus do not offer a diverse sample of possible planets.
"There are different human beings but they share the same histories and values, so your sample size will be biased — same thing with the planet of a solar system,” de Wit said. “But the thing is, even though they are different, they’re formed around the same star around the same time, and so we are going to have a limited understanding of all the complex processes that can be happening there."
Gordon said the remote-sensing quality of opacity modeling can apply to a diverse range of fields beyond exoplanets because molecular spectroscopy can be employed “anywhere you have light being absorbed by gaseous media.”
One example cited by Gordon is that researchers in France used the HITRAN and HITEMP spectroscopic databases to maximize the taste of champagne, which they related to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the champagne glass, while Hargreaves discussed possible medical applications to monitor patient breathing and make diagnoses.
“It’s very rewarding for us quantum chemists that what we calculate or measure and then compile in this reference data — it can be used in so many different fields,” Gordon said.
Gordon also cited the far-reaching nature of the team’s work on opacity models to urge scientists to embrace collaborative work across disciplines.
“The message to everybody is: don’t sit only in your laboratory and think that your problem is very narrow,” Gordon said. “It could be so much more rewarding if it is broader and there is interaction with other scientists.”

A soccer player before tearing his ACL, Andrew C. Holmes ’24 turned to running as a reentry point to physical activity.
Next April, he will run 26.2 miles in the 127th Boston Marathon.
“My knee is now reasonably good, but running is the kind of thing you can do with your ACL in terms of getting back to a sport, so I wanted to get back and challenge myself,” Holmes said.
Holmes is one of five undergraduates running in the Boston Marathon through the Harvard College Marathon Challenge to raise money for the Phillips Brooks House Association, a campus public service group.
Runners can participate in the Boston Marathon on behalf of a charity like PBHA or through qualifying based on their time.
Next spring’s installment of the Boston Marathon marks the 10th anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing, a domestic terrorist attack that killed three people and injured more than 250 others.
“Before I even knew what a marathon was, I had known the Boston Marathon because it’s the most famous one,” said Jacob R. Jimenez ’24, who will run with HCMC. “A few years back, it became this symbol, not just of excellence and running anymore, but of the strength of the city and of resilience.”
Annie Miall ’23, a first-time marathon runner, is running to represent her lab at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Miall aims to raise $10,000 through the marathon to support the lab’s research in cornea diseases, a cause she described as “incredibly meaningful.”
Miall said the race carries special significance in part because she is a senior and a Boston local who frequently attended the marathon growing up.
“Running this race is almost symbolic of the past four years of college as well,” she said. “I think running the marathon is a celebration of my time here at Harvard.”
Maia J. Alberts ’23, a first-time runner in the Boston Marathon and a HCMC member, said it is “so powerful” to hear other runners’ motivations for participating.
“It’s such an odd thing for huge masses of people to get together and be like, ‘I’m going to run a weird, arbitrary distance for, at face value, no particular reason at all.’” Alberts said. “ It’s really the people that have empowered me to be in this place.”
Michael D. Wallace ’22-’23, also a first-time HCMC runner, said he looks forward to participating in the marathon because of the “dedication that comes out from the entire Boston community.”
HCMC participant Paz E. Meyers ’25, who previously rowed for the lightweight crew team, said he has enjoyed training alongside other runners.

“For me personally, the team and community environment was a big part of what I enjoyed so much about rowing,” Meyers said. “The fact that I’m now able to find another great community in the running world for support and training is also really awesome.”
For all the marathon’s charity runners, fundraising is another aspect of preparation.
“[HCMC] can keep you on track as far as both your training and your fundraising and also just people to talk to and connect with and do it with, because all these types of things are much more fun when you do them together with other people,” said Meyers, a Crimson news editor.
Alberts said fundraising through marathons can “do so much good” and generate money for “really worthy causes.”
“Being able to run for a cause that I care about, something that directly impacts people in not just the Harvard community but beyond that, in the places I have the privilege of running in — I think that’s incredibly meaningful,” Alberts said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON — Students and advocates on both sides of the affirmative action debate descended on the nation’s capital on Sunday for dueling rallies ahead of Supreme Court oral arguments in a pair of lawsuits that could end race-conscious admissions in American higher education.
More than 200 people flocked to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in downtown Washington for a pro-affirmative action rally called Affirm Diversity. Across town, the Asian American Coalition for Education hosted an anti-affirmative action demonstration on the steps of the Supreme Court, featuring Students for Fair Admissions founder Edward J. Blum.
For the last eight years, Blum has spearheaded legal efforts to end race-conscious admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina — the latest in his decades-long campaign to outlaw affirmative action. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for both cases Monday morning.
Janai S. Nelson, president and director-counsel of the Legal Defense Fund, kicked off the pro-affirmative action Affirm Diversity event, followed by dozens of speakers, including student organizers and civil rights activists.
“We are here today because, as Justice Sotomayor wrote in a 2014 dissenting opinion, race matters,” Nelson said. “Race matters, for reasons that are not only skin deep, that cannot be discussed any other way, and that cannot be wished away.”
Harvard freshman Isabella P. John, who traveled to Washington to attend the event, said she felt called to show her support for affirmative action in part due to the generations of activists who have defended the practice.
“We wouldn't be doing our part for the future generation to not be here like people before us have done,” John said.
Taliajah M. “Teddy” Vann, UNC’s student body president, said affirmative action allows admissions officers to consider an applicant in their entirety.
“The people who reviewed my UNC application were able to see all the things that I talked about, all the struggles of my experience in my life, all the things that I’ve been able to accomplish and what I value,” Vann said.
“They also knew the kind of environment that I was coming from, and made an informed decision about what I must be to have gotten here in spite of all those experiences,” she added.
Harvard’s Black Students Association bussed and flew out more than 100 students to attend a Legal Defense Fund-sponsored event scheduled to be held in front of the Supreme Court on Monday. David E. Lewis ’24, political action chair of the BSA, said in his speech that student activists will continue to advocate for affirmative action programs even if the court rules against Harvard.
“I am not afraid or worried because I know that regardless of the outcome of this case, our struggle will not end here, nor will it end when the court's decision is released,” Lewis said. “This is still just the beginning.”
Hundreds of protesters attended the rally staged by the Asian American Coalition for Education in support of SFFA at the same time as the Affirm Diversity event. Activists, including college and high school students, held signs on the steps of the Supreme Court calling for an end to affirmative action in higher education.
AACE President Yukong “Mike” Zhao said in a speech at the rally that affirmative action has harmful psychological impacts on Asian American students by creating a pressure to work harder for admission.
“Using race in college admissions is wrong because it unjustly imposes higher admissions standards,” Zhao said.
In a speech at the rally, Blum, the SFFA president, described race-conscious admissions as “divisive,” saying that by considering race as a factor, schools pit applicants against each other.
“It is a moral failure that our most competitive universities place high schoolers — like the kids we have just heard from — on racial registers and tell the world that their skin color affects what they think and what they know, and what they like and what they don't like.”
Blum, who is not a lawyer, has orchestrated an array of legal efforts seeking to ban affirmative action — including a pair of lawsuits against the University of Texas that alleged the school discriminated against a rejected white applicant, Abigail M. Fischer, because of her race. The Supreme Court narrowly upheld the university’s race-conscious admissions program in a 2016 ruling on the case, but with a newly expanded conservative majority, many experts expect a different result this time around.
“Eliminating legacy preferences, preferences for children of faculty and staff, children of wealthy donors, while giving a greater weight to students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, will produce an individualized and diverse student body without treating students differently by race,” Blum said on Sunday.
Calvin Yang, a sophomore at UC Berkeley who also spoke at the event, said in an interview he believes Harvard should craft an admissions program that considers socioeconomic diversity instead of racial diversity.
“It's a fact that African Americans and Hispanic Americans, unfortunately, suffer from a higher incidence of poverty rate, compared to the national average,” Yang said. “But Harvard can help remedy and ensure this racial inequality by instituting systems similar to that, as opposed to purely race where you're just looking at one skin color.”
Lee C. Cheng ’93, a lawyer from California who heads the Asian American Legal Foundation, said in an interview that the rally was “about allowing students to apply to Harvard without having skin color become determinative.”
“This is the most incredible gathering I have seen in my 30 years fighting racial discrimination in the name of diversity and affirmative action, both of which are very worthy causes,” he said.
More rallies are scheduled for Monday at the Supreme Court building, where oral arguments are set to begin in the UNC case after 10 a.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 31, 2022, at 6:30 p.m.
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court oral arguments concluded just prior to 3 p.m. Monday in a pair of lawsuits seeking to ban affirmative action in American higher education.
The suits, brought against Harvard and the University of North Carolina by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, were taken up by the Supreme Court in January after lower courts ruled in favor of both schools.
The court is considering the two cases separately. Justices heard arguments in the UNC case first, beginning at 10 a.m. Lawyers in the Harvard case began presenting at around 1 p.m. Follow live updates below:
Oral arguments concluded just prior to 3 p.m. Monday after more than five hours across the two cases.
The court’s conservative majority aggressively questioned lawyers from Harvard and UNC, signaling skepticism toward their arguments in favor of race-conscious admissions.
Demonstrations outside the court largely died down during the oral arguments, with most rallygoers departing around 12 p.m. Throughout the morning, pro-affirmative action advocates dominated the area around the courthouse steps, where they held signs and led chants calling on the court to uphold race-conscious admissions.
An array of top Harvard administrators attended Monday’s hearing, including former University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, Harvard College Admissions and Financial Aid Dean William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, and former Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, who argued the case for Harvard before a lower court.
Seth P. Waxman ’73, former U.S. Solicitor General and the lawyer arguing on behalf of Harvard, asserted that diversity in higher education “benefits our nation.”
“Our future as a country depends on having leaders who have enjoyed wide exposure to students as diverse as the nation itself, and so, as this court has consistently held, if necessary to achieve genuine diversity, a university need not blind itself to race,” Waxman said.
When repeatedly asked by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., why Asian students receive the “lowest personal scores” of any group in Harvard’s admissions process, Waxman cited the findings of lower courts, which concluded that there was “no evidence of discrimination in admissions outcomes.”
Waxman explained that personal rating is assigned to an application file by an admissions officer “just as a matter of triage” and that the score “fades into the background” later in the admissions decision process.
“It is not considered in any way once the subcommittees and committees meet,” Waxman said. “It is not the basis of admissions decisions.”
When pressed by Alito on the relevance of the personal score, Waxman added that the rating “does not make a statistical difference” but provides a “rational way” for admissions officers to determine how to allocate their attention among the tens of thousands of applications Harvard receives each year.
“The fact that Asian Americans got on average a marginally lower personal rating score is no more evidence of discrimination against them than the fact that they got a marginally higher rating than any data can show on academics and extracurriculars,” he said. “It doesn't mean that they're either smarter or people think they're smarter.”
Following a short recess after arguments for the UNC lawsuit, the Court heard oral arguments for SFFA’s case against Harvard. SFFA lawyer Cameron T. Norris asked the Court to rule against Harvard’s use of race in admissions and overturn Grutter, arguing that “none of Grutter’s core assumptions were ever true.”
“Race is a minus for Asians, a group that continues to face immense racial discrimination in this country,” Norris said. “Asians should be getting into Harvard more than whites, but they don’t because Harvard gives them significantly lower personal ratings.”
Norris also alleged that Harvard makes admissions decisions “based on the box that applicants check” about their race and said that the University did not consider race-neutral alternatives until 2017 — three years after SFFA filed its first suit against Harvard.
Justices questioned Norris about how a university might consider the applications of students who write about experiences related to racial identity in their admissions essays and discussed limitations of race-neutral admissions policies.
United States Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar argued in favor of race-conscious admissions to maintain diversity among the U.S. military, which she said is a “critical national security imperative.”
Prelogar cited benefits to race-conscious admissions previously upheld by the court, including cross-racial understanding, reducing racial isolation and alienation, and reducing racial tension and strife.
“Diversity in higher education is absolutely a compelling interest, and it will remain so,” Prelogar said. “We are not here to suggest that every college and university need to have race-conscious admissions in order to achieve these goals. The fact that there’s been progress along these lines, I think, shows that Grutter is working.”
In response to a question from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., Prelogar said the use of race-conscious admissions is “clearly consistent with the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment.”
“Surrounding the time of enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, there were federal and state laws that took race into account for purposes of trying to achieve the central premise of Fourteenth Amendment to bring African American citizens to a point of equality in our society,” Prelogar said.
David S. Hinojosa — a director of the Education Opportunities Project under the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law — appeared before the court to represent UNC students and alumni of color. In his argument for the consideration of race as a factor in admissions, he pointed to the university’s “over 160 years of exclusion and its present day effects.”
“There is zero evidence for playing the decisive factor for any applicant,” Hinojosa said. “There is zero evidence of any student being penalized for their race, or if they were admitted, that they were not qualified.”
North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Y. Park, who is arguing on behalf of UNC, invoked Brown v. Board of Education — a landmark case that in 1954 decided that racial segregation in schools is unconstitutional — to defend UNC’s consideration of race in its admissions process.
“Diversity is our nation’s greatest source of strength,” Park said in his opening statement.
Justices questioned Park about the educational benefits provided by diversity and how long race will be considered in admissions.
Park argued the court’s precedents have held that educational diversity is a “compelling interest of the highest order.”
“The correctness of these precedents is confirmed by the historical record, which shows beyond doubt that our Reconstruction founders believed that race conscious measures designed to promote an integrated learning environment are consistent with the original public meaning of the protection clause,” Park said.
In a brief opening statement SFFA lawyer Patrick Strawbridge asked justices to overturn precedent set by the Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld universities’ ability to consider race in the admissions process.
“Racial classifications are wrong,” Strawbridge said.
Strawbridge faced sharp questions from justices about the use of race-neutral alternatives and whether race is a deciding factor in admissions at UNC.
Hundreds of demonstrators filled the area around the Supreme Court ahead of oral arguments Monday morning. Many lined up hoping to get into the court’s chambers.
Peter Capote, a U.S. senate intern, arrived at the court at 3:30 a.m. Monday in hopes of attending oral arguments.
“It’s something that’s quite historical and you only get a rare chance to see landmark cases,” said Peter Capote Capote, a U.S. Senate intern.
Hundreds of students from around the country traveled to Washington over the weekend to demonstrate ahead of the case. David A. Spicer, the student body president at MIT, waited in line beginning at 8:30 p.m. Sunday night to get a seat at oral arguments.
“A lot of students are interested in this issue, so I wanted to be here as the conversation was taking place,” he said.

Midterm paper got you down? Me too, babe. But it’s Harvard’s world and we’re just living in it. Best get those essays in on time or else face the wrath of the Writing Gods (or a passive-aggressive email from your TF).
Never fear, Flyby is here! With plenty of suggestions of varying absurdity to help you kick that writer’s block to the curb, let’s help you conquer that deadline!
Word vomit
Just write, you know? Whatever comes to mind, put it down. You could write pages and pages of random thoughts you have, I’m sure something will be of use. This works especially well if you already have a topic in mind, but feel free to try it freestyle, too. You can’t start editing until you at least write something!
Trade phones
Are you watching TikTok instead of writing and just can’t seem to put the phone down? We’ve all been there. Hand the phone to a roommate or study buddy and tell them to keep it safe while you suffer through this essay. Distraction: eliminated. Now just try not to get distracted by your friend. Or your computer. Or your surroundings.
Consult your STEM friends
They won’t be helpful, but you’ll realize that if you aren’t the one writing, then they’ll have to be, and we can’t have that happening, can we?
Take a walk
Fresh air really has the power to kick you into gear, especially now that it's nice and brisk outside. One step into the Cambridge wind will have you running back inside, ready to do anything so long as you don’t have to walk back out there.
Perform a ritualistic sacrifice
Take some candles, set them in a circle, and place an old essay or article in the center. You may burn it if you feel strongly. The Writing Gods will see this sacrifice and grant you new material to write in exchange. I will take no questions on the subject.
Coffee break (!!!)
Reward yourself: it's hard work staring at a blank paper while you desperately try to pull something insightful from the depths of your burnt-out brain. I’m totally more productive when I have a yummy Starbucks mocha in my hand (a lie I tell myself to justify the purchase).
Give Up
Can’t have writer's block if you’re not trying to write, simple as that (jk do your work please). But if you need something to procrastinate, just check @flybyblog on insta ;)
Now that you’ve gotten over your writer’s block (because this article was so helpful, obviously), it's time to get out there and put some words on paper! And no, I will not be answering emails from angry proctors who want to know why their students are setting off the fire alarm with fifteen lit candles in their dorms. Happy writing, folks!
