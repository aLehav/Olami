After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allston residents demanded further revisions to the planned relocation of the Charlesview Apartments, while others who live in the complex urged that the plan go forward at a crowded and contentious Monday meeting -- the first public discussion since Harvard agreed to add 1.74 acres of land to the proposed new home for the apartments.
The current Charlesview Apartments, an aging concrete complex that sits at the entrance of the University’s new Allston campus, is slated to be relocated as part of a land swap agreement with the University, filed in February of 2008. The first redevelopment design proposed 12 taller buildings spread across 6.91 acres of Harvard-owned property about a half-mile away on Western Avenue at the Brighton Mills shopping center. The new plans -- proposed in July by non-profit developers Charlesview Inc. and The Community Builders -- would instead have more than double that number of low-rise buildings on 8.65 acres that include the additional land from Harvard.
But improvements in the current proposal were not good enough, Allston and Brighton residents said. A handful of community members picketed along Western Avenue before the meeting, chanting “"A better plan is what we need; we say no to Harvard's greed.”
"The project is fundamentally flawed," said Harry Mattison, an Allston resident and member of the Harvard Allston Task Force, an advisory panel of local residents appointed by the Mayor. "It doesn't matter how much talent you have trying to design the project if you don't have enough land."
The initial proposal for relocating the dilapidated 213-unit Charlesview apartment drew criticism for its overcrowded housing, insufficient parking, and disproportionately high number of rental units.
Last night, residents denounced the new plan for continuing to economically segregate housing, as the more expensive complexes would still be concentrated along the river. More public park land and retail space was needed, they added.
But amid the brouhaha of objections raised, several Charlesview residents lashed out at their neighbors for attempting to delay the move, thereby forcing them to remain in the aging apartments while the developers modify the proposal again. One community member attested to the poor living conditions, describing the use of tarp to direct rainwater leaking from the roof into buckets placed along the hallways.
"I'm so sick of waiting," said Phyllis Lingley, 83, who has been living in the Charlesview apartments for 40 years. "This has been going on for years, and we haven't seen a damn thing built."
She joined the majority of Charlesview residents in indicating that they wanted the Boston Redevelopment Authority to go ahead with the proposal.
The palpable tensions from over 100 people crowded into the meeting room built as frustrated Allston and Brighton residents pointed accusatory fingers at Harvard and called for the Boston Redevelopment Authority to reject the proposal until it met their expectations.
Since the land swap negotiations, Harvard has "washed its hands" of Charlesview development plans, residents alleged. Though the University is not directly involved with developing the proposal, several residents said Harvard should take a more active role in shaping relocation plans. 
Kevin A. McCluskey '76, Harvard's senior director of community relations for Boston, reminded the community members during the meeting that University President Drew G. Faust had made clear earlier this year that the pace at which Harvard expands has slowed in light of the turbulent economic climate.

"Our responsibility from the very beginning was to respect the Charlesview board," McCluskey said in an interview after the meeting. He added that he hopes residents will not overlook the "broader impact" Harvard has had on the community, citing initiatives such as the education portal opened last summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AT&T users venturing into the Quad may no longer have to worry about dropped calls or spotty cell phone service starting next month.
A cell on wheels -- a trailer containing signal transmission and reception equipment known as a COW -- has recently been set up next to Cabot House's Barnard Hall, located on the southwest corner of the Quad.
The "visually obtrusive" COW, operational on Sept. 1, serves as a temporary solution for providing reliable AT&T wireless service in the Quad until a permanent antenna is installed next fall, following city and state approval, said Zachary M. Gingo '98, director of Faculty of Arts and Sciences' Facilities Management and Operations. The permanent antenna will be placed on the roof of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, hidden from view.
Harvard has been working with AT&T on the issue since last winter, and the service provider will fund the bulk of the project, Gingo said.
He added that Harvard is "actively exploring" similar partnerships with other providers, as students have reported reception problems with companies other than Verizon, in particular, Sprint and T-Mobile.
Though students have long pushed for improved cell phone reception in the Quad, the problem was brought to the immediate attention of Harvard administrators following the May 18 shooting in Kirkland House, when several Quad residents reported not receiving the University's emergency text message notifications.
Undergraduate Council representative and Currier House resident George J.J. Hayward ’11, who adopted improved cell phone service in the Quad as a central component of his election campaign last year, collected over 300 messages from Quad residents about poor reception over the last academic year.
Hayward, who is also a Crimson editorial writer, could not be reached for comment. He told The Crimson in May that once he was able to "demonstrate substantial concern," administrators readily agreed to pursue the issue.
