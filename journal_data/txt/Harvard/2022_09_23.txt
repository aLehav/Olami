After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 7, Mt. Auburn Street lost a beloved giant of popular Harvard Square chains. The iconic, delectable El Jefe’s moved from its original spot by Tasty Burger to a larger, more expansive location a tad closer to the Yard (and their rival Felipe’s) on JFK Street. The move came with an upgraded interior as well, with two stories of seating and a larger space for eating, talking, and general loitering. Although nearly everything new about the popular Mexican joint was changed for the better, the memory of old El Jefe’s — cozy, familiar, and grimy — still lingers. So, let’s see how the new location measures up, piece by piece.
The Space – 8/10
At first glance, the space is an intoxicated college student’s dream. There are two stories of seating, more room for the food line (which can grow to snake all the way up the stairs), and more space to socialize. While this expanded capacity is great business for El Jefe’s, attracting even more customers, it has also led to increased wait times and foot traffic within the Mexican joint. However long the wait may be, at least El Jefe’s has the space to support it. As a prime spot of late-night eats for college students, the restaurant’s choice to expand their square footage and capacity was a smart idea and will only bring in more business for them.
The Location – 7/10
There’s not much to say here when El Jefe’s move was only about 200 feet down the street. However, those 200 feet make more of a difference than one might initially think. The new storefront borders a high foot-traffic street, and its bold, shiny new letters are much more noticeable than the diminutive painted sign of the original El Jefe’s. This location is also slightly closer to the Yard and to Felipe’s, their largest competitor. The late-night spot has lost that grungy, tucked-away feel of the old El Jefe’s that people know and love, but all in all, it is a great place to be.
The Food – 7/10
This category may seem inane because quality of food is (hopefully) unaffected by location. Indeed, the new El Jefe’s lives up to its predecessor, offering the same classic options. Their burritos are still reliably delicious, and their horchatas are still sickeningly sweet. While the location and space have improved, this ingredient in El Jefe’s success — its food — has thankfully remained the same. And yet, is an El Jefe’s burrito really that good or does it just hit that sweet spot at the right time? El Jefe’s popularity is a result of many ingredients: late night hours, prime location, comfortable space – many of which have been improved with their move.
The late-night vibe of that cramped, cozy, and slightly homely original El Jefe’s will be missed. However, El Jefe’s only stands to grow their business by expanding their space and moving to a more prominent location in the square and attracting even more Harvardians.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ada Limón, recently named the 24th Poet Laureate of the United States, loves stories. And she knows where to find them. They are brought out from a thoughtful consideration of the world around her: in the slipperiness of a groundhog stealing tomatoes from her garden, in a hawk wing nailed to the wall. They are also found in her own past, her emotions, and the people whom she has loved. Her dazzling new poetry collection, “The Hurting Kind,” will force a reader to sit in quiet contemplation after each poem, marveling at the beauty and power with which Limón wields her extraordinary gift of paying attention.
Within the pages of Limón’s collection is a demand for readers to think more deeply about the world around them. In her poem entitled “The First Lesson,” Limón remembers watching as her mother studied a hawk wing found on the side of the road: “I watched / and learned to watch / closely the world.” This habit of observation undergirds Limón’s collection. She devotes many poems to nature and its creatures: the fig buttercup, the forsythia, the foals, the fox. Other poems are dedicated to family, past and present partners, and friends.
The 57 poems in this collection are divided int0 four sections, each named after a season. Beginning with Spring, and ending with Winter, the poems are shaped from Limón’s observations combined with her own contemplation and reflection about what she has witnessed. This is beautifully shown in her poem “Invasive,” where her visible surroundings are described and linked to something deeper: “I am trying to kill the fig buttercup / the way I’m supposed to according / to the government website, / but right now there’s a bee on it. / Yellow on yellow, two things / radiating life. I need them both / to go on living.” This mix of observation, reflection, and description of her own experience delightfully combine in many of the poems of this collection. Mundane life experiences are given a thoughtful second look as Limón reconstructs them with stunning imagery and attention to detail.
This collection contains works written in both poetry and prose. The presentation of Limón’s work is always playful, sometimes written in columns never exceeding a three-word width, sometimes stretching over multiple pages with spaces between short stanzas. The varied layouts elevate the feeling that the works in “The Hurting Kind” are like journal entries, a personal record of thoughts about the world and the speaker’s place in it. There are no rules for what is written about, nor how it is presented.
Within this collection, one finds Limón’s wonderings, anxieties, and memories, which are transferred into surprising corollaries to the real world. Ordinary observations become windows into the author’s mind. In her poem “Glimpse,” Limón writes about the cat that used to belong to her husband’s ex-girlfriend who passed away: “She / is an ancient cat, and prickly. / When we are alone, I sing / full throated in the empty house / and she meows and mewls / like we’ve done this before / but we haven’t done this before.” A reader almost gets goosebumps from the way Limón can craft her stories, always knowing exactly where to end her words to leave the reader sitting in awe.
This collection is achingly genuine, and covers such intimate topics in Limón’s life as her parents divorce, her grandfather’s death, and her changing view of love. But while her work touches upon many different subjects, the journal-like feeling of her poems allows her collection to have breadth without feeling disjointed. What strings everything together is that these poems are personal reflections. This collection is a roadmap of Limón’s mind that is thoroughly enjoyable to read; in her thoughts readers gain access to a view of the world that is introspective, uncannily observant, and genuine. In her poems a reader can find a companion. Limón dares us to pay more attention to all that we interact with: the natural world, our memories, and each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday night, A- to D-list celebrities gathered in the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles to celebrate the one industry that truly boomed throughout the pandemic: television.
The 74th Emmy Awards honored this past year’s best moments in television — but the ceremony itself does not make that list. The annual television spectacle started strong, got progressively worse, and eventually lost its celebratory sparkle.
Kenan Thompson hosted the Emmy Awards with a refreshing whiff of self-irony, a heavy amount of Netflix slander, and an overall decent comedic timing. For reasons unknown, the opening musical number mainly celebrated shows from the past. If the $1 billion Warner Bros. makes annually from “Friends” syndication revenue is insufficient, the opening was at least a fantastic advertisement for Central Perk. Between the opening number that involved slightly too much fire and ugly wigs, Thompson understood his assignment, which was to “celebrate the hundreds of shows that were produced and give awards to five of them,” as he so graciously stated during his opening monologue.
Thompson skillfully poked fun at the old “escapism through media theory,” explaining that television enables people to forget the news about “rich people being greedy and shady,” by offering them “shows like Succession, Ozark, and Better Call Saul.” After taking the first of his two admittedly hilarious jabs at Netflix, Thompson congratulated Zendaya on her 26th birthday, saying that she might be “young enough to play a high school student… but too old to date Leonardo DiCaprio.” Granted, DiCaprio might have a less ecstatic opinion of Thompson’s speech, but it was undoubtedly one of the show's highlights before it started to go downhill. It would be unfair to solely blame Jimmy Kimmel’s controversial antics for said gradual descent, but laying on stage and playing dead not once but twice certainly does not scream peak comedy. Sorry, Jimmy!
After Thompson’s opening monologue, it was up to Lizzo, Jennifer Coolidge, and Sheryl Lee Ralph to entertain the masses while many unsurprising winners were announced and many deserving nominees were snubbed.
In a fabulous red-ruffled gown, Lizzo twerked her way onto the stage, and Jennifer Coolidge decided to launch a much-need revolution against the play-off music. Many times artists came up on stage only to be immediately cut off mid-speech — but not Coolidge, who simply decided to dance along to the orchestra’s futile attempt at unceremoniously booting her offstage. Though hilarious, the award for the most inspiring speech of the night belongs to Sheryl Lee Ralph, who was visibly shocked by her win for “Abbott Elementary.” She sat in her seat motionless for what felt like ages until she was finally dragged on stage by co-star Tyler James Williams to accept her Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy. After taking a deep breath, Ralph sang Dianne Reeves’ song “Endangered Species,” before delivering the speech of the night. “To anyone, who has ever, ever had a dream and thought your dream wasn’t, wouldn’t, couldn’t come true — I am here to tell you that this is what believing looks like,“ she said. “This is what striving looks like. And don’t you ever, ever give up on you.”
Overall, the voters of the Television Academy seemed to enjoy the old and familiar. As such, the ceremony lacked an element of surprise or novelty. Audience members could have quite frankly glanced at the list of last year's Emmy winners to know how the night would end. “Ted Lasso” took home the award for Outstanding Comedy Series for the second year in a row, and Jason Sudeikis and Brett Goldstein were honored with the Emmy Awards for Outstanding Leading Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series respectively for their performances in the Apple TV+ series.
Writer Mike White and his show “The White Lotus” completely dominated the limited series categories, while “Ozark’”s acclaimed final season sadly lost the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series to HBO’s “Succession,” which had previously taken home the title in 2020. Julia Garner took home the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance as Ruth Langmore in “Ozark,” her third win in the role. Meanwhile, Laura Linney was left empty-handed, once again losing to “Euphoria”’s Zendaya in the category of Outstanding Leading Actress in a Drama Series. While the overall lack of recognition for Linney’s work on all four seasons of “Ozark” is admittedly frustrating, the starpower of Zendaya’s performance remains indisputable.
Even though this year's Emmy winners leaned heavily on nostalgia and primarily favored previous winners over new nominees, two winners will certainly go down in history: Hwang Dong-hyuk and Lee Jung-jae. “Squid Game” creator Hwang Dong-hyuk won for Outstanding Directing of a Drama, and Lee Jung-Jae took home the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. These are groundbreaking wins, considering that “Squid Game” was the first non-English language show to even be nominated for a major award category.
“Squid Game” proved what many already knew: Good television exists beyond Hollywood. Now, it is up to the Television Academy to move past its history of centering European and Anglo-American experiences and values to more accurately represent the best moments in television, wherever they may be.

It is no secret that most people who tune in to the Emmys are most excited to see one thing in particular: the winners. The very nature of an awards show begs the viewer to focus on the fierce competition for the top prizes, which can lead to many unawarded performances getting lost in the excitement of the big night. And with the Emmys’ tendency to favor the same actors year after year, such as Zendaya in “Euphoria” or Jason Sudeikis in “Ted Lasso,” it is even more important to remember the many deserving contenders who went home empty-handed. Below are six such losers whose performances were among the year’s best, some of whom may hopefully snag a trophy next time they are eligible.
1. Laura Linney, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for “Ozark” 
Laura Linney, who lost a third time for her role as Wendy Byrde on Monday night, easily cemented herself as one of the most talented actresses working today during the final season of “Ozark.” As Wendy gradually became the beating heart of the sinister Byrde family over the course of four seasons, Linney quietly ramped up her character’s intensity, leaving the audience in genuine shock when she finally reached the point of no return. Linney manages to portray Wendy’s corruption arc with extreme care, never allowing Wendy’s evil nature to become an over-the-top caricature of a crazed crime boss. The ease with which Linney makes Wendy appear simultaneously even-keeled and completely deranged is a feat worthy of renown (and an Emmy).
2. Adam Scott, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for “Severance”
“Severance,” the buzzy new Apple TV+ drama about the personal toll of the modern workplace, is chock-full of outstanding performances by seasoned actors and newcomers alike. Even still, Adam Scott stands out as the show’s mild-mannered and overly-curious protagonist Mark Scout. Scott, who is best known for his comedic work on “Parks and Recreation,” makes the shift to dramatic television flawlessly, managing to embody two versions of the same character that each possess a unique psyche. Much of the first season centers around Mark’s efforts to piece together increasingly dark revelations about his workplace, and Scott lends a quiet intensity to this search that leaves viewers inching ever closer to the edge of their seat.
3. Janelle James, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for “Abbott Elementary”
Anyone who watches “Abbott Elementary” will be quick to point to Janelle James’ whacky principal character, Ava, as one of the best parts of the show. Every episode, James manages to bring Ava’s absurd narcissism to new heights, pairing her sarcastic comments with a perfectly-timed glance at the camera à la John Krasinski in “The Office.” More impressively, James is able to portray moments of genuine vulnerability and softness amidst Ava’s over-the-top hijinks, a quality demonstrative of a truly outstanding comedic performance. There is no doubt that Ava is rapidly becoming an iconic television character, a much-needed triumph for network television that the Emmys should reward.
4. Rhea Seehorn, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for “Better Call Saul”
Perhaps one of the longest overdue Emmy victories in recent years belongs to Rhea Seehorn, the quiet and subdued foil to Bob Odenkirk’s flashy Saul Goodman on the acclaimed prequel to “Breaking Bad.” While Seehorn’s Kim Wexler may not be the most compelling character at the beginning of the series, by the sixth and final season she dominates the screen by creating an emotionally-rich, three-dimensional character. Despite delivering a performance that is far less flashy than other Emmys contenders, Seehorn nevertheless builds immense suspense with every choice she makes, constantly reminding viewers that Kim’s morality lies in a delicate balance. And when she lets this vulnerability shine through, it can turn a scene of her crying on a bus into one of the most poignant television moments in recent memory. As one half of television’s most complicated couple, Seehorn integrates into the “Breaking Bad” world with ease, becoming a welcome addition to the much-admired canon.
5. Toheeb Jimoh, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for “Ted Lasso” 
While “Ted Lasso” certainly received its flowers from the Emmys this year, winning Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series, Toheeb Jimoh’s performance as the extremely lovable Sam Obisanya was unfortunately overlooked in his category. As Sam, Jimoh perfectly captures the show’s spirit of unadulterated kindness and optimism with his graceful on-screen presence. But more than that, Jimoh adds immense depth to the character of Sam, thus preventing him from becoming a one-dimensional background character and instead providing him with motivations that are truly relatable. Ultimately, Sam is a character whose hopeful attitude and slight naivete never grow old, a sign of a great actor at work.
6. Bowen Yang, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for “Saturday Night Live”
While the Emmys are reluctant to give individual awards to “Saturday Night Live” cast members, Bowen Yang is a more than deserving exception. While only in his third year as a cast member, Yang has managed to establish himself as an SNL giant in his own right through his zany, niche comedic style that keeps viewers on their toes in the best way possible. Whether playing the iceberg that sunk the Titanic, a flamboyant daddy long legs spider, or a disgruntled Oompa Loompa, Yang always commits to the bit with an admirable ferocity and infectious joy that is hard to replicate. As one of SNL’s most innovative and ingenious new comics, Yang has helped to usher in a new generation of viewers to the decades-old variety show, a Herculean feat worthy of television’s highest honor.

Recent years have brought the entertainment world many remakes. Like, so many remakes. And public response seems to have grown increasingly frustrated at this pattern, noting a lack of novelty and creativity. But perhaps this current culture of remakes is owed at least some gratitude, as it has brought into being the wonderful series that is “A League of Their Own.” Hailing from Amazon Prime — a platform not particularly known for its originals — “A League of Their Own” is a comedy-drama tv adaptation of the 1992 film sharing the same name.
The premise is generally the same as that of its predecessor: the series tells a fictionalized account of the Rockford Peaches, a real baseball team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) founded during World War II. The remake, however, colors the film’s original concept with new and refreshing complexities. The heart of the story remains an inspiring, against-all-odds sports drama, but despite its generally lighthearted tone, “A League of Their Own” is a stellar example of how the modern reimagining of a classic creates a renewed opportunity to include previously repressed stories and marginalized identities within the storytelling fold.
In addition to being a fresh take on its source material, the series features stunning performances all around starring Abbi Jacobson (known for Comedy Central series “Broad City”) as Carson Shaw, D’Arcy Carden (Janet in “The Good Place”) as Greta Gill, and Chanté Adams as Maxine “Max” Chapman. Visually, too, it is a pleasure to watch. The excellent costuming, hair, and makeup (Case Study A: Greta), as well as vintage props and set design make the series an immersive piece of historical fiction.
“A League of Their Own”’s dialogue — while not blatantly contemporary — does feel more modernized than other 1940s-era media. But while the occasional cussing and 21st century phrases may be received as inappropriate for the show’s time period, the truth is that this stylistic choice works well and feels rather natural. In fact, while period media can often feel too distant to be relevant and accessible for modern audiences, “A League of Their Own”’s writers succeed in creating a compelling viewing experience for all.
The real star of the series, however, is its nuanced and thoughtful storytelling.
The show itself is rather like a peach — fruity and quite sweet. As writer and co-creator Abbi Jacobson said, the original movie “is an iconic queer film, but no one in the film is openly gay and it's not really that clear.” And as it turns out, this conception is very much rooted in historical reality. Maybelle Blair, an actual AAGPBL player who served as a consultant for the show came out as gay at the age of 95 during the show’s press tour and shared about queer life in the League: “Out of 650 [women], I bet you 400 was gay.” The series, then, focuses not only on a team of women fighting to play the sport that they love within a context of misogyny, but also illuminates many of the characters’ particular struggles as queer women amidst rampant homophobia.
The show is thorough in its portrayal of the stigmatization of the BGLTQ community — and this is critical, of course — but, perhaps more importantly, it creates vital space to explore sources of queer joy. Carson, for instance, is able to share a transformative love and relationship with Greta, find a strong (albeit previously invisible to her) community of queer people within Rockford and the League and grow into a renewed sense of identity and self. Max, similarly, explores a new romantic connection with would-be teammate Esther, experiences unconditional friendship with iconic best friend Clance (a true highlight of the series), and reconnects with her previously estranged uncle Bertie — who becomes a source of gentle guidance and support as Max finds her footing within the Black queer community.
It’s no secret that popular media has frequently struggled to provide BGLTQ representation in media at all, let alone queer representation that is not steeped in tragedy and pain. This series, in contrast, delivers on every front: providing a variety of lovable, real queer characters as well as an uninhibited exploration of both their challenges and triumphs. This being said, it is not surprising to learn that the show’s creators — Abbi Jacobson and Will Graham — are both queer.
The story’s exploration of the complexity of queer identity does not stop there, as all of the show’s queer characters do not share the same monolithic experiences. In contrast to the all-white original film, the 2022 “A League of Their Own” series features both Latinx and Black characters in the main cast and explicitly acknowledges the ways in which their racial-ethnic identities influence their experiences as athletes and/or queer women, compared to their white counterparts.
Even from the first episode, for instance, Max’s pro-pitching aspirations are immediately thwarted when she is barred from trying out for the League due to being Black. From that point on, Max and Carson’s stories run parallel to each other: A structural choice that emphasizes the effect that race has on the life outcomes of — and opportunities available to — otherwise extremely similar characters. And while Carson and Max’s paths cross on several occasions, it is also important to note that Max’s storyline is allowed to unfold independently without solely being utilized to further Carson’s character arc.
With recent queer shows like “The Wilds,” “Paper Girls,” and “First Kill” experiencing cancellation by their respective platforms, it is unsurprising that many are concerned for the future of “A League of Their Own.” This is especially true given the review-bombing the show experienced immediately after its release, before fans banded together to outnumber the trolls. This being said, it would be a true loss and disappointment if the series is not allowed to continue what it began, as the bases are loaded for more seasons to follow. It beckons, for instance, for a natural transition into focusing on the next baseball season, a delving into of the personal histories of various supporting characters, and — of course — a continuation of the beloved “Gretson” relationship (also revealing what was in that dang letter that Greta left for Carson!).
Well-made, entertaining, multi-dimensional, funny, inclusive — “A League of Their Own” leaves little to be desired. It is at once pragmatic, but hopeful: Marred by heavy undertones, yet still light and inspiring. It is obvious that the series is suffused with a tremendous amount of research, thought, and — above all – heart, and even with the towering expectations set by the immortal original film, “A League of Their Own” is a home run by any standard.

“Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es.” Tell me what you eat, I’ll tell you what you are.
This line appears in French lawyer Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 treatise “Physiology of Taste,” a foundational text for the field of gastronomy. With time, the aphorism evolved into the more familiar “you are what you eat.”
As a vegan, the opposite rings truer for me — I am what I don’t eat. That is, I am known for what I don’t eat. And because of this, while I was at Harvard, I was the inevitable recipient of all of my friends’ grievances against HUDS vegan food.
The greatest offender by far was the vegan cheese. Wherever this faux dairy solid appeared — kale-and-potato enchiladas, seitan cheesesteak subs, balsamic-glazed pizza — outrage followed. I’ve heard so many opinions on HUDS vegan cheese, almost all ferociously negative: “Why is the vegan cheese so gross?” “This pizza was perfectly fine until they put vegan cheese on it.” “Why can’t they just use real cheese?”
Sometimes, it got personal — “It’s your fault they started putting vegan cheese on everything!”
That isn’t true, though. I was not the only HUDS diner who didn’t eat dairy. A poll conducted last year by students in the “Animals and Politics” Expos section reported that, of 129 students surveyed, 6 percent followed a vegan diet. If we apply that rate to Harvard’s 7,095 current undergraduates, we get roughly 426 total vegans. So, at most, the responsibility is 1/426 mine. Nevertheless, among my friends, I endured the bitter whining alone.
This culinary intolerance exists far beyond college dining halls. On Aug. 1, Southern-style comfort-food chain Cracker Barrel announced on Facebook that, for the first time ever, it would include plant-based meat on its all-day breakfast menu. Outrage ensued. Hundreds of commenters lambasted the restaurant for the “new meat frontiers” it advertised.
Notably, this new option did not take the place of any existing meat choice — these people were  outraged that a vegetarian meat substitute would be featured on the menu at all. As you “Build Your Own Homestyle Breakfast,” you still have the choice of bacon, smoked sausage, country ham, grilled chicken tenders, hamburger steak, spicy chicken sausage, country fried steak, Sunday homestyle chicken, sirloin steak, sugar ham, or country ham. What amazing abundance — more than ten breakfast meats to choose from, all day, every day, as part of a full breakfast that can come in at less than $10. Impossible Sausage merely joins the ranks.
I’m from Nashville, Tennessee, a stone’s throw from the first Cracker Barrel restaurant, which opened in 1969, a time when plant-based Southern comfort food would have been an oxymoron. In this sense, Cracker Barrel’s pro-veggie menu expansion is a weighty sign of the times.
The Cracker Barrel hullabaloo and my friends’ determined animosity toward vegan cheese  exemplify an attitude I’ve observed throughout my two years of being vegan: All too often, non-vegans are hostile towards the inclusion of vegan alternative foods.
To these militant animal-product purists, I say: Forgive me, I’m vegan. I couldn’t help but give up meat — I studied Earth Science and love this planet! I began college as a standard-issue omnivore, but during the summer after my sophomore year, a research project led me to quit eating animal products cold turkey. Actually, it was chicken — Trader Joe’s mini chicken tacos were my meaty Last Supper.
That summer, I learned that livestock contribute 14.5 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions globally, and that cows are especially egregious global-warming offenders, producing — or, more specifically, burping — copious amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. What we eat, I realized, can decide what our planet will become.
And right now, it’s getting hot in here. In a world where massive corporations and governments make most major choices surrounding emissions of rich countries, eating a plant-forward diet is one of the most impactful choices the individual consumer can make to vote with their dollars for a cooler planet.
I won’t lie to defend the gustatory merit of vegan cheese. Frankly, I think it’s kind of gross. It’s ooey-gooey-gummy in all the wrong ways. The texture’s off, the flavor’s off, but I cannot deny that I look forward to its appearances on the dining hall menu. I miss the flavor of real cheese, and vegan cheese hits the spot despite all its flaws.
As this new semester begins, please skip the vegan cheese hate speech. Your non-dairy friends have heard it all before. If you don’t like it, just don’t eat it. And if you’re non-dairy-curious, give it a try. You might even enjoy it.

The best days were those when I got delivery notifications from UPS and Winthrop at the same time. I would hop into the elevator, trotting down the hallway past the Building Manager’s office like a happy child on Christmas morning. As I rummaged through the cubbies and bins, searching for my n-th order of the semester, it seemed like the dozens of Prime packages were smiling in anticipation along with me.
Online shopping is fun. There’s no denying the anticipation of waiting for a package to arrive. When you’re at college, away from home, and without a car, online shopping becomes a necessity. When you forget to pack for the cold weather or need an outfit for a themed event in three days, “Add to Cart” will always come to the rescue.
But after the initial dopamine boost from the retail therapy wore off, the packaging and bubble mailers taunted me from the recycling bin. A nagging reminder of my overconsumption, a gentle nudge that sent me down the thought spiral of questioning: Did I really need that?
The fashion industry is responsible for 10 percent of carbon emissions annually, making it one of the largest polluters on the planet. But it seemed to me like being an environmentalist meant owning very few of the right things: a capsule wardrobe, reusable products made from organic and recycled materials, neutral-colored everything — the complete opposite of what I gravitate towards as a past Miss New York. Surely, there had to be a way to be Earth-conscious without limiting my wardrobe to basics and earth tones, with no room for fun and flexibility. So there began my search for sustainable fashion and shopping habits.
Reformation likes to say “Being naked is the #1 most sustainable option. We’re #2.” Wrong. The most sustainable option (after being naked) is simply wearing what you own. Whether it’s from fast fashion giants like Shein, leaders in sustainability like Patagonia, or your roommate’s made-to-order crochet shop, wearing the pieces you own emits no extra carbon into the atmosphere.
Another S-tier option is borrowing clothing or buying secondhand. Similarly to wearing what’s in your wardrobe, nothing new is created, meaning no carbon emissions from the manufacturing process. Phone a friend the next time you need an outfit on short notice, especially if you only plan on wearing it once.
There’s always the option of buying pre-loved clothes from local thrift stores or more upscale curators, like The Garment District. Personally, I’ve had better success online. Between Depop, thredUP, Swap, Thrifted, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace (which I’ve heard is good for furniture?), and a billion others, there are countless opportunities to shop secondhand.
Besides, there’s always the Senior Sale at the end of the year.
Ideally, every brand would sell ethically and sustainably made clothing for a price that everyone can afford. But it’s no secret that some brands are more ethical than others and that many sustainable companies brandish high prices and limited size ranges.
If you can buy from a sustainable brand, go ahead, but realistically, most of us can’t afford to spend $100+ per piece every time we shop. This doesn’t mean we can’t do anything.
Sustainability is a sliding scale.
Literally: Good On You rates clothing brands on their environmentally-friendly practices, or lack thereof, on a scale from “We Avoid” (Fabletics, Fashion Nova) to “Great” (ARMEDANGELS, MATE the Label). Several mainstream brands hover around “It’s a Start”, like Dickies, Nike, and Levi’s. We should all aim for a more sustainable brand than where we’ve bought from in the past.
No matter where you buy, how you buy still makes a difference. Shopping online can be more environmentally friendly than shopping in-store — but only if you do it correctly.
It starts with making the decision to shop either online or in-store. By doing both, you put both your personal vehicle and a delivery truck on the road when you could’ve just had one. If you know Staples doesn’t carry your favorite pen, order it online with the rest of your stationery, ideally in one package. Head to CVS in the Square if you’re in need of quick snacks or batteries for your LEDs instead of buying one online and the other in-store.
Next, go with standard shipping whenever possible. Although tempting, selecting next-day or other express shipping options increases carbon emissions by forcing package carriers to deliver on a half-empty truck. For the dedicated Amazon Primers, try making less frequent orders and combining packages when possible —  it makes for an easier trip to the mailroom anyway. And if you really want a gold star, you can pick up your packages from the nearest Amazon Locker (there’s one in Central — get yourself some bubble tea at the same time as a reward).
The great thing about these guidelines is that they can be applied to any online purchase, no matter the brand.
Creating a more sustainable world means making changes that are sustainable for you. No one has to do everything, but everyone has to do something. Take the time to buy pieces you’ll wear and care for the clothes you already own. If a beauty queen can be a proud outfit repeater, I have faith that you can too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For hundreds of years, human remains of likely enslaved people were locked away in museum collections at Harvard, extending the cruelty of unfreedom that these individuals — both named and unnamed — experienced during life to a loss of bodily autonomy after death. Now, following the release of the Report of the Steering Committee on Human Remains in University Museum Collections, these remains are finally set to return to the hands of their descendants.
This headline outcome, along with the University’s move to create a Human Remains Research Review Committee and a Human Remains Returns Committee to implement the report’s recommendations, are welcome steps in the University’s work to address its role in slavery and colonialism. However, given the magnitude of harm inflicted by the University’s past actions — some of the bodies were used explicitly to support the racist pseudoscience that had informed their oppression — the report as it currently stands is painfully inadequate.
Take, for example, the University’s approach to memorializing the people whose bodies were misappropriated. The published report recognizes the necessity of this first reparational step, but it puts an undue burden on “affinity groups” with a connection to the identity of the individual. These wrongs were committed by the University; the burden is on the University to come up with a plan that is more specific than broadly seeking community feedback and fairer than disproportionately burdening communities of color it has wronged in the past. We urge the committees in creation to rethink the solutions outlined in this initial report and use their extensive expertise to draft something wiser and more specific in its recommendations.
Amid the bureaucratic morass of committee creations and open-ended recommendations, the theme that comes across most clearly in the report is that of a Harvard ill-equipped to wrestle with racist elements of history and broadly reluctant to take accountability for the trauma it has caused. When University President Lawrence S. Bacow emailed the community on the report’s findings, he made it a point to mention Harvard’s “efforts to care for one of the largest collections of Native American ancestors in the country and to address our entanglements with slavery.” At best, this language is tastelessly self-congratulatory. At worst, it gravely understates and misrepresents the severity of Harvard’s past actions.
We might be more inclined to take the report as a good-faith first step — and not a performative gesture — if Harvard were not, at this moment, actively resisting efforts by Tamara K. Lanier to sue for emotional distress inflicted by the University’s possession of photos of an enslaved person she claims as her direct ancestors.
This case reminds us that human remains constitute just a particularly acute subset of the problematic holdings of Western museums. Many of the items currently in Harvard’s collections were collected before more recent restrictions on the ethical acquisition of artifacts, and Harvard should include careful examination of prior acquisitions in its efforts to correct past misdeeds.
More broadly, however, Harvard’s return of these remains does not mark the end of the University’s role in slavery and settler colonialism; the epistemic damage of research conducted in this vein will persist long after the material remains leave campus. Harvard needs a permanent place to reckon with its role in some of the cruelest parts of human history. The University must make any records of academic work connected to these remains, including the procedure of storage itself, publicly available — perhaps, as we have previously opined, in the form of a “museum of institutional failings” — so that the institution’s contributions to epistemologies of slavery and settler colonialism are not swept under the rug or forgotten.
Even as Harvard takes comprehensive steps to purge its collections of misappropriated remains, it should be clear that much work remains. This report’s release does not mark the end of the University’s role in reckoning with slavery and settler colonialism. It does not negate the years of harm done to so many individuals and vulnerable groups. The epistemic scars of race science — built, in part, on the pseudoscientific analysis of remains in Harvard’s collections — remain. Harvard’s task is just beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donning rainbow colors, a group of LGBTQ+ undergraduates attended a Harvard College Faith and Action event last Friday to counter a message portrayed by the speaker that many of them deemed homophobic.
Titled “What is the Good News for my LGBTQ+ Neighbors?”, HCFA’s worship event featured Tyler S. Parker ’17, a minister for the group who discussed his theological decision to remain celibate as someone attracted to people of the same sex. In dissent, more than 20 students attended the event and hosted a panel afterward to highlight LGBTQ+ experiences diverging from Parker’s.
Abby D. McElroy ’24, who helped to organize the panel held after the event, said it was important to show there are spaces that fully support LGBTQ+ Christians.
“This event is claiming to say this is the Christian good news. But actually, there’s so much Christian good news that fully affirms and so many Christian traditions that fully affirm and love queer people and queer identities and queer love,” McElroy said. “We want to make sure that people know that, actually, a majority of Christians hold a very different view.”
In a statement to The Crimson, HCFA co-presidents Katherine Wang ’23 and Felix D. Perez Diener ’23 wrote that HCFA aims to “be a place where any student can become a follower of Jesus.”
“We’re not perfect, but we’re trying hard to love others the way Jesus commands us in John 15:12-13: ‘Love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends,’” they wrote.
Elizabeth S. Propst ’23, another panel organizer, said the LGBTQ+ students’ display was meant to be “loving and compassionate” but also “dissenting.”
“We organized it with the intention not to be aggressive about disrupting their event, but to let them know that we are part of this campus,” Propst said. “Their actions have impacts on people and communities that can cause a lot of pain to people that maybe they are not interacting with on a regular basis.”
HCFA has been no stranger to controversy over the years.
In 2018, the group drew protest for hosting an event with Jackie Hill-Perry, an outspoken critic of homosexuality. HCFA was put on probation by the College less than a week later after pushing out a leader who was in a same-sex relationship.
Sarika Chawla ’23, who earlier this month denounced HCFA over a Lowell House email list, criticized the group for “tokenizing” its speaker at Friday’s event.
“This is a homophobic theology that HCFA is pushing,” Chawla said. “That [Parker] was told, essentially, in order to be gay, he must be single forever and not act on his queerness was particularly heartbreaking.”
In a statement to The Crimson, Parker wrote that he “was careful to only encourage students to use Scripture to discern what Jesus might call them to embrace.”
“One thing I did say was that as a single and celibate queer Christian, I’m invited to explore all the ways to cultivate intimacy and chosen family with other humans beyond the norms of sex, romance, and marriage,” Parker wrote. “Queer authors have been urging queer folks to broaden their horizons for intimacy and family for decades, and I just translated that message for a Christian audience.”
“If platforming queer ideas is ‘homophobic,’ I have a different definition of the word,” he added.
Parker also wrote that being labeled as a “token” is an example of the way the “queer community often fails black folks in its use of racialized language.”
Following the HCFA worship service, students hosted a panel featuring four speakers who identify as LGBTQ+ and Christian.
“It was really important to us to lift up voices of — in this case — Christian folks who fully affirm queerness and religion, and specifically the intersections of queerness and Christianity,” McElroy said. “It was a community space for folks to reflect together, and we really wanted to cultivate a space that would uplift the joyful intersections.”
Still, some attendees have called for the College to place HCFA on probation once again for spreading a message they believe is at odds with the ideals of an inclusive campus.
“The thing that I think HCFA should face sanctions for is the fact that it’s not a welcoming organization to queer people,” Kate H. Travis ’22 said. “There’s a scenario in which I might have been a part of HCFA if I had been welcomed into that community.”
Perez Diener and Wang wrote that sanctioning HCFA would be detrimental to freedom of religion at Harvard.
“We would be forced to deny what we believe the Bible says about sexuality in order to avoid probation — a chilling precedent for freedom of religion and thought at Harvard,” they wrote.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the possibility of sanctions from the Dean of Students Office in light of recent criticisms against HCFA.
While Brit G. Shrader ’24 disagreed with HCFA’s messaging, they said spaces for LGBTQ+ Christian students — beyond HCFA — exist on campus.
“Your love is beautiful. It’s precious. And there are spaces on campus that aren’t HCFA and off campus that are completely queer and Christian,” Schrader said. “There’s so many affirming, Christian spaces for queer folks — they’re on campus, and there’s space for you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After soliciting votes for their first-ever referendum earlier this week, the Harvard Undergraduate Association announced Thursday that the results would be declared void, citing a constitutional misunderstanding with the Dean of Students Office.
HUA Co-President LyLena D. Estabine ’24 wrote in Slack communications over the HUA channel that the referendum was void because the Association had not yet appointed a student election commission, and constitutional amendments would not be considered again until the spring. The decision drew ire from some students, who saw another delay in an ongoing effort to establish a diversity, equity, and inclusion team within the HUA.
“Our conversations with the DSO left us with the impression that until an election commission was convened, their staff could serve in that capacity,” Estabine wrote. “Upon further review, we have decided, in consultation with the DSO, that the HUA must be a student-led organization, including the election commission.”
The debacle began on Monday, when Primus, a campus group representing first-generation, low-income students at the College, went public on Instagram with claims that the HUA had dismissed its efforts to establish a DEI team over the summer.
The addition of a new team requires the passage of a school-wide constitutional reform referendum — a process that, according to the HUA’s constitution, can be initiated by a unanimous vote of the executive board or a petition signed by 5 percent of the student body.
Estabine and HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 refuted Primus’ accusations, saying they hesitated to hold a referendum in the fall, when an incoming DEI officer would only be eligible to serve for one semester.
Without agreement from HUA leaders, Primus pursued a referendum via petition, hosting a public town hall meeting Wednesday evening to discuss the matter with Estabine and Johnson. At that time, the referendum was still open, and Estabine encouraged attendees to vote in the minutes before it closed.
But during the meeting, both Primus and HUA leadership claimed to have received different information from the DSO about the referendum, creating confusion surrounding the state of the election commission.
“In terms of what is a fact, the election commissioner is JR [Bagley] at the DSO, and we are working with him to ensure that the election is handled fairly and smoothly,” Estabine said during the town hall.
Laila A. Nasher ’25, the vice president of advocacy for Primus, said she had received conflicting information from her conversations regarding Primus’ petition for the establishment of a DEI team.
“The DSO said that there is an election commissioner who held [Tuesday’s] referendum and that this was not the HUA’s executive team. They said that you guys should definitely name a commissioner to hold the election,” Nasher said. “So I’m just confused about this gap of information.”
Estabine, Johnson, and Nasher did not come to a resolution by the meeting’s conclusion. DSO representative Jason R. Meier did not respond to a request for comment.
On Thursday, when Primus submitted its petition to the DSO for certification, they were told that the process should instead be handled by the HUA, according to an email from Meier to Primus.
In the email, which was obtained by The Crimson, Meier said the office could not initiate the referendum process as it would be an “administrative over-reach.”
In the wake of the Undergraduate Council’s dissolution last spring, the DSO appointed an interim election commission to facilitate the election of the HUA’s first officers, as outlined by the Association’s constitution.
According to Estabine and Johnson, an official election commission will be formed by the end of September through applications selected by the executive board.
In her Thursday statement, Estabine confirmed that a question regarding the formation of an “Inclusion Team” would appear on the HUA’s spring referendum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After at least three failed attempts over more than six years, the Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union has successfully voted to merge with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
In mid-August, HUSPMGU voted and ratified the Inclusion Agreement, which brings the approximately 80-member union under the umbrella of HUCTW. When the merger takes effect on Oct. 1, it will give HUSPMGU members “parity on pay and phased-in coverage under HUCTW benefits, policies, and protections,” per a Sep. 8 email to HUCTW members.
The agreement features four annual pay raises that will increase hourly wages by a total of $4.75 — a 27 percent increase from the current minimum wage. The first raise, which will up rates by 2 dollars per hour, will be retroactive to Oct. 1, 2021.
The merger will also provide new job security protections and one additional week of vacation time per year for all members with fewer than 10 years of service.
“We’re thrilled with where things are right now and where they’re heading next,” said Danielle R. Boudrow, HUCTW recording secretary. “We’re so, so happy to have finally reached an agreement with the University.”
HUSPMGU has been striving to become a part of HUCTW, a larger union with roughly 5,000 members, for more than half a decade.
Boudrow said the breakthrough in negotiations came over the summer with the help of an independent mediator “who was very skillful and helpful” in coordinating an agreement between the two unions and the University.
She noted that the comparative size of HUSPMGU relative to HUCTW was a driving factor in the push for the merger. Boudrow said the merger will allow HUSPMGU members to benefit from HUCTW’s “professional” and “full-time staff.”
“Being such a small union has its limitations in terms of how much power you can exert when you’re in conflict with the University,” Boudrow said. “Being part of a bigger union means they’re part of a much bigger and much more powerful group of people.”
Curt E. Rheault, president of HUSPMGU, also said the merger will afford new opportunities to museum, parking, and security workers due to HUTCW’s larger, union-dedicated staff.
“Now, we’re professionally run instead of a bunch of amateurs running around doing the best they can,” he said.
“If our members are diligent and want to self improve and get a better chance in life and change their trajectory on what their careers look like, they have a lot better shot at doing it,” Rheault added.
Beyond the contract-related benefits of the new deal, Boudrow said the merger will improve “economic justice” among Harvard’s staff.
“HUSPMGU members have been the lowest paid at the University by a lot, and they’re getting a really significant boost in this deal that we’re super excited about that brings them much more in line with other union members at the University and with other HUCTW members,” she said.
“It’s a nice end of an era where the University had this underpaid group, and now they’re gonna have to pay them much more fairly and we’re very excited about it,” Boudrow added.
Rheault expressed optimism that the merger will benefit both union members and the University.
“I’m really hoping it works out for the better of both the union and Harvard that we’re together now, and we can go forward and make it a better work environment — better for Harvard, better for everybody,” he said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton did not respond to a request for comment on the merger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard celebrated the launch of the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence on Thursday in an event featuring remarks from Meta CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg.
Announced in December 2021 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the Kempner Institute seeks to better understand the intersection between natural and artificial intelligence, two fields that are “intimately connected,” according to the institute’s website.
Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07 have pledged $500 million dollars toward the establishment of the institute over the next 15 years. The fund will support new faculty members, computing infrastructure, and resources for students to interact between different labs in the institute.
The namesake of the institute are Zuckerberg’s mother, Karen Kempner Zuckerberg, and grandparents, Sidney and Gertrude Kempner.
“My parents and grandparents focused on the power of the mind and intelligence to try to improve the world,” Zuckerberg said Thursday. “We thought that it was fitting that this institute will bear the Kempner name, because we hope that it will fuel discoveries about the mind and intelligence that will bring good to the world for generations to come.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow lauded Zuckerberg and Chan for their knowledge of artificial intelligence and their philanthropic efforts toward education.
“Mark and Priscilla are quite unique because they are among the very, very few philanthropic donors in the world who actually have every bit as much subject matter expertise — if not more — than the people that they are going to be supporting here,” Bacow said. “They have given us this incredible opportunity for which we're enormously grateful.”
According to Chan, the institute will drive progress by following a three-pronged approach focusing on research, computation, and education. On the research front, Kempner will study the underlying principles of artificial intelligence and neurobiology and uncover new ideas and problems. The institute will also use advanced computing to generate and analyze data at a “truly massive scale,” Chan said.
“It will also put this technology directly into the hands of students,” she added. “They'll be the first generation in history to use machine learning tools so early in their careers.”
Both Zuckerberg and Chan emphasized the importance of placing students and young minds at the forefront of the Kempner Institute. Zuckerberg described students as “flexible thinkers” and “acutely aware” of the problems that need to be solved.
“Kempner was set up as a big bet on the students,” Zuckerberg said. “There's a lot of different ways to do this stuff in academia, but we believe students are really the ones who are going to solve the big problems here.”
The launch event also featured video remarks from several tech giants including Bill Gates ’77, former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt, and CEO of Amazon Andy Jassy ’90. Gates, Schmidt, and Jassey lauded Harvard for investing in the future of AI through the Kempner Institute.
“I am absolutely confident that in 10 to 20 years, this institute will have produced some of the greatest minds in AI,” said Schmidt.

In November 2017, Drew G. Faust, Harvard University’s carefully-spoken president, offered a dire warning: A Republican tax proposal that was pending in the U.S. House, she said, would be “a blow at the strength of American higher education.”
The bill, which was signed into law later that year, included a provision that required dozens of schools — including Harvard and four other Ivy League schools at the time — to pay taxes on their multi-billion dollar endowments, a requirement they had dodged for years.
Universities had spent millions of dollars lobbying to kill proposals that would require them to pay taxes on their investment earnings. But with a changing political tide in Washington, they were unable to fend off the 2017 tax bill, which imposed a 1.4 percent excise tax on investment returns for private colleges and universities whose endowments exceed $500,000 per student.
Supporters say the legislation makes rich universities pay their fair share. But higher education leaders insist it has placed an undue burden on institutions that exist to promote the public good.
“Taxing charitable resources away from higher education institutions does not make them more affordable — it has exactly the opposite effect,” Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow said in May, a week after a lobbying trip to Washington. “It makes for bad public policy.”
The tax is a drop in the bucket for Harvard’s $53.2 billion endowment. The University’s annual financial report for fiscal year 2019 estimated it would have to pay an additional $37.7 million in federal taxes due to the provision.
Some worry the legislation is more about making a political statement than it is fiscal policy — and that it could turn elite schools into more of a partisan punching bag than they already are.
Thomas D. Parker ’64, an expert on higher education and nonprofit management, said concerns with the bill extend well beyond tax policy.
“This is about Republican enmity toward what they believe are hotbeds of progressive activism,” he said.
Harvard has argued the excise tax is a blow to initiatives like financial aid that promote student welfare.
Harvard’s endowment is a complex aggregate of thousands of different funds — approximately 80 percent of which individual donors have earmarked for specific uses. The excise tax passed in 2017 requires endowments to hand over a small portion of each fund’s investment returns to the federal government. As a result, Harvard says, the tax reduces its capacity to invest in important initiatives.
Higher education experts say lawmakers fail to recognize the reality of how university endowments operate.
“They just think that you have these wealthy institutions that have this enormous pile of money, and they think of them like a savings account,” said Steven M. Bloom, assistant vice president for government relations at the American Council on Education. “They aren’t, and the complexity of it, I think, escapes people.”
Like many private universities, Harvard hires external investment firms to oversee the vast majority of its endowment funds, meaning the University does not have direct access to most of its assets. Each year, the endowment disperses a small fraction of its value — usually around 5 percent — for University operations.
Even for the portion of their endowments that universities can spend on a discretionary basis, there are better uses for the money than sending it to Washington, said former Vassar College President Catharine B. Hill.
“When institutions have to pay this tax, it means they have that much less money to spend on other priorities or other objectives,” she said. “To the extent that it’s spread across the institution, it’ll affect different spending lines in a budget.”
Far from “rainy day funds,” endowments are designed to be investment tools that plan years into the future, said Liz Clark, vice president for policy and research for the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
“Endowments are unique in that they are created to provide reliable and growing funds over time,” she said. “It’s a hard concept because a lot of people see these large pools of funds and think that they should all go to the here and now.”
But some experts say Harvard still has wide latitude over where cuts to pay for the tax could come from.
“It’s only keeping the university from spending on scholarships if the university decides that it’s going to take that money out of scholarship,” Vanderbilt Law School professor emeritus Beverly I. Moran said. “The university could take the money out of something else. That’s what a budget is.”
Charlie Eaton, a sociology professor at the University of California, Merced, said Harvard needs to do more to promote the interests of low-income students in order to argue the tax significantly burdens its ability to support student welfare.
“Harvard enrolls so many fewer students than schools with a fraction of its resources,” he said. “If Harvard really wanted to make the case that equity is compromised by the endowment tax, it would just have to enroll a lot more students from disadvantaged backgrounds than it currently enrolls.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment for this story.
But the debate over the endowment tax is not just about fiscal policy.
Elite schools and their endowments have increasingly become political targets for Republican lawmakers — Harvard especially. In June, Fox News host Pete Hegseth mockingly scribbled “RETURN TO SENDER” on his Harvard Kennedy School degree, saying it should be named “Critical Theory University.”
Lawmakers have also taken aim at Harvard. In June, Senator Marco A. Rubio (R-Fla.) alleged without direct evidence that Harvard officials may have played a part in suppressing theories about the genesis of Covid-19. Later that month, U.S. Representative Gregory F. Murphy (R-N.C.) called on the school to disclose and divest its endowment from any potential holdings in Chinese companies.
Many higher education experts say the tax reflects discontent with a perceived liberal bent at elite universities — rather than economic motivations. An endowment tax, after all, is not cut out from traditional supply-side economic policy, which prioritizes reducing taxes for the wealthy.
“Republican tax policy encourages wealth. Republicans want to cut taxes for wealthy individuals and corporations,” Parker said. “So this completely violates traditional Republican tax law.”
Sandy Baum, a nonresident senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said there are merits to legislators’ criticisms of rising tuition costs. But political motivations are at play, too, she said.
“It does seem like this whole narrative of, ‘We don’t like these institutions, and we want to stop them from doing whatever they want to do because we see them as left-wing,’” she said.
But the endowment tax isn’t just red meat for the GOP base. Some Democrats have backed similar proposals in recent years — including Massachusetts’ 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Jay Gonzalez, who campaigned in Harvard Square on a plan that would cost the University more than $500 million.
“We live in a time that I think is a populist era, and you’re seeing attacks against institutions that are perceived as the establishment,” Bloom said. “So it’s not surprising that these affluent institutions and their endowments are subject to attack — it’s sort of a cheap political ploy.”
It’s that sentiment that concerns some higher education experts, who fret that more taxes could be on the horizon.
“What they’re afraid of is that it’s the camel’s nose under the tent — that this thing could get out of control,” Moran said, “and at some point universities might be subject to the taxes that other companies are subject to.”
Since the passage of the 2017 bill, Harvard has helped lead the charge to repeal the endowment tax.
This summer, the University lobbied Congressional Democrats to roll back the tax as part of a budget reconciliation bill that was signed into law in August.
But the final bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, didn’t touch the endowment tax, and schools may face long odds going forward in their effort to get rid of the policy.
“Harvard faces two problems: It faces Republicans who don’t like elite universities in general and Democrats who think that it’s perfectly OK to tax the rich a little more,” Parker said. “So from a lobbying point of view, this is a substantial difficulty.”
But GOP lawmakers may face headwinds of their own if they try to expand the tax the way some universities fear, Moran said.
“You can say the right hates universities — but the right likes Wall Street, and these endowments are very important for Wall Street,” she said. “These hedge funds make a very nice living off of these endowments.”
Several lawmakers have proposed legislation that would repeal or reform the excise tax. The Higher Education Endowment Tax Reform Act, introduced by Rep. Brendan F. Boyle (D-Pa.), would repeal the excise tax for universities that meet a threshold for spending on financial aid. But the discussion is likely dead in the water until after the November midterm elections.
“It’s not a good look to push through a tax cut for Harvard at the same time that you’re going into an election,” Eaton said.
Still, lobbying efforts are likely to continue.
“Issues are never moot in Washington,” Clark said. “All of the institutions that are impacted by this tax here and now — or potentially impacted by it in the foreseeable future — have an interest in talking to policymakers about what it means for their institution.”
No matter whether the tax is repealed or reformed in the near future, Harvard still has a responsibility to continue pursuing the charitable acts that exempt it from most government taxes in the first place, some experts maintain.
Tax requirements aside, Moran said Harvard still has a responsibility to invest in programs like financial aid, which exempt it from most federal taxes in the first place.
“Scholarships aren’t breaking Harvard’s back. It’s a very typical argument that wealthy people make,” Moran said. “‘Oh you’re taking my money in taxes — now I can’t give to charity.’”
“Everybody else pays taxes and gives to charity,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen seniors were announced Thursday as senior class marshals for the Class of 2023.
The marshals, who together comprise the Senior Class Committee, are responsible for organizing class-wide events until Commencement in May. The committee also coordinates the Senior Gift fund and plans post-graduation reunions.
After two rounds of elections, Athena Q. Ye ’23 and Chibuike K. “Chibby” Uwakwe ’23 were named First and Second Marshals, respectively.
Ye, who received the news of her selection at swim practice, wrote in a statement that she was “extremely grateful and blessed for this opportunity.”
“Not only did I feel thankful for the people who voted for me during the election, but I also felt so supported by those I’ve formed connections with these past 3 years,” Ye wrote. “The people of Harvard is what makes this place special. I can’t wait to do them proud.”
Uwakwe, a Crimson Arts editor, said he is excited to “make up for lost time” for students in the Class of 2023 — the only cohort the University did not invite back to campus when classes went online in the 2020-2021 academic year.
“This role isn’t just for senior week, it’s not just for when we graduate, it’s definitely long term. And I’m really excited to function in this role and work with Athena and also work with the Alumni Association to have super great reunions,” Uwakwe said. “These reunions are really important for us to build a class identity.”
Program Marshals, who place third through eighth in the election process, are tasked with organizing class and alumni activities.
“Being able to take a moment and help celebrate our class, and just making sure that all of our unique experiences can contribute to Harvard’s future — it's just really amazing,” said Esther J. Xiang ’23, a program marshal.
In addition to the eight elected marshals, six seniors, appointed as Gift Marshals by the Harvard College Fund, are responsible for the Senior Gift Campaign.
“The hope is that each senior will make a small contribution to the Senior Gift Campaign, which essentially goes to the Harvard College Fund and is used for various projects across the college from funding Brain Breaks to helping with financial aid,” said Mustafa Ansari ’23, one of six gift marshals.
Jonathan Z. Zhang ’23 said his role as gift marshal entails working with the Harvard College Fund to encourage members of the Class of 2023 to begin a “culture of giving back.”
Natalka A. Bowley ’23 said she most looks forward to interacting with members of Class of 2023 through her role as gift marshal.
“Being a class marshal — or being a gift marshal, or being on the Class Committee in general — means that you really get a chance to talk to people about their lives and really stay in touch after you graduate in a way that I’m really lucky to be able to experience,” Bowley said.
In the coming weeks, the class marshals will interview candidates to make up the remainder of the Senior Class Committee: the secretary, treasurer, media team, and house representatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government will graduate with a master’s degree in public policy or public administration. But first, they are struggling to master electing a new student government.
The Kennedy School’s student government race had all the makings of a real-world election: tension, apathy, frustration, and IT issues.
After the unveiling of the election roster, students learned that candidates were running uncontested in several positions — including for president — and unsuccessfully attempted to reopen candidate nominations. Then, two hours after polls opened, the election committee realized dozens of students were left in the dark about the election process because they were not added to an email list.
Imogen M. A. Hobby, interim HKS student government president and Bethany M. Kirkpatrick, interim vice president, announced in an email to the student body on Tuesday that they halted and dissolved the election due to an IT failure.
“We will modify this year’s election timeline and reopen the nominations process for this year’s fall election to all students,” they wrote. “This decision was made in consultation with the HKS administration.”
HKS spokesperson Sofiya C. Cabalquinto confirmed in a statement Wednesday that first-year master’s in public administration students did not receive emails about the election because of a Kennedy School IT error.
“We regret the error and have established fail-safes so that this does not happen again,” Cabalquinto wrote. “The election process is self-governed by KSSG, but we support their decision to pause and reopen elections next week to ensure all students can participate.”
Voting will run in the new election from Sept. 27 to Sept. 28. Candidate nominations opened on Tuesday and closed on Wednesday. Candidates who confirm their nominations will be allowed to start campaigning on Friday.
Jose G. Altamirano, a second-year master’s in public policy student, said the election suffered from the “perfect storm of circumstances and lack of general knowledge about election bylaws.”
Kirkpatrick said she received many inquiries as to whether “reopening nominations was possible or if starting a write-in candidacy was possible” after the ballot revealed only one candidate for student body president.
“But many things are prohibited by the bylaws, including the elections committee changing the bylaws,” said Kirkpatrick, who serves on the elections committee. “So as a result, we weren’t able to proceed with a lot of those things students were interested in.”
While the student government’s bylaws prevented new nominations, they did allow for a “none” option to be added on the ballot for uncontested positions, a function that was erroneously not used last year, according to Kirkpatrick.
“Students could vote for the candidate and really give those uncontested candidates a mandate or indicate that they did not wish for the candidate to serve, which was an option that the bylaws require,” Kirkpatrick said.
Omar M. Awad, a first-year mid-career MPA student, was the sole candidate running for president before the election’s suspension.
“The process humbled me and I tried to disattach [sic] myself from what people are saying and them attacking the uncontested candidate,” Awad said.
“I even did not contest this notion of a Droop quota when they added it,” Awad said, referring to the “none” candidate option. “Even though the bylaws doesn’t really say anything about uncontested positions.”
Alexander R. Cooper, a second-year MPA student, said he believed Hobby and Kirkpatrick were “responding to and taking cues” from Kennedy School administrators.
“That’s a pretty big red flag to me,” Cooper said. “I think the student government needs to exist separate from the administration, not as an arms to enforce the administration’s policies and their preferences.”
Hobby wrote in a statement Thursday evening that “it has always been standard practice for committees to consult with administrators in order to utilise their institutional memory of the election process.”
“Ultimately, Bethany and I made and took responsibility for all decisions, with careful reference to the bylaws, and there was never a situation where administrators told us what we were or were not allowed to do,” Hobby wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patrons looking to enter the Harvard Law School library Wednesday afternoon had to navigate around a dozen librarians and staff members, who crowded the front steps as they took turns reading aloud selections from their favorite banned books and authors.
The readout, which the Law School library has hosted since 2016, commemorates the 40th annual Banned Books Week — a nationwide campaign to fight censorship, spotlight persecuted individuals, and celebrate the freedom to read under the First Amendment’s free speech protections.
Featured works included Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Tim O’Brien’s “The Things They Carried,” Anne Frank’s “The Diary of a Young Girl,” Isaac Babel’s “Odessa Stories,” and Alison Bechdel’s “Fun Home.”
“It really was to help people understand that their ability to read whatever they want might be limited at some point in the future and how important it is for us in a place that celebrates intellectual freedom to champion access to books,” said HLS Library Executive Director Jocelyn B. Kennedy, who moderated the event.
Kennedy, who read excerpts from Toni Morrison's “The Bluest Eye,” George Orwell’s “1984,” and James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” said today’s most commonly challenged books discuss LGBTQ+ issues and racial justice, among other socially sensitive topics. She emphasized that having free access to books is crucial in generating difficult but necessary conversation and called attention to the rising censorship of books across the country.
“That's a human harm,” she said, “Why I think it's problematic is a person or a group of people are deciding on behalf of everybody what you can and cannot have access to — what you can and cannot hear or know.”
According to Kennedy, 2021 saw the challenging and banning of over 1,500 different books in the United States, a figure that has already been exceeded in 2022. A book is considered challenged when there is an attempt to remove or restrict it.
“It's getting worse,” Kennedy said. “There's something about the world that we're living in today that is leading people to challenge books more than ever before.”
The weeklong commemoration — spanning from Sept. 18 to 24 — was founded by the American Library Association following the 1982 Supreme Court case Island Trees School District v. Pico. High school senior Steven Pico and four peers challenged a New York school board’s decision to remove nine books, including Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” and Langston Hughes’s “Best Short Stories by Negro Writers,” from the district’s junior high and high school libraries.
“The reality is that it's been happening always,” Kennedy said. “We've always banned books. It's human nature to want to suppress anything that’s different.”
Lesliediana Jones, the HLS Library associate director for public services and chair of the American Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Committee, talked about the challenges librarians and educators face in supporting the free exchange of ideas that books provide.
Jones, who read a passage from Angie Thomas’ “The Hate U Give,” said librarians are “regularly being challenged, being threatened” and that some are “losing their job over books that are in their library — that are on the banned books list — and books that they want their students to read.”
“It has been for many of them a very traumatic experience, and many of them have left the profession,” she added.
In a video posted to Harvard’s social media accounts, Jones said, “Everyone has the right to read. That’s in the Constitution. We all have the right to read whatever we please.”

Considering that Harvard students signed a contract with the devil (academia) to spend every waking hour working, it is no surprise that they will do anything, especially listening to music, to make it more fun and/or efficient. Sometimes it feels like the audio is our only companion in the encroaching loneliness of Lamont. However, nothing we hold dear is safe from the Criticisms of Society, so we have decided to judge your listening choices and convict them of having certain ~vibes~.
