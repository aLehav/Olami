After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Graduate School of Design announced the 2013 winners of the 11th annual Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design, Portuguese architect Eduardo Souto de Moura added yet another triumph to his list. This year’s prize has been awarded to two winners: Souto de Moura, for his design of the metro in Porto, Portugal, and to the city of Medellín, Colombia for the Northeastern Urban Integration Project, a cost-effective transportation system that uses cable cars.
In celebration of the prize, Souto de Moura visited the Harvard Graduate School of Design to participate in a panel discussion with jury member Rahul Mehrotra, chair of the department of Urban Planning and Design at the GSD. Despite speaking through an interpreter, Souto de Moura maintained a rapt audience as he talked about the challenges and details of his projects.
In addition to sharing technical information, Souto de Moura casually joked about his fellow architects. When asked about Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the 20th-century German-American architect whose work Souto de Moura’s is most often compared to, he said, “It is a mystery to me how this man builds glass houses, but always lives in the dark. If I could write a thesis, it would try to answer that.” More seriously, he spoke of the influence of his mentor and collaborator Álvaro Siza Vieira. “We work together like two players of chess... [Siza] understands the site, its energy... his buildings are comfortable, like cats sleeping in the sun,” Souto de Moura said.
Souto de Moura’s work has recieved the 2013 Wolf Prize in Arts the prestigious architectural Pritzker Prize. Dan Borelli, Director of Exhibitions at the GSD, praises the scope of his work and the and the clean modern lines of the metro design. “It’s extremely challenging to sustain a design vision across so many scales, across such a vast network of design opportunities, materials, and collaborators, and I think he has done a fantastic job.” Borelli says.  He also notes the rapid and successful implementation of the project in a difficult hilly terrain.
Although this is an oft-echoed compliment, Souto de Moura brushes it off, insisting that work on infrastructure projects is not that far removed from work on single buildings. “The only difference is scale. It’s like being a pediatrician or being a doctor for adults—each patient has its own identity, but the attitude is the same,” he says.
According to James Whitten, Mehrotra’s assistant and last year a graduate of GSD’s Urban Design Masters Program, the prize was a win for students as well. Whitten says that the prize has a pedagogical function; both GSD students and members of the professional community can learn from the winning projects. “To me, what stood out was that they’re both thoroughly interdisciplinary works where designers have played a crucial role not only as the leader, but as the glue between a whole cadre of actors...from highly technical civil engineering right down to social workers and social planners,” Whitten says. He emphasizes that Souto de Moura’s work engages with the city’s rich historical background to produce a project that is well-designed but not flamboyant, allowing the focus to shift away from the project and back to the city and its existing architecture.
Whitten and Borelli both worked on “Transformative Mobilities,” the ongoing exhibition at the GSD documenting this year’s prize-winning projects. They say that there were some challenges in presenting two works from such vastly different settings in a cohesive exhibit. “We wanted each side to appear as different as possible; not severely, antagonistically different, but each side should speak with its own voice,” Borelli says.
Yet, Whitten also speaks of the need to place the two projects in a central framework and break down some of the binaries—developed vs. developing countries, Europe vs. South America—commonly emphasized when two cities such as Porto and Medellín are compared. A focus on mobility and the specific culture of each city provided this unifying frame.
As Whitten says, “Both share this relationship between planning and culture, leveraging new mobility infrastructures to repair and regenerate the urban fabric,” Whitten says. According to to Whitten, these projects are more than isolated constructions; rather, they will continue to give back to their urban areas over time. “It points to an intense investment in the space of the city,” he says.

R&B artists don’t usually point to the directors of “Halloween,” “The Fly,” and “Alien” as sources of musical inspiration for their debut albums. However, in a July interview with Complex, Abel Tesfaye, a.k.a. The Weeknd, did just that, explaining that his album debut, “Kiss Land,” was his attempt to “capture fear” as effectively as John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Ridley Scott did in their films. Unfortunately, the only fear “Kiss Land” actually inspires is that of listening to it more than once. On “Kiss Land,” melodic homogeneity, tasteless production, and an utter lack of artistic restraint combine to produce an album that isn’t merely boring, but downright aggravating.
What makes the failure of “Kiss Land” so disappointing is that it comes from a musician who put out 2011’s best record: the mixtape “House of Balloons.” When it was released, “Balloons” felt momentous, a genre-defying landmark of 21st century music. Tesfaye’s songwriting was menacing, yet alluring; complex, yet irresistibly memorable. The Weeknd released two more mixtapes in 2011, the decidedly darker “Thursday” and “Echoes of Silence.” Although not nearly as catchy as “Balloons,” these two records were still cohesive and well-crafted.
In the ensuing two years, almost everything has gone sour. To start, the heavy-handed production on “Kiss Land” feels completely out of sync with Tesfaye’s songs. The arena rock synths, soaring guitar, and slap bass that envelop “Love in the Sky” strip the song of any emotional depth, rendering it a turgid and forgettable exercise. The discordant synths that pummel the latter half of “The Town” are more likely to induce a headache than inspire fear. I could go on. While “Kiss Land” still sounds like the Weeknd, the crudity of its production represents a major step back from that of 2011’s mixtapes.
It’s unlikely, though, that better production could have saved “Kiss Land,” because the album’s biggest fault is Tesfaye’s suddenly insufferable songwriting. Since “Balloons,” Tesfaye has traded in his memorable hooks for increasingly unmelodic and repetitive melisma. The tunes  on “Kiss Land” flounder, sending Tesfaye’s still-perfect falsetto up and down the octaves with no sense of purpose.
  The sharp, spare beats that gave songs such as “The Morning” and “What You Need” their vibrancy have been discarded as well. Instead, on “Kiss Land,” Tesfaye opts for slow, booming rhythms that only serve to highlight the album’s uncreative songwriting. And on the few occasions that Tesfaye does try to speed it up, the results are even worse. For example, the chorus of “Live For” (“This the shit that I live for / With the people I’d die for”) has a rhythm so utterly slapped-together that you feel almost ashamed that Drake has to build the album’s only guest verse around it. Mercifully, at just under four minutes, “Live For” is the shortest track on “Kiss Land.”  As such, it’s one of the few songs on the album in which Tesfaye doesn’t insist on doing in six minutes what he should have done in three. 
“Kiss Land” abounds with such failures. “Belong to the World” sounds like a reject from a Coheed and Cambria tribute album, from its bombastic sound right down to its laughably self-serious lyrics (“I want to embrace you / Domesticate you”). “Wanderlust” starts off somewhat promisingly, but quickly devolves into a Michael Jackson-mimicking vamp built around the phrase (not joking here) “precious little diamond.” Unfortunately, these lyrics aren’t anomalies on “Kiss Land.” Gone are the simple, haunting declarations of “Balloons” (“He’s what you want / I’m what you need”). Instead, Tesfaye populates “Kiss Land” with tongue twisters like “I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place / Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace.”
Two years is a short time, but the artistic decline the Weeknd has suffered since 2011 is nevertheless crushingly steep. If anything, this has to provide some hope that “Kiss Land” is an anomaly, not a sign of things to come. But with a debut album this terrible, maybe the Weeknd should go back to making mixtapes.

In July, Arctic Monkeys’ lead vocalist Alex Turner talked to NME about the band’s latest album, offering up a brilliant and teasing summary of the work as being “a Dr. Dre beat, but we’ve given it an Ike Taylor bowl-cut and sent it galloping across the desert on a Stratocaster.”
“AM”—Arctic Monkeys’ most anticipated studio album since their record-smashing debut “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not”—is a logical next step in their development, rather than a drastic change in orientation. “AM” continues in the direction of “Humbug” and “Suck It And See” by finally completing Arctic Monkeys’ departure from garage rock. Fortunately for the English quartet, this continuity points down the right path, implying a constantly evolving discography rather than creative diffusion.
One of the most striking differences on “AM” is the meticulous production that reflects the tastefully subtle influences of hip-hop on the album. The opening “Do I Wanna Know?” immediately introduces a full and wet bass drum and a snare that sounds more like handclaps. “Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?” also infuses the traditional drum set with hip-hop influences. In addition to richer percussion, the track seems to lift a tongue-in-cheek bassline and simple drum pattern from Eminem and Dr. Dre’s “The Real Slim Shady.”
As a result of these stylistic changes, the tracks on “AM” are often percussively understated, with the album’s focus moving away from drummer Matt Helders, who was both the buoy and the engine of their previous albums. In this respect, “AM” is most like 2009’s “Humbug,” but even on that album, Helders’ technicality made important contributions to the album’s dark character. The role assumed by Helders on “AM” is completely different—with the exception of “R U Mine?,” the tracks feature a drum beat that remains structural rather than embellishing or driving. Although this restrained role fits the relatively restrained feel of “AM,” it’s hard not to miss Helders’ fantastic drum work on more monotonous tracks such as “One For The Road.”
The hole left behind by the lack of complex percussion, however, is compensated for by Turner’s seasoned songwriting. “AM” touches on many of the same themes as previous releases did—unrequited love, femme fatales on pedestals, and social solitude create an emotionally-charged punk dystopia. “No. 1 Party Anthem” serves as the traditional ballad that has appeared on every Arctic Monkeys album to date. Turner’s lyrics quickly switch between preening self-description (“Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona… sunglasses indoors”) and painful honesty (“Drunken monologues, confused because it’s not like I’m falling in love /  I just want you to do me no good / And you look like you could”) against a stickily romantic sea of sound that could split a crowd into pairs of slow dancers.
The meticulous construction of the lyrics and sound world is also reflected in the instrumentation of “AM.” Both “No. 1 Party Anthem” and “Snap Out of It” feature a piano part that seems to act as more than a simple embellishing instrument. On the ballad, the piano takes the place of background vocalists, responding to each of Turner’s lines with a pulsing remark of its own. On “Snap Out of It,” the piano plays the part of a rhythm guitar, using a bouncing chromatic riff to give the track a lighter, bar-rock feel.
However, listeners have to wait until the penultimate track to hear the record’s best-composed song. Turner’s sultry voice and splashes of wobbly guitars on “Knee Socks” come to a spine-shivering climax with the hushed entrance of Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age) singing at the bridge. As a haunting female choir repeats, “You and me could have been a team, each had a half of a king and queen seat / Like the beginning of ‘Mean Streets,’ you could be my baby,” Homme’s distorted psychedelic echoes of the chorus elevate the track through the bridge and climactic outro. The symphonic nature of “Knee Socks” makes it the most intricate and striking track Turner has written to date.
Just how far Arctic Monkeys have come cannot be fully appreciated without a look back at the band’s history. A single listen of their debut album’s final track, “A Certain Romance,” is proof that the talent was always there—cutting lyricism, driving energy, and a tragic lightheartedness make the five-and-a-half minute track seem over too quickly. With these tools, Arctic Monkeys have reinvented themselves four times, once for every subsequent album, each time attacking the same themes and ideas from slightly different angles. Despite being Arctic Monkeys’ fifth studio album, “AM” has the same fire that four 20-year-olds from Sheffield had in 2006—but over the past seven years, the quartet has mastered the flame.

On its surface, “The World’s End” might seem like a predictable summer blockbuster with an alien invasion and copious drinking, but by the efforts of longtime collaborators Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, the film is much more than a mindless comedy. The film serves as a confident finale to the “Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy,”which also includes the much-beloved films “Shaun of the Dead” and “Hot Fuzz.” As with the previous two installments, the immediately enjoyable humor and cheeky references initially belie the thematic and narrative heart of the film, as well as the care and thought that went into the making. 
 
“For the sci-fi element, people want to ask, ‘What films are you specifically referencing?’ Well, none specifically; the problem is that with people who have grown up on genre films, you explain things in those terms,” Wright said in an interview with The Crimson on July 29. He explained that while the film certainly draws on social science fiction from the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s such as “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” this was done in order to explore questions of identity. The film’s (anti)hero, Gary King (Pegg), spends much of the alien invasion narrative struggling to bridge the gulf between his younger and older selves. “There’s a scene where Gary is happy about the fact that there is an otherworldly problem, because it’s easier for him to accept that there might be an alien invasion in progress than that he got old,” Wright said.
 
 “I think all three films are about an individual or a small group of people facing off against the larger homogenizing force, be it zombies, the NWA [Neighborhood Watch Alliance], or the Network. In a way, the Network are a synthesis of the NWA and the zombies—they’re a kind of all-consuming force of regulation in [The World’s End],” said Pegg who starred in and co-wrote all three of the “Cornetto” films. When asked about their inspiration for this theme, Pegg explained, “We’re also from a very small island in the North Sea, and I think that’s part of Britishness itself, being a small thing up against a large group or amid a large crowd. It gets taken to its absolute extreme in this one, and its very fitting that it’s the final installment, because it’s the Earth versus the rest of the galaxy. Earth becomes England in this film, it becomes our little island in space.”
 
Even with the strong thematic undercurrent present throughout the film, “The World’s End,” never forgets that it is still meant to produce laughs. Speaking to the idiosyncratic and rapid-fire style of comedy established in the “Cornetto” films, Pegg explained, “I think that comes from being on the fringes of filmmaking and comedy, we’ve all preferred the alternative strains rather than the broader strokes of comedy, although there is broad comedy in what we do.”
 
“To me, you should never wait for people to laugh,” Wright added. “Sometimes you see movies where they pause for a laugh; you need to just keep powering through.”
 
“The World’s End” derives much of its charm from the undeniable chemistry shared by the real-life friends Pegg and Frost. In this film, Pegg plays the comedic foil to Frost’s straight man, a marked change from the previous two installments in the trilogy, and their experience working together is evident  in their effortless rapport onscreen. “The thing is, you can’t do this kind of screwball, machine-gun dialogue if the performers can’t do it. You have to have a cast that are really great at doing that, and that was really fun,” Wright said.
 
While the three films of the “Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy” are not direct sequels to one another, they are still undeniably a trilogy, with thematic ties, a self-aware sense of humor, and countless stylistic similarities. Wright explained his insistence to the studio on shooting “World’s End” on 35mm film: “I was very strong about it, because I want the three films to look exactly the same. I want them to feel like a piece. I would hate for anybody to watch the new one, if it were shot in digital, to say, ‘Hm, something is weird about “The World’s End,” but I can’t put my finger on it.’”
 
Nine years after “Shaun of the Dead” was released, the end of the “Cornetto” Trilogy has come. When asked during an interview on Reddit.com how he felt about finishing the trilogy, Wright said, “It’s a huge relief that we’re making good on a promise. We are very proud of the movies. We’re relieved that it’s done.”

“Give It 2 U”
Robin Thicke, “Blurred Lines”
Robin Thicke has done it again. “It” meaning, of course, delivering shady pick-up lines in a Justin Timberlake-esque falsetto in between rap verses by hip-hop’s finest. Thicke’s previous single “Blurred Lines” was labeled offensive due to percieved misogynism, but the way he sings “angel” in “Give It 2 U” with a deep, breathy gasp feels like a much sleazier offense. The official remix of the song includes a verse from 2 Chainz in addition to Kendrick Lamar’s original verse, which emphasizes the disparity between the rappers’ talents. While 2 Chainz’s verse features the line “Let’s put this thing in action” repeated six times and two of his signature name checks, Kendrick’s nimble verse features a reference to Olympic athlete Jackie Joyner in addition to rhyming “detrimental” with “credential.”
“Hold On, We’re Going Home”
Drake, “Nothing Was the Same”
Ah, the smooth, relaxing sound of Canadian rap. Drake’s collaboration with producing duo Majid Jordan gave fruit to a song even less hip-hop than Kanye West’s “Heartless” from his genre-bending “808s and Heartbreak.” While Drake’s first single, “Started From the Bottom” was a standard hip-hop anthem with a rags-to-riches narrative, “Hold On, We’re Going Home” is a synth-pop/R&B slow jam about romantic love, the object of which is the “good girl” who’s been increasingly prevalent in hip-hop lately—with the exception of Miley Cyrus, who has left her Disney channel persona in the dust. Perhaps hip-hop radio would embrace this saccharine song if Cyrus were to lend a verse challenging Drake when he sings, “you’re a good girl and you know it.”
"Roar" 
 
Katy Perry, “Prism”
“You’re gonna hear me roar!” asserts a heavily auto-tuned Katy Perry in her latest single, a catchy, midtempo anthem about self-empowerment. And, based on its number of digital downloads, radio spins, and YouTube views of its newly released video, she may be right. A lot has been written about the fact that the track is reminiscent of Sara Bareilles’ “Brave.” Considering the similarities between the songs, the massive sucess of “Roar” seems to suggest that sometimes the popularity of a song is all about the brand, as Katy Perry is a pop superstar while Bareilles hasn’t had a significant hit since 2007’s “Love Song.” “Roar” isn’t breaking any new ground for Perry musically or lyrically, but it is breaking records.

Controversy and raunchy humor are recurring elements in the work of performance artist and musician Kalup Linzy, who is one of the fall 2013 visiting lecturers in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department. Linzy, known for the provocative, gender-bending fictional personas whom he embodies in live performances and video, has also released three albums and two EPs, a film, and a series of visual art pieces. Linzy creates, directs, shoots, and edits many of his own videos. This semester, he says, he will be filming at Arts @ 29 Garden with visiting guests this semester. His work is currently on display at the Visiting Faculty Show at the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts.
The Harvard Crimson: Some of your art, in particular the photo shoot you did with Interview magazine, is reminiscent of the work of Cindy M. Sherman, a photographer known for studio-based self-portraits. Is she an inspiring figure?
Kalup Linzy: When I took photography and art history courses [as an undergrad] and was around the photo lab, she was someone that we all looked at and admired…. [Around 2004] I applied for this grant at Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, and Cindy Sherman was on the panel. She was one of the people who pushed for me to get the grant…[and] I got the grant. She was a big supporter, and she also purchased one of [my] collage pieces a few years back. But what’s interesting about the Interview magazine—that was the first time I had been offered a stylist to do [my] make-up, costume, everything.... It was a turning point for me, because I realized that liked having them do that, and I opened up.
THC: In March, you released your new album, “Romantic Loner.” This music stands in contrast to your videos because of its soothing, soulful quality, as opposed to your raw videos, except for some of the cheekily explicit lyrics.
KL: Look at “Sweetberry Sonnet” and “Sampled and LeftOva” [on my earlier albums] because those were very raw. “Romantic Loner” is attuned to my more natural state, when I am more serious, deep, and introspective.
The first two albums were a little bit more comical. You could tell that the first two albums are songs, sort of prepped for live performances for this particular character, whereas Kaye [the protagonist in “Romantic Loner”] is a video artist and soul singer…. The way I was singing with Kaye was closer to my natural way of singing songs; the earlier two albums were filtered with the character Taiwan. There’s probably more contrast, but I am glad you get the contrast, because I need the difference between Kaye and Taiwan.
THC: Could you talk a little bit about your creative process and your character Kaye?
KL: Kaye developed some years ago.... I wanted to phase out the character Taiwan, because I did not want to do the flower-and-leotard thing for the rest of my life, and he became bigger than some of the other characters. I was trying to figure out how to balance it out. Kaye was sort of an evolution.... A lot of the newer songs were written based on the older songs....  My process sometimes just starts with a character or an idea in the back of my head. Then, once I care to pick it, it turns to the forefront.
THC: You have also appeared in the soap opera “General Hospital” with James Franco, and “Romantic Loner” features multiple tracks that you perform with him. Are you thinking of future collaborations with Franco?
KL: I don’t know. He and his producer, they have so many projects.... There are things written with him in my mind, but I don’t know if they will see the light of day. At the moment, I am working to set up a Skype visit with him and one of my classes.
THC: What are you most looking forward to this semester as a visiting lecturer?
KL: I am really looking forward to seeing what the students will come up with in terms of their projects…. I think it will help me understand where the younger artists are, and what space they are in…. There are teaching artists who have been advising guides to me, and being able to talk to students and have them look to me for some guidance keeps me in a certain place…. I am bringing in some of my visiting artist friends to talk to the class, so I feel like that will put me in a space where I will be really motivated. I am really looking forward to that motivation.

The Le Corbusier-designed Carpenter Center, which could perhaps be mistaken for merely a giant ramp across from Sever Hall, is an odd fixture amidst Harvard’s crimson masonry. For those who use the space, however, it is not an architectural oddity, but a canvas. While students in other departments scrambled through shopping week and the informational firestorm that accompanies the beginning of the year, Visual and Environmental Studies hopefuls and others who braved the Carpenter Center’s imposing exterior emerged into a world of role reversal, in which VES professors took a turn at exhibiting their work. This annual event, the visiting faculty show, runs through September 29 and will hold its opening reception this Thursday from 5:30-6:30.
 
Multiple times a semester, the faculty at the Carpenter Center are charged with filling the building’s concrete shell with a host of works ranging from archived footage and films to curated events in which special guests, themselves veritable giants of the art world, explain their process in the “Artist Talks” series. This constant rotation of artistic material typically showcases the work of those not immediately affiliated with the university. The yearly visiting faculty show, however, gives students a chance to sample their professors’ wares, so to speak, before attending their lectures.
 
Take, for example, Catherine Lord’s “Untitled (36 from the ONE),” in which scans of dedication pages from various texts to form a work of total devotion to the feminine, from the named “Anaïs” to the more abstract “W.M.” Lord’s course, Visual and Environment Studies 149: "Queer Visuality, Visualizing Queer," continues this theme by taking a look into queer studies in art. Kalup Linzy delves into queer art issues as well, and chooses to approach the subject through multiple media. Linzy’s works operate in discourse with one another: his “Conversations wit de Churen X: One Life to Heal,” a video recording of his performance art, forms an expositional narrative for his gouache and photo collage series. His Visual and Environment Studies 66: "Music, Melodrama, and Performance Art" students can look forward to exploring the role of performance in art under the guidance of someone with substantial experience in the medium.
 
While most Harvard students will not have the opportunity to explore further these artists’ works and artistic philosophies through the classes they teach, some of the visiting faculty will be holding individual “Artist Talks” that will be free and open  to the public. Roger White will be speaking on October 15th at noon, and Catherine Lord will be doing the same at noon on November 12th.

The instructions are simple: “Tap Here,” accompanied by the ubiquitous graphic of a Charlie Card. Pat Bordenave, a Boston resident who follows the local art scene, approaches the futuristic kiosks in the Boston Center for the Arts plaza, taps his card, and is bathed in light from a disco ball in response.
 
After the light show, customized to the information encoded in his Charlie Card, Bordenave says that this is his favorite of the three exhibitions he has visited this evening. “I’m interacting with [the kiosk] and it’s freaking cool. It makes me smile.”
 
Bordenave and many other Boston locals have warmly welcomed and engaged with “Culture Tap,” a temporary public art installation created as the brainchild of New American Public Art collaborators Dan Sternof Beyer and Bevan Weissman. The piece will be viewable through October 18 in front of the BCA at 539 Tremont Street and is open at all hours. Visitors are encouraged to visit both night and day for personalized sequences—at night, a light show, and during the day an anecdote from a South End resident about the area’s history.
 
What results is an interesting angle on NAPA’s philosophy, which focuses on putting the control of art in the hands of the audience. “People are the art that we do,” Beyer says. “When people are sharing Charlie Cards and talking to each other, that’s what we are trying to do.”
 
To Weissman, “Culture Tap” stands at the intersection of sculpture and engineering, public-interactive art and data metrics. “Our pieces are not just the physical piece themselves,” he says. “[They] also act as social ice breakers, a little melting pot that people can rally around, socialize about, and [use to] interact with their neighbors in a way they normally would not.”
 On a grander scale, too, Beyer sees “Culture Tap” and NAPA as important contributions to a technological, audience-centric public art experience. “The stories are this awareness of the cultural fabric, and the lights are this awareness that you can change your environment around you, and it makes you look up from your tiny rectangular screen of light. And you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m changing things around me,’ and you’re looking above the horizon.”

Until recently, students largely pursued the arts at Harvard outside the classroom. But over the past few years, the College has increased the curricular presence of the arts—particularly the performing arts. In 2007, Harvard introduced a dramatic arts secondary field that allowed students to receive academic credit for their theater classes. And for the first time this year, the College is offering course credit for students’ participation in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and the Harvard Dance Project; next year, students will also be able to receive credit for the HR Collegium Musicum, the Glee Club, and the Radcliffe Choral Society.
These developments come for many as a sign of progress, but are they enough to change what some describe as a culture that dissuades students from pursuing a career in the arts?
CAREER GAP
“I spent this last summer in Los Angeles for six weeks. I fell in love with the city. I fell in love with the acting industry, so I'll be moving to Los Angeles after graduation to pursue film and TV acting full time,” says Angelique P. Henderson ’14. The aspiring actress, speaking with confidence as she describes her career plans, is one of the few Harvard students who will be pursuing a career in the arts immediately after graduation. However, if the results of recent years’ Crimson Senior Surveys are any indication, a much greater portion of students will wish that they too were entering into an arts career post-graduation. In fact, in the 2012 survey, a plurality of students—a whopping 17.7 percent—indicated that arts was their top career choice.
And yet, despite the arts’ high desirability, only a miniscule 4.1 percent of survey respondents actually planned to pursue a career in the arts after graduation, putting them in eighth place out of 10 on the list of actual careers chosen by Harvard seniors in 2012. The 2013 survey showed a similar trend, with career sectors such as consulting, finance, and technology topping the list of  students’ immediate post-graduation plans.
While financial concerns may be a source of hesitation for some of Harvard’s would-be artists, many of Harvard’s graduates currently in artistic fields and undergraduates considering similar career paths say they feel that the College as an institution encourages a sort of learning that does not promote creative development and often fails to present the arts as a viable career path for Harvard students.
(LIBERAL) ARTS FIRST
Rachel V. Byrd ’13 got her first taste of working in the entertainment industry as a young child, but it was not until she arrived at Harvard that the recent graduate set her sights on pursuing a career as a film actor and director. “My parents had put me in TV and radio commercials as a child, up to the age of three and four, but I went through middle school and high school without doing much of any performing art. Then I got to college and I realized that I really missed it, and that's when acting became a priority for me,” Byrd says. During her time at Harvard, Byrd became involved with a host of film- and theater-centered extracurriculars. As a freshman, she joined the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, and, after directing a play entitled “for colored girls / for black boys” during her sophomore year, she became a member of BlackC.A.S.T., Harvard’s Black Community and Student Theater group. By her senior year, Byrd was the group’s president and had acted in a number of other plays, as well as directing productions such as BlackC.A.S.T.’s “Dreamgirls.”
Byrd is currently working on a variety of film-related projects, but she says she feels that Harvard does not do enough to present the arts as a legitimate career path, or even a field of study. “The administration sees how much work we put into our extracurriculars, and, in my experience, that has been an excuse to not focus on the arts in an academic setting or as potential future careers,” she says.
During her time as a student at Harvard, Byrd felt that even with her extensive involvement in Harvard’s theater scene, she was not getting enough experience and training if she hoped to become a successful actor after graduating. She therefore decided to design her own concentration, entitled Cinedramatic Arts, to combine her passions for both film and theater. Her efforts to develop this concentration, she says, were not met with much enthusiasm from administrators. “Opposition is a strong word, but I would say there was some pushback from the College when I wanted to create a concentration that was centered around a sort of vocational training in the arts,” says the young actress. “I was told that the liberal arts degree that Harvard College prides itself on is meant to be just that—a liberal arts degree, not necessarily one designed for vocational training to prepare a student for a career. My argument was that a lot of our peers who are studying economics or pre-med are most certainly getting vocational education in college, so why is it different for arts?”
But Deborah Foster, a senior lecturer on folklore and mythology and director of studies for Special Concentrations, asserts that traditional concentrations like economics reach beyond professional skill-building. "Economics concentrators are not being trained as accountants. [They are] using economics to analyze the world," she says.
“CERTAINLY NOT CERTAIN”
Unlike Byrd, who has devoted her post-graduation life entirely to the pursuit of a career in the entertainment industry, Leah Reis-Dennis ’13 has chosen to take a more conservative approach as she attempts to carve out a spot for herself in the music industry. “To be honest, I'm not taking as many risks as I could be,” she says. The jazz vocalist and songwriter is currently working on writing and recording her first demo but relies on other jobs on the side—including working as a masters’ aid in Mather House and as a course producer for HarvardX, the university’s branch of the online learning venture edX—to earn money as she makes a name for herself as a musician.
Reis-Dennis feels she suffered as a result of the step-by-step education that Harvard provides, a type of instruction that may not be the most conducive for the sort of creativity and risk-taking often necessary to make it as a professional artist. “As Harvard students, we're taught to follow the rules and complete a set of tasks that leads to a particular goal—whether it's doing well on a standardized test or completing a thesis in an organized way in order to graduate or whatever,” she says. “Harvard unfortunately doesn't always reward the kind of unorthodox and creative self-determination that it takes to pursue a career in the arts.”
The formulaic path to success that Reis-Dennis describes may earn the students a degree but can leave them frightened of the sort of risk-taking necessary to become a successful artist. In jobs with contracts and regular paychecks, Harvard graduates may find that their practice of following specific steps is very conducive to achievement. But in the arts, the path to success is never quite so clear. “If you ask professionals in the industry how they achieved what they achieved, each person has a unique path, and it's impossible to replicate,” Reis-Dennis says. “Getting a career in music can be the luck of the draw. It can be who you know and what connections you have, and it's certainly not certain.”
THE OFFICE
On any given day, the Office of Career Services at Harvard is bustling with students. A few sit at computers, writing resumes, while others wait patiently to talk with an adviser. Some of these students will set up a meeting with Gail Gilmore, the assistant director at OCS and a specialist in arts careers. Often these students will feel, like Reis-Dennis, that the process of getting a job in the arts is significantly different from getting a job in most other fields. According to Gilmore, however, the two processes are in fact quite similar. “What we would do for somebody in the arts is the same for what we do for somebody in education or government or public service,” Gilmore says. “It's the same process of helping people understand what they want, teaching them the skills—teaching them to write resumes and cover letters and teaching them interview skills and how to network—that will help them find what they're looking for.”
Students looking for jobs in the arts face a few unique challenges, however, that might deter many from their goals. In particular, almost all will be initially unable to support themselves with their art alone and will have to take on a variety of jobs on the side to make a living while still continuing to work on their artistic endeavors. “A lot of students will go to New York to try and be an actor or actress. That usually means SAT tutoring to pay the bills, or working as a waiter or something like that,” says OCS Director Robin Mount.
In response to the critique of students such as Byrd that Harvard doesn’t do enough to facilitate the academic study of the arts, Mount asserts that while such criticism may be fair, students ultimately know what they are getting into when they come to Harvard. “If you look at Yale, they have a fine arts major. Harvard doesn't have that. It does make it hard for students, if that's what they want to do, but then they chose Harvard. They could've chosen a different school,” Mount says.
For many students, however, the decision to pursue arts professionally did not arise until after they had begun their studies at Harvard. The fact that most students wait until their sophomore year to declare a concentration encourages a period of experimentation and exploration before one settles in a particular field. Henderson, for example, spent a good portion of her time at Harvard deciding whether to pursue law or business post-graduation. “It wasn't until fall semester junior year that I decided I needed to pursue acting,” she says.
Other students, such as Ben J. Lorenz ’14, are still not certain what they want to do after graduation. Although the Literature concentrator and aspiring actor plans to move to New York to try his hand at acting, he admits that he may pursue other careers and interests later on. “I'm still not 100 percent convinced that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life. It's something I’ve enjoyed immensely in college and something I’ve been able to work at an outrageous amount and still be interested in, which seems like the kind of thing I should look into as a career,” he says. “But I have no idea what it's like not at this place. My back up would probably be to go back to graduate school in literature and then pursue teaching.”
ROOM FOR REVISION
Despite the recent steps Harvard has taken to increase the presence of the arts in the curriculum, many still find the arts course offerings at Harvard to be wanting. For example, the majority of opportunities in the dramatic arts at Harvard—including both the extracurriculars available and the classes offered as a part of the dramatic arts secondary—are primarily centered on stage acting. For students like Henderson, who are aspiring to become film and television actors, the focus on theater is less than ideal. “I very specifically want to do film and TV acting,” she says. Outside of Harvard Undergraduate Television, the opportunities to practice her skills are meager, she says, and there are currently few Harvard courses that cater to television or cinematic acting. “A lot of my training is coming from the theater side, which would be helpful for a film and TV acting career, but it's not exactly the same thing. That's been tough. I definitely wouldn't say that I've been adequately prepared at Harvard.”
The lack of preparation provided by Harvard will not deter Henderson from pursuing her dreams, however. “The goal is to get to L.A. as quickly as possible,” she says. “I’ve seen friends who were seniors go off into their prospective career paths after graduation, a lot of them doing investment banking and consulting and things that they really didn’t want to do, with the plan of making money for two years before they take the time to follow their dreams.” Such a plan does not appeal to Henderson, even though it may be less financially risky. As she points out, nothing in life is free from risk. “Two years isn't promised. Tomorrow isn't promised,” she says. “So I'm not going to waste time. I'm going to go into it now and pursue my true passion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junot Díaz is not out to make friends, or so he claimed at a full Harvard Book Store talk on Thursday. Instead, he sees his function as an artist as distinct  from that of a traditional entertainer. “An artist’s job is to enter silences that the world would rather not have us enter,” he said. Thus, instead of spending most of his time reading from his most recent book, the short story collection “This Is How You Lose Her,” he read only a brief passage before deepening the conversation. Discussion, rather than a one-sided speech, quickly became the tone of the evening.
His talk started off conventionally enough: after catching an audience member’s tossed copy of “This Is How You Lose Her,” he read a brief excerpt. In the passage he opened to, Yunior, the hapless narrator of his previous two novels “Drown” and “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” tries and fails to convince his girlfriend that he was not cheating on her. With evidence of the cheating in her hands, the girlfriend asks what all of the words in his diary were supposed to mean. “Baby, this is just part of my novel—” Yunior responds.
Putting down the book after that pithy line, Díaz took questions from the audience. He said he likes creating flawed characters like Yunior, for flaws drive readers to sympathize and fill in the gaps in the narrator’s lapses. The most successful stories, according to Díaz, are the ones with characters like Charlie Brown who are always missing the football but continue to try anyway.
“Most of us are never kicking the football, and I think that makes us worthy of art,” he said. Yunior’s problem, for example, is that he can never quite achieve the intimacy he seeks. Any character’s repeated mistakes can keep the reader engaged, he claimed.
In addition to presenting the reader with a very human protagonist, Díaz attempts to engage with his readers even further by intentionally leaving gaps, silences, and fractures in the structure of his writing. “I want readers to collaborate with me,” he said. “There’s a reason I choose to write in a fragmented structure.” These breaks in a traditional narrative, he said, give the reader authority to fill in the blanks. As Díaz joked, there may be simpler ways to write books, but enhanced reader engagement is worth it to him.
True to his collaborative authorial form, Díaz was fully engaged and forthcoming throughout the question-and-answer portion of the evening, the topics of which ranged from “the question of the ass in Dominican culture” to immigration in the United States. He did not shy away from pointing out the silences in American society and spoke freely about issues in Dominican culture ranging from male virgins to female subjugation. Passionately opinionated, Díaz readily sought continued discourse by inviting anyone who disagreed with his views to debate with him after the talk: they could form a separate line from those who just wanted a book signed and a picture for Instagram.
Díaz may have initially claimed he did not need to make friends with his audience, but he made a point to form connections with those hailing from his area of the world. He made continuous shout-outs to people in the audience from New Jersey (“Maplewood? When I was a kid I used to mess with a girl from there. Fuck, yes, Maplewood”) and the Caribbean and immigrants in general (“All I know is some of us get rounded the fuck up and get deported”). Along with his casual tone and generous use of obscenities, Díaz placed himself and his stories in a young, Dominican culture in which “his boys”—both created and real—fall in love, fight, and struggle through life.
All three of his books are inseparable from their location; much of the hyper-masculine culture of Dominicans in the U.S. that Díaz describes is what drives his characters to make mistakes. Yet when questioned if the real “boys” back home recognize themselves in his writing, Díaz said he is not worried about that. “It doesn’t make a difference how much you take from your life—the colossal demands of fiction will change the character so much,” he said. Yet it was impossible for listeners to escape his formative background, for much of what Díaz talked about had to do with his life. Since he comes from the same culture in which his fiction takes place, it is hard not to make comparisons between the two, or at least see the inspiration behind his work. “It’s always about Dominicans living in central Jersey,” Díaz joked.
A self-proclaimed loser, nerd, artist, and man of color, Díaz pointed out that he thinks of his own life in similar terms as his writing. He described his life as a flip-book of changing locations, full of fudged yet beautiful relationships. “My relationships always seem to be lexicons of things not said,” he confessed.  But it is these silences that drive his art and his characters, and perhaps compel his audience to keep reading the beautiful mess of narrative he creates.

My president has a lot in common with my favorite meth maker.
Like the story of an upstart senator from Illinois, the saga of Walter White, the Mr. Chips-turned-Scarface at the center of “Breaking Bad,” started out simply enough. Saddled with a cancer diagnosis, a son with cerebral palsy, and an unexpected pregnancy, the brilliant chemistry teacher turned his talents to manufacturing meth—just to leave enough for his family before he died.
To a country that in 2008 was similarly saddled with a slumping economy and scarred from President Bush’s law of war and war on the law, the meteoric rise of Barack Obama glowed with a messianic aura.
But from their initial perches of moral rightness, Barack and Walt both gradually slipped. Walt, the one-time family man, poisons children and bombs nursing homes. The one-time constitutional law professor now ardently defends the unconstitutional surveillance of most and the unconstitutional assassinations of others.
But both didn’t break bad overnight. There’s an intermediate stage—a schizoid split among dueling impulses and personas. For Walt, shell-shocked after too many encounters with megalomaniacal dealers and cartel leaders, it’s the alter-ego of Heisenberg: the drug kingpin who is fearless where Walt is feckless. And for Obama, buffeted by unsubtly racist criticisms as weak or un-American, it’s his alter-ego of the hawkish commander-in-chief putting national security—or least what neoconservatives think that is—above all else.
Like Walt, he wants “to be the danger,” to be “the one who knocks.”
Just like spirits in horror movies, the darker personas fester in secrecy and insidiously subsume the real character—a metastasis metaphorized by Walt’s resurgent cancer.
By the time the persona is publicly revealed the transformation is complete, leaving a trail of betrayal and deception. For “Breaking Bad,” when Walt brutally manipulates his wife Skyler, brother-in-law Hank, and even cooking partner and pseudo-son Jesse, the effect is brilliant television—a drama that subverts the audience’s expectations of a likable protagonist.
President Obama’s undisclosed hawkishness also subverted expectations, but to much less brilliant effect. To the country’s disappointment, the anointed candidate was a dud president—misplaced faith in Anakin Skywalker that begat Darth Vader.
In “The Second Coming,” W. B. Yeats cautions us with a phrase that could be the central theme of politics: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.”
The passionate intensity driving both men is an obsession with their legacies. The president’s dithering, half-hearted administration springs from a spineless fear of criticism—a Neville Chamberlain-like policy of appeasement with the right wing in hope of a more charitable depiction in the history books. Walter needs to avenge the perceived wrong of selling out his third of a multibillion-dollar company for $5,000 because of a personal dispute.
“I’m in the empire business,” Walt says.
“Is a meth empire really something to be that proud of?” his cooking partner Jesse Pinkman retorts.
The American empire is certainly more prestigious than Walt’s. But is it still something to be proud of?
Is the ends-justifies-the-means mentality of the post-9/11 era really any different from Walt’s calculus? If constitutional protections and international laws are seen as mere hurdles to be circumvented through legal loopholes by executive fiat, how does that differ from Walt’s always impeccable self-rationalizations?
And while the “Breaking Bad” finale is in one month, Obama has more than three years left in his term. If the tantalizing flash forwards are to be trusted, things won’t end well for Mr. White. Yet the possibility for redemption, for a radical recalibration of the country’s priorities, still exists for the president.
But it seems unlikely that he would suddenly back away from staunchly defended power grabs like the National Security Agency’s disturbing domestic spying operations, unprecedented incrimination of investigative journalists and whistleblowers under the Espionage Act, or the right of a president to maintain kill lists with American citizens on the rolls.
Walt could well be speaking for the president when he threatens a family member he has ensnared in his web of lies:
“If you don’t know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.”

The one-stop shop for anyone wanting to read completed dissertations is the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Full Text Database. While working with this resource during this summer, I noticed something strange. Many of the dissertations completed after 2011 were simply unavailable, the access restricted. I knew that completed dissertations are also submitted as hard copies to the University archives, so I went there to read what I was interested in, knowing that everywhere in the world bound dissertations are made available by libraries and archives to whoever wishes to inspect them. But I was wrong. At Harvard, dissertations that authors choose to embargo from being released online are also barred from use in the library in their paper versions. They are effectively made top secret. Why?
Almost three years ago, doctoral students started opposing the automatic release of their dissertations online, due to fears that publishers will not be interested in printing books developed from dissertations anyone can read on the Internet. As I was informed by Professor Robert Darnton, the University Librarian, dissertation embargoes were allowed based on a 1951 decision by the Harvard Corporation, but this was intended to be exceptional—to protect sensitive materials. As a rule, dissertations were made openly available at the Harvard Archives. This changed a few years ago, when the deans, responding to doctoral students’ fears, allowed embargoes broadly. As a result, as a search in ProQuest reveals, an unprecedented number of dissertations (almost one in three) produced at Harvard in 2012 and 2013 are embargoed. These dissertations are now secret and the authors can decide how long to keep them so.
The current regulations declare that dissertations must be made openly available as a proof of achievement because a doctoral candidate “cannot have a degree for making a discovery that is kept secret” and that it is “only in very exceptional cases that access to dissertations is restricted.” But embargoes are still allowed. A dissertation can be embargoed for six months, one or two years, and a longer embargo of unspecified length is also possible. It is, however, unclear what this embargo entails. Does one need to prove that an embargo is necessary? Who has the final say? More importantly, given the number of embargoed dissertations in the last two years, is it completely true that restrictions are allowed only in very exceptional cases?
In July 2013 the American Historical Association made public its position on dissertation embargoes. It supports embargoes to avoid jeopardizing doctoral students’ chances at landing contracts with publishers. But the AHA is also careful to say that dissertations should still be made available in hard copy by the home institutions of doctoral graduates.
Harvard’s Office for Scholarly Communication has criticized AHA’s approach. It advocates not only access to the bound dissertation, but also an overall open-access policy. The OSC argues that concerns about online dissertations rendered unpublishable are unfounded. It quotes a study showing that most publishers would consider such a dissertation. Only four percent would never consider publishing one. The OSC believes this is sufficient to show that a maximalist open-access philosophy is appropriate, with the caveat of “flexibility for students in different circumstances, and the shortest embargoes that will serve student needs.” What those embargoes would entail remains unspecified. In any case, given the high numbers of embargoed dissertations this year, the University doesn’t appear to be doing what the OSC preaches.
As a doctoral student, I obviously wouldn’t want to jeopardize the publication of my dissertation as a book, if I were certain putting it online would have this effect. And there are many students using this argument to advocate for embargoes, although the actual data seems to tell another story. There are nevertheless also voices strongly opposing embargoes. One of my friends wrote the following in response to a Facebook post: “Embargoes really make me sad. Even if limited in time, a total betrayal of the spirit we should enter graduate school with: the fortunate among us get paid in all manner of scholarships, and we produce a contribution to our field, and hopefully humanity.” He would only accept embargoes for protecting still-living human sources and sensitive materials.
Whether embargoes are easily allowed or not makes a world of difference to how students might approach their dissertations. If I knew that my dissertation would be made openly available, I would try my best to make it solid and useful for other researchers. But if I could embargo it easily and make it secret, I would have an incentive to only carefully chisel my title and abstract—what everybody can see. As for the rest, only the three very busy professors on my committee could see it. Which of these two visions comes closest to the ideals of what a dissertation should be?
The University needs to create clear guidelines on embargoes, guidelines which strike a balance between the interests of doctoral students and the interests of research. If Harvard decides that dissertations can be embargoed very easily, this might spread to other schools, creating an unprecedented regime of secrecy. I hope, at the very least, that the issue of whether dissertations should be made available online can be disentangled from the issue of whether dissertations should be made available at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a recent Boston Globe story, nature lovers have something to celebrate: The forests of New England have made a vibrant comeback. Our region’s forests prove that environmental progress need not be counter to economic development.
Today’s New England boasts an astonishing 80 percent cover by forests—compared to only between 30 percent and 40 percent in the mid-19th century. Our forests are thicker, our wildlife is returning, and our air and water are cleaner.
Some might expect that such environmental progress could only come with drawbacks for economic growth, but such is not the case. To the contrary, New England boasts some of the strongest economies in the country. New England is the shining example of environmental success and economic power, and the dual forces of specialization and regulation have largely created that success.
Specialization paved the way for increased tree cover by vastly changing how the region approached agriculture. Back in the mid-19th century, farms and villages covered most of the region. As the country’s regions specialized, New England was able to devote less and less of its space to such agricultural ventures. Former agricultural workers moved to the city, and their old farmlands were left to nature’s whim. The only traces of these farms are the winding stone walls that meander through the forests.
While the process of specialization has allowed regrowth of trees largely by eliminating large tracts of agricultural land, there is little reason to think that our environmental gains come only at losses for more agricultural parts of the country. While New England agriculture has used progressively less land throughout the last century, it has also grown greener and more efficient, and the sector is far from mordant. And even though New England’s reforestation may not be possible in the agricultural Midwest, that region was just as agricultural 100 years ago as it is today. Specialization makes the whole system more efficient, allowing reforestation in some regions rather than in none.
Environmental regulation, too, has helped New England’s forests. Massachusetts has among the greenest laws in the country, with regulations limiting the kinds of pollutants that often kill trees. Massachusetts has one of the largest state park systems in the country, and large areas of northern New England are nearly boundless tracts of protected wilderness.
New England’s wilderness renaissance should be a source of pride and inspiration for us all. The environmental problems that we face in the modern world really aren’t unsolvable, and neither does solving them necessitate hampering the economy.

There is a tall twisty sculpture called the Omphalos right in the middle of Harvard Square, flanked by CVS, Johnston Gate, Charles Sumner, and the T. Do you know it? Because it will probably be gone very soon.
What is the Omphalos? In Greek mythology, the Omphalos was the “navel,” or center of the world. This point was often marked by a sacred stone. Archeologists and historians have recovered instances of this special baetylus from Delphi to Jerusalem. And now Cambridge.
Again: What is the Omphalos? A quartet of titanic tourists standing together by Out of Town News, pointing, gawking, and trying to get their bearings. An abstract foreigner in Cubist fashion, exchanging somber stares across the street with Sumner. An ungainly plant with four stalks, sprouting from the concrete near the Pit and attempting to blend in with the rest of the urban foliage. For its 20 feet of stature, it’s actually done a fine job at being discreet; I doubt that many students know it by name. The greater celebrity has surely gone to the Harvard Bixi, the phallic stele still standing between Boylston and Widener.
As the legend goes, the Omphalos was commissioned in 1978 as part of a program to “humanize subway stations.” Enter artist and Harvard professor Dmitri Hadzi, who shrewdly realized that there’s nothing as humanizing as a giant bellybutton. His sculpture is a dedication to the highest profile place in the city, a historic locus of arrival and exchange, adventure and absurdity. The Omphalos in Wonderland. For more than three decades, a monstrous Jabberwock to us slithy toves.
But not for much longer.  Atlas shrugged—an overhead slab broke off of one of the sections a couple of years ago, requiring the introduction of protective metal barricades. Look on my works, ye Mighty! The necessary repairs could cost up to $500,000, which is more drachmae than the MBTA can spare. There is some talk of relocating, but the prophecy promises little hope of its endurance in the Square. These two tons of granite across four colossal columns are fearsome but regrettably unsustainable. You might say, “pride goeth before the Omphalos,” if you enjoy bad forced puns as much as I do.
Fortune favors the bored. Last winter break I was online researching Brutalist architecture for some hopeless reason. One thing led to another, and before long I was observing—via Wikipedia—a sculpture that had stoically saluted me every day for the past two years. It was an incredible and disarming moment. My cyberspace meanderings brought me, inevitably, right back to campus. It’s just as in the myth: Two eagles trace a course around the earth, meeting firmly in its center to mark the Omphalos.
The sculpture is leaving, but this campus has plenty of other nuances for those who will look. The strange apocalyptic symbolism of the upward-facing spine in the older version of the College’s shield. The hidden details in Annenberg’s stained glass. Quentin Compson’s commemoration on Anderson Bridge. Those unaccountable shoes hanging over the telephone line on Dunster Street. Like many places, these grounds are rife—positively haunted—with the ghosts of culture and personality through the centuries. “A spirit moves, John Harvard walks the Yard,” remarked the late Seamus Heaney in his “Villanelle for an Anniversary.” As of last week, it is now Professor Heaney too who walks the Yard. Have you seen the autographed poster he gifted to Adams House after he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995? You should check it out.
Friends, I encourage you to make a pilgrimage to the Omphalos before it’s gone. Gaze deeply into the metaphorical navel—you’ll find plenty of introspection in your four years here and beyond. Reflect on these crossroads, for you join a long tradition of exchange. Ancient Greeks sought counsel from the Oracle at Delphi; in keeping with its namesake, I encourage you to consult the new Oracle at the Red Line while it lasts. Weren’t we told before that the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls?
Go be jaded later. For now, keep your third eye open, an ear to the ground, and a finger on the pulse. While you’re in that ridiculous posture, consider this campus an evolving text with semantic meaning in every detail of architecture and landscape. What you take out of it is limited only by your own efforts at philology and imagination. Notwithstanding our Gutenberg Bible’s protective casing or the brief lockdown during Occupy Harvard, this place remains—even more than we may realize—a site where “the books stand open and the gates unbarred.” So carpe diem and all that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton will be honored at an October 24 celebration marking the 100th anniversary of the Harvard School of Public Health, the school announced Monday.
Bill Clinton will be one of three recipients of the Centennial Medals, which were created to honor “individuals whose creative minds and effective leadership have had an enormous global impact, improving the health and well-being of millions of people around the world,” according to a press release.
Chelsea Clinton will receive the School of Public Health’s inaugural Next Generation Award, recognizing an individual under the age of 40, who is committed to “health as a human right.”
The two other recipients of the Centennial Medals will be Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, and Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway, who both received advanced degrees from Harvard.
The medals, which do not come with a monetary prize, were awarded based on “a consensus process,” said Julie Rafferty, associate vice dean for communications at the School of Public Health.
Although Rafferty declined to comment on the specific reasons why Bill and Chelsea Clinton were chosen, the School of Public Health’s announcement made mention of both individuals’ leadership in the Clinton Foundation.
The presentation of the Centennial Medals and Next Generation Award is one part of the School of Public Health’s ongoing centennial celebration, which will include a variety of events throughout the academic year. The School of Public Health was established in 1913 as the Harvard-MIT School for Health Officers before splitting off from MIT in 1922.
“The purpose of the centennial is as much to look forward as to look back,” Rafferty said. “The events that we’re having...[will] be looking forward as well as acknowledging people that have had great accomplishments already out in the world.”
The School of Public Health plans to use the centennial as an opportunity to solicit donations for the University-wide capital campaign, which will officially enter its public phase on September 21 and is expected to raise at least $6 billion. According to Rafferty, the School of Public Health will be hosting a gala after the award ceremony to kick off its part in the campaign.
“By raising money through the Campaign to support our faculty and students...we can develop tools to eradicate diseases; prevent pollution and promote healthier communities; advance health as a human right; and ultimately lead change and educate the future leaders in public health,” wrote School of Public Health Dean Julio J. Frenk in a message to the school.

Massachusetts State Police have apprehended and charged a 25-year-old man suspected of stabbing a 20-year-old man multiple times Sunday night near the intersection of Memorial Drive and JFK Street, according to a media release issued by the state police Monday morning.
According to witnesses, the suspect, Nicolas Baker of Guildford, Vt., advanced towards the victim, “muttered some comment,” drew a knife, and then, stabbed the victim several times, the media release said. The victim, whose wounds are not considered life-threatening, was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital following the altercation.
After receiving a report of a stabbing at about 9 p.m. Sunday, the Cambridge Police Department initially responded before deferring to state police, since the crime occurred on state property. Early media reports said that the crime had taken place in John F. Kennedy Park, but the Monday media release said that it had occurred on Memorial Drive.
Upon arrival at the scene, police found the victim being treated by Emergency Medical Service operators.
Police were able to locate Baker after witnesses reported spotting the suspect as he walked away from the crime scene and toward Western Avenue Bridge. Baker was subsequently arrested on the bridge and later charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, as well as with malicious destruction of property. He will appear before the Cambridge District Court.
A search of the Harvard public directory suggested that Baker does not have any affiliation to the University. A state police spokesperson declined to comment on the case.

Employees of the DoubleTree hotel in Allston raised a demand for equitable treatment in the workplace during the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Monday night. With the beginning of Harvard’s next phase of development in Allston drawing nearer, Allston residents and task force members alike expressed a desire to address the University’s commitment to equitable labor management.
“We need to guarantee that [Harvard] will not hide behind third-party co-development,” said task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73. “We are now looking at a long series of [inequitable employer situations].”
While Whelan noted that Hilton technically manages the DoubleTree, he said that Harvard’s ownership of the hotel building means that the University bears responsibility for the treatment of its workers. The Institutional Master Plan the University filed in July includes developments that will be similarly co-developed, with Harvard owning, but not necessarily managing, all of the businesses' buildings.
Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement who attended the task force meeting, said that now is a good time to prevent the possibility of inequity in the University’s future developments.
“The best case scenario would be strong language in the IMP,” Bayard said.
After a DoubleTree employee spoke, residents in the audience and some task force member voiced their support for addressing labor language in the plan.
“I felt really proud that my community, for the most part, supported what I had to say,” Guy Rossman, a DoubleTree employee and Allston resident, said in an interview.
Rossman, who was the first DoubleTree employee to speak at Monday’s meeting, said that his job is not sustainable with his current wage and healthcare benefits.
Task force chair Ray V. Mellone, however, emphasized the duty of the task force to look forward to the future, rather than focus on current issues.
“If we’re going to get into labor relations and management, I think we’re on thin ice,” Mellone said.
Addressing the Doubletree employees, he added, “There are certain agencies that can help you out, but we ain’t it.
While the master plan for development in Allston was filed this summer, there remains a comment period until Sept. 24 in which comments can be presented to the Boston Redevelopment Authority for assessment. The task force plans to propose a community benefits package or a list of priorities for community benefits to the BRA later this month.
The bulk of the task force meeting focused on one potential proposal within the benefits package—the creation of an Allston-Brighton Innovation Corridor and the revamping of the Allston-Brighton Resource Center to promote business and workforce development. The proposal seeks to lure business and stabilize Allston’s residential neighborhoods.
“The priority for all this is no empty buildings,” said task force member Cathy Snedeker.

The Cambridge City Council adopted an order encouraging a local labor union to meet with the president of Cambridge-based developer Urban Spaces LLC to address the company’s preference toward hiring out of state Monday evening.
The Ironworkers Local 7, a Boston branch of a union that represents ironworkers across North America, has long been trying to meet with Urban Spaces LLC, over concerns that the company’s practice of hiring out-of-state workers has deprived local residents of work opportunities.
“When they hire the out-of-state contractors, these out-of-state contractors do not come here. They don’t come here. They don’t pay taxes here. They don’t live here, and when they leave here, with the contractors and subcontractors, they don’t pay money in the city of Cambridge like my members and our residents do,” Paul E. Lynch, the union’s business manager, said during the meeting. “We would just like a fair chance for our members and our residents to go to work in the city of Cambridge.”
No representative from Urban Spaces LLC was present at the meeting.
Eight councillors voted in favor of the policy order urging the two sides to meet, with one councillor absent from Monday’s meeting.
This is not the first time that the Council has expressed concerns over the actions of Urban Spaces LLC. Before voting on the order, Councillor Marjorie C. Decker said many residents have complained about the company in the past and described their attempts to reach out to Urban Spaces LLC as “talking to a brick wall.”
The Council also voted in favor of signing onto a statewide letter asking legislators not to allow fracking to come to Massachusetts and on various budgetary measures.

Another Harvard acceptance rate has fallen.
This fall just 7 percent of undergraduates who applied were accepted to take folklore and mythology professor Maria Tatar’s perennially popular course Folklore and Mythology 128: “Fairy Tale, Myth, and Fantasy Literature.” That figure is down from a 10.5 percent acceptance rate the last time the course was offered under a different listing in spring 2012.
Tatar’s course, which accepted just 31 of 440 interested students, was among many that conducted lotteries over the past week to reduce overcrowding in their classrooms. And as course instructors released the results of their random or selective lotteries, many students found themselves the losers of a competitive process.
Just 27.1 percent of students were accepted into Sociology 105: “Sports and Society,” which gave preference to sociology concentrators and seniors in its lottery. And only 30.6 percent beat the odds to gain admission into United States in the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,” which asked lottery entrants to specify their year, high school type, and interest in taking the class.
Faculty members who used lotteries to winnow down their course enrollments expressed regret about having to turn away interested students. Tatar, for instance, called the process “painful.”
But she and other faculty members said they viewed the lottery as a necessary evil to maintain the integrity of their teaching style and the learning experience.
“I think lotteries may often be the price you have to pay for smaller classes,” Steven P. Rozenski, a College fellow in the English Department, wrote in an email. “The educational benefits of having smaller classes outweigh the unpleasantness and challenges of lotteries.”
For her part, Tatar wrote in an email that a limited number of teaching fellows and her desire for a small-class learning environment necessitated a course lottery.
Administrators have said this is not an uncommon occurrence. Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noel Bisson wrote in an email that while Harvard is “unusual” in choosing not to cap the enrollments of most of its courses, logistics do sometimes demand course lotteries.
“There are often pedagogical reasons why a course can't grow past a certain number, and in other situations we might not have been able to predict demand,” Bisson wrote.
Currently, administrators try to predict enrollment numbers by asking undergraduates twice a year to complete Pre-Term Planning, a non-binding online form that allows students to list the courses they plan to take the next semester.
However, applied math and applied physics professor Michael P. Brenner wrote in an email that Pre-Term Planning failed to predict the huge interest in his course Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.”
According to Brenner, the consistently popular class saw an unusual spike in interest this year, with 540 students applying for a seat. Interest was high enough to prompt Brenner and his co-instructor, physics and applied physics professor David A. Weitz, to increase the cap they had been using for the first three years of the course’s existence, 300, to 360.
Many other courses also experienced this unforeseen popularity. As a result, several professors contacted for this article proposed that Harvard reconsider Pre-Term Planning to better predict student interest in courses.
Director of studies for Women, Gender, and Sexuality Caroline Light, who accepted just 26.3 percent of students who applied to take her course Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 1424: “American Fetish: Consumer Culture Encounters the Other,” said she would like to see the College adopt a more formal pre-registration process.
To combat the issues associated with course lotteries, Light suggested the College consider implementing pre-registration “with an automated selection process, by which students are sorted into limited enrollment courses by seniority, concentration, etc.,” giving students advanced notice of whether or not they have earned a place in the course of their choosing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five Democratic candidates vying for a vacant congressional seat met in a crowded auditorium Monday night at the Institute of Politics—competing not for votes, but for volunteers among the Harvard College Democrats.
After briefly introducing themselves to a group of approximately 60 students from Harvard and Tufts, the candidates, joined by a representative from a sixth candidate’s campaign,  fielded questions on issues ranging from congressional gridlock to military intervention in Syria.
The six candidates—who together hold five Harvard degrees—hope to fill the seat for the 5th congressional district, which was left vacant when former Rep. Edward J. Markey won a special Senate election in June.
The district, which includes Cambridge, has historically been a Democratic stronghold, and all of the candidates identified themselves as left-leaning “progressives” likely to vote with the party on partisan issues like gun control, abortion, and health care.
“We are all going to vote exactly the same way on almost every single vote,” said Martin Long, the only Democratic candidate who does not currently hold elected office. “What matters is how we approach it, and how we’re going to fix gridlock.”
While Long said that he would focus on making Congress work more efficiently, the other candidates sought to differentiate themselves by highlighting their work on hot-button progressive issues.
State Senator Will N. Brownsberger ’78 stressed his independence from party leadership and his commitment to transparency in campaign finances. Middlesex County Sheriff Peter J. Koutoujian, who described himself as “a kid from Waltham, down the street,” said that he would work on promoting equal rights for women and reforming education laws.
State Senator Katherine M. Clark highlighted her work on abortion advocacy and family health issues while State Rep. Carl M. Sciortino Jr., who identifies as gay, discussed his work on a transgender equal rights bill.  A representative for State Senator Karen Spilka emphasized Spilka’s work on healthcare reform, and said that Spilka personally wrote “Jenny’s Law,” which reformed Massachusetts’ laws on life insurance.
After Daniel Backman ’15 asked the candidates if they would consider supporting any legislation proposed by Republicans during the Obama administration “in the interest of breaking gridlock”, Long, Brownsberger, Koutoujian, Sciortino, and Clark did not name a specific bill that they would be willing to reach across the aisle to support. Spilka’s representative cited the McCain-Feingold Act and other campaign finance reform bills as a point of common ground with some Republicans.
When asked, the five candidates all said that they would not support military intervention in Syria, and that they were in favor of the speedy implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Sciortino and Long said that they would argue for the implementation of a single payer option in the future.
The six candidates will square off in a primary election on Oct. 15. The primary winner will face one of the two Republican candidates—Boston attorney Frank J. Addivinola Jr. or Mike Stopa, a Harvard physicist—in the general elections scheduled for Dec. 10.

UPDATED: September 10, 2013, at 11:16 p.m.
EdX will collaborate with technology giant Google to develop Open edX, the virtual learning initiative’s open source platform, the two companies announced Tuesday morning.
 
According to an edX press release, the collaboration seeks to broaden the availability of Open edX and its educational tools to individuals and institutions outside of the xConsortium—the group of schools officially participating in edX—by launching the new website MOOC.org. The site, which will be built on Google’s infrastructure and will go live in the first half of 2014, is meant to enable universities, businesses, governments, and teachers worldwide to create and host online courses.
 
HarvardX spokesperson Michael P. Rutter wrote in an emailed statement that the University’s branch of edX is enthusiastic about the collaboration.
 
“We are excited that Google will be helping to further develop an open source learning platform that has and will continue to support innovative teaching by our faculty,” Rutter wrote.
 
In an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education, edX President Anant Agarwal expressed ambitious plans for the platform. “We want to be the YouTube for MOOCs,”he said, referring to the acronym for massive open online courses.
 
However, while YouTube relies on an ad-supported revenue model, edX leadership has yet to cement a revenue plan for MOOC.org.
 
“We want to be able to monetize MOOC.org much the same as how we want to monetize edX,” Agarwal told the Chronicle. “But specifically how we want to monetize MOOC.org is TBD.”
 
Dan Clancy, Google’s director of research, wrote in a blog post on Google’s Open Source Blog that Google will apply findings from its own foray into digital learning to its collaboration with edX. Google released an online education platform called Course Builder last year and will continue to maintain the project while working with edX, Clancy wrote.
 
In addition to experimenting with higher education on MOOC.org, Google has also become a partner in the Open Education Alliance, an initiative which aims to enable student access to education for careers in technology.
 
Both Google and edX already have roots in Kendall Square. Google has its Boston offices at 5 Cambridge Center. EdX, which was founded by MIT and Harvard in May 2012, currently has offices at 11 Cambridge Center and plans to move about a block away to 141 Portland St. in January.

The first round of online voting for this year’s class marshals, who will represent the entire Class of 2014 and plan class-wide events throughout the academic year, began early Tuesday morning amidst enthusiastic campaigning efforts.
A total of 69 students—more than 4 percent of the senior class—are vying to fill just eight class marshal spots. The 16 candidates who secure the most votes in the first day-long round of voting, which ends Wednesday morning at 7 a.m., will be included on a final ballot that opens Thursday.
The class marshal hopefuls completed their candidacy requirements by submitting an online form and a nominating petition with 25 signatures. Soon after gaining approval over the weekend, many candidates began their campaigns in earnest, reaching out to their classmates in search of votes via Facebook messages, Harvard email lists, and even mass text messages.
Some candidates, perhaps recognizing the importance of name recognition, sent out simple messages with little more than a sentence or two, informing seniors of their candidacy and encouraging them to vote. Others included a list of their accomplishments and highlighted their past involvement in the Harvard community, hoping to convince classmates that they were qualified for the job.
A few candidates, who said they were running to give back to the community, sent messages expressing a sense of gratitude and appreciation for their undergraduate experiences at Harvard.
“I love Harvard and I have enjoyed being a part of the amazing community here over the past four years,” Kevin P. Murt ’14, a candidate from Dunster House wrote in a message sent to some members of the senior class. “I want to lead the class of 2014 now, and into the future. We have all put in a lot of hard work and each been through a lot over these past four years and deserve to go out in the best way possible.”
Christopher H. Cleveland ’14, a resident of Cabot House, expressed similar sentiments. “Coming from Phoenix, Ariz., I have been blown away by my Harvard experience,” he said in an interview. “As a Marshal I want to see all of these brilliant individuals come together as one class to commemorate this stage of our journey.”
Friends of the candidates joined the effort, sending out messages and emails on behalf of those running.
Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who is not a candidate for Class Marshal, sent out an email to some seniors speaking highly of Yolanda K. Borquaye ’14, a Class Marshal candidate from Cabot.
“She excels at bringing people together, exuding positive energy, and she is everything I want in a representative of our class: a leader, an intellectual, a friend,” Raghuveer wrote in the email, listing Borquaye’s extracurricular commitments and asking students to consider voting.
Regardless of the campaigning, seniors seemed enthusiastic about the election. Only two hours after voting opened just before 7 a.m. on Tuesday, more than 300 seniors had already cast a ballot, according to Clint Ficula, assistant director of undergraduate engagement at Harvard Alumni Affairs and Development.

In an address to a range of members of the Harvard community in Sanders Theatre on Tuesday afternoon, University President Drew G. Faust conveyed a mixed outlook for higher education, describing both the challenges and opportunities facing Harvard.
Citing the strained financial climate—manifested in the University’s projected budget deficit, curtailed federal funding, and heightened global competition—Faust stressed that Harvard’s upcoming capital campaign would not serve as a “panacea” to these problems. The fundraising effort, named The Harvard Campaign, is set to launch on Sept. 21. 
Faust’s speech, delivered as an opening-of-the-year address, was followed by a question-and-answer session, which lasted around 30 minutes.
Herman “Dutch” B. Leonard ’74, a professor at the Kennedy School and the Business School, served as master of ceremonies, introducing Faust as a President who optimistically asks, ”Why not?,” especially when it comes to the oft-repeated ideal of “One Harvard.”
But in her speech, Faust spent at least as much time discussing challenges and limitations—particularly those of a financial nature—as she did progress.
“American higher education is undergoing seismic shifts,” she said. “And Harvard is not immune.”
One of the obstacles she named was declining levels of federal funding for academic research, a trend that she has spoken about before and lobbied against in Congress.
Faust also emphasized that declining family income levels have dealt a blow to the University’s finances as Harvard makes “major increases” in financial aid. 
These financial aid increases, she said, combined with escalating costs, redundancies across the University, and high dependence on the endowment, have resulted in barely balanced budgets in recent years and the projection of a budget deficit this year.
“When markets and the endowment were booming, Harvard had a greater margin for error,” she said. “We didn’t need to aggressively seek out new and nontraditional sources of revenue. But those days are gone.”
Faust also pointed out that despite some people’s belief to the contrary, Harvard’s $31 billion endowment—the largest of any university in the world—is not a checking account that can be used at will.
“Don’t I wish?” she joked, drawing laughter from the audience.
Following the address, Faust sat down for a conversation with Leonard, who asked her questions, most of which were collected both by emailed and handwritten submissions from audience members. 
While some inquired about Faust’s personal opinions and experiences, others asked more pointed questions. For instance, one audience member asked why engineering masters students do not receive financial aid. Faust answered that while Harvard has seen progress in assisting undergraduates, work remains in the graduate schools—and noted that The Harvard Campaign would have a role in making increased access to financial aid a reality.
When Leonard asked Faust about her legacy, she said she hoped that people would look back on Harvard as having “sailed through these stormy seas” while maintaining its values, such as inclusiveness and broad intellectual inquiry.
In an interview with The Crimson on Monday, Faust said she wanted to put forth a “realistic and somewhat sober picture of higher education” in her speech, “with a hope of communicating to the faculty, staff, and students at Harvard how our responsibility must be focused on making choices in this environment and not simply letting the environment happen to us.”
That environment, Faust explained in both the interview and her speech, is unprecedented in countless ways.
“I think higher education is being transformed more rapidly than certainly any time in my lifetime, and perhaps as rapidly as it has ever been asked to change in all of its existence,” she told The Crimson on Monday.
With less than two weeks before the public launch of The Harvard Campaign, which is expected to set fundraising records, Faust painted Tuesday’s speech as partially an attempt to explain the Campaign’s context.
“The Campaign is an important element as a response and way of dealing with these issues—but it is only one element,” she said.
After Faust’s speech and discussion, a celebration on the Science Center plaza included song and dance performances, as well as food-truck samples and other refreshments. After Faust nearly filled Sanders Theater, the prospect of free food packed the plaza, drawing hundreds of speechgoers and non-speechgoers alike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the 2012 season, then-freshman middle blocker Caroline Holte immediately made an impression on the Harvard women’s volleyball team, registering a team-high 89 blocks. Holte’s 2012 tally was the third most blocks in a single season in Crimson history.
After just two matches of the 2013 season, Holte, a consistent starter for her team, is on point to repeat and vanquish her previous record.
On Saturday, at home in the Malkin Athletic Center, Holte put up 12 of Harvard’s 17 blocks against Hofstra in a 3-1 win for her squad. The sophomore also registered 23 total attacks, the third most on the team, and nine kills, for a team-high hitting percentage of .261. She provided intensity throughout the match, with plenty of late-set kills, including one to clinch the second set, 25-23, after plenty of back-and-forth rallying between the Crimson and the Pride. In the final frame, a joint block by Holte and sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Shults swatted down an attempted Hofstra kill and sealed the victory for Harvard.
The match was the second straight Crimson victory in which the squad bounced back after dropping the first set.
Holte’s 12 blocks is the most blocks for a Harvard player in a single match in two years, when Sandra Lynne Fryhofer ’12, put up 13 at Georgia State in September 2011.
New to the team this season is a group of five freshmen, two assistant coaches and a new offensive system, all of which are making an immediate impact upon the team.
Holte credits these new faces and strategies for the pair of wins the Crimson earned this weekend and for her own accomplishments on the court.
“Last year, our preseason was a little bit rough, so this year we were really excited to come off with a win because we were trying to introduce our freshmen to our system,” Holte said. “We have a new, more concise strategy to follow and that’s really helped improve our game already.”
This new strategy has fit both Holte’s offensive and defensive net play of Holte, who attributes much of her success to her coaches, teammates and the new systems in place.
“I think that we had great stats going into the game that allowed me to see where I needed to block and what specific players I needed to focus on,” Holte said.
On defense, Holte has looked to both the right side hitter and right side blocker to position the ball correctly and set her up for the block, whether it be a solo or assisted block.
“I’m definitely depending on my teammates to help me be in the right spot for the blocking and for offense in general,” Holte said.
Further, efficient setting by rookie Corinne Bain and sophomore Hannah Schmidt has allowed Holte and the other hitters to effectively launch kills at the opposing teams. In the Hofstra game, Bain tallied 28 assists while Schmidt provided 13 of her own.
“The setters are putting up great balls for the middle [hitters] and for the outside [hitters] to hit,” Holte said. “We’re focusing on a quick offense [and] I think the setter are doing a great job of putting up that quick ball.”
The Laguna Beach, Calif. native spent the summer training in accordance with both the strength and conditioning program set forth by her coaches at Harvard and with workouts that are a little tougher to come by in the Cambridge area.
“This summer, I played a lot of beach volleyball because I’m from California,” Holte said. “I did a lot of beach workouts, so that helped strengthen my ability and endurance within the game. It helped me become more quick on offense.”
The rise of Holte, Shults, and fellow sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, comes after the team faced the loss of standout contributors Taylor Docter ’13 and Beth Kinsella ’13.
“There’s something to say about seniors graduating, but there are always players that are going to step into those positions,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “I think our whole team is different. We have a whole different identity this year. We wouldn’t be where we were without our seniors, but we’re a whole new group so we’re excited to capitalize on new strengths.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following an opening pair of losses in coach Pieter Lehrer’s debut weekend, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-2) emphasized that the final scores did not tell the full story of the team’s play over the weekend. Junior midfielder Kevin Harrington said that although the team was outscored by four goals, continued improvement and positive takeaways are the focus for Harvard—not the final tallies.
Although Harvard converted only one scoring strike, it took just as many shots on goal (14) as their opponents over the weekend.
On Sunday, the team flashed its diverse offensive arsenal when it got shots on goal from eight different players. Similarly, despite giving up five goals, the team had two 65-minute stretches over the weekend where it held its opponents scoreless. By comparison, the team managed only two such stretches in its first six games in 2012.
“Despite the score lines, we did a lot of things right that we can go forward with and that will improve our confidence,” Harrington said. “We stuck to our gameplans well and the best thing you can see from the weekend is that we are progressing from Friday’s game to Sunday’s game. On Sunday, we did a lot more things right…and the argument can be made that we deserved to win that game. What we will take away is that we made another step forward and played a lot better.”
Over the weekend, Harrington said, the team’s main vulnerability was to the deep ball on the counterattack. Late in both games, with the Crimson pressing to tie or take the lead in the second half, Harvard was beat by deft through balls through the defense that caught the Crimson out of position.
“I think what has been happening in both games is that we have committed a lot of numbers forward chasing a goal,” Harrington said. “That left our defense line a bit susceptible and Iona had quick players able to take advantage of that, [so] that’s why they could put in those late goals against us when we got pushed too far up in position.”
The midfielder noted that in both cases the team was caught with too many men upfield, the team was playing a more risky strategy going for the win. In Sunday’s case, this strategy came at the expense of defensive tactics like playing safe for the tie.
“You have to commit numbers forward to increase your chances of scoring,” Harrington said. “Our attitude is that we are going for the win every time, even if [that means that] when you make one bad pass then they are coming back at you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite controlling play for most of the game, the Harvard women’s soccer team was shutout on Sunday, closing out its west coast swing 0-2.
“I think we played great,” junior Meg Casscells-Hamby said. “We are just starting out on the season and even though we lost, we learned a lot from the game.”
The Crimson fell to the University of San Francisco, 1-0, in the USF Tournament, which also featured the University of California Davis and UC Berkeley.
“It was a high intensity game,” sophomore Lauren Varela said. “We didn’t finish our opportunities but we were excited with the outcome because it shows that we have a lot of potential.”
Harvard outshot the Dons 16-5 but misfired on all but three of its attempts and couldn’t find the back of the net.
“It was pretty frustrating that we couldn’t put our opportunities away,” Casscells-Hamby said. “We’re just going to keep working on it. We got a lot of great chances we just got to work on putting them away.”
The Crimson also held an advantage in set play opportunities, earning 10 corner kicks to its opponents’ three.
“Set pieces are something that we have definitely been practicing the past few weeks,” Varela said. “We just need to work on finishing them but my attitude is that it is something that will come with more practice.”
The best opportunity of the kind came in the 32nd minute when Cascells-Hamby was fouled by San Francisco forward Sydney Telson with the ball on the outskirts of the box. The play set up a free kick that co-captain midfielder/defender Peyton Johnson drove over the top of San Francisco’s five-player wall and out of play.
The Crimson dictated action in the first half, outshooting its opponents 10-3, but failed to capitalize.
The action heated up early in the second half when freshman forward Margaret Purce put several strong attempts on San Francisco goaltender Madalyn Schiffer.
The scoring began and ended minutes later when freshman goalkeeper Lizzie Durack’s punt found its way to streaking San Francisco forward Mackenzie Krieser, who took the ball towards freshman defender Bailey Gary.
Gary then committed most costly of the Crimson’s 10 foul, which occurred just inside the box on the left side. The chance was awarded to the Dons’ Jaciara Melo, who boomed the resulting penalty kick past a frozen Durack.
Durack and junior goalkeeper Cheta Emba split time in goal. The match marked the freshman’s first regular season action.
“She did amazing,” Casscells-Hamby said. “She controlled our back line and worked really well with the team, especially for just coming into our season. She did great and made a lot of great saves.” 
Durack has yet to record an official save, as Emba, who started the game in net, stopped each of the three shots on goals that the Crimson goalkeepers collectively faced.
Offensively, Purce led Harvard with five shots, including one on goal.
Six other Crimson players recorded a shot in the loss. With the loss, Harvard drops to 0-2 on the season.
The last time the Crimson opened its season out west was in 2008 when the Crimson fell to Long Beach State 3-0.
“We haven’t taken a trip like that in a few years so it was definitely an interesting experience for our team,” Varela said. “Despite [having less than 24 hours to adjust off the 6-hour flight] we came out really strong against Cal which was definitely encouraging and, I think, just goes to show the mental toughness our team has.”

For the first time in popular memory, Harvard University has fallen to Number Two on the U.S. News & World Report's annual list of the nation's top colleges.
Sadly, this year Harvard was unable to earn its traditional perfect score of 100, dropping instead to a lowly 99, while the Princeton Tigers edged out the competition and received a perfect score.
It's not all bad news, though—in fact, we still come out on top by most measures. Harvard maintains a higher six year graduation rate, a higher percentage of students in classes with fewer than 20 students, a lower percentage of students in classes with more than 50 students, and a lower acceptance rate than its New Jersey rival. The two universities are equal on the grounds of ratings amongst high school counselors and differ by only half a percentage point in their average freshman retention rates. Only in tuition do the Princetonians fare slightly better than those attending fair Harvard: Princeton's annual tuition and fees are closer to $40k, while Harvard's clock in at over $42,000.
And yet, further analysis of the report reveals that at Harvard, 59.6% of full-time undergraduates receive some kind of need-based financial aid, while at Princeton, that number sits at only 58.9%. Furthermore, the average grant awarded at Harvard is significantly higher than it is at Princeton: $42,464 as compared to $37,166. So while Harvard may cost more on paper, more students here are receiving help to mitigate that cost.
Take into account the other aforementioned figures regarding graduation, class size, and selectivity, and one is left wondering: where exactly did we lose that one extra point? Maybe we'll never know. Perhaps the folks at U.S. News & World Report simply grew tired of seeing the red brick facade of Harvard's buildings grace the top of their list year after year. Or maybe they knew that the rankings, ultimately, remain immaterial: that a second place finish can do nothing to fly in the face of the hard data and/or stubborn self-assurance that proves that Harvard is, and always will be, the best.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight.
With class back up and running in the Ivy League, there's plenty of news—and plenty of gossip.
 
In fact, Yale administrators themselves may be feeding the gossip with their vague references to apparently unsavory events. According to the Yale Daily News's Cross Campus Blog, a recent email from Saybrook College's Master to residents of the College referenced "weird, creepy and (frankly) disgusting things" that had been happening in the laundry room of late. While he didn't specify just what these disgusting things were,  he wrote, "I can't imagine why someone would do those things, but it has got to stop." Yalies, you disgust us.
And while at Harvard, a baby squirrel has been spotted latching onto students and their backpacks in Kirkland Courtyard, at Yale, there may not be many of the little creatures left at all. The Huffington Post reports that some Yale students say that almost all squirrels are now gone from the New Haven campus. HuffPost says that one student speculated that a blizzard last winter may be responsible for the squirrels' disappearance, while an anonymous Yalie emailed Gawker with the claim that the Yale administrators may have "paid to have all the squirrels on campus killed over the summer."
 
One can only imagine what vendetta Yale administrators would have against the resident squirrel population. The Kirkland squirrel, with its startling dearth of survival skills, should hope that Harvard doesn't get any ideas from Gawker's anonymous tipster.
 
We couldn't find any breaking squirrel-related news down at Brown; apparently there's no mass exodus of tree-climbing mammals there. Brown's dean of the college, though, will soon be on her way out—the Brown Daily Herald reports that Brown's current dean of the college, Katherine Bergeron, will leave her post to become president of Connecticut College, starting in January.
 
Penn's Student Health Service, meanwhile, has announced that it will start giving out free condoms instead of selling 12-packs for $3, The Daily Pennsylvanian reports. And to announce the change in policy, according to the DP, Penn's Student Health Service plans to give out 2,000 postcards and a complimentary condom with each (or, as some recipients might see it, 2,000 free condoms and a complimentary postcard with each).
 
 
 
 
 
Harvard students are no strangers to sitting cross-legged on the floor of a crowded lecture hall floor during the first week of school. Chair space is limited, people stumble out early to catch another class, and professors attempt to eyeball how many students will actually enroll in their courses by the end of the week.
This hectic period, known as “Shopping Week,” is the price many Harvard undergraduates pay to ensure that they ultimately enroll in their most desirable courses. The week allows students to attend classes, listen to lectures, and get an overall feel for specific courses before officially enrolling.
 
“Shopping week may have some problems, but I think it’s a lot better than the alternative,” said Harvard sophomore Joe Hall. “I wouldn’t like having to sign up for my courses based on just information from people—I like to actually get in there and see the classes before I commit.”
 
Harvard is not the only institution employing a shopping period. Yale dabbles with a similar system spanning the course of two weeks. The administration recently experienced backlash from students who often criticized the time frame for its “uncertainty,” according to the Yale Daily News. Variants of Shopping Week extend course registration time for students, but sometimes this extra breathing room can increase stress levels rather than diminishing them. 
“[Shopping week] is achieving its purpose in that you’re shopping multiple classes, but it also means you’re doing the work for multiple classes for that whole week,” Hall said. “That adds an extra burden during that time.”
 
So what is the alternative method of course registration? Most schools across the country require students to register for classes prior to the start of the semester.
 
At Columbia University, registration for the Fall 2013 term occurred the week of April 15, while Princeton usually offers registration in the spring for the fall semester as well. Universities that use this early registration technique almost always allow an add/drop period. 
After transferring from the University of Virginia to Harvard this fall, sophomore Adrian Horton commented on the differences between the classic early registration at UVA and the shopping period type methods of Harvard and Yale.
“UVA was a challenge because you have to pick your classes months ahead of time, and there’s very little feedback or a good way to evaluate the classes you choose,” Horton said. “Plus, most people change their minds in the months before classes start. Class shopping is way more flexible and helps you make better decisions. It’s perfect for indecisive people like me.”
Indecisiveness, however, may plague the avid learner who cannot choose between hundreds of available classes during shopping week.
“This year I shopped 10 different classes,” said Harvard sophomore Dani Feffer. “You have to make some cuts. Sometimes it’s better not knowing all of your options because it makes decision making that much harder.”

The day that everyone and their college counselor has been waiting for has arrived: U.S. News & World Report's list of the best colleges and universities in the nation is here.
Despite a change in methodology which places less weight on class ranking and more on graduation and retention rates, a comparison between last year’s list and this year’s reveals little change in the line up. Ivy League schools still dominate the list of top-ranked national universities, with a slight variation in order at the top—Princeton alone took the top spot this year, a change from last year's first-place tie between Harvard and Princeton.
Besides being ranked, nearly 1,800 schools are broken down into various categories, from Liberal Arts College Rankings to A+ Schools for B Students. The Up-and-Coming Schools list features less well-known schools that may be worth checking out, like University of Maryland-Baltimore and Berry College.
Intended to help students choose the right college for them, the U.S. News and World Report rankings use 16 weighted factors to generate the list of America’s top colleges and universities.
