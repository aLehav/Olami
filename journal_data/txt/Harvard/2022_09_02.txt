Michelle Hart’s debut novel “We Do What We Do in the Dark” follows Mallory, a first-year in college, as she navigates an affair with an older married woman who teaches at her university. Tactfully written with keen insights into loneliness, lust, and loss, the narrative is a Pride Month must-read.
Hart’s novel excels in its depictions of sexual intimacy between women. These moments are often brief but do not shy away from the intensity of sexual gratification. Hart writes in a way that is both straightforward and incredibly sensual: She avoids unnecessary abstraction, demystifying queer intimacy with detailed accounts of how Mallory pleasures herself and other women.
These euphoric scenes are expertly contrasted with descriptions of the deep sadness that comes with losing a loved one. This juxtaposition, coupled with the novel’s manipulation of time, ensures that the plot is dynamic and engaging. Hart alternates between the past and present to reveal more about Mallory’s family history, namely her mother’s battle with cancer. She captures the protagonist’s complicated grief brilliantly, in a manner that anyone who has gone through a similar situation will find familiar. Mallory remembers her mother’s illness, but more importantly, remembers her resilience and her warmth.
Another wonderfully relatable element of Hart’s novel is her portrayal of the college experience. While not every college graduate may share the experience of having an affair with a professor twice their age, they can certainly commiserate with Mallory’s struggle to find a sense of belonging on campus. At the beginning of the novel, Hart adopts the quintessential first-year mindset, flawlessly articulating the exciting potential for social growth that one feels when they first arrive on campus, as well as the disappointing realization that finding the right people is a challenging task. It is only over time that Mallory expands her social circle beyond her roommate and discovers a feeling of security — a comforting arc which many upperclassmen and college graduates can attest to.
The plot of “We Do What We Do in the Dark” is driven primarily by character interactions and relationships. Hart devotes little time to worldbuilding, but what she lacks in setting description she makes up for with a sharp focus on her characters’ personal and private struggles. Most of the relationships in the novel are captivating and have a clear purpose, such as Mallory’s moving friendship with the mother of her childhood best friend. Alas, the relationship upon which the narrative most heavily relies — Mallory’s romance with the professor — falls short.
This relationship feels incredibly one-sided and difficult to become invested in. Although the novel is written from a third-person point of view, it might as well be a first-person narrative. Readers are granted unlimited access to Mallory’s complete and utter infatuation with the older woman; just as much as Mallory wants to be with her, she wants to be her. She dreams of following in the woman’s footsteps, thinks about her constantly, and is concerned with her whereabouts long after the affair comes to an end. Conversely, readers have little access to the other half of the affair. The woman’s name is kept a secret and she exhibits an unsettling coldness when she doesn’t express her affection with the same enthusiasm as Mallory. Their relationship is supposed to serve as the novel’s foundation, but with one character giving so much and the other giving so little, the end product is an underwhelming and confusing romance.
Nevertheless, each relationship in the novel yields growth for Mallory and her partners. Hart creates a space for Mallory to explore her queerness and experience intimacy with different genders without shame. Even at a young age, after kissing a woman she knew in high school, Mallory feels “giddy and electric.” Hart wisely refuses to let homophobia intrude upon the narrative, normalizing queer love and attraction in both public and private settings. Her debut novel is an undeniable success, an elegant coming of age story that gets to the core of what it means to be human.

“Good Arguments: How Debate Teaches Us to Listen and Be Heard” is the debut book from two-time world champion debater Bo H. Seo ‘17 HLS ‘24. Seo’s entrance into the literary world is an ambitious and engaging read that is part memoir, part compendium on competitive debate, and part call to action. Seo spends the book’s nine chapters tactfully weaving these elements together into a one-of-a-kind nonfiction work that leaves the reader with fascinating insight into his own worldview and personal development, the high-powered world of debating, and subjects as vast as Ancient Greek pedagogy, the emergence of Lincoln–Douglas debate, and Balinese macaques.
The book is divided into two parts: The first is a presentation of the five components of competitive debate and the skills needed for each. The second applies debate to four core areas of life — bad disagreements, relationships, education, and technology — to show how good arguments can improve both society and the reader’s private life. The aim of the book is not to shy away from disagreements but rather to run towards effective ones, as Seo writes that good arguments can lead to good, helpful disagreements.
One of the book’s many highlights is Seo’s commitment to this central goal. Every personal experience and political or cultural event that he includes informs the substance of the many printed charts, mnemonic devices, and other teaching tools found in the book’s pages. These tools are meant to be handy guides to strengthen the reader’s argumentative acumen, focused on delivering actionable and digestible advice rooted in Seo’s experience and logic.
Seo’s life is the novel’s enchanting backdrop, narrating his transformation from a shy and agreeable elementary schooler to collegiate competitive debater and eventual college graduate and retired debater. Seo reminisces on various playground disputes at his elementary school in Seoul, where he saw the value in argument, and the linguistic and cultural misunderstandings that led to further interpersonal conflict upon his family’s move to Australia when he was eight — experiences that made arguments with peers or teachers seem like more trouble than they were worth, as they often led to hostility and isolation. These childhood years that had conditioned Seo not to engage in argument were not at all indicative of what would soon unfold, as he unassumingly began debating and quickly realized that he quite liked it.
As Seo’s debating career progresses and he wins both the World Schools Debating Championships and the World Universities Debating Championships, he continues to present his life as one spent constantly running towards good arguments. His own personal toolkit thrives and expands as he picks up and effectively deploys various written and oral strategies for crafting better arguments, all of which he is eager to share with the reader, demonstrating how he’s applied them in his own life to help us see how we can do so in ours.
While the desire to engage in better arguments may be the main drive to pick up the novel — and Seo certainly delivers — his own words and stories will likely stay with the reader much longer than any one strategy or tool to recall in times of conflict. And that’s not a bad thing; Seo’s own experiences are very much the lifeblood of the novel, telling a powerful story about immigrating to a new country as a small child, remaining calm under pressure at high-level debate tournaments, finding one’s way socially and academically in college and beyond, and coming to terms with the losses and the inevitable conflicts that are incurred throughout.
By lending so much of his own voice to his novel, rather than simply publishing a how-to guide on formulating good arguments, Seo competently leads by example, proving to the reader time and again how the simple choice of intending to engage in a good argument can lead to more productive and courteous disagreement and debate. If a particular strategy of Seo’s sticks with the reader, that’s all the better. But what is more likely is that focusing on one’s intentions and making the active choice to approach future interpersonal and social conflict from an optimistic, “good arguer” vantage point will do wonders in and of itself. That weighty, humanizing impression will likely sustain itself in the hearts and minds of readers long after precise debate tactics are relegated to the subconscious.
The book should be of particular interest to Harvard students and alumni. Seo has a knack for vivid, grounded thick description that prefers accurate and full portrayals of his undergraduate days to overstated glorification. Even better, his propensity for name-dropping adds a layer of unanticipated relatability to his tales, with the likes of Grendel’s Den, the “twenty-four-hour pharmacy on Massachusetts Avenue,” and the now-defunct Border Café cited as the settings of many of his — and our own — quotidian yet formative collegiate experiences.
Seo’s unwavering commitment to doing the best with what he had throughout his debate career is — to paraphrase anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff — no small potatoes when looking back at one’s life’s work. This message alone makes Seo’s memoir an illuminating read for people of all ages hoping to find some lessons and inspiration within his wonderfully introspective biography. The prospect of learning how to have better arguments in the process? That — to paraphrase Seo — is just pure gravy.

Even before the original “Top Gun” released to explosive reception in 1986, Paramount Pictures wanted Tom Cruise to sign on for a sequel. Cruise, then America’s newly minted heartthrob and de facto promoter of aviator glasses, was hesitant to commit. At just 24 years old, his career was still gaining steam and he itched to expand his repertoire.
Since then, 36 years have passed. The extended stretch between the two films, exacerbated by a postponed release due to the pandemic, has dramatically expanded “Top Gun”’s viewer base. “As time went on, every year I would release a movie, people would be like, ‘What about ‘Top Gun?’ Make another ‘Top Gun,’’” Cruise said in an interview last month. “And it didn’t ebb — now, it was generational.”
Like the 1986 original, “Top Gun: Maverick” follows Tom Cruise as Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. This time, though, instead of being a cocky prodigy enrolled in the U.S. Navy Fighter School, also known as “TOPGUN,” he has to teach the newest class of elite fighter pilots. Contending with the specters of his past, Maverick struggles to train a new generation of TOPGUN pilots for a risky operation that involves neutralizing a uranium enrichment plant built in violation of a transnational treaty. Though decades have passed since Maverick’s education at the exclusive military base, his unorthodox approach to flying has not. He struggles to gain the trust of the young, talented lieutenants — particularly Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick’s late best friend and former colleague Nick “Goose” Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards). Goose dies while flying alongside Maverick in the first film. Beyond its stunning aerial sequences, punchy dialogue, and balanced sentimentality, the most interesting aspect of the film is its implicit meditations on change.
“Maverick” is animated by the titular protagonist’s anxieties about the passage of time. In a private and stirring exchange, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet Admiral Tom “Iceman” Kazansky (Val Kilmer) tells Maverick, in reference to the latter’s lingering guilt over Goose’s death and his reservations about sending Rooster on the new mission: “It’s time to let go.” The ghosts of Maverick’s past lend the film a strong meta-structure: Just as Maverick contends with history, so does the film itself. Like its protagonist, “Maverick” does not forget its past or deny the call of the future. It listens, as Maverick does, to Iceman’s bittersweet words. The result is a film that soars, reaching even greater heights than the 1986 original. Cruise’s latest is an uncommon generational event.
Even for the uninitiated, the aerial lingo of “Maverick” isn’t confused or overwrought. The seamless integration of viewers into the world of TOPGUN is one of the film’s many successes: Through sharp dialogue, understated yet revealing idiosyncrasies, and anecdotal glimpses into characters’ pasts, “Maverick” welcomes long-time fans and neophytes alike to the California base with ease. The first few scenes in which the young pilots take to the skies are especially vital in orienting viewers to the particular insecurities and strengths of the new class — not to mention this introduction is wildly entertaining. Natasha “Phoenix” Trace (Monica Barbaro) proves herself a dependable partner, encouraging her new weapon systems officer Robert “Bob” Floyd (Lewis Pullman) in the face of taunts by the hubristic Jake “Hangman” Seresin (Glen Powell), who cruises through challenging drills at the expense of his partners. The camera’s focus on these granular interactions lend rich windows into characters’ personalities.
The TOPGUN crew put its jovial camaraderie on display in a bar owned by none other than Maverick’s former romantic interest Penny Benjamin, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly. (While Penny is not featured in the 1986 film, she is mentioned in an early scene). Despite the film’s attempts to paint the captain’s love interest in bold strokes, Penny ultimately falls flat, serving primarily as a source of solace for Maverick in times of self-doubt. A scene in which she steers a boat across unruly waves — her feet planted firmly on the dock as a wobbling Maverick clutches onto the jostling vehicle for support — aims rather simplistically to paint her as headstrong. Yet this persona is never given the airtime to fully develop. The film’s struggle to lend strength and dimensionality to its women extends to the skies. Though Phoenix — notably the only woman to fly on the six-person mission — is a formidable lieutenant in her own right, she unsurprisingly plays the role of mediator, serving as a liaison who steadies and soothes towering male egos.
As D-day approaches, “Maverick” grapples with the cinematic responsibilities of elevation and erasure. Vast, exhilarating aerial sequences frequently render Cruise larger-than-life. Ever the determined risk-taker, he escapes death time and time again by the skin of his teeth; indeed, he behaves not dissimilarly to a demigod. This stratospheric stature is extended selectively to those who wear the red, white, and blue flag on their uniforms. The enemy fighters are faceless, rendering them effectively dehumanized, and don opaque black head protection, all uniform, juxtaposed sharply with the American pilots whose call signs are embossed on their colorful helmets. The contrast between vibrant individuality and monotone conformity is not just a cinematic technique, but also a common feature of military narratives — one that makes foreign death easier to swallow on the home front. Amid the riotous entertainment, the darker subtexts of “Maverick” are easy to overlook. That doesn’t mean viewers shouldn’t scrutinize the film’s choice to paint a deeply asymmetrical portrayal of the human impact of military violence.
The heavy symbolism of the film extends beyond the binary of “us” and “them.” In fact, “Maverick”’s most impactful symbolism lies in the tools it uses to convey arguments about the inevitability of change. One of the most notable is an unsuspecting aircraft that becomes tremendously handy later in the story: an antiquated F-14 Tomcat that an aghast Rooster refers to as a “museum piece.” As Maverick navigates the aircraft in a nail-biting dogfight with the enemy’s sleek, obsidian planes, the symbolic message resounds: Despite the inexorable march of the future, the best of the past endures.
As the F-14 cleaves the clouds, Maverick clenches the grimy controls with Rooster in the backseat — an image strikingly reminiscent of his former partnership with Goose. The film’s thesis on the relationship between the past and present is aptly captured in Maverick’s response to Rear Admiral Chester “Hammer” Cain (Ed Harris), who insists the captain’s kind is set for extinction.
“Maybe so, sir,” Maverick says, an imperceptible grin flitting across his face. “But not today.”

Nell Stevens’s debut novel “Briefly, A Delicious Life” is undeniably imaginative, but a cornucopia of creativity cannot make up for several large-scale drawbacks. After several successful short stories and memoirs, Stevens’s’ novel definitely makes a splash — or tries to at least. The historical fiction lesbian romance ghost story bites off more than it can chew and ends up failing to do anything successfully. The plot somehow both meanders and stagnates, the characters have little development, the adolescence of the narrator makes the narrative feel juvenile, and the historical component reads like a quasi-forgotten interlude. The concept is compelling but would have been better suited for a short story.
The biggest issue with this book is that it simply tries to do too much at once. The premise — even the summarized version on the back cover —is intricate and somewhat nonsensical: A 14-year-old 15th century ghost, Blanca, haunts an abandoned monastery on the tiny Spanish island of Mallorca and, 400 years after her death, falls in love with one of the monastery’s living residents. The object of Blanca’s affection just so happens to be one of the most notable writers of the Romantic Era, George Sands, who is accompanied by her two children and her lover Frédéric Chopin. The book follows several storylines and thought avenues: the story of Blanca’s life and death, her undead existence pre-George, her exploration of her sexuality, the current state of affairs in the monastery, and George’s life pre and post monastery.
For most of the book, there is a somewhat consistent cadence of alternating from Blanca’s past, the present, and George’s past, but about 80% of the way through the book there is a clunky, awkward interlude where Blanca is supposedly “looking into” George and her family’s futures and sharing it with the reader. This section felt like Stevens forgot that these characters are based on fact and wrote a long, somewhat artistic synopsis of the information available on George Sands’s Wikipedia page to put this book back on its historical fiction track.
And this Wikipedia-esque addition towards the end of the book is the beginning of an anticlimactic conclusion to the novel. Because Stevens begins to rely heavily on the lives of the real characters, the book ends the way anyone that so much as Googled Sands once would expect it to — the ending so closely follows the real lives of her characters that it comes off as unoriginal. Not only was this ending disappointing, it also feels lazy, as if Stevens ran out of steam after a whirlwind of the first 220 pages and simply could not think of a faster way to wrap the book up.
Not only do the real lives of Stevens’’s characters serve as a crutch, they also create a serious hindrance for the scope of the novel. Because the narrator is a ghost, there is only but so much that can occur between Bianca and her living companions. And because Stevens sticks relatively closely to the course of her characters real lives, her creativity only has so much space to roam. Stevens spends most of her time telling the readers what her characters do, rather than showing us who her characters become, which ends in the characters not becoming much of anything at all. With both of these firm constraints on the scope of the book, the novel ends up being a collection of short episodes or adventures tacked together by mild adolescent commentary and humor.
In terms of the writing, Stevens captures the voice of her narrator very well. But, that ends up being part of the problem. The voice and personality Stevens gives her narrator makes the prose read as juvenile, and the attempt at giving the narrator a casual and familiar tone with the reader ends up just coming across as unnecessary “fluff.”
The book does have some successful elements, however. Stevens has a strong sense of the absurd, employed in a way that can be effective, and the reality she creates, in terms of Blanca’s abilities and experience as a ghost, is entertaining. The content of this book could have been a successful short story, and the writing could have made for an impressive young adult novel, but together, the plot and writing make this adult novel feel young and distracted.

Roadrunner, New England’s largest indoor general admission venue and Brighton’s newest concert spot, opened its doors on Aug. 2 to pop-funk duo The Driver Era. The group is comprised of brothers Ross and Rocky Lynch, with another Lynch brother, Riker, currently joining them on tour. The Lynch brothers had previously performed as the band R5, and Ross is beloved by older Gen Z-ers for starring on the Disney Channel show “Austin and Ally” earlier in his career.
Although they didn’t take the stage until five past nine, their entrance instantly sent a buzz through the room: Amidst a flourishing dramatic drum solo, the crowd chanted something unintelligible, something like a throbbing mass of anticipation. Purple strobe lights pierced through the darkness, and the silhouette of the brothers appeared onstage. It was an unforgettable entrance, visually and sonically.
The brothers’ raw energy was palpable — Rocky immediately started jumping to the beat as Ross shredded on his guitar, diving right into the music of the night. The general admission layout of the Roadrunner lent itself well to the Driver Era’s performance style — their energy seemed to radiate as waves into the crowd of listeners who were just as enthusiastic to be there, filling the space with a charged air.
The strobelights eased the transitions for the first few songs, changing from deep purple to red to sunset yellow and blue on cue with the beat. The first word spoken that night was “BOSTON!” shouted by Ross before the beat dropped to their latest release, “Malibu.” During the song, there was a brief musical interlude where the boys did a salsa-esque twirl around the stage, as the lights switched over to a sultry green, matching the vibe of the moment. By the end of the song, the boys were panting along with the crowd, which had been jumping and shouting as if performing in tandem with the band. Ross yelled out, “Y’all having a good time tonight? I see that!” — and his cocky smile charmed a smile onto each face in the crowd.
The hall lit up red as Ross dropped his guitar, thrusting his hips — à la the iconic Austin Butler move from Elvis — and throwing his hair back to the beat, crooning out “You keep it natural, natural / Turn it up, strip it down / Clothes on the ground / Don’t you make me wait too long.” Rocky danced around, donning a pair of red shades, matching the lights. “One more time!” he shouted, inviting the crowd to join in on the fun by singing the pre-chorus.
The musical diversity of the concert was fascinating; their song “Take Me Away,” for example, crescendoed from a croon accompanied by just drums to an octave higher shout supplemented by guitar and vocal harmony. Later, under the backdrop of pure white lighting, Ross’s a capella falsetto soared through the air, a brief but memorable vocal highlight of the night. There was even a sprinkling of a cover of Drake’s “Hold On, We’re Going Home” — smooth and effortless. At one point, the boys encouraged the crowd to sing along to the ad libs as an intro to “Preacher Man,” their iconically edgy debut single.
“How all my ladies doin’?” Ross cheekily said later on, and was met with ear-piercing shrieks – which seemed to reverberate outside the walls of Roadrunner and into the streets of Brighton. Ross himself was blown away by the crowd’s energy, quickly apologizing with a “I’m sorry, I should’ve said plug your ears!” He started to tease-sing the lyrics “It’s getting hot in here…” under his breath and the crowd went wild. Indeed, he had taken his black shirt off earlier in the night, leaving him in just a white muscle tank — mesmerized, the crowd cheered him on to pick up where he had left off. Ever the charismatic performer, he break-danced during an instrumental break, reminding everyone just how deadly of a triple threat he is.
The chemistry shared by the brothers was electric — whether they were sharing a mic or facing each other while playing guitar, there was a sense of ease they had with each other. Ross’s fun, floppy allure balanced by his brothers’ cool exterior made for a magnetizing stage presence. Their vibe was such a paradoxical mix of laid back smoothness and hyper-intensity — somehow, it just worked to their advantage. Their unique flair enthralled the crowd at the Roadrunner, leaving behind sparks of an unforgettably mesmerizing concert experience.

This review contains major spoilers.
With an innovative plot structure, undeniably lovable characters, and a never-before-seen, all-powerful monster enriching an already beloved series, it is no surprise Season Four of “Stranger Things” has already racked up 1.15 billion hours of watch time, becoming Netflix’s second most watched season of all time.
In a departure from Netflix’s usual approach of releasing a series all at once, Season Four was split into volumes, released on May 27 and July 1. While Volume Two only adds two new episodes, each has a runtime equal to that of a feature film: Episode Eight is one hour and 20 minutes long and Episode Nine is a stunning two hours and 20 minutes.
In terms of plot structure, Season Four seems to adhere to the formula established in the show’s previous three seasons: Once again, the ragtag group of Hawkins’ fearless young defenders splits up only to reunite for the final battle. However, the greater magnitude of the season meant that these three main character groups were forced to further splinter and fight their respective battles in separate locations. In Hawkins, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Eddie, Dustin, Lucas, Erica, and Max are gearing up to courageously defeat Vecna, the antagonist at the center of the season — and perhaps the whole series. Hopper, Joyce, and Murray are battling not only Soviets, but also demogorgons in the chilling Soviet Union. Finally, Mike, Will and Argyle are attempting to find Eleven, who has found herself having to fight for her life after regaining her powers. While this seemingly familiar structure leaves viewers expecting a team-up in Volume Two, the last two episodes provide a refreshing change to this format, as each group fights Vecna separately through the entirety of the grand finale.
Volume Two also follows the jaw-dropping reveal that the main villain of the season, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) is Henry Creel, otherwise known as One — the seemingly friendly orderly who helped Eleven during her time in Hawkins Laboratory. An undeniable success of the season is its main antagonist's ability to further develop the plot and tie together loose ends from every other season of the series (as the audience learns that each monster from each previous season was controlled by Vecna). Vecna — as the most powerful character seen so far in the series — foreshadows a real risk never before seen: bringing the Upside Down to Hawkins and eventually, to the world until both realms become one. This risk is what successfully draws in the audience, as Vecna has the ability to kill off beloved characters and overpower the main superhero of the series: Eleven. Season Four has the most compelling, albeit complex plot the series has seen to date.
In addition to its clever plot, “Stranger Things 4”’s expertly curated soundtrack sets the season apart. The Duffer Brothers, the creators and writers of the show, brilliantly aligned a popular ’80s tune to the most intense scene of the season — merging both an undeniable sense of nostalgia with emotional investment in the song, even for a young audience who is listening for the first time. For these reasons, “Running Up That Hill” by Kate Bush, originally released in 1985, exploded in popularity, reaching No. 1 on the UK Billboard Singles Chart and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 following the season’s release. Bush’s chart-topping song creates an emotional tie between characters and soundtrack that heightens the sentimental impact of each scene.
Going into Volume Two with anticipation of a death count did not soften the blow of losing several beloved characters. Despite evading Vecna earlier in the season (using “Running Up That Hill” as protection), Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) ultimately finds herself being seconds too late from being saved in the final moments of episode nine. Still, Max’s desperation to survive fuels Sink’s brilliant performance, which is by far the most impressive of the season. Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) — an endearing new addition to the season – similarly dies tragically during the final scenes of the last episode. However, Eddie’s death scene allows Quinn to shine, as he maintains Eddie’s cherished charisma and love for the other characters until his last breath.
Complementing standout performances from Sink and Quinn, the series features impressive visual effects, with each episode costing about $30 million to produce. The last episode is able to seamlessly transition from the small town of Hawkins to the haunting Upside Down, allowing viewers to witness more of this realm than ever before. Vecna’s Lair and the Creel House are easily the most frightening sets of the series and allow the fourth season to embrace the horror genre while moving away from the original, lighter-hearted sci-fi elements of the first few seasons.
“Stranger Things’” most successful and engaging season, however, is not without its faults. While the characters of the show are split into smaller groups, the show’s massive cast sidelines many fan favorites for the entirety of the season, including Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), who was a major character in the first two seasons of the series. With an ensemble cast so large, it’s inevitable that every character won’t be given the arc they deserve. This also means that the tragic deaths that occur at the end of each season — which are almost expected by audiences at this point — perhaps serve the purpose of freeing up narrative space to introduce new characters in the next season. This finale also gives viewers an “Avengers: Infinity War” style penultimate ending, as Vecna is still alive and Hawkins remains in danger. The result is disappointing and unsatisfying for viewers expecting a grand victory over the season’s villain. Now, the true redemption of the cast will have to wait for the Endgame of “Stranger Things”: the fifth and final season of the series.
In simple words, this season’s successes greatly transcend its faults. “Stranger Things” is an undeniable fan-favorite, even causing Netflix to crash for a brief time when Vol. 2 was released. Just as the show’s immense fanbase was in great anticipation for the final two episodes to an outstanding penultimate season, many eagerly await the final season. And, the exorbitant funds and dedication spent on this season is cause to excite fans for an extraordinary, satisfying end to the beloved series.

Some know him as the Tony award-winning star of the Broadway musical, “Dear Evan Hansen.” Others as the star of Ryan Murphy’s Netflix series, “The Politician.” And others, still, as “the main dude’s friend” from “Pitch Perfect.” But now, it seems that Broadway and Hollywood’s darling son has moved on: first with the release of his debut solo album, “Sing to Me Instead,” in January 2019, and then with “Reverie” in August 2021. And next week, Ben Platt, joined by indie-pop duo Aly & AJ, embarks on his “Reverie Tour” across North America. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Platt to discuss his upcoming tour and the evolution of his artistic voice.
The Harvard Crimson: Alright, well, let’s get started with the tour. First of all, it’s a cross-country tour, from Madison Square Garden to the Hollywood Bowl — how are you feeling about it?
Ben Platt: I’m feeling excited. I mean, it’s been so long, so there's a lot of nerves built up — especially because I've spent most of my life performing, since I was very, very young — and this is kind of the longest stretch that I've gone away from it. So I feel very eager to get back into that comfort zone of mine…. And we’re playing at the [Hollywood] Bowl, and, you know, my first job that I ever had as a kid was in a musical in the Bowl when I was eight years old, so to close that loop is kind of a special milestone.
THC: You obviously have a musical theater background, and you can definitely hear it in a lot of the work that you do. I’m wondering how you see theater having influenced your music as you shifted more toward pop.
BP: Totally. I mean, I think storytelling is in both kinds of music. The fact that I came up in musical theater [means] I have no aversion to the narrative and emotional storytelling that that kind of music affords. I think that the best kept secret is that all pop music has a lot of that.… And, of course, the main thing that I’m afforded by doing my own music is getting to speak from my own perspective and share myself without the kind of artifice of a character and that layer of separation. So, I do love the opportunity to get to do both things, but I do think that they're a lot more closely intertwined than maybe people think.
THC: Shifting a little bit to your music, “Sing to Me Instead” was a very intimate album, filled with a sort of tension and heartbreak in a sort of indie style. I’m wondering how you see your music as having evolved in “Reverie.”
BP: I was just very much responding to where I was at as a person when I wrote each of these. I think the first album was coming fresh off of spending such a long time performing in the theater, and I think is a lot more closely related stylistically, in the sense that I'm very comfortable with, as you said, a more intimate, kind of acoustic feeling, when it came to the storytelling and the sonics of it. When I wrote the second album, I was living at home with my parents in the early pandemic, and was in need of, I think, a lot more of a stylistic escape, if you will. And I was listening to a lot of music that I listened to with my parents as a kid — a lot of Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel and James Taylor, and just feeling very inspired by a lot of that sound and the kind of dreaminess and escapism.
THC: You mention how you went back to your childhood home to write this album. I think, for a lot of queer kids, this is a weird place because now, as an adult, you’re out, and you’re returning to a childhood home where perhaps you weren’t or maybe you’re still trying to figure things out. Did it feel weird going back to that childhood space? What was going through your head, and did any of that make it into the album?
BP: Absolutely. I think that I felt very caught between these reminders of the past and who I was as a kid and the nostalgia of that. And then, you know, feeling like many people did during the pandemic, the most mature that I’d ever felt. And I was in a new relationship with Noah, who is now my partner. I felt so deeply different than who that person was, and then at the same time getting back in touch with them. I think the kind of push and pull, of being in the middle of those two things, is thematically a lot of where that album comes from.
THC: A lot of our readers are college students, many of whom are artists who are trying to figure things out for themselves. Any advice for people who want to get into music, or pursue their art?
BP: That's a tough one. I think that the first piece of advice I would give is the one my parents always have given to me, which is: If there's anything else you can imagine doing, or that could bring you fulfillment, and that you could get passionate about — then maybe do that. But also, to try to keep hold of what it is about it that you love and that makes you happy. Because by virtue of the way that the business is right now, there’s a lot of other elements that are very time consuming, and are necessary to kind of build yourself out as an artist. But I think it's important that, even in the midst of all that, that kind of noise on the outside, just to keep your eye on what it is that you love, and the reason that you're doing it.
Platt’s tour kicked off on Sept. 3 at the Wamu Theater in Seattle. He will be performing at the Agganis Arena in Boston on Sept. 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two New York Times Bestsellers already under their belt, author Casey McQuiston’s latest book released to much anticipation. In “I Kissed Shara Wheeler,” McQuiston’s latest foray into the world of young adult romance, readers meet another set of couples grappling with much of the same challenges as those in “One Last Stop” (2021) and “Red, White & Royal Blue” (2019). Indeed, McQuiston’s characters often find themselves isolated in new, strange places (which could be towns, countries, even timelines) and are lucky enough to find someone who changes everything for them, for better and worse. Also integral to these plot points is how these places help McQuiston’s characters learn more about their identities.
“I Kissed Shara Wheeler” follows protagonist Chloe Green, who moves to Alabama and is one of the only students at her intensely Catholic high school who is openly queer. She makes it her singular goal to become valedictorian, her only real competition being the most popular girl at school, Shara Wheeler. However, Shara — who bears a striking resemblance to Sara Cameron from Netflix’s “Outer Banks” (down to the iconic upturned lip) — spices things up when she makes out with Chloe in the elevator and then stages her own disappearance, leaving Chloe to team up with her classic-jock boyfriend and her obsessed-with-the-girl-next-door/bad boy neighbor to solve the mystery. The entire adventure is very Pretty-Little-Liars-esque, complete with little pink slips and spicy blackmail. But things take a turn when the plot line switches to a double enemies-to-lovers trope, where jock falls for bad boy and prom queen realizes her feelings for long-time academic rival.
Although it sounds funny to boil things down to TV show references, it’s fairly fitting of McQuiston’s writing style — jam packed with allusions to everything from “The Legend of Korra” to Taco Bell to Timothée Chalamet. McQuiston’s use of pop culture and clichés not only gives the book a ‘teen movie’ feel, but it adds to their witty and comedic writing: “Like, what do hot guys with long dark hair have to be that upset about? Get a clarifying shampoo and suck it up, Kylo Ren.”
The big idea that the two core romances in the story (as well as some of the side romances between other unlikely couples) reflect is that all of the characters seem to use the pressure of their schools’ expectations as well as their ‘misdirected’ rivalries with one another to hide their true selves and honest feelings. And, in the end, they realize that the true villains are not each other but the stigma and pressure against queerness from their town. While McQuiston weaves this into the storyline seamlessly, their characters have a tendency to state the themes a little too obviously in dialogue. For instance, Shara’s ex-boyfriend Smith goes into nearly a page of monologue: “It’s fucked up how they make us feel about ourselves, and we put up with it because we don’t think we can do anything about it. We put up with it for so long that we don’t even know who we are, only what they want us to be.” Or better, when Chloe blurts things like “God, you’re such a narcissist, I don’t even feel bad that you’re in love with me.” But, of course, being that McQuiston is careful to keep Chloe’s frankness and Smith’s tendency for soliloquy to their respective designs, it can all be chalked up to characterization.
What McQuiston does most beautifully in “I Kissed Shara Wheeler” is provide the reader with exactly what they ask for when they pick up a romantic comedy. In between all the laughs, high school cliques, master plans, teenage antics, crawling through vents, and falling off of yachts, readers experience two characters falling in love and grappling with what it means to be in love and what some of their first sexual experiences are supposed to look like. That, in itself, deserves applause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My time at and before Harvard has been defined by goals. Academic. Athletic. Personal. There is no path to a hyper-selective college like Harvard that does not demand constant self-appraisal. In high school, I routinely assessed how impressive my goals were and how they might measure up to those of other applicants. The ability to become my own admissions officer may have helped me get into Harvard — yet, upon entering Harvard’s gates, this tendency lingers so powerfully that at times I forget to live my life for myself.
This is why from now on, I will be driven by only one goal: to feel good.
Such a goal might seem trivial, but during my freshman spring, this state of being was not a given for me. After contracting Covid-19 in February, I developed an array of maladies that persisted for months, including loss of concentration, headache, and depression. Even before these symptoms, life at Harvard had often felt overwhelming; perpetually feeling physically unwell only made matters worse. When I recall my most recent semester at Harvard, the harder moments come to mind first: being hopelessly bedridden, drowning in schoolwork, and crying… a lot.
If I dig a little deeper, though, other memories begin to surface, much brighter in color and lighter in weight. I rejoice in the new friends I made during the spring and the older friendships that strengthened. I think of the special moments I had with the many people I came to love: eating BerryLine by the river, dancing in the rain on Widener steps, placing second in an international a cappella competition with the Opportunes. I remember conversations I had with people I knew I could lean on — late nights spent sharing little pieces of ourselves with each other, one fragment at a time.
When I allow myself to focus on these memories, the good ones, they come crashing down like waves, their foam concealing darker times hidden beneath the surface. But can we strive to feel good all the time by merely allowing goodness to wash over the negative?
In any place, but especially at Harvard, I would say that idea is unrealistic, fraught with traces of toxic positivity — a mindset characterized by “dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy.” Although appealing in theory, an attitude of toxic positivity avoids deep engagement with emotional struggles, leaving one unable to grapple with difficult emotions that will inevitably turn up again later on.
That's the thing about the ocean: as the tides change and currents shift, the depths of the seafloor churn to the surface. Life will stir up your world whether you’re ready for it or not. You can't escape feeling bad sometimes.
At Harvard, feeling bad has become endemic. From 2014 to 2018, nearly one in three Harvard undergraduates reported that they have or think they may have depression and anxiety. This was before the coronavirus pandemic triggered a 25 percent increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide and an even worse mental health crisis on our campus.
In such a pressure-filled environment, it can be really hard to feel good. The average Harvard student overworks, undersleeps, and finds themselves hard-pressed to choose between academic excellence and social satisfaction. Desiring to appear “successful,” many act like they have it all together, though few actually do.
One part of the problem is our narrative around success, which often focuses on end results rather than the journey to them. When we define success by grades, internships, or awards, we rely too heavily on external metrics for fulfillment, abandoning our internal selves in the pursuit. Our daily experiences become stale and difficult to appreciate: we rush walks to class, allow passions to fade into obligations, and let precious time spent with friends become transactional and stressful. Entrapped by a constant need to optimize, we take a backseat in our own lives. We become sick. We feel bad.
This semester, I’m redefining success to revolve around feeling good, if only by slowing down just enough to appreciate all the good that is already around me. I want to seek out moments that bring me joy: dancing on the Quad lawn, singing with the Opportunes, and laughing with my friends. I want to sleep a little more, stress a little less, and redirect my thoughts towards gratitude as much as possible. I want to fill my ocean up with as much love and appreciation as I can, while I can.
That doesn’t mean ignoring the bad. When life at Harvard inevitably sends the waters churning, bringing tough emotions to the surface, I want to meet them with more self-compassion and give myself more grace.
You can’t strive to feel good all the time through focusing on the positive. It would be exhausting to try. But perhaps feeling bad gives us an opportunity to feel good about the way we can care for ourselves — to appreciate our capacity to direct kindness inwards in the same way we project it out. If I could do this consistently, that would be all the success I need.
I feel good just thinking about it.

Andrew J. Berry received an undergraduate degree in zoology from Oxford University and a PhD in evolutionary genetics from Princeton before arriving at Harvard as a Junior Fellow. He is now a lecturer on Organismic & Evolutionary Biology and the Assistant Head Tutor of Integrative Biology.
This interview has been edited for clarity.
FM: So, what brought you into evolutionary genetics?
AJB: All sorts of factors — it was sort of a conspiracy, actually. My father was this academic scientist. My mother was a medic. So there was biology at home. In the typical, if ghastly, British bourgeois fashion, I was taken out of my natal home and plunked into a boarding school at the age of 13. The school, curiously enough, was Charles Darwin’s high school, so I took science in the Darwin buildings. I had a truly inspirational biology teacher back then. He had made it his business to become an expert in Darwinian thinking. You might say [it was] weirdly over-determined; I had to become an evolutionary biologist of some kind.
FM: What’s the most fascinating evolutionary innovation you’ve either studied or encountered?
AJB: Atavisms, which are traits that are not present in a contemporary organism but were present way back up that organism’s family tree. Here’s a famous example: A whale off Vancouver in the Northern Pacific had two symmetrical appendages sticking out from its rear sides — legs. What’s happened? There was this famous moment about 375 million years ago when [our ancestors] got out of the water, and we got tetrapods and eventually, amphibians and reptiles and mammals. Then, you got a bunch of lineages that decided to go back to the water. The atavism is something that might be a mutation, might be a developmental anomaly, [in which] the signal that suppresses the production of the hind limbs has failed.
FM: Why do evolutionary questions matter to you? 
AJB: The evolutionary process is the most beguiling, interesting, and important feature of all biology because it touches everything. You might be a cancer biologist interested in why the cell cycle has been corrupted by particular mutations. But where did that cell cycle that’s been corrupted come from? It evolved. And what do cancers do? They evolve as you try to hit them with drugs. [Studying evolution] is, in a sense, an excuse to study everything.
FM: Your early research focused on adaptive evolution within a particular chromosome of the Drosophila genome — what did this work find?
AJB: We were interested in how we [could] identify the action of positive Darwinian natural selection in DNA. Most natural selection is negative: a new mutation arises, it breaks something that works, [selection] just eliminates it. But what about innovation? That’s positive natural selection, where a new mutation arises and it actually makes the bird fly faster or the whale swim faster. How do we identify those events? A large proportion of the changes are random; they don’t matter. You can’t formally distinguish them between random and adaptive evolution, except in situations where you’ve got a lack of recombination in that region of DNA. Say I’ve got this new beneficial mutation on it. It’s not just the beneficial mutation which will go to 100 percent [in the population]; it’s the entire chunk of chromosome. In fruit flies, chromosome four very seldom undergoes recombination, so it was a good candidate to look for evidence of this “selective sweep.”
And lo and behold, we looked at a particular gene and [found] there were no mutational differences in this huge chunk of DNA across the entire species of Drosophila melanogaster. That tells you that there must have been a selective sweep for an adaptive mutation somewhere on that chromosome. Now [these tools for detecting selective sweeps] are very standard in human genetics.
FM: You arrived at Harvard as a researcher, but nowadays, you dedicate your time to teaching. Why did you make this transition?
AJB: As a postdoc, I met lots of interesting people and had lots of great conversations. But I was never that excited about being in a molecular biology lab. The question was [whether] there was a way I could be involved with science without spending all day pipetting. And it’s pretty addictive, teaching, especially teaching at Harvard, because you get to walk into a room with a lot of smart people who are forced to listen to you. It’s an opportunity to try and convince other people that what you think is important is important.
FM: You help teach one of the largest classes on campus — Life Sciences 1b. What are the particular rewards and challenges that come with teaching at that scale?
AJB: One challenge is it’s sort of depressingly impersonal. The second thing is it’s not my course. [The class] is a prerequisite for basically all the life sciences, so there’s a committee which essentially decides what the content is, and my job is to execute that. That’s not super sexy. The big positive, however, [is that] first-years are qualitatively different from upperclassmen. First-years have not had the enthusiasm kicked out of them. They are just brilliantly engaged and excited and fun to talk to.
FM: What sorts of questions get you out of bed in the morning these days?
AJB: It’s my job to stay on top of what’s happening in science. I can’t just recycle lectures from 20 years ago, so what gets me out of bed is the opportunity to figure out what I should be adding in the next iteration of course X, Y, or Z. That, and the prospect of breakfast.
FM: How would you say your approach to teaching has evolved over time?
AJB: I’ve become more sensitive to the fact that I have one great virtue as a teacher, which is I’m pretty dumb. No, seriously, I’m not only at your level, I am probably slightly below it. So if it’s a complicated idea, I might struggle to understand it. But because I’m struggling to understand it, that means I have to unpack it and lay it out in a way that a complete moron — I’m looking at you, Andrew Berry — can understand it, which turns out to be pretty good for introductory courses.
FM: You like to integrate the history of science into your classes. What value do you think comes from learning about the people and the stories behind the science?
AJB: I believe humans are wired to tell and hear stories. The trouble with a lot of science instruction is there’s no story there. There are all sorts of ways [storytelling] can work in class. If there’s a whole set of experiments that build on each other, that’s a great story arc.
The other way is to incorporate personal stories. We can just dive in and talk about Mendelian genetics, but it’s much more engaging if you can think about Friar Mendel. He tried to take this exam which would qualify him to be a teacher and failed it twice, which is already a wonderful, teachable moment, right? Some of the greatest scientific breakthroughs have been done by people that are on the side, or serendipitously.
FM: You have a particularly strong interest in the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace. Tell me more about him. Why do you find him so compelling?
AJB: Wallace is somebody who’s sort of famous for not being famous. The reason Darwin published “The Origin of Species” was that he got this letter from this nobody 14 years younger than him who was out collecting specimens in the rainforests of Southeast Asia: Wallace. Wallace sent Darwin a letter in which he basically described Darwin’s theory. Darwin panics, and he and his senior colleagues save face by having the two scientists co-publish a paper in 1858. Then Darwin immediately pumps out “The Origin of Species,” partly to establish his precedent — he’s been working on this idea for a long time. When you Google “evolution,” what do you see? It’s that luxurious, big forehead of Darwin. What happened to Wallace? You might think he was a one-hit wonder. No, he did all sorts of incredibly important science. He was an amazingly progressive thinker.
FM: What common misconception about evolution do you most wish you could dispel?
AJB: The premise that you either believe in evolution or you believe in God. What I want people to be comfortable with is that these are not formally incompatible worldviews. What they are are different worldviews which don’t really overlap. Science is about observation, experiment. Religion is accessed through faith. You’ve got two different ways of viewing the world. They’re both equally valid.
FM: Can you forecast how the human genome might change over time? 
AJB: No, not really. Natural selection [depends on] the interaction between the environment and the genome. So if there’s variation for the ability to run fast, and there’s a lot of lions in your neighborhood, then you’ll have natural selection in favor of running fast. You might say, can we predict future environments? I would say no. It’s very difficult to predict anything.
FM: What selective pressures exist at the moment?
AJB: There are people who will tell you that natural selection isn’t occurring in human populations. I’d point to the fact that diseases that used to kill us, no longer kill us. If I’ve got Type 1 diabetes, I’m perfectly capable of having kids and passing on my genes that probably predispose me to Type 1 diabetes. And, hello, COVID. I bet COVID is exercising a pretty major selective event. There’s no question that evolution under natural selection is still going on. Where we’ll end up, I’ll let you figure that out.
FM: Have you noticed any interesting ways that Harvard students have “evolved” to survive this arguably harsh environment?
AJB: Well, no is the answer. It’s actually an unfortunate piece of linguistic confusion. When I as an evolutionary biologist talk about adaptation, I’m talking about the fact that the Galapagos finches’ bills are perfectly adapted to eat the right size of seeds, and so on. But a neuroscientist, when they talk about adaptation, is talking about a plastic response of the body to accommodate the environment. There’s tons of that that occurs in Harvard students. I mean, it’s an extraordinary social experiment we run every year, putting a bunch of valedictorians together. That’s an enormous amount of social stress and friction, but the human mentality is such that it quickly adapts appropriately. We have all these brilliant people who could rub each other [wrong] — and sometimes do of course — but more often really pull together for the common good.
FM: You deliver the annual Bulldog Roast for Harvard-Yale, but if you could roast Harvard instead, what would you say?
AJB: It would be a four-hour roast just talking about my.harvard, which is the single worst piece of IT infrastructure in existence. It’s extraordinary that a major academic institution should be brought to its knees at the beginning of every semester because my.harvard doesn’t work. But the sad news is, we can make jokes about Harvard and roast it, but it’s never going to be as easy as roasting Yale, which is woefully inadequate on so many fronts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 2, 2022, at 5:17 a.m.
A federal judge on Thursday rejected Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber’s request for a new trial or an acquittal, another legal blow to the embattled research chemist who was convicted last year of lying to the government about his ties to a Chinese government-run recruitment program.
United States District Court Judge Rya W. Zobel ’53 denied Lieber’s request in an order released Thursday afternoon, rebuffing arguments made by his lawyers, who said his conviction was a “manifest injustice.”
Attorneys for Lieber argued before Zobel in March that the scientist’s statement to Department of Defense investigators saying he “wasn’t sure” how China categorized him was literally true because he could not know China’s state of mind.
Zobel rejected the argument on Thursday, citing Lieber’s emails discussing a Thousand Talents Program contract and his post-arrest interview with the FBI.
“The decisive issue was Defendant’s state of mind, not China’s,” Zobel wrote in her decision Thursday, adding that the evidence presented at trial “was sufficient for a jury to find literal falsity of the statements as charged.”
Lieber’s attorneys also claimed there was insufficient evidence he had intentionally avoided reporting his foreign bank account containing money received through the TTP. Zobel denied the contention, noting that at trial, Lieber’s accountant testified he sent the professor letters on the reporting requirement, which Lieber signed.
“On this evidence, the jury could find that Defendant knew about the reporting requirement for calendar year 2014 and willfully failed to meet it,” Zobel wrote.
Zobel also rejected the claim that the court had not properly instructed the jury, writing that Lieber’s attorneys did not object to the instructions before deliberation took place.
The Thursday decision reaffirmed an October 2021 court order allowing Lieber’s post-arrest FBI interview to be admitted as evidence in the case. In the interview, Lieber told agents he “wasn’t completely transparent” with DOD investigators previously. Lieber’s attorneys contended the video of the interview should not have been presented to jurors, asserting that investigators ignored Lieber’s request for an attorney.
Lieber is now scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 11, 2023, just over one year after a jury convicted him on all six felony charges brought by federal prosecutors. Lieber could receive up to 26 years in prison and up to $1.2 million in fines.
“We are disappointed by the Court’s decision, but we’re not giving up the fight,” Lieber’s lead defense attorney, Marc L. Mukasey, wrote in a statement Thursday.
Lieber did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Last month, hundreds of Harvard students emerged from the New England wilderness having completed, for the first time since 2019, the First-Year Outdoor Program outdoors.
One of six pre-orientation programs offered by the College, FOP sees more than 450 incoming freshmen, led by upperclassmen, take to the outdoors to forge new friendships through games, traditions, and team-building exercises. The program was held virtually in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Many of “FOPpers” lauded the return of the original format of the program, citing new friendships and thrilling experiences.
“I did FOP because I wanted to meet students ahead of time, before orientation started, and I met some of my best friends on the trip,” Olivia G. Callander ’26 said. “I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.”
Lauren M. Teichholtz ’26, a New Yorker who had never backpacked prior to the program, said FOP presented an opportunity to leave her comfort zone.
“I had an amazing time, and almost everyone I've talked to also had an amazing time, no matter their background,” Teichholtz said. “I think FOP is fun for everyone.”
According to some participants, the tribulations of a week outdoors are what make FOP connections so special.
“With the conditions that you’re under, spending six days under a tarp in the backcountry, you learn a lot more about a person than you would spending six days with them on campus,” Elizabeth M. Crawford ’26 said. “You’re just immediately very vulnerable and just feel very comfortable being your true self.”
“You might be hungry and kind of tired, but it lowers the barriers for conversation,” Teichholtz said.
Even adverse weather was appreciated.
“We got caught in some rain, but it also made us closer as a group, trying to overcome the challenges of the trip,” Callander said. “I wouldn’t have wanted to miss it.”
Upperclassman leaders, who spearheaded each expedition in pairs, also reported enthusiasm about the program’s return.
“I think the biggest challenge in virtual FOP was trying to still create the group and the sense of community despite not being able to spend the entire time in person,” FOP leader Nicole J. Bugliosi ’24 said. “It’s not the same as being in the woods all together, 24/7.”
Still, the program needed to overcome a gap in institutional memory, a task Bugliosi said fell upon FOP veterans.
“We luckily had a lot of seniors and super seniors who led FOP trips,” she said. “They were really good about sharing that knowledge.”
If there were growing pains, the freshman FOPpers didn’t notice.
“I think among all of my friends, everyone had raving reviews about their leaders,” Crawford said. “Nothing really went awry when it could have.”
“This was a whole new experience,” Callander said. “I really enjoyed every minute of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was only the second day of class, but Sabrina M. “Rezzy” Reznik ’25 estimated she had visited El Jefe’s Taqueria “three or four times” since arriving on campus for the fall semester.
El Jefe’s, which has been a student hotspot since it opened in Harvard Square in 2015, relocated this August to a new storefront in the newly renovated Abbot building.
While the lines at new El Jefe’s move faster than it did at the old location, according to Reznik, “it doesn’t have the same ambiance that old Jefe’s did.”
“It’s the nostalgia,” Reznik said. “It’s walking in every time and remembering all the moments that you remember and more so, the moments you can’t remember — and enjoying that.”
The new location, which straddles Brattle Street and John F. Kennedy Street, lies just around the corner from its former location at The Garage, a longtime shopping mall in the Square.
The new space, which spans two floors and almost twice the square footage of its previous location, also offers increased menu options. El Jefe’s added al pastor steak as a new meat option when it opened in August, and the restaurant intends to apply for a full liquor license to serve frozen margaritas.
Many students said they enjoyed the new location, citing its spaciousness compared to the previous venue.
“It’s bigger, it’s less chaotic,” said Debjani “Debby” Das ’24, a Crimson Arts editor. “The main street has CVS and all the other stores anyway, so I feel like it’s more convenient.”
But for Reznik, part of her nostalgia for the old location is how hectic it would get late at night.
“It’s just the chaos and the excitement of not knowing if your burrito is going to be right,” she said. “Standing in that line and the classic ‘will Tasty Burger be faster’ debate — and it never is. ”
Several students said though the quality of the food remains unchanged, El Jefe’s signature late-night ambiance has disappeared with the old storefront.
“I don’t think the food’s any different, but I do think the atmosphere is different,” said senior Justin Y. C. Wong ’22. “Seems a bit more touristy than college — but I’ll still come.”
El Jefe’s regional manager Jon Eller said in an interview last month the taqueria left its venue in the Garage, which is slated to begin major renovations in the coming months, due to the prospect of shutting down while the shopping mall completed construction.
Samuel Y. Ho ’22-’23, who said he preferred El Jefe’s former location, said he may frequent Felipe’s Taqueria — a Mexican restaurant on the other side of Brattle Street — due to the proximity of the two restaurants since El Jefe’s relocation.
“Since I was in Eliot House, at least mentally, it seemed closer to go to Jefe’s,” Ho said. “Now, I think I’d be open to go into Felipe’s just as much.”
Other students felt indifference about the store’s relocation.
Lena M. Tinker ’25 said she believed the new space is “beautiful” but the location has not significantly changed her routine.
“It’s really half a block away,” said Tinker, a Crimson Arts editor. “For me, it doesn’t make that much of a difference. If I want to go, it’s late at night, whatever it is — it’s still right there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through much of 2020 and 2021, Lilia M. Kilburn, an Anthropology Ph.D. candidate at Harvard, worked closely with the University’s Office of Dispute Resolution, which was investigating a sexual harassment complaint she filed against professor John L. Comaroff.
By January 2022, further Harvard investigations concluded Comaroff had violated the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay subsequently levied sanctions against the professor.
Now, months after the investigations have ended, ODR’s fact-finding process remains mired in controversy.
Kilburn and two other graduate students, Margaret G. Czerwienski and Amulya Mandava, filed a lawsuit against Harvard in February alleging the school ignored years of sexual harassment by Comaroff. In new filings submitted in July and August, Harvard and the plaintiffs sparred over whether Kilburn gave consent to the school to obtain and distribute her therapy notes to Comaroff during its investigation.
In the tenth count of the suit, the plaintiffs claim Harvard violated Massachusetts privacy laws by failing to obtain Kilburn’s written consent for the access, use, and disclosure of Kilburn’s therapy records.
The University holds that Kilburn encouraged ODR investigators to contact her therapist and obtain those notes.
During its investigation into Kilburn’s complaint against Comaroff, ODR was given her therapy records from her private therapist. The records were later distributed to Comaroff, his legal team, faculty members on Harvard’s appeal committee, the University’s Office for Gender Equity, and deans as part of ODR's final report.
The suit alleges that Comaroff used the therapy notes to “gaslight” Kilburn by “claiming that she must have imagined that he sexually harassed her” because of her post-traumatic stress disorder; however, the suit claims she developed PTSD as a result of his harassment of her.
Over the summer, the University asked U.S. District Court Judge Judith G. Dein to rule in its favor with a summary judgment on the tenth count.
In a memorandum supporting its motion for partial summary judgment, the University claims Kilburn provided her therapist’s information to ODR and told the office that her therapist “should have” some “notes or memories” for investigators. The school maintains that before Kilburn steered investigators to her therapist, ODR notified her “no fewer than seven times” that evidence obtained in an investigation would be shared with Comaroff as part of usual ODR proceedings.
On Aug. 23, the plaintiffs opposed Harvard’s motion, arguing that exhibits submitted by the University show Harvard lacked evidence of written consent from Kilburn. They further argued that the University based its argument on an “ambiguous” verbal statement from Kilburn.
According to a memorandum in support of Harvard’s motion by ODR investigator Ilissa A. Povich, she emailed Kilburn several documents outlining the Harvard’s sexual harassment policies and investigative procedures at the start of the investigation.
After Kilburn asked for clarification on the policies, Jessica L. Shaffer, an ODR staff member at the time, responded in an email that both parties would have “the right to review and respond to all information that ODR may rely on in the investigation.”
In an affidavit, Kilburn wrote she did not get “straightforward” answers after asking how ODR “would determine whether it ‘may rely’” on certain information for its conclusion, she wrote.
Per Kilburn’s affidavit, Comaroff stated in his August 2020 response to Kilburn’s ODR complaint that he believed the “substantial emotional distress” he observed in Kilburn was brought on “for reasons unrelated” to him. Kilburn maintains she decided to involve her therapist in the investigation in order to prove to ODR that her emotional distress “largely” stemmed from his alleged harassment of her.
According to the affidavit, Kilburn emailed her therapist on Aug. 20, 2020, asking if she “might have notes from our sessions that mention” the misconduct she described experiencing from Comaroff. The therapist said she offered to write up “a brief statement acknowledging that we talked about sexual harassment by professors in your department” and the effects it had on Kilburn.
Days later, Kilburn submitted a response to ODR saying her therapist could attest to having conversations about Comaroff’s alleged behavior.
“She is currently on vacation, but I believe she has specific memories of our conversations about misconduct in my department, my concerns about the damage Professor Comaroff could do to my career, and my repeated and unfruitful attempts to get assistance,” she wrote. “She is ready to attest to this when she returns from vacation.”
During an interview ODR conducted with Kilburn on Aug. 28, 2020, Kilburn told ODR that the therapist “should have a bunch of notes or memories for you,” according to ODR’s notes of the conversation.
ODR explained to Kilburn during the interview the process and criteria for including witnesses for investigators to contact, adding that it asks “every single witness if they have documents that are relevant, which we share with you,” per ODR’s notes.
Kilburn, however, wrote in her affidavit that she did not take ODR’s statements during the interview to mean that ODR would seek to obtain records from her therapist. Rather, she assumed the investigators would only ask the therapist whether or not such records existed.
Povich’s affidavit claims that following the interview, Kilburn sent her therapist’s name and email as a witness for ODR to contact. The witnesses’ names and information are redacted in the email from Kilburn that Harvard submitted to the court.
Kilburn noted in her affidavit that she had originally planned to review any relevant materials or statements from her therapist “before deciding whether to submit them to ODR.” But she did not contact her therapist after listing her as a witness.
“I wanted to reach out to my therapist myself, but because I believed that ODR would consider this an improper communication and discredit my therapist’s account, I did not reach out to her,” she wrote.
Povich wrote that she and Shaffer interviewed Kilburn’s counselor in October 2020, and that Shaffer explained to the therapist that ODR would share with both Comaroff and Kilburn any relevant information learned during the interview.
The therapist shared during the interview that she received an email from Kilburn over the summer “asking if I had documentation about what we talked about often,” according to the ODR’s redacted notes of the interview.
Shaffer then asked the therapist if she was willing to provide that documentation, adding that documents sent by the therapist would be shared with both parties if the investigators “think we might rely on it.”
“In transmitting via email I need to comply with HIPAA,” the therapist responded, according to the notes. “I can’t write her whole name. I will change the name of the file.”
The therapist agreed to send entries from two therapy sessions that occured March 2019. ODR then shared redacted versions of the records to Kilburn and Comaroff on Oct. 30, 2020.
Povich wrote in her affidavit that ODR only obtained therapy records from Kilburn’s therapist because Kilburn said her counselor should have notes for ODR and provided her counselor’s information.
“Under the circumstances, I believed that Ms. Kilburn’s therapist could speak to ODR and send ODR the two therapy notes the therapist selected without violating any obligation to Ms. Kilburn,” she wrote.
Kilburn did not complain about the notes at the time because she did not know Comaroff had also received them, according to her affidavit.
In January 2021, Povich met with Kilburn to verbally describe the evidence ODR gathered, as part of normal ODR proceedings. Povich read notes of ODR’s interview with Kilburn’s therapist and told her ODR would then review evidence with Comaroff, according to Povich. Povich wrote in her affidavit that Kilburn did not object to ODR sharing information from witnesses with Comaroff.
Kilburn, however, wrote in her own affidavit that she “felt very upset” at the time upon discovering that ODR and the therapist had discussed the contents of her therapy sessions.
“I had not anticipated that ODR would interview my therapist about the contents of what I shared with her during our sessions,” she wrote. “I was extremely overwhelmed, and did not know how to communicate to ODR that I was not comfortable with the extent to which they had interviewed my therapist.”
Kilburn wrote that she had not seen the unredacted contents of the March therapy notes that her therapist sent to ODR.
In May 2021, ODR emailed Kilburn a draft report containing its findings, noting, “The documents referenced in the draft Report were already provided by you or to you during the investigation, and will be attached as exhibits to the Final Report.”
Though the draft report listed that the two therapy notes from March 2019 had been obtained from a witness in the investigation, Kilburn wrote in her affidavit that the draft report “contained no discussion of the content of [her therapist’s] interview or the progress notes.”
“I concluded that ODR must not have relied on her progress notes or interview to draft the report and that they would therefore not be exhibits to the Final Report,” she wrote.
Kilburn maintains that she only knew that Comaroff had also received her therapy notes when she read Comaroff’s response to the draft report, which questioned her memory due to her PTSD diagnosis.
By the time Kilburn read Comaroff’s response in September 2021, ODR had already released the final report and the deadline for appealing the report had lapsed. Harvard’s Office of Gender Equity denied her request to send more information to the appeals panel.
Because Kilburn claims she never gave written authorization for the release of her medical records and did not intend for Harvard to share them with Comaroff, she argues Harvard violated her right to privacy.
In light of her confusion about what information from her therapist would be shared with ODR and subsequently Comaroff, Kilburn argues Harvard failed to obtain necessary consent from her to utilize and distribute her medical records, which the plaintiffs argue is written authorization.
Samuel Perkins ’70, an attorney based in Boston, wrote in an email that the current filings do not demonstrate that the therapist had authorization to release Kilburn’s medical records.
“ODR itself should have obtained a written confirmation from Ms. Kilburn that she had authorized the therapist to release the therapy notes,” he wrote. “The Kilburn statements Harvard cites at best imply that she may authorize the therapist to release information, but these fall far short of the required explicit permission.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
Ellen J. Messing ’72, an employment lawyer with experience handling sexual harassment cases, said written consent for the release of medical records ensures both parties are on the same page.
“People have different understandings of oral communication,” she said. “So the value of written consent is that it’s down there and it’s in black and white, nobody can say there’s some incoherence about the scope of what the patient is agreeing to.”
But Djuna Perkins, the co-founder of the Association of Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination Investigators of New England, said the onus is upon the therapist, not Harvard, to obtain authorization from the patient for the release of medical records.
In addition, she said she believed Harvard arguably had a “good faith belief” they had consent from Kilburn for obtaining her records.
“What’s the point of telling me that the therapist might have specific memories unless you’re also authorizing me to get those memories — whether or not it’s verbal or a written authorization?” she said.
All three experts agreed there seems to be a factual dispute between the plaintiffs and Harvard and that they expect the judge will likely deny Harvard’s motion for partial summary judgment in favor of entering discovery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Massachusetts voters set to head to the polls Tuesday for a statewide primary election, the Democratic race for attorney general has emerged as one of the most competitive contests in the state, with a pair of high-profile progressives seeking to replace Maura T. Healey ’92, who is running for governor.
Former Boston City Councilor Andrea J. Campbell is facing labor attorney Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, who has never held public office. Quentin Palfrey ’96, an attorney who served in the Obama and Biden administrations, suspended his campaign earlier this week and backed Campbell.
The race has divided the state’s Democratic establishment. Liss-Riordan earned high-profile endorsements from a slate of key elected officials earlier this week, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07. Healey and the state’s junior U.S. senator, Edward J. Markey, have both endorsed Campbell.
Attorney James McMahon is the only Republican in the race.
David Paleologos, a pollster who directs Suffolk University’s Political Research Center, said the endorsements have created a divide among progressive voters.
A poll released this week by the University of Massachusetts Lowell showed Campbell leading Liss-Riordan by 2 percentage points. But Paleologos cautioned that the recent wave of endorsements could change the course of the race.
“Part of Andrea Campbell’s advantage comes out of Suffolk County,” but the Wu endorsement “could be a big offset” in the area.
Healey, who has served as the state attorney general since 2015, has emerged as the de facto Democratic nominee after both of her primary opponents — Harvard professor Danielle S. Allen and State Senator Sonia R. Chang-Diaz — dropped out of the contest.
Republicans in the state will choose between former state representative Geoffrey G. Diehl, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and businessman Chris Doughty, who has positioned himself as a moderate alternative.
Polling has shown Diehl with a significant advantage in the primary — but long odds in a hypothetical general election matchup against Healey.
State Senator Eric P. Lesser ’07, State Representative Tami L. Gouveia, and Salem Mayor Kimberley Driscoll are all vying for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor.
Lesser, a former aide to President Obama, held an early fundraising advantage in the race. But at the Massachusetts Democratic Convention in June, Lesser came in third behind Gouveia and Driscoll. The UMass Lowell poll from earlier this month also showed Driscoll with a lead ahead of Lesser and Gouveia.
John G. Cluverius, an associate professor of political science at UMass Lowell, said “the smart money is probably on Driscoll,” but warned that the electorate in a primary election is “really volatile.”
Chris Dempsey, a graduate of Harvard Business School and former director of a transportation non-profit, is facing State Senator Diana DiZoglio in the Democratic primary for auditor. Dempsey, who won the party’s endorsement at the convention and has the backing of Wu and the state’s current auditor, Suzanne M. Bump, had a double-digit percentage lead over DiZoglio in the UMass Lowell poll.
Security expert Anthony Amore, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, is the only Republican candidate for auditor.
In the Democratic primary for Secretary of State, former NAACP of Boston President Tanisha Sullivan is challenging seven-term incumbent William F. Galvin. Sullivan has the backing of several high-profile progressives, including Danielle Allen and Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, but Galvin remains the favorite in the race, according to recent polling.
Conservative radio host Rayla Campbell is the only Republican candidate in the race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With campus back in full swing, public health experts said Harvard’s Covid-19 policies are reasonable for the moment, but called on University officials to remain prepared for the possibility of another surge.
Beginning last semester, Harvard relaxed its masking and testing protocols. Masks are encouraged but optional in most indoor settings and while students were required to take an antigen test upon returning to campus, the University will stop sponsoring optional PCR tests later this month.
Harvard University Health Services encouraged affiliates to take advantage of the eight free antigen tests available to them through their private insurance.
“Heading to school, you’re in a situation where things are generally in a good spot,” said John S. Brownstein, a professor at Harvard Medical School who serves as the chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. “But we have to anticipate the fact that it is possible that the school may have to pivot to bring back testing, bring back masking, depending on what the surveillance data is saying.”
Thomas N. Denny, Chief Operating Officer of Duke University’s Human Vaccine Institute, said that an uptick in positivity rates is likely as crowds convene more indoors as the weather cools.
“The virus will decide when it’s done with us, not when we’re done with it,” he said. “I would not be surprised if we saw some numbers increase over the fall and winter months — it’s just hard to know yet.”
Enrolled students are required to be up to date on their Covid-19 vaccinations, meaning that they must have received all doses in their primary series and subsequent boosters for which they were eligible as of the start of the calendar year.
As of August 31, 74 percent of all Cambridge residents were fully vaccinated.
On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authorized new Covid-19 boosters targeting more transmissible variants. Some experts said that more data is necessary to understand how to disseminate the vaccine to the public.
“We really don’t know enough about that booster to know what kind of recommendations should be made and how strongly those should be made,” said Harvard School of Public Health Adjunct Professor Eric J. Rubin ’80, who added that it is “very likely” that the booster is safe. “Until we know that, I think it’s really hard to set policies.”
When Harvard dropped its mask mandate in March, campus disability justice advocates voiced their concerns over the danger a mask-optional policy would pose to immunocompromised affiliates. While some health experts said those on campus must be mindful of the risk levels of others, they added that most protections will have to come from the practices of the individuals at risk.
“While we need to be respectful, there are also practical limits to what can be done,” Daniel R. Kuritzkes, the chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said. “You can’t require that an entire population be masked because a small fraction of that population is potentially vulnerable.”
Michael T. Osterholm, who served on President Joe Biden’s Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board, said that the United States has moved past stringent public health restrictions, making it difficult to reimplement them without serious pretext.
“What’s happening is that we’re seeing society’s decided, ‘We’re done with these [masks],’” said Olsterhom, who added that Covid-19 transmission remains “a real risk” to much of the American public.
Though he acknowledged policymaking around the pandemic is difficult, Massachusetts General Hospital infectious disease specialist Amir M. Mohareb said he’d appreciate more transparency about the “on ramps” that could trigger the return of Covid-19 restrictions.
“What I would like to see from the authorities who put this guidance together is what are the benchmarks at which more stringent testing and contact tracing — that which was previously done — is going to be reinstituted,” Mohareb said.
Should new Covid-19 variants arise, sound policy at the beginning of the semester may not be feasible in two months, Brownstein said.
“The pandemic has taught us that things can change very quickly,” he said. “People need to be flexible.”

Elizabeth C. “Liz” Hoveland ’22 brought concerns about former Leverett Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras to Harvard administrators four times between June 2020 and June 2021.
During the meetings, administrators from the Dean of Students Office advised Hoveland to wait to share her feedback with a review committee established to evaluate the couple — standard practice for faculty deans in their fourth year of a five-year appointment to determine if they should be renewed for another term.
The review committee spent months meeting with affiliates like Hoveland to understand the house environment. Though the committee’s findings were not publicly released, a few months later, Farrell and Ferreras abruptly announced they would step down at the end of June — a year before the scheduled end of their term.
The role of faculty dean, known as “house master” before 2016, is unique to Harvard College. Each pair of faculty deans oversees one of the school’s 12 upperclassman houses. The job involves administrative tasks — including hiring tutors and staff, dispensing a budget, and approving housewide events — but a significant part of the role is setting the house’s culture and traditions.
Farrell and Ferreras took over Leverett in fall 2018. A couple months after their arrival, the pair told The Crimson they were keeping up the house’s “strong traditions” and “actively building” Leverett’s Senior Common Room, a network of advisors and other affiliates who have access to the house and sometimes mentor students.
But a year later, many residents complained that some of the house’s most beloved traditions had disappeared and the SCR lay dormant. Discontent brewed on house email lists, where students bemoaned closed common spaces and shelved house traditions. That spring, students in Leverett circulated copies of a political cartoon depicting the faculty deans as the Standard Oil octopus.
In 2019, just 27 percent of graduating Leverett residents said they trusted Farrell and Ferreras in a Crimson survey — the lowest of any house. Their trust rating was 13 percentage points below the second-lowest rated faculty deans, whose contract in Winthrop House was not renewed by the College that year due to concerns about the house culture.
In interviews conducted with 48 current and former Leverett residents, tutors, and staff over the past six months, many said the house’s culture suffered after Farrell and Ferreras arrived. Thirteen Leverett affiliates said the faculty deans fostered a toxic atmosphere in the house, marked by mismanagement and distrust.
Though many students and staff shared positive experiences, others in the house said traditions and good will withered under Farrell and Ferreras as senior staff turned over at a high rate. Some sources spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about their job security at Harvard or fear of retaliation from Farrell and Ferreras.
In a May statement to The Crimson before they announced their departure, Farrell and Ferreras said the criticisms are not representative of the house culture they fostered, instead describing a “vibrant, happy, friendly, welcoming atmosphere” different from the one they inherited.
“We have done everything we can to dismantle what was a toxic, topdown and paternalistic work environment upon our arrival that was bad for the community,” they wrote.
They added that several of the criticisms were levied by those who have “privately and publicly harassed” them and are “accompanied with lightly-veiled intersectional sexism and racism” toward Ferreras, who is Latinx. The pair wrote they previously “heard and refuted” many of the allegations, which they claim originated from a “very small group of people.”
Still, a number of current and former staff and residents allege that the pattern of mismanagement Farrell and Ferreras introduced was widespread.
“When I met with the [review] committee, and I told them my issues, I cried,” Hoveland said. “And they said, ‘We believe you. Your complaints echo what we’ve been hearing in all of our interviews.’ That was the moment that I was like, ‘I’m not alone in this.’”
Farrell and Ferreras entered Leverett as successors to Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi, who announced their resignation after 20 years in 2018.
Nicholas J. Durham ’20 described the Georgis as “really approachable and warm” and recalled eating Leverett’s homemade monkey bread during their weekly open house events.
The Georgis left “pretty big shoes to fill,” said former Leverett resident Philippe Noel ’20.
Under Farrell and Ferreras, some beloved Leverett traditions — including a faculty dean open house serving monkey bread, a weekly “Physics Night” to work on homework in the dining hall, and a frequent social called Not Just Sherry Hour — did not survive.
In the May statement, the pair wrote that monkey bread was discontinued due to a student’s allergies and they modified Not Just Sherry Hour into Social Hour, which they described as “very successful.” Physics Night, Farrell and Ferreras wrote, drew complaints for rendering the house’s dining hall “largely unavailable.” After the two rescheduled the event, the Physics Night professor moved it to a different house which resulted in the end of the tradition, they claimed.
“It was really their way or the highway. They were not receptive to student feedback,” said former House Committee chair Benjamin I. Sorkin ’20. “It was very much their vision for the house rather than what the house had been like before.”
Five students and staff said Farrell and Ferreras often made decisions without input from students or staff.
During their second year, students noticed the house’s Senior Common Room, private dining room, art room, and kitchen were locked. Access to the Junior Common Room became restricted to Leverett students only, and its piano was locked shut.
Following a 27-message housewide email chain criticizing these changes to Leverett in 2019, a group of students documented their grievances in a five-page Google Doc, deploring the closure of common spaces and a lack of regular house events.
“To this day, I’ve never seen the inside of the private dining room nor the Senior Common Room,” Garrett M. Rolph ’22 said in a March interview.
In their statement to The Crimson, the faculty deans said tutors can book Leverett’s private dining room and SCR for meetings, including those attended by students. The art room and student kitchen can be reserved by students who complete a training, they wrote.
Despite some student complaints, some Leverett residents reported positive experiences with the faculty deans.
“The deans are great,” Jacob P. Winter ’24 said. “They feel personable. I can approach them and talk to them like I would a teacher.”
“They’re extremely supportive and they create a very warm environment,” Abigail R. White ’24 said.
Still, other house residents told a different story, alleging that Ferreras was hostile to students in Leverett common spaces.
Suriya Kandaswamy ’20 recalled an incident during which Ferreras began “screaming” at students in Leverett’s art room, threatening to revoke access to the space after students had not cleaned up.
“We’re not children,” Kandaswamy said. “It’s one thing to take away our access if we’re not following the rules but to come and scream at everyone in front of everyone — it’s a little bit demeaning.”
A former resident tutor said Ferreras on occasion raised her voice to students, particularly around the dining hall.
“The students I talked to were just so hurt and sometimes would come up to us in tears,” the tutor said. “It was a constant battle where she would just chase people and scream at them to put away all their dirty dishes.”
Two students said they witnessed a specific instance in which Ferreras loudly rebuked a student in the dining hall.
The former faculty deans denied the allegations, writing that Ferreras has “never yelled at any community member.”
“It is unconscionable to think that she would yell at a student in the Dining Hall, or in the art room, or at any location or occasion, and it would be surprising, especially given the level of scrutiny we have been under, that this would have happened and remained unaddressed in the moment it happened,” the pair wrote.
At Leverett’s virtual thesis showcase in 2021, Farrell misgendered students despite repeated verbal and written attempts by attendees to correct him, according to four students and staff who attended the event.
“There’s definitely a lack of respect in the house — a lack of respect about referring to people as they want to be referred to,” said Alyx Britton ’21, who attended the event.
In their May statement to The Crimson, the faculty deans said they “deeply regret this incident” and are “sincerely sorry for this mistake.”
“We discussed this incident after the fact and how to make sure that all student’s pronouns are known and respected, and [Farrell] apologized at that time to the students and to the tutors who managed the event,” they wrote.
Two years into his time as a resident tutor in Leverett, John L. Pulice III ’15 said he suffered a breakdown due to what he described as the faculty deans’ “constant pattern of micromanagement, undercutting, and unprofessional behavior.”
Pulice, who began at Leverett in 2018, said he was immediately given a “massive” number of responsibilities on top of advising residents, including handling the House’s website, mailing lists, and room reservations.
In early 2021, Pulice triggered a College inquiry into the faculty deans, according to an email exchange with Dean of Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba. In a 19-page statement submitted to administrators, Pulice said he was forced to shoulder the blame for decisions made by the faculty deans and burdened with more work than other tutors.
“It is impossible to succeed in this house,” Pulice wrote. “Being a tutor in Leverett House is an act of constant denigration, capitulation, and coddling of leadership that are completely unfit and unqualified to hold this position.”
His concerns weren’t anomalous: six other current and former staff members said their mental health deteriorated under the leadership of Farrell and Ferreras. Eleven students and staff said the faculty deans micromanaged them.
In their statement to The Crimson, Ferreras and Farrell described a “strong working relationship” with the house tutors, citing their creation of “tutor committees” to distribute work equitably and provide tutors agency.
Over the pair’s tenure, staff meetings occasionally devolved into shouting matches, according to six current and former staff members. Farrell and Ferreras denied the allegations.
“We do not yell at each other or anyone else but we do sometimes differ in opinions as individuals, as is normal,” they wrote. “Characterizing someone with a strong accent as speaking too loudly or as unintelligent is a familiar racist trope.”
Pulice and one other staff member described feeling uncomfortable during a 2020 tutor social at which Ferreras allegedly questioned attendees about their ethnic backgrounds.
“A mandatory end of semester virtual tutor social started with asking tutors how exactly they’re Jewish, and finished with grilling each person about their ethnic background and 23andMe results,” Pulice wrote in his 2021 report.
In their statement, Ferreras and Farrell dismissed the incident as an “invented story,” pointing to racial and gender-based discrimination Ferreras has experienced.
“For us, it is hard to believe and painful to hear a narrative of this nature,” they wrote. “Irina has suffered racial and gender-based bias since the beginning of our tenure.”
Six current staff members described in interviews positive experiences with Farrell and Ferreras.
Building manager Mohamed Zaker said he has not “had an issue” with the faculty deans, citing strong communication and support from the pair.
Robert Roessler, a resident tutor who started in 2019, said he has been “extremely supported” by the faculty deans, who have gone “above and beyond” to help him create a game room and secure new jerseys for intramurals.
“They treat both students and tutors, if you let them, really like family,” Roessler said.
Margaret C. “Maggie” Nowak, a resident tutor since 2019, wrote she “cultivated a very strong relationship” with the faculty deans but acknowledged “tension does happen” within Leverett’s circles.
Leverett had unusually high staff turnover among top administrative positions under Farrell and Ferreras. The house had three resident deans, two building managers, and two house administrators over Farrell and Ferreras’ four-year tenure.
In 2019, Resident Dean Bilal A. Malik announced his mid-year departure from Leverett, thanking only the Georgis in his farewell message. An interim resident dean served from 2019 to 2020, and the succeeding resident dean, Katie Daily, departed this June after just two years in the role. Both Malik and Daily cited family reasons for their departure in announcements to house affiliates.
Only Cabot House had a similar level of resident dean turnover over the four-year period.
Pulice departed Leverett in summer 2021 but stayed at Harvard as a resident tutor in Adams House.
That same year, both Leverett’s house administrator and longtime building manager also departed. Like Pulice — and unlike most departing staff — they stayed at Harvard through lateral transfers to other houses. According to existing data, aside from Leverett, just three resident tutors and one building manager have transferred laterally since fall 2018.
“We cannot comment on staff transfers and do not know how usual or unusual this is,” the faculty deans wrote in May. “We do not know the particulars of these transfers and understood that at least one was due to another’s House need for experience.”
Hoveland described Leverett’s staff turnover as “the great exodus.”
Five former staff members interviewed by The Crimson said they left the house in part to escape the “toxic” work environment. Two others said they were fired.
One former resident tutor said they left because of the faculty deans, despite enjoying interacting with and advising Leverett residents.
Leverett’s annual resident tutor turnover was lower than that of other houses, aside from its above-average turnover in the couple’s first year.
Early into the faculty deans’ tenure, Leverett saw rapid staff turnover in its Senior Common Room network, which includes both non-resident tutors and staff and alumni affiliated with the house.
John Trumpbour, who serves as a non-resident tutor and has been affiliated with Leverett since the mid-1980s, said many members of the SCR were let go under the current faculty deans’ reign, though he was not.
Eleven of Leverett’s 42 non-resident tutors in the 2018-2019 school year were still Leverett affiliates during 2021-2022, per data from the house’s website. The network shrunk to 31 members over this period.
In their statement to The Crimson, Farrell and Ferreras claimed they wrote to all existing affiliates to confirm their desire to continue.
But Joshua A. Reyes ’05-’06, a former non-resident tutor in Leverett, said he and others were unexpectedly fired by the faculty deans in January 2019 in what he deemed the “great SCR purge.”
“We are writing to confirm our decision to terminate your status as a Non-Resident Tutor at Leverett House, effective immediately. We know this comes as a disappointment,” the email from Farrell and Ferreras read, according to a copy provided to The Crimson. “After an analysis of the roles that NRTs are needed to fill at this time, we have reviewed all NRTs and have had to let many go.”
Farrell and Ferreras wrote in a follow-up statement to The Crimson that they convey hiring decisions based on the guidance of tutor committees.
“These tutor recommendation-based decisions can also include nonrenewal of non-resident tutors,” they wrote. “This is not out of the ordinary. Turnover is in the nature of these roles.”
Though some former faculty deans remain house affiliates, the Georgis belong to Lowell House’s SCR rather than Leverett’s. Farrell and Ferreras said they invited the Georgis to the SCR in October 2018, but Howard Georgi “actively undermined [them] with a group of students and staff.”
The Georgis wrote in a statement that they tried to assist Farrell and Ferreras during the transition and had “hoped and assumed that they would work hard to make Leverett a home for all Leverett students.”
“Alas, subsequent events have shown this not to be the case,” the Georgis wrote. “While we were anguished for our many friends in the Leverett student body, SCR and staff, we did not make our concerns public out of respect for Harvard’s wonderful House system.”
“We hope that the system will emerge stronger from this experience,” they added.
Despite mounting tension in the house, few staff and students raised their concerns directly to the faculty deans.
Three current and former staff members said Ferreras and Farrell did not take kindly to feedback, and eight current and former affiliates said they feared retaliation from the pair.
Kandaswamy said she believes she faced retaliation when she condemned an email from the faculty deans regarding the George Floyd protests in summer 2020. The faculty deans’ email, sent on a housewide email list, called riots “socially destructive and self-defeating.”
Kandaswamy replied all to the email — a privilege she had due to her former position as House Committee intramurals representative — to criticize their statement.
“Perhaps riots are a big issue, but your job as faculty deans is first and foremost to stand by your students and ensure that not a single one feels marginalized, and that they can all trust in Leverett House as a place to speak and be heard,” Kandaswamy wrote in the email.
Following Kandaswamy’s email, the faculty deans told Pulice to remove her mailing privileges, which he had already done in anticipation of their request. Kandaswamy’s removal nearly prevented her from recruiting a new intramurals representative via email — a move she called “petty” and “ridiculous.”
Pulice, who oversaw the mailing list, documented the incident in an email to Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01, writing that he was concerned about “a personal vendetta” that the faculty deans held “against a student who dared disagree with them.” He worried that her removal would result in a loss of “institutional memory” for the intramurals program. Kandaswamy was able to find a new representative after Pulice ultimately approved her email, which the faculty deans reprimanded him for.
In their statement, the faculty deans wrote that it was an “administrative oversight” that alums had not yet been taken off the email list post-graduation and denied foul play.
“Anyone who could possibly think we are capable of retaliation does not know us,” the faculty deans wrote in their May statement. “We are sorry the alum perceived this as retaliation, but that is not factual.”
Reyes, the terminated non-resident tutor, had previously emailed the faculty deans asking them to denounce hateful drawings found in Leverett. Reyes said he was later removed from the email list and switched from the pre-business advising committee to the pre-medical committee.
“They told me that I had not advised enough pre-med students,” said Reyes, who has no medical background. “I said, ‘I don’t understand why I would be doing that. I’m not a medical doctor and have never been on the pre-med committee.’”
Reyes said he believes the faculty deans acted out of retaliation due to his earlier emails.
The faculty deans wrote that there is “zero tolerance” for offensive graffiti in the house and emphasized that NRT hiring is handled by resident tutor committees.
“We would be surprised if a non-resident tutor had been moved between pre-career and pre-med, as they don’t tend to have overlap,” they wrote in a follow-up statement.
Pulice said he met with College administrators nine times to discuss the Leverett faculty deans between August 2020 and September 2021.
Both Hoveland, who served as House Committee chair in 2020, and Sorkin, who was chair in 2018, said they raised concerns about the faculty deans to Brandt and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
Sorkin said while administrators “lent a sympathetic ear” and were “on the side of students,” they were ultimately unable to effect actual change.
“Folks are supportive but have a really kind of ‘throw their hands up’ attitude about it because other than when their five-year review hits, no one is kicking out faculty deans, unless it was really, really crazy egregious,” Sorkin said.
Eight students and staff members who brought complaints to administrators said they found the response largely inadequate.
Following the inquiry catalyzed by Pulice, Thimba told Pulice that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana had read the report and administrators had provided the faculty deans with “clear and specific feedback.”
But months later, Pulice emailed Thimba that “the results of any intervention lasted less than four weeks” and the house environment had only worsened.
“The Harvard administration’s actions have made clear that the situation will not change,” Pulice wrote. “I am working to explore other options since I simply cannot continue to be in this abusive and hostile environment.”
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo declined to comment on criticisms of the administration’s response, explaining that the College is unable to comment on personnel matters.
In addition to at least two inquiries prompted by individual complaints, formal reviews of the Leverett faculty deans began late last fall, including a “Faculty Dean Leadership Assessment” survey led by Rachael L. Ellison, a consultant from Harvard’s Center for Workplace Development.
The survey asked respondents to rank the overall effectiveness of the faculty deans on “focusing on the right priorities” and “resolving conflict and complex situations.” It also asked whether the deans furthered belonging and traditions and fostered a “supportive community.”
At the same time, Leverett’s official review committee — chaired by former Adams Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 and consisting of seven other administrators — began soliciting information about the faculty deans and house environment.
Ellison and Palfrey declined to comment on the findings of their assessments of Leverett.
In a March 29 email to house tutors that was obtained by The Crimson, Farrell and Ferreras speculated that the newspaper was investigating them in anticipation of their five-year tenure review. The pair urged tutors to respond to Crimson inquiries and communicate an “accurate” depiction of the house, thanking staff for their “time and support.”
Two months later, Farrell and Ferreras’ sudden resignation came as a surprise to some. It remains unclear why the faculty deans left prematurely. In their announcement to Leverett affiliates, the pair wrote that it was “with deepest sadness” that they were departing.
“We believe this decision is the best for us and our family as we enter a new chapter of our lives,” Farrell and Ferreras wrote.
Both Palumbo and the former faculty deans declined to comment further on the reasons behind the early departure.
Still, some continue to call for greater accountability for one of Harvard’s least understood positions. Decisions on faculty deans are the responsibility of Khurana, the dean of the College.
Britton lamented the lack of “direct oversight” in Harvard’s house system and said it creates “room for abuse.”
“There should be a way to hold people in high positions of power accountable,” Hoveland said. “Other than just reporting it and the ‘wait and see’ method.”
Around 80 percent of the Leverett Class of 2022 reported some level of satisfaction with their living conditions, the second lowest satisfaction rate of all houses. In 2021, just 66 percent of Leverett’s seniors were satisfied, the lowest of any house.
But even before the arrival of Farrell and Ferreras, Leverett consistently received low scores in house satisfaction surveys. Some attribute this to its size and layout: disjointed buildings comprising among the largest undergraduate population of Harvard’s houses.
In their statement to The Crimson, Farrell and Ferreras noted that their position came with the “stress of optimizing limited resources.”
Reyes said he has been in conversation with the current House Committee chairs on expanding house life with Leverett traditions he experienced as an undergraduate and as a former House Committee chair.
“Leverett culture has really withered under the [former faculty deans],” he said. “It is important to restore the institutional memory.”
With the turnover of all of Leverett’s deans this year, some are hopeful that a blank slate can lead Leverett in a new direction.
Harvard Medical School professors Eileen E. Reynolds ’86 ​​and Daniel G. Deschler currently serve as Leverett’s interim faculty deans, while former resident tutor John F. Nowak has taken over as interim resident dean.
Sorkin, who served on Leverett’s previous faculty dean selection committee, said he hopes student input is more strongly considered in the search for the house’s next leaders.
“I really just hope that this time around, people will listen to student voice and bring on people who understand that Leverett is not in a good place — or is in a place where there’s a lot of room for growth and improvement,” he said.
For others, Ferreras and Farrell’s departure is “long overdue.”
“I left my position in Leverett House for one reason and one reason only—the unrelentingly toxic work environment created by Brian Farrell and Irina Ferreras,” Pulice wrote in a June email. “My thoughts are with all the students and staff for whom this decision came far too late.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This season is going to be about us really just continuing to hit our highest possible standards, because I think when we do that, we’re going to be a difficult team to defend and play against,” said Harvard women’s soccer head coach Chris Hamblin, reflecting after the team’s season-opener win over Central Connecticut.
Harvard is back in action and there was no shortage of excitement in a successful week. It outshot Central Connecticut 18-2 en route to a dominant 3-0 victory on Friday, Aug. 26, in New Britain, Conn. and followed it up with a thrilling 3-2 comeback win over Northeastern in the home opener at Jordan Field three days later.
The Crimson (2-0-0, 0-0) entered the season ranked No. 2 in the Ivy League preseason media poll, trailing only the Brown Bears. Harvard starts this season with outstanding returning talent and incoming first-year players, who are poised to compete for a title following last season’s success – which saw it go 12-3-1 overall and 5-2 in conference play, earning an at-large bid to the NCAA Division I Tournament for the first time since 2004 in the process.
“The level of practice has been outstanding, the level of commitment to every activity, every video session,” said Hamblin, who later added that as sharp as his players have been, the team still has a long way to go. ”Every weight room session has been at a really, really high standard.” He also praised the team’s success in supporting and integrating the class of five first-years as they begin their time at Harvard.
This season, the Crimson will play an even more challenging non-conference schedule, with opportunities to compete at North Carolina State and Texas Christian University, both top-25 teams last year. NC State advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament, while TCU made it all the way to the third round, where the Horned Frogs fell to Rutgers in penalty kicks.
The Crimson went down early to the Huskies (1-2-1, 0-0) as Northeastern found the net in the seventh minute, but Harvard struck back in the 16th minute after senior midfielder Hannah Griffin fired a pass to sophomore midfielder Hannah Bebar, who then found senior forward Angela Caloia for the goal. The Crimson went up 2-1 after roles were reversed and Bebar scored off the assist from Caloia.
The Huskies scored the equalizer just before the first half ended, netting a tough shot that sailed above junior goalkeeper Anna Karpenko, despite the full-extension save attempt. Harvard replied with the eventual game-winner in the second half, as sophomore forward Ainsley Ahmadian headed in sophomore midfielder Áslaug Gunnlaugsdóttir’s corner kick to secure a thrilling victory. The game proved to be the first test of the season.
“I think there’s a lot of areas where we need to do better…and I think shining the light on those areas is going to help us now,” Hamblin said. “I think when you don’t play great, but you still find a way to win, that’s a really good sign of the resilience of the group. I don’t think anyone’s walking away from here thinking that we played really well.”
While the team shone as a collective unit against the Blue Devils (1-2-0, 0-0), the spotlight was on sophomore center midfielder Josefine Hasbo, as she scored all three Crimson goals of the night—the first program hat-trick since Midge Purce ‘17 in 2015. The first came on a loose ball, while the second and third were assisted by first-year forward Audrey Francois and Bebar, respectively.
“She covers a ton of ground, and we’ve been working with her to try and get into the box more,” Hamblin said.“She showed up in the right spaces.”
“I think the key is our ability to work together and manage our energy…on and off the field,” said Hasbo, reflecting on the team’s preparation and drive, which has been key to its success so far.
Harvard’s success has not gone unnoticed away from Cambridge, either; three Crimson players have been called up to compete with their respective national teams during qualifiers for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, which will take place in Australia and New Zealand. Hasbo, Gunnlaugsdóttir, and sophomore defender Jade Rose will be competing for Denmark, Iceland, and Canada, respectively.
“[It’s] really an incredible, incredible opportunity [and] achievement for all of them,” Hamblin said. “That’s going to now give other people the chance to step up, which we’ve really excited about as well.”
“Overall, I think it’s just kind of this huge opportunity that I’m so happy the team has supported me in,” added Hasbo, who flew out the day after the Central Connecticut game, but will only miss two games.
Harvard hits the pitch again this Friday on the first part of its trip to North Carolina, squaring off against UNC Greensboro for its third game of the year. Two days later, on Sunday, it plays highly-anticipated opponent NC State. Against the Wolfpack, Harvard will surely earn a boost from the return of Hasbo, who will be back from Denmark after scoring in the Danish national team’s 5-1 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers win over Montenegro on Thursday.

Classes? Who is she. We’re still reminiscing about summer — whether we were in South America, the Bay Area, or hanging around Cambridge, those sweaty sweaty days are still on the brain (instead of our p-set 0). Read on to see a snapshot of what Flyby writers were up to this summer!
Flyby Abroad:
Matylda A. Urbaniak: After deciding that I couldn't possibly roast in the furnace that the Northeastern United States over the summer, I did a lil 180 — I traveled to the winter of Santiago, Chile, to work for an environmental conservation organization. Here, my main hobby was complaining about the cold and wearing five layers to work because unlike in Boston, there is no indoor heating. Thankfully, it made me feel grateful enough about returning to the summer that I didn’t complain about the heat for a whole few hours!!
Tina Chen: All the manifesting finally came true — because this summer, I lived that hot girl European life (on sweet Harvard dime). With absolutely zero German knowledge, I lived in Germany for two months, drinking sparkling water, eating brötchen to my heart’s content, and just not knowing what was happening around me most of the time. Although I was part of a fellowship program working a full-time internship, it ended up being mostly remote with some loose tasks here and there. So instead, I packed my bags and spent most of my time on speedy European trains and traveling to different cities (if my supervisor somehow finds this, I’m kidding <3). I made it to Amsterdam, Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Brussels, and Paris. It was a great international experience, but alas, I will now be spending the next three weeks adjusting to HUDS food and being under the drinking age again </3.
Ellen S. Deng: Like every other Harvard student, I spent my summer across the pond in Europe, interning in Geneva, Switzerland, and raving about the food and public transportation. While I wasn’t pushing my lactose intolerance to the limit with French and Swiss cheeses or discovering the beauty of desktop monitors, I solo-traveled across Western Europe, meeting the coolest people while sleeping staying in hostels (or falling down a mountain). Dean Khurana would be proud of just how much I was transformed by my experience <3
Corinne E. Furey:
This summer, one of Flyby Blog’s newest members, Corinne E. Furey, partook in all of the traditional “everyone look I’m abroad” activities: hopping between various countries, taking as many photos as her no-storage camera roll allowed, and stealing borrowing the local pets (see picture below). After “gracefully” exiting a week in Greece, Corinne ventured to London to take a course where knowledge was learned and adventures were had. Upon returning home to the lovely state of Delaware, Corinne attempted to reconcile her absurd sleep debt before training for the upcoming Volleyball preseason (#RollCrim).
Flyby At Home:
Raymond Wu: This past summer I went back home to New York City and interned for JamRock Productions, a new theater production company. I was tasked with making the website for the company and taking meeting minutes and a bunch of other typical intern duties, but the fun part was that I could go to a bunch of theatrical performances (for FREE!!!!). We went to Broadway shows, Off-Broadway shows, and presentations and workshops for shows still under development. I also went to Times Square more times this summer than I have ever been in my life previously and got lost every single time, but at least now I can kind of read street signs.
Get You a Writer Who Can Do Both:
Janani Sekar: I spent most of the summer suffering in the gross, sticky, Cambridge humidity while working on cool research. But the month of August was a little spicier. I went back home to the Bay Area and drank lots of good coffee in the best city in the world (San Francisco). And then I yeeted across the planet to India and then to Thailand, where I suffered in more humidity, saw the Taj Mahal, ate really good mangoes, and shopped at outdoor markets for a lot of things I wanted but did not need. Now, I’m dealing with the consequences (limited closet space and horrible jetlag).
Anjali Z. Mehta: Staying true to Harvard stereotypes, I worked at a consulting firm for the majority of the summer. I racked up airline points traveling during the week and mastered the art of making aesthetically pleasing decks. I’m even currently having Powerpoint withdrawal. Afterward, I and my (literal) mother joined everyone and their (figurative) mother in Europe, as we traveled around Spain for a week. I then returned to campus to lead a FOP trip. I loved getting to know my FOPpers, and, as a directionally challenged individual, am pretty proud that we only went two miles off route. I’m so excited to return to campus, experience house life, and attend parties that aren’t in Tasty Basty!
Alexandra A. Kassinis: ​​I spent this summer interning remotely at Save the Children US, working and conducting research as part of their Climate Change team! I lived in Boston for part of the summer and was able to explore new parts of the city, visit Cape Cod and take a quick trip to Washington D.C. I spent the second half of the summer at home, in Cyprus, soaking up the beautiful Mediterranean sun and spending a lot of time at the beach!
