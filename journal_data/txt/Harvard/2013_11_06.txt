After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marshall Mathers is now 41 years old, and on his new album, he sounds every single one of them. The Detroit artist has been rapping about the end of his career for so long that it’s easy to forget that his erratic discography spans almost two decades. But on his most recent album, “The Marshall Mathers LP 2,” Eminem sounds burdened rather than empowered by his verteran status.
Nobody knows this better than Eminem himself—on “The Marshall Mathers LP 2,” he seems even more obsessed with his own career’s demise than ever before, even going as far as to name the album after his critically acclaimed “The Marshall Mathers LP” of 13 years ago in a bid to recapture his more potent years. But like many rappers before him (most famously Nas, who titled one of his many mediocre albums “Stillmatic”), Eminem comes off as desperate rather than experienced. The album opens with “Bad Guy,” a song that immediately pays tribute to his achingly tragic “Stan.” But instead of pulling at the heartstrings, Eminem fuses the storyline of “Stan” with his characteristic proclivity for shock humor, shouting, “Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, I hope you can swim good, now say you hate homos again!” to the sound of a car driving off of a bridge.
As always, Eminem is furious and unforgiving, taking pride in his willingness to spit lines that other rappers wouldn’t dare say. But on “The Marshall Mathers LP 2,” he begins to move away from lyricism in exchange for wordy tripe and shock value. Eminem can still rap, as he proves on “Rap God,” on which he shifts into hyperdrive, at one point spitting lines at a mind-numbing 6.5 words per second. But tracks such as these, which are supposed to be the coronation tracks of “The Marshall Mathers LP 2,” are cheapened with empty lines like “You like normal? / Fuck being normal.” “So Much Better” comes to a juvenile climax when Eminem confides, “A woman broke my ha-art, I say ha-art cause she ripped it into pa-arts and threw it in the garbage.” He then insists that he will not say the “L-word” anymore, following up with a primitive scream, “I lo-lo-lo-lo-lesbian!”
This lyrical deficiency is most bothersome on deeply personal tracks like “Headlights,” on which Eminem forgives his mother for his neglected childhood. Eminem’s delivery is powerful, his voice growing into a passionate scream as he offers lines such as “Ma! I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo! / All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both!” Unfortunately, his clumsy lyricism once again comes in between Eminem and his intent, turning “Headlights” into a flimsy and comical testimonial reminiscent of the Backstreet Boys’ “The Perfect Fan.”
“The Marshall Mathers LP 2” almost redeems itself, however, on “Love Game,” which inventively samples the surf rock-influenced “Game of Love” by Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders. An adroit and bipolar Kendrick Lamar sounds like he actually belongs on the track, something that a featured artist hasn’t been able to do throughout Eminem’s discography (Lil Wayne’s cringe-worthy feature on 2010’s “No Love” included). Eminem responds positively to this injection of Lamar, sounding younger and lighter on his feet as he follows the young rapper with his most impressive verse on the album. Eminem grows more and more psychotic until he suddenly drops a casual delivery of the line, “Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screaming / I body slam her on the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole.” He goes on to turn his own shock value on its head and address some of the most honest topics on the entire album.
However, the few bright spots on “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” don’t buoy the entire album. Ultimately, what the album lacks most is believability—it falls too short in too many ways to live up to its hype. Unlike other rappers, Eminem does not shy away from addressing his dying career, but his obsession with the topic turns an interesting merit into a point of criticism. With Eminem not growing any younger, “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” unfortunately proves more about his chops than it does about his art.

"Hold Tight"
Justin Bieber, album not yet titled
The third in Justin Bieber’s single series Music Mondays, “Hold Tight” takes the teen pop sensation one step further in his evolution to adult R&B artist. Minimalist and sparse with whispers of synth, the track allows Bieber to showcase his vocal ability without risk of being overpowered by heavy backing instrumentation. The song is the sexiest yet in the Music Monday series, as Bieber delivers variations on “Hold on tight / Your lips won’t let me go” in a surprisingly husky croon, signaling his growing appeal to a more adult audience.
"It's About Time"
Young the Giant, Mind Over Matter
Three years have elapsed since the release of Young the Giant’s eponymous debut album, and it truly is about time that the band turned out new material. Now signed to Fueled by Ramen, the masterminds behind pop-punk phenomena Panic! at the Disco and Fall Out Boy, the Irvine-based band have released a single that seems only to homogenize them with the rest of the bands on their new label. Lead singer Sameer Gadhia’s scratchy half-yelling sounds far more like Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump than it does his typical smooth, soothing style. “It’s About Time” marks the disappearance of the optimistic Young the Giant, with their characteristic beachy California sound, leaving instead a much darker group devoid of the cheerful naïveté of its younger years.
"How I Feel"
Flo Rida, The Perfect 10
In paying tribute to “Feeling Good,” Flo Rida’s new single does an injustice to Nina Simone. The song is a carbon copy of his 2009 club anthem “Right Round,” with a near-identical pounding beat and monotonous vocal delivery. While “Right Round” was far from a work of musical genius, “How I Feel” seems even less inspired. Even the sampling of Simone’s classic hit falls short: it seems the rapper has merely cut and spliced “Feeling Good” and clumsily inserted his own vocals in between the fragments with little to no transition, resulting in a poorly constructed, overdone track that makes no musical innovations and promises to soon fade into obscurity.

Two weeks ago, a 12-year-old student roamed the halls of Sparks Middle School, located just beyond Reno, Nevada, wielding his parent’s handgun with intent to kill. In an effort to contain the violence, teacher Mike Landsbury paid the ultimate sacrifice. Sadly, stories like this have broken again and again in recent memory, temporarily paralyzing the nation each time. From the Pontiac Rebellion Massacre in 1764 to the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year, school shootings have always had a place in American history.
As with all stories of this nature, the media swooped in like vultures, hoping to provide details to the country immediately. Although a journalist’s main function is to uncover these particulars, in instances like these, the rapid availability of information is not necessarily beneficial. Contemporary media coverage of such delicate events is not only tasteless, but harmful as well.
The media began exploiting students’ horror stories just three days after the incident. These students, especially the one shot by the culprit, undoubtedly just lived through one of the most traumatic experiences of their lives and require time to reflect and seek help. Forced remembrance at the hands of reporters seeking quotes for a story can induce severe trauma. Some may argue that retelling the story could prove therapeutic for the victims, but even the most resilient student would have difficulty processing such a tragic event that quickly.
Furthermore, in most instances the information we as bystanders receive is minimal compared to the aforementioned costs of said material. Time and time again relatively uninformed students are recorded rambling on about how they didn’t really know the shooter, “but he seemed innocent enough.” This “insight” sheds no light on the matter, but it does subject students to unnecessary and harmful media scrutiny. No one benefits from this system except media corporations’ bank accounts. Stories are written brimming with irrelevant and speculative quotes from students that fixate on the killer rather than the overarching problem.
Not only does this system harm students at almost every turn, it can also induce more violence. The media’s repeated "monsterization" of the culprits behind these mass murders can provide potential shooters motivation to commit future atrocities. Oftentimes, a yearning for recognition is responsible for a gunman’s actions. Although this publicity is overwhelmingly negative, in the eyes of a potential shooter any legacy may be preferable to being forgotten.
These catastrophes tend to crop up in bursts, and this is not a coincidence. For example, between January 10 and January 31 of this year, eight school shootings occurred. Following this strand of violence, a school shooting did not surface again until three months later, and even then only in limited capacity. Violence breeds violence. More recently, Philip Chism slaughtered his teacher a mere 48 hours after the massacre in Reno.
To combat the number of deaths at the hands of armed students, the media should stop focusing their efforts on picking apart the suspects and begin concentrating instead on what led to their actions. What the country needs at a time like this, even more than dozens of op-eds promoting stronger gun control laws, is a reform in how we deal with mental illness. Although a shooter's motives for such terrible crimes will rarely be known, as 75 percent of shooters kill themselves following an attack, poor mental health is a leading cause for such rash and impulsive decision-making.
Over time, mental illnesses—obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, depression—have developed an alienating and inescapable stigma. In addition to subjecting those diagnosed with mental illness to shame and humiliation, this stigma prevents potentially ailing patients from reaching out for help in the first place.
Because a handful of media conglomerates supply a majority of the information presented to the public, their ability to convey stories in an accurate and strategic manner is of the utmost importance. Cliché though it is, with great power comes great responsibility. Rather than devoting precious airtime to a biographical depiction of the shooter and calling into question an ethnicity or religion, media moguls should work toward breaking the stigma of mental illness. In a de-stigmatized world, students who feel depressed or excluded would be willing to seek out the help they need, reducing the frequency of these terrible events.
In moments of tragedy, what matters most is not whether CNN is in the black, but the prevention of further human loss. Understanding the circumstances that played into a shooter’s fatal decision is beneficial not only for the immediate community affected, but people everywhere who hope to prevent added bloodshed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid has announced a new social media outreach program to help low-income applicants navigate the complex college application process. While this program, the Harvard College Connection, will not by itself take the place of connected academic advisors and alumni networks, it will help bridge the gap by offering necessary support online. While we should not incorrectly take social media as a panacea, as part of a broader approach to diversify the student application pool this initiative is certainly a step in the right direction.
Several days after the program was officially announced, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 admitted to The Crimson that there was substantial socioeconomic disparity in the early applicant pool, a situation he expects will "continue to be the case for the foreseeable future." And now that it looks increasingly likely that race-based affirmative action programs could be ruled unconstitutional, it could become even more difficult to attract students of underrepresented races.
Despite reinstating early action, which, there is substantial evidence to believe, tends to favor higher income students, Harvard has done a good job increasing applicant diversity through its generous financial aid packages and its holistic admissions process. Now, by increasing its presence on social media platforms, the Harvard College Connection will present yet another way to attract a more diverse group of candidates. But the College can go even farther by reaching out directly and more proactively to qualified students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
Students from wealthier backgrounds on average attend better schools, have superior college counselors, can afford expensive tutors, and have family connections to elite colleges. Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, on the other hand, often have little knowledge about the college application process, get lost in the complex labyrinth of interconnected websites, and struggle to pay the $89 fee for AP tests, a crucial component of the application.
These are some of the obstacles that the new initiative can begin to remove. Making Harvard more accessible through social media is not remedy enough for the deep-rooted social inequalities faced by America’s underprivileged students. But the Harvard College Connection is a worthwhile resource with the potential to target a great deal of talented students. We look forward to seeing its results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, as I was sitting in the lobby of Emerson Hall, a youngish man came up and asked where he could find the psychology department. I pointed him across campus to William James Hall, rolling my eyes just a little bit—after all, Emerson does have “PHILOSOPHY” engraved in stone above its front entrance.
Perhaps this man was a very confused prospective graduate student. Perhaps, though, he was simply reading a map from the first half of the 20th century: From its construction in 1905 until the opening of William James Hall in 1946, Emerson Hall housed most of Harvard’s psychology library and laboratories. In fact, for many decades, philosophy, natural science, and experimental psychology were incontrovertibly disciplinarily connected.
Some historical legacies linger long past their due dates. Harvard was founded by and large to serve the white male ruling elite of New England. Today, despite the best efforts of the Admissions Office and student organizing, our university’s centuries of exclusivity remain patently obvious. They are visible everywhere from the portraits on the walls of Annenberg to the valorization of the “Western canon” in our social science classes to the persistent lack of diversity among University faculty.
On the other hand, some histories are quickly forgotten. If I had not enrolled in the history of psychology class I’m taking right now, I would never have known that Emerson Hall used to house Harvard’s psychologists as well as its philosophers. (The third and fourth floors once boasted everything from experimental studies on rats to B. F. Skinner’s teaching machines!) I would also never have known that the famous psychologist William James also believed strongly in the power of psychics and mediums to access important parts of human perception, or that in order to test this belief, famed Boston medium Margery Crandon was tested by none other than Harry Houdini in a series of séances, many of which took place in Emerson Hall itself.
Why are some histories remembered but others forgotten? For one, it’s often easier to write a now-embarrassing historical moment out of institutional histories (whether deliberately or not) than deal with it. As 20th-century psychologists worked to form their field into a quantitative and scientific discipline, James’s fascination with séances became an embarrassing historical glitch that did not conform well with contemporary academic practice. As Laurel Thatcher Ulrich notes, “what the University chooses to celebrate about its past is highly selective.”
Perhaps this is why no student today knows that when now-venerated biology professor E. O. Wilson used to give lectures on his theory of sociobiology, they were sometimes picketed by angry students. Perhaps this is why no one remembers that the “positive economics” narrative of capitalism taught by N. Gregory Mankiw used to be disputed in radical sections of Economics 10, where students studied Marxist theory. And perhaps this is why the existence of Radcliffe College as a women’s institution separate from Harvard is simply recalled as an embarrassing relic of a sexist past, meant to be erased as quickly as possible instead of celebrated.
Treating history simply as a tool to valorize the present does injustice to the past lives of those who are now unable to defend the fact of their own existences. More significantly, though, it obscures the ways in which the past has created the present. Whether visible (as in the white men of Harvard’s past) or invisible (as in the Marxists of Harvard’s economics department), historical actors have contributed to the structures and ideologies now in the spaces they used to occupy. (By the way, this is one of the reasons why it’s so poignant and powerful when institutions keep their own archives: It’s one thing for scholars to access searchable databases online, but it’s quite another when papers can be curated by librarians who can read them in context. An optimal digitization strategy would not neglect one of these for the other.)
Simply recounting history is not a sufficient response. Harvard has commemorated its charter to educate Indian students with a website hosted by the Peabody Museum and regular archeological digs at the site of the 1655 Indian College, yet it ignores the requests of present-day Native American students to rename the fall University holiday from “Columbus Day” to “Indigenous People’s Day.” Truly remembering history requires engagement and learning, not just bland narration of facts.
I don’t believe that ghosts linger in space to haunt future memory. But the people, institutions, and events of the past have certainly shaped the structures, both physical and social, of today. Perhaps that confused man asking for directions was actually just lost. But perhaps, in search of psychology, he was drawn to Emerson Hall by some remembered tug from the past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Expert political pundit Lewis Black loved to hate on the Bush administration. Still does, as far as I can tell. He was particularly concerned about the lack of weapons of mass destruction, or more specifically the lack of falsified documentation regarding such weapons. “If they couldn’t find the weapons, which was the reason we went to war, then why didn’t they make something up? Why did they stop lying? My government has always lied to me. I’m comfortable with that. Son of a…”
The Obama administration got its knickers in quite a twist with the recent revelation that, despite assurances from the president himself, some individuals who already have insurance will be kicked off their plans. “If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” Meanwhile, upwards of 50 percent of the 14 million Americans who buy health insurance individually will lose coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, according to an NBC News investigation. So was Obama lying?
Of course he was. “Obama’s quote is being taken out of context,” some of my friends protest half-heartedly. I might be inclined to agree, at least for the first dozen or two times Obama trotted out his now infamous line, but after a certain point the context stopped mattering so much. “Mr. President, what can you tell us about the IRS scandal?” a reporter might ask. His answer would likely include, “Well, uh, it’s important to remember, uh, if you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep it.”
Some unnamed sources close to the matter have acknowledged the mistake and point to a number of “technical glitches” plaguing Obama’s speeches and interviews for the past several years. “There were a series of typos on the teleprompter,” I was told by a news anchorman who wishes to remain anonymous but has a name that rhymes with Bon Rurgundy.
Others maintain that Obama’s lie was, in fact, not a lie. Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Shultz was interviewed by Bill Maher and maintained that Obama’s assertion was not a lie. “It was not a lie, let’s just be very clear. So let me knock that down right away.… That was referring to the overwhelming majority of Americans who have health care.” I tried using a similar line on my parole officer, but he politely informed me that abstaining from theft an “overwhelming majority” of the time is not sufficient to keep me out of jail.
In an interview with Piers Morgan, Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone explained: “People can keep their plans. Plans are grandfathered.” Unsurprisingly, those two sentences are filled with more asterisks than Barry Bonds’ home run record. The Department of Health and Human Services wrote regulations restricting the qualifications of grandfathered insurance plans, including a gem specifying that if a plan increased copayments by more than $5 plus inflation, it would not be eligible to be grandfathered. As far back as 2010, the administration predicted that “40 to 67 percent” of Americans who purchased their own insurance would lose coverage.
Many must have been wondering why on Earth the government would let us know that it was lying. Of course, people are bound to find out at some point that their health care got yanked. Ideally, they will realize it prior to actually needing their insurance and have a chance to test out the new website HealthCare.gov before it spontaneously combusts and needs to be rushed to the emergency room. This means, naturally, that Obama’s lie was not going to stay any more secret than Angela Merkel’s private telephone calls.
Which brings me to what, best as I can tell, is my point. How could the president tell us such a lousy lie? He couldn’t find anything better to lie about? Like Lewis Black, you see, I am completely comfortable with my president lying to me. I would just prefer he lie to me about something less easily exposed, or at least remotely more interesting. (The whole debate is “arguing over minutiae,” Wasserman-Shultz assures us, which is, in classic fashion, a lie, and not a particularly interesting one at that.) Obama’s fib is not even remotely close to good enough to make the pantheon of best presidential lies.
“I am not a crook.”
“Read my lips, no new taxes.”
“I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”
“Happy birthday, Mr. President.”
I expect better lies from my commander-in-chief.

A month after the Obama administration launched a fault-ridden website for healthcare services, technology and politics expert Clay Shirky spoke at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics about the internet’s capacity for “civic value.” Shirky pointed out errors in the planning and implementation of HealthCare.gov that show how the government could better manage its online services.
At the event, moderated by current IOP Fellow Ginny Hunt on Tuesday night, Shirky said that the site, like any major technological project, should have been launched slowly and in iterations. Obama’s team released the entire site on Oct. 1 to limit the political opposition that would have accompanied each release. By launching the site all at once despite multiple glitches, however, the team actually provided more fodder for criticism.
Shirky said that when problems arose, the team should have amended its original plan to launch the entire site on the set date.
“The question that anyone who launches a large tech product faces, is ‘When is reality allowed to trump planning?’” Shirky said. “In Washington, the answer is usually, ‘Never.’”
Rather than adopting the attitude “Failure is not an option,” website developers must consider potential failures periodically. Shirky, an adjunct professor at New York University, said that he often tells his students to stop in the middle of a project and anticipate potential failures in a “pre-mortem” evaluation.
“It’s astonishing what they already know,” said Shirky. “Technological disasters don’t surprise anyone on the inside—people knew what was going to go wrong with HealthCare.gov.”
Shirky, who described himself as “perversely optimistic” about the future of technology, also pointed out some positive implications of the website’s launch.
“In an environment of hyper-partisanship, no one said that using the web was a bad idea in the first place,” Shirky pointed out. “The marker we have just passed is that now [the Internet] is not just a normal, but a good and stable way to deliver complicated services to the American people. “
At the forum, Shirky predicted that federal and state governments will continue to use the internet and new media to implement policy and communicate with the public.
“Interactions with the passport agency, the DMV, etc., are all heading in that direction, and we’re now starting to see real service delivery, entitlements and so forth, heading in that direction as well,” said Shirky in an interview with The Crimson after the event.
Tuesday’s forum was the first in a two-part series on social innovation which will conclude with a Nov. 21 panel discussion on the “Social Impact Economy.”

Two deans from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences laid out priorities and concerns on behalf of colleagues involved in the planning process for the school’s eventual move to Allston at the monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday afternoon.
 The deans, Steven C. Wofsy and Robert D. Howe, called on University and FAS administration to ensure that Allston will become a thriving neighborhood where SEAS faculty and students can still collaborate productively with the University’s liberal arts core.
Their comments reiterated a number of sentiments that have been expressed by SEAS faculty in recent months. The deans also proposed new ideas such as reimagining the use of classroom space in Allston to optimize digital learning.
“Allston must be part of the overall Harvard campus and Allston must be as central as the Cambridge campus is,” Howe said.
He added that the University must be careful to keep the new SEAS campus connected with other key departments and disciplines.
“At present we distinguish our  program...in that our students are embedded in the liberal arts,” Howe said. “If we create an engineering ghetto over in Allston, our students won't have an opportunity for that interaction, and it will be very detrimental for them and our overall engineering program.”
Howe also said that members of the SEAS faculty have participated in two retreats to discuss the move to Allston since it was first announced by administrators in February.
“Originally people thought that the idea of moving across the river was going to represent a threat to that way of thinking,” Wofsy said. “I believe that now we are coming around to the view that it can actually be an incredible opportunity.”
After the presentation by Wofsy and Howe, various professors rose to share their thoughts on the plans for relocation. Diana Sorensen, divisional dean of the arts and humanities, said that she hopes her department will be consulted as the University refines its plan for Allston.
“We believe that the vision that has just been outlined for Allston, which we celebrate, will be deeply enlivened with the presence of the arts, all the art forms, our collections, and, in general, humanistic work,” Sorensen said. “So I just want to say, we are ready to join the conversation.”
IN THE KNOW
The rest of the Tuesday’s meeting featured a diverse array of business, in spite of sparse attendance.
In an attempt to pursue greater transparency on behalf of the Faculty Council—which sets the agenda for Faculty Meetings and is FAS’s only elected, representative body—Docket Committee member Timothy J. Colton, chair of the government department, spoke on projects being considered by the Council this year. These include discussions of potential changes to the Q guide, retirement plans for new faculty members, the rising purchase price of scholarly journals for the Harvard University Library, changing federal Title IX regulations, and the future of the Division of Continuing Education.
Faculty also heard a report from biological oceanography professor James J. McCarthy on the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, as well as an update from Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron ’89 on the electronic communications task force he leads. Barron’s commentary garnered some feedback from faculty members, who proposed looking at existing privacy standards for other modes of communication as a model for an electronic policy.
More substantive discussion was given to a report by a working group within the Committee on the Study of Religion at Harvard. Chinese history professor Michael J. Puett explained that the report calls for the creation of a Council on Religion, which will enable the Committee to develop and evaluate four-year standard curricular plans.
Comparative religion and Indian studies professor Diana L. Eck, a member of the Committee, also pointed out that the new report will allow for the merger of the Divinity School and FAS doctoral programs into a single religion Ph.D. program.
The last Faculty Meeting of the semester is slated for Dec. 3.

Sasha Chanoff, co-founder and executive director of the refugee resettlement organization RefugePoint, received the 2013 Gleitsman International Activist Award, given to an activist who has improved the quality of life for others, at a reception at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday evening.
“Unanimously, what we at Gleitsman heard about Sasha were testaments to his very intentional collaboration style, his passion for partnership…and nurturing the leaders within his organization,” said Casey Otis-Cote, the Associate Director for the Gleitsman Program in Social Change and Special Initiatives at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.
Ralph Nader and Nelson Mandela are among past notables who have received the award, which was created and funded by television executive Alan Gleitsman and is given in alternating years to a domestic or international figure.
The reception, which was open to the public, was attended by a broad spectrum of individuals, many of whom had connections to refugee issues or Chanoff’s work.
Two graduate students at the Kennedy School said they came because of a passion for solving humanitarian problems. One tutored asylum-seekers in Hong Kong. The other, Charles Data, was himself a South Sudanese refugee in Uganda for 17 years. “I lived through my own refugee experience, and to hear the stories of others who had to leave their country under duress is moving,” he said.
Data also acknowledged that his life has developed in far more positive ways than the lives of the vast majority of refugees, in large part because he received resettlement assistance from an organization similar to RefugePoint.
After a cocktail hour, Center of Public Leadership Executive Director Patricia S. Bellinger ’83 introduced a video created by Michael Kleiman, a CPL fellow and long-time collaborator with Chanoff. The video showed the reunion of a Congolese husband and his children with their long-time refugee mother. The mother, who had been kidnapped, was reconnected with her family through the work of RefugePoint.
 
Chanoff then joined RefugePoint Chief Operating Officer Amy Slaughter, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Regional Representative Shelly Pitterman, and Executive Director of the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan Deng Majok Chol in a discussion about the state of refugee assistance. All the speakers said their work benefited from collaboration and the ability to empathize with refugees.
 
Chanoff recalled how a massacre of Congolese nationals in Burundi piqued his interest in activism, while Pitterman discussed his desire to expand a yearly “Refugee Congress” in Washington with representatives from all 50 states.
 
Shortly before accepting his award, specially designed by architect and artist Maya Lin, from CPL Director David R. Gergen, Chanoff again stressed the necessity for cooperation.
 
“The cataclysms that are befalling the world right now and are leading to more and more refugees are mind-boggling and unspeakable,” he said. “It is going to take all of us, and we need leaders who are collaborative.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 12, 2013, at 9:13 a.m.
The Cambridge City Council will see some fresh faces next year, as voters selected four newcomers to the city’s governing body, knocking one-term councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom and 23-year veteran Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 off the Council, according to preliminary election results released Tuesday night.
Current Councillors Leland Cheung, Craig A. Kelley, David P. Maher, E. Denise Simmons, and Timothy J. Toomey Jr. were sent back to the Council, and Dennis Benzan, Dennis Carlone, Nadeem Mazen, and Marc McGovern appeared poised for first-time victories based on an early count.
The preliminary vote total does not include about 700 ballots that will be counted on Wednesday, and due to the close nature of the race, the results could change.
Cambridge employs an electoral system that allows voters to rank their candidates. If a candidate receives more votes than he or she needs to be elected, surplus ballots are passed on to the next candidate still seeking votes. If a candidate is the lowest vote-holder following a given round of counting, he or she is defeated and the ballots in his or her stack are redistributed to the candidate ranked next on those ballots. This process continues until nine councillors are elected.
This complicated system has, in the past, led to invalid ballots—as in when citizens attempt to rank multiple candidates as their first choice—but, according to this year’s preliminary results, no ballots were invalidated.
Cheung, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, for the second straight election had the strongest performance of the night, receiving 2,317 first-place votes—900 more than any other candidate received.
“I am very thankful to all the voters. It’s a strong response that shows that people like the ideas I stand for and what I bring to Council,” Cheung told The Crimson Tuesday night. “I’m going to get as much done as possible for the residents and for the city they work, live, and play in.”
The city saw an 11-percent increase in preliminary turnout over the last municipal election two years ago, which David Anderson, a precinct official at Graham and Parks School, described as “above-average.”
Cambridge’s voters told The Crimson that issues like development, housing, and education brought them to the polls on Tuesday to elect representatives to the City Council and School Committee. Specifically, voters said they were concerned with affordable housing, loss of green space, and construction and infrastructure.
“I live directly across from the Law School, and I’ve been dealing with construction for the last six years,” said Mary Allen Wilkes, a Cambridge voter and 1975 Harvard Law School graduate. “I wish they would coordinate public, private, and university construction. I really don’t think they talk to each other.”
A veteran of the Cambridge School Committee, preliminary 9th place finisher McGovern campaigned on increasing availability of low- and middle-income housing and expanding the availability of quality early childhood education.
“I want to support families in Cambridge who are struggling with poverty and make sure every person has an equal opportunity to take advantage of everything that Cambridge has to offer,” McGovern said.
At Harvard, the election generated interest among students in large part because of the campaign efforts of Logan E. Leslie ’16, who ran for the Council on a platform focused on student voice in the city. His efforts fell short, as his 482 first-place votes and 543 final votes placed him 14th in the election.
“There has been a lot of student interest, which you don’t normally see,” said Daniel R. Ki ’15, who voted in the election. “The fact that a student is running for City Council has generated a lot of sparks and conversations on campus.”
Some citizens like Jeff Spurr, a former member of Harvard Art Museums’ Collections Committee, said he  looked to vote for a candidate who demonstrated responsiveness to citizens and progressive political values.
Others voted to support friends running for the Council.
“Two of my friends are running for City Council. I had to come here, or they would’ve killed me,” said Henry Louis Gates Jr., a university professor.
Cambridge also voted to elect a six-person school committee, selecting Patricia Nolan, Alfred Fantini, Richard Harding, Kathleen Kelly, Fran Cronin, and Mervan Osborne, according to the preliminary results.
“The school system is changing dramatically,” said Irving Allen, a Cambridge resident. “I have kids in Cambridge schools and want to make sure they’re supported…. This election is crucial.”
The final count will be tallied on Nov. 15. The mayor of Cambridge, who serves as the chair of the Council and the School Committee, will be elected by the Council members after they assume their positions in 2014.
“In the next two days, we’re going to sleep,” said Mazen, who received 946 number one votes. “In the next two years, we’re going to catalog the campaign promises, which were specific tasks from pot-holes to bike safety, city-wide development, and small business promotion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just two weeks left in its season, the Harvard men’s soccer team (5-7-2, 4-1-0 Ivy) will look to continue its recent strong play against the Holy Cross Crusaders (7-7-1, 5-3-0 Patriot) on Wednesday.
“They always give us a good battle,” co-captain Kevin Harrington said. “They’re a pretty good team, so it should be interesting.”
The Crimson has won four of its last five games, with its success largely due to increased offensive production and stellar defensive play.
In those last five games, the team has managed to score 10 goals in total, allowing more than one goal just once in that span. Comparatively, in its first five games of the season, Harvard only managed to score four goals in total en route to a 0-4-1 start.
Such strong recent play has put Harvard on top of the Ivy League, a stark contrast to its position at this time last year, when it eventually finished last in the Ancient Eight without a single league win.
This season, however, the tides have turned. Harvard’s final two league games will determine who earns the Ancient Eight crown. A non-league matchup with the Crusaders will serve as an excellent opportunity for the team to work out any lingering problems and concerns.
Even so, the coaches and players insist that they are not treating this game any differently than an Ivy League contest.
“We’re preparing just the same as we do for every other game,” head coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We’re watching them and making improvements. We’re watching film, talking to players and getting feedback. It’s the same preparation as we have for any game.”
Continuing its season-long focus on the process of becoming a winning team, there remain a couple of key aspects that the Crimson wishes to improve.
During its hot streak, Harvard has consistently produced one half of strong play to win the game.
“We want to play our best full 90 minutes,” Harrington said. “I think the first 45 minutes [of the Dartmouth game] were great… now, our focus… is to play that way for 90 minutes and really sustain our defensive pressure, which is really the core of everything we’ve done.”
“We want to continue to keep a good work rate,” Lehrer added. “In the first half we were very strong from the attacking side. I think we just have to carry that into the second half more consistently.”
Harvard’s opponent is in a somewhat similar situation. The Crusaders have already clinched a bid for the Patriot League postseason tournament for the first time since 2008.
Unlike the Ivy League, the Patriot League utilizes a playoff format that disregards the regular season record once the teams are given their playoff seeds. Thus, despite Holy Cross’s mediocre record relative to the rest of its league, building momentum is critical for it to make a strong run in the conference tournament.
The Crusaders are looking to return to midseason form—specifically, a stretch during which they were able to capture six of eight games and run off four wins in five conference games.
Since then, however, Holy Cross has played three teams that they may see again in the conference tournament and has returned a pedestrian 1-2 record.
The Crimson features a balanced offensive attack—none of its players have amassed more than three goals on the season.
Its most potent offensive weapon, ironically, is a defender. Senior Ross Friedman has tallied a league-leading eight assists and a team-best 10 points on the year.
On the defensive end of the pitch, the Crimson has been buoyed by standout sophomore goalkeeper Evan Mendez, who has gone 5-0-1 on the year after replacing senior goalkeeper Brett Conrad.
Holy Cross has a slightly less balanced offense, as senior midfielder Monty Sanders and freshman forward Joey DeVivo have accounted for nine of the Crusaders’ 18 goals on the season. Sanders accounts for nearly one-third of his team’s 15 assists.
In net, sophomore goalkeeper Kevin Wright has been competent en route to a 7-6-1 record.
While Holy Cross has a better overall record than the Crimson, the relative strength of the two teams can also be gauged by a common opponent—in this case, Dartmouth.  The Crimson was able to notch a victory over the Big Green last Saturday, while Holy Cross only managed a tie earlier in the year.
Wednesday’s game will be the final tune-up for both teams before they continue on to their final conference games of the season. Both teams will try to continue and build on their early success in the season as they prepare to make a run at their respective conference titles. Harrington said that the team’s goal is to play an entire game up to its high standards.
“I don’t think we’ve put together a full 90 minutes that we are capable of,” Harrington said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, women’s rugby became Harvard’s 42nd varsity sport. Just this past weekend, the team claimed its first-ever Ivy League Championship title.
It seems like quite the meteoric rise. A little over two months removed from its first varsity practice, the Crimson found itself rightfully situated at the top of the Ivy League. But this wasn’t exactly the “rags to riches” season it may, at first glance, appear to be. That wouldn’t do the story, or the team, justice. It’s not for lack of success—Harvard shut out undefeated and No. 1 seeded Dartmouth, 29-0, in the Ancient Eight finals—but rather because the team didn’t really start off rag. They started off Rad.
The Harvard women’s rugby team owes its origins to the former Harvard-Radcliffe rugby football club. For nearly thirty years, the Radcliffe squad competed as a club sport, steadily working its way up the rugby ranks. The team established itself as a perennial threat in the Northeast and later captured the 1998 and 2011 national championship titles.
In 2012, the Athletic Department announced that the club team would make the transition to varsity the following year. The switch definitely brought its perks. It meant swapping midnight bubble practices for prime field time. It meant access to full-time trainers and the weight room conditioning staff. It meant department funding for transportation and hotels at away games. It gave the team the allure—and perhaps even credibility—of varsity status.
But all these additions didn’t change the foundation that was already there. The spirit of Radcliffe rugby—the dedication, energy, and overall camaraderie—persisted throughout the season even as the team took on its new form.
Nowhere was this more apparent than on the field during the Crimson’s 57-7 victory at Brown. The team entered that weekend’s contest coming off a demoralizing loss to Dartmouth the week prior. A lackluster performance had resulted in a 10-5 loss to the Big Green, the first real blow of the season.
The team wasn’t playing like they used to, and first year coach Sue Parker decided to send a message. Stripped of their varsity jerseys and gear, the Crimson practiced in old shirts and socks the week leading up to the Brown game. They walked onto the field to face the Bears wearing inside-out grey t-shirts, their numbers etched on their backs in black marker.
“I think that actually helped light a fire under some of the girls,” senior co-captain Xanni  Brown said after the game. “We were out there like we used to be, that rag-tag Radcliffe team playing in whatever t-shirts and socks we could scrounge up.”
Harvard looked like a different team, and they played like it too. With a renewed fire and energy, the Crimson dominated Brown on all sides of the field en route to the commanding victory. Radcliffe alums could hardly recall the last time Harvard came out on top against the Bears. It had been at least a decade.
The victory at Brown marked a significant turning point in the Crimson’s season. Back in their new gear but playing with that same mentality, Harvard capitalized on its newfound momentum in the final three games of its season, outscoring its opponents by an average margin of 30 points. The Crimson dominated Princeton, traditionally a top Ivy competitor, in a 39-0 victory at home. With the win, Harvard secured its berth and locked up a No. 2 seed in the Ivy League Championships.
Faced with a rematch against the Bears in the first round, the Crimson once again came out on top, 31-5, in its semifinal contest. One shutout victory against Dartmouth later and Harvard had wrapped up a historic inaugural season by capturing the coveted Ancient Eight title.
After clinching the Ivy League Championships, @RadcliffeRugby tweeted, “#allforthealums.” It was a simple gesture to the legions of Radcliffe ruggers that had paved the way over the past three decades. It was a shout-out to the dozens of recent grads who flocked the stands at games to support their former team.  But most of all, it was a testament to the spirit of Radcliffe rugby that continues to live on in the varsity squad.
