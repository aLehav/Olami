After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For every “Joe Homebody” there is an Evel Knievel. Lost in current public discourse over how and when to end emergency stay-at-home and business closure measures are important human realities — our different internal orientations to risk and security. It is important and healthy to examine how one’s internal orientation toward risk informs one’s thoughts and actions. Similarly, it is essential to understand and acknowledge others’ preferences toward risk — especially when they have different default tendencies.
Balancing different preferences toward risk and security is one of the challenges of civil society. Speed limits, airport security, food safety laws, and licensing requirements all contain some internal compromise of risk and safety. That balance is achieved through a diffuse process that plays out over time through our laws, elections, culture, and watershed events.
The challenge of the present moment is that the ethical dimensions are not diffuse, but seemingly concentrated in the hands of civic leaders: If they release emergency stay-in-place orders and allow businesses to reopen, will they be complicit in the deaths that follow? There is a tempting logic in this proposition, but it denies the complexity of the current moment and the difficulty of balancing risk and security in more normal times.
Consider our tax dollars that finance the roads on which tens of thousands of Americans die each year. We clamor for improved infrastructure, but under the logic of complicity we should be advocating for its destruction! Highway deaths are an undesirable consequence of an otherwise excellent arrangement — the rapid, inexpensive transportation of goods and people throughout the country. Thus we make rules to minimize the risk: speed limits, licensing requirements, stiff penalties for driving under the influence, and the like. We could reduce highway deaths to zero by plowing the roads under, and yet we do not, instead choosing a mélange of policies to balance risk, safety, and public benefit.
This calculus is proving difficult in the present moment. In mid-March, there was broad consensus to act with “abundance of caution” and “flatten the curve” in light of the grim projections from Imperial College and others. Now that consensus is splintering, with our different orientations toward risk and security informing our preferred balance.
It is my hope that we can find a new consensus about how to move forward. The data unmistakably show who is most at risk (the elderly) and who is least at risk (the young and healthy). The difference is stark. The latest Massachusetts state data shows that the rate of death is 1,070 per 100,000 people within the 80+ age cohort and 236 per 100,000 people for the 70-79 year-old cohort, falling to two per 100,000 people for the 30-39 cohort and zero for the younger cohorts. As a reference, the level of risk to the middle-aged cohort of 50-59 year-olds, 18 deaths per 100,000 people, is comparable to that of dying in a motor vehicle accident (around 12 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019).
It is also worth understanding that the Imperial model that catalyzed stay-at-home orders and business closure in mid-March was based on much more pessimistic death rates than have actually transpired. The Imperial model predicted the death of 2.2 million Americans by the end of July, but the current total stands at around 79,500 deaths, nowhere near on track to meet that projection.
Given the data, it is not surprising that a majority (nearly 60 percent) of Massachusetts residents who have died from the virus have been in long-term care facilities. Clearly we need more aggressive containment and screening procedures to keep the virus out of these facilities. At the same time, we should move quickly to relax restrictions on the movement of the low-risk young and healthy, allowing them to return to work and school while minimizing transmission to vulnerable populations. For those in the middle, we should continue accommodation strategies such as remote work and meetings.
These preferences, of course, are imbued with my personal balance of risk and security, which tilts toward accepting risk. The important thing is building a new consensus; a good place to start is by acknowledging our own tendencies and being understanding of them in others.

Correction: May 11, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19 were measured per 100,000 cases. In fact, the death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19 were measured in rates per 100,000 people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, in the blissful times of close human interaction, I had a conversation with my roommate (who is also black, for context) sparked by a copy of one of Professor Cornel R. West’s '74 books on my desk. They mentioned how some of their family had strongly negative opinions of the professor at least partly because of what they believe were his unfair criticisms of former President Barack Obama.
The ensuing conversation is one that we have continued to have on many occasions and with many different people. Yes, sure, the conversation was always partly about whether Obama was a good president — for black and other people — and whether the criticisms of him were valid or not. But an underlying tension in these conversations is one that has been front and center in social dialogue recently: whether or not black people have an obligation to wholly support other black people and their endeavors simply because they are black.
We constantly put pressure on ourselves, as black people, to support other black people. I know we have all felt this pressure — and likely perpetuated it too — and there are certainly boundless good reasons for it. Most prominent of which is that so much wrong has been done to black people that we feel we must band together and support each other because if we do not, no one else will.
The desire to label someone or something as definitively good or bad is seemingly universal. But it manifests itself uniquely among black people because all too often the slightest bit of — even apparent — "bad," in whatever sense is applicable, in black people is enough to condemn us as entirely bad. Stop-and-frisk data alone is proof enough of that — let alone the entire United States justice system. Thus, collectively working to protect each other from those realities is an actionable, effective solution. When our behaviors are placed in this context it sounds like — and is — a reasonable and beautiful thing. One that we should all buy in to.
But there is no such thing as a principle that won’t run into a contradiction — no matter how well-intentioned. Taking anything to its fundamentals inevitably leads to foolishness at best. And more and more often I am seeing leanings toward a form of black support fundamentalism.
This fundamentalism is manifested by us either entirely accepting people among ourselves to keep them from being seen as "bad" or entirely distancing ourselves entirely from a person to prevent us from getting judged as "bad" by contact.
Whether it be condemning those who would criticize Obama on accounts of tarnishing parts of the legacy of the first black president; or young South Africans who would distance themselves from Nelson Mandela’s legacy now because he didn’t do what was necessary to secure black peoples’ economic (and thus, other) freedom. I hear things along these lines and I — internally — giggle. Why do things have to be so binary?
The average human brain has 86 billion neurons … and you’re telling me that we can’t bring ourselves to have a nuanced view of anything or anyone with a little melanin in them?
I completely understand that it is much harder for us to have a collectively nuanced view on anything. But when has harder ever meant impossible? You’re telling me we can’t both be inspired by what Mandela contributed towards the creation of a free South Africa, and also acknowledge that he didn’t do all that was possible or necessary? That we can’t admire the leaps and bounds of progress made by Obama both in just getting elected and what he did in office, as well as respect the fact that center-left politics — no matter where it originates — can never do the most possible for all vulnerable peoples in the U.S. and beyond?
We shouldn’t have to settle for such simplistic views of anyone.
So many historical moments or figures we know have been washed by public perception to have been either great and infallible or evil and insane. And revising those perceptions is always painful and difficult, whether it be Cecil Rhodes in South Africa or the founding fathers in America. The way we can prevent the need for painful revisions of our perfect and simple histories is to write them with a nuanced perspective in real-time.
Since we have the power to be the arbiters of history going forward, let’s just do things right from the start. It’s much easier to write things accurately now than change them later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The majority of critically ill COVID-19 patients survive under current treatment guidelines for respiratory failure, clinicians at two Harvard teaching hospitals found.
The team of doctors — led by Massachusetts General Hospital pulmonologist and Harvard Medical School professor Charles C. Hardin — announced the findings in a press release Wednesday after publishing their research in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.
In the study, the nine-person team monitored and treated 66 critically ill and intubated COVID-19 patients at MGH and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for more than two weeks.
The most severe COVID-19 cases can result in a condition known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a type of life-threatening respiratory failure causing excess fluid buildup in the lung’s air sacs, the researchers found. They treated these patients with guideline-supported protocols for ARDS respiratory failure.
The death rate among COVID-19 patients treated under those ARDS protocols was 16.7 percent — which is lower than the rate reported by other hospitals, according to the press release. In intensive care units, 75.8 percent of patients on mechanical ventilators were discharged after a median follow-up time of just over a month.
“The good news is we have been studying ARDS for over 50 years and we have a number of effective evidenced-based therapies with which to treat it,” Hardin said in the press release. “We applied these treatments — such as prone ventilation where patients are turned onto their stomachs — to patients in our study and they responded to them as we would expect patients with ARDS to respond.”
As hospitals worldwide have shared anecdotal and one-off treatment strategies, the findings point to a more robust treatment strategy for critically ill COVID-19 patients, according to the release.
“Based on this, we recommend that clinicians provide evidence-based ARDS treatments to patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and await standardized clinical trials before contemplating novel therapies,” Medical School instructor and study co-author Jehan Alladina said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2020 isn’t the first year Harvard’s traditional Commencement Exercises were cancelled or postponed.
The Commencement Exercises typically include thousands of family members, faculty, and alumni crowding Harvard Yard to take part in the celebration of graduating students from the College and Harvard’s graduate schools.
The University announced it would postpone its 369th Commencement Exercises, which were originally scheduled to take place on May 28, due to the global coronavirus pandemic. The scheduled speaker was Washington Post executive editor Martin “Marty” Baron.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a message to Harvard affiliates on March 20 that it was with a “heavy heart” that he had to inform them of commencement’s postponement.
“I love seeing our community come together to celebrate the academic accomplishments of our remarkable students,” he wrote. “I love seeing their families brimming with pride as they participate in a ceremony that is almost as old as the University itself.”
Instead of the typical celebration, the University will confer degrees online until it is able to host the traditional in-person celebration. The postponed ceremony will include “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible,” per the email.
Harvard’s first commencement, held on Sept. 23, 1642, would have been partially unintelligible to a 21st-century observer. Nine commencers gave speeches and weathered oral examinations in Latin, and former University President Henry Dunster individually bestowed each degree, also delivering a Latin declaration to the overseers.
But, if aurally foreign, large parts of the ceremonies would resonate with contemporary commencements.
There were morning and afternoon exercises; a feast; a procession for the commencers, the Board of Overseers, and Massachusetts colonial officials; humorous and serious speeches alike. And there was a sense of pride—only three years earlier, Harvard had closed its doors to students due to the poor leadership of its first leader, Nathaniel Eaton, who physically abused students and embezzled money from the College.
If the first commencement was a “solemn act,” as one observer described, later commencements in the colonial era were scenes of festivity and, at times, debauchery. The few graduates at the 1703 commencement drank 14 barrels of beer; as one sophomore wrote in his diary on commencement day in 1773, “The College have been chiefly in company drinking to Day and at Night they seem to all be drunkedness and confusion.”
Commencement was, at the time, a festivity for both the College and much of the Massachusetts colony. While soon-to-be Harvard graduates went through morning and afternoon exercises, hundreds of people, many with no formal affiliation to the College, celebrated nearby.
“Imagine tents set up on Cambridge Common for food, dancing, and drinking,” Conrad E. Wright, an editor at the Massachusetts Historical Society who has studied Harvard during colonial times, wrote in an email. “Imagine wrestling competitions, bear-baiting, and gambling. For a day, the local version of Las Vegas.”
Today, the commencement festivities consist of the Morning Exercises and Afternoon Events.
Tercentenary Theatre — the site of the outdoor ceremony — is decorated with the flags of the University’s 12 graduate schools as well as the College's 13 undergraduate houses.
As the Harvard band plays songs, the President’s division, graduating class of seniors, and alumni enter the yard and take their seats. The graduates of Harvard’s professional schools enter from Sever Quadrangle, which served as the original site of the University’s Commencement Exercises until 1946.
The ceremony begins with the sheriff of Middlesex County calling the meeting to order. The chaplain then prays and the University Marshall hands it to the three student speakers: the first address given by a College senior in Latin, the second address given by a College senior in English, and the third address given by a professional degree candidate in English.
Earned and honorary degrees are then conferred by the President. At the 2019 Commencement Exercises, Bacow awarded 6,665 degrees.
Following the degree conferring, graduates return to their individual undergraduate houses or their respective schools for smaller ceremonies, where they receive their individual diplomas and celebrate with their families.
In the late afternoon, the graduates return to Tercenary Theatre for Alumni Exercises, the afternoon program. The program welcomes the graduates into the Harvard Alumni Association.
Nearly 200 years ago, in 1721, a deadly smallpox outbreak struck the Massachusetts Colony. In Boston alone, more than half the population of 11,000 was infected, and over 850 died. On June 26, the Corporation published a notice in a local newsletter, which stated “that by reason of any danger that may rise from the Small Pox’s spreading,” commencement would be a private affair.
The festivities, anticipated by hundreds of nearby colonists for months, were suddenly and swiftly upended, replaced by a solemn and private ceremony.
The first time a Harvard commencement was cancelled — more than three decades later — was also due to a plague. The College shut down for five months in 1752 in order to protect students from a smallpox outbreak, and with nobody present at the University, the Corporation voted on May 4 to cancel commencement. Instead, students were given a “General Diploma” certifying their graduation.
Commencement was cancelled eight more times in the eighteenth century, and has been held every year since 1780.
A drought, the Seven Years War, and a smallpox outbreak simultaneously struck Cambridge in 1757, putting the city through much physical and financial turmoil and making joyous festivities seem inappropriate. The Corporation voted on June 27 that, “Providences call for humiliation and fasting, rather than festival entertainments.” The class of 1757, too, received “General Diplomas” in place of a ceremony. Seven years later, another smallpox outbreak once again forced Harvard to cancel commencement.
But it was the American Revolution that had the biggest effect on eighteenth-century Harvard commencements.
The war was an especially difficult time for the College, with fighting concentrated in Massachusetts. Local crises leading up to the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, the siege of Boston in 1776, and other fighting bred general chaos and anxiety, with the College even evacuating to Concord from 1775 to 1776 as American soldiers occupied Harvard buildings.
Battle, coupled with war-induced inflation and other financial uncertainties — John Hancock, then the College’s treasurer, took thousands of pounds of Harvard’s funds with him to Philadelphia when he went to serve in the Continental Congress — meant the College was in no position to host festivities.
Citing “the present dark aspect of our public Affairs,” the Corporation voted in 1774 to cancel commencement. Commencement was cancelled each year up to and including 1780 due to general disorder and uncertainties over renewed fighting in Massachusetts, with the exception of 1779, when the College managed to hold a private ceremony.
Yet students from the Revolutionary period, despite their truncated Harvard experiences, were more engaged in public service than classes before or after the conflict. Before the war, high public offices were generally filled by British officials. After the war, Americans filed government positions and establishing charitable and philanthropic organizations.
“People, including lots of Harvard graduates, jumped at the new opportunities open to them,” Wright wrote. “At the same time, people who had put their lives and careers on the line on the American side could be excited—and patriotic—about the opportunities now in front of them to create something new, different, and enduring.”
Harvard's Commencement Office sent a message to Harvard affiliates on May 4, detailing the University-wide online events as well as the individual school’s events.
“While we look forward with great anticipation to a time when it is safe for us to honor the members of the Harvard Class of 2020 in person, we hope you will take a moment to gather with the University community online to acknowledge their accomplishments, their creativity, their kindness, and their knowledge,” the message reads.
The May 28 online celebration will include an online University-wide celebration before the individual schools host their respective virtual events. Baron will still speak at the online event, according to University Spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
Erica J. Doran ’05, who serves as the Class of 2005’s secretary, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Commencement Exercises embody the “spirit, energy, and inspiration of the Harvard community.”
“From iconic Commencement speeches in Harvard Yard to more intimate house ceremonies, there is a strong shared sense of pride and tradition across the events,” she wrote. “The graduating class offers hope and fresh perspective, while reunion classes gather together to reminisce and share experiences from all walks of life.”
University Spokesperson Christopher A. Hennessy confirmed that the Harvard Alumni Association is planning virtual programming for the upcoming College alumni reunions that will take place in late May and early June.
University donor Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60 said he hopes Harvard honors this year’s graduates in a special way.
“My heart goes out to the seniors,” Buttenwieser said. “I just feel like they had the last two months of their whole life at Harvard truncated, not really having the chance to say goodbye or really celebrate with their classmates, have a really wonderful ending of senior year and then Commencement with their families.”
He added that he hopes the University will help students who may not have the financial means to come back to commencement otherwise.
“Harvard gives special funds to those parents to come up and travel to Cambridge and put them up over Commencement,” he said. “I’ve had some friends whose families really benefited from that.”
Doran, who is a former Crimson president, added that she encourages alumni to “rally around not only the Class of 2020 but all current undergraduates.”
“The Harvard alumni community should offer wisdom, friendship and compassion as these students embark on their unique journeys across the world during an unprecedented and challenging time,” Doran wrote. “We pride ourselves on our global citizenship and now is the time to fully embrace it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Government professor Daniel P. Carpenter called for a "new New Deal" to jumpstart the American economy in a white paper published in late April.
Co-authored by Carpenter and Ohio State University professor Darrick Hamilton, the paper argues that the U.S. government should adopt a number of public policy measures to redress economic losses suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Specifically, Hamilton and Carpenter — the director of social sciences at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study — called for the federal government to provide a federal job guarantee by directly hiring millions of workers in the coming two years. They argued such a measure would rejuvenate the workforce and “inject diversity and youth into a system that sorely needs it.”
“There is nothing well-timed about any crisis, especially one that carries thousands to their graves and leaves others physically and emotionally scarred,” the authors wrote. “Yet the imperative for direct government hiring comes at a time when government workforces nationwide are losing vast numbers of workers.”
“As Baby Boomers retire, government is experiencing what is sometimes called a silver tsunami, with mass retirements from civil service at the local, state, and federal levels,” they added.
In the paper, the authors described how their proposal mirrors similar programs adopted during the Great Depression, including the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps.
“The proposal here builds on and meshes with the ideas of others,” Carpenter and Hamilton wrote. “The obvious precedent rests in many public hiring programs that exist in American and world history, most notably the New Deal.”
The pair proposed various methods by which the federal government could create new positions — including creating jobs specifically focused on fighting the pandemic.
“Constructing and staffing new health clinics and creating comprehensive testing for COVID-19 and subsequent pandemics would bring another 500,000 or more jobs,” Carpenter and Hamilton wrote in an editorial on the white paper published in Slate this week.
In the Slate article, Carpenter and Hamilton also argued against the efficacy of stimulus funds.
“The current focus on stimulus is deeply flawed, reproducing inequality by cutting taxes for businesses and thereby conveying billions to the already wealthy,” they wrote. “As stimulus funds work their way through corporations, contractors, and small-business lenders, workers get an ever-smaller share of the pie.”
While Carpenter and Hamilton acknowledged the federal government has already undertaken some measures to assist families and small businesses — such as extending unemployment benefits and offering extensive loans — they argued that direct government employment is a crucial piece of the federal response that has so far been neglected.
“The multidimensional crisis unfolding with the global coronavirus pandemic calls for a multidimensional solution,” they wrote in the white paper. “We are confronting problems that trillions in central bank loans, hundreds of billions in small business support, and vast new extensions of unemployment insurance, while valuable, are simply no match for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Packages and bikes went missing in April as Cambridge residents stayed home.
Total crime increased 21 percent during the month of April compared to the previous month, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s monthly crime report. Property crime increased by 22 percent and violent crime increased by 13 percent, including the city's first murder in over 15 months.
The numbers come during the continued spread of the coronavirus, which has prompted Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 to extend a statewide stay-at-home advisory from May 4 to May 18.
In Cambridge alone, there have been 840 positive cases and 69 COVID-19 deaths as of May 10.
Property crime surged by 22 percent as thieves targeted bike racks, vehicles, and residential door steps. Last month, break-ins of motor vehicles skyrocketed from 10 incidents in March to 34 incidents and bike thefts rose from 22 incidents to 34 incidents.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said the department published a notice on its website in mid-April warning the public of an increase in package thefts and car break-ins.
“There were kind of larger scale operations going on, particularly with package thefts,” Warnick said in an interview. “In one case, we had a suspect going into lobbies of apartment dwellings, grabbing handfuls of boxes, bringing them out to a car which was being driven by another perpetrator, and going back into other dwellings.”
Violent crime also increased slightly during the month of April, from 16 cases in March to 18 cases last month. On April 23, CPD reported a homicide case on Harvard Avenue, where a suspect was arrested for fatally stabbing a homeless man.
Still, April saw a slight decrease in total criminal incidents compared to last year. April 2019 saw 175 incidents; 156 incidents occurred last month.
In response to the pandemic, CPD and emergency services in Cambridge have taken precautions to curb the spread of the virus among employees. In late March, the department transitioned many services over the phone and restructured officers’ work hours to longer but fewer shifts. CPD has also deferred many of its calls to the Cambridge Fire Department as well as Pro EMS, the city’s local ambulance provider.
