After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday I turned nineteen, and the summer marches on like a heartbeat.
Of the many literary journeys I’ve taken over the past two months, Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple” spoke to me like few others works have. Chronicling the parallel lives of two sisters bound by the forces of unfettered love, it whispers powerful words of hope and empowerment alongside its vivid descriptions of heart-wrenching struggle.
Walker’s magnum opus cuts deep into the social fabric of the early 20th-century American South, exposing the physical and emotional bloodshed of the black women who shaped it. Simultaneously, it paints provocative images of postcolonial West Africa tainted by centuries of internalized oppression.
And in its raw portrayals of life at the nadir of multiple social ladders, Walker proffers a path to freedom molded by none other than a collective resilience, a will to love one another amidst what seems like inescapable desolation.
If Charlotte Bronte’s “Jane Eyre” is protofeminist, Walker’s “The Color Purple” is womanist — celebrating irrevocable bonds among strong, capable women who find themselves shackled by intersecting layers of abuse at the hands of the men in their lives.
Just one day after finishing the novel, I began a whirlwind of a week mentoring a group of high school girls at a political leadership program. Tasked with ensuring these young women felt comfortable and confident throughout the week, I facilitated nightly discussions to reflect on the preceding day’s events.
“Empowered women empower women,” one young woman told the rest of us on the first night. “So don’t be afraid to share your gift with others.”
Immediately, my mind flashed back to “The Color Purple,” in which the empowerment of the main character, Celie, entirely depends on the women around her — each of whom uses her own feelings of empowerment to build Celie up and help her realize her self-worth. Each woman leads by example, harnessing her own aspirations to bolster Celie’s self-confidence and help find her voice.
Though it portrays the lives of women of color in the early 20th-century South, “The Color Purple” resonates well-beyond its immediate setting. Through universal themes of love and sacrifice, Walker’s book transcends its time and tou ches lives across the spectrum of color and class. And when it touched mine nearly four decades after its publication, it left a message loud and clear: As women, we must build each other up instead of tearing each other down.
My week at the young women’s leadership program was a breeding ground for Walker’s message. In the absence of their male counterparts, the girls were tasked with stepping up to a plate from which women have long shied away. They participated in a mock legislature, political party convention, and presidential election, simulating the processes of American government and taking steps to uplift one another as each debated bills, casted votes, and ran for office.
But a few young women opted to take the competition beyond the ballot box. I watched them thinly veil verbal attacks on one another with saccharine niceties. I saw them bandage their own insecurities by feasting on each other’s vulnerabilities. And perhaps most damagingly, I witnessed their subtle exclusion of one another from conversations, denying one another a voice in a space meant to afford each woman her own unique one.
This brand of emotional destruction among women and girls is universal. It regularly seeps into casual conversations between women who sniff out each other’s weaknesses, wage concealed threats in the form of false compliments, and refuse to engage in honest discussions to address problems by instead resorting to malicious gossip.
While the question of why women tear each other down is a complex one largely rooted in centuries-old patriarchal systems and isn’t exclusive to women, the answer to how to rectify such damaging behavior is more straightforward. In addition to pushing for structural and institutional gender equality, we as women need to lift one another up in our personal interactions.
We need to empower each other in ways that transcend the verbal banner of gender equality. We need to push feminism beyond the confines of its eight letters. Unless we do, our cause will culminate in a Pyrrhic victory.
Whether it’s choosing candor over clandestinity, celebrating the strengths of our female companions, or honoring the principles of sisterhood, we may look to “The Color Purple” as a guiding light.
In portraying unconditional love amongst women who could all-too-easily choose to resent one another, Walker not only paints each of their dynamic stories in the color purple, but weaves them together in a rainbow of solidarity. And, in the end, this very union is what makes her book that much more powerful, that much more timeless.
Yesterday, I celebrated my nineteenth birthday by attending the Broadway musical based on Walker’s novel. I celebrated what life has brought me this past year, beginning with the powerful bonds I’ve developed with the women around me.
In many ways, the last 12 months have changed me profoundly. But in some ways, I’m the same.
I’m still an optimist. I still believe in sisterhood. My favorite color is still purple.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, like many other anxious ’19ers, I’ve glimpsed the specter of the Great Beyond. Post-graduation plans and the conversations around them have grown increasingly concrete and angsty. In Annenberg, we philosophized about how best to balance personal passions, altruistic motivations, and “practical” things like money and resume-building. Now, we stare soberly at the search results on Crimson Careers and note how few of them meet even two of those criteria. Maybe we wonder whether the underclassman cliche that “you could always do finance or consulting!” is still true. Would it be so bad to “sell out” — to postpone our dreams of changing the world and secure our financial footing?
I fear that framing the decision this way — reducing the dizzying variety of post-graduation pursuits to “selling out” versus “not selling out” — we obscure the real ethical distinctions.
For one, some forms of “selling out” are better than others. Many graduates “sell out” by taking a job in a management consulting firm. Despite the “snake” stereotype, 80,000 Hours — the career-advice wing of the Centre for Effective Altruism — rates consulting as one of the best jobs for beginning a career of doing good. On their analysis, consultants gain transferable skills and connections while potentially even positively impacting the world (though they admit considerable uncertainty about its direct impact). “Sellouts” who head west, or a couple miles east, and work for tech firms also appear to be acting justifiably for similar reasons.
Indeed, classical economics holds that a high income actually corresponds directly with doing good for society. After all, people usually give you money insofar as you do something useful for them, and something is “useful” for a business if it produces something its customers want. But this assumes a world of perfectly competitive and free markets — and even those would heavily prioritize the utility of the wealthy, especially over that of the global poor. For that reason, the effective altruists add a key demand for consultants and tech workers: Rather than simply reaping the rewards of their economic contributions, they must “earn to give,” committing a substantial share of their salary to the world’s most effective charities.
And speaking of non-competitive markets, “selling out” also might mean working at a bank that helped cause the financial crisis. (No, that was not a result of unfettered capitalism.) As many Goldman matriculants surely know, these banks took massive risks that ensnared the entire economy, likely resting on the correct assumption that the securities industry’s enormous lobbying budget would ensure a bailout — creating a grave moral hazard and increasing the risk that such a catastrophe would happen again. By continuing to pour their talent into these institutions, these Harvard graduates contribute to their undeserved return to business-as-usual. (80,000 Hours rates work that makes the financial system highly risky the seventh-most harmful career.)
Contrary to popular perception, the effective altruists do not recommend that everyone follow an “earning to give” strategy, especially in harmful industries. They also warn against front-office finance jobs more generally, given their high burnout, low job satisfaction, and uncertain direct impact. Law school seems to evade the “sellout” charge, but 80,000 Hours is bearish on commercial law — and how many prospective public-interest lawyers stick to those plans when they start the senior-year process again as a 3L, now confronting six figures of law school debt? Some do, and some don’t.
That brings me to what might be an even more important distinction: people who “sell out” versus people who sell out.
Much of the criticism of the sellout path, including the Marina E. Keegan essay “Even Artichokes Have Doubts,” laments the wasted potential of the starry-eyed idealists lured by the well-worn path and prestige of finance and consulting. “How can I change the world as a 21- or 22-year-old?” asks Annie, a banker-to-be. “I know that’s a very pessimistic view, but I don’t feel like I have enough knowledge or experience to step into those shoes. Even if you know that you want to go into the public sector you’d benefit from experience in the private sector.” Keegan rebuts that point by quoting professors on the supposedly soul-killing nature of these jobs, but for moral purposes, I think we should take Annie seriously.
Even if it “wastes” the (limited) potential of their first few years, it seems very plausible that the people who actually follow through — who donate most of their seven-figure hedge-fund salary, who fundraise from their McKinsey network to start an international development NGO — made the right decision. But when 80,000 Hours encourages these professions by giving them high scores for “career capital” and “earning to give” potential, they make an assumption so obvious you might miss it: That the reader’s motivations are altruistic and permanent.
That raises another problem with the discourse around “selling out”: It splits graduates into two putative groups. One follows its principles straight out of Johnston Gate; the other strictly looks out for number one. I worry that, by asking that second group to justify “selling out” to their peers and themselves, we encourage them to redefine their values to justify a career with no ethical commitments at all. (For theoretical support, I cite “social creativity,” the phenomenon of group members changing what attributes they value to increase their self-esteem.)
At the risk of sounding presumptuous, then, I propose ethically-concerned seniors replace their scowls of disgust at hearing “sellout” plans with an actually less self-righteous reaction: “You could probably do a lot of good with that.” They could! And we should make it a strong social norm that they do.
Our careers will be, God willing, long. So, if you need consulting or law school or some other signaling-and-networking launch pad to get to a place you actually want to be, whether that’s a startup, an NGO, policymaking (which 80,000 Hours heartily endorses), or repaying your loans (or your family), I think you should go for it. The risk is that once you enter that world of optionality, high pay, and prestige, you get so comfortable that you never leave. All these justifications are for naught if you truly do sell out — if you completely abandon your dreams, and indeed your moral obligations, of giving something back to the world that has given you so much.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chapter of the Delta Gamma sorority is closing its doors — making it the first single-gender group to shut down in response to the College’s social group penalties.
The national Delta Gamma organization announced the move in a press release Thursday and explicitly cited the sanctions as the impetus for the decision.
The College’s policy, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender final clubs, fraternities, and sororities from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, captaining varsity athletic teams, and receiving College endorsement for a number of prestigious fellowships.
“We respect the chapter’s decision and understand that the University’s sanctions resulted in an environment in which Delta Gamma could not thrive,” Wilma Johnson Wilbanks, Delta Gamma’s national president, wrote in a press release. “We sincerely hope this changes in the future.”
The national group’s vote came after the Cambridge Area Zeta Phi chapter of the sorority, the group active on Harvard’s campus, voted to “relinquish its charter” in May, per the press release. The Fraternity Council, the group’s governing body, then unanimously voted to accept the Cambridge chapter’s request to close.
While Delta Gamma is the first group to close in response to the sanctions, other single-gender social groups have made fundamental changes to club policies — including membership composition — to avoid the College’s penalties.
Last week, Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta announced it would go gender-neutral in the fall, disaffiliating with its national organization. In January, the previously all-female sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma became the co-ed Fleur-de-Lis.
In the fall of 2017, fraternities Kappa Sigma and Alpha Epsilon Pi left their national organizations to become the co-ed clubs the KS and Aleph, respectively. The Oak Club, Sablière Society, Seneca, and Spee Club have also chosen to give up their single-gender membership policies over the past three years.
Delta Gamma’s decision to close represents an about-face from its earlier position, when the group defiantly announced this spring that it did not plan to adopt major changes in response to the sanctions.
After the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, chose to adopt the sanctions in Dec. 2017 — marking the conclusion of nearly two years of doubts and debate — the group joined sororities Kappa Alpha Theta and Alpha Phi in signing a statement announcing all three groups would continue to hold all-female recruitment in the spring of 2018.
Interest in sorority rush, however, sank to an historic low this past academic year. The number of College students aiming to join sorority recruitment in the spring fell by approximately 60 percent from previous years. The 2018 rush marked the first time the sanctions affected some sorority hopefuls.
The potential impact of the College’s sanctions on all-female social groups at Harvard has been a topic of controversy for years. In March, College administrators announced they would not pursue a previously proposed “bridge” program that would have allowed traditionally all-female social groups a longer period of time to transition to gender-neutral membership.
Instead, Harvard announced that it would allocate resources and personnel — including the Harvard College Women’s Center — specifically to help women’s groups make the move to co-ed status.
In a statement, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not directly respond to Delta Gamma’s comments about the College’s sanctions.
“Harvard College seeks to build a community in which every student can thrive, and it does so on the foundation of a set of shared values including belonging, inclusion, and non-discrimination,” Dane wrote. “The policy on Unrecognized Single-Gender Social Organizations (USGSO) is designed to dedicate resources to those organizations that are advancing principles of inclusivity, while offering them supportive pathways as they transform into organizations that align with the educational philosophy, mission, and values of the College.”
Dane added that University administrators view the policy as necessary to protect inclusivity on campus.
Then-University President Drew G. Faust and William F. Lee ’72, Senior Fellow of the Corporation, wrote in Dec. 2017 that single-gender social groups “stand in the way of our ability to provide a fully challenging and inclusive educational experience to the diverse students currently on our campus.”
In the press release, Wilbanks wrote she hopes the “conditions for single-gender organizations improve” in Cambridge and that, under those circumstances, it is the national Delta Gamma organization’s “sincere hope” to reopen a chapter in Cambridge.
“This decision does not mean that we are succumbing to the University’s new sanctions and policies regarding participation in unrecognized single-gender organizations like ours,” she wrote. “We will continue to champion our right to exist on campuses everywhere. We believe the value of sorority is too great.”
Margaret W. Wilson ’19, president of Harvard’s Delta Gamma chapter, declined to further comment on the group’s decision to close, referring reporters to the national organization’s press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little over a year after the flame of Les Sablons’ kitchen brought the historic 1912 Conductor’s Building “to life,” the upscale French restaurant cooled off its stove tops for the last time Thursday.
A message on Les Sablons’ website gave no reason for the restaurant’s closure, instead thanking its staff and patrons.
“We look forward to seeing all your familiar faces at our sister restaurants throughout New England,” the statement reads.
Run by Boston restaurateurs Garrett Harker, Shore Gregory, Skip Bennett, and Jeremy Sewall, the restaurant occupied the only surviving structure from Cambridge’s earliest subway system.
The partners are known for a number of popular New England eateries, including Branch Line, Eastern Standard, Island Creek Oyster Bar and Row 34.
Nicole Kanner, a spokesperson for the restaurant, declined to provide further comment.
During its year of operation, Les Sablons served as the Square’s only French-style restaurant and one of a few high-end options.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said at the time of the Les Sablons’ opening that she thought the restaurant could fill a unique niche as a spot for cocktails and small plates after work.
The restaurant also occupied a “unique” building in the thin, narrow brick structure at 2 Bennett St.
The Conductor’s Building had previously served as administrative offices for the Boston Elevated Railway, the earliest version of the Cambridge Subway system.
Developers renovated the building in 2014, paving the way for Les Sablons to move in. The restaurant occupied two stories, with a bar and seating downstairs and the main dining area upstairs.
Gregory wrote at the time that the restaurant had been interested in a Harvard Square location for almost a year.
“We’re honored to have the opportunity to bring the Conductor’s Building to life,” Gregory said at the time. “Its significance was never lost on us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Professor Bharat N. Anand ’88 will be Harvard’s next vice provost for advances in learning, the University announced Tuesday.
Anand has served as the the faculty chair of HBX, the Business School’s digital learning initiative, since 2013 and participated in the program’s creation. In his new role, he will oversee programs like the online HarvardX platform and the Harvard Initiative for Teaching and Learning, which offers grants for education innovation.
Anand said in a statement that he is looking forward to his new position and the broad scope of opportunity in the field of improving higher education.
“Harvard has been a hotbed of innovations in pedagogy and learning during the last few years,” he said. “It’s a good time to take stock of what we’ve learned from these various projects and how this might inform our future efforts.”
Anand will succeed Peter K. Bol, who has served as the vice provost since the position was created five years ago. Bol, a professor of East Asian Languages, announced in January that he planned to step down at the end of the summer, but will remain at Harvard to continue his teaching and research.
Bol said in a statement that Anand was an “invaluable” advisor during Bol’s own tenure as vice provost, and that he is well-prepared for the role.
“I know of no one who has a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges of open-access online learning,” Bol said. “He had great success in establishing HBX as the very best platform for online business education.”
Anand is one of a number of appointments made this summer as Lawrence S. Bacow begins his term as the University’s 29th president, ushering in administrative turnover across the University. Earlier this month, the University announced Claudine Gay would serve as the next Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
