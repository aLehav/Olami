After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday in Beijing to discuss efforts to combat climate change and invited the Chinese leader to visit Harvard’s campus on a future trip to the United States.
Faust, who has also appeared at a “Your Harvard” alumni event since arriving in China, said she hopes Harvard faculty can work with Chinese scholars to research climate change.
“Addressing climate change, educating the next generation of leaders and supporting faculty research across disciplines into a host of problems facing China and the world are issues of deep mutual interest,” Faust said in a statement to The Crimson. “They are also areas in which Harvard's faculty and students can fruitfully collaborate with scholars and policy makers in China over the coming years."
Harvard has collaborated with Chinese academia before. For over 20 years, Harvard researchers have worked with faculty at many Chinese universities through the Harvard China Project, a group based at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences focused on researching the environment and energy in China.
During the meeting, Faust also extended an invitation for Xi to visit Harvard.
“We look forward to welcoming President Xi to Harvard,” Faust said in the statement to The Crimson. “It is through continuous dialogue and exchanges of information and views that can we can make progress on the issues that are important to our University, to the people of China, and to the world.”
Faust has historically stressed the importance of research as a means to address climate change, especially when discussing whether the University should divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels, a move Faust has routinely deemed neither “warranted or wise.”
Next on Faust’s China itinerary is a speech Tuesday morning at Tsinghua University centered on the topic of climate change and how universities can address it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a season filled with top-ten finishes as a squad, the Harvard skiing team sent two of its own to the NCAA Championships at Lake Placid, N.Y.
Senior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci and sophomore Rachel Hampton traveled just shy of the Canadian border to compete against the best in the nation this past weekend, returning to Cambridge with solid performances and experience under their belts.
“With Rachel…a lot of what we tried to accomplish in that first trip to NCAA’s is just getting used to the next level of competition,” Nordic coach Christopher City said. “It’s a much more competitive, very deep and talented field so I was pleased with her skiing.
“[With] Akeo, we missed a couple of opportunities,” he continued. “They were solid results definitely good enough to be proud of but I know he had higher goals going into that.”
This is the second time that Maifeld-Carucci has competed at the NCAA Championships after racing in Park City, Utah the year before. The Bozeman, Mont. native finished his collegiate career with solid performances in both the 20K Classic MS race and the 10K freestyle competition.
The senior started day one with a top-25 finish in the men’s 10K freestyle, crossing the finish line with a time of 27:10.8, just 0.1 seconds behind Dartmouth’s Fabian Stocek. Maifeld-Carucci was just less than a minute away from a top-five finish in what was a very tight spread despite having wax issues with his skis, forcing him to race with just one good ski after the first lap.
On the second day of competition, Maifeld-Carucci crossed the line with a time of 59:53.7 in the men’s 20K Classic MS, good for a 31st place overall finish and less than a minute away from the top-25 finish mark. The senior would finish with six total points on the weekend.
While Maifeld-Carucci was not able to meet the expectations he had going into the competition and now graduates, City nonetheless believes that the senior’s career and success will extend beyond his time in a Crimson uniform.
“I’m still really pleased with the way he skied there,” City said. “It’s the end of his career here [but] I don’t think it’s the end of his ski career…what a tremendous contribution he’s made especially over the last two seasons.”
On the other side of the competition. NCAA-debutant Rachel Hampton opened her competition with a 36th-place finish in the women’s 5K freestyle, crossing the finish line with a time of 16:01.1.
“I was supper happy,” Hampton said. “I really wanted to go to [Nationals] and as a sophomore kind of just test the water and see what I could do this year against girls that are really amazing…I think I went after it and I’m really proud of the way I raced.”
On day two of the Championships, Hampton clocked in with a time of 52:47.3 in the women’s 15K classic MS, placing her in 31st and just over a minute away from finishing inside the top-25. The sophomore was one slot away from finishing in a points-obtaining position, with the top-30 in every race awarded with points.
The two Nordic skiers would combine to give the Crimson a total of six points, good for a 21st-place finish and ahead of St. Olaf’s College and Bowdoin College. With the NCAA Championships now behind them, the team wraps up their season; while this season ends, the preparations for the next one begin.
While the team loses Maifeld-Carucci to graduation, Hampton hopes to use her experiences at Lake Placid to lead the team and return to Nationals with an even bigger squad next year.
“The team aspect is huge for next year,” Hampton said. “I would really like to see our girls team send three people to NCAAs…and pushing to try to get into the top-15. There’s no reason not to aim high, so we might as well go for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is going to get a little vague and philosophical. It will be interesting, maybe even insightful, but not necessarily compelling. So let’s start small, as small as we can get. Let’s start with the flick of the wrist—co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi’s wrist, to be specific.
That wrist sent the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-7, 11-3 Ivy League) dancing Saturday when Moundou-Missi hit the game-winning shot with seven seconds left in the Ivy League Playoff game against Yale. As important as the forward’s arm was in that moment, his head was just as vital.
Seconds before, Moundou-Missi had missed a potential go-ahead shot from his favorite spot on the floor, along the baseline to the left of the basket. In what Crimson coach Tommy Amaker called a “nailbiter” of a game, Moundou-Missi literally bit his thumb in frustration at the miss. When he released that shot, he thought it was going in. It rimmed out. A long review to determine whom the rebound caromed off of gave Moundou-Missi even more time to think about the ramifications of his miss.
To understand what happened next, you have to go back three months to the nadir of Harvard’s season and maybe Moundou-Missi’s career.
Remember, the Crimson entered this year ranked in the top-25, with ESPN listing two of its players among the best in the country. There was talk of at-large bids and Harvard being the best mid-major program in the country. All of that talk was gone by the end of December, as was Moundou-Missi’s jumper, evidently.
The forward shot just 26 percent during that month, including a stretch when he shot a combined 6-for-34 against Vermont, Boston University, Virginia, and Arizona State.
“Obviously the month of December was really tough,” Moundou-Missi said Monday before the team left for Jacksonville, Fla., where it will face North Carolina Thursday in the NCAA Tournament.
It was hard for the whole team, which shot 38.2 percent for the month. Harvard averaged 15 fewer points than it had in November, when it played easier competition. It lost its fifth game on Jan. 24 after losing five games all of last year.
In January, Moundou-Missi took 2.4 fewer shots per game and he went to the free throw line less than half as much as he did in December, signs of a waning confidence. He needed a pep talk and those around him saw it.
“The more you take it, the more you make it,” sophomore Corbin Miller told Moundou-Missi in one of those moments.
“Shoot the ball when you’re open,” Amaker consistently implored him.
Moundou-Missi shot the ball when he was open Saturday. It went in. The crowd stormed the court. The players celebrated. And later, a reporter (not me, I swear) asked Amaker a question at the post-game press conference:
“Do you feel like this team has had to carry the weight of this program’s success?”
Amaker responded: “Yeah, I think that’s a great statement and analysis of our program.”
You could see this team grapple with that weight early in the year. At a press conference earlier this season, senior Wesley Saunders rattled off all of the great leaders he’s played with. There was Oliver McNally ’13 and Keith Wright ’13 when he was a freshman, now-assistant coach Christian Webster ’14 when he was a sophomore, and Laurent Rivard ’14, Kyle Casey ’13-’14, and Brandyn Curry ’13-’14 last season.
When Saunders was done speaking, someone in the room (not me, again, I promise) chimed in: I guess you guys are the leaders now, huh?
He took a second, smiled and responded, “Yeah, I guess so.”
The seniors might have struggled with their new leadership duties early in the year, but they found them in time. After the loss to Dartmouth, senior Jonah Travis and his classmates spoke vigorously to the other players in closed team meetings, and Moundou-Missi, Saunders, and others could often be seen instructing and encouraging teammates during timeouts by the end of the year. Quiet players in past years, they became the heart of the team. Players like freshman Andre Chatfield will now rattle off their names in the years to come.
Moundou-Missi got his form back too. In February, his shots per game went back to its normal average and he made nearly twice as many as he did in December. He starting drawing more fouls again. In March, he looked even better, jumping up to 13 shots per game and 13 points per game.
Throughout the month of February, when the Crimson went 7-1, Amaker always talked about how his team was improving and gelling.
“I think you’ve seen the growth in all of our players within our program,” he said, “And Steve has embodied that as much as anyone.”
Moundou-Missi, for his part, credited his teammates for keeping him confident.
“They really trust me with that outside shot and really trust me to take and make those shots,” he said. “I really feed off those guys so I’m really thankful for my team.”
And this is where I’d like to get a little philosophical, if you do not mind.
We writers like to write a lot about games and numbers. It’s really a tendency all newspeople have. We cover the unveiling of bridges when what’s really happening is the building of the thing. And in basketball, we cover games, which is really just a reflection of how good a team is. Just like a doctor might look at the readouts during a check-up, it’s only a quantification of a snapshot.
Games are what people are interested in, sure, but they are not necessarily the most important part of a team’s storyline. And that’s particularly the case this year. Look at the list of games and what do you see? A bunch of W’s and L’s. I’ll even let you read the recaps for the games. It’s still just seems random. But it’s not.
Amaker knows this. All year he’s been talking about improving, the type of present participle that streams from coaches’ mouths but must get dammed somewhere before making it into print. He’s a process-over-results guy, like most coaches. And this year, the process was more interesting than the results—how Moundou-Missi went from where he was in December to the decision to take the game-winning shot, and make it, Saturday.
Amaker and his players never lost sight of the their goal of growth. Through wins and losses, they always worked to get better. The coach knew all along that would lead to good results.
“I like that about our ball club, that we’re still working to improve,” Amaker said after a game earlier this season. “If teams can adopt that mentality and that attitude, I like to think there really are good things in store.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men's basketball team (22-7, 11-3 Ivy league) prepares to face the University of North Carolina (24-11, 11-7 ACC) Saturday, Crimson staff writer Jacob D. H. Feldman got in touch with a reporter on the Tar Heels beat to learn about this year's Carolina squad. Here's what Ross Martin, a writer/editor for CarolinaBlue.com, had to say:
JDHF: What is the biggest difference between the UNC team that slid during the last ten games of the regular season and the one that made it to the ACC final?
RM: Shot making, the emergence of Brice Johnson, and toughness to close out games. UNC shot 45.5 percent from three in the win over Louisville and 50.0 percent from long range against Virginia. Junior forward Brice Johnson had 53 points combined in the three tournament wins and became a consistent and reliable inside threat on the offensive end. Against the Cardinals and Cavaliers, UNC was able to make stops down the stretch and nail free throws in the final minute to seal the big tournament wins, something they have struggled with all season.
JDHF: The Tar Heels played an absolutely brutal schedule this year, including seven non-conference games against tournament teams (is that right?), one of which was undefeated Kentucky. Did that help or hurt this team? How so?
RM: Yeah that's right. Kentucky, Ohio State, UCLA, Davidson, Iowa, UAB, and Butler. UNC went 5-2 in those games. I think the game against Kentucky and to a lesser sense Iowa (games they both lost) just illustrated the level that this UNC team needed to be playing at in order to beat the best. You have to play mistake free basketball and be consistent on offense and defense to have a chance.
I think what has prepared UNC the most is the ACC schedule. The Tar Heels played No. 1 seed Duke twice, No. 2 seed UVA twice, No. 4 seed Louisville three times, and No. 8 seed N.C. State twice (a team some are national analysts are picking to reach the Sweet Sixteen). UNC has played and beaten some of the best teams in the nation, so that toughness and confidence is huge heading into the tournament.
JDHF: What has given UNC trouble in its losses?
RM: Turnovers have been a big issue for this team. They are a little loose with the ball and sometimes make passes they shouldn't. Despite the showing in the ACC tournament, outside shooting has been a weakness throughout the season. Traditionally, North Carolina is thought of as a potent offensive machine, but this season the Heels have struggled at times to score. In the regular season, North Carolina really lacked a go-to scorer who could drop 18-20 points night in and night out.
JDHF: What has been the theme of this season for the Tar Heels?
RM: It’s a talented team that has been inconsistent and has had trouble closing out games. Despite the big conference tournament run, the Tar Heels have let some games go in the last three minutes. (most notably the 92-90 overtime loss to Duke and the 78-68 loss at Louisville where UNC led by 18 in the second half). They are a big team that can be great inside. UNC can be outstanding on the offensive boards and have won games based on second chance scoring opportunities. They are a deep team that, when healthy, can go 10 deep.
JDHF: What makes Marcus Paige such a threat? How critical is he to the team's success?
RM: Paige is undoubtedly the leader and heartbeat of this team. When he is orchestrating the offensive, driving to the basket, and his shots are dropping, UNC is so much better. His scoring is critical because North Carolina really lacks another consistent perimeter scorer. He a very good on the ball defender and smart player on both ends of the floor.
JDHF: Who is the X-factor for Carolina?
RM: Freshman Justin Jackson had a coming out party in the ACC tournament semi-final win over Virginia where he scored 22 points on 8-10 shooting (4-5 from three). That game was his eighth straight game scoring in double figures. If he can knock down two or three threes it takes the pressure off of Paige and really opens things up inside. Jackson can be the second perimeter scorer UNC really needs.
JDHF: What kind of game do you expect Thursday? Got a prediction?
RM: From the UNC side, I think the Tar Heels will try to beat Harvard with their athleticism and size. North Carolina recruits a different level player than the Crimson and they will try to look take advantage of mismatches offensively. Look for the Tar Heels to pound the ball inside early and establish Johnson and center Kennedy Meeks from the start. They will also push the ball on the break to increase the number of possessions and ramp up the pace of the game.
I can see UNC struggling with a solid defensive team like Harvard. The Tar Heels have had periods of inept scoring this season, so an experienced team defense could pose problems. Turnovers are a weakness and if the Tar Heels can't hold on to the ball it could be closer than expected.
UNC 72, Harvard 59

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Ivy League championship in hand, the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-7, 11-3 Ivy) has set its attention squarely on first-round foe North Carolina (24-11, 11-7 Atlantic Coast Conference). Before the Crimson kick off its fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament campaign Thursday in Jacksonville, Fla., The Back Page takes a look at what online prediction markets are saying about the Crimson’s chances.
FiveThirtyEight: The FiveThirtyEight model, which liked the Crimson’s chances a lot in recent years, has given Harvard just a 13 percent chance to advance. This model includes in its analysis a team’s preseason ranking, giving UNC (sixth) and Harvard (25th) a boost. Like most other models, FiveThirtyEight likes the Crimson’s chances if it can get past UNC, giving it nearly a 40 percent chance to beat its third round opponent.
Las Vegas: The most notable online sportsbook, Bovada, opened with Harvard +10.5 and the line has barely moved since it was first set. Lines at other books are similar, ranging from -9.5 to -11 down the Strip. According to Oddsshark.com, early action is favoring UNC—with 69 percent of early bets taking the Tar Heels with the spread and barely any action on the over-under of 133. On the year, Harvard has been a dismal bet, going just 9-14 against the spread (ATS), including losing records both at home and away. North Carolina, by contrast, has been an ATS darling, going 19-15-1 (11-5 on the road) and 7-3 in its last 10, which included upsets of Louisville and Virginia.
TeamRankings/NumberFire: ESPN’s insider account hosts information from the two sites, which both favor Harvard at the initial odds. TeamRankings gives Harvard a 52-percent chance to cover its +10 line and NumberFire is even more bullish, giving the Crimson a 61-percent chance and nabbing the over on the total points as well.
KenPom: Harvard, which ranked among Ken Pomeroy’s top-40 teams in the country before getting demolished in Virginia, has slipped all the way down to No. 78 entering the tournament. It is the second-lowest 13 seed, coming in 15 spots behind Valpariso of the Horizon League, but ranks ahead of 12 seeds Wofford and Wyoming. Of interest to Crimson fans: UNC lost to Pitt, ranked two spots below Harvard, by 13 points earlier this year.
Public Consensus: On Yahoo’s personal bracket site, only seven percent of users have picked Harvard to beat UNC. ESPN’s users are slightly more bullish, with just over 10 percent picking the Crimson (slightly below the 15 percent chance the site’s model gives Harvard).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard sailing team took on yet another snowstorm, sending contingents to the Friis Trophy Team Race and the NEISA-MAISA Team Race. At the end of the weekend, the Crimson added a second and sixth place finish to its records.
This marked the second consecutive weekend that the Crimson has placed second in one of the regattas. These second place finishes mark the highest placement of a Harvard team this spring season.
FRIIS TROPHY
The Friis Trophy event was originally meant to be hosted at Harvard, but it had to be relocated due to weather. Instead, sailors traveled to Roger Williams, where they raced in FJs and 420s.
The teams also saw difficult weather throughout the whole weekend. Saturday brought wind, rain, and snow, with temperatures dropping into the 20s.
“We had to adjust to different weather conditions throughout the weekend, including heavy wind on Saturday and light wind with choppy water on Sunday,” freshman crew Kevin Coakley said. “We relied on experience and adjusted with the conditions.”
And this experience certainly seemed to show, as the No. 9 Crimson finished the weekend with a 9-5 record, coming in second only to No. 1 Yale.
The pool of competitors only contained ranked teams, including No. 3 Boston College and No. 10 Stanford. In addition, Harvard swept three races, with its boats finishing 1-2-3 against St. Mary’s, No. 5 Tufts, and No. 6 Dartmouth.
Three skipper-crew pairs competed in a majority of the regatta’s races. Senior skipper Brian Drumm paired with junior crew Jacob Brandt, senior skipped Michael Drumm raced with Coakley, and senior skipper Gram Slattery competed alongside sophomore crew Julia Lord.
With weather changes, the pairs were shuffled around, and the duo of juniors Marek Zaleski and Sydney Karnovsky saw some action on the water.
Many of the same Harvard sailors had also competed the weekend before, traveling for two weekends straight. The team is currently priming a contingent to compete in the New England Championships in two weeks, and these regattas are the perfect opportunity to prepare.
“[The many regattas are] a large time commitment, but we all want to perform well at the New England Championships, so everyone makes sailing a priority,” Coakley said. “We get our work done during the week and ensure that we are prepared for all-day regattas on the weekend.”
NEISA-MAISA
Another group of Crimson sailors made the trek to Boston College, where they finished sixth. The race hosted teams from the North East and Middle Atlantic conferences. They sailed in 420s in team style racing.
“We actually sailed better than the results would suggest,” skipper Dylan Farrell said. “We were very close to winning at least four races. We were in a winning combination in the later stages of the race but couldn't execute well enough to maintain the lead and get the win.”
Harvard again saw fierce competition and fiercer weather at the regatta, sailing against ranked teams BC, No. 7 Fordham, and No. 8 Roger Williams.
Conditions did not prove helpful either. Saturday saw heavy gusts and snow. The races were called short due to 20-knot winds and low visibility. Sunday brought its own challenges as well: light, inconsistent wind.
“The regatta was a good opportunity to work on heavy-air boat handling the first day and light-air boat handling the second day,” Farrell said. “We also got a lot of experience applying team racing principles in challenging conditions.”
At this regatta, the same duos competed in every race. Freshman skipper Nick Sertl raced with sophomore crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj. Farrell was joined by sophomore crew Olivia Kjorlien, and the duo of freshman skipper Taylor Ladd and junior crew Kristina Jakobson competed as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, Harvard sailing competed in two regattas, the Navy Women Spring Regatta and the St. Mary’s Team Race. The Crimson took home 18th at Navy and 7th at St. Mary’s.
ST. MARY’S TEAM RACE
No. 9 Harvard’s coed squad opened its spring season in Maryland, finishing the weekend with a 3-6 record, good enough to place seventh of 10 teams. With a tough Massachusetts winter behind it, the team was ready to kick-start its season in warmer climates.
“We went into this weekend with the mindset of jump starting our spring season and getting team racing experience against top-level competition,” freshman crew Kevin Coakley said.
And the Crimson certainly did face top-level competition. The top-four finishers were No. 1 Yale, No. 3 Boston College, No. 4 College of Charleston, and No. 2 Georgetown, in that order. In fact, every team entered in the regatta was ranked coming into the season.
The weather provided another challenge. While Saturday’s conditions were manageable—three-seven knot winds and fog—Sunday brought high winds causing races to be altered and adjustments to be made.
During the second round-robin rotation, the winds became too much and the race had to be put on hold. In addition, FJ’s were eliminated, and the races continued in 420’s only. The Crimson also changed its skipper/crew pairings a bit. The tough weather conditions gave the team a nod to what it needs to improve on.
“The wind conditions on Sunday exposed that we need more practice with heavy air team racing and boat handling,” Coakley said.
The Crimson brought three skippers and four crew to the regatta. Most of the races saw the following pairings: senior skipper Brian Drumm and junior crew Jacob Brandt, senior skipper Michael Drumm and Coakley, and junior skipper Andrew Mollerus and junior crew Syndey Karnovsky. Sophomore crew Julia Lord stepped in for Coakley in the race against SUNY Maritime.
Another facet that added difficulty to this opening regatta was the lack of practice Harvard had been able to do leading up to this weekend.
“Our greatest difficulty was competing given our limited practice time this spring,” Coakley said. “Some teams from further south have been practicing for several weeks now and others were coming off spring break training trips, which showed in their racing.”
And now, with this tune-up under its belt, the Crimson is ready to take on its spring season.
NAVY WOMEN’S SPRING REGATTA
The women’s squad traveled to another Maryland college to take 18th in a pool of 20 teams. At this regatta, the competitors took part in fleet style racing—as opposed to the team style carried out at St. Mary’s.
The unranked Crimson again found itself amongst difficult opponents, including No. 1 Yale and No. 4 Navy. At the end of the weekend, its combined score of 126 put Harvard ahead of Hobart and William Smith and Columbia.
“We didn’t do as well as we hoped,” freshman Taylor Ladd said. “But this regatta for us was more about time on the water than anything else.”
In the A division, junior Sophie Bermudez and senior Ashleigh Inglis finished at 16th with 68 points, ahead of No. 3 Georgetown and No. 7 Coast Guard. The B division pair of Ladd and junior Kristina Jakobson took 16th place as well.
This regatta also saw weather difficulties. On Saturday, the races were postponed for lack of wind, and they commenced in the afternoon when the wind picked up to a meager four knots. Sunday, on the other hand, saw gusts into the upper 20s which did not cease for the rest of the day. The races were called at 12:30p.m., leaving another day of frustrating conditions.
“It was a good learning experience,” Ladd said. “And it got us back on the water.”

It's #sb2k15, and while some people are living it up to make their spring breaks one for the memories, others are basking in the glory of those people's vacations through social media. Here are the different types of FOMO's (fear of missing out) you might be experiencing if you're a part of the latter half spending your time away scrolling through Instagram:
The Vitamin D FOMOWe're all flooded with Facebook photos of our friends soaking up the sun in swimsuits, surrounded by other inebriated college students in Cabo, PV, or anywhere else where it's #sunsoutgunsout. They also keep taking pictures with sand, palm trees, and beaches, while the closest you came to that was at #HarvardOasis.
The Traveling FOMOSome of your friends are traveling the world right now, traversing through the depths of different continents while you're traversing through the depths of your fridge and Netflix. What's even worse is when many of these friends are going on these trips for little to no cost thanks to student organizations they're involved in, making you curse your lack of extracurricular foresight.
The Resume-Building FOMOWhile some are off vacationing, other friends are filling you in on all of the interviews they have scheduled for this week for prospective summer internships. Meanwhile, you're still waiting with fingers crossed for that #blessed email that someone somewhere has faith in your professional skills and wants you in for an interview.
The Friendship FOMOTo be honest, you're happy to be home in your own bed, with home-made food, and away from the Harvard bubble for a week. Buuuut, when your friend group is off doing some sort of group activity over spring break that you decided not to partake in, you can't help but feel a little jealous of all the bonding, inside jokes, and throwbacks to the trip people will have upon coming back to school. And the worst offense of all– when all your friends cover photo a group picture from something you weren't a part of. Ugh.
