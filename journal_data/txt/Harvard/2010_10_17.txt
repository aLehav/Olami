After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though most college graduates meet up every five or 10 years to reminisce with old friends, three Harvard hockey stars from the class of 1973 have earned a different sort of reunion.
On Nov. 10 at 6 p.m., right wing Bill Corkery, center Bob McManama, and left wing Dave Hynes will meet up once again as the three are inducted into the Massachusetts Hockey Hall of Fame.
Affectionately known as the “Local Line” because of their Massachusetts roots, the dynamic trio led the Crimson for three years to kick off the ’70s, combining for 201 goals and 407 points. In 1971, the then-sophomores helped Harvard win the ECAC championship and earn a place in the NCAA semifinal game. The Crimson also claimed a share of the ECAC title in 1973.
All three Harvard hockey players garnered All-Ivy League honors during their illustrious careers, and Hynes and McManama earned All-America status in their senior year.
Natives of Massachusetts that perform at the highest level on the ice and exhibit good sportsmanship and other positive personal qualities can be inducted to the MA Hockey Hall of Fame in one or more of the following categories: players, officials, media, builders, and coaches.
The 16th induction ceremony for the Hall of Fame will feature the three Harvard standouts and eight other local greats. Check this out for more info.

In  this series, we chat with the freshmen who were lucky enough to  land dorm rooms that once housed Harvard’s most famous almuni.
 
Today,  we’re looking at the Holworthy dorm room that was once occupied by Conan O’Brien '85  and currently is the home to Alice X. Wang '14, Camille Z. Coppola '14,  Rainjade A. Chung '14, and Barr Yaron '14.  The three-room suite is a  gorgeous space with wooden floors, high ceilings, and a non-functional  brick fireplace that warms the décor.
 
 
The  roommates told us that when they discovered they were living in  O’Brien’s old room, they were extremely excited. “I think we all posted  it as our Facebook statuses right away,” Wang said.
 
 
Here are some excerpts from our conversation:
 When you discovered that you were living in Conan O’Brien’s room for the first time, did you:
a. Grimace and wonder to yourself why humor exists in this world
b. Tell your roommates that you never watch his show because it’s on too late
c. Laugh and consider inviting him to dinner as he is currently unemployed
 
Chung: What? These are all really weird.
On  Sept. 24, 2010, Conan O’Brien tweeted the following: “We shouldn’t name  hurricanes. It only encourages them.” What is your favorite hurricane  and why?
Wang: That is totally a sensitive subject. I mean, come on, I’m from Houston!
Coppola: Okay, but I’m pretty sure there was a hurricane Camille that destroyed like half of the United States…
 
On a scale of 1-10, how jealous are your suitemates?
[Shouted from the adjacent connecting suite.]
 
Marissa C. Friedman '14: I’m kind of jealous but then I feel better because I get to shower in his shower too. 
Conan O’Brien lived in Mather House after his freshman year. What house are you hoping to get into? 
Wang: Well, I don’t want to offend our future house or anything.
Coppola: Mather has happy hours, and singles, and good house spirit… so, maybe?
Yaron: But of course, whatever house we end up in will be the best house.
Chung: And he [O’Brien] can still come back and have tea with us! And coconuts!

CORRECTIONS: October 19, 2010
An earlier version of the  graphic accompanying the Oct. 17 FlyBy post "Final Club Real Estate"  switched the locations of the Fly and the Spee.
The graphic also stated that the Spee owned owns the Bee and J.Press. In fact, the Fly owns them.

All right, so the idea of getting the flu shot in a dining hall might make you queasy. But it's better than getting the flu in a dining hall (hope everyone's using that hand sanitizer). Plus, be glad that Harvard's on top of its flu shot game—at Yale, the first student vaccination clinic isn't happening until Oct. 25. At Harvard, the student-only clinics began on Oct. 6 (and university-wide clinics started last month).
Flu shots are free to all students with a Harvard ID. If you want to get yourself vaccinated, here's the schedule for the rest of October:
Oct. 20, 5–8pm, Eliot Dining Hall 
Oct. 21, 5–8pm, Currier Dining Hall
Oct. 27, 5–8pm, Leverett Dining Hall
Can't make it to any of those clinics? Check the UHS website for other times and locations on campus.
