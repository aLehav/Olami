When “Rent” debuted in 1996, the rock opera grabbed the national imagination and hung on with vengeance. It won a Tony. It won a Pulitzer. In a crushing case study on irony, its creator passed away the night before the show opened. The New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley wrote that the show’s “spirited score and lyrics” defied death. And today — 20 years after “Rent” began its first national tour — the show’s anniversary revival tests whether “Rent” itself can defy death, too.
At the Boch Center’s Shubert Theater, where the musical will play through Nov. 10, “Rent” begins its latest bid for relevance on a stage strewn with debris. Milk cartons sit at exacting angles. The cast wear skinny jeans and beanies. The show’s protagonist steps out on stage amid candles glowing from a prop fire escape. And then, against its backdrop of forced nonchalance, “Rent” retells the story it’s been championing for 20 years: one of self-identified bohemians who, via the power of friendship, fight rising living costs, AIDS, and the Man.
The resulting musical is by turns silly, incoherent, tragic, radical, and insensitive. It still stars a cast that looks like a real New York City street might; it also uses “queer” only as a slur and features an entire song about consumerism in the 1990s. “Rent” has aged in complicated ways since its debut. If the current iteration captures anything of the original, however, it is the original’s offbeat optimism.
The credit for the show’s buoyancy belongs largely to the cast, most of whom are making their national debuts with “Rent” and all of whom embrace their roles with easy energy. Maureen Johnson (Kelsee Sweigard) and Joanne Jefferson (Samantha Mbolekwa), partners whose mercurial relationship co-opts the plot, stand out among a deep cast: Sweigard is as charismatic, and Mbolekwa as measured, as each needs to be. Their big-hearted warmth makes “Take Me Or Leave Me,” a sonic power struggle between two outsized personalities, the auditory highlight of the show.
Roger Davis (Coleman Cummings) and Mimi Marquez (Aiyana Smash), HIV-positive recovering addicts in an on-again-off-again relationship, glow more gently. Smash sings in a raspy alto, while Cummings’s voice is almost choral — an effect that softens his character’s toughness while equally eroding the grit typical of ‘90s rock. Both singers excel in the second half of the performance, where characters die aching deaths and songwriter Jonathan Larson makes more overt “Rent”’s meditation on time and running out of it. (“Forget regret or life is yours to miss,” he writes in the second part of the finale.)
The show’s second half also soars for its ability to highlight the supporting cast, who stand out at every opportunity. Several of the supporting cast members are dancers in a way that the show’s leads are not, and their athleticism further energizes the whole production. The cast’s depth also grants empathy to the homeless characters the supporting members often play, humanizing the non-bohemian, systemic poverty that “Rent” has been accused of erasing.
In “Seasons of Love,” the musical’s blockbuster number, the chorus provides a metric for evaluating a lifetime. There are 525,600 minutes in a year, the lyrics go, which can be alternately measured in sunsets, midnights, or cups of coffee. By the song’s metric, it has been roughly 2,102,400 minutes since gay marriage became legalized; 17,870,400 minutes since the AIDS epidemic reached its peak; 10,512,000 minutes since “Rent” debuted. But the show itself isn’t counting. Instead, the modern “Rent”’s depth defends the musical's premise: that situations are temporary, but spirit lasts forever. It is possible to imagine a future world without HIV, rent inflation, or rock operas. With a production as upbeat and generous as the anniversary revival’s, however, it is harder to imagine a world where “Rent”’s 165 minutes are not worth a watch.

In the vein of TNT’s “Will” and The CW’s “Reign,” Apple TV+’s new series “Dickinson” attempts to portray the life of a famous historical figure in a fresh and modern way. This “modern” take, however, feels a little less “new” and a little more mismatched. The show is also meant to be shocking, but it falls flat because of this more experimental take. This is not to say that “Dickinson” is unentertaining, but it feels uneven as the blend of contemporary elements with the historical narrative is unbalanced.
“Dickinson” focuses on the poet Emily Dickinson’s life in the 1850s: A frustrated, 20-something-year-old Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) spends her days doing house chores and being paraded by her mother Mrs. Dickinson (Jane Krakowski) before potential suitors in her large ancestral home in Amherst, Mass. Her nights are spent frantically writing and delving into extraordinary fantasies. Emily does not wish to get married, because she believes it will prevent her from becoming a great writer. Her father Edward (Toby Huss) actively discourages her career, believing it will bring shame to their good family name.
Emily simultaneously struggles with curbing the affections of her brother’s best friend, George Gould (Samuel Farnsworth), a local literary magazine editor who wants to marry her, and balancing her own romantic feelings for her best friend, Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt), who gets engaged to Austin (Adrian Blake Enscoe) for financial security in spite of her feelings for Emily.
The pilot clearly lays out the conflicts that the rest of the series will address, namely Emily’s desire to write against her father’s wishes and a love triangle between Austin, Sue, and Emily, as well as Edward’s decision to run for Congress. Looming behind all these plotlines is the shadow of the Civil War, which is frequently foreshadowed by various characters.
Though the setting and costumes are period-appropriate, the show’s dialogue and music is contemporary. The choice to make the characters speak colloquially is original, but ultimately strange. While riding by on horseback, Austin greets his sister with a quick “What up, sis?” To which she breezily replies, “Nothin’, bro. Just chillin’.” All the while, A$AP Rocky’s "Praise the Lord (Da Shine)" plays in the background. The whole exchange tries too hard to feel natural and cool. It’s incorporation of contemporary rap music perhaps a poor attempt to borrow from HBO’s more stylistic “Euphoria,” which was praised by critics for its use of soundtrack. “Dickinson” can’t replicate the same sleek vision as “Euphoria” because it isn’t aware of what it wants to be exactly: A fresh, hip feminist critique or sophisticated historical period drama?
Portraying the life of Emily Dickinson means taking a lot of creative liberties, because not all that much is known about the poet whose work was only discovered posthumously. Still, it is hard to imagine the notoriously secluded Dickinson ever going into an orchard to violently embrace her best friend after she gets engaged to Emily’s brother Austin. Paradoxically, when Steinfeld speaks like a modern girl about her problems, it becomes easy to forget that she is Emily Dickinson and just how transgressive her romantic relationship would have been to those in Dickinson’s circles. Though she plays the role with spunk and humor, Steinfeld is so rebellious and stubborn that she appears a little bit more like her character in “The Edge of Seventeen” than the genius poet. She does, however, capture her eccentricity both hilariously and sensitively.
Overall, the show’s humor feels mismatched to the tone of the period. There is a strange moment, for example, when Austin tell Emily that Sue’s sister Mary died and Emily deadpans, “What? She was the healthy one!” Other moments are much more successful. All the comments about her various suitors from Emily to her mother are quite funny, as is the instant when Austin announces to his sister that Sue has accepted his proposal: A flashback unexpectedly reveals that Sue only agrees to his proposal after Austin goes down on her.
The first episode takes place on the day that Emily writes her famous poem, “Because I could not stop for death (479),” which means that the episode also focuses on her writing process of this work. The inspiration of this poem, according to the TV show that is, is a recurring dream of Death, surprisingly played by rapper Wiz Khalifa, who arrives in a black carriage. In a rather CW-esque scene, Emily emerges out of her home wearing a gorgeous, red satin gown to meet him — with Billie Eilish’s “bury a friend” ominously playing in the background, of course.
Though bizarre and comic, Emily’s exchange with Death is one of the best parts of the episode, because it allows the audience to finally see the more pensive and cerebral side of her, the side that readers of her work have come to know: her preoccupation with fame, death, and immortality. The moment contrasts rather starkly with her actual writing of the poem. When she finally champions her writer’s block and comes up with the second line of the poem, she confidently whispers, “Nailed it!”
Overall, “Dickinson” should be commended for its bold artistic choices, namely its blend of the modern and historical, but its failure to make these fuse together is ultimately unsurprising. While its experimentation might be an homage to Dickinson’s work, the show fails to be as revolutionary as its subject.

Keeping up with the times, this week’s episode of “Riverdale” is aptly called “Halloween” and leans into the spookiness of the season. There are some moments throughout the episode that are truly chilling, but they’re often followed by explanations that undermine the scenes in question, whether that’s due to the strange reactions of other characters or the unsatisfying reasons for the event happening at all.
For instance, Jughead (Cole Sprouse) is locked in a coffin overnight after being drugged by a fellow student. His heavy breathing, constant shouting, and loud banging on the coffin’s lid to no avail are certainly scary. Sprouse vividly depicts the terror of waking up to find oneself in a closed — and locked — space. Less satisfying, however, is learning that this ordeal is all some sort of initiation process. His teacher finds him, but only seems mildly concerned to find a student nailed into a coffin. In his office, no less!
Veronica (Camila Mendes) has a classic Halloween night, and it’s one of the best parts of the episode. She’s closing up Pop’s alone when a trucker walks in asking for some food. He’s been on the road, he says, and wants to make it to his family before daybreak. All he needs is a home-cooked meal… so he came to a restaurant, instead of finishing his drive to his actual home? Anyway, he shows a picture of his family to V, and she smiles and offers him a piece of pie when she hears on the TV a warning about an escaped serial killer called “The Family Man,” known for forcing his victims to make him meals before killing them. Of course, it’s hard to believe spoiled Veronica actually cooked his food, but that’s neither here nor there. She runs into the speakeasy downstairs — not out the front door, to safety — and sets up a trap that is contingent on the fact that The Family Man has a lighter. And what do you know? He does! So she throws some sort of alcohol on him, sending him up in flames. It’s pretty “badass,” to quote Archie, when they’re in bed later. But really, that’s all he can muster? His girlfriend just lit a serial killer on fire, and she gets a nice pat on the back.
Archie’s (KJ Apa) story is setting out to be the dullest of the season. He’s set on making the community a better place both by beating up Dodger (Juan Riedinger) — presumably the head of a gang, but much scarier than the Pretty Poisons or the Southside Serpents — and hosting Halloween parties for kids. Veronica mentions her friend Katy Keene (an on-the-nose plug for the upcoming CW spinoff of the same name) from NYC who will somehow magically design and create costumes for Archie and Monroe (Eli Goree) for the party. Archie is Pureheart the Powerful while Monroe is stuck with being The Shield. Essentially, when FP (Skeet Ulrich) arrives too late to the community center, a kid gets shot in the leg by Dodger. Of course, Archie seems intrigued by the idea of using his new superhero costume to enact vigilante justice. Viewers can only hope this was a joke and not the next step in Archie’s life.
The teaser from last week’s episode was a mysterious tape, which turns out to be much less creepy or important than expected. It’s literally just six hours of footage of Betty’s (Lili Reinhart) house, taken from across the street. Other people in Riverdale start getting these tapes, which is sort of weird but also a disappointment amongst all the other Halloween happenings in Riverdale.
Betty comes a close second to Veronica for most traumatic night. At school, she keeps running into students dressed as the Black Hood (her father) and the Gargoyle King. Why parents are letting their children dress as the town serial killers — of the last two years, no less — is beyond me. Then she keeps getting calls from someone pretending to be the Black Hood. After Jellybean (Trinity Likins) plays a joke on Betty — in very poor taste — by pretending to be attacked upstairs, Charles (Wyatt Nash) shows up. He offers to track the calls, blames the calls on Polly (Tiera Skovbye), then offers Betty a spot in the junior FBI program, which apparently she doesn’t need to sign up for.
Perhaps most unbelievable is Cheryl’s (Madeline Petsch) plotline, which has truly just run off the rails. Toni (Vanessa Morgan) puts her foot down and makes Cheryl bury her long-dead brother’s corpse, but a creepy doll starts haunting them. “I know you’re mad that I made you bury your dead brother’s corpse, but…” is literally something that comes out of Toni’s mouth. There’s a seance and Nana Rose (Barbara Wallace) lets it slip that Cheryl was actually originally a triplet and not a twin, but Cheryl “ate her brother in the womb.” Cheryl’s mother raised the doll, named Julian, alongside her living children, and now we’re meant to believe Julian is haunting Thistlehouse. I’m begging the writers: Please just leave the Blossoms alone.
Unfortunately, “Riverdale” decides to mention domestic abuse again and handles it poorly. Reggie (Charles Melton) convinces Kevin (Casey Cott) to destroy Principal Honey’s (Kerr Smith) office. When they’re caught, Mr. Honey tells Kevin he’ll never get into NYU, which makes Kevin snitch. Then, Mr. Honey confronts Reggie and asks if his behavior is related to Reggie’s father’s abuse. Mind you, he doesn’t ask how he can help Reggie, but instead accuses Reggie of trying to mask his bruises and black eyes with jokes. Then Reggie walks outside to find his car has been completely wrecked. Who let Mr. Honey work with children?
And, in its boldest move yet, “Riverdale” gives viewers a taste of what’s to come. When Betty and Jughead are on the phone (with Charles, who is the child of Betty’s mom and Jughead’s dad, tapping the wire) Jughead tells Betty, “I think deep down I know that if I really ever went missing you would be the first one to find me.”
“I would, Jug. I promise,” she says, and then it flashes forward to a coroner’s office, where Betty and FP cry as a sheet is lifted to reveal… Jughead. Are they really going to kill off our favorite weirdo and leave us watching Archie running around in his new supersuit? I really hope not, but only time will tell.

A teenager, disillusioned and dissatisfied with his life at a public high school in southern Florida, decides to spend the rest of his high school career at a boarding school in Alabama. Obsessed with the last words of famous people, he is particularly inspired by those of François Rabelais: “I go to seek a Great Perhaps.” He hopes, it seems, to find adventure and bring meaning to his life. This is the story of Miles Halter (Charlie Plummer), the skinny and starry-eyed protagonist of Hulu’s new eight-episode miniseries, “Looking for Alaska.” This could, however, also be the story of John Green, YouTuber extraordinaire, author of the book from which the miniseries was adapted, and leader of the “Nerdfighters,” which informs the main theme of the show.
Much like the film adaptations of Green’s other books (“The Fault in Our Stars” and “Paper Towns”), “Looking for Alaska” remains fairly faithful to the source material — more “Harry Potter” than “Avatar: The Last Airbender.” The series follows Miles as he adjusts to life at Culver Creek Academy. Along the way, he meets Chip “the Colonel” Martin (Denny Love), Takumi (Jay Lee), and the titular Alaska Young (Kristine Froseth) — the pretty girl-next-door whose room is decorated with string lights and shelves of books she’s never read and who angstily proclaims things like, “Life’s about disappointing those who are in charge of us.” It takes about 10 seconds for Miles to fall in love with her. The gang spends their days drinking cheap alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and playing pranks on the “Weekday Warriors,” a group of “rich assholes who leave every weekend for their air-conditioned Birmingham mansions,” and for whom hair care and playing lacrosse are defining personality traits.
The show manages to cram a lot into eight episodes. It’s a sort of bildungsroman: Miles receives (and, in a particularly funny scene, learns how to give) his first blowjob, takes a transformative world religions class found only in fictional high schools, and does eventually find the “Great Perhaps” he seeks. It deals, quite seriously, with grief: A major death about three-quarters of the way through the show rattles the school, and the aftermath manages to balance the serious impact with high school TV show levity in a way that not many teen dramas pull off successfully. There are hints of a commentary on income inequality and privilege. “This place doesn’t just belong to the Longwells and Kevins. This is Chip’s school too,” Alaska proclaims in defense of Chip, whose reliance on the school as the only way out of poverty is made fun of by the Weekday Warriors (whose admission to Duke is made possible by their parents’ money and connections).
What the show is really about, however, is the same thing that “Freaks and Geeks,” “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” as well as the entirety of the John Green canon are all about — nerds. There’s a sort of war that persists through the show, in a more literal sense than in most teen dramas, between the gang of nerds — outsiders, rebels, whatever you want to call them — and the Weekday Warriors (read: preppy jocks). Miles gets kidnapped and thrown into a lake. Kevin and Longwell get laxatives mixed into their protein shakes (which makes for a particularly messy, but hilarious, bathroom scene). Miles, at one point, declares, “I could have been a part of this Weekend Warrior life. I said no,” with a heroic defiance more befitting of George Washington or Han Solo than a high school junior. At Culver Creek Academy, the culture war becomes an actual, physical war — a metaphor with John Green’s name written all over it.
The show sounds like how John Green writes — that is, with a sort of faux-intellectualism that is usually not how people talk, especially not 16-years-olds. “Extricate this claw from my boob,” Alaska says after receiving a self-described “much-too-firm two-to-three second honk,” a scripted exchange that probably seemed very witty on paper, but, like much of the dialogue in the show, comes off as exactly that — scripted (and, frankly, often annoying). There’s also a shallowness to the whole more-intellectual-than-thou mentality that oozes from the protagonists. A high school junior can only be so worldly before it becomes unconvincing. “You have ten seconds to say something interesting before I write you off as ordinary,” Chip says upon meeting Miles: One has to wonder how much shorter the show would have been if Chip hadn’t found famous last words interesting enough for his elite intellectual standards.
That being said, it’s still a fun show. You don’t watch a teen drama for an accurate depiction of the mundane life of an average high schooler; you watch it to see the underdogs win, to see the nerds pool their cunning and resourcefulness to prank the shit out of the jocks (literally), to see high school how it feels in the moment, not how it actually is. When the gang dances to indie soft pop in their smoking hideout, when they develop intricate contingency plans for the next prank, when they sit in a barn drinking Strawberry Hill wine and playing best day/worst day, you could be cynical. You could question why they care so much about pranks and whether or not they’ve had enough days to really have a best or worst one and whether or not they over-glorify smoking (there might be a point to this last one, actually), or you could just take it for what it is — high schoolers being high schoolers. “Looking for Alaska,” makes it easy to suspend your disbelief and see yourself in the minds of these 16-year-olds, and for that, it will make John Green — and his army of Nerdfighters, myself included — quite proud.

Breaking news: Charli XCX has made landfall. When last we heard from the British boombox pop star, she was jet-skiing around some shallows with Troye Sivan in the appropriately one-note music video for “2099,” an extremely (though not quite literally) one-note song. While it’s great to see her safely ashore in her new video “White Mercedes” it would be even greater to see the change of scenery bring some new ideas.
Instead, it’s déjà vu all over again. If it weren’t well-documented that “White Mercedes” was directed by Colin Solal Cardo and its predecessor by Bradley&Pablo, the two short films could feel like consecutive fever dreams. Both feature excess pastel tulle billowing behind Charli in the breeze. Both feature sultry choreography set atop moving white vehicles sending either dust or spray into massive clouds. Even the admittedly beautiful orbs, which appear in the sky during the new video’s final chorus, mimic the bokeh which begins to pop up near the end of “2099.” At least this time around we’re not supposed to believe Troye is doing flips in the background.
But don’t worry, “White Mercedes” is still Exciting ™. Charli has to sing from a car hanging hood-down, and then the car gets literally run over by a white monster truck, and then the car (somehow suspended once more) catches fire. I mean, we knew there was going to be a white car in the video — who would pass up a chance to use a title literally? — but no one could have predicted what it would do once it got there, nor could anyone have predicted it would be joined by a white horse recently escaped from “Bound 2” by Kanye West.
In a particularly generous reading, the gratuitous “action movie” vibes (as per Rolling Stone) could function as a materialistic cover-up for a complex emotional landscape. “You know I’ve got a suit of armor on,” Charli sings. Maybe the armor is the gown and the fire and the expensive watch and the not-so-subtle Powerbeats Pro product placement. Perhaps the close-up, the handheld shots, and the fireworks reflecting in her stoic eyes reveal her inner turmoil even as her exterior seems cool, calm, and collected. After all, the singer of “White Mercedes” is meant to be an icy expert at avoidance, and if that voice is meant to define the whole of her new album, “Charli,” it would make sense for imagery to repeat from “2099” to its video.
But I’d guess the symbolism was an afterthought to the commercialism, that the problems Charli XCX is blocking out in “White Mercedes” include the seemingly pointless inconsistencies in the video. One particularly obvious example: She sings, “You’re chasing after something that you’ll never catch,” but it looks like the car she’s riding is actually moving pretty slowly. I still probably couldn’t catch it, but I also haven’t been to the gym in three years. More generally, it’s impossible to write off the aesthetic contradictions between the song, a sweeping tech pop ballad with breathily-voiced references to addiction, and the video, an ode to luxury which could neatly double as a perfume ad. The contrast isn’t strong enough to imply an intentional juxtaposition: It just seems like a mistake. Maybe we could shrug and appreciate the glamour in isolation if the family resemblance to “2099” were less pronounced, but as stands, my confusion has an aftertaste of boredom.
The music itself is cool, fresh, inventive. Pitchfork gave “Charli” a 7.8, and if you can’t trust Pitchfork, you can’t trust anyone. I just wish the videos looked the ways the songs sounded. Instead, “White Mercedes” looks like it was designed to produce a compelling thumbnail.

Are there any good October songs? Are there *any* October songs? Other months have an embarrassing number of seasonal songs. September has Earth, Wind, and Fire and Taylor Swift’s cover. November has Guns N’ Roses’ “November Rain” and The National’s “Mr. November.” A cursory Spotify search, though, yields next to nothing for October. Why no love for the tenth month?
It may be that nobody cares about October. Google Trends shows October’s lack of popularity compared to May, a month few would call their favorite. October has a public image problem, something the current music scene fails to solve adequately. Let’s examine five October songs, ranked by success in giving October a proper banger.
5. “October” - Broken Bells
Sounds good, doesn’t work. Beautiful instrumentals and evocative lyrics aside, the song has no October-specific impact. The closest this indie duo comes to naming the month is with the line “I come by the light of an autumn moon.” Is there anything about October that makes moons brighter? If not, what are we doing here?
4. “October Skies” - Mumford and Sons
There are two types of Mumford and Sons songs. Some are loud and anthemic. Others are quiet and moody. Unfortunately, “October Skies” belongs in the latter. Playing this song at a party would barely register given how quiet and introspective it is. There’s obviously a trend of indie songwriters having sensitive eyesight in the autumn, as Marcus Mumford cries that “I’m blinded by the lights / Of October Skies.” Unfortunately, physical ailments are not what October is going for here.
3. “October” - U2
Bono likens the month to a forest of nude saplings: “October and the trees are stripped bare / Of all they wear.” The image is haunting, confusing, and immediately dispelled when Bono asks, “What do I care?”, dropping the subject and quickly moving on. We heard you, Bono, and all the beautiful piano-playing in the world won’t save you from that embarrassing metaphor.
2. “Ghostbusters” - Ray Parker, Jr.
The first song on this list to not explicitly mention October is also more October-y than any of the others. Confident, cool, and commanding, Ray Parker, Jr. crafts an October song for the ages. The song’s memorable hook — “Who you gonna call? / Ghostbusters!” — makes it clear October would benefit from dropping the whole month thing and going all-in on Halloween. The anti-ghost message may look terribly passé in a few decades, but “Ghostbusters” is a tough challenger to beat.
1. “Wake Me Up When September Ends” - Green Day
Let’s be clear: At its core, “Wake Me Up When September Ends” is an October song. It succeeds in its October-osity by denouncing the month’s worst rival: September. By constantly railing on the ninth month’s precipitation tendencies — “Here comes the rain again” — Billie Joe Armstrong implicitly endorses October, the month in which he can finally awaken. Indeed, October’s true banger is the result of dunking on its competition.

Before BTS rocketed to international fame and transformed into a hit generator, cranking out one synth-heavy track after another with Billboard Hot 100’s flavor of the week as a featured artist (see “Boy with Luv” feat. Halsey, “Dream Glow” feat. Charli XCX, “A Brand New Day” feat. Zara Larsson, “Make it Right” feat. Lauv), they enjoyed a truly golden era. BTS’ sophomore studio album, “Wings,” is particularly noteworthy for its simultaneously ethereal and haunting soundscape as well as its iconic title song, “Blood Sweat & Tears.” Released Oct. 10, 2016 and directed by YongSeok Choi and Edie YooJeong Ko, the music video for “Blood Sweat & Tears” is a visual cacophony of whimsical grandeur, filled with shots of spacious rooms bedecked with glittering chandeliers and Renaissance paintings. Shockingly enough, BTS manages not to skimp on the complex, energetic choreography that they’re so beloved for while still fitting a storyline laced with religious imagery into six minutes’ worth of video. At first glance, the music video seems thematically incongruous with the lyrics, which speak of a desire to give in to the temptation of a potentially toxic love. Upon a second viewing, however, the visual elements seem to twist and redirect the longing sentiments of the lyrics towards general sin rather than a romantic partner, transforming BTS’ colorful music video into a surprisingly serious rumination on human nature.
The video starts with the members of BTS – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, Jungkook – frolicking in what looks like a museum exhibit or the lobby of a glamorous manor. Even surrounded by gleaming marble pillars and artfully posed statues, the boys don’t look the slightest bit out of place in their trappings of velvet brocade topped with sequin embellishments. No doubt, the set and costumes reeking of material excess are a gesture towards the level of desperation tingeing the song, in that if all this luxury still cannot satisfy BTS, they must be craving something that necessitates the sacrifice of possessions much more intimate and precious than money. From their “blood, sweat, and tears” to their “body, mind, and soul,” BTS seems to invite either their lover or a higher power to “take them all away.”
By the time the first breathy verse falls away into an addictive, synth-heavy breakdown, BTS is already arranged in perfect formation, standing like a tableau at the center of the tiled floor. In sync with the beat drop, all the members simultaneously tip their heads back to the ceiling and flutter the fingers of one hand over their eyes as a makeshift blindfold. Given the plentiful religious imagery littered throughout the music video — like “The Fall of the Rebel Angels” by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, depicting angels driving their fallen brethren from Heaven; “Pietà” by Michelangelo, a sculpture of the crucified body of Jesus Christ laying across Mary’s lap; or the shot of BTS standing around a long dinner table laden with silverware, mimicking da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” – this choreography signals the intrinsic ignorance of humanity and their willful defiance of God.
In the second repetition of the chorus, a few more dance moves are revealed: Hip thrusts paired with Michael Jackson-esque crotch grabs and body rolls against the pristine floors are executed with more lower body movement than strictly necessary. Clearly, these motions cannot possibly be just an appeal to the raging hormones of thirsty teens, but rather another cue towards the greater moral about mankind’s corruption and their urge to sin.
Immediately after the third chorus finishes on a sharp, crying note, all music suddenly cuts away for a cinematic interlude. In a high-contrast shot colored only in black and red, a dark silhouette stands, slowly letting go of the string of a balloon. A narration by RM plays over the shot, his voice slowly enunciating the words of a quote taken from Hermann Hesse’s novel, “Demian,” that references a spiritual struggle between the evil world of illusion and the good world of internal truth: “He too, was a tempter; he, too, was a link to the second, the evil world with which I no longer wanted to have anything to do.” Amidst the eerie organ music that suddenly starts playing, Jin approaches a huge, humanoid statue with a pair of black wings sprouting from its back that resembles Lucifer. The fact that Lucifer seems to be the centerpiece of a museum exhibit signifies how humans unwittingly idolize him and place him on a pedestal (both literally and metaphorically), while also noting that humans underestimate his power by perceiving him as merely a figure for their entertainment. The angle of the shot cleverly captures Jin just as his figure blocks the statue so that the dark wings seem to be attached to Jin’s shoulders instead, foreshadowing his fall from grace. Cementing his submission to the temptation of sin is the act of Jin kissing Lucifer’s statue.
All in a rush, “Blood Sweat & Tears” suddenly resumes at full volume. The blaring synths are accompanied by brief, alternating cuts of chaotic imagery — jets of colorful paint bursting from the ground to frame Michelangelo’s “Pietà,” Lucifer’s statue weeping green tears, frantic choreography. Near the end of the video, Jimin rips off his blindfold to reveal green tear tracks staining his face that match the ones marking Lucifer’s statue, and Jin turns to the camera to show off the thin cracks splintering down his face as if he were a broken porcelain doll. The imagery is oddly reminiscent of Oscar Wilde’s “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” Like Dorian, who sold his soul so that his portrait will age, rot, and bear the consequences of all his indulgences while he remains youthfully pristine forever, Jimin and Jin have also struck deals with the devil to conflate reality with artistic likenesses of reality. However, unlike Dorian, BTS are portraying an interdependent relationship between art and the human in that not only does art reflect the emotions of man, but man also imitates art. Perhaps the real moral of BTS’ “Blood Sweat & Tears” is that although people may hope that there’s a way to keep sin from visibly tainting them, the reality is that humans can never dodge the consequences of their actions or hide the evidence of their immorality from others.

The long-awaited sequel to André Aciman’s “Call Me by Your Name,” made world famous by its movie adaptation, is finally here. “Find Me” is a devastatingly honest reflection on the authenticity of love and life. Aciman does not let the unspoken be the centerpiece of the story; instead, his characters are now speaking up instead of waiting for fortune to guide their future. “Find Me” threads together four stories of mature love, each with its own narrator and style that let readers into the minds of two other characters, Oliver and Samuel, who were central to the first novel. Despite not using provoking imagery as much as he did before, Aciman is still able to provide us with a touching and tender narrative surrounding authentic love.
The novel begins with Samuel, Elio’s father, narrating his encounter with Miranda, a woman he meets on his train ride to visit Elio in Rome. Unexpectedly, and rather quickly, a passionate affair follows. The story progresses with such violent speed that readers might find it unsatisfying when compared to the rich undertext that filled the beginning of the romance between Elio and Oliver in the previous novel. What happened to the nights of uncertainty? The nervous waiting for an answer, a sign? Indeed, when compared to “Call Me by Your Name,” the first part of “Find Me” is undeniably awkward. It doesn’t seem to fit with the slow and torturous warm-up that Elio endured, especially when Samuel’s character is not nearly as developed as Elio or Oliver. But this reading is missing something essential of this new novel: This is not a coming-of-age story anymore. Aciman steps onto thin ice by trying to convey the theme of devoted love, not with young men with most of their lives ahead of them, but with adults with their lives behind them. This might explain why the characters in this new novel act so determinately. Samuel expressed what he thinks of love when he delivered his touching monologue to Elio after Oliver’s departure in “Call Me by Your Name,” so why wouldn’t he seize an opportunity for love when presented with one? The expectation that the characters in “Find Me” would act with the same naïve romanticism of the young men in “Call Me by Your Name” is just absurd. As Aciman writes later in the novel, “An older self is more frugal, more cautious, and therefore more reluctant — or more desperate — to rush into things he already fears he might never find again.” The first story also serves as a sort of roadmap to the rest of the novel. During the development of the affair, Miranda’s father discusses a doctoral dissertation he is editing about the misalignment of time and life, reflecting, “Closure, if it exists at all, is either for the afterlife or for those who stay behind. Ultimately, it is the living who’ll close the ledger of my life, not I.”
In the second and third parts of the novel, Aciman separately brings back Elio and Oliver, the beloved characters from “Call Me by Your Name.” In Elio’s story, readers will recognize the cautious and intimate style of the narration as it guides readers through a totally new and unexpected affair in Paris. The story unfolds with comparable emotional strength to the one with Oliver 15 years in the past, but the teenage hesitation is replaced with mature modesty and sincerity. Oliver, on the other side of the Atlantic, narrates an incident that, despite its seeming insignificance, ends up being one of the last drops in the bucket of his time in America. Seeing Oliver as a narrator, readers are finally let into a world which was the subject of so much speculation in “Call Me by Your Name,” allowing them to know him as a full character, instead of the image of a teenage dream. The dialogue and narration of these sections of the novel are not as cryptical as before. Less is left for the readers to guess, but it results in much character development for both of them. Elio comes to live in these pages where his thoughts and passions are not occluded by an innocent façade, while Oliver pours his heart out in a way never seen before. Their true essence floats to the surface after so many years of boiling deep within them.
These two stories are very easily set apart from the first one. Even though they each touch on the same burning emotions, the latter do a better job at portraying them in a believable way. Maybe the plausibility of Elio’s new romance, and his old one for that matter, is that it is between two men in a time previous to ours. The theme of queer romance lends itself to stories of intense infatuation since it usually follows, or happens alongside, repression of the same desire that provokes it. Gay characters have more obstacles between them than their straight counterparts, so their relationship signifies the triumph over all enemies working against them, and the result is unlikely to be a lukewarm attraction. Aciman skillfully focuses not on the nature of their sexuality, but in the content of their desire and pleasure. The gay love story serves as a tool for Aciman to deliver this seemingly unbelievable love between his characters.
The whole book up to this point is a prelude to the centerpiece of Aciman’s novel: The return to the beginning that everyone has been waiting for, the reunion of Elio and Oliver. But this time, it takes place more than two decades after they first met and seven years after their second meeting at the end of “Call Me by Your Name.” Now, with 20 years between them and their coming of age story, the characters are mature enough to face each other. Their second reunion, by contrast, was too early for both of them. Even after years since their swooning adventure in Italy, they had not been able to fully process it. It would take yet almost another decade, and some explanation on Aciman’s side, to allow the story to continue unfolding.
“Find Me” is a truly remarkable achievement of love beyond the honeymoon teenage years. Despite omitting some of the poetry in his previous novel, the book conveys the same excitement and infatuation of a coming-of-age love story, now with wiser and more mature characters throughout the novel. All of them have already had deeply marking experiences with love, making them almost too cautious with their feelings, but somehow, they all manage to give themselves another chance. Aciman’s characters are trying to teach us a lesson: They impose a sort of challenge for readers to let themselves be struck by love and to not forget, to not be afraid of pleasure, to live the “unlived life,” to at least stop pretending that they do not wish to be truly happy. As Aciman puts it: “You’ve lived the wrong life, my friend, and almost defaced the one you were given to live.”

Two years ago, writer-director Rian Johnson took a shot at the next installation of everyone’s favorite space epic with “Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi.” His highly controversial film had audience members in fits, asking questions like, “What is happening?” and “Why is this happening?” and “Who’s to blame for this mess?” And now, with his latest film “Knives Out,” he has audience members asking those same questions again, but this time for all the right reasons. His Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery is a unique blend of humor, mystery, and intrigue that keeps viewers guessing until the end, and it almost lives up to the lofty expectations that it sets for itself.
The morning following his 85th birthday, successful author and multimillionaire Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study, the victim of an apparent suicide. Following his funeral, gathered in their luxurious home, Harlan’s family is interviewed and scrutinized by a team headed by renowned detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). As the family members’ quirks come to light, the façade of the “happy family” starts to crumble, and motives begin to appear; it looks as though Harlan’s death may not have been a suicide after all. And as Detective Blanc says, reclining in an armchair in front of a blazing fire, “I suspect foul play.”
The first half of the film is absolutely phenomenal, bolstered by brilliant character performances, fascinating buildup, and stellar writing. The family dynamic is, by and large, what holds the entire piece together and makes the mystery worth caring about. Each one of the Thrombey family members is clearly defined and unique, and their exaggerated personalities are entertaining. Toni Collette shines as Joni Thrombey, Harlan’s widowed daughter-in-law. Through such roles as Annie in “Hereditary,” Collette has demonstrated her incredible acting skills. It is remarkable to watch her portray the spoiled and conniving Joni with such believability. Chris Evans’s performance as Ransom Drysdale, Harlon’s grandson, is also commendable. Coming off of his eight-year portrayal of Steve Rogers/Captain America, it’s refreshing to see him committing wholeheartedly to a new role, and to see how easy it is for both actor and viewer to cast off his Marvel shadow and move on to very different roles. The star of the show, however, is Craig. Sporting an uncharacteristic Southern drawl, he is both hilarious and captivating, perfectly encapsulating the character of a quirky, world-class detective and it is fascinating to watch his deductions play out throughout the film.
Rian Johnson expertly crafts the narrative, particularly in the first half. Within the first half an hour, while Detective Blanc is beginning his investigation, Johnson dumps a load of evidence, motives, and potential suspects on the viewer through a series of character interviews. This scene, in which most of the characters are introduced, is by far the most engrossing part of the film. The film demands the viewer’s attention as it begins to lay out the mystery’s puzzle pieces. It is up to the viewer to collect and interpret these pieces and to form their own theories about what could be going on in the family and who may have murdered Harlan Thrombey. Despite the presentation of a substantial amount of evidence, it never feels overwhelming. Within a short period of time, we get an extended look at the characters’ motivations and quirks, and the beginnings of what will ultimately lead up to the climactic reveal. Such scenes, where the murder mystery itself is at the forefront of the narrative, are where the film really excels.
Unfortunately, by the second half, the mystery seems to slip into the background. The characters have all been introduced, and the narrative extends beyond the home and the family itself to the greater world. At this point, the rate of revelation decreases dramatically. Breakthroughs become much less common and the story experiences an overall tonal shift. To go into more detail would reveal too much about the mystery itself, but it suffices to say that the viewer becomes much more a passive observer than they were in the first half, where intense thought and theory formulation felt actively encouraged.
Yet another of the film’s fatal flaws is that the Thrombey family feels underused in the second half of the film. The family dynamic, which is one of the most compelling features of the narrative, unfortunately takes a backseat later in the film. There are some brilliant actors (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson) whose performances feel undercut by a lack of screen time.
As far as the ending is concerned, the crux of a mystery is the “Aha!” moment that comes at the conclusion, when every piece of the mystery is wrapped up. In this case, parts of the reveal felt a bit underwhelming. Some pieces of it seem far too obvious and some of the plot revelations feel a bit forced, cringeworthy, and so unrealistic as to be almost comical. Despite these snags, however, the payoff is deserved, well-crafted, and overall effective.
Despite some narrative hiccups and a faltering second half, there is no denying that this film is just plain fun. It is enjoyable to watch the characters interact with and play off each other. The narrative is finely crafted and engaging from start to finish. When the mystery elements work, they work incredibly well. As a viewer, it is remarkably entertaining to formulate theories and watch as they are proved and disproved throughout the natural progression of the story. So grab your notebooks and go see “Knives Out.” It is definitely a mystery worth solving.

There is an enigmatic quality to classical composers that seems fodder for storytelling in all its forms: From Mozart’s life sprung Peter Shaffer’s play and film “Amadeus.” From Shostakovich’s grew Julian Barnes’s novel “The Noise of Time.” It is in this tradition that musician-author Chris Eaton takes up the life of Camille Saint-Saëns, the 19th-century French composer of “The Carnival of the Animals” and “Danse Macabre.” His novel, “Symphony No. 3” (named for Saint-Saëns’s work of the same name), is based on Saint-Saëns’s biography, but does not hesitate to venture beyond it. Eaton starts with the historical record, but transposes and alters it with his imagination. What emerges is a narrative that takes Eaton’s voice and moves at his direction.
Through the eyes of Saint-Saëns’s fictional twin brother, Eaton brings the reader on a journey from Saint-Saëns’s childhood to old age. Set in four symphonic “movements,” the story follows a sweeping arc. Saint-Saëns starts as a restless child prodigy and grows into a prolific and cherished composer entrenched in the circles of the French elite. Despite his professional success, Saint-Saëns’s search for love is a tumultuous odyssey. He finds love and then loses it, which opens a consuming and tormenting void. Saint-Saëns’s attempt to fill that void sends him on a wandering, cross-continental voyage.
A novel spanning such spatial and temporal distances, prodding such emotional depths, requires a coherent and compelling narrative to be its backbone. Yet this narrative, while chronologically straight-forward, often struggles to find its way. The plot jumps from place to place and event to event with incredible frequency. Saint-Saëns goes from home to the music conservatory and back, from Paris to Algiers to Spain to Argentina. There are so many fights and deaths that it can become difficult to ascertain what is significant and what is not. In this way, the central arc of Saint-Saëns’s story does not come to the fore, but rather struggles to distinguish itself from the more mundane elements of the novel. By lack of contrast, a potentially stirring storyline where love and loss reign supreme loses its luster.
The multitude of characters does not help the book’s cause. The focus is intended to be on Saint-Saëns and his emotional journey, but too often the voices of other characters seep through. With Berutti, Franck, “the Heiress,” and more, there are almost too many characters involved. It is difficult for characters to distinguish themselves from others, and Saint-Saëns himself sometimes gets lost amid the many voices.
But in some ways, what is this novel’s shortcoming is also part of its charm. On the page, the great figures of the era come together Saint-Saëns mingles with the French painter Gustave Courbet, or the Argentinian writer Leopoldo Lugones. One can envisage how these artistic giants might have interacted, and here, Eaton’s imagination shines through.
Eaton’s imaginative thinking also emerges through his varied prose. Some parts are rendered as a clear and uncomplicated narration, while others are given in sharp dialogue (“Do you think you knew him? / I did know him. / Perhaps my French is confusing. / It’s not confusing.”). Others still take the form of a stream-of-consciousness monologue. The book opens with the words, “Some creatures don’t deserve to live,” and proceeds to explain this statement in a nearly two-page sentence. Such constructions can be exhausting and are sometimes oddly written (“He wrote a piece that was an asteroid on a collision course…”). But Eaton’s blending of different forms leads to a diverse palette of colors that communicate with the reader in bold and interesting tones.
Eaton also provides wide-ranging commentary throughout the novel. He is fond of communicating this less through the novel’s development and more through conversations between the characters and long monologues. For instance: “What can you learn from happiness? Nothing. It is only through grief and strife that we emerge transformed. It is only through grief and strife that we find life.” As perhaps this example indicates, these broad philosophical statements can feel like platitudes. More intriguing, however, are statements that, were they not set in this novel, would seem to be referencing today. “But to win a crowd is not so great a trick,” Saint-Saëns says. “One only needs a modicum of talent, a certain dose of untruth, and a small acquaintance with human passions.”
“Symphony No. 3” thus emerges with moments dull and dry, as well as moments interesting and imaginative. As purely an exercise in storytelling, the novel is disappointing, leaving one feeling much potential is left untapped. As an art form and a commentary, however, the novel is impressive, filled with diverse, imaginative prose and grounded in a connection to today. For those to whom such writing appeals, perhaps Saint-Saëns may come to life once more.

You probably haven’t heard of dril, and you certainly wouldn’t recognize him on the street. But you might recognize tweets like this one:
"im not owned!  im not owned!!", i continue to insist as i slowly shrink and transform into a corn cob
Dril is a Twitter account with 1.4 million followers, best known for its association with the subculture called “weird Twitter.” As shown in the tweet above, the humor of “weird Twitter” is surreal, ironic, and absurd. Even as brands and politicians begin to use memes to appeal to young people, this sort of humor remains unknown to most in the mainstream. That is, until recently.
Earlier this month, Cartoon Network announced that dril and fellow “weird Twitter” poster Derek Estevez-Olsen would host a series, titled “Truthpoint: Darkweb Rising,” on the website of the network’s adult-oriented spinoff, “Adult Swim.” This announcement was surprising on two levels. First, it revealed that there is, in fact, a physical person behind dril’s pixelated Jack Nicholson avatar. And second, it proved that somehow, improbably, the market had taken an interest in “weird Twitter.”
To be clear, there’s nothing shameful about dril and Estevez-Olsen partnering with Cartoon Network when given the opportunity. The two are artists trying to make a living, and it’d be ridiculous to get mad at them for doing just that. Besides, their show is hilarious. In its first episode, dril and Estevez-Olsen debate whether money should exist, all while pastiching the personas of cripplingly online young men and right-wing conspiracy theorist talk show hosts.
But independent of the particular creators, there is something strange about a subsidiary of Warner Bros. getting into the business of making surreal memes. “Weird Twitter,” after all, isn’t just jokes; the subculture also has a strong countercultural bent, and its memes frequently satirize popular culture through a jaded, leftist lens. Dril’s tweets, in particular, have taken on a political role lately, as Twitter users juxtapose his addled syntax with that of President Trump.
And this show is far from the first attempt by corporate media to capitalize on weird internet culture. The Twitter accounts of brands including Wendy’s, MoonPie, and Denny’s have long been pushing out uncanny valley level imitations of memes popular with millennials and generation Z, such as the one below:
Good morning to everyone, except people who take our Tabasco bottles.
Perhaps this trend is inevitable — even natural — when we live in a system in which business and culture exchange ideas in a constant feedback loop. Certainly, it doesn’t give us a reason to discount dril and Estevez-Olsen: They’re amazing content creators, and we should support them by watching and enjoying their show. But this trend should remind us to be careful consumers of media.
Part of the reason people love memes so much is their use of reliable, reproducible formats to structure their jokes. Yet this same feature also makes them value-neutral, empty vessels that can be filled with almost any message, good or bad. That’s why the next time I see a brand using “weird Twitter” style humor to appeal to me I’ll stop and ask myself a question: Is this the real thing, or just the right format?

To celebrate Halloween, the Harvard Art Museums got into the festive spirit on Oct. 30 with its first of three Halloween Gallery Talks, “Witches.” Led by four curatorial fellows, the tour focused on the depiction of powerful women throughout the Museums’ collection.
The free one-hour talk took 20 guests through a selection of works on the second and third floor galleries. Each of the four curatorial fellows, Joanna Sheers Seidenstein, Sophie Lynford, Natalia Ángeles Vieyra, and Frances Gallart Marques, spent 15 minutes introducing their selected works relating to depictions of “witches.” Rather than focusing on the traditional definition of witches, the featured pieces showcased the variety in depictions of powerful women in the collection.
“We’ve been trying to collaborate, and we think that makes it more interesting for guests to see not just one perspective, but perhaps different perspectives all at once,” Marques said.
Working backward chronologically, Lynford began the talk with Gustave Moreau’s painting “The Apparition,” discussing the various theories surrounding the bloody floating head of John the Baptist. Lynford contextualized the depiction of biblical Salome, presenting the work through art historical interpretations including the Symbolist, mystical, and theological lenses.
Following a brief question-and-answer with Lynford, Seidenstein led the group to Paolo Finoglia’s painting “Joseph and Potiphar's Wife.” Seidenstein began by telling the biblical story of Joseph, then discussed alternative interpretations and characterizations of Potiphar’s wife in the Quran and contemporary texts. Her presentation involved audience engagement, and she questioned the tour group about their reactions and impressions of the image.
Vieyra then introduced the painting “Saint Rose of Lima,” the first Latin American painting to be displayed in the Fogg Museum. Vieyra focused on the story of Saint Rose as well as the symbols in the painting, from the inclusion of oversized parrots as an aesthetic preference to the inclusion of “memento mori,” or symbols of death.
To conclude the tour, Marques led the group to the third floor stairwell to see the Etruscan sculpture “Sphinx.” Marques detailed the historical significance of the sculpture as a symbol of protection, and discussed the myth of the Sphinx. Her modern interpretation of the myth highlighted the intersection between race and gender in ancient cultures. Unlike the other presentations, Marques then moved the group to two additional pieces in the Ancient Art wing to further her discussion of monstrous qualities attributed to powerful women. Referring to two Greek vessels, Marques gave an animated telling of the myth of Medusa and the myth of the Sirens, weaving contemporary retellings of the tales into her analysis.
The curatorial fellows encouraged visitors on the tour to continue engaging with the featured artworks depicting powerful women and beyond. The focus on the Museums’ less famous works through this particular lens provided a new experience for all the visitors on the tour, and persuaded some visitors to explore more.
“The blurbs tend to be purely technical and without much context, so I find the tours essential to appreciating the art more. I thought what surprised me the most was the Sphinx, because I feel in particular the statue exhibits are really bereft of descriptions,” said Drey Cardinal, a visitor on the tour.
The tour’s discussion of the intersections of race, culture, history, and gender also surprised many visitors.
“Personally I found most interesting the two new Latin American pieces, and talking about the cultural exchanges there. It made me want to learn more,” said Travis Wolven, another visitor on the tour.
Both Cardinal and Wolven expressed an interest in returning to the museum over the next two days to participate in the following two gallery talks in the series, “Haunted Museums” and “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper.” The Museums will continue to plan Gallery Talks over the coming months, encouraging visitors to return and experience new perspectives on their collection.

When it comes to slaying spooky season, the stars undoubtedly do it best. I mean, if we had a posse of professional makeup artists and costume designers (not to mention a lavish Halloween bash to attend), we would probably go all-out, too. From the ultra sexy to the downright wacky, here are the greatest Halloween getups celebrities have pulled off in recent years.
5. Heidi Klum as an Old Lady
Under all those faux wrinkles is supermodel Heidi Klum, believe it or not. The former “Project Runway” host doubles as the commander-in-chief of Halloween, apparently: This year marks the 20th installment of her famous annual Halloween costume party. As for Klum’s 2013 Granny Heidi look, the magic is in the details. From varicose veins and some wicked prosthetics to the nanna-approved purse, this elderly moment is scary convincing. Work it, grandma.
4. Kylie Jenner as Xtina
Kylie Jenner took us back to the glory-filled early aughts with her spot-on rendition of Christina Aguilera’s Xtina-era uniform. The look is straight out of Aguilera’s iconic music video for her 2002 hit, “Dirrty” — complete with butt-less chaps and a black-streaked blonde wig. Long live the 2000s.
3. Beyoncé as Barbie
What kind of costume countdown would this be without Bey’s internet-breaking Barbie doll transformation? Complete with her own box, the Queen recreated the famous black-and-white swimsuit worn by the very first Barbie doll introduced in 1959. Jay-Z joined in on the fun, too, in a dapper vintage Ken costume. Life in plastic, it’s fantastic.
2. LeBron James as Pennywise
It’s safe to say that LeBron was going for a — to put it lightly — downright horrifying vibe with this one. Standing close to seven-feet tall, the b-baller took Stephen King’s killer clown to the next level. And we’re not here for it. Then again, we kind of are. The clown suit is exquisitely detailed, after all… vomit-inducing and detailed.
1. Heidi Klum as Jessica Rabbit
Talk about va va voom. Mistress of Halloween Heidi Klum claims not one but two spots on this list for sheer commitment. With the help of some serious prosthetics, Klum morphed into arguably the most well-known sex symbol in animation. She even documented the process of becoming Jessica Rabbit on her Instagram, showing how a team of artists helped her achieve those impossible measurements with loads of fake skin. The result? Klum became a living, breathing cartoon, and Halloween was never the same again.

Eight years after the release of literary darling “The Night Circus,” fans have the chance to put a new Erin Morgenstern novel in their hands. Morgenstern’s second novel, “The Starless Sea,” is a whimsical fantasy that tells the story of Zachary, a gamer who finds an old, mysterious book at the library that contains a detailed account of a moment in his childhood. In honor of the moment so many readers have been waiting for, Morgenstern spoke with The Harvard Crimson about “The Starless Sea,” video games, myth-making, and her ideas for her next big project.
The Harvard Crimson: Did you find any surprising similarities or surprising differences when writing “The Starless Sea” versus “The Night Circus?”
Erin Morgenstern: I think it was different in some ways because I had to approach it differently, because no one was waiting for “The Night Circus.” And people were waiting for this one. I couldn’t abandon it because I had to finish it. It was something that I had to take more seriously. But at the same time the writing process remains just as messy and sprawling and unorganized as it is each time. I think that just is the way I write a book; I have to write it wrong first. I have to try different things and explore different ideas — write, rewrite, and rewrite some more — before I get the book shape.
THC: You rewrote this book several times before you got the final version we have now. What did you think was missing in those rewrites that we got in the final draft?
EM: A lot of things. I think I have a tendency to wander off in further directions and off into subplots and into things I don’t necessarily need. A lot of the rewriting is pulling back on those and focusing more on finding where the focus was and what the arc is and kind of getting more focus on Zachary. Plot is not my strong suit. I have these spaces in my head, and I focus more on atmosphere and tone. It takes me a while to define the right scenarios to navigate my way through an imaginary space with. So really finding what I wanted to say with it, where it was going. Someone different was the Owl King in every single draft.
THC: Most people would think of you as an atmospheric writer. How do you create that feeling of atmosphere? What do you think makes that your strong suit?
EM: I’m a very visual person. I didn’t set out to be a writer, I don’t really think writing — like, actual prose writing — is my strong suit at all. I know I do bad things with commas all the time. But I’m so visual that I have all these spaces in my head, I can see it in my brain and what I need to do in the writing process is take that space that exists in my head already and I know how it’s lit, I know how the furniture is upholstered, I know all the little digital details of the space that I have. And I need to figure out the right words to put on the paper so that when the reader reads it, they can conjure a similar sort of space in their head.
I always go back to trying to hit as many sensory tones as I can. I like to describe how spaces are lit or how things smell and kind of give you a fuller impression of that space and what’s going on. Because I think in fiction that people don’t describe how things smell nearly as much as they should. Lighting is the other one. I studied lighting design in college and as a theater major… When you describe a room then describe how it’s lit, you can change the tone entirely. By having just one candle on a table or there are overhead fluorescent lights, the same room has a completely different tone.
THC: “The Night Circus” was set in a historical European setting. Did you find it easier to root “The Starless Sea” in 21st century America? Was it easier or was it more challenging because you knew your readers were super familiar with this landscape?
EM: It was easier to have the baseline but it was harder because I didn’t want to date it too much. And at first, I didn’t want to put a specific year on it, and then I ended up committing to January 2015, because that’s when I wrote all of that initial early Zachary-on-campus-in-January stuff. All that winter it snowed a lot so that’s why it’s so, so snowy in there. But then I didn’t want to do too much. I didn’t want to focus too much on little everyday modern things. I wanted to get rid of his cellphone as soon as possible and that sort of thing. So it could just then go off into feeling sort of timeless because one of the things I wanted to do from the get go is something that felt new and old at the same time.
THC: Zachary is studying Emerging Media and is a gamer. How did video games impact your writing process?
EM: I think for me, it was one of those lightbulb moments. I thought maybe Zachary was like an English major or something. Then in 2014, I was playing Dragon Age, thinking about how RPG narratives work and how you can have different versions of the same story based on the player choices you may make. I could play it one way, and you can play in another way and make different decisions. And it’s like, it’s a different story. But what’s the real story? I kind of just got a bug in my head about that way, the narrative thing to think about.... When I first sat down to write, I thought I was writing about books. This is sort of my tagline: I thought I was writing a book about books, but it turned into a book about stories.
THC: Your books come with their own mythology, and you build these legends that are the backbone of the book. How do you come up with these stories?
EM: I mean, I wish I knew because then I could just do it again. I think a lot of it happens organically and they start with a symbols. I kind of knew that I wanted a Morgenstern novel to feel like a Morgenstern novel and this was my chance. Basically, the second book is where I get to establish what that is. “The Night Circus” is very much its own thing. Then to come in and do something new but still have it feel like me, that was my chance to define that a little bit.
I knew that one of the things that worked so well about “The Night Circus” as far as the aesthetic was the color scheme. But I didn’t want to lean too heavily on a color scheme for this one. I thought, “Well, what is it that still has that sort of visual flavor?” So very, very early on, I was playing with symbol. Symbols that would appear on different things and symbols that would have different meanings at different times. I had a bunch of them and then eventually settled down on the ones that are in the book, because I wanted to feel like it had some visual vocabulary. And then it did end up having a little bit a color scheme because everything was subterranean and beeswax candles dipped in gold.
THC: Where do you think that ability comes from?
EM: I think it’s a combination of things. I think I was a mythology kid, particularly into Greek and Egyption when I was little.... The thing I always go back to is not wanting to feel like anything in particular, like the time and place stuff. [“The Starless Sea”] really touches on Greek [mythology] more than anything, for two reasons. It has a Persephone underworld tone, and then also — I never looked this up, but 90 percent sure it was a Greek mythology thing that I was reading but it had a little footnote on something that had Fate listed as a consort of Time. And my brain just went, “Oh, what would that be like?” Because those are two very different things. Time‘s a constant in love with a variable and that’s kind of fascinating. And because I thought that was so interesting, and I thought I might want to use it I didn’t look up anything else about what the actual mythology is. So I just took that little nugget of info and then went off and built something with it.
THC: What’s more fun to write: the character who knows more about the world but is holding their cards close to their chest, or someone like Zachary, who is like the reader and thrown in, trying to figure out what’s happening and uncovering things?
EM: I think for me, it’s a little more fun to write that Zachary kind of POV. To write the person trying to figure it out. Beyond that, creating a more active, detective, questing kind of role, making it a little more organic point of view, because I get to take those steps in a logical way instead of trying to be like, “Well, how much at this point is this person hiding?” It’s a little more calculated. But Zachary was also really fun for me to write because he’s me. He reacts to things the way that I think I would react to them. It’s that, “Oh, this got weird. I need to go sit with my cat and think about it for awhile” kind of thing. Everybody’s me in one way or another, but he was me and how I would react in the situation, so that was fun for me to write.
THC: I know it’s very soon, your book isn’t even out yet — but do you have a seed of an idea for your next project? Or is it just time for a break?
EM: I think I will probably take a break. But I have a pile of little single lines and little things that I might want to play with. I definitely don’t know what it is yet. I haven’t really gotten into writing, but I sort of know where I want to go for the next big project. Also, “The Night Circus” is such an autumnal book, and “The Starless Sea” is very much a winter book, so I feel like I kind of have to do a spring book. It feels like a natural progression. I’m already writing down things about cherry blossoms and rain and trying to figure out where I want to go.
I’ve actually already cleared my schedule to do basically nothing through February to April/May. So I can hopefully close myself away and that that’s enough time to figure out what this wants to be. Then I can start the process of writing and rewriting. It hopefully won’t take quite as long as this one did.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his most recent thrilling spy novel, John Le Carré continues to impress audiences with stories of espionage, deceit, friendship, and despair. In “Agent Running in the Field,” Le Carré spins the excellent tale of an aging British intelligence agent tasked with facing down Moscow and her sleeper agents, a wife who disapproves of his role, and friends who are more than he could ever imagine. With settings from Trafalgar Square to Karlovy Vary, the story takes readers across the expanse of modern Europe and deep into the vexing political landscape that is a staple of our current times. Although similar in structure to many of his previous novels, Le Carré takes a new step with “Agent Running in the Field” through creative dialogue, intriguing characters, and a fulfilling plot.
Although enticing and thrilling in the last two-thirds, this novel’s first act progresses slowly. Spending a significant portion of the first act establishing characters and the many relationships of the protagonist, aging agent Nathaniel – Nat by his friends — pages blur together in exposition of days gone by. As a Cold War agent in Eastern Europe, Nat experienced the worst of what a field operative could experience, and with his wife by his side in Moscow — the cold beating heart of the enemy — he never forgot those days. With the many characters of Nat’s clashing personal and professional life well-established, the story makes a marked change as he is reassigned after down time to head a small, rundown compound nicknamed The Haven coordinated through the London General Office.
Once readers are immersed in The Haven, “Agent Running in the Field” begins to truly excel as a both a novel and as a point of reflection for our muddled, dishonest political sphere. As the story excites and the characters grow and develop, the literary prowess of Le Carré becomes clear. With his distinctive method of conversation, the words on the page begin drifting through the reader’s mind as Nat interacts with undercover Soviet sleeper agents or passes sweet nothings into the ears of his precious wife Prue. In the heat of the story, the keen relationship between the protagonist and his wife is well demonstrated as Le Carré writes, “One glance at my face, she rises and without a word unlocks the conservatory door to the garden.” By straying from the norm of unremarkable dialogue and delving deep into the mind and hidden reactions of Nat and the other characters, the world is seen clearly through his eyes, tinged with his experiences and vibrant memories. Because of this intriguing and simply-human method of communication and thought, Nat’s life becomes the reader’s.
Above his style, Le Carré’s use of deception as an author only adds to the intrigue of this political thrill-ride. With diverging and converging stories passing by page-to-page, the lack of connection between events remains unquestioned as this literary world is interpreted and felt through Nat’s perspective. The powerful use of gentle and eloquent foreshadowing changes the way individuals are seen. Truly, Le Carré manages to put the reader into the headspace of Nat and experience his life first-hand. Even as friends fade away and old projects rebound, the memories of these individuals and specific missions come and go as if they are the thoughts of the reader. Thinking back to the memory of one of his operatives, Nat remarks, “At sixteen he is again spotted, this time by the KGB trained as an undercover agent and tasked with the infiltration of Christian counter-revolutionary elements in northern Ossetia.” Truly, “Agent Running in the Field” shows the best of what Le Carré has cultivated over his long and successful career in spy novels.
Although the superficial plot resembles that of his other works, Le Carré provides an exciting journey like none before. The life of Nat, his colleagues, and his friends becomes that of the reader. With the expeditions across Europe and global influence accounted for, the story feels pertinent and exciting on every page. Truly, Le Carré provides an excellent story of life in the present day in his newest stunning novel, “Agent Running in the Field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, the Harvard Art Museums gave patrons gallery tours of all things witchy and morbid in keeping with the theme of the season. For the final of the three gallery talks, three research fellows presented pieces within the museum that depict an element of death from within their respective fields of study.
First, Katherine Mintie, a research fellow in photography, presented a Civil War battlefield photograph. Called “The Harvest of Death,” the photograph shows the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg and was taken by Timothy O’Sullivan and printed by Alexander Gardner in 1863. Mintie explained that at the time, the only way to capture the horror of war was to photograph the aftermath of a battle, as the camera had to be held in the same position for several minutes.
“They really shocked American audiences who had not yet seen warfare in such a gruesome and detailed way,” Mintie said.
Mintie added that the impact of such an image might lose its punch with modern audiences.
“While it is very shocking and affecting, we have seen images like this before — either actual images of battles or we’ve seen this in television and movies. In some ways we’ve become sort of accustomed in a strange way to images of death and violence,” Mintie said.
Gabriella Szalay, a curation fellow specializing in German art, then presented a lime-wood sculpture of Saint Anthony Abbot by Tilman Riemenschneider, a German sculptor in the late 15th century. The sculpture was just one figure from a larger altarpiece which was originally displayed in churches to entertain the congregation during mass. Saint Anthony Abbot was most closely associated with “Saint Anthony’s Fire,” a fatal and brutal disease also known as ergotism that was transmitted for over 1,000 years. Szalay explained that those inflicted would frequently visit church to pray to Saint Anthony to rid them of the disease.
“So this tiny little figure is actually something that offers a lot of hope to people who are facing death every single day,” Szalay said of the figurine.
According to Szalay, even the sculpture itself was in the process of dying, as tiny holes in the wood indicated a species of worm that had slowly eaten away at the figure before it was recovered.
Once Szalay finished her analysis of the figurine, Julie Wertz, a conservation science fellow, presented a selection of ceramic jars placed in tombs for carrying wine and food into the afterlife.
“We know from cultures all over the world that it is really, really important when you die to be ready for the afterlife,” Wertz said.
While these jars have an inherently morbid connotation, Wertz also discussed the forensic elements of her research, complete with infrared and ultraviolet scans of clay pigments. The resulting photographs demonstrated the history and providence of each jar, such as which ancient pigments they used or what previous restorations had been made.
“I enjoyed it immensely, I thought it was very informative, I thought our tour guides were extremely knowledgeable,” museum visitor Alexandra L. West said. “I thought it was very innovative that they chose this theme.”
Other visitors said they agreed that the content of the talks seemed fitting for the season.
“I always go to the talks, but it was Halloween and it seemed appropriate,” Mark H. Thiemens, a Harvard visiting professor of physics, said. “As always, on the tours there is a nice variety of what they cover, from the Civil War to 100 B.C.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the 2010s come to a close, the "Decade in Review" series will seek to single out the best 10 best films from the 10 biggest genres. While fantasy, one of Hollywood’s oldest genres, has undoubtedly waned in recent years, the 2010s still offered a plethora of standouts, from blockbuster franchises to indie directors and auteur filmmakers.
(See Part 1/10: Science Fiction)
10. “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” (2013), dir. Peter Jackson
It goes without saying that “The Hobbit” pales in comparison to Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, and “Desolation” still suffers from some of the series’ problems, albeit to a lesser extent (drawn-out exposition and unnecessary plot threads). However, "Desolation" injects the "Hobbit" series with much-needed dramatic tension, particularly through its climactic conflict between Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smaug the dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch). The impeccable casting, combined with astounding visual effects and breathtaking art direction, is enough to transport audiences back to Middle-earth for a welcome entry in the saga, even if “Desolation” doesn’t meet the fittingly lofty standards of devoted Tolkien fans.
9. “Paddington” (2014), dir. Paul King
Excessively sweet to the point of almost giving you a toothache, every frame of Paul King’s “Paddington” exudes the lighthearted innocence of its marmalade-loving, titular teddy-bear protagonist. “Paddington” celebrates eye-popping cinematography with saturated color grading, meticulously staged frames-within-frames, and beautiful symmetry (in other words, shots that may have just been pulled from a Wes Anderson film).
8. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” (2010), dir. David Yates
Even though “Deathly Hallows: Part 1” feels like a forced split with its counterpart, Yates’ fantasy epic still meets expectations as the first entry of a rewarding finale. After Yates streamlined the longest Harry Potter novel (“Order of the Phoenix”) into a 142-minute film, it’s unsurprising that the 146-minute long “Deathly Hallows: Part 1” occasionally suffers from uneven pacing. As the series developed, the characters and themes did too, and seeing the evolution of series-long arcs, such as good versus evil and a “chosen one” narrative evolve into parallels of racism and terrorism is especially refreshing from a fantasy film.
7. “The Jungle Book” (2016), dir. Jon Favreau
Favreau’s thoroughly immersive retelling of Disney’s classic animation is not only a technological marvel, but one that preserves the childish heart and joy that made the original so beloved. While "The Jungle Book" is more computer animation than live-action (with the only "live" element of the film being Mowgli, played by Neel Sethi), “The Jungle Book” is a step forward in terms of industry standards for computer graphics. If charming art direction and a trip down memory lane aren't convincing enough, seeing Christopher Walken play a monstrously tall prehistoric ape and croon “I Wan'na Be Like You” in his iconic voice may be sufficient to make a visit to “Jungle Book” worthwhile.
6. “The Life of Pi” (2012), dir. Ang Lee
It’s impossible to separate Ang Lee’s epic story from the technological revolutions that made the story possible. The tiger, Richard Parker, is computer-generated with every strand of hair and facial muscle individually animated to completely suspend disbelief. “Life of Pi” balances its deeply human core (told through flashbacks from an older Pi reflecting on his life, starting from childhood) and its thematic heft, dealing with the endurance of the human spirit and friendship, with breathtaking cinematography. The wilderness was depicted with a mundane hostility in “Cast Away,” was uncompromisingly bleak in “The Revenant,” but in "The Life of Pi,” nature is at times frightening, but at others, vibrant and wondrous.
5. “A Monster Calls” (2016) dir. J.A. Bayona
Arguably the smallest scale film on this list, “A Monster Calls” is an introspective meditation on catharsis and healing. At its core is a story about a boy’s (Connor, played by Lewis MacDougall) journey to accepting the inevitable fate of his terminally ill mother. The story enhances the audience’s understanding of Connor, peeling back the five stages of grief, through the appearance of a monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) in Connor’s imagination who teaches him parables with unexpected messages. “A Monster Calls” is an incredibly therapeutic film that tackles such deep themes of child trauma, loss, and confusion.
4. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” (2011) dir. David Yates
The final film of a storied franchise (that has since underwhelmed with its “Fantastic Beasts” continuation), “Deathly Hallows: Part 2” ends one of the most successful film franchises in a satisfying fashion. Yates walks the delicate balance between overdone spectacle and fan service, from the bombastic hour-long battle for Hogwarts to ticking all the necessary narrative beats of Rowling’s children’s classic. Yates and Rowling effectively find new ways of incorporating prior aspects of the series' mythology so viewers never feel lost, but rather like they're learning in a world that feels tangibly lived-in.
3. “Hugo” (2011), dir. Martin Scorsese
As wondrously fantastical as it is touching, “Hugo” is a tour-de-force of modern cinematic technique and a celebration of the history of a medium that transformed entertainment culture. At the center of “Hugo” is a series of enigmas from the unknown purpose of the automaton (the machine that Hugo and his late father had tried to restore) to the cantankerous toy shop owner Papa Georges, and the film unearths the secrets of its characters as it unravels the secrets of cinema. These questions are elevated with a mysterious score from composer Howard Shore and restrained editing from Thelma Schoonmaker. “Hugo” is also beautifully shot in 3D with incredible cinematography from Robert Richardson (a frequent collaborator with such landmark directors as Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, and Quentin Tarantino) that captures the saturated mustards, browns, and blues of vibrant early-20th century Paris. As a family-friendly fantasy, “Hugo” is a departure from common Scorsese repertoire, but it’s just as passionately made as the cinematic icon’s most committed works.
2. “The Shape of Water” (2017), dir. Guillermo Del Toro
"The Shape of Water" doubles as both a timely tale of tolerance and understanding as well as a political allegory of Cold War-era American ideals of individualism and success. Acclaimed fantasy director Guillermo Del Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth,” “Hellboy,” and “Pacific Rim”) twists fairy tale tropes on their head by taking an archetypal plot but changing setting and characters to tell an entirely different story. On paper, “The Shape of Water” is an odd film: A mute woman named Elisa Sally Hawkins), who works as a cleaner in a Cold War era military facility, decides to rescue an Amazonian river god (Doug Jones) who’s been captured by the authorities. With stunning practical effects that transformed Jones into the Amphibian Man, a tearfully resonant performance from Hawkins, and a frighteningly menacing performance from Michael Shannon as colonel Richard Strickland, the characters in “The Shape of Water” never feel like caricatures as they so often do in fantasy films. Combined with a hauntingly romantic score from Alexandre Desplat, “The Shape of Water” is a cornerstone of what the fantasy genre can and should offer.
1. “Midnight in Paris” (2011), dir. Woody Allen
Disarmingly romantic and hopelessly nostalgic, “Midnight in Paris” unravels its dichotomy of themes of celebrating the past and living in the present. At the stroke of midnight, Hollywood screenwriter Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), who’s suffering a bout of writer’s block, is magically transported back in time to 1920s Paris, a period he reveres, where he finds himself surrounded by his idols from Hemingway to Picasso, and even falls in love with a woman from the time Adriana (Marion Cotillard). With Allen’s sharp, witty screenplay, his characters’ electric dialogue exchanges spring off the page with innate spontaneity and their words are executed with great comedic timing from a balanced ensemble cast that also stars Rachel McAdams, Adrien Brody, Léa Seydoux, and Tom Hiddleston. Although the film faces the risk of simply devolving into another French tourism board promotion of the famed city, “Midnight in Paris” fully embodies the romanticism that Paris represents to its evocative protagonist through meticulously engineered amber lighting captured by cinematographer Darius Khondji, and an ever-wistful Grammy-winning soundtrack. However, this artistic achievement doesn't excuse Woody Allen from "Me Too" allegations that led Amazon Studios to drop a five-picture deal in February 2019. However, if one can separate art from the artist, “Midnight in Paris” is endlessly re-watchable and epitomizes the magic of cinema.

On Oct. 28, a rainy evening, the Harvard ArtLab hosted a performance titled “Koizumi,” an experimental work by the Boston Arts Collective, MASARY, and musician Jean Laurenz. The work centered around the life of Lafcadio Hearn, an intellectual from the 19th century who was the great-great-uncle of Jean Laurenz, the trumpetist of the performance. The piece focused on the supernatural element of his writings.
The work comprised a 50-minute music performance overlaid with video projections of different designs and animations produced by the group. The artists performed the piece in a white, four-walled room. Jean Laurenz, Maria Finkelmeier, and Ryan Edwards stood in front of the audience playing the piece while Sam Okerstrom-Lam managed the sound and projections from the back of the room. In the center of the stage, the artists placed a snare drum with a light shining underneath it and a big white circle in the right upper section of the background wall that resembled a full moon.
"We wanted to have Lafcadio on stage somehow,” Finkelmeier said during a question and answer session.
During the performance, the three artists shifted across the space, approaching the steel drum in front or stepping on raised surfaces to make their presence stick out of the scene. The artists composed the original piece collaboratively and incorporated some spoken Japanese and unintelligible whispering as part of the composition.
During his life, Lafcadio lived in Greece, Dublin, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Martinique. In Ohio, he married Alethea Foley, who was born into slavery — a marriage illegal at the time in the state. A journalist and a writer, he dealt extensively with subjects related to the places he lived. He is most recognized for his ghost stories, which introduced Japanese ghost folktales to the west. Though Laurenz has known about Lafcadio for her whole life, she did not become interested in him until more recently. Her father dug up the particular character from the family history, and after some time, she took an interest of her own.
“I think I read a ghost story about a woman who was dying, and she suddenly became possessed. Her last feelings and thoughts were jealousy towards this other young woman who would then become her husband’s wife,” Laurenz said of how she became interested in Lafcadio’s story.
Lafcadio’s life is full of a multiplicity of cultures.
“We are nodding to the intercultural. We are taking away the words though and just trying to address the feelings behind the words, the stories,” Laurenz said. “Then there isn’t a descriptor that pigeonholes the piece.”
After the performance, people collected feedback from the audience, taking notes on clipboards near the exit of the ArtLab. The work was supposed to be a piece of art in the process. The ArtLab is a house for the artistic process. The ArtLab, which opened earlier this semester, is a space for artistic experimentation, but its concrete role is not yet defined.
“We are co-creating the program with the Harvard Community,” Bree Edwards, the director of the Harvard ArtLab, said. “It would be limiting if one person determined what would be done.”
During its first year, the ArtLab will focus on public events like “Koizumi,” bringing in the public to experience the space. Next year, the ArtLab wants to shift its efforts toward its resident program. Edwards said the organization will provide a space for multidisciplinary collaboration where artists and non-artists from a multitude of disciplines and from all over Boston can come together to build great projects.

HONK! Festival of Activist Street bands returned to Somerville for the 14th consecutive year, rounding off the three days of festivities with a parade to Harvard Square on Oct.13. Boasting 25 brass bands from across the country and internationally, HONK!, coinciding with the Oktoberfest market, attracted hundreds to the streets. Displays of eccentric costuming, political chants, and verve ran alongside numerous skills share workshops and talks on music and activism. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Mike W. Smith, Jon M. Cox, and Erin T. Allen, members of the Chicago-based band Environmental Encroachment, about increasing access to music and the purpose underlying all the fun.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: You take your brass band instruments and introduce your own swing. Can you speak to your musical style at all? What influences you?
JON M. COX: It sort of varies. We take some classic rock tunes and brass line them.
Since Environmental Encroachment has been coming here for so long, we also do a tune share with some other bands so sometimes we play some of their own songs. We play stuff from the New Orleans tradition, Balkan and Klezmer tradition...

ERIN T. ALLEN: Western, Moroccan trance…

MIKE W. SMITH: Funk. Some funk.

JMC: Basically, the mission statement is to get people moving and having fun. Shake that booty.
THC: There were definitely people dancing in front of the stage! What do you think is the importance of coming to a festival like this for your band?
MARTIN J. MILAN: Spreading the love of music, bringing people together, and inspiring people to do more stuff like this.

THC: And as an activist band, do you join in protests at all?

MWS: We went to Cook County Women’s Jail and performed for the women’s prisoners which was really outstanding. And fairly recently we performed for a guy who was jailed illegally at a fundraiser and they raised enough money to get him out. We also do the largest food drive in Chicago called CHIditarod which is really fun. They get all these creative teams together and have a shopping cart race. And we do a lot of community things.

ETA: As a regular guest in the band, I want to say that there’s something activist about being such an open band and inviting people to join this crazy family.

MWS: Our band has a strange way of accepting people. A lot of bands are very closed-off and competitive. At HONK!, everyone shares musicians and songs. The importance of coming is very deep; you could write a dissertation on it. It stems into reeducating kids and adults who are not psyched about music and what music can do. It’s about finding a use for public spaces. It’s about bringing together people of all ages. It’s about bringing communities’ finances together which HONK! did for Somerville.

JMC: For so many music festivals these days, the ticket prices aren’t for local people.
This is an amazing free festival that’s for the local community to come out and have fun and reclaim public spaces...

ETA: ...And connect with each other in ways they wouldn’t have otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In celebration of the release of Kanye West’s newest album, “Jesus Is King,” we’re taking a look back at the artist’s prolific career. Keep reading for a complete ranking of West’s solo albums to date.
9. “ye” (2018)
In short, “ye” is bad. Underwritten, rushed, and arguably unfinished, “ye” depicts West at his lowest: spontaneous, paranoid, yet still self-assured enough to deliver controversial social commentary. Opener “I Thought About Killing You” reads like a twisted love letter from a madman. On “Yikes,” West gives an unneeded take on the #MeToo movement, and “Wouldn’t Leave” sounds like a confessional, but West continues to defend his irresponsible decision to call slavery a “choice.” “ye” is the product of a very disorganized and chaotic period of West’s life. In a better world, it would be a quick forgettable detour. West was arguably overworked in the summer of 2018, producing five albums in rapid succession, and his “Kids See Ghosts” collaboration with Kid Cudi demonstrates his ability to shine in a duo. Unfortunately, “ye” is more likely the first in what will become a string of underwhelming solo efforts from West.
8. “Jesus Is King” (2019)
Kanye goes gospel. “Jesus Is King” suffers from the same haphazard song construction of “ye,” resulting in an 11-track album with a 27-minute runtime. The mixes sound unfinished — don’t be surprised if they’re updated in the next few weeks. It is striking that West’s biggest genre departure to date lacks urgency. Critics of artistic risks like “808s & Heartbreak” still acknowledged their importance; “Jesus Is King,” though, risks being remembered as West’s first inessential album. It is hard to imagine any of these songs having a staying power that rivals other religious-minded tracks like “Jesus Walks.” That song spoke to West’s struggle to live a pious life in a vice-ridden community. Messages like those propel religious music — the genre succeeds because it seeks to understand the world through God’s lens. “Jesus Is King” is only concerned with West bragging about his newfound religiosity: West boasts about getting into heaven on “Selah” and uses “On God” to complain about the IRS and fan reactions to exorbitant merch prices. In the end, “Jesus Is King” sounds too rushed for the Christian themes to make a lasting impact. West refuses to choose between emulating gospel and selling overpriced sneakers and hoodies. Perhaps that’s because he fails to see any difference.
7. “The College Dropout” (2004)
Kanye’s first album may well be his most bloated. The numerous skits and cutaways ubiquitous in its era have not stood the test of time. That said, when “The College Dropout” excels, it shows West at his peak. Songs like “Jesus Walks” and “Through The Wire” will be remembered long after he abandons music to become an evangelical preacher. And “Dropout” deals with themes West continues to come back to: his faith (“Jesus Walks”), his friends (“Never Let Me Down”), and his fatalism (“Through The Wire”). The bloat keeps “The College Dropout” from being among his best albums, but the work at large is a signal of West’s developing talent, the boost he needed to fully pursue a solo career.
6. “Late Registration” (2005)
“Late Registration” is impressive mainly because it was released only a year after “Dropout,” but demonstrates a clear lyrical and sonic progression from his previous work. “Touch The Sky” and “Gold Digger” are roaring crowd-pleasers that still sound fresh almost 15 years after the fact, but some of the album’s best moments occur when it deals with darker topics. “Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)” addresses the pitfalls of fame by focusing on the most lavish of purchases: jewelry. “Gone” could have been one of the best album closers in recent memory: “Shorties at the door ‘cause they need more / Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs / They said, ‘Sorry, Mr. West is gone.’” But with the addition of two comparatively needless tracks (an original mix of “Diamonds”, “Late”), the mid-2000s bloat strikes again.
5. “Graduation” (2007)
“Graduation” is West’s first album free of filler tracks. Every song, even the mediocre ones, fulfill a purpose in demonstrating West’s transcendence of traditional hip-hop. “Stronger” is the most remembered track — for good reason — but tracks like “Everything I Am” and “Homecoming” show West at his most vulnerable. “Homecoming” was also the most successful collaboration from any Coldplay member until The Chainsmokers’ “Something Just Like This,” and even then, “Homecoming” evokes a feeling of nostalgia the synth-filled Chainsmokers track fails to find. Braggadocious Kanye is still here, most evidently on “Can’t Tell Me Nothing,” making the sharp left turn of his next album, “808s & Heartbreak,” all the more unexpected.
4. “The Life Of Pablo” (2016)
The bloat strikes back. Filled with interludes and double meanings, “The Life Of Pablo” was a precursor to West’s future release setbacks. It appeared West was back with the release of the stunning “Only One” and the catchy “FourFiveSeconds” (he was not). West was set to release a new track each week during a promotion known as GOOD Fridays. Only two were released. And like other albums, it was believed “The Life Of Pablo” was finished when released. Subsequent updates ultimately made the album better and more coherent. The addition of “Saint Pablo” in particular was worthwhile, as it is a much better closer than “Fade.” West’s misses hold the album back, though. The gospel influence that worked on “Ultralight Beam” failed on “Low Lights.” The egotistical delivery of “Yeezus” sounded unnecessary on songs like “Feedback,” “Freestyle 4,” and “Facts.” But “The Life Of Pablo” has a full album’s worth of great tracks. Songs such as “FML” and “Real Friends” deal with emotional trauma similar to “808s & Heartbreak.” “Famous,” while bombastic, deftly samples Nina Simone. Ultimately, “The Life Of Pablo” can best be summed up by West’s extended verse in “No More Parties In LA:” overlong, but impressively so.
3. “Yeezus” (2013)
Opaque, industrial, and postmodern, West’s sixth album “Yeezus” sharply divided fans and critics alike. Much of its criticism is warranted. The album is not “easy listening” by any stretch of the term, but its raw aggression and self-absorption make an artistic point that remains salient today. West took a stark turn on “Yeezus,” proclaiming that he was a God and demanding more of his fans than ever before. But West at his most angry also produces spectacular moments. “Blood on the Leaves” has his best beat drop to date. His roundabout way of asking for forgiveness during “Bound 2” contains some of his most intricate rhyming. Samples on “Send It Up” give the track a reggae twist. “Yeezus” had the potential to be just as influential as some of West’s earlier work, but we may need to wait a few more years to fully judge its impact. Make no mistake: If mumble rap gives way to a more aggressive era, “Yeezus” will be claimed as its inception.
2. “808s & Heartbreak” (2008)
If “Yeezus” divided West’s fans, “808s & Heartbreak” divided the hip-hop world. A product of despair, the album precipitated the rise of a more emotional and vulnerable rap that allowed stars like Drake to rise. In “808s & Heartbreak,” West strips his music down to its raw elements and constructs a synth-based sound that emphasizes his lyrics. Some of its results are truly unforgettable: “Love Lockdown” has a legendary drum beat and the wailing hook on “Heartless” takes on a life of its own. “808s & Heartbreak” may be West’s deepest work. Forgotten tracks like “Say You Will” and “Street Lights” display a range that answered the question of whether West is truly a great rapper. The answer to that question never mattered, since his work cannot be separated from his own production and songwriting. And when casual rap fans grimaced at “808s & Heartbreak”’ divergence from the sound of “Graduation,” other artists noticed. While it may not be his most appreciated work, “808s & Heartbreak” is certainly his most important.
1. “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” (2010)
“My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” fits a coveted musical archetype: The Artist, besieged on all sides, retreats to seclusion to record his greatest work yet. In the aftermath of the Taylor Swift VMAs incident, West disappeared from the public eye to a recording studio in Hawaii. Over the course of almost a year of sessions, West pushed featured artists like Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross to their limits, resulting in verses for “Monster” and “Devil In A New Dress” that may be the peaks of their respective careers. “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” is expansive, overbearing, and fantastical, but West stands under the Sword of Damocles and makes everything work. It seems insane that “All Of The Lights” could support 10 different singers (including Elton John), but the song somehow is more than the sum of its parts. The range of samples is truly impressive, as West takes pieces of King Crimson (“POWER”), Bon Iver (“Lost In The World”), and Gil Scott-Heron (“Who Will Survive In America”). The standout, however, is “Runaway,” a nine-minute opus that distills West to his very core. “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” lays a claim to best album of the decade.

Nirvana’s landmark album, “MTV Unplugged in New York,” turned 25 this week. The prolific band’s final release, recorded a mere four months before the death of frontman Kurt Cobain, cemented the band’s legacy not just as the pioneers of grunge rock, but also as a cultural phenom that lives on in the hearts of listeners today.
Within the limited scope of Nirvana’s releases, “Unplugged” is a standout. Its acoustic instrumentation reveals Cobain’s piercing vocals, each note cutting through the calm of the intimate performance. Along with the standard lineup of Cobain on rhythm guitar, Krist Novoselic on bass, and Dave Grohl on drums, the album also featured regular Nirvana session guitarist Pat Smear and cellist Lori Goldston. Members of the sludgy alternative rock band, the Meat Puppets, joined in on three of their songs: “Plateau,” “Oh Me,” and “Lake of Fire.”
For me, a decently awkward and overly angsty middle schooler, Nirvana felt like a godsend. The blistering energy of songs like “Stay Away” and “School,” as well as the existential woe of “Pennyroyal Tea” and “Lithium” spoke directly to the (admittedly superficial) frustrations of my early adolescence. It wasn’t until I found “Unplugged,” however, that I felt like I finally knew Nirvana. In sharp contrast the unbridled rage of “Bleach,” the pseudo-commercial, polished sound of “Nevermind,” and even the sophisticated and tortured themes of “In Utero,” “Unplugged” is strikingly honest. By the time I pressed play, Nirvana had been gone for almost two decades, and yet here they were, right in my face. It felt like Kurt was speaking and singing only to me, just as it had for the millions of others who so cherished this album.
Scathingly personal and heartbreaking in its intimacy, each song off the album is heard for what it is. No distortion pedals or raging drums obscure the meaning in every lyric and riff — even Novoselic’s bass is acoustic. Instead, the music is inescapably present. It’s in your face, not because of its rage or volume, but precisely because of the lack of it. There’s nothing to listen to but music in its purest form. Even “Come As You Are,” the only real mainstream hit to receive the “Unplugged” treatment, cut deeper as Cobain’s vocals broke under the weight of each lyric. On “Pennyroyal Tea,” Cobain sings about the desire to “distill the life that’s inside of me,” and there is no choice but to believe him. “The finest day that I ever had / Was when I learned to cry on command,” he sings in “On A Plain,” his performance so bare that he has no way to hide.
Tragically, with 25 years of “Unplugged” also comes the 25th anniversary of Kurt Cobain’s death. The live performance — its stage draped in heavy fabric, white lillies, and black candles — is a testament to this fact. Those close to the show’s production claimed the funerary style was Cobain’s vision. Though many percieved the performance to be almost like Cobain’s distinct brand of suicide note, it was so much more. It marked the end of Nirvana as an active, recording band but, more than that, it made them immortal. The album speaks to everyone: to those who grew up on Nirvana-soaked airwaves in the ‘90s to those who discovered the band only after the fact. Nirvana, on “Unplugged,” is nothing short of infinite.

The title of HBO’s new comedy “Mrs. Fletcher” sounds like something fit for a “Downton Abbey” spin-off. In fact, it’s a series that dives into a single mother and empty nester’s rediscovery of identity thanks to the catalyst of graphic, online porn — not exactly as buttoned-up and proper as its innocent name might suggest. Based on Tom Perrotta’s 2017 best-selling novel, “Mrs. Fletcher” stars the beloved and versatile comedian Kathryn Hahn as its initially disillusioned protagonist Eve throughout its seven installments. In a way, the contrast between the show’s sexually-charged premise and unassuming title also applies to the vibe of the pilot versus the marketed arch of the show as a whole: While the trailer teases a storyline of personal growth and struggle through the lens of sex, the pilot fails to strongly introduce this concept in its 30-minute runtime and instead falls flat in spite of Hahn’s already impressive performance. While HBO’s strong marketing campaign for this new series, as well as its talented lead actress, make “Mrs. Fletcher” still one to keep on the radar, the first episode lacks a clear establishment of tone and enough compelling, sympathetic characters to make for a memorable television pilot.
It is important to note up front that the rather slow pace and generally dreariness of Episode One might have been an intentional choice by writer of the book and screenwriter of the episode Perrotta: Perhaps to contrast with more exciting moments that will likely hit both Eve and her son Brendan’s lives going forward. Even so, an artistic decision regarding the series as a whole is all for naught if the pilot is not intriguing enough to hook the audience and draw them back for Episode Two.
In the marketing for “Mrs. Fletcher,” it’s explicitly shown both that porn will ignite Eve’s desire to explore her sexuality and reinvent herself and that her son Brendan’s (Jackson White) rather misogynistic worldview will butt heads with the more progressive college culture he is entering. Yet these full realizations clearly have been delayed until later episodes. Without the aid of plot summaries, the first episode seems to preface a series simply about a strained mother-son relationship and the loneliness of a middle-aged woman adjusting to her empty nest, not the fascinating sexuality angle that Perrotta wants to take when looking at the common experience of sending kids off to college.
At the start of the episode, a senile old man is blasting porn in the common room of the retirement home where Eve works, and toward the end, Eve googles the word “Milf” only to slam her computer shut in disgust, yet these scenes are both played more for laughs than as legitimate establishment of any enduring theme. It is true that the pilot ends with Eve blatantly flirting with a young man during the creative writing class she has decided to take at the local community college, but this decently compelling change of character deserves much more airtime considering it was likely the most suspenseful and attention-grabbing development of the episode.
On top of that, Brendan Fletcher’s intolerable personality makes the episode somewhat painful to watch, considering he dominates about half of the screen time. He starts off as a rather stereotypical self-centered straight male who lacks respect for his mother and cannot wait to taste the freedom of college. Yet as the episode unfolds, it is further revealed that he is also quite a scummy douchebag who uses his popularity to aggressively bully others and to speak to women in the same degrading, sexist tone that seems to often characterize traditional pornography.
Of course, TV shows and movies often have hated characters (the infamous Joffrey Baratheon of “Game of Thrones” comes to mind, for example) which do not detract from the overall quality of the show, but usually they’re designated as villains and not one of the two protagonists that the audience will be closely tracking for the rest of the series.
Thankfully, Kathryn Hahn’s Eve is real and relatable as she grapples with her slump in self-confidence and the looming feeling of stagnation now that her only child will be gone. It is just a shame that her scenes must be intermixed with Brendan’s, who feels more like a satirical accumulation of all the worst frat boys to exist than like a true modern teenager.
It feels like “Mrs. Fletcher” has so much more to give and a lot more exciting ground to cover in its six remaining episodes, so it is likely a mistake to give up on it already. But at the end of the day, when it comes to evaluating television pilots, the questionable writing does not give the series the strong, well-developed legs to stand on that it appears that this tale of sexual discovery deserves.

Kesha is reborn again. The artist first departed from her signature electro-pop style on her redemptive 2017 album “Rainbow.” Its tracks ranged from power ballads to bouncy anthems and even a Dolly Parton style country track — complete with a feature from the country legend herself. Signaling this change, Kesha changed her name from the stylized “Ke$ha” to the more authentic (and less ostentatious) “Kesha,” which reflected her journey to reclaim her voice and create music that is distinctively hers. Her new single, the first from her forthcoming album, “High Road,” blends the newer sound of “Rainbow” with the party music of her past to create a uniquely “Kesha” electro-pop anthem. In spite of its underlying beat, “Raising Hell” is more melody driven — keeping to the newer sound introduced in “Rainbow.”
The song begins with a slow piano progression overlaid by a soulful vocal riff, implying the impetus of a song reminiscent of the iconic ballad “Praying.” The voice of Big Freedia, queen of bounce music, breaks this opening and ushers in the beat-driven tone of the rest of the song.
The song, like its name suggests, invokes religious language and twists it to relate the message of “raising hell.” The first word, set to the beginning of an electronic beat is “Hallelujah.” In the chorus Kesha sings the titular line, perfectly summing up the message of the song: “I don’t wanna go to heaven without raisin’ hell.” This line is immediately followed by a post-chorus breakdown featuring Big Freedia singing, “drop it down low, hit it, hit the floor with it,” over a party-style beat, mixed with synthetic horns and electronic drum.
That piano motif at the onset of the song persists, underlying the harder-hitting beats of the dance-anthem. That is, until an interlude of the song ushers in a church organ, further amplifying the religious connotations of the song. Amidst the religious references, her voice itself seems to mimic that of a gospel choir. At the end of the interlude, Kesha reaches for a note, coupled with underlying harmonies, that invokes the sound of a hymn.
The outro, set to the intense beats and the recurring piano melody, again references religious iconography and language. Kesha asks, “Can I get an amen? / This is for the misfits of creation./ Take this as your holy validation./ You don’t need to hide your celebratin’ / This is our salvation.” The message of this song seems to be in diametric opposition to that of “Praying.” Kesha manipulates the perception of religion as pure and sanctified, urging listeners to raise some hell and have fun.
Kesha is back to writing party jams, but this time it’s on her own terms.

On Oct. 29, Omar Apollo tweeted “new song tomorrow,” preparing fans for a new single from the artist just days after his late-night television debut on Late Night with Seth Meyers. On Oct. 30, Apollo dropped a surprise track titled “Frío.” While exceedingly distinct from his prior projects and singles, “Frío” toe-dips into a new sound without sacrificing Apollo’s tangible familiarity.
The sound of reggaeton is so inescapable in mainstream music that Omar Apollo could not resist manifesting his own interpretation of the popular genre through this song. Produced by Kenny Beats, who is known for collaborating with artists including Rico Nasty and Vince Staples, the single features the iconic “dembow” percussive backbone found in most reggaeton music. The song starts with a cool, atmospheric synth accompanied by a set of lo-fi, heartbeat-like thuds. The sounds evoke the sensation of being trapped underneath a glacier with the wind howling in the background. The barren, frosty feeling of such a setting outlines how Apollo’s relationship has left him bitter and alone.
As is the case with much of his discography, the lyrics themselves speak of an unhealthy relationship he finds himself stuck in. Apollo expresses how, despite his wishes to abandon the toxic relationship, his significant other refuses to make it easy for him to do so. Omar’s chant of “Y no puedo amarte / De vuelta” is bound to resonate with the lovesick fan base that will flock to his upcoming national tour. His lyrics strike a precarious, but effective, balance between sincerity and commercial appeal.
Catchy break-up songs are a dime-a-dozen, but what makes this track significant is that Apollo chooses to recite the entirety of the song in Spanish — a departure from his previous, bilingual tracks. Given that this is Apollo’s first exclusively Spanish song, it could be speculated that he is choosing to tap more into his Mexican-American heritage as a source of musical inspiration. While it may be difficult for fans to part with Apollo’s style to date, his foray into reggaeton on “Frío” is a welcome indication of his commitment to artistic evolution.

What do Panic! At the Disco, Cyndi Lauper, T.I., and David Bowie all have in common? These drastically different artists all contributed their musical talents to “The Spongebob Musical.” After debuting in Chicago in 2016 and spending less than a year on Broadway, this family-friendly musical based on the Nickelodeon classic is now on a nationwide tour. From Oct. 15 through Oct. 27, the brand new tour cast of the twelve-time Tony-nominated musical took to the stage at the Boch Center and reminded audiences why Spongebob Squarepants is loved across generations.
Those who did not get to see “The Spongebob Musical” during its time in Chicago or its short residency at the Palace Theatre in New York did not have the chance to witness Ethan Slater’s Tony-nominated performance of the titular main character. Slater truly made the show — there is no “The Spongebob Musical” without him. But his staunch fans would be proven wrong if they saw Lorenzo Pugliese’s take on the role in this season’s tour. Pugliese’s Spongebob embodies every aspect of the endearing talking sea sponge that fans of both the television series and the musical’s original cast know and love. Pugliese not only has a vocal range that one would never expect from the original cartoon character, but somehow also the physicality and stamina of, well, a cartoon character. At various points of the show, Pugliese climbed moving set pieces, jumped around the stage, ran in place, and danced intricate choreography, all while maintaining Spongebob’s well-known, nasally intonation. Pugliese’s carefully crafted take on such an iconic character was both recognizable and refreshingly unique.
Along with its spot-on portrayal of Spongebob, the show featured on-stage relationships between the other characters in the musical that stayed true to those of the original series. Pugliese’s Spongebob and Beau Bradshaw’s Patrick had the most enviable friendship, exemplified by their performance of the song “BFF” written by the Plain White T’s. Spongebob’s rap battle against Plankton, played by Tristan McIntyre, what could have been risky take on the characters’ familiar rivalry, was bold, hilarious, and still showcased the two characters’ well-known personalities. Pearl Krabs’s (Méami Maszewski) teenage angst and disdain for her father’s, Eugene Krabs (Zach Kononov), obsession with money comes across perfectly in the father-daughter duet “Daddy Knows Best.” Sandy Cheeks’ (Daria Pilar Redus) love of science, expertise in karate, and general badassery came out in “Hero is My Middle Name” and “Chop to the Top.” Squidward Tentacles’s (Cody Cooley) sung soliloquy, “I’m Not a Loser,” incorporates all of the drama, self-pity, intense choreography, and clarinet solos expected of the bitter squid.
What makes “The Spongebob Musical” stand out from most shows is not the almost random collection of artists that wrote its music, the perfect, new takes on beloved cartoon characters, or even Squidward’s four-legged, complicated tap routine; it is the ensemble of the show. The ensemble of this musical is proof that without those in the background, shows simply cannot go on. The ensemble of “The Spongebob Musical” accurately depicted classic supporting characters from the television series such as Old Man Jenkins, Mrs. Puff, and Larry the Lobster, smoothly moved set pieces as the main characters climbed around on them, flawlessly executed Squidward’s tap routine as his backup dancers, and successfully brought the town of Bikini Bottom to life — all while emoting, singing, ad-libbing, and staying in character.
This live-action, musical adaptation breathes new life into “Spongebob Squarepants” with exclusive additions that differentiate the musical from the series. Components like Patrick’s gospel song and the unexpected sexual tension between Plankton and his computer wife Karen (Caitlin Ort) are specific to the musical and give fans of the original show something to enjoy that they cannot get from their television screens. The fresh yet accurate depictions of characters from one of the most culturally-impactful television shows of the 2000’s and the ensemble’s every move in the performance are proof of the clear attention to detail on the part of both the creators and performers. From the sound technician at the back of the stage imitating Spongebob’s squeaky shoes to the familiar flower clouds hanging above the stage no detail was small enough to be overlooked. Even some of the show’s most memorable jokes (“No, Patrick, mayonnaise is still not an instrument”) made the cut. “The Spongebob Musical” incorporates aspects of “Spongebob Squarepants” that those who grew up watching the show would appreciate such as not-so subtle innuendos, quotes from iconic episodes, and recognizable supporting characters even a whole Patchy the Pirate subplot. Every component of “The Spongebob Musical” was carefully and successfully crafted in order to immerse the audience in the lives of their favorite underwater sea-sponge and his friends for “the best day ever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week I finally got around to finding the answer to a question I’ve been asking of Harvard since freshman year. What are those rocks outside the Science Center and why are they always being watered?
I’ve long found them completely ridiculous. Isn’t this a waste of water? Do other people find these mossy rocks pleasant to look at? And most of all: Why do they smell so bad?
I can’t pinpoint exactly why I decided to look them up last week, as opposed to any day in the past two years, but it was a pivotal moment. When I found the answer, which was not at all what I’d expected, I ran around telling all my blockmates and still had so much leftover feeling that I sat down to write an op-ed.
By starting on Google, naturally, I learned that those smelly wet rocks in between the Science Center building and plaza actually comprise a sculpture called Tanner Fountain.
Tanner Fountain is no ordinary fountain — it is an award-winning, innovative pioneer of the “Landscape as Art” movement. When it won the 2008 Landmark Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the jury described the fountain as: “Transformational. It lives in your memory.”
Commissioned in the 1980s by then University President Derek C. Bok, Tanner Fountain sprays mist for three seasons of the year and emits steam in the winter. It consists of 32 nozzles surrounded by 159 boulders arranged in concentric but irregular rings. These boulders, cleared from regional farms, are a testament to the trials and tribulations of the first settlers to New England. Tanner’s design is a technical innovation because it is a fountain without a basin — it relies on natural gradation to allow water drainage and thus minimizes maintenance hassles, a problem Bok had found with other campus fountains.
It appears many people love that Tanner was “designed to be inhabited” and to “invit[e] human participation,” as its creators intended. The emanating water creates a “seasonal contemplative landscape,” according to the Cultural Landscape Foundation. Its simplicity “draw[s] passerby into its inner circle,” according to Garden Design magazine. The American Society of Landscape Architect’s guide to Boston argues that it may appear “enigmatic among these dignified landmarks” at first, but is then recognized as what it really is, a “relaxed oasis in the midst of august historic surroundings.”
The sculpture may have even more symbolic meaning at Harvard. Tanner’s designer argued, “The fountain is a minimal piece full of contradictions…the materials, their perception and their various meanings are brought into conflict and into question. This artistic statement may be apropos to the questioning stance of students and the intellectual inquiry of the university.”
Why am I writing about this? When I first headed down the rabbit hole, I thought I’d find a funny story about yet another example of Harvard eccentricity and mild ineptitude. I knew those rocks had to be put there by someone, and it felt reasonable enough that Harvard would have done the unreasonable thing of dumping some rocks there for some sort of decoration.
On one hand, my confusion and fascination have only grown. I barely recognized the sculpture as art, and I have never felt the slightest inclination to “participate” in it (despite the many provided examples of student activities, which range from the banal, like reading and conversing, to the less plausible, at least for me, including meditating and flirting).
But my overwhelming feeling is one of regret: For all the disproportionate amount of time I’ve spent thinking and talking about these rocks, why didn’t I look up their origin earlier?
I suppose I didn’t think I’d find an answer, but I’m disappointed for letting that discourage me for two years. We schedule a lot of our learning in weekly blocks. Going to my scheduled learning is the main reason I’ve found myself walking past the rocks to begin with. Despite all that scheduled time, however, it feels like a shame to miss out on learning for learning’s sake.
This feeling of time being divided into before and after you learned something, of you being divided in the person before and after you learned that thing — it’s all too easy to wax poetic about this feeling in interviews on demand. An unfortunately important thing one happens to learn in college, though not in those scheduled learning blocks, is to craft neat narratives about the project, the class, the job that creates a eureka moment, suddenly making clear one’s future calling.
And so I appreciated the inadvertent reminder I gave myself that this type of eureka moment is much more satisfying when it comes from silly little personal quests. I do not know if anyone else cares about these rocks in the slightest, nor will I do anything useful in a concrete sense with the information I’ve learned, but that is both irrelevant and the entire point.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The NCAA announced last week it would finally allow athletes to receive compensation for their names, images, and likenesses. While NCAA member institutions have historically profited enormously from athletic programs, students — whose time and labor lies at the core of any successful program — haven’t made a cent. Under this new decision, which top officials unanimously agreed on, some student athletes — perhaps five percent of top-tier athletic universities, according to one expert’s estimate — could begin to profit off their effort.
For us, this move is a no-brainer, and a late one at that. Profiting from one’s own image seems to us a basic economic right, and status as a student-athlete does not seem sufficient to deny it. This is especially true given how universities have made such enormous profits from their athletics programs; for example, the Texas Longhorn program at University of Texas at Austin made over $200 million in 2018 alone. Still, we feel it necessary to identify some significant concerns this decision poses, both nationally and at Harvard.
At the national level, the decision’s rollout, insofar as it might seem to address the broad exploitation of student athletes, seems dubious. Will students get a cut of university revenues dependent upon their image? Or will they have to make individual contracts with outside entities and vendors? What institutional support will be provided to students as they navigate this process? And how will the new system be regulated and enforced, particularly across divisions and schools?
It also seems as if only a select minority of student athletes will likely benefit. Cases like that of Zion Williamson, a Duke basketball star who in his single year of college play could have stood to make $2.5 million, are not representative of the situation most student athletes will face. Those who do make anything, mostly hometown stars, could make somewhere in the low five figures. But the reality is that most students, despite their extensive labor, skill, and prowess, don't stand to make much of anything at all.
But what might concern top-tier athletic institutions across the nation doesn’t really apply to Harvard at all. Harvard’s athletic program does not necessarily exploit student labor in the same way it seems to at other schools. But as we’ve opined in the past, the athletics program appears to serve to some extent as a backdoor acceptance path for white, wealthy, and legacy applicants. It should not be surprising then that with few exceptions, like that of the great Jeremy Lin, whose brief streak of brilliance on the New York Knicks in 2012 made him a short-lived but astronomical star, many of Harvard’s homegrown athletic stars have been white men: Bobby Jones, one of the greatest golfers of all time, Ryan Fitzpatrick, a quarterback whose brilliance at Harvard didn’t quite transfer to the NFL, and Matt Birk, a punter who won the NFL Man of the Year award in 2012, just to name a few.
At Harvard, therefore, conceptualizing this new NCAA decision as a move toward social justice is not so simple. The decision is far from a bad one, but the distribution of its potential benefits on our campus will look different than they will at that other Crimson athletic program: the University of Alabama. While we celebrate this historic move on the NCAA’s part, we do so with the awareness that its positive principle may not necessarily correlate to the most democratic effects.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One night in the late 1960s, perhaps around this time of year, a group of black male Harvard students left a Radcliffe College dormitory blanketed by the purple haze of an early night. As they headed back to their dorms, their walk was stopped short. A Harvard security officer asked for their IDs; in doing so, he was demanding they prove their right to exist freely on College property. But as the students began to reach for their wallets, they noticed that a group of white males had not been similarly stopped. The black students refused to show their wallets in defiance.
When I read stories like these from Martha Biondi’s “Black Revolution on Campus,” I want to believe that Harvard has outgrown the idea that belonging here requires that we look a certain way or come from a certain background.
But then, I am forced to face reality.
Last Thursday, I read an open letter to the Harvard community from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Latinx Student Association. It detailed an incident on Oct. 24 in which three women of color were setting up an art installation for a class called SPANSH 126: “Performing Latinidad” — an installation approved by the Harvard Yard Operations Office. The letter alleged it wasn’t long before the Harvard University Police Department was called; the police “approached the students with hostility” and “operated under the assumption that these were not Harvard students, and therefore subject to removal.” The students were repeatedly questioned for some time before they called on their professor to intervene, to no avail and their professor, also a woman of color, was treated as though she didn’t belong either, the letter alleges.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay commissioned a report after this event; it declared that there was no evidence of “malicious intent” on the part of the Harvard police — but this is irrelevant. What matters is how clearly the narration of the interaction, in both the police and the students’ accounts, can be situated within the history of racial profiling on college campuses. Perhaps those writing the report understood this, which is why the report recommended Harvard review its policy on how operations and security personnel interact with students.
This incident arrives on the heels of the Pilot Pulse Survey, which shows that 23 percent of community members feel as though they don’t belong at Harvard; most are students who have been pushed to the margins. In light of all this, it’s clear that Harvard’s approach to “inclusion and belonging” simply isn’t working.
This isn’t to say that Harvard’s community hasn’t improved in the last five or so decades. Efforts to include students of diverse backgrounds, as well as the belated merger of Radcliffe with Harvard College in 1999 and the founding of the BGLTQ Office in 2012, have helped lower historical barriers against minority groups. These changes are a result of years of advocacy and activism on the part of students and faculty who demanded space for themselves on campus, who asserted that they belong here too.
Harvard often responds to concerns like these with bureaucratic buzzwords: initiatives, workshops, task forces. Sometimes, these work. But other times, formal apparatuses only go so far. Harvard’s failed attempts to reduce sexual harassment and assault on campus over the past four years are a clear example of why the current framework, and the bureaucracy that sustains it, aren’t enough.
Bureaucratic changes fail for two reasons. The first is abstract — these changes aim for integration into an abstract “Harvard community” rather than reimagining what that community is. Integration doesn’t create something new. More often than not, it attempts to fit people into a broken system. The reforms pursued under this idea of inclusion and belonging requires students of marginalized backgrounds to assimilate to the culture that Harvard has always had: one that has historically excluded those same groups through the same cultures of belonging.
Harvard has also stated that change should focus primarily on academic and professional instead of “social problems,” failing to recognize that social contexts are where these problems originate and take root. When proposed solutions neglect the social fabric of an institution, they silence the possibility of transformative cultural change.
The second reason bureaucratic changes fail is more practical. When these solutions develop within the existing framework of the university, they almost never cater to student concerns or needs. Take the Culture Lab Innovation Fund, which imprudently combines the principles of a start-up incubator with the goals of social justice. The fund asks members of the community to pitch ideas that will improve inclusion and belonging in exchange for the chance to win up to $15,000 for their project. While well-intentioned, most projects that emerge are surface-level bandages that are ill-suited to solve deep-rooted historical problems.
If Harvard is truly dedicated to inclusion and belonging, it needs to radically reorient its approach. Some reforms will be bureaucratic or procedural, like creating workshops that address racial or intersectional literacy or expanding the First-Year Retreat and Experience pre-orientation program; others require a deeper commitment to inclusion, like the creation of a multicultural center. These actions, while more difficult, would demonstrate strong commitments to real, substantive methods of inclusion. They would show that Harvard doesn’t want to just fit people into a system built on historical exclusion — rather, they want to build a new system from the ground up.
Finally, the Harvard administration cannot begin to understand what it feels like to have to prove that you belong here until they speak to those that have done so — students like the three women of color setting up an art installation for a class on identity. Only through earnest conversations like these can we truly “create” a culture that includes everyone at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services has started offering same-day appointments for non-urgent cases, according to a social media post made by Student Mental Health Liaisons last week.
Under this initiative — a pilot program — students can book an appointment by calling the front desk beginning at 8:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday. Appointments are made on a first-come, first-served basis.
Unlike traditional CAMHS appointments, the new same-day appointments are set aside for students who are not already seeing a counselor at CAMHS or who would like help solving a problem in the moment, according to the CAMHS website.
Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis wrote in an emailed statement that the preparation took place over several months, and CAMHS is “thrilled” to offer same-day appointments.
“As demand substantially increases, we continually look for new, innovative ways to deliver quality services to our students,” Lewis wrote. “We recognize that many students want more direct engagement with counselors, oftentimes as a thought partner in problem-solving more immediate issues.”
The new program comes after criticism from students who have alleged that the mental health service imposed unreasonable wait times on Harvard affiliates who tried to see counselors. Before launching same-day appointments, CAMHS had tried to respond to these criticisms by creating Let’s Talk — an informal drop-in program with counselors around campus — and using iHope, an online therapy program.
CAMHS has also faced criticism for the size and makeup of its staff. Some students have lobbied for more counselors of color and providers from more socioeconomically diverse backgrounds. Over the past year, CAMHS has hired eight additional counselors, some of whom specialize in treatment for students from underrepresented backgrounds.
Lewis wrote in an email that the new same-day bookings will serve different purposes than existing CAMHS appointments.
“Same day appointments are different from traditional appointments in that they are 30-minute standalone appointments for non-urgent matters,” Lewis wrote. “While there are no follow-up appointments, a student can return for same-day appointments in the future.”
If students are experiencing mental health emergencies, they will be referred to Urgent Care instead, according to the CAMHS website.
Student Mental Health Liaison Kathryn S. Boit ’22 said that while SMHLs did not take part in creating this project, it is part of their responsibility as SMHLs to spread awareness for resources.
“A lot of us are really happy to see that this is being implemented, but we had no part in creating this or reorganizing their staff for this,” she said. “It’s really just like our purpose as SMHLs is to educate — you know — and spread awareness for resources.”
Boit said she is excited to see how walk-in appointments work for students.
“I’m really excited to see how it goes,” Boit said. “This is being piloted for this semester and next semester so I’m hoping it has a good turnout.”
Lewis wrote that she hopes students can address their concerns during these same-day appointments.
“By the end of their same-day appointment, we hope the student feels they have had the opportunity to share and discuss any concern, acquires new problem-solving tools, and deepens their understanding of available resources both inside and outside of CAMHS,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two referenda reached the requisite number of student signatures to appear on the ballot during the Undergraduate Council’s upcoming presidential election, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Conner P. Williams ’21.
Environmental advocacy group Divest Harvard submitted one referendum, calling on the University to disclose its holdings in the fossil fuels industry, commit to divesting its endowment from fossil fuels, and reinvest more sustainably by Earth Day 2020. Lucas Chu ’23 submitted the other referendum, which proposes to extend the closing times of breakfast and dinner by half an hour in Harvard University Dining Services facilities.
Referenda can appear on UC ballots through two methods: a vote by the student body or a vote by the council. The two aforementioned referenda qualified for the ballot by receiving signatures from at least 10 percent of the student body. The council has yet to vote on whether to include other referenda on the ballot as well.
UC referenda are meant to gauge the opinion of the student body on campus issues. If a referendum receives a majority vote on the ballot, the council will write a statement supporting the result of the referendum and outlining the UC’s plan to achieve the desired policy change, according to an email from UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, a former Crimson Sports Chair.
Students have voted on fossil fuel referenda in the past. Last year, a referendum to divest from the fossil fuel industry won support from 71.5 percent of voters. In 2012, 72 percent of students voted in favor.
“In a time of unprecedented climate emergency, Harvard has a responsibility as a highly privileged institution to model climate leadership through divestment—a baseline step towards fixing broken power systems that allow institutions and individuals to profit off the destruction of the planet,” this year’s divestment referendum reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to previous statements in response to divestment.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it,” he wrote in an emailed statement.
University administrators have long argued that the University’s endowment should not be used as a tool to enact social change. Instead, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has argued Harvard must work with industry players to combat climate change.
The meal times referendum proposes extending breakfast to 10:45 a.m. and dinner to 7:45 p.m. at all HUDS facilities and increasing the pay of HUDS staff accordingly.
Chu wrote in an emailed statement that he submitted the referendum in response to concerns he heard from other students about meal times.
“For most houses, dinner closes at 7:15, which is when many, if not most, students would rather begin eating,” Chu wrote.
Students will be able to vote on the referenda from noon on Nov. 11 to noon on Nov. 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change within Harvard’s governance boards — is backing a slate of candidates for the Board of Overseers on a platform of fossil fuel divestment and ensuring younger alumni are represented on the University’s second highest governing body.
Harvard Forward launched its on-campus campaign Sunday when members sought Undergraduate Council support for its platform. The UC supported the group’s calls to reserve several seats on the Board of Overseers for recent University graduates. The group is backing that platform point by running its own set of candidates who recently graduated from schools across the University.
“We are working to elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard toward divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students,” the website reads.
Specifically, the group is calling to elect alumni who have graduated within the path four academic cycles or are on track to graduate the same year they are elected. The proposal recommends reserving three of six seats for alumni from Harvard’s graduate schools and the other three for those who attended the College.
“Greater inclusion of alumni who have recently been students themselves will broaden the range of perspectives present during the Board’s discussions, better informing the Board’s decision-making processes,” the proposal reads.
Harvard Forward declined to comment for this article.
The policy proposal also recommends holding at least three town halls each academic year with members of the Board of Overseers and requiring at least five members of the Board to attend each town hall. It also requests that the Overseers invite members of the Harvard Graduate Council and the UC’s president and vice president to a Board meeting to present on “campus affairs.”
In addition to its governance proposals, the website also urges Harvard to divest completely from fossil fuels, “bolster responsible investment practices,” and dedicate resources to research to fight climate change. The UC did not endorse this provision, but supported the town hall platform point.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “fully committed” to finding solutions to climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
“As it has done for well over a decade, the University will continue to support its faculty, students and staff as they pursue a range of innovative and ambitious efforts to accelerate the world’s transition to renewable sources of energy and to help mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change that are already being realized,” Swain wrote.
Swain also pointed to the University’s Climate Action Plan that committed the school to becoming fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050. He also noted that Harvard joined Climate Action 100+, a group of investors committed to pushing greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change initiatives.

The Harvard Graduate Council voted to formally support the Harvard Forward campaign’s proposed amendment to elect more recent alumni to the Board of Overseers at its monthly open meeting Monday.
The HGC also deliberated on crafting a statement of support for Harvard students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status — which allows undocumented youth brought to the United States as children to live and work in the country — ahead of the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments on the Trump administration’s plan to end DACA.
Harvard Forward representative Nathan Goldberg ’18 presented the campaign’s platform to the HGC. Harvard Forward is a new campaign staffed by alumni, students, and faculty seeking to push the Board of Overseers — Harvard’s second-highest governing body — to address climate change issues and readjust Harvard’s investment policies.
The Board of Overseers is a 30-person body comprised of Harvard alumni and advises administrators, approves certain actions by the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — and generally influences the school’s direction. Harvard Forward hopes to elect more recent alumni to the group.
“The average overseer graduated from Harvard 28 years ago. Think about the conversations we’ve had since then,” Goldberg said. “We’re trying to address the symptoms of Harvard’s attitude toward climate change and the causes, so that whatever attitudes are 30 years from now, seats will be built in for recent alumni to represent current concerns.”
The HGC voted unanimously to support Harvard Forward’s proposal, which includes three parts. The first part reserves six of the 30 Overseers seats for alumni who have graduated in the last four years. The second part institutes regular town halls where students can speak directly to the Overseers, and the third part ensures that the HGC and the Undergraduate Council would have semesterly meetings with the Overseers.
“We are advocating for a more broad and holistic restructuring of how we think about responsible investing and responsible fundraising in a way that is very transparent, which is not what we have today,” Goldberg said.
The UC voted in favor of the same governance proposal at their weekly meeting Sunday.
Harvard Medical School student Alma J. Oñate Munoz, who has held DACA status according to a Harvard Medical School article about undocumented students at the school, also presented at the meeting on behalf of undocumented students in the graduate schools and at the College.
Oñate Munoz informed the HGC that next Tuesday the Supreme Court will be hearing a case which will determine the future legality of DACA. She urged the HGC to ask graduate students to attend immigration advocacy group Harvard College Act On a Dream’s rally on Nov. 11 ahead of the oral arguments.
“Essentially the future of about 800,000 young people in this nation is at stake,” Oñate Munoz said. “We’re hoping to get support from across the graduate schools to show the support we have for our peers, our family members, whoever it might be that you know or don’t know who will be impacted by this decision.”
At the conclusion of the HGC’s meeting, interim-Council member and founder of the HGC’s External Action Committee Kelly E. Menjivar Ramirez proposed that at the next HGC meeting the Council vote to issue a statement in support of undocumented students on campus.
“We made an admissions statement two years ago. I think it would be helpful as a student council to re-issue a statement in support of DACA,” Menjivar Ramirez said.

Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in an interview on Friday that he hopes to help members of his division develop and improve their General Education offerings in the coming year.
The revamped Gen Ed program premiered this fall with dozens of new and adapted courses designed to transcend both disciplinary divisions and the bounds of the classroom, per its website. Despite delays in its rollout, many of the courses offered this fall proved immensely popular even though the Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed enrollment caps on many.
“Focusing on urgent problems and enduring questions, Gen Ed courses are unusually explicit in connecting the subjects you study to the people you will become and the world beyond the classroom,” the program’s site reads.
Stubbs said that members of the Sciences Division have work left to do in developing Gen Ed offerings that fully embrace the mission of the new program.
“The challenge that I hope to address for Gen Ed offerings from Science faculty is that the liberal arts educational objective of Gen Ed courses is much broader than just some introductory course in chemistry,” he said. “And I think scientists in particular are often uneasy dealing with syllabus and curricular things that are not directly in their lane.”
Stubbs said that many of his colleagues have “a firm comfort zone,” so when it comes to teaching about the “broader social elements” of their work, “a lot of scientists are reluctant to go there intellectually.” He said he hopes to encourage more Sciences faculty to adopt the liberal arts mindset required for Gen Ed courses.
“[My goal is] empowering my colleagues to be more comfortable to move into that space and take some ownership and share their perspective and understand that it's okay, in the classroom as a scientist, to speak to things to which there may not be a black-and-white, crisp, quantitative, experimentally-verifiable answer,” he added.
Stubbs said he hopes to embark on this mission in the coming year with the partnership of the Gen Ed program office.
“I think that we are going to continue to improve the Gen Ed program and the offerings that we have out of this division to support the curriculum of Harvard College,” he said.
Stubbs added that he is inspired by his colleagues.
“I salute my colleagues for their creativity, scholarship and research accomplishments,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously voted — for the second time — to support Harvard’s graduate student union in its efforts to reach an agreement with Harvard, this time making its demands more urgent.
The resolution was co-sponsored by Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor Alanna M. Mallon, and Councilor E. Denise Simmons.
The vote came several weeks after Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers voted to authorize its bargaining committee to call a strike when it sees fit. Though there are no formal plans yet to strike, the union has told members it is likely to happen this semester if a final agreement is not reached.
McGovern said during the meeting that it is a “shame” the issue is still being negotiated, and that Harvard’s current graduate students’ wages are “unconscionable.”
“The city has the resources to pay close to $15 an hour. That's why we do it,” he said. “Harvard has the resources to do the same and it's important that institutions that have the financial capability to pay a living wage do so.”
The council previously passed a similar unanimous resolution in April to support union negotiations.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan also criticized the University’s approach to negotiations, specifically citing “harassment by faculty.” In recent months, HGSU and the University have been at loggerheads in negotiations over anti-harassment provisions in the contract.
“The students are asking for basic protections of their rights, and it's absolutely unacceptable for the University to refuse that,” he said. “So I agree with my colleagues that this has to happen, and we should be doing everything we can to put pressure on the University to make it happen.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain could not immediately be reached for comment Monday night.
He has previously told The Crimson that the union’s proposal would place complainants and respondents face-to-face in an “adversarial arbitration.” Swain has also said in the past that the University’s counterproposal would offer the union members seats on a committee and two working groups to review Harvard’s current policies and procedures on Title IX and “other forms of discrimination and misconduct.”
Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, a member of Harvard’s graduate student union’s bargaining committee, spoke at the meeting, arguing that the University has not addressed “serious complaints” regarding grievance procedures for misconduct.
“The University has done nothing,” she said. “Nothing to protect student workers civil rights, nothing to protect our rights to study and work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination.”
Union member Matthew R. Volpe also spoke to the council, and said the University’s power is “problematic.”
“I think it's unfortunately clear that Harvard doesn't see its graduate students as holding much power to actually influence what goes on at the University,” he said. “We're really relying on support from outside organizations, like our local government, to support us and make this happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 6, 2019 at 2:56 a.m.
Harvard’s graduate student union announced Tuesday morning that it will strike if negotiations are unable to reach a contract with the University by Dec. 3.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers informed their members of the impending deadline in an email Tuesday morning. The union informed the University of its “strong mandate” to finalize a contract this semester during a bargaining session Oct. 30, according to the email.
“We on the bargaining committee, working together with department leaders from across campus, have set a strike deadline for December 3rd,” the email reads. “If the Administration does not bargain a fair agreement by that time, we will go out on strike.”
December 3 is the final day of classes for the fall semester, which means a potential strike would occur during reading and finals period.
The bargaining committee’s email highlighted that it still seeks to avoid a strike.
“The Bargaining Committee will continue to negotiate this month and will do all it can to avert a strike, but the administration must negotiate towards a fair agreement to avoid a strike,” the committee wrote.
Union negotiators declined to comment for this story.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the announcement was “disappointing.”
"HGSU-UAW is making a choice to potentially disrupt the academic work of all Harvard students as they wrap up the semester, which is disappointing,” Swain wrote. “The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and feels a strike is unwarranted.”
“We will work across the University to prepare for a strike and make every attempt to reduce negative impact on students as they are wrapping up the semester's academic work and preparing for and taking their finals,” he added.
HGSU and the University will meet for bargaining sessions Nov. 15, 22, and 26, according to Swain.
Student teaching staff who strike will not offer instruction of any type, including teaching classes, sections, review sessions, and office hours, according to a strike guide released by HGSU. They will also stop grading papers, exams, and assignments for the duration of the strike.
Graduate research assistants who strike will also withhold 20 hours of paid research work per week, per the guide. These students, however, will not withhold the work that contributes to their own academic programs.
The bargaining committee’s email encouraged members to begin preparing for a potential strike by speaking with their students and faculty members. It also recommended members join the picket line if a strike takes place.
“In order to have strong, visible picket lines, it will be important to spend as close as possible to 20 hours on the line in lieu of working,” the email said.
At least 95 faculty members have also signed an open letter pledging that they will not retaliate against striking student workers.
Associate Provost Doreen Koretz and University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email to faculty Oct. 15 — ahead of a vote to authorize the bargaining committee to call a strike — that it is “critical” that faculty plan for how they would continue running courses in the event of a strike.
HGSU represents roughly 5,000 graduate research assistants and student teaching staff at the University. More than 90 percent of the students who voted in a strike authorization vote last month supported strike authorization.
Tuesday’s announcement came days after the union held two town halls to update its members on the status of negotiations and make recommendations to student workers on how to navigate teaching and research responsibilities if a strike were to occur.
HGSU and the University have remained at an impasse over several key issues in the more than year-old contract negotiations, including compensation, health insurance, and a grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.

Although last season ended in heartbreaking fashion for Harvard, this season will offer the team a fresh start.
The team’s competitive play throughout the season, which garnered the squad third place in the league, was belied by a nearly thirty-point loss to Ancient Eight rival Penn in the semifinals of the Ivy League Tournament last March.
At the time, coach Kathy Delaney-Smith described the game as “probably one of the most disappointing games I can remember in the past 37 years.”
Indeed, the rout came as a shock to Delaney-Smith and her team. During the regular season, the Crimson and the Quakers proved even match-ups. Their first contest resulted in a double overtime victory for Harvard at Lavietes Pavilion. At the Palestra in Philadelphia, Penn surmounted the Crimson in overtime.
But with a new season comes a blank slate.
“It's behind me. Once it's over, it's over and we move forward,” Delaney-Smith said.
Though the Quakers and Princeton are perennial conference power houses and defending co-champions, Delaney-Smith emphasized the importance of every league game in a conference that is often highly competitive from the first seed to the eighth.
“I think every Ivy League game is close,” said the 38-season skipper for the Crimson. “We sort of take every Ivy League game the same...in any given night, anyone could beat anyone.”
For better or worse, the Harvard team that will step onto the hardwood this week in its first matchup of the 2019-2020 season does not share much in common with last year’s team.
Indeed, three out of the four top scorers from last season — all guards — will not return to the Crimson this year. They include graduates and co-captains Sydney Skinner ‘19 and 1000-point scorer Madeline Raster ‘19.
Conspicuously absent from this season’s roster is senior point guard Katie Benzan. The Wellesley, Mass. native, who led Harvard in points and assists for the past three consecutive seasons, announced that she will forgo her senior year season with the Crimson to maintain eligibility to play a post-grad year for the University of Texas at Austin.
“I'm sorry that was a choice Katie made, but she feels it's the best thing for her and we're moving forward pretty nicely,” Delaney-Smith commented.
A Heavy-Lifting Freshman Class
Much of Delaney-Smith’s optimism stems from a precocious and talented freshman class of guards.
“I think [Benzan] was a prolific scorer and a tremendous shooter, but our freshman class is loaded,” Delaney-Smith said. “This may be one of the strongest freshman classes I've ever had. I couldn't be more pleased with their work ethic and their ability to learn the system.”
The Crimson coach exalted two stand-out rookies: guards Annie Stritzel and Lola Mullaney.
Delaney-Smith described Stritzel, a 5-10 guard who is the all-time leading scorer for her high school Nazareth Academy in Chicago, as “a bull in a china shop.”
“She just finds a way to get things done and you don’t even know how,” she said. “You look at the stat sheet and she’s leading everybody in all of the stats.”
Stritzel’s classmate, Mullaney, has also impressed Delaney-Smith. A 5-11 guard from Colts Neck, New Jersey, Mullaney scored 1500 points during her high school career.
“She may be the best shooter to ever play here if she continues the way she's going right now,” Delaney-Smith offered.
Other first year guards who will contribute to Harvard’s team include Gabby Donaldson, a Raleigh, North Carolina native who scored 1000 points in high school.
First-year 5-9 guard Sara Park, who shattered records at her high school in McLean, Va., will bring her talents to the Crimson this season. At The Potomac School, Park set all-time program highs in career points, triples, and points in a single game.
A torn ACL will sideline first year guard Gracie Martin. The 6-1 guard, who hails from Biddeford, Maine, was named to the McDonald’s All-Academic Team and All-Star Team in 2018-19.
The newest addition to the roster is 5-11 guard Naomi-Grace Jennings, who walked onto Harvard’s team this season.
Larger Roles for Returning Players
The talented first-years will support the performances of returning players, who will take on larger roles this season. Junior forward Jadyn Bush, who led the Crimson in rebounds last season, will likely suit up in the starting lineup for Harvard once again. The Federal Way, Wash. native averaged 8.5 boards per game last season and led the returning class in scoring with 10.9 points per game.
The junior will be flanked in the post with senior forward Jeannie Boehm, who averaged close to 30 minutes per game last season. In her penultimate season, Boehm contributed 8.2 points and 7.3 rebounds per game.
In addition to being an offensive threat, the forward sees her role this season in a leadership capacity through supporting younger players.
“Something I'm looking for from a leadership perspective is [using] my experience and seniority to help us win and [to] do whatever I can to help us win,” she said.
The team is captained by junior forward Rachel Levy and senior guard Mackenzie Barta. Coming off the bench, Levy delivered crucial buckets for the Crimson last season, evincing a smooth mid-range jumper.
Delaney-Smith also expects sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy and sophomore forward Tess Sussman to offer larger contributions to the team this season. The duo each averaged under ten minutes of playing time per game last season but will both start for Harvard this season, according to Delaney-Smith.
The winningest coach in the Ivy League noted that her team’s inexperience was its greatest liability.
“We have plenty of scorers,” she said. “What we lack is experience. It remains to be seen whether that hurts us or not.”
First Tip
The Crimson’s first test will take place in the Midwest on Tuesday in a 11 a.m. eastern-time tip off against the Northern Illinois Huskies, who play in the Mid-American Conference.
Delaney-Smith suggested that the Harvard squad may appear a “little behind” in its first contest of the season due to off-season surgeries and preseason injuries. Nonetheless, she said she felt “optimistic” and maintained that “we have the ability to win.”
The Crimson will make it back to Cambridge to host University of California, Berkeley — who Harvard topped 85-79 last season — in a Friday night showdown that tips off at 7 p.m.

In some ways, the seniors have fulfilled all of the expectations that were placed on the group, which 247 Sports’ Composite Team Rankings regarded as the 25th-best recruiting class in the nation. They have won at least a share of the Ivy League title in consecutive years and last season advanced to the second round of the NIT for the first time in program history.
But one achievement is missing: an NCAA Tournament appearance.
Last year’s team was the first in Tommy Amaker’s 11-year Crimson career that was totally devoid of NCAA Tournament experience — this year’s team is the second.
That said, everything seems lined up for the Crimson to end that drought and find itself in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015. Harvard returns 96.4 percent of its minutes and 96.7 percent of its scoring from a year ago, second and third most in the country, respectively.
It should also eventually get 2017-18 Ivy League Player of the Year, Seth Towns, back from an injury that kept him out all of last season.
And unlike the last two years, when top-seeded Crimson teams had to face Penn and Yale in the finals of the Ivy League Tournament at Penn and Yale, Harvard will have home-court advantage should it reach the Ivy League postseason this time around.
With a healthy, seasoned roster and a friendly tournament atmosphere, the heralded 2016 recruiting class could be poised to end its Crimson career on a high note.
The Returning Roster
Towns’s eventual return — the team remains silent about his timetable — will boost a squad that already had a lot of depth. Scrappy senior point guard Bryce Aiken, a unanimous All-Ivy first team selection and the league’s leading scorer with north of 22 points per game last season, will lead the ranks with Towns. Aiken battled injuries for the second consecutive season, missing most of the non-conference slate and suiting up for 18 games after playing 14 the season before, but he showed his talent and his mettle in league play, consistently taking over games down the stretch.
Without Towns, Harvard did not have a second natural go-to scorer on its roster, and Aiken ably shouldered more of the load. He was responsible for Harvard’s signature moment last season, a double-clutch three-pointer against Columbia to send the game into double-overtime before the Crimson eventually won. The shot was the top play on SportsCenter and accounted for three of Aiken’s career-high 44 points, the second-most in school history.
The Randolph, N.J., native then hit a game-tying triple against Penn the following weekend and a game-winner against Yale a weekend after that before pouring in 38 points in the Ivy League Tournament final. Aiken tested the NBA draft waters after the season, a sign of the extent to which the former four-star recruit has improved, before opting to come back to school for his senior season.
Harvard should get Towns back at some point this year, and it will be interesting to see how the former Ivy League Player of the Year fits into the lineup next to Aiken. Two seasons ago, playing the forward position, Towns led the team in scoring and finished just a few ticks behind classmate Justin Bassey for the team lead in rebounding. With Cornell’s Matt Morgan having graduated, and Yale’s Miye Oni in the NBA, Aiken and Towns, along with Penn’s A.J. Brodeur, could finish at the top of the Ivy League scoring charts.
The rest of last year’s core also returns. Bassey, a do-it-all forward and often the team’s defensive stopper, has been the Crimson’s most consistent player over the last three years. He’s averaged upwards of 27 minutes per game each season and is in line for a hefty amount of playing time this year too. While he is not flashy, Bassey contributes hustle plays that do not always appear on the scoresheet. He has led Harvard in rebounds for two straight years while also adding a couple of assists and a steal or so per contest. No matter how Tommy Amaker chooses to sort out his rotation — and he has a multitude of options — Bassey, because of his versatility and role-player prowess, seems set to be a big part of Amaker’s plans.
In addition to the star power of Towns and Aiken and the heart-and-soul of Bassey, it is clear that the Crimson does not lack quality returning wing pieces. In the absence of Towns last year, then-freshman Noah Kirkwood grew into a key role off of the bench at first before later becoming a starter and often Harvard’s second-most dangerous offensive weapon. Kirkwood was the only player not named Bryce Aiken to crack double figures in the Ivy League Tournament final, and he went on to finish second on the team with 30 points in the Crimson’s two NIT games. While Kirkwood sometimes looked like the first-year he was — in particular, he spoke last season about improving his body language after a call goes against him — the broad-shouldered combo guard showed an ability to create his own buckets and also chipped in on the boards, finishing third on the team in rebounds.
Also back are senior point guard Christian Juzang and senior forward Chris Lewis, both of whom started regularly for most of last season. While some may have thought that the return of Aiken last season would have sent Juzang to the bench, the steady ball-handler started all but two Ivy League games and played at least 20 minutes in every single league game. Juzang will look to serve as the lead guard that Amaker trusts most after Aiken, and his ability to knock down three-pointers at a 36% rate should prove to be a valuable asset. While he might not start all season again, with the emergence of Kirkwood and the return of Towns, Juzang will remain part of the rotation. 
Like Juzang, Lewis is a reliable option whose spot in the rotation seems assured. After earning an All-Ivy first team selection in his sophomore season, he shot better than 60% from the field for the third straight year and remains an excellent post player. Shooting 12-of-15 against Georgetown and NC State (both power conference teams) in the NIT should also boost his confidence.
While juniors Danilo Djuricic and Rio Haskett will likely have far bigger roles next season, by the time the 2016 recruiting class will have graduated, they will both have been regular members of Amaker’s rotation for two years. Djuricic received an uptick in minutes late in the season, while Haskett scored in double figures just twice all season but remains a sparkplug who can get hot in a hurry off the bench.
Senior bigs Robert Baker and Henry Welsh offer Amaker two very different options to play instead of — or alongside — Lewis. Baker has flashed the potential of a dangerous stretch-five, with the bounce to be a proficient shot-blocker and the skill to hit 36% of his threes, fly by slower defenders, and hammer home monster dunks. Welsh, meanwhile, plays a more traditional big man position who chips in on the boards and can, on occasion, punish smaller defenders.
Kirkwood was the most productive of last season’s first-years, but he wasn’t the only to receive important minutes. In fact, forward Kale Catchings went from being unused for most of the season to starting four of the last five regular season matchups and both Ivy League Tournament games, showing off his explosiveness and soft touch from beyond the arc. Given the roster depth of a talented group of sophomores like Catchings, Mason Forbes, and Spencer Freedman, deciding how to distribute minutes between the players will present a challenge for Amaker and his coaching staff.
The Freshmen
The Crimson will again add what can be considered the Ivy League’s top recruiting class and its best since 2016 — a class that ranks 38th nationally per 247 Sports. While the crowded roster will make cracking the lineup difficult for first-year players, at least one freshman has broken into Amaker’s rotation in each of the last few seasons, so it is well worth considering the possibility that the same might happen this year.
Chris Ledlum
The fifth ESPN Top-100 recruit to commit to the Crimson since 2016, Ledlum extends the trend of high-profile prospects joining Tommy Amaker’s program. Finishing his high school career at Northfield Mount Hermon—the same prep school that Kirkwood attended—Ledlum was named 2019 Gatorade Massachusetts Player of the Year, USA Today Massachusetts Player of the Year, as well as the 2019 NEPSAC AAA Player of the Year after leading his team to a NEPSAC championship in his final high school run. Ledlum’s explosiveness on the court and ability to guard virtually any position will make him an intriguing piece in a rotation loaded with talent and experience.
Idan Tretout
The freshman class’ second New York native, Tretout, spent his high school career playing at Wilbraham and Monson Academy in Massachusetts. He capped off his four-year, 1,600 point career at WMA earning First Team All-NEPSAC in his final season, receiving honorable mention recognition the year before. Tretout arrived on campus already having built some chemistry with Ledlum, as the two New Yorkers played together on youth teams. To go along with his high school career, Tretout played on the Under Armour Circuit with New York’s New Heights AAU team, winning the 2018 Under Armour Association championship alongside teammates Precious Achiuwa and Lester Quiñones — two members of Memphis’ number one ranked recruiting class this past year. His abilities to shoot the ball, attack the rim, and defend give him the potential to develop into the role that junior guard Rio Haskett takes on.
Ciaran Brayboy
The Glencoe, Ill. native was Harvard’s first commit from the incoming freshman class. Brayboy graduated from New Trier High School, where he earned an All-State selection in his senior year. Brayboy played in the highly competitive Nike EYBL and Under Armour Association circuits, where he faced off against some of the nation’s top prospects following his seasons with New Trier. His rugged play and aggressiveness around the rim are reminiscent of current senior Chris Lewis, as Brayboy hopes to contribute another dimension of toughness to the roster.
Luka Sakota
The trend of Canadian Crimson commits continues with Sakota, who is the ninth Canadian in the Amaker-era to play for Harvard. Sakota’s success in Canada includes many accolades, among which are two Biosteel All-Canadian honors in 2018-2019 and his spot on the U16 and U17 Canadian national team rosters. Sakota’s 6’5” frame at the guard spot is complemented by great court awareness and a solid outside shot. He will have a chance to return home during the season when the Crimson travel to Toronto for the first time to play at Scotiabank Arena against Buffalo.
Tommy O’Neil
Harvard’s first Boston-area player since Kyle Casey ‘14, O’Neil hails from a basketball family: his older brothers Hugh and Harry currently play at Bowdoin and Johns Hopkins, respectively. He finished off his high school career at Vermont Academy after a decorated tenure at St. Johns Prep. O’Neil’s willingness to shoot the ball with a soft touch around the rim contributes versatility to his offensive game, as O’Neil is comfortable both in the post and from outside, much like junior Danilo Djuricic.

Season Outlook
Harvard received 15 out of 17 first place votes in the Ivy League’s preseason media poll, making the Crimson a near-unanimous choice to repeat as Ivy League Champions. The team returns meaningful contributors from last season, adds a solid freshman class, and should get former Ivy Player of the Year Seth Towns back at some point. While some warning signs remain — from Towns’s lingering knee injury to Harvard’s sky-high turnover rate last season — all of the ingredients are in place for another strong Ivy League season and an end to Amaker’s NCAA Tournament drought.

Dating a fellow Havardian is all fine and dandy until the day the relationship crumbles and you begin to bemoan the fact that you had to go and choose someone from a population of less than 7,000. Something about ending a relationship at Harvard prompts you to see them at every turn, encountering them more often than when you were together. If you’re really set on enjoying the rest of your Harvard experience without running into your ex — determined enough that you are willing to spare no expense — Flyby has you covered.
Say Fly-bye
If you’re one of the unlucky few that made the fatal decision to date intra-house, you may fret that you may never again enjoy a dhall meal in peace. If the thought of seeing your ex in the dhall is less than appealing, you may want to consider befriending the other Fly-By (the Harvard University Dining Services service housed under the Annenberg).
Remind Them You’re No Longer Their Ride or Die
Escaping your ex is no easy feat when you have nothing but your feet to carry you away. Once they’re no longer your sole-mate, invest in a scooter, so when you sense their presence, you can zoom away before the inevitably painful encounter. Bonus points if the oncoming herd (gaggle? flock?) of athletes accepts you as one of their own and lets you blend in with them.
Ex-periment with Makeup 
Trying to avoid the ex who couldn’t make up their mind on anything? Take advantage of the fact that it’s still kinda spooky season and try a new look. Plus, rest assured that no matter how much makeup you apply, your days as a clown are behind you.
Say Far-ewell
If all else fails and you can’t get your ex to leave the country, you may have to take one for the team and go to the one place they will most likely never venture: the Quad. And if they’re in the Quad, avoiding them should be a breeze — one of the primary perks of dating a Quadling.
Though avoiding your ex is a great way to escape being reminded of a void in your life, it can only be a temporary solution. At the end of the day, this is your campus just as much as it is theirs, so expect to run into your ex — and who knows, maybe one day you’ll even smile and ask them to grab a meal (though whether you’ll follow up on that is another matter entirely).
