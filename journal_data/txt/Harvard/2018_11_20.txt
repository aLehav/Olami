After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend marked the second Black Playwrights Festival at Harvard, during which both renowned black playwrights and black students at the College showcased their works over the course of several days. Their opening night featured performance excerpts from “Pass Over” by Antoinette C. Nwandu ’02 and Phillip Howze’s “Frontieres san Frontieres,” each followed by conversations between the two playwrights about their works as well as a Q&A session with the audience.
Nwandu, a playwright, currently lives in Brooklyn and writes for theater and television. Her piece, “Pass Over,” portrays a blend of modern settings and biblical allusions, detailing a conversation between a man named Moses and his friend as they speak casually about their desires to rise socioeconomically and the issue of police brutality.
“The reason I wrote this play was because I was and am still very angry about the state-sanctioned killings of young, black men, and so I just want audience members to be able to embrace and contemplate the humanity of these young characters,” Nwandu said.
Nwandu also had some thoughts about the power of theater and expression. “I think playwriting is a space of empathy,” Nwandu said. “If I can receive a story about someone who is different from me, but sense their humanity and our shared humanity, then I am a better person.”
Phillip Howze was the second playwright to have his excerpt showcased that night, his piece “Frontieres san Frontieres” depicting what he calls “a play of clowns.” Howze is a newly appointed playwriting lecturer in the Theater, Dance, and Media department.
“I’m really interested in what it means for characters to express a sense of deep embarrassment or humiliation that shows us their soul,” Howze said. “I really embrace that kind of primal sense of recreation and play and creativity which is kind of childlike.”
Both 10 minute excerpts were performed by current students at the College, including Julius Z. R. Wade ’20 and Ruva Chigwedere ’21.
“It’s just all in my mind of matter really, channeling different versions and aspects of yourself, twisting and bending them to the people that you’re playing, that you’re representing and bringing to life,” Wade said about performing and embodying the characters in “Pass Over.”
Chigwedere is an actress and one of the students taking initiative to maintain the vitality of the festival, subbing in last minute to play a role in Howze’s “Frontieres san Frontieres.”
“I found it so moving tonight that we are in Farkas Hall, where a lot of people have performed at Harvard University, and there were two black creatives who had complete authority over the room at Harvard University,” Chigwedere said. “I thought that was one of the most spectacular, moving things that I’ve been a part of in my entire time at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nov. 9 marked both the 29th anniversary of the Berlin Wall’s official fall, and coincidentally, Ieva Jusionyte’s discussion on her book “Threshold: Emergency Responders on the US-Mexico Border” at the Harvard Bookstore. The Harvard anthropology professor, recognizing the connection, noted, “It appears that history’s lessons are short-lived and now walls are popular again.”
Drawing on her experience as one of these responders working on the brink between two countries and ways of life, Jusionyte’s book examines the specific tensions faced by these courageous paramedics and firefighters. She balances personal anecdotes and specific cases faced by these workers with the academic insight of an anthropologist. Considering the tense immigration issues on America’s mind, the Trump administration has influenced the way she views and handles her latest project.
“In the light of everything that is happening in this country right now, it is very difficult for me to take this book out of the immediate context and to talk about it without reference to the current political moment,” Jusionyte said.
When the Harvard Book Store’s owner Jeff Mayersohn was asked why he invited Jusionyte in particular, he expressed a similar sentiment about her work’s timeliness.
“I think this book has a very immediate and very important topic,” said Mayersohn. This event was part of the bookstore’s weekly “Friday Forum” series, created to allow Cambridge residents and Harvard students alike to hear from influential, local authors.
Facilitating discussion, these events expose the community to new ideas. “It is one of the important services that the bookstore provides…,” Mayersohn said. “We try to have diverse voices and a diversity of topics, but also, we strive to find books that are of immediate interest.”
Starting with some opening remarks about “Threshold,” Jusionyte then gave the audience a little sneak peak by reading some hand-selected quotes. She recounted reports of helping immigrants who had broken limbs trying the scale the border wall, of a trivial, bureaucratic argument regarding the simple administration of an Advil tablet, and of the overall conflict faced by responders knowing that their patients will soon be detained and deported. After this presentation, she opened the floor to questions from the audience about her research, career, and opinions about this complex issue.
In response to a question about how she, as an anthropologist, became involved in providing aid along the US-Mexico border, Jusionyte explained that she had actually initially trained as an emergency responder, volunteering in Cambridge and also Florida. “I was more attracted to this project or interested in this problem because I was an emergency responder rather than vice versa,” she said.
However, this double identity as both a researcher and paramedic presented its own unique obstacles for her. “As an emergency responder, you sort of have this tunnel vision of treatment...and as a scholar, you need the distance to reflect. When I was at the border, my time was basically divided.”
Rebecca E. Pries, a Cambridge resident and member of the audience, attended the event in order to gain some insight from this author. “I was very interested in her research about treatment of people who become injured as they try to cross the border, and I’m very concerned about how the United States is responding to illegal border crossings,” Pries said.
Addressing these specific concerns, Jusionyte also argued, “[The border walls’] ineffectiveness has nothing to do with their height. The size of the border fences have actually doubled since the 1990s, but they failed to stop illegal drugs or deter unauthorized migrants because fortification does not address the root causes of these phenomena. What it does do, and what my book shows, is that walls have been consistently successful as a mechanism of injury.”

The endings of truly great stories linger a long time in our minds. We yearn for just a few more pages, a few more moments to revel in a masterfully-shaped adventure, to live vicariously through unreal characters who move us in very real ways, or simply to ponder and reflect on the surreal. The finality of an ending can offer a slight sadness that there is nothing more to experience, but also a satisfied sense that all has been done.
By the time this column goes to press, its author will be happily looking back on the end of an impossible story that began on a hot August day in Colorado seven years ago and ended on a cold New England weekend in New Hampshire approximately 48 hours ago. The Harvard Women’s Rugby team, the 2018 Ivy League 15s champions, defeated Quinnipiac University 47-8 the day before the Game to secure a National Intercollegiate Rugby Association championship match against Dartmouth two days later. We lost this championship match in an intense and hard-fought battle, but this was an ending to a chapter of my life that I’ll not soon forget.
The beginning of this story seven years ago, very much unlike the arrival of Tolkien’s “Long-Expected Party” in the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, was certainly anything but expected. If you had told my 15-year-old teenage self that I’d have the privilege of representing Harvard University as a member of its varsity rugby team, I surely would have scoffed at such a notion. Rugby was only something I did to pass the time until lacrosse season started, and only something I picked up to fulfill my school’s fall sport requirement with something other than field hockey.
As great stories often do, the novelty of a new adventure, colorful characters, and the thrill of battle slowly reeled me in, and I was enthralled by a sport and teammates who delivered on all the above. The providence of some divine writer must have shaped the plot of this story just so that I could be a part of Harvard rugby’s first full varsity recruiting class. In the last few years on Harvard’s brand-new rugby field, I’ve shared an incredible journey with a fellowship of steadfast friends and exceptional athletes. An eclectic, diverse group of recruits and walk-ons coalesced passionately around a shared mission in a powerful way that I believe is unique to competitive sport, where bodies and well-being are put on the line in a manner starkly different than academic or extracurricular interest.
The story of this team over the last four years is truly the stuff of miracles and a story of radical love. Surely, not every day was easy, and some difficult and painful times transpired as we wrestled with shaping our identity as an elite collegiate rugby program. We lost big games. We underwent major cultural and institutional changes. We did not always choose to be there for our teammates. We did not always choose unity. We did not always choose to play for sheer love of the game. But we learned, slowly, to make those choices every day in our battles with our personal and collective foibles and flaws, even if we didn’t realize how much we were growing as individuals and as a team.
Tolkien’s formidable contemporary C.S. Lewis once marveled at how “day by day nothing changes, but when you look back everything is different.” Indeed, grinding through day after day, month after month, year after year of practices, lifts, and competitions felt like nothing special nor even anything particularly enjoyable at times. But now, walking off the pitch for the very last time and unlacing my cleats to hang them up for good, I certainly feel like nothing is the same. I am not the same.
It has been the greatest joy and honor to journey with this team to what feels like Mordor and back, to have traversed the extremes of exhilarating victories and crushing defeats with a once-in-a-lifetime team. I may be guilty of over-sentimentalizing or over-romanticizing what is understandably sometimes criticized as an elitist, exclusive endeavor (just look at some of the revelations about athletic recruiting in the admissions trial), but the sacrifices teammates make for each other are perhaps some of the most authentic expressions of love we can make at this university, not conditioned upon anything but our commitment to each other.
These are sacrifices of time, sacrifices that ask us to put our bodies on the line for others, and responsibilities of stewardship. It is no small privilege to represent the University and display our commitment to its values and to each other in such a visceral way as bearing the crimson “H” on our jerseys. As the pages of my senior year story at Harvard continue to flip by and the end of my college days looms imminently, I am even more grateful for those sacrifices and privileges of calling myself a member of the rugby team.

You can’t be at Harvard Divinity School long before someone mentions the “Divinity School Address,” a graduation speech delivered in 1838 by renegade Unitarian Universalist minister and American Transcendentalist poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson’s Address is routinely name-dropped as part of the school’s own autohagiography — the chapel in Divinity Hall is even called “Emerson Chapel” now. However, the Address caused controversy in its time.
Emerson is, to put it mildly, critical of much of Christianity, which “aims at what is usual, and not what is necessary and eternal,” which has led to “a decaying church and a wasting unbelief.”
I couldn’t help recalling Emerson’s Address as I sat through community meetings regarding the renovation of the Divinity School’s Andover Hall.
In order to “fully modernize” Andover Hall, the Divinity School has decided to turn part of Andover’s inner courtyard into a glass pavilion, and it will house a hip cafe at ground floor and a big ol’ corporate-style conference center above. To do this, they’ll have to remove the massive, beautiful red oak tree that has been growing alongside the school for over a century.
They would be wise to listen to Emerson. At the Address’s turning point, he describes sitting in a church on a winter day as a “formalist” preached “thoughtless clamour.” “A snow storm was falling around us,” the poet states. “The snow storm was real; the preacher merely spectral; and the eye felt the sad contrast in looking at him, and then out of the window behind him, into the beautiful meteor of the snow. He had lived in vain."
Did members of the Harvard faculty feel personally repudiated by this description? Quite possibly. But what, instead, does Emerson say religion should strive to do? “The faith should blend with the light of rising and of setting suns, with the flying cloud, the singing bird, and the breath of flowers.”
To many of us at the Divinity School, the decision to kill a living being older than any of us for a new cafeteria feels like a betrayal of the School’s goals, one of which is, “To commit to ecological sustainability and good environmental stewardship.” If we cannot defer to the sanctity of life here on our small campus, how can we purport to do so in the world?
Trees are not inanimate. Trees talk to one another. Trees have social networks and relationships. Last year, I interviewed Eduardo Kohn for the Divinity School about his book “How Forests Think.” Kohn says we can talk to forests and forests can talk back. None of this is metaphorical.
Other Divinity School students and I who value beings other than humans have raised multiple objections to the killing of this tree, but each have been shot down without much evident consideration. Administrators tried to justify this decision by saying the tree is “in a downward and irreversible trend,” but the same issues they raised could be said of any urban tree. Trees, like people, were not meant for city life, and therefore most trees (and people) in the city are not in optimal health. We’ve gotten the distinct impression that the decision to kill the tree was already made, perhaps months or years ago, and there was no intention to gather or integrate real feedback.
The school says it’s necessary to kill the tree for the future of the Divinity School. They talk about sacrificing the tree as if it offered itself. Let this be clear, the tree did not consent to be killed.
The Divinity School wants so badly to be a truly interfaith institution, but trees are honored in too many religions to enumerate here. In fact, Comparative and Historical Study of Religion professor Kimberley C. Patton taught a year-long course on the cross-traditional sacrality of trees called “The Tree at the Center of the World.”  The coalition of students who are against cutting the tree includes, by my own observations, Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, Muslims, and Pagans. Just this fall, Hindu students painted the tree with a symbol representing Durga amma to celebrate the holiday of Navratri. I’ve seen Buddhist students meditating beneath it, and altars and other rituals surrounding it, marking it as holy. Some pagan students have told me they connect to trees similar to how they connect to human relatives, and I’ve watched them be gutted by this decision. These people have paid tuition to an institution that claims to value their spiritual traditions, yet this action shows those claims to be hollow.
We don’t know how old the tree is, but I’ve heard some say it could be as old as 200 years. If that’s true, it would have been here when Emerson gave his address. It may have witnessed those in power at the school at the time huff aghast at the audacity of this Bostonian punk poet.
“And it is my duty to say to you,” said Emerson in his Address, “that the need was never greater of new revelation than now. From the views I have already expressed, you will infer the sad conviction, which I share, I believe, with numbers, of the universal decay and now almost death of faith in society. The soul is not preached. The Church seems to totter to its fall, almost all life extinct.”
A glass and concrete conference center that looks like the Smith Campus Center is not new revelation. Respect and reverence for the lives of others is. I pray that the Divinity School will reconsider and find a way to preserve this life. May we still develop a faith that blends “with the light of rising and of setting suns, with the flying cloud, the singing bird, and the breath of flowers.” May we see the truth of the snow storm outside so we may not live in vain. May we feed this new revelation before all life and hope is extinct.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated Nov. 21, 2018 at 1:34 a.m.
A new court order has raised the possibility that the Harvard admissions trial may stretch well into 2019. In December and January, Harvard and the group bringing the lawsuit, Students for Fair Admissions, plan to submit more briefs. On Feb. 13, Judge Allison D. Burroughs will hear arguments from Harvard and SFFA. Additionally, outside parties will be permitted to submit amicus briefs again.
Here, Harvard has an additional opportunity to provide context regarding its admissions policies. If there is more information available to Burroughs, then she can make a more informed decision. Furthermore, the more time Harvard has to explain the way it admits students, the more the process can be scrutinized. This will demonstrate to the world the benefits of Harvard’s admissions process, but also lay the foundation for future improvements that University administrators will hopefully make to the system.
This case has important ramifications for affirmative action and may affect every private college in America — the fight to defend diversity is not over. In the past, the Supreme Court has struck down the use of a quota system; however, the use of race as a factor in admissions is still acceptable. This trial is likely to make it to the Supreme Court, where the legality of race-conscious admissions may be modified or overturned. We have previously opined on the importance of race in admissions processes, and we stand by our belief that this process makes for a fairer and more diverse admissions process. The student body should thus continue its defense affirmative action.
Given the stakes of the trial, we implore students to be informed on both the details and the implications of the case, which are definitely not clear-cut. Both SFFA and Harvard have hired statisticians to support their case. Duke economics professor Peter S. Arcidiacono and University of California, Berkeley economics professor David E. Card have created models of Harvard’s admissions process, and have come to opposite conclusions on whether Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. The implications of the data remain unclear.
We believe that more information is better. We thus welcome the opportunity the additional briefings and hearing afford Harvard to drive home its arguments, especially given the historic nature of this case.
This staff editorial is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.
Correction: Nov. 21, 2018
An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly indicated that the Harvard admissions trial is being extended, and that Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions will present new evidence in filings and a hearing scheduled for the next three months. In fact, the post-trial schedule follows standard judicial procedure for bench trials, and the trial is not being extended. The two sides will not be presenting additional evidence.

Here is how it works. An Uber slides into a parking spot, idles. Its doors pop open; young women pile out. They scurry down brick streets, toward mansions, toward spindly lines of more women threading down the block.
And then they wait.
The bouncer calls out numbers — one group of five, two more, one more, like a weird game of human bingo. The line shuffles and reshuffles as lucky winners step forward to claim their prize — admission — while others abandon the pursuit entirely. “If you’re not on the list, don’t bother standing here,” the bouncer announces in a thick Boston accent before slamming the door.
The line inches forward jerkily. Just as it begins to dwindle, another group piles onto the line, and then another. The night stretches on.
I am waiting outside the Phoenix SK Club, one of Harvard’s all-male final clubs, because I have been told this is one of the places where they congregate, many of them, and I want to see what it is like for them when they come here. The “them” is non-Harvard students, most of whom are women; the “here” is Harvard parties, most of which are ruled by men.
I have been told to look out for the Ubers, the Lyfts, the party buses. I have been told that if I study them really hard — look for fractures in confidence, sideways glances, body language that says I am uncomfortable here — I can distinguish the Harvard students from the visitors.
But everyone standing in this line looks vaguely uncomfortable. Besides the dead giveaways — vehicles parked right out front and questions like, “Is this the Phoenix?” — it is difficult to discern my potential subjects.
Tonight, underneath a freezing downpour, on Halloweekend, we all wear some iteration of the same uniform: High heels, short dresses, low tops, and an accent piece that transforms the ensemble from outfit to costume. We are all shivering, caving our bodies inwards in order to retain some semblance of warmth.
I can hear my mother, watching us. In this weather? Oh, sweetie. I zip up my raincoat.
Besides their superhuman tolerance for the cold — I appear to be the only one who chose to don outerwear — no one seems perturbed by the unspoken rules of line-standing outside Harvard parties. This part is particularly unsettling to me. I am unaccustomed to all of this, and am shocked at how callously the bouncer turns away live human beings. One woman, dripping wet and shaking in yellow spaghetti straps, tries to slip through the doorway and is immediately rebuffed. “Go back outside,” he tells her before slamming the door. She stops protesting mid-sentence, blinks, and — apparently unfazed — strikes up a conversation with the next woman in line.
The atmosphere fluctuates between tepid boredom and something that verges on the festive. Suddenly, people are making friends. Someone squeals and hugs someone else. “So nice to meet you!” Now we are all waiting in silence.
The longer I wait here, the more this line begins to resemble my personal definition of hell. To these patient, buzzed veterans, it’s something more like purgatory. They all blend together in their casual indifference toward the man guarding the door.
We are in a line of people leading toward a Harvard party, populated heavily by students who do not attend Harvard. I am trying to figure out what the non-Harvard students’ deal is.
Eventually, I begin to chat with the women: Who are you, and why are you here? I explain that I am a reporter but I speak quietly, because I don’t want the bouncer to kick me out of line.
As I suspected, many of the women I approach — around half — have come from other schools, mostly Boston University. Most don’t want to talk for long; they’re focused on pushing forward in the line.
Are the parties at all unusual? I ask one woman. “Yeah,” she slurs, clearly intoxicated. How so? She pauses. “All the boys are wearing suits!”
This student, like many women I interviewed, only agreed to be quoted anonymously. The women said they feared speaking to the press would cause male final club members to exclude them from future parties.
I ask another woman in line how the men behave inside the party. Are they respectful? “Sure, they’re respectful.” She pauses. “I don’t know that I’d say they’re fun to be around.” We giggle together. Our camaraderie ends abruptly, though, because now it’s her turn to enter the party. She seems excited enough to go inside, although it’s possible she’s simply pleased to escape the cold.
At parties like this one, I am beginning to decide, there exists some kind of complex mathematical loop. The men own the building, the alcohol, the playlist, the guest list. I think this implies that they own the party. Then I remember the party would not exist without the steady nourishment of the line, of the female bodies standing one after the other outside.
So who owns this party, really?
I don’t get a clear answer from anyone standing outside the PSK about what, exactly, draws visitors to these parties. In general, responses about the parties are mixed. Some seem genuinely thrilled to be here. Most are more jaded.
One woman describes Harvard parties as “very average,” although she decides after a few moments that the nightlife in Boston “in itself is very average.”
So why go through the trouble of coming here?
Later that night, I visit the Sigma Chi Fraternity, because I have been told that this is the other Harvard club that frequently hosts large numbers of women from other schools. This rumor proves true: a Lesley student waiting outside tells me she’s “never met a Harvard girl at a party.”
Partygoers outside the frat also say Boston’s collegiate social scene plays a role in funnelling partiers to Harvard. A lot of smaller schools are deep in the city, says an Emerson student, which means their parties frequently get shut down.
But Harvard is, presumably, not the only school in the Greater Boston area whose parties continue late into the night. There must also be a Harvard-specific appeal.
A few days later, I interview Lucy, a sophomore at BU. Lucy is not her real name — she asked that I give her a pseudonym because she feared social repercussions on her own campus.
Lucy says the “typical college parties” at her own school — “a lot of sweaty freshmen and headbanger music and jumping around in basement, keg stands and all that” — are very different from what she sees inside final clubs. “Harvard is just like cleaner and more... adult. There’s security guards there… the people are nice.” And there’s “a ton of alcohol,” she says.
Women can’t simply decide to attend a Harvard party, though. First, they need to get their names on the list. This task, I learn, requires a special kind of artistry — well-placed friends, deliberate networking that looks unintentional. Many of the women I talked to described how they spun a spiderweb of friends, often arbitrarily meeting the right person who then introduced them to more.
The presence of these women at Harvard parties is also, in part, organized by men. I am told by numerous people — friends at Harvard and women I interview — that the PSK in particular has a reputation for packing its parties with women from other schools. According to Lucy, the BU sophomore, “the Phoenix loves sororities. Every sorority gets invited to their stuff. Basically every weekend a different sorority is invited to whatever they’re having.”
PSK President Nicholas G. S. Maxwell ’19 declined to comment on-the-record.
Many of these connections are forged online. Tinder matches, for example, can lead to party invites, even if the two have yet to meet in person.
Maria, another sophomore at Boston University, says she learns about final club parties via Instagram. Maria is not her real name, either; she requested that I use a pseudonym because she feared being blacklisted.
Maria says Harvard final club boys sometimes contact her and her friends on Instagram. “They just follow our Instagrams. They’re like ‘Bring your friends.’ I’ve never experienced anything like it.”
But courting such invitations requires a degree of image curation. Looks matter. (When do they not?) This is not unique to Harvard parties, of course, but women say it’s exacerbated when restrictions on entrance are so stringent.
I ask Maddie, a sophomore at Wellesley who often attends Harvard parties, whether she feels she must look a certain way to gain entrance. (Maddie requested anonymity for the same reasons as Lucy and Maria.) Maddie says she comes to final club events every weekend and has a solid network of friends here. Appearance is significant at first, she says, “but definitely once you make more connections I think it's easier to get in.” She pauses to think. “But maybe it’s easier to make connections when you yourself are…”
Attractive?
“I mean. I'm like a tall blonde girl, um. They're not gonna…” She trails off. “Yeah.”
For some, the parties boast yet another advantage: the apparent social desirability of the men inside. “Some of my friends go because there’s that whole thing of Harvard guys,” Maria, the BU sophomore, says.
A Wentworth student outside Sig Chi puts it more frankly: “If you’re with a Harvard guy it’s like, ‘Oh, shit.’”
And some say the parties themselves offer attendees a kind of social clout.
Taylor, a Wellesley sophomore who requested a pseudonym because she feared social exclusion from the final clubs and also judgment by other Wellesley students, says of the parties: “It kinda seemed like something that all of the socially ambitious girls were doing.”
She sighs when she admits this, but I don’t blame her. After all, we — Harvard students — followed the shiny allure of elitism to this campus. It seems unfair to fault others for finding the same appeal in a corner of Harvard’s social life.
As I shiver outside these parties, I am reminded of a time earlier this year when my brother visited me at school. He was appalled that the parties I took him to placed any kind of limitations on entrance. We didn’t go to the final clubs with their paid bouncers and strict quotas, but all the places I brought him to still restricted entry in some way. He found this absurd. This is just how it is, I told him, and I found myself surprised at his surprise.
In line at the PSK, I am the visitor, the one unaccustomed to the conventions. When I eventually reach the door, the bouncer catches on to my flimsy ruse immediately. I was planning to use the name of a friend who — unlike me — is on the list, but I don’t have her ID on me. I get flustered and admit this, and suddenly the PSK’s red door is staring me in the face.
I check behind me to see who has noticed, but I realize that no one waiting in line with me cares. They are all in the same boat. They have seen it happen so many times before.
When I set out to write this piece, I hoped to get a sense of what Harvard line-waiting feels like for women not accustomed to the tiered exclusivity that permeates the campus social scene. Did they find it upsetting, being turned into names on lists, bodies in a line? As it turns out, I am the one made uncomfortable, left sputtering, while the others seem unfazed by Harvard’s norms of rejection.
Taylor, the Wellesley sophomore, tells me there’s a high likelihood that, even if she plays her cards right, taps all her sources, meticulously prepares for her weekend, she’ll gets to the front of the line and be turned away anyway.
This seems unfair, she says. “I think that’s not an acceptable system!”
“It’s interesting knowing, feeling and hearing that something is wrong, or off, about this final club dynamic,” Taylor says.
“But like. If they're going to keep throwing parties, I'm gonna keep going.”
“I have one hour.”
That’s what Taylor tells herself when she comes to parties at Harvard. Sixty minutes to meet, charm, befriend someone who will invite her to another party, another weekend. “Or else I’m never coming back.”
The social maneuvering that takes place inside the party is no less complex than that required to get on the list. Within the clubs, though, the networking takes on a different, more immediate tenor, women say.
"There is a certain amount of being judged within the first three seconds of being seen and then having to like, weasel your way into a party and you're like, wow, I immediately feel as though my existence here is just like not important." says Alison T. Carey, a junior at Wellesley.
Maria, the sophomore at BU, says the parties can be overwhelming — and that the tension can fall along gender lines.
“I know I have to establish myself as not thinking they’re above me pretty early on,” she says, referring to the Harvard men in the room. “Maybe that’s in my head, but I personally feel like if I don’t establish myself as being confident and stuff, they kind of act in a superior way. I can definitely feel the energy.”
Maria says her friends treat Harvard men as if the men “are better than” the women. As if “it’s an honor to be at their party.”
She continues: “I’ve had friends say to me, talking about a guy, ‘I wouldn’t get with him, but he goes to Harvard, so it’s okay that he’s not as cute.’” This bothers her, she says, because “it puts them at an unfair advantage with guys — I feel like they let guys treat them worse.”
Maria tells me about a friend of hers who declined to have sex with a Harvard boy after going home with him. “He got mad and told her to leave,” and then blocked her on Snapchat. “I feel like he felt entitled.”
“Another guy told my friend he didn’t think she was intellectual enough to keep talking to her,” Maria says. “I didn’t feel like it was true, I felt like he was just saying it to, like, put her down.”
Still, some women say they think Harvard parties are a good, uncomplicated time.
"In general, everyone I’ve met is very chill. I’ve become friends with people there and I’ve never felt uncomfortable,” says Maddie, the BU sophomore.
Another BU student, senior Rachel M. Trebach, says, “I don’t think I have ever had a negative experience at a Harvard party.”
And, though acknowledging the unequal gender dynamics at play inside Harvard parties, Taylor says she sees a bright side.
She says the social maneuvering required of women who visit Harvard parties has forced her to improve her social skills.
“But at the same time, I worry about this for myself," she says. "That this behavior reinforced over four years is going to do some damage — long-term damage — to my personality, where I don’t feel like the power lies with me.”
After our interview, Taylor texts me to follow up.
She forgot to mention, she writes, that “it’s usually not the guys who are rude, but the girls from Harvard. I feel like this is usually more so at places… that have female members but they’ll make blatant comments to our faces. My friends and I have discussed how we especially don’t feel like they are watching out for us as fellow women.”
Although most of the women who visit from other schools spend time in male-dominated spaces, plenty of mixed-gender groups also host parties with professional bouncers; outside the co-ed final clubs, the lines are co-ed, too.
Lucy, the BU sophomore, says she — like Taylor — has noticed a subtle hostility radiating from Harvard women. “When they like, give you a weird glance. They know you’re from BU. And they know you’re invited here ‘cause you’re a party girl.’”
Lucy says her Harvard friends sometimes talk about how often BU women are invited to parties in Cambridge. “My friends were saying this is 'cause we’re always down, and we’re always down to party… and I think they held back a few things that weren’t as friendly.”

Put more simply: Maddie, the Wellesley sophomore, says there is a perception “that we're really slutty or hoeish, coming all the way out to Harvard to party.”
Isha L. Gupta, a Wellesley sophomore, says she believes the tension between Harvard women and non-Harvard women stems from societal conditioning. “We have been trained to be pitted against each other in that context, especially a social context,” Gupta says.
Whether or not that’s true, the conflict appears to date back decades.
When I talk to Maddie, she recounts a notorious saying. “I know Harvard guys have a saying, I think an old saying — I don't know if they still say it — it's like... BU to bed and like, Wellesley to wed? Or something?”
I’ve heard this, too. Before Harvard College started admitting women several decades ago, men on campus had a favorite saying: take girls from local schools — BU, Smith, Simmons, Lesley — “to bed.” Next came “Wellesley to wed,” and, the saying finished, “Radcliffe to talk to.”
Maddie may not be wrong to reference the adage in the present tense. According to Taylor, the same kind of categorization happens today.
Taylor says her friends feel that Harvard “guys are afraid of women being higher in position from them in some way or equal in position. So I think they're looking for someone who they perceive are weaker than them and less smart as them,” she says. “And I think they think they can find that in Wellesley girls.”
Kathleen A. Chaikin, who graduated from Wellesley in 1967, remembers that, when she was a student, the only way to get off-campus was by going on a date. “You had no cars, [and] it was very hard to get anywhere on public transportation. We didn’t have Lyft; we didn’t have Uber.”
This setup “put a lot of emphasis on meeting guys. And, you know, we all thought everybody was a straight, cis-gendered woman — not that we had those terms — so I’m sure if you were LGBT it was a whole different story, so, that’s just, I just think it was an unfortunate way of living and I’m glad it’s not that way anymore,” she says.
It was a different time, Wellesley alums agree. And certainly, much has changed. Several Wellesley alums during the 1950s and '60s recall attending formal mixers at Harvard hosted by the college. Now, much of that socializing occurs in final clubs and fraternities, which have also undergone some changes over the years.
Most recently, in May 2016, the College announced it would bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations — starting with the Class of 2021 — from holding campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
Since the penalties' debut, every one of Harvard’s women-only final clubs and sororities has pledged to accept members of all genders. Men's groups have remained more resistant. Several of the historically all-male final clubs — including the PSK — are still men-only, and some of the male clubs are fighting the sanctions on Capitol Hill.
Despite these changes at Harvard, women that visit from other schools say Cambridge parties remain to some degree structured around the men.
“For me personally I'm not like, 'Yes! I'm going to this one party 'cause there's a lot of men there!'” says Maddie. “Men are garbage.” She laughs. “But sure,” she admits, on Wellesley’s campus, “I think people who aren't seeking that male interaction will stay [at Wellesley].”
Outside Sig Chi, I stand with my friend John, who has loyally tagged along with me the entire evening. Selecting him wasn't a difficult choice — he was the only person who volunteered to accompany on this venture.
The setup outside Sigma Chi is more chaotic than the PSK’s neat line. Women mill about in groups. I approach one pair, Emerson students, who tell me they’re waiting for a Tinder match they’ve never met to invite them inside.
I ask them if they feel nervous coming to this party, having never met the boy. They shrug.
“We don’t plan on hanging out with him,” one says.
I laugh. “Do you think he knows that?”
“We’re just here to party and dance. I don’t know. He knows I have my friend, so.”
Another group of Wentworth students offers a similar perspective. One says that she thinks a lot of students come here “for like, a night with the girls, because there’s not a lot of cute guys here. So we’ll come just because we know there’s music and like, we know there’s a basement and lights.”
While John and I observe the scene outside, a group of men passes by. One makes direct eye contact with me, raises his eyebrows, and says, “This looks like a fun party.” I am reminded that, despite my attempts to observe passively, I am a college-aged girl standing outside a frat party. I am automatically implicated. Much of this stuff isn’t really opt-in.
After a while, I decide to go inside. At this party I easily earn entry: the only requirement, it seems, is to be a girl. The bouncer eyes John suspiciously. John understands and bids me farewell.
In that moment, the world becomes binary: you are one or the other, in or out, listed or not, guest or host.
Once I am inside the party, it takes me only a few minutes of searching to discover the heart of the entire operation: the basement.
The party itself is aggressively ordinary. The dance floor is nowhere near capacity, but it is relatively well-attended. People are bopping gently. I hover in a corner and study the scene on the bottom of the staircase, watching the women who enter the room, peering over as their eyes adjust to the darkness, trying to discern whether they feel comfortable in the subterranean space.
Maybe they did come here to hang out with each other, as some of the women outside told me. Maybe they don’t care about their hosts. But I'm down here, too, dressing the part. I have shed my raincoat, and I can feel eyes on me. I cannot speak for these women; all I can say is that that I don't feel particularly insulated from these men. Not here in the basement.
I watch the dancing for a while. By 2 a.m., I have had enough.
I am happy to know some of these women appear to have carved this space into something they like. But the walk home is melancholy, freezing rain aside.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leverett House staff and the Dean of Students Office are currently investigating “deeply disturbing and offensive images” drawn on a public whiteboard in McKinlock Hall, according to an email sent by House tutors last Thursday.
A photo of the drawings sent to The Crimson shows depictions of two faces — one labeled “Black” and the other “Other blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, Jews” — alongside racist comments.
The board featured a list of terms including “globalists," "caravan," and “Soros," referring to billionaire philanthropist George Soros. In the lead up to the midterm elections, far-right politicians and pundits circulated a conspiracy theory that Soros was funding the caravan of immigrants traveling to the United States. Another marking on the white board labeled this list "anti semetic [sic] code words."
McKinlock resident Malaaz H. Ghandour ’19 said she passed the whiteboard several times on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. Each time, more comments had been added. After speaking with her roommate — Crimson contributing columnist Jenna M. Gray ’19 — Ghandour decided to alert her tutor and the Leverett House deans.
“I’d seen a lot of writing on the board before. A lot of it was just inane or stupid things that were supposed to be funny,” Gray said. “But I hadn’t really seen racialized comments before or anything directed at any particular ethnic group, so it stood out to me in that way.”
Late Thursday evening, John L. Pulice III ’15, who serves as a tutor in McKinlock, wrote in an email to residents that House staff had brought the matter to the attention of the Harvard University Police Department. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not respond to a request for comment.
“I am sorry if any of you were also impacted by these – no community can or should tolerate hate-speech, least of all a community that is also our home,” Pulice wrote in his email. “If any of you would like to talk about this, I and other tutors are available.”
Pulice also wrote the drawings “appear to be part of a pattern” in McKinlock — a pattern Ghandour and Gray both said they recognized. The students said they had heard of another complaint by Leverett students in response to whiteboard drawings related to gender and sexuality.
Leverett Resident Dean Bilal A. Malik wrote in an email that while House administrators are looking into “how these drawings appeared,” their “first and foremost priority is working with our students and other community-members, to understand how they were impacted, and how we can help.”
Malik added Leverett House is working with the Dean of Students Office to respond to the incident.
Gray called the administrators’ response to the drawings “vague” and said she would prefer “something more specific that addresses the groups that were targeted on the board.”
“I'm glad that they expressed words of outrage but it also sounded like a pretty standard response,” she said. “I haven't heard really any action being taken or anyone being held accountable for what they wrote.”
This semester, similar instances of racist public postings have cropped up at other Ivy League colleges.
Dartmouth students reported racist slurs and vandalism on the doors of their dorms in October. Last week, Yale students witnessed two masked figured posting “racially provocative” flyers across campus advertising a “white student’s [sic] union.”
At both schools, administrators have encouraged students to attend gatherings to discuss the incidents and reach out to support networks, but neither school has yet taken disciplinary measures against perpetrators.
Ghandour and Gray said they hope the same will not happen at Harvard. Ghandour said she hopes Leverett House will take concrete action in response to the incident, beyond simply offering resources.
“I don’t need that, and I think a lot of people of color on this campus or marginalized groups are always told like ‘hey if you ever need to talk, we have resources,’” she said. “To me, it’s not about talking or being consoled, it’s about action.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard launched the Harvard Quantum Initiative last Wednesday, aiming to foster interdisciplinary collaboration in pioneering quantum methods of computing and sensing.
Initiative co-directors Evelyn Hu, professor of applied physics and electrical engineering, and physics professors John M. Doyle and Mikhail D. Lukin said they believe modern technology is on the cusp of a quantum revolution — one that will bring together people from diverse academic and industry backgrounds, including physics, chemistry, and engineering.
Quantum mechanics, the study of atoms and subatomic particles, enables scientists to more precisely determine the state of particles within an atom. It has broad applications in a variety of fields, ranging from metrology, the study of measurement, to computing, to biomedical diagnostics.
Hu said the idea to create the initiative has been nearly a decade in the making and was inspired by the formation of similar research groups such as Harvard’s Center for Integrated Quantum Materials and MIT’s Center for Ultracold Atoms.
“We can control information and the way we send information, and do it so much more efficiently and differently than we’re used to doing,” Hu said. By translating the theoretical science of quantum mechanics into engineering actual devices, she said the initiative could catalyze a “tremendous leap forward.”
Doyle said in the past decade, quantum science has developed to the point where researchers can manipulate the “spins” of individual particles in an almost “ideal” manner, the way undergraduates learn about quantum phenomena in their theoretical courses. This precise level of control has powerful implications for the future of quantum computing.
“There are really important problems, some of them very easy to describe, that are incredibly difficult to compute,” Doyle said. “But if you take these spins and hook them up in the right way, you can actually solve those kinds of problems.”
Lukin said one of the initiative's main objectives is to “provide a platform for partnering between academia and industry and the government.” In particular, he said he is eager to work closely with scientists conducting research in government laboratories, which have historically been the sites of great innovation.
Doyle said this level of collaboration, which will allow scientists in different sectors to pool their knowledge and resources, is “unprecedented.”
“There is no equivalent anywhere where we all have this vision about how we can make the working together of different parts of the entire system — the government labs, the companies — work better than it has in the past,” he said.
“We’re really trying to create something new, where things work better and we actually turn some of this science into engineering and products that are useful,” Doyle added.
Hu said the long-term success of the initiative relies on the contributions and commitment of every member to a shared vision. To achieve this, Hu said one of the Initiative’s top priorities — especially in its early stages — is to make all members of the community feel welcome.
All three professors said they were eager to find novel ways to integrate the ideas of quantum mechanics and engineering into undergraduate education. Hu suggested potentially establishing a quantum mechanics track under an existing concentration or creating a new concentration altogether, as well as designing a General Education course that could introduce the concepts explored by faculty at the initiative.
Hu said she believes the initiative capitalizes on the diverse expertise of faculty members at Harvard and partner institutions like MIT, and draws on the willingness to collaborate and innovate that “make[s] Harvard Harvard.”
“We think we’re at that moment of fission, that moment of mitosis, that we need to be different. We need to be separate. We need to develop our own species, or subspecies,” Hu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council released a statement at its Sunday meeting calling for Harvard to rehire former University Health Services employee Mayli Shing, whose February firing has prompted a protracted battle between her supporters and administrators.
In her termination letter, University officials stated that Shing engaged in “insubordinate conduct in repeatedly disregarding instructions.” The letter specifically references an incident in which Shing arrived at work 30 minutes before her shift began, despite previous warnings not to do so.
Shing contends the University fired her in retaliation for filing claims of workplace racism and sexual harassment against a supervisor. Shing’s union representative, Geoffrey Carens, has pointed to her past evaluations describing her as “extremely reliable,” stating the University’s reasoning in Shing’s termination letter was “arbitrary.”
Carens and Shing’s supporters have demanded the University rehire her, as well as provide compensation for the five-month period between her firing and the time she became eligible for state unemployment benefits.
In its Sunday statement, the UC echoed these demands.
“As the world’s leading university, Harvard has a responsibility to take a stand against sexual assault,” the UC wrote. “Fear of retaliation when one bravely speaks out against sexual harassment, as Mayli did, only to be fired without unemployment benefits, is exactly why people do not come forward about sexual harassment, and what allows sexual harassment to persist.”
“As we also saw with the case of Government professor Jorge Dominguez, Harvard must work harder to prevent workplace harassment and to protect victims of such discrimination,” the statement continued. In February and March, nearly twenty women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Dominguez, who has since retired from the University.
The Council’s statement comes in the wake of multiple protests organized by a loose coalition of campus groups calling for Shing’s reinstatement. The Harvard No Layoffs Campaign, Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better have hosted at least four rallies to support Shing, including a demonstration in October outside the office of Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran.
University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in an emailed statement Monday that Harvard values the “contributions” of its employees.
“As a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual personnel matters,” she wrote. “Harvard is committed to maintaining a safe, comfortable, and diverse working environment for all of its employees, and complaints of harassment and discrimination are investigated promptly and fairly under the applicable university policy.”
Carens spoke at a UC meeting in late October, urging the Council to get involved in the effort to rehire Shing.
Mather House Representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 — who sponsored the statement along with newly-elected UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 — said the UC had an obligation to step in to support groups on campus who are advocating for Shing’s rehiring.
“It really shows survivors and allies that have gone through sexual assault or sexual harassment that the UC as a body is here to support the students, and that is something that can be very valuable,” Mahajan said.

Meredith B. Rosenthal, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, will direct the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative starting in January 2019.
Rosenthal, who previously served as one of the 14 ALI co-chairs, will succeed faculty chair and director Rosabeth M. Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor. The ALI provides a year-long fellowship to prepare successful leaders to translate their skills to public service. The nearly 300 alumni of the program have gone on to tackle economic, education, and health issues on a national and global scale.
Kanter co-founded ALI in 2008 with current Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohria. Kanter has served as the inaugural faculty director and chair of the initiative.
“As the faculty director from the beginning, she took a nascent idea and crafted a genuinely novel and extraordinarily successful program,” Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an email.
A decade later, the program is moving forward with new leadership. Howard K. Koh, a School of Public Health professor and ALI co-chair, said “it was a natural time to start thinking about the next phase.”
A search committee comprised of Harvard faculty members affiliated with ALI selected the next faculty chair-director. Khurana, who participated in discussions about the search, said the decision to select Rosenthal “made a lot of sense.”
“Professor Rosenthal has been a participant faculty member and contributed to the program for many years,” Khurana said. “I think her own scholarship and her own kind of teaching reflects the ability to understand and work on large complex problems that cut across disciplinary boundaries.”
Rosenthal, who researches healthcare policies that slow the growth in spending and maximize value, has advised federal and state policymakers and testified before Congress on matters relating to healthcare programs.
During her time serving as a faculty co-chair of ALI, she formed a cross-school executive committee to help bring University faculty together in teaching and mentoring ALI fellows, Garber said.
Rosenthal also served as associate dean for diversity at the School of Public Health, working to promote equity and inclusivity. She declined to be interviewed for this story.
Barry R. Bloom, a School of Public Health professor, ALI founding board member, and long-time colleague of Rosenthal, lauded Rosenthal’s expertise in economics as well as her “gift of empathy.”
“In addition to her academic work and her teaching work and her mentoring work, for a period of time she took an administrative role looking at issues to make people who come to the Public Health School...feel welcome and supported,” Bloom said.
“She’s a person who’s very generous in spirit, wise in her counsel, and highly talented and encouraging in her heart,” Koh said. “Everyone’s delighted that she’ll be the next leader of this initiative.”
“Harvard’s Advanced Leadership Initiative has had a tremendous impact in its first 10 years thanks to the passion of its fellows and Rosabeth’s strong leadership,” Rosenthal said in an ALI press release.
Kanter will continue to teach at the Business School while working on her own research and writing.
Garber, who has provided significant support to ALI since its founding, wrote that he is enthusiastic about the program’s future.
“ALI attracts remarkable individuals who have already had distinguished careers, enabling them to build upon their talents and experiences to contribute to the public good in new ways,” Garber wrote. “Professor Rosenthal will build upon the foundation that Professor Kanter established as she leads the next phase of ALI's evolution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As political divisions in the United States deepen and create fissures across Harvard’s campus, University President Lawrence S. Bacow is following in his predecessor’s footsteps — taking a stand when he perceives Harvard’s interests to be under threat, and largely keeping quiet when issues turn political.
With nearly five months of his presidency under his belt, Bacow has already faced a number of high-profile challenges: a high-stakes lawsuit fighting the College’s race-conscious admissions policies, federal legislation hostile to higher education, and a contentious Supreme Court nominee with Harvard ties.
National politics and University issues are increasingly intertwined, and Bacow has spent the first months of his presidency defining his approach to a role that requires he remain nonpartisan.
“The challenge arises when we have contentious issues and people want us — either the University or a school or a dean or a president — to take a stand and the problem is where reasonable people can differ on certain issues, I believe it's the function of a university to encourage debate,” Bacow said in an October interview. “If we take a position, we're not encouraging debate, we are ending it.”
The confirmation fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh marked an early test of this philosophy.
Controversy engulfed Kavanaugh’s confirmation process when several women came forward with allegations that a young Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted them decades earlier. The allegations sparked protests at Harvard Law School, where Kavanaugh had taught for a decade. He was scheduled to teach a course on the Supreme Court again starting in the winter, and protesters called on Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 to bar Kavanaugh from returning to campus pending a full investigation into the assault allegations.
Manning refused to take a stand on the future of Kavanaugh’s teaching post, prompting further outcry from students. Kavanaugh ultimately decided on his own to step down from his position, Bacow told faculty assembled at an October faculty meeting.
“My understanding is that Kavanaugh decided not to teach this next January and that decision is year-to-year,” Bacow said. “I don’t know more of how that decision was made.”
Throughout the turmoil, Bacow remained silent, letting the Law School respond on its own to student demands that focused national media attention on Cambridge.
Bacow said in an interview last month that he is counseling deans and other top administrators across the University on how to take official stances while still fostering productive dialogue — particularly when students call on administrators to speak out on contentious issues.
“We have had conversations and we continue to have conversations about how do we encourage and maintain civil dialogue and civil discourse in the University,” Bacow said. “There are a whole set of issues where people would love for us to take a stand.”
The Academic Council — comprised of deans, vice presidents, and members of the Provost’s office — has served as a forum for these discussions. Bacow rebranded the group of Harvard administrators, which was formerly known as the “Council of Deans.”
Bacow said he did not specifically discuss the Kavanaugh controversy with the Academic Council, instead offering suggestions for when it was appropriate for administrators to take a public stance.
Bacow’s reticence to weigh in on politicized issues comes at a time when conservatives have accused universities of being bastions of liberalism — a narrative Bacow has thus far sought to counter. He devoted a significant portion of his 35-minute inaugural address in October to discussing the University’s interest in fostering dialogue among those with opposing viewpoints.
“We should not be afraid to welcome into our communities those who challenge our thinking,” Bacow said in his speech.
When issues have direct bearing on the University’s mission, though, Bacow is more willing to pick sides.
His leadership philosophy “doesn't mean that we never express opinions,” he said. “Obviously we do, but typically we do on those issues — the lawsuit is a good example — that are central to the institution, or the institution has had a long-standing point of view and where we should not be bashful about defending it.”
He has spoken out about the University’s position on the admissions lawsuit, penning emails to students and alumni supporting Harvard’s affirmative action policy and unequivocally denying that the school discriminates in its admissions process.
In an October email to Harvard affiliates, Bacow acknowledged that “reasonable people may have different views” — but he made his own abundantly clear. He has repeatedly maintained that he is confident Harvard will win in court.
In line with his goal of balancing perspectives, though, Bacow said even when administrators choose to advance a particular argument, they should remain cognizant that some may disagree.
“Even when we have such positions, we need to recognize that not everybody is going to agree with us and be respectful about those who have other points of view,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Union of Mixed Students received official recognition from the Undergraduate Council earlier this month to become the first group on campus for all mixed-race students.
Since it began recruiting members last week, the group has attracted plenty of immediate interest, and its membership list now includes more than 100 students. Founders Iris R. Feldman ’20, Antonia Scott ’20, and Isaiah Johnson ’20 said they want the organization to serve as an inclusive space for all identities shaped by the needs and ideas of its members.
Scott said she was partially inspired to create the group after seeing mixed-race organizations at other colleges and she wanted to replicate the same experience at Harvard, which did not have a group for all mixed-race students on campus.
“It was something that was really exciting to me because it was a part of my identity that I could explore and find people to understand and connect with,” Scott said. “People like Iris also had similar feelings, so she kind of approached us about actually getting serious about making it happen.”
Harvard did boast one group for mixed-race students prior to the formation of HUUMS — the Half-Asian People's Association. Though HAPA formed before HUUMS, it is targeted speficially to part-Asian students, meaning HUUMS is the first Harvard group to accept and serve mixed students of all racial backgrounds.
Feldman said she was motivated to create the union to provide a space for people who felt their identity did not fall into just one of Harvard’s cultural organizations.
“While you are a part of these two communities, there is a unique, separate, mixed identity that a lot of people experience,” Feldman said. “I want to make sure that we can acknowledge that and give people the space to explore what that means and the unique challenges and cool things that you have from that.”
Scott said the group will allow mixed students from a wide variety of backgrounds to bond over their mutual experiences and create a supportive network.
“Even when we have different experiences, it’s just good to know that there are other people having similar struggles that you can kind of figure stuff out with,” Scott said.
Both Feldman and Scott said inclusivity is important to them, and they plan to incorporate the concept into their new organization. They will hold both informal and formal discussions within the organization and also create a communal resource base for articles pertaining to the identities of mixed race people.
"I think something that was very helpful for me was to be able to find...a lexicon from which to draw to talk about my experience,” Feldman said. “So that everyone is able to put words to it, find their identity, speak about what they are saying, and communicate to others the experience that they’ve had.”
Feldman and Scott said they hope to recruit a diverse membership by reaching out to as many of Harvard’s cultural groups as possible, publicizing the organization over a multitude of email lists, and personally reaching out to peers to spread the word.
“We want to be as inclusive as possible, especially when we’re talking about mixed people, making sure we’re not just talking about people who are mixed with white, or people who are black and white,” Feldman said.
“Using the word mixed is very intentional. We're not multiracial or biracial, or whatever it is. If you identify as mixed, whatever that word means to you, please come,” Feldman added. “Please come and make this a community for you.”
The group will have its first meeting on Dec. 6 at 5:30pm in Sever 102.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 This weekend, Harvard beat Yale for the first time since 2015. Rather than Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl, the 45-27 Crimson win in the 135th rendition of The Game was hosted by Fenway Park as Harvard Stadium was reported to be under construction.
The move represented the first time in 106 years that the rivalry — the second oldest in college football — has been played somewhere other than the stadiums of the two hosts. The contest brought the largest attendance of any game this season to the sold out ballpark for a game with no Ivy League title ramifications, and a challenge simply for the pride of victory.
SLIDING ON SOD
The problem with playing football on a baseball field is that baseball fields aren’t all grass. At least in Fenway Park, where the game was hosted, the facilities staff had to transport sod pallets to cover up the infield dirt. Rolling them out across the original surface, the staff created a football field that spanned from the third base line to the right outfield wall.
Still, the new sod didn’t behave much like a grass field. To the casual observer, it looked as though everything was normal, but the first indication of a different playing surface came even before the opening kickoff.

As the two teams trotted to their respective locker rooms following their warm-ups, several grounds workers scrambled onto the field to fill up divots and plug the holes already created.
The second indication was more of a foreshadowing. On the second play of the contest, Crimson quarterback Tom Stewart took the ball himself four yards up the field. Prior to being tackled, the senior elected to slide. As he went down, his foot stuck in the turf and he rolled forward unnaturally on the four-yard run.
About 55-minutes later, Stewart went down of his own accord again. This time he did not get up.
As the senior escaped pressure and went to slide as to avoid unnecessary contact, again his foot stuck. This time, a straighter leg caused the injury that left him on the ground. A stretcher was rolled onto the field and Stewart, the senior in his final football game, was rolled away.
“The turf was outstanding all things considered,” coach Tim Murphy said. “When you consider that it’s a baseball field, when they have to bring in sod. I thought the Fenway people did a remarkable job when you consider the weather we’ve had over the past 10 days. I thought the conditions were outstanding for this time of year in terms of this not being a true football field.”
STEWART IS STUBBORN
“Tom wasn’t supposed to play,” Murphy said.
In last week’s contest with Penn at Franklin Field, Stewart rolled left before a host of Penn players forced him into the turf hard. The senior was helped off the field by Harvard coaches. Sophomore quarterback Jake Smith spelled the Stewart while the starter was evaluated by medical staff.
Stewart, who also serves as the holder for field goals, did not return to the quarterback spot for the remainder of the Penn game but did trot back into play to hold the final PAT for the Crimson. The hold came after the last PAT had failed due to a muffed snap by the holder.
In light of his return to action in the final minutes of play, most thought his prior injury must not be serious and he would be good to go for Yale. It turns out that was not the case. Throughout the week of practice leading up to The Game, Stewart didn’t take a single snap.
“He said ‘I’ll play, I’ll play,’” Murphy said. “He hadn’t thrown a pass in a week when he warmed up in pre-game.”
In the Saturday contest, Stewart went 18 of 27 through the air for three touchdowns, one interception, and 312 yards.
KICKERS ARE PEOPLE TOO
Place kicker Jake McIntyre has been golden all season and at Fenway Park, he successfully booted an effort from 36-yards out to push Harvard's one-point lead to four. This field goal pushed the McIntyre to tie both the single season record at 13, and the tie the career high made field goals at 30.
“He’s an amazing kid,” Murphy said. “He’s so incredibly consistent that we sort of just assume it’s going to happen. His level of excellence is just amazing. That kid’s going to go a long way in life because that’s how he does everything. It’s just how he is. It’s just extraordinarily efficient in a lot of different stuff.”
This season saw McIntyre miss a total of two kicks, counting PATs. The junior made 13 boots for three points and converted on all 31 of his PATs.
In addition to his near-perfect record on the field, one of these field goals won the Crimson the game. In the contest against Holy Cross, Harvard trailed by one as the time ticked toward zero. Murphy sent out McIntyre and — after an icing timeout by the visiting Holy Cross — the junior nailed the walk off 25-yarder.
“On the sideline obviously I thought about the fact that they’d ice me, and I never really considered that a big factor,” McIntyre said. “But when you hop on the field and you can trust and rely on everyone else out there, whether it’s Jack Stansell or Tom Stewart, or everyone else blocking on the line, it makes everything else a hell of a lot easier. So I don’t really know what was going through my mind at that moment, but they set me up in a good position and I’m glad the way it turned out.”
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA
Early in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s contest, the Crimson led Yale by one point, but was driving down the field. Senior quarterback Tom Stewart nailed junior wide receiver Jack Cook for a 32-yard gain. Then sophomore wide out Tyler Adams added another 16 to the tally.
From the Bulldogs’ 27-yard line, running back Devin Darrington broke through the line right and sprinted down the sideline. The sophomore easily outpaced the entire defense and as he breezed past the final defender, he point out his index finger prior to gliding into the endzone.
Immediately, yellow flags dirtied the field. Darrington was called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the touchdown erased. Harvard’s lead dropped from seven to one.
“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen anything like that but the bottom line is he was wrong,” Murphy said. “He was wrong. It’s that simple. It was the right call. He was wrong.”
A gif of the play was picked up by Deadspin and posted on twitter with the caption “Harvard touchdown called back after running back flipped Yale’s defense the bird:” The tweet received over 100 retweets and 400 plus favorites. The story was picked up by several other news outlets including Bleacher Report, Fox News, CBS Sports, and others.
A photo from The Crimson’s associate multimedia editor Timothy R. O’Meara ‘20, tweeted by the Harvard Crimson Sports twitter account showed clearly that it was in fact, the index finger of Darrington that was being held up. Citing the photo, the news organizations have since issued corrections.
The penalty wasn’t the only one major ramifications for the Crimson in the contest. Cornerback Wes Ogsbury was ejected from play after he tackled a Bulldog receiver in a manner that was deemed targeting by the officials. The senior had led Harvard in interceptions this season and was leading the contest in tackles prior to his ejection.
