After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“My name is Skinhead Girl.”
“My name is Orpheus.”
“My name is Eurydice.”
“My name is disappear. My name is disappear. My name is disappear.”
The voiceovers, overlapping, echo through the auditorium. Orange and blue spotlights illuminate a jungle gym structure, constructed from what appear to be metal pipes, erected in the middle of the stage. Overhead, strings of moss hang from the ceiling. Stage left, a pool of real water ripples; stage right, a chain-link fence blockades a region from the rest of the stage.
The scene is set for the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s annual Visiting Director’s Project: “Polaroid Stories.” Written by Naomi Iizuka and directed by Jacqui Parker, the play tells the story of 12 homeless teenagers who navigate their identities while coping with sexual abuse, drug addiction, and prostitution. The characters interact within the parameters of the Village, a microcosm of the real world. Based loosely on Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” the play blends classical mythology and contemporary testimonies from real victims of homelessness.
The structure and language of the play deviate considerably from conventional theater. “While most of it is chronological, there are bits of the past in there, and it’s not one solid storyline that you can just immediately follow. There are different little stories in between,” says Enosa J. Ogbeide ’20, who plays Eurydice.
The language of the script, too, is an unorthodox mélange of the ancient and the contemporary. “The infusion of Greek Mythology really brings real life stories together with some fantasy,” Parker writes in an email. “So even though it is a tough subject matter[,] there is still love, laughter and really fun characters[,] many filled with pain but living their truth, in a language that I call ‘Street Poetry.’”
“Trying to bring together these two seemingly disparate themes into a cohesive piece was fascinating,” Jerry G. Nelluvelil ’18, assistant director, says. “Especially when you think of Greek mythology, you think of opulence and beauty. This story allows us to bring beauty and a better understanding of the issues we talk [about]…. The themes that are being tackled and the stories that are being told are new and relevant.”
“Opulence and beauty” are a far cry from the grittiness of the subject matter. “One thing that’s helpful for me to do when playing D is understanding that all the characters that we’re playing here are real stories, and it’s important to separate that from who we are as people, because we don’t want that to be a part of us,” Julius Z. R. Wade ’20 says. “But we do want to make sure that we do the stories justice and that we give respect to the tragedy that is this world that we inhabit.”
At first, those at the helm of the production were uncertain whether students would be able to handle such a serious play, according to Emily E. Bergquist ’18, a producer. “Jacqui actually brought the play to us and said, ‘Do you think this is going to be too dark for Harvard students? Do we think this is the right material?’ And my co-producer and I both read it, and we both immediately said, ‘No this is absolutely perfect,’” she says. “To me on the bigger picture, I saw it as a way for some of our amazing actors to flex their chops.”
“Working with Harvard students was humbling and challenging because I knew their lives would be very different from those in the world of the play,” Parker writes. “I remember in the beginning I was so worried about introducing them to this very real, dark world. I just kept wanting to take care of them. But they proved me wrong letting me know they could handle the play and they have worked hard to make come to life.”
Parker’s expectations for the cast were high. For Rory K. Wakeford ’20, acting with a professional director was a novel experience. “She treats us not like college students and more like real actors,” she says. “It was really nice to get that experience because I don’t feel like I’m in a college production, because I’m working with a real director.”
Cast members recognize that they approached the script with a level of privilege. “There’s sometimes the question: ‘You’re Harvard students, and you’re playing homeless kids.’ That can be seen as a strange paradox,” says Derek P. Speedy ’18, who plays Orpheus.
Kristina N. Neal ’19, an assistant director, agrees. “All the students here are in a very particular place of privilege due to the nature of our university, despite our separate economic backgrounds that we came from,” she says. “We come here, and we have access to so much that people outside of these walls don’t,” she says. “And then, physically surrounding the Yard and all the places that we live in Cambridge, there is this huge population of houseless individuals…. We know that this show can’t change the whole world, but we’re hoping that the next time you’re walking by… you acknowledge their humanity, and their dignity, and you think, they have a story.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Common used to be a place that brought out the best in people.
George Washington once pitched his tent on the Common as he drilled his troops for war. Until the early 19th century, it was the site of weeklong Harvard commencement festivities. For much of its history, the Common was a place for patriotism and celebration.
But by the 1970s, the City of Cambridge had removed the Washington Elm under which George had once sat, paved over a sliver of the Common to accommodate a parking lot, and planned to erect a 15 story building on the rest.
Nowadays, more than 10,000 pedestrians pass through the park but very few pause to linger, to celebrate nature in a hectic cityscape.
It’s time to bring back the spirit of 1634—the year that the Massachusetts Bay Colony set aside common lands for the town of Cambridge. The park should still be a lively, social hub, a place to remember our past, relax our minds, and support our city.
The history of Cambridge Common is older than Harvard’s. The early Puritans who settled the area grazed their animals on what were at the time the northernmost reaches of Cambridge. At night, wolves still prowled the Common. It was civilization’s furthest frontier.
By the Revolutionary War, the Common had taken on the dimensions it has today. During the war, it served as barracks for the Continental Army. Throughout the 19th century, the Common continued to be a vibrant space, although its purposes had changed. It hosted the town fair, replete with clowns, mummies, and peep shows—a spectacle that rankled the descendants of the Puritan founders. But today, the Common is often so eerie and desolate that it might as well have been paved over.
It’s a shame that the history imbued in the Common—accumulated over centuries of use—has been forgotten and neglected. The cannons at the Common’s western edge are rumored to be the ones Colonel Henry Knox brought from Fort Ticonderoga for the siege of Boston. It is a reminder that fighting for what we believe in takes guts. Across from the cannons is the Soldiers Monument which portrays a lone soldier bowing his head in mourning. Sometimes, fighting for what we believe in means giving our lives. These monuments—as well as the Irish Famine Memorial—are heady stuff, tailored to thought and reflection.
The more recent history of the Common—as a place for fun and relaxation—should not be forgotten either. The Puritans may have founded the park, but they also contributed to the notion that lounging in it is a vice. Far from being a sin, however, lounging in an autumn breeze is a perfect time for mental rejuvenation. The benefits of basking in nature are noted and numerous. “The enjoyment of scenery employs the mind without fatigue and yet exercises it; tranquilizes it and yet enlivens it,” wrote Frederick Law Olmsted, one of the geniuses behind the design of Central Park in New York City. An autumn trip to the Common can break the monotony of Lamont and Widener, Sever and CGIS.
Finally, a city is only as good as its public spaces. We can’t let them fall into disuse. Every used needle that lies strewn on the Common’s grass, every emergency resuscitation, is indicative of a broader dismantling of our civic life. Supporting the park is a way to voice support more broadly for what a city can accomplish. It is a way we can bring to life our civic aspiration for community.
Let’s all join in the reclamation effort. Last year, the Common added 120 more trees, benches, and LED lights. Taking advantage of these additions is a tacit way to appreciate the work of our city council. “It’s great to have [the Common] renovated,” Cambridge Vice Mayor Marc McGovern said. “It’s great to have it continue to be a place where people can gather, and share ideas, and walk through and enjoy the space in a city that’s ever becoming more dense and crowded.”
Now it just needs bright minds to populate it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here in the civilized worldStranger events by far occur,Than in the Country of Cropped Hair;Before our very eyesWeirder tales unfoldThan in the Nation of Flying Heads
-Pu Songling, Preface to “Stealing a Peach”
My first encounter with the age-old Chinese fascination with the bizarre took place in the dusty third floor of Wangfujing Bookstore. It had been a thoughtless summer of wandering through the expatriate-dominated parts of the city; that day, I was looking for English editions of Joyce when I chanced upon a pirated Penguin copy of “Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio” by Pu Songling. Pu lived in Shangdong Province during the reign of the Manchus from 1640-1715. After failing to secure a Mandarin appointment, he turned his attention towards collecting stories of strange or inexplicable happenings around the empire from travelers passing by his home. In the end, he collected 104 of them—each narrated with pithy, journalistic apathy—in his opus, "Strange Tales." A man practicing yoga in Zichuan is visited by a three-inch-tall homunculus whom he believes holds the secret of the immortality elixir; when the creature disappears, the man suffers a nervous breakdown. A scholar-gentleman is seduced by a fox-spirit disguised as a beautiful woman, and after they have sex, his body wastes away. There is no typical story in "Strange Tales," but these capture the two themes that rule the text: sex and violence. Both find their symbolic expression in the figure of the fox-spirit: that fatal, crepuscular immortal of the scholar-gentleman’s secret imagination who takes on the form of a beautiful woman to seduce and destroy.
The book took me captive, and soon I found myself furtively flipping through the pages whenever I had a spare minute at work or in my apartment. Pu Songling himself crept into my ear in homunculus form and in the dim expanse of twilight showed me a city stranger than the Country of Cropped Hair.
That summer two very strange things happened in Sanlitun Village, an outdoor shopping mall (considered, I am told, among the best in the world) that serves as Beijing’s social and commercial hub. Both of these things happened at the flagship Uniqlo store—a Technicolor monolith and local landmark that demarcates the northeast corner of the Village.
The first: in mid-July, a video emerged over WeChat (a popular Chinese social media platform) of a couple having sex in one of the store’s fitting rooms during shopping hours. The man—tightly wrapped in black jeans, button-down, and sweater—held the camera and his narrow frame stiffly towards the mirror while the woman, naked, thrust her hips back into him, moaning and arching her head back to kiss his neck. “Don’t be too loud,” the man added nervously.
“Call me husband,” he added in a small, timid voice; “husband,” she echoed. I laughed—then, something inside me started. I looked from the thick, black frame of his glasses to the burnt, orange locks of the woman’s hair, bouncing off of her bare back. I froze, recognizing them instantly: the gentleman-scholar and the fox.
The story was national news. An amateurish video that would have slipped into obscurity in the United States became a cultural sensation. I visited Sanlitun for dinner later that evening. A throng of locals and tourists had formed around the store, drawn by some strange magnetic force, posing sheepishly for selfies. Voyeurism soon denatured into fixation. The video disappeared, blocked by internet censors, but the crowds lingered for several weeks afterwards; Beijing was enraptured, and she did not want to forget. I learned later that local police had arrested the couple in the video for corrupting public morality.
The second: in late July, on the morning of my last day in Beijing, a man wielding a three-foot-long katana stabbed a woman to death in front of the Uniqlo store in broad daylight. Amateur news outlets were the first to pick up the story; photographs and videos followed soon after. In one video, we see the slain woman, whose body had been picked up and sprawled thirty meters away from her murderer, bleeding profusely through the deep wound in her chest as her husband (a French man) applies pressure. Somehow the hems of her olive dress have ridden up, exposing her bare, yellow legs to the camera. Then the shot pans to a man, dressed casually in a button-down, black baseball cap, and jeans, stalking nonchalantly around the empty plaza like a tiger in its enclosure, trailing the sword still wet with blood behind him. Ten seconds later, he strikes a pose so casual the viewer almost misses the bizarre scene three meters away from him: a dismembered white plastic mannequin, legs and arms strewn across the ground, the severed torso seated and erect at attention. A few minutes later, the police arrive on the scene. The man calmly tosses his katana aside and lies down on his stomach. They surround him. Murder, refrain, and finale—a sequence so orderly, so free of chaos it felt rehearsed, more like performance art than crime.
Subsequent pictures from later in the afternoon showed the plaza eerily empty, roped off with yellow tape. But when I visited during the evening the Village was full again, the ropes removed, the blood scrubbed away. A small throng of fanatics had once again formed around Uniqlo, taking pictures and filling the plaza with idle laughter. As I walked through the Village a palpable anxiety fluttered in my chest. The two incidents—the private penetration made public, the public stabbing made private—conflated and intermingled with each other until they were impossible to separate. Things had returned to normal, but a rupture had made itself seen in the social fabric of Beijing. Somewhere in my head, the homunculus was buzzing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given the mania surrounding admissions to highly selective institutions such as Harvard College, many students are curious about the exact qualities that gained them admission.  And in a sharp increase over the previous year and a half, more than 100 students each month have indulged their curiosity and  exercised their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to schedule an appointment to review their admissions profiles—an unprecedented spike  that has driven the Registrar’s office to dedicate a single person to handling these requests.
The recent uptick in interest raises intriguing questions about students’ exact relationship with the College’s admissions rate. With the College’s admission rate ticking toward the low single digits, many Harvard students may have questioned their admission at one time or another.
Parsing through an application might seem like the ideal remedy to these anxieties about admission. And it is impossible to foresee all the possible reasons a student would want to peruse an admissions file. Nevertheless, the recent spike seems to be the result largely of students’ need for reaffirmation and of the call of the unknown. If these superficial motives are truly driving the increase in requests, we believe students should subject their impulse to view their files to greater scrutiny.
For one, despite the natural inquisitiveness about admissions that we all share, wading through admissions files is no idle pastime,  and the potential downsides of viewing these files could oftentimes exceed  the benefits. In the best case scenario, a student reading his or her admission file would learn what they already knew: an admission officer liked their essays, their test scores and grades were high enough, and their extracurricular activities were compelling—if any of that information could even be divined from the series of numbers and short comments included by admission officers.
By contrast, viewing admission files could also tell students that an essay they were especially proud of was not as good as they reckoned, or that their extracurricular activities were lacking. These revelations would only exacerbate any lingering anxieties, despite the underlying irony that any of these trivialities were irrelevant, since the applicant gained admission to the College. Furthermore, the very act of requesting an admissions file perpetuates the fetishization of admissions to elite colleges; if students are happy because they have the privilege of attending Harvard, rather than merely because they were admitted to a highly selective institution, then the specifics of their admission should be of no substance to them.
Of course, we do not object in principle to the law mandating that students have access to such files, but this abstract support does not mean that students necessarily should read admissions files. FERPA allows students significant privacy and independence as it relates to their educational records, and in some instances students may very well have good reasons for reading their admission files. It is imperative that federal law preserves this right; we simply believe that it should be exercised with caution.
But the mindless exercise of students' rights under FERPA will only create a  more unhealthy culture surrounding admissions, even among students who have already matriculated. College admission is a stressful process in our culture, but it is ultimately only a means to an end. Continuing to obsessive over its intricacies without compelling reason serves little constructive purpose, and we recommend against it.
This editorial has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 22, 2016A previous version of this editorial stated that more than 100 students had viewed their admission files. In fact, the number is more than 100 students each month.

When Deng-Tung Wang ’17 tested out of his language requirement with Spanish before his freshman year, he didn’t think much about learning another language.
But two years later, he found himself sitting in a classroom with a graduate student, a Swedish preceptor, and the instructor for the three-person course: “Elementary Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian.”
“It was cool having this smaller class where you can really dissect and learn about a language with other people that I might not have engaged with,” Wang said.
This year, his last at Harvard, Wang is auditing Elementary Twi, a language spoken primarily in Ghana. He also decided to take up Beginning Swedish Language and Literature.
Wang said he’s found a supportive and personalized environment within smaller language classes, and he’s not alone. While many students flock to more popular languages like Spanish—more than 100 students are currently enrolled in Beginning Spanish I—others navigate Harvard’s myriad offerings in smaller languages, from Afrikaans to Yiddish.
Although these language classes differ significantly, they have a few characteristics in common. They are more sporadically offered and sometimes require a specific student request, provide a unique learning environment due to their small size, and often must cope with a variation in levels of experience among students.
Within the classrooms of Harvard’s smallest language classes, a wide mix of people—native speakers and beginning learners, College freshmen and fifth-year graduate students, researchers and linguaphiles—work to grasp the unfamiliar sounds and systems of a language that few of their classmates will ever understand.
PETITIONING A PATH
When Kyle Shernuk, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the East Asian Languages and Civilizations department, arrived at Harvard, he was eager to begin taking Taiwanese. But Shernuk said Harvard did not offer any Taiwanese classes at the time, and he thought he did not have any other options.
But what he didn’t know then was that he could, in fact, take a Taiwanese class—if he had petitioned to do so. If a student requests a language class and their request is approved by the Office of Undergraduate Education, they can take a tutorial in the course, provided that a department can find an instructor. The process is, by nature, decentralized and not well-known.
Interested students, though, cannot simply ask to take any language course and have that request granted. The student must demonstrate an academic need for the language, according to Carolyn Choong, language program coordinator for  East Asian Languages and Civilizations.
“A lot of students will say I have a background, or my family’s from Cambodia and I want to learn the language, but that’s not enough for it to be approved,” she said.
Shernuk did end up successfully petitioning to study Taiwanese, which is relevant to his dissertation. Indeed, research is a common academic justification for petitioning a course, Choong said.
“My general focus is on contemporary or modern and contemporary Chinese literature, and I want to investigate non-traditional ways of thinking about what it means to be Chinese,” Shernuk said.
Shernuk also successfully petitioned for Colloquial Tibetan on the grounds of his research, and is currently the only student formally enrolled in the class, taught by teaching assistant Shoko Mekata from the department of South Asian Studies.
While Shernuk said he is not confident he will be able to continue his Taiwanese education at Harvard, he understands why it is not regularly offered: Compared to other languages in the region, it’s not widely spoken.
Agnes Broome,  a Swedish preceptor and the language coordinator for Scandinavian languages, teaches courses that are both regularly offered and that must be petitioned.
Broome said students don’t need to formally request to take her beginning and intermediate Swedish classes. In her Advanced Swedish class, which is  petition-only, Broome said she tries to tailor her material to the personal academic needs of her four advanced students.
She said she thinks Harvard’s petition system is an effective middle ground between offering students the language classes they want and being reasonable about the amount of resources they can expend.
“There’s clearly a goal from Harvard to offer languages that meet students’ needs and not hinder what they want to pursue, but at the same time, there is no way you can just let anyone take any language because there’s 6,000 languages,” Broome said. “It would be unviable.”
Even if a student’s petition is approved, the University cannot guarantee an instructor. Both Wang and Broome took Elementary Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian last year, but they cannot continue this semester because their instructor’s contract ended, Wang said.
Besides petitioning courses, students have also taken up activism as a way to introduce new language offerings at Harvard. This semester, after several years of student advocacy, the College reintroduced American Sign Language into its course offerings for the first time in more than 20 years.
‘WE LEARN FROM YOU, YOU LEARN FROM US’
Students in low enrollment language classes tend to have a wide range of experiences. They can also come from across Harvard’s schools.
Cooper Bryan ’19 grew up in Ethiopia and speaks Amharic fluently. However, he completed all his secondary school work in English and never learned to read and write in Amharic. That’s why he is currently taking Intermediate Amharic alongside one other native speaker and two students who began learning the language  last year.
“It’s kind of, ‘We learn from you, you learn from us, let’s take advantage of each other’s advantages,’” he said. “It’s a lot more teamwork in a classroom where I’m trying to write my name, and I lean over to the kid next to me who doesn’t speak Amharic but can write it.”
Bryan said he feels much closer to his Amharic instructor, Mulugeta H. Zegeye, than to professors in his other classes. He hadn’t planned to take Amharic, but the instructor convinced him to take the class after they met at an open house hosted by the African Language Program.
“He guilted me into it a little bit, but it’s the best choice I’ve made in a long time,” Bryan said.
While students in these small classes benefit from personalized instruction and a close relationship with their teachers, students can’t sit in the back of the classroom without participating. This can be both stressful and helpful for learning the language.
“You can’t slack off which is great,” said Pamela Nwakanma, a Government student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who takes the Rwandan language Kinyarwanda. “You have to be kind of forced to do the homework, to ask questions, to be involved.”
WHY THAT LANGUAGE?
With the dozens of languages students can access at Harvard, the decision on what ultimately to take is a personal one. Students who decide to petition a language course often do so for research, but other students say they want to learn about other cultures.
Broome said that she always asks her students why they want to take Swedish. Their answers vary; some, for example, say they have Swedish friends who inspired them to take her courses, while others say they like swing dance, which is popular in Sweden.
“I say to my students that it makes complete sense at Harvard to do a weird language,” she said.
For some students, learning a language off-the-beaten-path is a way to reconnect with a culture. Bryan said he wants to make sure he remains fluent in Amharic and involved with an Ethiopian community because his family, who is American, recently moved from Ethiopia back to the United States.
“I think the Ethiopian culture and the people are so incredibly diverse and generous and hospitable and beautiful and that makes Amharic a lot of fun,” he said.
Ayush Midha ’19 said he wanted to learn more about East Africa after visiting Tanzania in high school,  and chose to start Swahili as a freshman in college. He is now a course assistant for Elementary Swahili, and said his interest in the language intensified after he spent last summer in Kenya.
“I think in general students have a very limited exposure to African culture and in particular East African culture because it’s not really discussed in most history classes,” he said.
For students like Wang, learning a rare language is simply capitalizing on a unique opportunity.
“Where am I going to get decent Twi education outside of Harvard, right?"

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, flocks of eager students attended the Office of Career Service’s Big Data Analytics & Technology Fair, crowding around tables with representatives from Google and Facebook.
The popularity of the career fair—it attracted more than 1,000 interested guests on Facebook—makes apparent the significant rise in the number of Harvard students pursuing careers in the technology sector. The number of students going into tech or engineering from the College has tripled over the last five years.
“More people are interested in going into tech,” Director of OCS Robin Mount said. “Part of the reason why I think we’re seeing such growth is the increase in enrollment in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Computer science and applied math are concentrations that have been growing.”
According to data provided by OCS, the percentage of Harvard College graduates pursuing careers in technology or engineering has grown from 4 percent in 2011 to 12 percent in 2016; those careers are now the third most popular immediate post graduate pursuit. Technology and engineering falls just behind financial services at 14 percent and full-time graduate or professional school at 15 percent.
Mount noted that, rather than being supplanted by technology firms, the financial industry similarly is beginning to use more data in its work.
“Finance wants tech people also... They see themselves as a technology company because they’re working off of trading platforms and things like that,” Mount said. “So I think there’s just more options for students that have those skills.”
But it is not just the finance and tech sectors that seek to hire students with skills in data analytics or computer science. OCS has seen an increase in demand for those skills in nearly every industry, Mount said. At the OCS data and tech fair, traditional powerhouse tech firms like Microsoft vied for students’ interest alongside firms from other industries. The pharmaceutical company Johnson and Johnson and the basketball team the Boston Celtics were also in attendance.
“The biggest growth we’ve seen is the trend in big data. Analyzing data is of particular interest to companies in just about every sector, whether it’s healthcare, global health, education, marketing, finance—any one of those things, because data is the new kind of—what would you call it?” Mount said, searching for the term.
“Bacon,”Associate Director of Employer Relations and Operations Deborah Carroll interjected.
Data has become the “new bacon” in more ways than one. With companies seeking more employees with strong data analytics skills, jobs in tech have become lucrative.
“A bunch of my blockmates in college, or a lot of them, tried to do other things and they all inevitably moved back into tech, or at least more quantitative sort of, computer-based fields, either research or tech,” Timothy Barry-Heffernan ’14, who attended the fair as a recruiter for Google, said. “It’s where all the money is.”
There is certainly money in technology for recent graduates. According to The Crimson’s annual senior survey for the Class of 2015 , 47 percent of respondents reporting they would make $110,000 or more after graduation were computer science concentrators.
Both recruiters and students are enthusiastic about the new movement toward tech. Javier Cuan-Martinez ’18, a computer science concentrator, said the growth in the technology industry has benefited not only students seeking jobs but also consumers in general.
“The thing that I love about computer science is that you solve problems that people don’t know are problems,” Cuan-Martinez said. “For example, with Uber, no one really thought, ‘Oh, man, I have to find a taxi now, I need a ride.’ But Uber came along, found the problem, and it’s solved now. It’s great, computer science. You get to make things more efficient around the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Mary T.W. Robinson, a former president of Ireland and current United Nations Special Envoy on El Niño and Climate, spoke about widespread human displacement due to climate change at a discussion at Harvard Law School on Thursday evening.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow moderated the discussion in front of a packed audience. “There is nobody on earth who is more involved, who has done more on the subjects that bring us here today,” Minow said when introducing Robinson.
Robinson has previously served as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Climate Change. She is also president of the Mary Robinson Foundation—Climate Justice.
During the conversation, Robinson emphasized the need for international policies promoting sustainability, especially given the increasing vulnerability of millions of people living close to sea level. The discussion included an examination of empirical data and observations regarding the effects of climate change, as well as the suggesting of proposals for effective policy responses.
Robinson focused on the connection between climate change and human rights in developing countries. She argued there should be more efficient contributions from the international community for those most affected by climate change.
“That’s the vulnerability of parts of the world, and unfortunately they happen oftentimes to be the poorest parts, which is a crime of justice,” she said. “These are the people who lose their livelihoods, who can’t get water for their families… and yet they don’t drive cars, they don’t have air conditioning, they don’t contribute.”
The audience reacted positively to Robinson, who received lengthy applause at the end of the discussion.
“The piece that really stood out to me was the need for us to most recognize the problem, but to think about it in a way that is proactive so that we are doing things that are active,” clinical professor of law Tyler R. Giannini said.
Renzo R. Guinto, a student at the School of Public Health, said that, as a physician, he is concerned about climate change partly due to the deleterious health effects of disaster-induced displacement.
“I come from the Phillipines, and so… I can very much relate to what she was talking about,” he said. “We are already seeing the health impact of climate change, especially to people who are displaced.”

Theater Dance Media, a new student-produced magazine focusing on design and performing arts at Harvard, debuted this week as its student staff members seek to establish an official student organization.
Nine Theater, Dance, and Media concentrators, who began working on the project in the spring, produced the inaugural edition. Since the project’s inception last year, the group solicited student work ranging from photographs to academic papers to excerpts of plays. Eleven students from a range of concentrations, as well as some recent graduates, contributed work to the first issue.
Sam A. Hagen ’18, a TDM concentrator and the magazine’s editor-in-chief, said he hopes the magazine can provide a more concrete way to present student work to students, faculty, alumni, and others interested in the performing arts at Harvard.
“If you pick up this magazine, each semester you will know what is going on in Harvard Theater, Dance, and Media—whether that is performances that are happening or happened, whether that’s what papers people are writing, what designs people are making, what plays they’re writing,” Hagen said.
The 64-page magazine features interviews with Theater, Dance, and Media department faculty, including Dance Director and Senior Lecturer Jill Johnson and Daniel Kramer, the artistic director of the English National Opera, who is teaching a course this semester as well as directing the concentration’s fall production “A Dream Play.”
The magazine’s designer, Sarah K. Grammar ’18, explained that the magazine currently receives funding through a combination of advertising revenue from campus performance groups and TDM departmental support. She and Hagen said they want the magazine to become financially independent from the department, however.
While the magazine’s staff for the first issue consists of solely TDM concentrators, Hagen and Grammar said they hope that students from outside of the department will become involved in its production in the future.
“We want it to be a really inclusive staff experience,” Grammar said. “The vision I think of the staff structure from here on out is that a TDM concentrator, an English concentrator, and a science concentrator all have an equal chance to one day potentially be the editor-in-chief.”
The students behind the publication have taken other steps to solidify the magazine’s presence on campus. Hagen said they have applied to the Office of Student Life to be recognized as an official organization, and are currently awaiting that decision. Having a dedicated space to work and greater control over finances would allow the staff to publish more material and distribute the magazine more widely, according to Hagen.
In addition, the group intends to digitize the publication for greater accessibility to a wider readership. However, the magazine’s staff has not yet decided on a format for the publication’s online presence.
“We want to be online, because people read things that they see shared on Facebook,” Hagen said. “Students create so much good work here, and up until before this magazine... a lot of the designs, and the papers, and the plays that people wrote, not enough people were seeing that stuff.”
TDM Director of Studies Deborah D. Foster praised the magazine and the students behind it. She also expressed her own hopes that the magazine will expand to include more people on campus.
“I think that it has the potential, I hope, to involve the other concentrators and students involved in Theater, Dance, and Media at Harvard to come together and think creatively about what we are trying to do in Theater, Dance, and Media and in the other art-making entities at Harvard,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ohio State University Law professor Edward B. Foley discussed his new book, “Ballot Battles: The History of Disputed Elections in the United States,” at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation on Thursday. He presented his findings on disputed elections throughout history and advocated for concrete legal measures to prevent future controversies.
Referencing the final U.S. presidential debate that took place Wednesday night, Foley began his talk by drawing a parallel between the current election and the 1876 presidential election, in which a divided Congress disagreed on the vote count days before the inauguration.
Foley attributed the “passive voice” in the 12th Amendment as cause for dispute in U.S. elections. That the 12th Amendment states “the votes shall then be counted” is, he said, “the Achilles’ heel in U.S. legislation.”
“The passive voice doesn’t assign responsibility,” Foley said. “Who actually counts the votes? [The founding fathers] never thought there would be an issue about it.”
Foley noted that personal virtue and a candidate’s respect for the electoral system can often resolve the issue in highly disputed elections. In the hotly contested 1792 New York gubernatorial election between John Jay and George Clinton, Foley explained, founding father Alexander Hamilton advised Jay to concede defeat. This set a precedent: The losing candidate should concede despite personal issue with the electoral rules.
In his talk, Foley gave other examples of U.S. election disputes. Some resulted in concessions, such as Nixon’s voluntary termination of his 1960 presidential bid, while others resulted in violence, such as the assassination in 1900 of a Kentucky gubernatorial candidate.
Foley argued that non-partisan courts are the best way to resolve disputed elections.
“Courts are better than legislatures—we risk the rawest of raw partisan greed if we let legislatures rule,” Foley said. “It is up to us to create an institution that is robust enough to handle any instances where the rules aren’t perfect.”
Following Foley’s talk, several Kennedy School students asked questions about the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore ’69, as well as voiced their concerns about the current election.
“The most interesting thing to realize is how often this happened and how chaotic the process has been when it is a dire crisis,” said Seth N. Soderborg, a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student who has studied disputed elections in Indonesia and Brazil. “There isn’t a single set of rules governing both how elections are administered and who is a voter in different parts of the country.”
Foley painted a picture of short-term pragmatism and long-term optimism at the end of his talk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard announced it had agreed upon the date for a union election with graduate student union organizers, some undergraduates realized for the first time they will be involved in the process.
In addition to outlining the logistics for the Nov. 16 and 17 election—in which eligible students will vote for or against the creation of a union—the University and union organizers agreed on who will be included in the bargaining unit: graduate student teaching fellows and research assistants, as well as undergraduate teaching fellows.
“I heard about the graduate student unionization, but had no idea it would potentially involve undergrads,” Math course assistant Molly Moore ’17 said.
University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that all eligible students “will be notified directly” once the National Labor Relations Board approves the agreement between the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, the group of students behind the union effort.
Over the past month, union organizers have begun reaching out to undergraduates regarding the prospect of joining a union. Students said they have been approached in dining halls and have received emails regarding unionization.
“We go into Houses, we go into dining halls, we definitely try to reach people by email, we have a conversation over coffee—it’s basically whatever makes people feel comfortable and willing to engage in that dialogue,” Laila M. Smith ’18 said.
Smith said she is one of two undergraduate organizers for HGSU-UAW, and is a paid employee of the union effort. Smith said she was contacted by a graduate student about getting the word out to undergraduates.
One email sent by Samuel J. Potter ’20, in which he identified himself as an HGSU-UAW organizer, to a CS50 course assistant includes a link to an online authorization card that students can opt to sign. This is the method by which the National Labor Relations Board will determine if the union effort has enough support to call for the election in the first place. Since February, a majority of graduate students employed by the University have signed a card.
“Many undergraduates report feeling isolated in their work, and joining the undergraduate union allows you to meet and join in a community with your fellow workers,” the email read.
“The Undergraduate Council has yet to formally discuss unionization efforts,” UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 wrote in an email. “We'd welcome, however, conversation on how to best inform the many students voting in this election about the stakes and implications of unionization.”
Banks and some other undergraduates are opposed to unionization. Speaking from his personal opinion, Banks wrote that unionizing “would be detrimental to the educational experience of undergraduates.”
“Putting a middleman between professors and their mentees, that wedge being United Auto Workers, degrades the concept of mentorship so pivotal to academic life,” Banks wrote. “While I trust Teaching Fellows and others to make the judgement call and respect their right to unionize, the deleterious effects of student unionization weigh too heavily in my mind to support this effort.”
Moore said while she has not yet fully decided how to vote, she is leaning toward voting against unionization. Her primary concern, she said, is that the work students do across departments is too different to be adequately represented by a union, and that while beneficial in some settings, she believes a union could “potentially hurt our jobs” at Harvard.
Graduate students have raised a similar concern—that departmental needs vary too widely to be represented by a single union—at an information session organized by union advocates earlier in the semester. At the event, HGSU-UAW spokesperson and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis said a contract could be detailed and tailored enough to reflect widespread concerns, and that this has been done at public universities where unions are present.
Math course assistant Shira Li ’19 and Economics teaching fellow Daniel H. Nightingale ’18 are both unsure of whether or not they will vote, and said the stakes are not as high for undergraduates.
“I don’t really feel like this affects me that much—I mean I’m pretty content with the way that things are right now,” Nightingale said. “I mean I’m not a grad student; I don’t have to live off of the wages I get. I don’t have as many responsibilities as they do.”
Smith said her work revolves around spreading information to students, since many, she said, are “unfamiliar” with unionization. Most students she spoke with, she said, have been receptive and have signed authorization cards.
“A majority of all the conversations that I’ve had—a majority of people signed on right there and then. I think people are supportive and they get it,” she said.
UC Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18 wrote in an email that his committee is looking into unionization.
“We are excited undergraduates are being included in the voting, and we look forward to hearing more from the broader student body over the next few weeks before the vote,” Ely wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s student-athletes depend on the University’s dining services to fuel them during practices and on game day.
But with dining workers on strike and consequent alterations to many menus, some athletes are concerned about their nutrition and diets—elements that can be crucial to their performance.
Grilled chicken and eggs are key sources of protein for many athletes, and both are normally available from dining hall grills. However, with grills shuttered during the strike, some athletes have voiced concerns about finding enough protein to eat.
Weisner Perez ’19, who plays on the men’s basketball team, said the grills “provide a certain amount of protein that I feel is essential for me to perform at a higher level.” With House grills closed during the strike, Perez said he has not been eating as healthy a diet as he normally would. He has heard teammates voice similar concerns.
Hollis E. Jomo ’18, who plays on the women’s water polo team, said the protein alternatives being provided have not been as healthy as they usually are.
“[It has] become a lot more difficult to get substantial protein,” Jomo said. “Usually I’ll rely on grilled chicken from the grill, or eggs or something, but right now a lot of the proteins have a lot of other things mixed in with them. They are not very healthy options.”
Radcliffe heavyweight crew coach Liz O’Leary also noted lack of protein as an issue, and said her team has tried to supplement athletes’ diets a few times during the strike by hosting team dinners in the boathouse.
“The athletes, though, have a pretty clear diet that they’re looking for in terms of protein, and I think the lack of protein has been the biggest concern for them,” O’Leary said. “From a performance perspective, if you don’t have a healthy well-balanced diet, it eventually is detrimental to what you are trying to do as an athlete.”
Not every team is supplementing players’ diets. Perez said that while his coaches occasionally order food for the team when they have late night practices, they have not taken any additional measures to supplement food during the strike.
Dining workers have been on strike for more than two weeks, picketing across Harvard’s campus. As a result, the University has closed several dining halls and cafes; currently, only eight dining halls are open, including Annenberg Hall, which remains open only for freshmen.
Harvard University Health Services Sports Dietitian Meg S. Schrier said that part of her job involves meeting weekly with HUDS to review how athletes are being fed. She acknowledged that the strike has caused students to modify their diets.
“Navigating the dining options during the strike requires some changes in habits, such as relying on the grill, but all the necessary components to good fueling are available,” Schrier wrote in an email statement provided by Harvard University Health Services spokesperson Lindsey Baker.
Schrier also said she has been working with HUDS to make adjustments based on concerns raised by student-athletes.
“These adjustments include adding more slow-digesting carbohydrates and lean proteins, and working with HUDS to add more fruit and vegetable options at meals,” Schrier wrote.
Indeed, HUDS has been changing and updating its menus throughout the strike.
An email from HUDS sent Wednesday updating undergraduates on the modified dining arrangements said administrators “have received lots of great feedback which is helping us meet your needs during the current work stoppage.” The email also highlighted that HUDS was providing “a range of lean proteins” at the salad bar, such as grilled chicken and beans.
And after HUDS modified usual dining hall hours, an email obtained by The Crimson containing information from the Harvard Athletics Department was sent this week to student-athletes alerting them that Dunster would start extending its closing time from 7:15 p.m. to 8 p.m. The email noted this was not advertised to the rest of the college, and also recommended athletes supplement their diets with boxed meals.
While athletes may be feeling the impact of the strike more directly than most students, O’Leary said changes to food offerings have not been affecting student-athletes more than students in general.
“Of course it’s had an effect on the athletes, but I don’t think any more so than the rest of the student population,” O’Leary said.
O’Leary also noted that, while it was concerning that diet changes could impact performance, she was confident current dining managers and staff were working as hard as they could.
“I know it’s not an ideal situation at all, and we’re just doing our best to help the athletes know what their options are and when we need to supplement, we are,” O’Leary said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and administrators at the School of Public Health say there has been a more concerted focus on issues of diversity in the last few years, notably in the form of more school-wide discussions and concrete initiatives.
Last month, HSPH held a town hall event in which administrators outlined steps they are taking to improve diversity and inclusion efforts. Among the initiatives are a new online bias-reporting system, training programs regarding implicit bias, and a greater emphasis on increasing diversity among students and faculty.
Associate Dean for Diversity Meredith B. Rosenthal said roughly 18 percent of domestic students at HSPH are underrepresented minorities, ranking higher than the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, but behind the College.
Rosenthal said student activism at HSPH, as well as national activism in response to the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, played a role in bringing issues of diversity to the forefront.
HSPH’s first town hall on these issues came out of the aftermath of the events in Ferguson, Rosenthal said.
“That first town hall was really brought together by students who wanted to hear from the administration what we were going to do to address injustice on our own campus, and also to have a voice, a leadership role, in the community and in the nation,” she said.
Several HSPH students said there have been many concrete changes over the years. Yvette Efevbera is a Public Health student who worked with a student group in 2010 that sought the creation of a school-wide committee of faculty and students. She said that, three years later, the HSPH Dean’s Advisory Committee on Diversity and Inclusion was created.
Rosenthal added that HSPH has built up its “pipeline programs” in the past few year—programs designed to reduce barriers and encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue a graduate education in public health.
“I think they have been listening to students demands,” Jaquelyn Jahn, an HSPH student and chair of the Dean Advisory Committee’s Student Voices subcommittee, said. She cited the town hall meetings as evidence of HSPH’s progress.
At the committee’s request last year, the school hired an independent group to hold a campus climate survey, Rosenthal said. The survey found that nearly half—44.7 percent—of black or African American respondents said they “strongly disagree” with the statement “I trust the school’s leadership to meaningfully address inequities on campus.” For white respondents, only 24.9 percent answered the same way.
“Now we actually have evidence of some of the challenges,” Efevbera said.
Students also said they were pleased with the selection of an African American female, Michelle A. Williams, as the School’s dean—the first African American female head of a Harvard faculty. Efevbera, an African American, said she was “inspired” by Williams’s qualifications and success, but believes the work does not end with the selection of an African American dean.
“I really think these challenges are a result of structures and systems that are in place, not just a single person,” Efevbera said.
Moving forward, students said they wanted to see policies that address classroom microaggressions, a mandatory implicit bias seminar for instructors, and increased diversity in the student body and tenured faculty.
“I think the school is making significant progress, but that it has a ways to go,” Jahn said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every morning since Oct. 6, one of Harvard’s catering workers has descended into the tunnels beneath undergraduate dining halls to get to work. He does not want to be seen.
The employee, who has reported to work since the second day of the dining workers’ unprecedented strike, asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union representing Harvard’s dining workers in their current contract negotiations with the University. He has chosen to cross the picket lines each day because he believes the benefits that workers currently receive, in addition to the wage and health plans Harvard has proposed during the negotiations, are competitive in the food services industry. He also said he does not believe the union has properly communicated details about the progress of the negotiations, which have gone on for four months. 
This employee is one of a small number who have, during the course of the more than two-week long strike, avoided the crowds of marching dining hall staff and have resumed work in Harvard dining facilities. The vast majority of HUDS employees support the strike—workers voted 591-18 in favor of authorizing the strike in a ballot last month.
Fourteen HUDS workers have crossed the picket line and returned to work, according to an email from College Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba, forwarded over the Lowell House open list by Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck.
Since May, Harvard and Local 26 have engaged in tense negotiations focusing primarily on wages and health benefits. Local 26 has asked the University for guaranteed summer work for interested employees, and a $35,000 "minimum guaranteed" annual salary for those employees. In addition, the union has asked that Harvard keep dining workers' current health plan in place next year. Harvard initially proposed a health plan—which would increase copayments, cut deductibles, and create a new premium contribution tier—identical to the one negotiated by its largest union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, last winter.
Over the course of negotiations, Harvard has also offered to contribute the “equivalent cost of the Harvard University Group Health Plan enrollment premium” to a health care plan the union offers in-house. The University also offered a series of “summer stipends” that would pay HUDS workers between $150 to $250 weekly to be available to work during the summer, regardless of whether they actually work a shift. Local 26 has rejected these offers.
HUDS workers’ personal situations and experiences—whether they are single or have families, whether they have ongoing health concerns or live in particularly expensive areas of Boston—shape how they view the ongoing strike. Picketing HUDS employee Laquiesha N. Rainey, for example, has the chronic disease lupus, which requires regular and extensive visits to specialists; copay increases could affect her more than others without a chronic illness. She also has a two-year-old daughter for whom she must provide.
But some employees—the few who have chosen not to picket—say the wages and health care proposals Harvard has put forward would keep their personal situations stable. The HUDS worker who uses the tunnels to get to work does not have dependents and makes $24.36 per hour—above the average the University reports for HUDS workers.
Larry E. Houston, a general cook who stopped striking and began reporting to Annenberg on Oct. 11—about a week after the strike began—said he thinks the wages HUDS workers currently receive are sustainable. Houston makes between $24 and $25 per hour, is single, and does not have any dependents.
“We get a pretty good deal,” Houston said. “And you can plan ahead to save money for the months where we’re not employed. You must make plans.”
On healthcare, while Houston said he would much rather keep the benefits he has now, he is not opposed to signing up for the open enrollment coverage plan Harvard has offered for 2017.
A week after the strike began, Houston became frustrated with the union and returned to work, where he says he has worked overtime as he fills in for workers who are still out on the picket lines. Local 26 pays picketing HUDS employees $40 per day. According to Local 26 president Brian Lang, the union will distribute its next payment of strike benefits on Friday.
Local 26 also launched a “strike assistance” fund last week that has garnered more than 500 donations, and the union has also received food from faculty members and students organizations, including the First Generation Student Union.
Houston also said he did not like the picketing methods strikers have employed. Specifically, he said he took issue with a dance party the union hosted in the Science Center Plaza on its third day of the strike.
“What kind of message are we sending?” Houston, who at the time had still been picketing, said. “A message that we aren’t serious about what we’re doing.”
A third worker, Gilda S. Correia, who works at the Harvard Kennedy School, criticized Local 26 in a video distributed to some HUDS workers, expressing dismay that the strike has persisted as long as it has.
“The union was supposed to be fighting for us,” Correia, who did not respond to requests for comment, said in the video. “If we’re paying them, they should be sitting there and doing the job, fighting for us.”
Lang wrote in an emailed statement, provided by Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck, that he hopes any employees who have returned to work will join the picket lines.
“A very small number of workers have chosen to return to work. We hope they will join us on the lines again soon and encourage them to do so,”  Lang wrote. “We believe that the extraordinary display of resolve and unity by the Harvard dining services strikers will win us a fair resolution to the strike.”
He added that “[w]hile Harvard has slowly moved in our direction during our discussions, our core issues remain unresolved.”

Coaching was never the plan for Jesse Foglia. Initially the job was just a step towards his ultimate goal: becoming an educator.
“I knew pretty young that I wanted to get into education—I was very determined that I wanted to be a teacher,” Foglia said. “Originally, I thought of coaching as a great way to get a teaching job, showing that I’d worked with that age group of people.”
But all that barking out orders, correcting form, and setting training schedules had an allure of its own. Over 10 years after starting as a coach, Foglia has found his classroom in the boathouse.
He has spent eight years coaching the US Men’s Junior National team, coordinated recruiting for Bates College, and led Columbia’s lightweight men’s team to some of its most successful seasons. Now, in 2016, Foglia brings a fresh perspective and a deep understanding of rowing to Harvard as the new assistant coach for the men’s heavyweight team.
“The longer I coached, the more I realized that I was teaching, but in a different classroom than the traditional setting,” Foglia continued. “And that’s what drew coaching to me. I really loved this opportunity to actually teach people something they wanted to do.”
Foglia’s passion for education, as seen in his early ambition to become a teacher, has played a critical role in his transition into Harvard rowing. In just the month since the start of the season, Foglia has helped the team implement an individualized training program that pinpoints the strengths and weaknesses of each rower.
Foglia used a similar method at Columbia. Like every other college program, the Lions employed a smattering of exercises, including minute intervals, 5K races, and the maximum watt test.
Foglia’s innovation was to design a method that compared each rower’s performance to what would be a gold standard. In this way the coach could identify specific areas of improvement and allow athletes to focus on areas of weakness in practice. And the same philosophy has carried over to Harvard.
“We were talking about how to make our training plan more individualized,” heavyweight captain Chase Buchholz said. “Using data to gain insight into individual performance was a novel approach for us, and Jesse was able to create a program that reflects the individual needs of a rower.”
Foglia’s methods have been effective, even so early on in the season. The team performed well at the Head of the Housatonic earlier this month, with boats earning top finishes in all events.
But Foglia attributes the ease of his transition to the receptiveness of his fellow coaches.
“It’s been absolutely phenomenal,” Foglia said. “Head Coach Charley Butt and assistant coach Patrick Lapange—almost from day one they were willing to pass off roles and responsibilities pretty openly and freely.”
Foglia has earned the right to responsibility thanks to an impressive track record. Before coming to Harvard, Foglia spent the past three years turning the Columbia Lions from the unnoticed underdogs, never having won a national championship, to a major player in college rowing. Under his leadership, the Lions earned the IRA National Championship and team points championship in 2014.
Foglia’s coaching career began even before he had graduated from college. In 2015 he spent some time at Fox Chapel High School as the men’s varsity coach.
Four years after that, he graduated from Duquesne University. His major? Education.
“Jesse’s trained as a teacher,” Buchholz said. “He’s a very clear teacher, and that really complements the strengths of our other coaches. We’re have done more work as a team at this point in the fall than I have seen before.”
One of the central challenges of coaching crew is familiar to any teacher—balancing collective success with individual improvement. Just as it’s inappropriate to focus on one person alone, it’s inappropriate to ignore individual differences.
Yet the most public challenge is still to come. Every year the Head of the Charles draws masses of strangers—each excited to watch solid competition and, presumably, each ready to judge any shortcomings.
Already Foglia feels a sense of gravity.
“When you walk into the boathouse here, you realize that you’re a very small piece of something that is incredibly large and historic,” Foglia said. “You feel privileged to just be a small part of it. From my standpoint, coming here there’s definitely a much clearer expectation of excellence.”
Off the water, this fact translates to a high level of team bonding. And as Buchholz made clear, Foglia has become an appreciated part of the program.
“We absolutely love Jesse,” Buchholz said. “We were really pleasantly surprised how seamless Jesse has slotted into our program and adopted our culture.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rowing is a characteristically tight-knit sport.  Many outsiders would likely describe its participants as individuals who enjoy waking up before the sun rises and subjugating themselves to excruciatingly painful workouts.
However, there is something more to rowing that makes its athletes tick and keeps them coming back to the sport.  Rowing is a sport that cultivates values that are inherently linked to its nature, such as diligence, patience, and camaraderie.  Additionally, within the confines of this unique culture, there are certain figures that stick out above the others, truly embodying these values.
Entering her fourth year at Harvard with the Radcliffe varsity heavyweight team, co-captain Abigail Parker has distinguished herself as an exceptional athlete and person. With distinction both on and off the water, Parker stands as a unique person who will be a great leader for her team in the coming season and will undoubtedly be remembered fondly after she graduates.
“Coming in freshman year it was obvious that Abba [Parker] was passionate and determined when it came to rowing,” said fellow co-captain Isabella Benduski. “As the years have passed, I have seen her bring out that passion and determination in her teammates.”
While rowing is a sport to which athletes often have a late introduction, Parker had a unique and perhaps unparalleled exposure to it from an early age.  Her father, Harry Parker, often referred to devoutly as the “God” of rowing, coached the Harvard heavyweight men’s team from 1963 until 2013.  During his time at the helm, the heavyweights achieved an unprecedented winning record that trumps that of almost any successful college coach across all sports.
By nurturing his athletes to perform at their very best, Harry Parker fostered a culture of determination in his Crimson crews that resulted in nine official national championships, 22 undefeated seasons and a whopping 44-7 record at the Harvard-Yale regatta.  Parker also had rowed in the single sculls event at the 1960 Olympics in Rome and coached six men’s and women’s Olympic crews, three of which ended up in the medals.
In addition to her Olympic father, Parker’s mom, Kathy Keeler, is an Olympic champion herself. Keeler was a member of the 1984 gold medal-winning women’s eights event.
Needless to say, Parker was destined to grow up with rowing as an important part of her everyday life.
In June 2013, the summer before Abigail would take up her oar at Harvard, her father tragically succumbed to myelodysplastic disorder, a blood cancer stemming from the bone marrow.  His departure left a massive void in the Harvard program and left the rowing community at large at a loss.
Nevertheless, Abigail Parker arrived on campus in the fall determined to honor her father’s legacy by working optimally both on and off the water.
“Abba has always been a committed and reliable teammate. From day one of freshman year she has given rowing everything she has,” senior teammate Victoria Basedow said.  “As she has become a senior member of the team this attitude has set a high standard for underclassmen to aspire to.”
In her freshman year rowing for Radcliffe, Parker earned a spot in the second varsity eight as well as the varsity four.  She helped the team to a 12-4 regular season record in her respective boats and assisted the Black and White to a fourth place finish in the Varsity Four event at the Ivy League Championships.
During her sophomore year, Parker stepped up her game on the water even more, competing again in the second varsity eight and eventually earning a spot in the varsity eight.  While the season had its share of highs and lows for the Radcliffe rowers, Parker’s eight boat still managed to pull off a fourth place finish in the grand final at the Ivy League Championships.
Most recently, in the 2015-2016 season, her junior year, Parker maintained her spot in the varsity eight, sitting bow and four-seat in the boat throughout the regular season.  At the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC) Sprints, Parker successfully led her boat to a first place finish.
“Abba was one of my first friends on the team. I’ll always remember her being there for me during freshman fall when I needed a friend in Annenberg,” said Basedow. “In addition, Abba’s pure love for the sport will not be forgotten by younger rowers on the team. This unique and pure dedication will be her legacy.”
Parker’s passion for the sport has led her to compete separately from the team as well, both in single and doubles sculling with the Charles River Scullers. Parker finished second in the 2016 U23 World Trials doubles race after finishing third in the 2015 rendition of the U23 World singles. Parker also won the Collegiate Small Challenge in the singles event last fall while representing the Black and White.
While her rowing accomplishments are indicative of her athletic ability, Parker’s academic achievements are equally noteworthy.
Following her freshman year at Harvard, Parker was awarded the Detur Book Prize.  From the Latin phrase—detur digniori—meaning, “to the more worthy, let it be given,” this historic accolade is reserved for students at Harvard who maintain a perfect GPA during their first year of college. By keeping up such a remarkable academic track record, Parker displayed that she does not leave her work ethic at the boathouse.
In her sophomore year, Parker declared her concentration in Integrative Biology, an area in which she would continue to excel.  She thrived academically throughout the year and into her junior year.  In the spring of junior year, she was inducted as one of only 24 juniors into the venerable Phi Beta Kappa honors society.
“As much passion as Abba has for rowing she also has for everything else she does,” said Benduski.  “I believe all of the young rowers on our team look up to her and admire her commitment to all of her endeavors.”
Now, in the midst of her senior year, Abigail Parker looks to keep improving in the spheres of rowing and academia, where she has already attained such widespread success.  With preparations for the 52nd Head of the Charles already underway, the Radcliffe rowers look to put up a fast time on its very own whirlwind 5 km home course.
For Parker, in what will be her ultimate Head of the Charles donning the Black and White as an undergrad, this race will be especially meaningful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Head of the Charles got its start because George Ernest Arlett wasn’t a gentleman.
Arlett was born in England and practically grew up in a boathouse. He was a promising young talent and his career could have taken off if he wasn’t considered a commoner. English boat clubs only extended membership to “gentlemen” who did not have to work to sustain themselves. Instead Arlett settled as the club’s boatman, sitting tantalizingly close to the boats he could never row while his career wasted away, unfounded.
Arlett then transitioned to coaching, which brought him to Boston where he was tasked with starting a rowing program at Northeastern. Before his time there, he was the boatman at the Cambridge Boat Club. He came up with the idea for the regatta on the Charles River and consulted co-founders D’Arcy MacMahon, Howard McIntyre, and Jack Vincent. The regatta was seen by these members as an opportunity to provide a break from fall training and spring season preparation.
Whether by direct motivation or by incredible circumstance, the Head of the Charles perfectly befits Arlett’s misgivings about English rowing culture that he escaped. The Head of the Charles has become a monster.
Annually, it attracts nearly 400,000 spectators to the Charles to take in the event, which happens to be the largest two-day regatta in the world. The Boston Marathon is the only event draws more people into Boston. The Head of the Charles now attracts fans and rowers from around the world. This year’s race will also include a slew of athletes who competed in the Rio Olympics this past summer.
“It’s really exciting to have all these people who might not be familiar with rowing, watching and cheering,” junior heavyweight rower Kelsey Barolak said. “It’s super exciting to row down the course for 15 minutes and have someone there every single step of the way, cheering you on.”
The Head of the Charles regatta, like most others, had humble beginnings. When the regatta started in 1965, most of the teams that participated were based in the Boston area. The inaugural regatta featured 268 rowers in 80 boats participating in 12 different events. Now, 51 years later, 2,257 boats, 821 teams, and 10,600 rowers are scheduled to race on the Charles this coming weekend. It is easy to be impressed at the numbers, but harder to understand their meaning.
Other world-class regattas, particularly in Europe, dwarf the Head of the Charles when it comes to history. The Chester Regatta first broke water in 1733, making it the oldest rowing regatta in the world. Comparatively, the quick growth of both its reputation and racing lineup is unprecedented in the world of rowing.
The regatta’s participation numbers have grown almost every single year, along with the inclusion of new rowers from around the world. The Head of the Charles is unique in its wide-ranging participation. Divisions of racing extend from the high school to Olympic club level. A complete novice can be rowing in his or her first regatta just before a world champion rows in their wake.
“It’s really sort of a cross-section of the sport, as well as a huge celebration,” senior heavyweight rower Abigail Parker said.
Other major regattas are smaller because they focus on a specific competition level, such as college teams. The Head of the Charles has a special spirit—one of inclusion. Even the first regatta in 1965 included junior and “veterans” races, along with the typical college racing. Since then, the racing has opened up to divisions of youth, masters, and even competitors with disabilities who will row out of boathouses along the length of the Charles.
“For [Harvard rowing], the Head of the Charles is exciting and important, but not our main competition,” Barolak said. “For me, what I find most exciting about the Head of the Charles is the opportunity to race these crews we might not have the opportunity to in the spring.”
The most significant change came in 1997, when the regatta expanded to a weekend-long affair. The primary motivation was not more racing, but increased logistical and financial security after the 1996 race was cancelled because of a ‘100-Year Storm.’ Nevertheless, the two-day regatta allows for a better spectator experience. There are more events over a longer timespan, incentivizing fans to fly into Boston in order to enjoy a weekends worth of festivities.
The Head of the Charles is as much of a regatta for rowers as it is a celebration of rowing. Many classes of rowers hold reunions and different rowing clubs network in order to bring as many members and alumni to Cambridge over the course of the weekend.
The allure of the banks and bridges of the Charles River combined with rowers of all ages and origins draw in even the most casual of spectators. The people and scenery aren’t the only things that pull people to the regatta. The racing is exciting.
“There are a lot of turns… and it can get pretty fun as somebody can come up from behind and pass a boat,” Parker said. “There will be three boats across trying to go through and a bridge and you end up getting crashes”
The weekend begins with master races and youth races. They look to navigate the windy rivers, and cheer their rowing heroes later in the afternoon. In recent years, there have been elite racers that combine to form Great Eights in champion events. Combining multiple Olympic medalists, world champions, and rowing legends into one boat can be quite exciting as they gracefully glide through the glistening water. But perhaps more exciting is watching the fight of elite collegiate programs such as Harvard’s men heavyweights, just six seconds behind a Great Eight team in 2014, as they try to pull off historic upsets.
For the Head of the Charles, it seems that bigger is, in fact, better. Despite financial challenges in the regatta’s resulting from rapid growth, strong leadership from organizers such as Treasurer and Race Organizer Ed Smith have allowed the regatta to flourish. Sponsors such as IBM, who Smith secured, and BNY Mellon have allowed for a larger operation than would just entry fees. As the years have passed, tha banks of the river have become more populated with company tents. Every October, rowers have a chance to love the sport of rowing and the Cambridge community has the opportunity to experience the traditional act of enjoying a regatta by the river.
As spectators and participants pile into Cambridge and Boston this weekend, the future of the Head of the Charles looks bright. To George Arlett, it must look even brighter. Rowing is not a gentlemen’s sport anymore— now everybody has the chance to row that dirty water.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, every sports fanatic has undoubtedly fantasized about his fair share of glorious moments: hitting a walk-off home run in the World Series, running through the finish tape at a marathon, or netting the game-winning shot at the buzzer. Among those victorious images, competing in the Olympic Games almost always stands out as the pinnacle of international athletics.
Flash forward to Rio de Janeiro, summer 2016. Harvard junior Vincent Breet found himself living that dream, powering through the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas alongside three fellow South Africans and vying for a medal in the most prestigious competition in all of sports. The opportunity to live out his dream—representing his country doing something he loves—did not come easy. Vince’s path to the Olympics began in 8th grade, when he picked up the sport of rowing to satisfy his school’s athletic requirement. Despite his family history in water sports, in particular  swimming and water polo, Breet decided his abilities were best suited for an on-the-surface activity.
“I wasn’t very good for the first two or three years,” Breet was quick to admit, “but [I] just put in the work.”
As Breet’s crew career took off, he began rowing for his high school, St. Benedict’s College, and found great success there. In 2010, he wet his feet in international racing, representing his homeland at the World Junior Championships in the Czech Republic. After falling victim to some startling competition and placing 10th, Vince transitioned to a smaller boat class by 2011 and subsequently and was accepted into Harvard later that year.
“I had eight months to kill before my freshman year started, so I decided to try out for the under-23 team… as an 18-year old,” Breet remembered fondly.
Rowing for the U23 team in 2012, the summer before his freshman year, Breet established a familiar pattern: wherever he rowed, he always seemed to precociously over-perform for his age. Breet grew accustomed to overcoming adversity, whether rooted in age or lack of experience in the limelight, and this underdog mentality has seemingly followed him everywhere in the sport of rowing.
“Even in Rio, we were by far the youngest boat on average,” Breet acknowledged. “And I’m always one of the youngest on the start line.”
By the end of 2014, qualifying for Rio became a serious possibility for Breet, and in order to focus purely on rowing, he decided to temporarily pause his Harvard life for three semesters while he pursued his dream of representing his country in the Olympic Games.
“Probably after my sophomore year when we came in third at the World [Championships], Rio became a very realistic goal,” Breet said, “We had beat previous Olympic medalists and had set ourselves up to do well.”
Breet’s Harvard teammates were not particularly shocked at his decision to step away from school and focus on rowing.
“[Breet] is obviously a very top talent. I think everyone assumed the Olympics was on his mind,” said Harvard heavyweight crew captain Chase Buchholz. “It wasn’t a big surprise to people when he decided to take time off to train for it.”
After roughly a dozen Rio hopefuls were narrowed down, Breet remained as a member of South Africa’s fastest foursome and secured his spot on the final boat that would attempt to qualify for the Games. While this feat alone is a massive achievement, it was only the beginning of a long and winding road for Breet as summer approached. Long stretches of intensive training presented the challenges of injury, fatigue, and monotony:
“For [Breet, training] definitely was not an easy process, and he worked through a lot,” Buchholz recognized.
Breet’s boat actually missed qualifications in the traditional Olympic sense, whereby the top 12 finishers in the previous year’s World Championship race gain automatic bids to the Games. With its Olympic future in the balance, the South African rowing team made some modifications to the boat: two rowers from the previous year were replaced by fresh faces, and Breet’s team luckily managed to late-qualify in the spring of 2016—just mere weeks before the athletic festivities were set to begin in Brazil.
“Our run-up to Rio was pretty turbulent,” Breet conceded. “[Our team] subbed in two new guys, so we had an entirely new boat…. We were very much the dark horses on the scene…. I’d argue that the Games were very much our first proper race.”
The late scramble to qualify, not to mention the last-minute roster changes, presented unique and unforeseen challenges, especially psychologically, for Breet’s South African team. Nevertheless, Breet and his fellow South African rowers, all Olympic rookies, embraced the familiar role of the underdog:
“At the games, we improved day-to-day,” said Breet, applauding his team’s resiliency. “The nice thing is that because we were unknown and had no expectations, the expectation at the beginning was for us to come in last, and we readjusted that every day.”
The South Africans’ path to the medal race had “dark horse” written all over it, but to the credit of the team, this was methodically planned: Breet and company availed themselves of the repechage, a unique opportunity during which teams that lose their initial heat can earn a spot in the semi-finals by placing in a “redemption race” of sorts.
“Our intention was to go into the [first] heat really tired,” Breet said, elaborating on his team’s strategy in Rio, “and sort of peak later in the week for our semi-final…. You need to do well through the beginning stages but then really well in the later stages.”
Following a repechage victory coupled with a strong semi-final performance, Breet found himself lining up to race for an Olympic medal—the childhood fantasy was actually playing out in front of his very eyes.
“Our motto is you only need a boat and a little bit of water to row,” Breet said, reminiscing about his team’s flexible attitude.
Breet’s Rio experience was nothing short of memorable: overcoming unanticipated obstacles, genuinely contending for a medal, and donning the green and gold with the utmost honor. And yet, the Games came and went. Before he knew it, Breet, one of three Harvard undergraduates to have competed in Rio, was on his way back to the U.S. to resume his studies, albeit without a medal.
It seems as though Breet, the precocious Olympic dark horse and near-medalist, has returned to Cambridge with an extra layer of world perspective. He noted that his two years away from school have allowed him to appreciate life’s big picture and handle the day-to-day stress more effectively than the pre-Rio Vince.
“I would say I’m having a lot more fun here on [the Harvard] team,” Breet noted. “I have a lot of advice to offer…. I’ve become the sounding board for [Coach Butt].”
The Harvard heavyweight crew team is excited to have Breet back on the team, as they look forward to picking Breet’s brain this season.
“We really benefit from [Breet] translating that hunger for winning and coming so close [to medaling] into coming back to the team,” Buchholz said. “He’s taken a leadership role, bringing all of his experience from training through an Olympic cycle and racing in an Olympic final.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rarely does the Harvard football team have to play a game after a loss. To put that in perspective, the squad has only lost 13 games since 2006. But when they do lose, they don’t lose again. The last time the Crimson lost two games in a row was in 2006.
Harvard is coming off of a loss this week, defeated by Holy Cross 27-17 last weekend in Worcester, Mass. However, the Crimson is still atop the Ivy League standings at 4-1, going 2-0 in league play so far. Sitting with the team, though, are the Princeton Tigers.
This weekend, the Crimson will play Princeton (4-1, 2-0 Ivy League) in its third Ancient Eight game this season. Having already beaten Cornell and Brown, Harvard looks to gain sole possession of the Ivy League standings.
“They’re a good football program,” senior defensive lineman James Duberg said. “We’re just trying to get everyone ready, young guys specifically...really know what you’re doing on every single play, visualize what you’re going to do, and execute that. Going into Princeton, I know we’re feeling confident.”
The defensive line will be key for Harvard this weekend. Princeton has a run-heavy offense, running the ball almost twice as much as they pass. For good reason too—with the exception of last week’s 88 yard performance, the Tigers have yet to rush for less than 150 yards in a game.
The defensive front for Harvard has been solid against the run, though. Even playing with a depleted linebacking corps, opposing teams are averaging 100 yards per game on the ground.
While the line seems to be solid against the run, they also have been strong in the passing game. It has accounted for 14 sacks on the season, including a six-sack game against Holy Cross last week. They played a large part in keeping the Crimson in the game last week, forcing the Crusaders to punt six times and miss two field goals. The line also limited Holy Cross to 3.7 yards per carry.
“They do run a high tempo offense, so they’re going to be running a lot of plays,” Duberg said. “They’re going to be rotating some guys, so it’s going to be a little difficult to try to string together some good pass rush moves...because we might be facing a different guy on multiple plays throughout different series.”
On the other side of the ball, the Tigers have only once given up more than 100 yards on the ground this season. The Crimson, on the other hand, are average 158.8 rushing yards per game. But the Tigers’ opponents average only 2.5 yards per rush. However, the Princeton secondary is not as solid. They’ve given up 1,289 yards through the air with opponents averaging 12.6 yards per catch. Harvard has thrown for 1,339 yards this season, the most in the Ivy League this season.
“They’re a talented group up front,” senior offensive lineman Max Rich said. “They do some really good things. They blitz, twist a lot, they light it up. They’ve played really well their last few games. It’ll be a great challenge. They’ll be a great team.”
But Harvard’s offensive line has been in flux all season, and the lack of consistency was most clear last weekend. Up until last week, the Crimson had given up eight sacks on the season. They gave up six against Holy Cross. While this might be a testament to Holy Cross’ front seven, it also shows just how depleted the line has been.
“We didn’t execute to our ability,” Rich said. “We should’ve been better up front, but that’s on us. We had a rough week, and we’ve got to pick it up this week, otherwise it’ll be another tough challenge.”
In addition, while Harvard is currently atop the Ancient Eight in total offense, averaging 425.2 yards per game, the team only gained 245 yards throughout last week’s game. The absence of top playmakers senior quarterback Joe Viviano, junior running back Semar Smith, and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley was clearly felt, but their presence wouldn’t have changed the six sacks and 26 rushing yards.
the going only gets tougher at Princeton this weekend. Facing a top Ivy contender, reeling from a rare loss,  Harvard will have to plumb deep reserves of motivation to secure the win. It’s a task that requires physical toughness and mental fortitude. The exact qualities, in other words, that have delivered the Crimson to this point.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team officially begins its season this weekend as the squad immediately opens up ECAC play on the road against Dartmouth. Crimson coach Katey Stone and her team will look to flip the script and get off to a winning start following last year’s season opener loss to the Big Green by a 2-1 margin.
After losing its lone exhibition game at home, 3-0, to a McGill squad that tied against the Big Green just a couple of days later, however, the team heads into its first matchup of the season with more questions than answers.
GAME OF GOALIES
While Coach Stone is used to dealing with the loss of great players, having to bid adieu to arguably the best netminder in program history this past spring has to be a huge blow for Harvard.
The graduation of Emerance Maschmeyer ’16, who holds the program record for most career saves and was selected fourth overall in the 2016 CWHL draft, leaves behind a huge question mark in goal, one of the strongest positions for the Crimson since Laura Bellamy ’13 took as a freshman in the 2009-2010 season.
Seniors Molly Tissenbaum and Brianna Laing will likely compete for the starting spot over the first few games after each spent just under 30 minutes on the ice against the Martlets. The duo combined for 30 saves and survived five out of the six power plays given up by Harvard.
Things should get a bit easier for the netminders and the Crimson backline, as Dartmouth lost three of its top four scorers–who accounted for 39 of the team’s 51 goals last season.
POWER PLAY PERILS
Much like last season, the Harvard attack showed a lack of finishing when handed an advantage against McGill, failing to convert any of the five power plays in its favor.
After suffering a streak of 25 unconverted power plays over the span of nine games last season, during which the Crimson went 3-5-1, the team will need to be sharp to take advantage of the extra woman situation. Dartmouth posted an ECAC third-best 89.3 percent kill rate and allowed a mere 11 goals off the power play in the 2015-2016 season.
In addition to losing Maschmeyer and ex co-captain Michelle Picard ’16 the back, Harvard also has to replace last year’s leading points scorer Miye D’Oench ’16, who also led the team with three goals on the power play.
The team will rely heavily on senior forward Sydney Daniels, who scored a team high 23 goals last year, to carry a frontline that also no longer boasts Karly Heffernan. The Sherwood Park, Alberta native–who scored 24 points last season for the Crimson, good for third on the team behind Daniels and D’Oench–suffered a season-ending injury during the preseason.
Without two of last year’s first line attackers, Harvard rolled out a front line of Daniels, junior Lexie Laing, and freshman Val Turgeon against McGill. Junior forward Haley Mullins also figures to feature for Stone and will provide some much needed depth for a young core of attackers.
The Crimson offense will look to score its first goal of the season against Dartmouth keeper Robyn Chemago, who allowed 2.30 goals per game, good for only eighth in the ECAC.
NEBULOUS EXPECTATIONS
Coming off of a national runner-up season in 2014-2015, Harvard had clear expectations to challenge for the ECAC and even a national title last season, an expectation buoyed by the lofty 4/5 ranking given to the team at the start of the season.
This season, things are murkier for the squad. Predicted to finish fifth in the preseason ECAC poll, there is no clear expectation for the team to challenge for the conference title outside of the program.
A fifth place finish during the regular season would leave the Crimson in a tough position if they want to return to the NCAA tournament. Harvard would have to start on the road in a three-game quarterfinal series against the No. 4 seed before likely having to play two more road games to get the conference title.
Unless the Crimson can establish itself as a top six to eight team by the time the ECAC playoffs roll around, the team will likely have to win the title in order to secure an automatic bid instead of a potential at-large bid.
While it may be tempting to look towards the end of the season, however, Harvard will need to get off to a good start on Sunday. With the team largely under the radar this offseason, a good start to the season against the Big Green could go a long way for confidence later on in the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1984, Alvaro Rodriguez Arregui rowed in the Head of the Charles regatta for the first time. At that point, he was an international student from Mexico rowing for the Berkshire School.
Thirty-two years later, Rodriguez Arregui is now the successful managing partner of Mexico-based venture capitalist firm Ignia, which invests exclusively in products that help the emerging middle class. And this Saturday’s men’s senior masters singles race will mark his sixth consecutive Head of the Charles race and the 12th of his career.
“It’s been on and off,” Rodriguez Arregui said. “I’m less prepared than I should be, and the conditions will be horrible, but I’m excited.”
Rodriguez Arregui’s rowing career began at Berkshire, and he continued to row for a club team when he attended college in Mexico, before also rowing for the Mexican national team. When he attended Harvard Business School from 1993 to 1995, he rowed for the HBS team and competed in an eight boat in the Head of the Charles.
He only recently returned to rowing, however, and the Head of the Charles became a concrete goal that he could work towards.
“I missed it, and I needed something to be in shape,” Rodriguez Arregui said. “ I loved the Head of the Charles, so I said look, why don’t I take that as my objective of my year. That’ll get me back into training, and it’s something that I love doing.”
To train, Rodriguez Arregui fits a consistent training schedule into his busy week. While running his socially minded venture capitalist firm, he aims at training six days a week—three days on the water and three days in the gym.
Although his hometown of Mexico City lacks natural rivers for him to train in, he has been able to get his river training in by using the rowing course that was built for the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.
“It’s always hard to make time, but it depends on how you make it a priority,” Rodriguez Arregui said.
As race day approaches, Rodriguez Arregui has spent the past week here in Cambridge, getting out on the water as early as 6 a.m. and rowing in the dark.
“I’m feeling good,” Rodriguez Arregui said. “If you’re a master, you go by age bracket. So this is the last year in my age bracket. I’m one of the old folks.”
“Next year, I’ll be one of the youngsters.”
