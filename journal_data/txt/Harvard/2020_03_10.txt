After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“No men were harmed in the making of this video,” reads a disclaimer at the end of Taylor Swift’s new music video for “The Man.” This comment is particularly ironic considering that the video centers around Taylor Swift’s male alter ego, Tyler Swift, played by Swift herself — with the help of impressive makeup and hair styling. The forthright lyrics of Swift’s feminist pop song, the fourth single from her most recent album “Lover” in which she imagines how people would perceive her if she were a man, speak for themselves. “If I was a man, then I’d be the man,” she sings in the chorus. The witty and intelligent video emphasizes Swift’s power to help foster a culture of equality as she rejects the sexist double standards that have been imposed upon her for her entire career.
Tyler Swift is just like Taylor Swift in that he is attractive and successful, but he faces none of the endless critiques that Taylor does as a woman with those qualities. “I would be complex, I would be cool / They’d say I played the field before I found someone to commit to,” Taylor sings as her male counterpart is shown in a power pose before walking out of his office to effusive congratulations from his subordinates. On the way home, he manspreads on the subway, unconscious of his spatial occupancy as he lets his cigar ash fall onto the woman next to him.
“The Man”’s music video then continues to portray Tyler as an egoist on an endless power trip, one who is never called out for his selfish or rude actions. He’s shown yelling on a phone call while pacing the deck of a yacht, surrounded by beautiful young women suntanning in identical yellow bikinis. As these women thoughtlessly praise him during the pre-chorus, Taylor makes a more specific jab at the unfairness of double standards: “And we would toast to me, oh, let the players play / I'd be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez.” While the song attacks all sorts of double standards, from working to parenting, a recurring theme seems to focus on the fact that Taylor has often been criticized for being a “serial dater.” Although she seems to have settled down with current boyfriend Joe Alwyn, Taylor’s long list of exes has famously brought her severe scrutiny. With this line, she envies the ease of Leonardo DiCaprio’s dating life. Famous for an extensive list of supermodel girlfriends under the age of 25, the most heat Leo gets for his love life is a casual dig at the Golden Globes from Ricky Gervais. “The Man” brings this double standard to life as Tyler is applauded as a womanizer, while Taylor was demonized for dating around.
Taylor’s criticism doesn't stop with her commentary on the gendered inequities of dating in the public eye. In one of the best scenes of the music video, Tyler accompanies his adorable toddler to a park, distractedly patting her head as he takes a phone call. Onlooking women swoon at his small and infrequent displays of fatherly affection, underscoring the fact that men face significantly lower societal expectations as parents. Tyler is allowed to be a distracted father because he’s “hardworking,” and the second he pays attention to his child, he’s perceived as the World’s Greatest Dad. By invoking the unjust culture of parenting, Swift adds more layers to her feminist pop song. All of this is set to a catchy, synth-laden, upbeat track, making “The Man” a bubbly, singalong pop song with pointed contrast between its melody and meaningful lyrics.
Toward the end of the video, Tyler throws an aggressive tantrum over a tennis match before we flash-forward 58 years to his marriage to a much younger woman. He forcefully stuffs cake in her face, embodying the unhealthy power dynamic between the two. After the song itself ends, the shot widens to show Taylor in a director’s chair. Tyler, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, asks if his acting was okay. “Could you try to be sexier, maybe a little more likable?” she requests, before turning to an actress who did nothing more than stand on the side of the tennis court. She rolls her eyes, and says “Excellent work over there, Lauren, that was astonishing.” With this final inversion of gender roles, Taylor perfectly captures the essence of her song: She calls attention to the normalization of overt sexism in the entertainment industry, unsubtly targeting every director who’s ever asked her to be “sexier” and cleverly urging viewers to challenge the status quo.

Look around Boston, the United States, or much of the world and there’s a good chance you’ll see one of Ieoh Ming (I.M.) Pei’s postcard-worthy architectural creations. Bold and brilliant, embedded into a mountain or rising to define a skyline, Pei’s versatile modernist structures at once inspire both awe and controversy.
Pei, who passed away at 102 last year, had a cosmopolitan and international upbringing that informed his career as an artist. Born in Guangzhou, he lived in Hong Kong and Shanghai before coming to MIT and Harvard to study architecture. He later volunteered for the WWII war effort and joined the National Defense Research Committee, where he became a bomb expert. In 1955, Pei started his own firm, I.M. Pei & Associates. In 1967, he completed one of his earliest masterworks, the National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. The building, with its red-brown color matching the mountains behind it, seems to rise spontaneously out of the cliffs themselves. The sharp lines and geometric towers create a vision that’s both unmistakably Pei’s own and perfectly complementary to its surroundings –– a harbinger of what was to come from the young architect.
In the late 1970s, Pei completed two major museum projects: monuments to a cherished American institution and to a beloved American figure. First came the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington (opened in 1978), where large geometric towers and light-catching angular shapes flow seamlessly into one another. Like the Mesa Laboratory, Pei’s creation catches the eye while still sitting in consonance with the more traditional West Building and the surrounding National Mall.
The following year saw the completion of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Overlooking the Boston skyline and the surrounding bay, Pei’s structure rises with a bold, bright face –– a sharp tower surrounded by smooth, cylindrical shapes. Within an enormous and sunlit pavilion, a massive American flag looks to the horizon beyond. Pei himself described this homage to Kennedy best: “In the skyline of his city, in the distant horizons toward which he led us, in the canopy of space into which he launched us, visitors may experience revived hope and promise for the future.”
It wasn’t until the 1980s, however, that Pei unveiled his most famous and controversial creation: the Louvre pyramid. This glass structure rises from the literal center of one of France’s most treasured cultural landmarks, a grand palace for the world’s most famous art collection. Just like the Mesa Laboratory or the NGA’s East Building, the pyramid is a striking yet harmonious presence. As transparent as the glass with which it was made, the pyramid is not a destructive addition. Rather, its simple, singular design fits neatly with the elegant symmetry of the palace that surrounds it.
While the Louvre pyramid represented his most visible creation, Pei –– by then a Pritzker Prize winner and soon-to-be Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient –– remained hard at work on a number of pieces that underscored his versatility. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (1995) is a band of shapes and structures, coming together both smoothly and sharply on the edge of Lake Erie. Pei also returned to his Chinese roots, designing the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing (1983), the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong (1989), and the Suzhou Museum (2006). The Bank of China Tower projects a distinctively modern image onto the Hong Kong skyline, with multiple sharp edges blending into one blade at the top. In contrast, the Fragrant Hill Hotel and the Suzhou Museum are both quite understated in their style — Pei’s modern, geometric trademark exists within a more traditional Chinese design.
At over 90 years old, Pei designed one of his last museums, the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar (2008). Its stately and simple design evokes an Islamic fortress on an island. From afar, simple geometric blocks bend together, their faces basking in brilliant light or dark shade. Here, one of Pei’s final creations resembles the many that came before it. Understated yet unassumingly grand, the building is a bold but welcome complement to its surroundings. It is representative of the mode of thinking, creating, and living that defined Pei and his many contributions to our built environment.

Continuing the first story arc of Season Seven, “On the Wings of Keeradacks” feels almost indistinguishable from many “Clone Wars” episodes. Following a harrowing escape from the city of Purkoll and the droids of the Techno Union, the protagonists — with the addition of the rescued Echo (Dee Bradley Baker) — scurry to a small town of the indiginous Poletec people as their last ditch effort to escape. The episode concludes with a battle between savvy Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter), Captain Rex, and the Bad Batch and the Union’s D-Wing Support Droids and two Octuptarra Tri-Droids to protect the Poletec people.
This type of story arc is far from unusual for “The Clone Wars.” Across Seasons One, Three, and Four, the clones and Jedi often find themselves in situations where they inadvertently bring peace-loving civilians into the crosshairs of galactic war. In Season One, episodes 13 and 14, the Lurmen people are forced into a battle with droids following a crash landing. Later, in Season One, episode 15 Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi (James Arnold Taylor) investigate the happenings on the icy moon of Orto Plutonia, discovering the Talz people. Similarly, Season Three, episodes 21 and 22 sees Ashoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) kidnapped by Trandoshans where she must empower a group of fellow kidnapees to rebel against their captors. Season Four episodes one, two and three continue this trend by depicting the people of Mon Cala — the same people who later help found the rebellion and win the war against the Galactic Empire — as they are attacked by Aqua Droids, requiring the protection and bolstering of the Republic. Clearly, the 12-year run of the show is not without certain patterns.
As trite as this pattern may seem, this repetition in Season Seven serves two purposes. First, by layering new characters and stakes onto familiar sequences, “On the Wings of Keeradacks” fits into the Clone Wars continuity without much surprise or frustration. Second, it portrays the realities of war, in which the innocent civilians are thrown into conflict against their wishes. While capitalizing on the adventures of a galaxy-spanning war, “The Clone Wars” continually preaches the toll the war takes on its active participants — as seen in Echo’s fall from ambitious, successful ARC Trooper to Wat Tambor’s science experiment — as well as those who stand idly by — the Poletec, Talz, and Lurmen.
“On the Wings of the Keeradacks” feels just like any random episode from the more than one hundred in the series library. There are exciting fight scenes and carefully crafted dialogue — with the exception of some of the writing for Wrecker, one of the members of the Bad Batch. With only the introduction of new droids and Echo’s technological manipulation, this episode is nothing special in the scheme of “The Clone Wars.” I hope the conclusion to “The Bad Batch” story arc brings the thrill, excitement, and intrigue that has made this show so memorable.

Moses Sumney split his second studio album, “græ,” into two parts, releasing the first on Feb. 21 with plans to release the second in May. Sumney’s records are a singular blend of electric, folk, and soul music, consciously synthesized into something entirely unique. The 12 tracks on “græ: Part 1” extend his eclectic combination of genres further than ever before. Altogether, “græ: Part 1” gives listeners a glimpse into Sumney’s musical aura, including his personal musings and artistic expression. Listening to “græ: Part 1” is an entirely visceral experience, imprinting one’s mind with an exploration of identity.
The cover art for “græ: Part 1” depicts a nude Black figure lifting themself out of a plunge pool and onto a boulder as a waterfall cascades in the background. This image can be thought of as a symbol of Sumney’s artistic baptism or rejuvenation. “Cut Me” provides the clearest musical representation of this awakening. Sumney’s imitation of Aretha Franklin in the first lines of this track, invoking the Lydian mode in vocal runs, conjures up the sort of freedom one would imagine he enjoys as he sings in the shower. The song gives listeners the privilege to not only indulge in his liberation, but to also vibe to the familiar bass line and muted brass that doubles his vocals in the chorus.
No review of Sumney’s discography would be complete without reference to his magical, difficult-to-pin-down voice. His famous hypnotic falsetto makes several appearances throughout the album; however, it is especially compelling in “In Bloom” and “Neither/Nor.” In the midst of a delicately plucked electric guitar riff and surges of sweet string figures, Sumney sings about unrequited love in “In Bloom” (“Sometimes I want to kiss my friends”). Philosophical thoughts of identity are confronted in “Neither/Nor,” haunting listeners with the repeated question of “who is he?” among the pulsing dance of a tender acoustic guitar. Sumney has a gift for injecting passion and spirit into relaxed tracks like these.
At the same time, Sumney makes faster, harder-driving tracks seem similarly effortless. “Virile” begins with angelic harp cascades complemented by flute trills, which seamlessly transition into electric guitar and drums, achieving a classic rock-like essence with a touch of soul. The music is a suitable match for the subject of the lyrics: confronting toxic masculinity. Sumney proclaims that “The virility fades / You've got the wrong guy,” communicating his fluid understanding of gender.
Another healthy dose of social commentary arises in “boxes,” in which Sumney interrogates the labels people tend to place on themselves and others as a means of security. The repeated samples of gasps that establish the rhythmic quality of the track add an additional layer of personality. This track has no melody, giving it more of a cadenced spoken word feel. An ambiguous voice conveys the significance of personal definitions, saying “I truly believe that people who define you control you / And the most significant thing that any person can do / But especially black women and men / Is to think about who gave them their definitions / And rewrite those definitions for themselves.” “boxes” is essentially a call to action that serves as mesmeric departure from the other tracks in “græ: Part 1.”
Throughout his music, Sumney’s palpable talent emanates from both his songs’ creative sonic construction to the pure poetry embedded within his lyrics. In “græ: Part 1,” he is able to more deeply explore his identity with reference to his relationships, masculinity, and race than ever before. This album is undoubtedly a project that Sumney spent a lot of time and energy perfecting, and the final product is more than masterful. It is a nuanced, captivating, and complex addition to Sumney’s discography.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, the candidates running for the Democratic nomination were the most diverse ever to run for a major party’s nomination. This diversity reflected the party itself — a party that’s increasingly uplifting the voices of minorities, working-class Americans, and those suffering through historic inequality. That diversity made me proud.
I was proud because I thought I’d be casting my first vote in a primary election for a candidate that looked like me and that supported many of the ideas I care about. But my candidate would drop out in early January, and over a few weeks, the field would whittle down from the most diverse ever to one whose front-runners have all the diversity of a 77-year-old white man and a 78-year-old white man.
I don’t mean to minimize the ideological differences between these candidates — though they’ve often voted together in the Senate, more than a handful of differences set them apart. These differences give their supporters ammunition to use against the other candidate, but this infighting will only hurt the party as it struggles to find its leader.
The soul-searching of finding another candidate to support over and over has taken a toll on my enthusiasm and has left me only mildly energized, to say the least. From my conversations with others, I think that’s how many of us young Democrats feel — especially those from minority backgrounds.
But on Super Tuesday, while the latest of my chosen candidates underperformed, another overwhelmingly won over crucial minority voters. For all the talk of increasing turnout among young voters and minorities, my then-candidate demonstrated an inability to do so. We cannot extend this primary and risk a repeat of 2016. I want to make the case for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is a dedicated, passionate public servant, a proven leader, and more than qualified to be the next President of the United States. He’s been endorsed by more local, state, and national leaders than any other candidate, and has demonstrated an ability to build a winning coalition. He is not the perfect candidate. He has made mistakes and is more centrist than many young voters would like, but now is the time for unity because the alternative is too dangerous. I believe these are the calculations that other candidates made before dropping out of the race, and they might also be why a plurality of them now support Biden.
We’ve already seen what can happen when a primary battle goes on for too long. In 2016, the election was decided by a total of 77,700 voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In all of these states, turnout for Democrats decreased from the last election by more than or approximately this amount. No one can know whether this was because Democratic voters didn’t like their candidate or because the lengthy primary race had disillusioned them, but we should not risk the same outcome again. We cannot repeat the mistake of fracturing the party and frustrating its voters.
Over the last four years, we’ve gotten a taste of what’s at stake when Democrats are unable to successfully rally around a candidate. Economic gains and tax cuts have disproportionately benefited the wealthy. On civil rights, we’ve watched this administration fail to stand up for those at risk. At the border, we’ve watched this administration commit human rights violations against children. We have no plan for the climate, no end in sight to a costly trade war. Now a dangerous disease’s global spread has been fueled by this administration’s empty statements and lack of action.
It’s on all Democrats to rally behind the frontrunner and to make sure we extoll his virtues — and there are many. He wrote one of the first climate change bills, has been a leader in the Senate, has taken on the National Rifle Association, spoke up about gay rights before many others, and has remained in the public eye for most of his life. He’s been vetted, he’s experienced, and I trust him to lead this country.
When my home state of Florida votes on March 17, I will cast my ballot for Joe Biden. He wasn’t my first choice, but he is a good man and a good candidate. Come November, he will provide a clear contrast to our current leader for voters around the country.
What’s at stake here are the lives of migrants, health insurance for millions of Americans, the economic stability of farmers, workers, and businessmen alike, the future of our climate, and the sanctity of our democratic institutions. This election is too important to lose in the primaries, again.
To echo the slogan of the 2016 Democratic nominee, we are stronger together. As Democrats, we must recognize this truth and cast aside internal differences. Instead, we must work together to put this country back on track. While the words of a New York Times opinion columnist say that to choose Joe Biden is “to choose the past over the future,” really it’s to choose a past we can build upon and one that I believe a majority of Americans would prefer to the present. In Joe Biden, I might be voting for a lesser evil, but I’m also voting for the chance at a greater good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After your stint at Teach for America, a two-year post-undergraduate teaching program, you decided to leave the academic world behind and work in New York City. Where are you most likely to be employed? Goldman Sachs.
But we will get back to that.
We need to change the pernicious idea that public service is on a separate moral level of “goodness” because it is undertaken purely for selfless reasons. This piece of philosophical fiction is at odds with reality, so much so that it only entrenches the reality it seeks to deny. It is only by acknowledging and appealing to the selfish instincts of people that we can fulfill the goal that should be at the heart of service — serving others.
The selfless ethic of service has many intellectual sources, but I suspect that it finds its purest expression in Kantian moral philosophy. Kant viewed moral action as a dispassionate adherence to moral law. Through enlightened reason we freely choose to do the right thing only because it's objectively the right thing to do, not because of any personal benefits. In fact, Kant says if we act for any selfish reasons we can no longer claim to have acted “morally” since the good result of our actions are only the by-product of our self-interest.
These days few people are as Kantian as Kant, but his insights are embedded in our perception of public service. Public service is noble because it involves a sacrifice of self-interest. Public servants transcend self-interest because they cast it aside.
Yet this praise of the selfless public career path presumes and only confirms the domination of the private, for-profit career. Only 17 percent of the 2019 class had finalized careers in nonprofits, non-governmental organizations, or governments at the time of graduation. This statistic is actually quite impressive. Only about a quarter of Harvard students volunteer with the Phillips Brooks House Association in a given year, and about the same percentage of my class volunteered for the Day of Service. The problem with public service is that this neo-Kantian ethic of service only has two ways of persuasion: praise and shame, both of which are clearly incapable of motivating a majority of talented students.
I contend that self-interest is what consistently causes college students to wake up at early hours and be on their peak mental game for an entire day. An affinity and passion for the demanding workload is necessary for success in both the private and public spheres, but that passion doesn’t last forever. Sometimes people wake up in the mornings because of the work they do, but other times they wake up in spite of the work they must do, and just try and get through the day. It is during these moments of apathy that the private sector has its greatest allure. Economic self-interest works better to motivate than any praise and shame associated with moral duty. Even if the ideal of selfless service attracts some to the public sphere, it has no way of guaranteeing continued dedication, except through praise and shame.
Which brings us back to Teach for America. Teach for America critics, both within and outside the organization, view the program’s own preparation as inadequate to produce quality teachers. Teachers report feeling ashamed for being unable to teach at the level which they aspired to, and burnout is a real concern for corps members. Some members do develop lifetime passions for teaching and continue on in different advisory contexts, but others, disillusioned by their time as teachers, leave the academic world behind for more lucrative pastures. As such, critics come to view the program on the whole as glorified “resume padding”, in which teachers don’t even fulfill those responsibilities that they put on their resume in the first place.
Where the neo-Kantians see dereliction of duty or the moral degradation of service, I see opportunity. Partnerships with Goldman Sachs are not what is wrong with Teach for America, but its greatest potential asset.
The necessary accompaniment of the pursuit of self-interest is competition — we can’t all get what we want. Teach for America’s problem is not the intrusion of self-interest, but its unwillingness to harness this self-interest and the productive fruits of competition for the students that it serves. Teach for America should expand its partnerships with Goldman and other prestigious companies in the private sector, so much so that it almost becomes a backdoor to them. However, it should make offers contingent upon so many objective teaching metrics — test scores, student reviews and peer reviews — that the only way for corps members to get these jobs is to be good teachers.
The best part about this suggestion is that the competition will spur other teachers to new heights. Shame from failure to live up to an impossible ideal is one thing, but shame from potentially performing worse at one’s own vocation than future investment bankers is another.
The competition induced by self-interest doesn’t cheapen service, it revitalizes it. Service should be for the people whom we serve, not for ourselves, because we can’t always live up to the best of our intentions, and it doesn’t make sense to hold ourselves to an unattainable ideal. Instead, if service is about impacting others, we should be willing, and even obligated, to use every incentive we have to improve the quality of service that is provided.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pandemics are scary and fear can bring out the worst in us, as the spread of xenophobia and racism around the world in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak demonstrates. In the face of this public health challenge, we hope that everyone in our community will stay mentally and physically well. Still, we urge our campus community to be prepared, be courageous, and be there for one another in these challenging times. Only when we are united can we persevere in the face of this global threat.
As coronavirus continues to spread globally, schools and universities have begun to shut down, affecting almost 300 million students worldwide as of Wednesday In the United States, at least ten states have now declared states of emergencies and, as of Monday, coronavirus cases in Massachusetts number over 40, with at least 32 cases linked to a conference held by Biogen, a biotech company headquartered in Cambridge. Harvard has revealed new policies in response to this growing pandemic including prohibiting official international travel and non-essential domestic travel, postponing gatherings of more than 100 people such as Housing Day, and canceling Visitas — the College’s admitted students weekend.
While we are aware that Harvard has likely considered different measures of responding to the threat of coronavirus on campus, we urge the University to prioritize the most vulnerable members of our community while it continues to develop its policies. The spread of coronavirus will be especially harmful for international students, those from heavily-affected regions, those from low-income households, and those with pre-existing conditions. We urge Harvard to seriously consider the implications of their policies on these students and maintain sufficient and timely communications with them about what special accommodations, if any, they will provide or consider providing.
We hope that staff who play a critical and often under-recognized role in our community — not least maintenance and facilities, dining hall, and security staff — will be considered in all decision-making, such that they will not be put in unsafe conditions and will not be compelled to work while sick for lack of sick-leave compensation.
Students should also not feel compelled to attend classes and activities if they wish to self-isolate, and the University should specify the academic implications of doing so.
The University must ensure transparency to allow students to plan ahead. That shouldn’t merely be a matter of keeping the University apprised of current working policy, but the potential policies that may ultimately be invoked, the criteria the University is using to make those decisions, and the likely implications for all University affiliates. Transparency, in that sense, should be proactive.
Still, we acknowledge that these are difficult decisions for University leadership with few clear or certain answers. They’re no doubt working hard to make the best possible choices they can with respect to both prioritizing the well-being of Harvard affiliates and promoting public health broadly, in light of fluid, perilous circumstances. Whatever course of action the University decides to take should be grounded in the specific circumstances we at Harvard find ourselves in. Again, proactive, not reactive, might be the operative mantra. While it should learn from the choices of other universities — like Princeton University, Columbia University, and Stanford University canceling classes — the University should not simply mimic their actions.
As we opined last week, we expect the University to fight against the perpetuation of xenophobia as anti-Asian racism has spread with coronavirus. But in light of federal mismanagement of the crisis and dissemination of “alternative facts” on the threat coronavirus poses, we believe the University can go a step further. In addition to its own internal and collaborative research efforts, given the wealth of public health and immunological expertise at the University, it makes for Harvard to be a leader in providing accurate, accessible information on coronavirus to the public.
No doubt, these obligations are not small, but with courage, clarity, and compassion, Harvard can prove itself a leader in this time of global crisis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dean of Students Office will pilot a new leadership-oriented program for incoming freshmen this summer.
Leadership Institute for the First-Year Experience (LIFE) will join the existing roster of pre-orientation programs, including Fall-Clean Up, First-Year Arts Program, First-Year International Program, First-Year Outdoor Program, First-Year Retreat and Experience, and First-Year Urban Program.
Kate T. Colleran, assistant dean of student engagement and leadership and director of LIFE, wrote in an emailed statement that the program will recruit 40 students who seek to develop their leadership skills and become “change makers at Harvard and in their own communities.”
The DSO announced the addition of LIFE via admissions marketing materials sent out to the Class of 2024.
Colleran wrote that the DSO began plans for the pilot after surveying the Class of 2023 and noting that students indicated strong interest in leadership-focused programming.
“We received feedback this fall from them about a desire for a Pre-Orientation focused on Leadership,” Colleran wrote. “My team runs the pre-O programs, it seemed like a good fit for us to take the lead on.”
Colleran wrote that program participants will spend the week working with local, “real life” change makers, who will instruct them in the “Social Change model” of leadership.
The LIFE pilot begins shortly after the institutionalization of FYRE, a program to which the College granted permanent funding this fall. FYRE, a pre-orientation program aiming to help under-resourced incoming students adapt to life at the University, received glowing reviews from students when it was first piloted for the Class of 2022.
“We have a variety of amazing programs that all incorporate leadership skills in their own way, but LIFE will focus on naming those skills,” Colleran wrote.
The DSO will administer pre- and post-assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot program. Beyond the five-day pilot, Colleran wrote that she hopes LIFE will encourage a new focus on leadership-oriented opportunities for undergraduates.
“Long-term, the hope is that this kicks off for first-years a desire to be more reflective on their leadership practices,” Colleran wrote. “It could fit into the larger sphere of leadership programming a student can participate in during their time at Harvard. For now, we're going to see how the first year goes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four burglaries were reported on Feb. 29 in Quincy, Lowell, Adams, and Mather Houses respectively, according to police logs released by the Harvard University Police Department.
This latest round of property thefts – which included laptops, camera, cash, and a passport – occurred roughly a month after an earlier string of burglaries on Feb. 4, which affected River Houses and Yard dorms. Burglaries occurred in Quincy House on both occasions.
Shortly after midnight, HUPD officers were dispatched to Quincy House and Lowell House to respond to reports of break-ins, per the police log.
In Quincy House’s Stone Hall, an Apple Macbook valued at $1,500, a Canon Camera valued at $60, $350 in cash, and a passport were reported stolen. Next door, in Lowell House, another Macbook was stolen along with a Samsung laptop valued at $1,000 and a Jansport backpack.
Both thefts occurred between roughly midnight and 1:00 a.m.
Up the street in Adams House’s Hampden building, HUPD officers responded to a report of unlawful entry and theft. The stolen items include two Macbooks valued at $1,500 and $1,200, Airpods, a backpack and a wallet, according to the police log.
An incident was also reported in Mather House, where $60 in unattended cash went missing.
According to HUPD police logs, all four thefts are still under investigation.
In an email to University affiliates last Wednesday, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano and HUPD reminded residents that burglaries into occupied rooms are “rare,” but students should still take proper precautions to prevent theft.
Catalano and HUPD advised students to lock their doors at all times and be aware of other building entrants.
“Residents should not prop interior or exterior doors at any time, hold an outside door open for strangers, or allow strangers to ‘piggyback’ on their access card,” Catalano wrote.
Catalano also encouraged students to call the department immediately if they observe someone acting suspiciously or attempting to enter a dorm.
“Suspicious behavior may include a stranger knocking on your door and asking an out-of-place question, such as ‘did you lose these keys,’ or making an excuse for being found in your room,” he wrote.
Catalano did not respond to a request for comment.
In a bid to reduce thefts, the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee expressed support for external security cameras outside dorms in 2016. Roughly 90 laptops are stolen annually at the University, according to the HUPD website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 11, 1:39 a.m.
The Veterans Legal Clinic at Harvard Law School released a report Thursday contending the Department of Veteran Affairs has unlawfully turned away nearly half a million veterans seeking health care.
The report — titled “Turned Away: How VA Unlawfully Denies Health Care to Veterans with Bad Paper Discharges” — found that more than 400,000 veterans risk being rejected or dissuaded from applying to receive health care due to a lack of guidance, oversight, and adequate training within the VA.
“Many frontline staff at VA health care facilities have improperly turned away former servicemembers seeking health care, telling them that they are ineligible due to their military discharge statuses—without even allowing them to apply,” the report reads.
Those veterans, who have received less-than-honorable discharges, known as “bad paper discharges,” should in theory receive an individualized review by the VA to determine their eligibility for benefits.
“It puts them in a ‘limbo’ category that requires VA to conduct an individualized eligibility determination to decide whether the veteran was discharged under ‘dishonorable conditions’ or ‘other than dishonorable conditions,’” the report reads.
In practice, though, VA staff frequently tell veterans with bad papers they are categorically ineligible to receive health care benefits, according to the report, which blames this discrepancy on incorrect information provided to staff in VA enrollment manuals, handbooks, and trainings.
“By law, every person—regardless of military discharge status—has the right to apply for VA health care, to have VA consider that application on the merits, and to receive a written decision,” Veterans Legal Clinic Instructor Dana Montalto wrote in the press release.
“We heard from veterans and veterans advocates from across the country that instead, when a veteran with bad paper attempts to apply for health care, the front-desk staffer denies the veteran on the spot, without due process, merely by looking at the veteran’s DD 214 discharge papers,” she added.
In response to the criticisms, VA press secretary Christina M. Mandreucci wrote that the agency has "done more outreach to other-than-honorable former service members in the last few years than ever before."
"VA is standardizing enrollment across the department by updating the enrollment system to include identification and tracking of other-than-honorable former service members eligible for care," she wrote.
OUTVETS — an advocacy organization that supports LGBTQ veterans and their families — commissioned the report, which noted that many of the “bad paper” discharges resulted from discrimination by the military. Those past decisions, the report argues, should not prevent veterans from seeking support.
“In many cases, veterans received ‘bad paper’ discharges because they were gay or lesbian, or because they have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or another mental health condition caused by their military service that led to actions resulting in their separation from the military,” the press release reads.
The report recommends the VA take three immediate steps to address the issue, including improvements in training, guidance, oversight of employees, and increased communication between the agency and veterans. It also calls for outreach to veterans who the agency wrongfully turned away in the past.
Montalto said in an interview that she anticipates an increase in oversight of VA practices from Congress following the release of the report, noting that some have already begun to take action in the days since its release.
“After we issued the report, a number of senators like Senator [Richard] Blumenthal of Connecticut submitted a letter to VA, asking for a response to the report,” she said.
The report acknowledges that veterans who received less-than-honorable discharges from the military may have transgressed, but states that all veterans deserve the opportunity to apply for benefits.
“While there should be consequences for military misconduct, those consequences should not include being denied health care—especially if you have a service-related disability, are experiencing homelessness, or are dealing with the impact of MST, as so many veterans with bad paper are,” the report reads. “It is time for VA to stop this cycle of misinformation and stigma and to honor that every person who has served in the military has a right to apply for VA care.”

Harvard University officials have approved a new shield for Kirkland House after a redesign process ran into trademark concerns.
House Administrator Katherine J. Drizos Cavell presented the new shield in an Friday email to House affiliates on behalf of Kirkland Faculty Deans Verena A. Conley and Tom C. Conley.
“Verena and Tom Conley are happy to announce that Kirkland has a new shield!” she wrote. “Verena and Tom thank those who shared their thoughts, stories, time, experiences, and preferences in this process.”
The announcement caps a redesign process that came in response to student concerns that the house's former emblem bore a resemblance to the Confederate flag.
Cavell also noted that students can “immediately” begin using the new shield — which bears a design featuring three white stars arranged horizontally on a black strip with a crimson background — and that Kirkland’s Housing Day festivities would incorporate the new design.
However, University news has put a wrinkle in that plan. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke announced in an email Monday that Housing Day — an annual tradition in which the College assigns each freshman to one of the 12 houses for upperclassmen — will be postponed indefinitely due to concerns over the ongoing spread of coronavirus.
Verena Conley said in a Monday interview that the University approved the second design faster than she anticipated. She also said she thinks the change is a “great” moment for the students who worked on the redesign.
“I think it's wonderful because the students have been waiting for a long time,” she said.
The official approval for the new design comes several days after the Harvard Trademark Program rejected the initial redesign proposal for the shield over concerns that that design would infringe on an existing trademark. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana previously gave preliminary approval for its initial redesign.
The Trademark Program identified an existing trademark for the first redesign, which featured three stars in an inverted triangle on a black shield with a crimson border, according to the Conleys.
Kirkland House Committee Co-Chair Andrea J. Zhang ’22 said she believes Kirkland residents felt relieved after the University approved the new design.
“There is a sense of relief since it’s really going through and really working this time around,” Zhang said. “It’s been a really long journey, and we’re thankful to everyone at the House who contributed to this amazing process.”
Maranda Ngue ’22, co-chair with Zhang, said that, despite seeing the initial rejection as a “bump in the road,” she found Kirkland residents' support made the second attempt easier.
“Even when we hit the bump, I already knew that Kirkland was going to fight until we got our shield, and it's been a very supportive process from everyone in Kirkland,” she said. “Whatever the outcome was, we knew Kirkland would be very proud of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Management Company indirectly holds an estimated $98,265.08 worth of shares through exchange-traded funds which include tobacco companies, an industry Harvard divested from in 1990, according to The Crimson’s analysis of HMC’s public filings to the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
ETFs are exchange-traded securities made up of assorted securities that usually mirror the performance of certain indices. They allow investors to put money into a broad array of companies without having to hold stock in each of the component companies.
Harvard indirectly held equities of several tobacco companies including Altria Group, Philip Morris International, Universal Corporation, and British American Tobacco by the end of 2019 through three widely-traded ETFs that cover a wide range of stocks. According to HMC’s filings, these ETFs include iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, and Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF.
In May 1990, Harvard divested from the tobacco industry and adopted a policy that prohibits the University from owning shares of tobacco companies in the future. At a forum last April about divestment, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said the decision to divest from tobacco included barring the product from campus and prohibiting research funded by tobacco companies.
Asked about the holdings, HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan referred to HMC’s sustainable investment policies.
If the University instructs HMC to divest, HMC would restrict direct holdings of related stocks by internal portfolio managers and outside investment advisors trading in Harvard’s name, according to its sustainable investment policy. The restriction, however, is not extended to “investment advisers of commingled funds where Harvard is not the sole investor” — which is the case for the three ETFs with tobacco investments.
Over the past year, Bacow has consistently opposed divestment from the fossil fuel and prison industry amid protests from students and faculty. Bacow argued at the April forum that the University could never divest fully from fossil fuels, as it did with the tobacco industry.
“The day after, if we were to divest, we’re still going to turn on the lights,” Bacow said in April. “We would still be dependent on fossil fuels.”
Each of the ETFs allocates a certain percentage of their investments to tobacco companies.
iShares Core S&P 500 ETF allocates 0.32 percent and 0.55 percent of its fund to Altria Group and Philip Morris International, and iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF allocates 0.19 percent of its fund to Universal Corporation as of last Friday, according to iShare’s website. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF allocates 0.50 percent of its fund to British American Tobacco as of January, per Vanguard’s website.
The values of the University’s holdings in the three ETFs total around $41 million at the time of the University’s filing. In total, Harvard roughly puts an estimated $98,265.08 into tobacco companies through the three ETFs.
Harvard’s investments in ETFs comprise roughly 6.5 percent of its total U.S. securities holdings. Only about 2 percent of Harvard’s $40.9 billion endowment is publicly available through quarterly disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Harvard only divests in “very rare” occasions when companies engage in “deeply repugnant and ethically unjustifiable” conducts, according to the University’s sustainable investment policy. In addition to tobacco, Harvard divested from companies involved in South African apartheid in 1986 and a company tied to Sudanese government after the Darfur genocide in 2005.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty percent of respondents to a Crimson survey of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences indicated that they know someone in their department who has experienced sexual harassment.
At the same time, just 32 percent of survey-takers felt the University’s Title IX office and Office for Dispute Resolution are “adequately equipped” to deal with sex- and gender-based discrimination at the University. Harvard maintains a University Title IX Office to provide education and resources on Harvard’s gender and sex-based misconduct policies, and the Office for Dispute Resolution to adjudicate formal complaints.
A significantly higher percentage of female survey respondents than male respondents indicated that their work at Harvard has been limited by their gender. While 47 percent of women reported encountering obstacles because of their gender, only seven percent of men said the same.
Harvard saw a jump in sexual harassment complaints after the #MeToo movement began in late 2017 — including some against its faculty members. The University has launched a number of institutional efforts to combat sexual misconduct on campus in recent years, but The Crimson’s survey results indicate that faculty’s experience with such issues remains mixed.
The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,000 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard’s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, pressing issues on campus, and challenges they face as academics. Emeritus, tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.
The 74-question survey garnered more than 400 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 20 to 27. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first and second installments of The Crimson’s 2020 faculty survey series explored faculty perspectives on national politics and the University administration, respectively. This third installment examines the views of the faculty on Harvard’s climate and culture, and on Title IX issues within the FAS.
The majority of faculty who responded to the survey — 58 percent — felt their department creates an environment where students, faculty, and staff feel “comfortable coming forward” about sexual harassment. Fifty-four percent of women and 61 percent of men agreed with the statement.
Still, 43 percent of respondents indicated that they believed their department needs to conduct a survey of departmental climate.
In the wake of nearly 20 women accusing former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment in 2018, the Government department launched a departmental climate review. That committee ultimately concluded that “prolonged institutional failure” facilitated Dominguez’s abuse.
Twenty-four percent of respondents indicated that their work has been limited by gender. Only 11 percent said that they faced barriers at Harvard because of their “racial or ethnic background.”
Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported that they felt their department was “doing enough to promote faculty diversity.” Only 42 percent of respondents, however, said the same about the FAS administration.
While 55 percent of men felt that the FAS administration appropriately promoted diversity, only 21 percent of women felt the same. Answers to the question on departmental diversity also diverged on gender lines, with 67 percent of men in agreement, but 44 percent of women responded affirmatively.
Answers to the questions on diversity also varied between FAS members of different ranks. A slight majority of tenured faculty — 52 percent — felt the FAS administration’s efforts to support diversity were sufficient — but less than 26 percent of lecturers, associate professors and preceptors agreed.
Sixty-nine percent of tenured respondents felt that their department was doing enough, but only 32 percent of preceptors agreed.
In response to The Crimson’s survey results, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain pointed to a question Harvard’s 2019 Pulse Survey, in which 65 percent of academics and faculty members “somewhat agreed, agreed or strongly agreed” that Harvard’s leaders would take “appropriate action in response to incidents of harassment and discrimination.”
Additionally, a write-in question on The Crimson’s survey asked respondents to identify “specific aspects” of their department or division’s culture that they believed needed to change. The most common answer was improving working conditions for non-tenure-track faculty — in particular, reconsidering placing time caps on their employment contracts. In addition, several respondents called for increased faculty diversity and a wider variety of pedagogical perspectives.
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the survey results.
The survey also inquired about faculty’s opinions on punishments levied against two prominent FAS faculty last year over allegations of seuxal harassment.
In May 2019, after a year-long investigation into Title IX complaints against Dominguez, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay stripped him of his emeritus status and barred him from campus.
Eighty-five percent of respondents agreed with the sanctions against Dominguez, including 59 percent who “strongly agreed.” Ninety-four percent of survey-takers from the Social Sciences, Dominguez’s division, supported the sanctions. Just one percent of all respondents disagreed, and 14 percent neither agreed nor disagreed.
Dominguez did not respond to requests for comment.
After the allegations became public, graduate students, faculty and some of the women who accused Dominguez repeatedly called on Harvard to initiate an independent, external review of the circumstances that allowed Dominguez to perpetrate misconduct. University President Lawrence S. Bacow ultimately agreed to the demand in May, and the review began in September 2019.
Three percent of respondents indicated that they had been contacted by the external review committee.
A slightly smaller majority of survey-takers, meanwhile, supported the sanctions against star Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., who Harvard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts began investigating in 2018 for verbal sexual harassment towards employees at his lab.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay placed Fryer on a two-year administrative leave in July 2019 for violating University sexual harassment policies, and also permanently closed his lab.
Sixty-six percent of respondents agreed with Gay’s sanctions against Fryer, including 33 percent who “strongly agreed.” Five percent disagreed, and 29 percent neither agreed nor disagreed.
Fryer did not respond to requests for comment.
The majority of survey respondents — 62 percent — agreed that the Harvard Corporation should revoke tenure if a faculty member is found guilty of sexual misconduct by the Office for Dispute Resolution. Opinions diverged, however, along lines of gender and position.
While 80 percent of women believed a guilty faculty member should receive the severe punishment, just 49 percent of men agreed. Likewise, more than 90 percent of assistant professors and preceptors, and more than 70 percent of associate professors and lectures, supported the sanctions, but only 42 percent of tenured faculty agreed.
Responses between the youngest and oldest age groups surveyed starkly differed. Among respondents who were 25 to 35 years old, 81 percent agreed with the sanctions. Among faculty 65 and older, meanwhile, only 36 percent agreed.
For its 2020 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 20 to 27, 2020. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,341 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in October 2019 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS titles, including emeritus, tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
Of those faculty, 476 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 416 participants answered at least one question, while 263 participants completed every question in the survey.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents, 41 percent identified themselves as women and 20 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2019 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 39 percent and 24 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
According to the Dean’s report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty — a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. By contrast, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 127 — or 9 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 7 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

Harvard College will indefinitely postpone Housing Day — an annual tradition in which freshmen students are assigned to an upperclassmen house — to prevent the transmission of the novel coronavirus, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email to students Monday.
The College has yet to announce a new date for Housing Day. The Housing Office will contact freshmen about their assignments, per Burke’s email.
“More immediately, as part of our effort to eliminate gatherings of 100 people or more, we are announcing today that Housing Day, originally scheduled for this Thursday, March 12th, will be postponed,” Burke wrote. “The Housing Office will be in touch with students about when they will receive their housing assignment.”
The email specified that, as of Monday afternoon, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus on campus.
The first confirmed cases in the region — three employees of Cambridge-based company Biogen — were announced by the company Thursday. These employees, though not residents of Massachusetts, attended a company management meeting with about 175 colleagues at a Boston hotel.
Kirkland Hoco Co-Chair Andrea J. Zhang ’22 said she understood the College is taking precaution in postponing Housing Day.
“Of course it’s an unideal scenario, but it’s also understandable given how so many other concerts, events, classes, and tests have been moved,” Zhang said.
In the email, Burke also provided guidelines for students seeking treatment in the event that they exhibit symptoms — though he wrote that Harvard University Health Services is not currently providing testing services.
“Regarding testing, please note that diagnostic testing for COVID-19 can be conducted only through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),” the email states. “At this time, HUHS is not providing testing, independent of these agencies.”
Burke also announced that, effective immediately, “non-Harvard affiliated out-of-town guests” are barred from staying on campus overnight.
Kirkland House Committee Co-Chair Maranda Ngue ’22 said in an interview Monday though she was “suspecting” a postponement, she is still “disappointed” by the announcement. She also said the house committee is “brainstorming” alternative ways to welcome freshmen to the House.
“The way that we planned for our HoCo in Kirkland was we would continue on with our plan, thinking that maybe Housing Day would happen, so either way we were ready to go,” Ngue said. “It's kind of unfortunate, but we're trying to find a way to make sure that the next incoming class of Kirklanders are very welcome here.”
The email comes on the heels of the College’s decision to cancel Visitas — Harvard’s annual admitted student weekend — over similar fears of the outbreak. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 informed admitted students in a Friday email the College will replace the event with “Virtual Visitas,” a program of videos and online events.
The University is also discouraging all non-essential international travel for spring break and strictly barred all University travel to countries with a Level 3 Travel Warning from the CDC.
Dunster House Committee Co-Chair Dylan Zhou ’22 wrote in an email that he understands the “safety concerns” behind the decision and added that the postponement is preferable to “full cancellation.”
“Dunster House still intends on hosting its traditional evening events, which include a Community Dinner, a Scavenger Hunt, a Welcome Home Stein, and Free Grille Food, on the new Housing Day,” he wrote. “The only backup plan is that we may need to split a larger group into subsets of less than 100 people.”
The next email from Harvard College on coronavirus will come Thursday afternoon, per the update schedule the College announced last week. It will include more detailed information about spring break housing, dining, and transportation, according to today’s message.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
J. Alexander White ’23 was sitting in class last week when he learned U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was dropping out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
“I heard my phone go off in class and somebody said, ‘Amy just dropped out.’ I said, ‘Oh damn.’ And then I checked my phone,” White said. “We were all just laughing about it, and I was like, ‘You know what’s tough? I’m the chairman of Harvard for Amy.’”
As candidates vied for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination amid the most crowded field in modern history, an array of student-run groups at Harvard sprang up to support various candidates. Over the past several months, many of the groups — Harvard for Amy included — knocked on doors, called potential voters, and organized campaign events to rally around their candidate of choice.
Now that the Democratic field has narrowed to a race with only a few candidates, most of the campus groups have shuttered. In several cases, the leaders of the groups wrote sign-off letters to their supporters via email, echoing the group’s vision one last time and calling for members to stay active in political advocacy.
“We were so proud to watch so many of you attend your first rally, make your first phone call, knock your first door, or convince your first family member to vote for an underdog who you believed in,” wrote Michael B. Baick ’22 and Riley S. Hoffman ’23, co-chairs of Harvard College Democrats for Pete, the group backing former South Bend, Ind. mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04. “You will never forget your firsts, but we know they will not be your last.”
“We know this result isn’t what we wanted, and it’s going to hurt for a couple of days. Right now, it is so easy to be discouraged, and to feel like all of our tireless work didn’t matter. That couldn’t be farther from the truth,” wrote Kate Travis ’22, who led a group supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Damian L. Richardson ’20, the founder of Harvard College Democrats for Kamala, said Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) led a campaign that brought a “new kind of racial diversity” into the Democratic race. He specifically pointed to a September trip to the New Hampshire Democratic convention as a highlight for the group.
“It was one of the most exciting things I’ve been on. It was a bus full of black and brown — mostly women — going to New Hampshire to support the candidate we really loved,” he said.
Richardson, who worked for Harris’s campaign last summer, said Harvard for Kamala gave many students their first experience with political advocacy.
“Most of them knocked on their first door in New Hampshire and made their first phone call in our first phone bank back in September. That initial foot in the door inspired by Kamala Harris is what’s going to bring them back, regardless of who the nominee is, to fight for the ideals that we all know are so important,” he said.

After a year marked by exciting triumphs and frustrating setbacks, Harvard wrestling took the mats at the EIWA Championships last weekend. Competing in one of the best conference tournaments in the nation, Harvard placed four wrestlers in the top eight of their weight classes and saw two freshmen punch their tickets to the National Championships. But the Crimson could not crack the top 10 as a team, finishing 12th out of 17 squads.
On the first day of competition, athletes needed to go 2-1 to advance to the next day and have a chance at making the podium. Starting at 125 for the Crimson was senior Nolan Hellickson, who missed the last two weekends of the regular season after breaking his hand in practice. Though he dropped both his matches on the day, in the eyes of Head Coach Jay Weiss, the results do not tell the full story of his contribution.
“To see Nolan come out and wrestle when he had surgery 3 weeks ago on his hand to finish his last EIWA tournament, that was great to see,” said Weiss. “This is Nolan’s fifth year. He took a year off because of injury - just talk about dedication.”
At 149, junior Zeth Dean dropped two tight decisions, each coming down to three or fewer points. At 174, first-year Pete Ferraro, who dealt with injuries all year before rejoining the starting ranks down the stretch of the season, fell to both of his opponents, including the eventual 5th-place finisher. First-year Mike Doggett lost his first round match at 184 in the overtime period before dropping another match in the consolations, and junior Evan Callahan fell in his first bout before bowing out of the tournament.
At 141, junior Lukus Stricker split his first two matches, losing a painfully close 3-2 match to Navy’s Cody Trybus, the eventual 141-pound champion, and beating Sacred Heart’s Gerard Daly 13-6. With a spot in the second day on the line, Stricker lost another tough match in overtime to Doug Zapf of Penn, who went on to come in fourth in the tournament.
“Lukus wrestled a gritty tournament,” Weiss said. “He didn’t place, but he wrestled well, he wrestled really hard.”
Wrestling at 133 pounds, freshman Michael Jaffe entered the tournament as the 10th seed but began his day by upsetting 7th-seeded Carmen Ferrante of Penn, 8-6. He then lost to Binghamton’s 2nd-seeded Zack Trampe but beat Brown’s Charles Faber to secure a spot on the podium.
Captain Hunter Ladnier entered the 157 bracket with high hopes after a season of impressive results, including being one controversial challenge call away from beating top-seeded Quincy Monday last month against Princeton. The 6th-seeded wrestler from Harvard started off the tournament by majoring Jack Stanton-Taddeo from Navy, who ended up placing 7th. Ladnier fell to eventual 157 champion Josh Humphrey from Lehigh in the quarterfinals but pinned Franklin & Marshall’s Cole Aaron to move onto Saturday.
Harvard’s freshman stars, 165-pound Phil Conigliaro and Heavyweight Yara Slavikouski, who came into the tournament with one combined loss this decade, both took care of business on day one. Conigliaro, on a first round bye, secured a major in round two and an 8-4 decision in the quarters to take him to the semifinals, while Slavikouski rested the first round before pinning his opponent in the round of 16 and grabbing a 4-1 victory in the quarters.
On day two, Slavikouski was the first to face off for the Crimson, taking on Hofstra’s Zachary Knighton-Ward. Down 1-0 going into the 3rd period, an escape from bottom position was the window Slavikouski needed to gain the upper hand over his opponent, riding a 3-1 victory into the finals. There, he met returning All-American Jordan Wood of Lehigh. The native of Belarus kept it close before a sudden takedown allowed Wood to pull away with a 9-2 win. Runner-up status gave Slavikouski an automatic bid to NCAAs, where he will likely see Wood again on his road to becoming Harvard’s first All-American since 2012.
Slavikouski’s fellow freshman Conigliaro was next on the mat for the Crimson, staring down Zachary Hartman of Bucknell in the semifinals. After losing an 8-7 heartbreaker in overtime, Conigliaro rebounded in the 3rd-place match, beating Navy’s Cael McCormic 5-4 on a tiebreaker. With the bronze, Conigliaro joined Slavikouski in securing a trip to Minnesota next week, where he also figures to be in contention for an All-American finish.
Jaffe lost to Andrew Rinne of Columbia to place eighth for the Crimson, and Ladnier, in possibly his final day as a college wrestler, split two matches to reach the fifth place match, where he took a satisfying 8-1 victory over Cornell’s Adam Santoro.
“He wrestled so hard, he just came up short,” said Weiss. “It’s been a true honor to sit in the corner with him. [He and Hellickson] mean a lot to this team and have played a huge part in the turnaround we’ve had this year.” Ladnier is now waiting to see if he can secure an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
Though the Championship came with some disappointment as several tight matches went against the Crimson, they left Lehigh’s campus with much to be proud of. For two of the Crimson, there is one more meet to go. “I think [Phil and Yara] both lost to guys that they can beat,” said Weiss. “They’re capable of doing great things.”

Adams is worth its weight in gold, and we’re not just talking about its gilded rooms. The location is ideal: far enough from the busy Yard and its tourists but close enough to your classes that you can still operate on Harvard Time. In Adams, you’ll not only get to partake in experiences like Fireside Chats in front of FDR's fireplace or perform at Drag Night — you’ll get to leave your mark by adding a mural to its underground tunnels.
All About Housing
Sophomores in Adams have been typically placed in Claverley Hall, which is currently undergoing construction and will open in August. Due to the renovations this year, sophomores have been housed all over in swing housing and in the main Adams building. Most sophomores receive n+1 housing, complete with spacious common rooms and even some kitchens. The dorms themselves will bring you back to the house’s Gold Coast era with accents like wood-etched details, fireplaces, and iron door handles. Housing will only improve after renovations are complete: the architects of Adams House’s renewal project recently revealed their plan for 79 percent of students to live in singles and 77 percent to be in suites.
As for party spaces, Adams has plenty of places to host social gatherings. The K-Space, two rooms in the F entryway basement, can hold slightly over fifty people. Adams also has the Molotov in D entryway — a red and yellow room with a bar and “Explosives” written on the door. However, the House’s best social space is probably the Adams Senior House, a three-story building seniors have the option to lottery for that is currently under construction. Best of luck to all the seniors hoping to be the first to break it in.
Community
In addition to being the house “where all the action happens," Adams has an undeniable sense of community and a contagious house pride that comes through in its 2019 Housing Day video. A favorite memory of Adams House Committee Secretary Milan M. Williams ‘21 is last year’s Housing Day event, which around 500 people — nearly the entire house — attended. She recalls the Housing Day stars performing the song from the video.
“The house loved it so much,” she said. “Everyone knew the lyrics — they were singing along and it was like a concert."
Every Thursday night, Adams House holds its stein — Carpe Noctem — for around 100 to 200 weekly attendees. Beyond Carpe, Adams hosts several annual events including Chocoholica, a Valentine’s day party centered around chocolate tasting that is one of the house’s “sweetest (and spiciest) traditions,” according to the vent announcement. One of Adams’ oldest annual events is its annual Drag Night. Historically, Adams has been a space where LGBTQ students on campus felt welcome expressing their identities. Adams House Committee Social Chair Katie M. Farkouh '21 explains that it was out of this history and on-campus community that Adams House started having an annual Drag Night.
Behind the great sense of community are the Faculty Deans Sean and Judith S. “Judy” Palfrey ’67 who are certainly beloved within the house. Katie and Milan described Sean and Judy as “phenomenal,” adding that they “engage with students all the time” and “really have our best interests at heart.” They also come to nearly every house event, so you’re sure not to miss them!
Your Questions, Answered
How would you describe your house in three words? 
MW: Inclusive.
KF: Welcoming.
MW: High Energy.
If you had to change one thing about your house, what would it be? 
KF: The K Space.
MW: Yeah, it’s been around for a while. It’s been through a lot of major parties.
KF: It becomes super, super packed and it’s in the basement. So it’s fun, you know, but at the same time, it sometimes gets a little too crazy.
Which superheroes would you say your faculty deans are most like and why?
MW: Judy’s definitely Wonder Woman. I feel like Sean can be, like, an Iron Man situation.
KF: Yeah, very selfless in every single way.
What do you hope for with the renovations?
MW: I think I hope it preserves Adams House’s character and Adams House’s history.

Amongst the undecipherable chit chat filling Annenberg, it’s quite common to hear first-years expressing their wish to be placed in Lowell House. Oh, what a dream it would be to spend the next three years living in college housing that resembles a hotel. And while the housing lottery is randomized (despite the many attempts to crack the code), we know quite a few people who have their minds set on the crème de la crème of housing: Lowell House. 
All About Housing
On the drive into Cambridge, Lowell House’s shiny blue bell tower comes into view, reminding visitors and students alike of Harvard’s architectural beauty and history. Most freshmen will be placed into other houses (and grow to love them), but a few lucky ones will be welcomed by the warm embrace of the Lowell community on Housing Day.
Just on the surface, living in Lowell House is a literal dream come true. We can assure you that the physical amenities are to die for. Sitting in the library or the JCR makes us want to open up our books and finish that p-set due tomorrow. Gym? Duh. Squash courts? Of course. Art room? C’mon. Music room? Yes. Screening room? Are you kidding?! Of course there’s a screening room; it’s the cherry on top of the delicious sundae that is Lowell House. In addition to these features, Lowell also houses pool tables, a kitchen, an opera practice room (more on this later), and a screening room (we had to repeat that because the Lowell House screening room is just that awesome).
Community
Beneath the physical surface of the newly renovated Lowell House are traditions and a sense of community that permeate throughout House life. Lowell House Committee chair Andrew Castillo ‘21, noted that “Lowell is very much encapsulated in some of its traditions.” Events include Lowell House Tea and Glowell, a rave beneath Lowell’s crystal chandeliers.
Castillo’s HoCo co-chair Ross D. Simmons ’21 likes to describe Lowell House as this “juxtaposition” of bougie and debaucherous. In addition to these events, Lowell residents participate in May Day, a pagan holiday, Trivia Nights between the Junior Common Room and Senior Common Rooms, and other unique traditions. Lowell Speeches, a newer house tradition, further fosters the sense of community amongst house residents. The Lowell House Opera is another unique feature of Lowell, as a professional opera performs in the dining hall. The party on opening night is described by Ross as “legendary.” Yule Dinner and Bacchanalia are other Lowell House specialties sure to add to Lowell House’s grandeur.
Most importantly, what would Lowell House be without the people? Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03 and Faculty Deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser are all essential to Lowell House. David and Nina are both new to their roles, but despite this, they strive to know each and every student in Lowell House and will sit down for individual meals with students to get to know them better. Though the title “Dean” has a more serious connotation, Castillo remarked that David and Nina are “welcoming” and “warm.”
While other houses have a House Committee, Lowell House has a Programming Committee whose goal is to “stimulate intellectual life” throughout the house. Famous professors and speakers, such as Stephen A. Pinker and Louis Menand, have been invited to speak and share with students topics of interest. Lowell House’s Senior Common Room is amongst the most vibrant and strong of all the houses, as it includes professors and others ranging from Drew Faust to Claudine Gay and many others. Castillo added that the Lowell tutors have been “absolutely integral to my experience [at Harvard].” Both HoCo Chairs agree that Lowell House would not be Lowell House without the tutors.
Your Questions, Answered
And now, a few more questions we just had to ask.
What have been some past Housing Day videos? 
RS: “Get Lowell.” The best housing day video ever made. There is no competition. They were still playing “Get Lowell” last year [in Annenberg on Housing Day] from 2013. Best Housing Day video. Go watch “Get Lowell” (*snaps*).
AC: We are trying to rival it this year.
Three words to describe Lowell House?
RS: Occasionem Cognosce, which is the House motto — “recognize the occasion.”
AC: Classy, but turnt.
RS: I think our words mean the same thing.
If Lowell House were a Starbucks drink, what would it be? 
RS: Caramel Macchiato
AC: We’re not a Starbucks drink. [...] I would say we’re like a cafe somewhere in LA.
If Lowell House were a restaurant in the Square, what would it be? 
AC: I would say Flour. Flour’s a good one. But also, Peet’s Coffee is pretty good too. One of those two.
RS: We are not Mather, which is clearly Pinocchio’s.
If Lowell House were an emoji, what would it be? 
AC: The little party hat one with the [confetti] blower.
RS: That’s what I was thinking.

If you’re in Quincy, there’s no need to schedule lunches eight months in advance or worry that you’ll never again be able to stare across the dhall at your crush who got Quadded. With a game room in its lobby, a retro-style Grille, an ideal central location, and a sunlit dhall that welcomes all, you’ll always find someone you know hanging out at “The People’s House.”
All About Housing
Quincy House offers the best of both worlds. It features a neo-Georgian exterior that curates a sense of bookish intrigue, along with modern and open social spaces that lie inside for Quincy residents.
Most sophomores live in hallway singles or doubles in the newly renovated Stone Hall. It is a space that also features lively common rooms, which are loved by residents like House Committee co-chair Mahalia G. Mathelier ’21. Some sophomores live in DeWolfe, Harvard’s apartment-style overflow housing; but its location across the street ensures that Quincy students stay closely integrated into the House community.
Special features of the House include the Qube, which is a raised, glass-enclosed library that overlooks the courtyard. The perfect place to settle down with a book or watch the sun gradually set, Quincy residents may almost find grinding out p-sets enjoyable.
Also overlooking the courtyard is the famed Balcony Suite. Each year, groups — typically seniors — take on a sixth floor suite with a spacious common area and a luxurious balcony — basically the ideal party space. On most weekends, Quincy residents can find a party just a few steps away from the comfort of their warm beds, which is a big change from the days of trekking out to the Quad.
Community
When asked what makes Quincy so special, HoCo co-chair Reeda Iqbal ’21 was quick to describe how Quincy has “such a great community. We all care so much about each other, and I would say a lot of people would agree that we’re very connected.” Mathelier chimed in, “Q-U-I/N-C-Y/Quincy ‘til the day I die.” They also pointed to Quincy’s reputation as “The People’s House,” as those from the Quad or River East often dine here. With dinners that are typically unrestricted, you can rest assured that you will actually see friends who you didn’t end up blocking with. And when your entryway finally does their reunion dinner here, it will feel so convenient that you might actually go.
Hallmark events such as the nerf gun game of Assassins, Cake Boss competition, lip sync battle, and Field Day are saved for Quincy residents. The House also hosts elegant Champagne Toasts and Open Houses in the faculty deans’ PentHouse. Mathelier eagerly elaborated, “The PentHouse is beautiful. Especially when the weather is nice outside, so beginning of the school year, end of the school year, the view from the balcony is beautiful.” There are also bi-weekly themed Festas that serve as a relaxed social gathering with fun themes, music, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. There are even food options like Popeyes! Other initiatives include free group outings to popular campus events like the Hasty Pudding show and Quincy Kettles, where faculty are invited to the House to meet with students.
In the dhall lobby, groups of students can always be found playing billiards or going head-to-head in ping pong or foosball. Tucked away inside the building complex, there is also a dance studio, a gym, and a pottery studio for those looking to de-stress with niche hobbies. The Grille also draws in students from all over campus who are looking to give their Board Plus a break from LamCaf. With fan-favorites like mozzarella sticks, curly fries, and rotating specialties named after notable House figures, the Grille hits the spot no matter how you’ve spent your night. Quincy resident Amanda C. Yang ’22 described her House with the three words: “Quincy — best House,” and then followed up with the four word phrase: “I love Quincy Grille.”
Your Questions, Answered 
How would you recognize a Quincy resident?
MM: If they waddled like a penguin.
RI: Aw, I love that.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House?
MM: That we are the best House.
RI: It’s amazing.
What is the biggest misconception that people have?
MM: That Lowell’s better. That’s false. Also that New Quincy is new.
RI: Yeah, because Stone Hall used to be known as Old Quincy, but now it’s Stone Hall.
If you had to change one thing about your House, what would it be?
RI: Nothing.
MM: I would start calling new Quincy New Quincy, I would end the confusion.
What food would your House be and why?
MM: Pie. We’re comforting, delicious, just the best, we’re the thing that everyone loves.
RI: Regardless of how full they are.
MM: Yeah, and we’re not ice cream, we don’t make people’s tummies hurt.
Who would the ice cream be?
RI: Mather. Well…
MM: Well, Mather is a House.
Around the House
Throughout the dhall, groups of friends catch up over a meal, a Harvard phenomenon that is less elusive for Quincy residents than it is for most. When asked to describe her House in a few words, Bente van Vlijmen ’20 came up with an impressive list: “Home, genuine, kindness, family, and clout.”
Even a non-Quincy resident admitted that the “Quincy dining hall is the place to be seen.”

With the events of the last few weeks, it may be difficult to imagine what life was like just a month ago. Somehow, though, it seems that February and March of 2020 may have more in common than we thought… In all seriousness, we wish everyone a healthy, safe, and relaxing Spring Break. And if you’re ever feeling down, Flyby will always be here to turn that frown upside down!
