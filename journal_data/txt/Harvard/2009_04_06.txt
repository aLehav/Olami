After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
North Korea’s recent attempt to launch its Kwangmyongsong-2 three stage booster rocket—which many experts have described as a civilian adaptation of its Taepodong-2 ballistic missile—should serve as a reminder of the unstable international security environment in Northeast Asia. Although the test itself was a failure—according to the New York Times, U.S. Northern Command and Japan’s Ministry of Defense, the missile fell apart in the Western Pacific—North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and its already extant launch capability should be worrisome for all concerned parties in Northeast Asia. Nevertheless, we are reassured by the Obama administration’s handling of the crisis and hope to see continued efforts in furthering nuclear nonproliferation as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.
While the North Korean test is disheartening, we are encouraged to see that the United States’ alliances with Japan and South Korea remain strong. Even more importantly, this crisis has seen Japanese and South Korean leaders unite to make a strong statement on the continued unacceptability of the North Korean nuclear program. Given the historical animosity between the two countries, it is important that these relationships remain strong for the continued stability of the region during the twenty-first century.
We are also pleased to see how President Obama has handled this challenge from the reclusive autocracy in Pyongyang. When confronted with the reality of the North Korean launch, the President renewed his calls for continued nonproliferation efforts, based on the reduction of current nuclear stockpiles, the prevention of further proliferation, and the securing of loose fissile material. In the days prior to the crisis, Obama had also deployed two AEGIS-capable destroyers to the East Sea—which can track and shoot down missiles if needed—in order to demonstrate American resolve. These actions demonstrated a combination of firm diplomacy and American military leadership.
Outside of the region, the Obama administration should make continued nuclear nonproliferation efforts a priority in its foreign policy, and should hold both allies and adversaries to a zero-tolerance standard with regard to clandestine or illegal nuclear weapons programs. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, originally opened for signature on July 1, 1968, governs the peaceful use of civilian nuclear technology in the international community and places strict safeguards on national nuclear programs, especially with regard to fissile material that could one day be used to construct a nuclear weapon.
Today, 189 countries are party to the agreement, of which five are allowed to maintain nuclear weapons. The four states that do not abide by the NPT—India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan—have all developed, or are suspected of developing nuclear weapons capabilities of some sort. The Obama administration should work with all four of these nations to bring them back into the international fold (the U.S.-India bilateral accord of 2006 is a good starting point), and hopefully persuade them to give up their nuclear armaments. 
The administration should also take strong measures to dissuade potential violators of the NPT, such as Iran, from developing nuclear weapons. There is little doubt that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—especially nuclear weapons—is one of the greatest international security challenges of the twenty-first century. Preventing terrorists and rogue states like North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons should therefore become of the primary goals of American foreign policy. Towards that end, we hope that President Obama will follow through on his bold pledge in Prague on Monday to make nuclear nonproliferation a top priority.

For students, the economic downturn has caused anxiety about the present and the future. Many undergraduates who once took for granted that their summer plans would include a high-paying internship in finance or management consulting have been forced to reconsider their futures—not only is recruitment of students down this year, but many have also started to doubt the viability of pursuing a career in these once stable industries altogether. Even seniors with full-time offers from banks and consulting firms are feeling the effects of the downturn: Companies are currently offering some members of the class of 2009 a fraction of their annual salary if they voluntarily take a year off before beginning work.The economic crisis has exposed those students interested in finance and consulting to the reality that has long faced undergraduates in other fields: Securing a summer internship or full-time job cannot always be as easy as filling out online applications through eRecruiting. Harvard’s Office of Career Services has long been criticized for catering solely to those students pursuing work in finance and consulting, while neglecting those who sought guidance in other sectors. But as the economic downturn has dramatically affected the career interests and needs of undergraduates, OCS has adapted remarkably well to a shifting demand.OCS has faced the same tightening of the belt that has affected the rest of the University. In an effort to cut operation costs, OCS is considering eliminating one-on-one counseling in July. But even amidst sweeping budget cuts across the University, OCS has adapted to the current situation with flexibility, energy, and responsiveness to the needs and desires of undergraduates.The programs and panels offered by OCS this spring have catered both to students who have been rejected from banks and consulting firms who have slashed hiring, as well as students who have been encouraged by the downturn to pursue career options in different fields. Panels on careers in alternative energy and the arts, a panel on dealing with rejection, and a workshop geared toward adjusting your plans if an offer falls through are just several of the events being sponsored or co-sponsored by OCS this April. Additionally, the new “Crimson Careers” jobs and internships database does much to streamline the process of searching and applying for jobs and internships outside of eRecruiting.The effect of these structural changes and additional offerings is profound: OCS is finally effectively assessing the needs of all undergraduates, not just those who are interested in finance and consulting. In addressing those students “displaced” by the economic downturn, it has improved its service and effectiveness on the whole. Although it is unfortunate that it took an economic crisis to get to this point, it is refreshing that the whole gamut of student concerns is now being taken under consideration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long after we’ve all forgotten what he actually did or did not do for General Motors, America will remember CEO Rick Wagoner for his injudicious use of executive privilege. Wagoner and his colleagues at Ford and Chrysler gained notoriety for flying in three separate private jets to Washington, in order to ask Congress for a multi-billion dollar bailout. Four months later, Wagoner has resigned as a condition of this bailout and been replaced by Fritz Henderson, GM’s current president and chief operating officer.
Wagoner’s resignation is perhaps not entirely deserved, since he is certainly not the only CEO who has made bad decisions and been forced to beg the government for money. But his case is a healthy reminder that even executive positions are tied to performance. Companies—and, in the case of firms that the government has bailed out, taxpayers—reserve the right to hire and fire even top-level management as they see fit.
We can’t fairly blame all of GM’s decades-long troubles on a man who has been CEO for only nine years. High cost union contracts and close competition from rivals like Toyota made Wagoner’s job a difficult one. And, to his credit, he closed unnecessary plants, laid off workers, and renegotiated union contracts in an attempt to streamline the company. But he did little to pull his company out of its unsustainable reliance on sales of sport utility vehicles and trucks, which plummeted when gas prices rose to $4 per gallon last year. It is largely this reliance that has led GM into its current crisis.
Whether it is Wagoner’s fault or not, however, GM’s current position is financially untenable. The auto company is dependent on government handouts, and there are no signs that its status will be able to stand on its own any time soon. Thousands, even millions, of jobs and a significant part of the American economy (especially the battered manufacturing sector) depend on GM remaining afloat. Whether or not pulling GM out of the red is possible at this point, though, it is clear that Wagoner is not the person for the job. By urging his resignation, the Obama administration is showing other executives that it will not allow CEOs who fail to make their companies viable to remain in their positions.
Of course, Wagoner’s “retirement” was a delicately orchestrated affair. Few people, after a career of executive perks, can complain about a pension from a company that is currently operating on taxpayer funds. A deal like this does not exactly send the message to other executives that they will be penalized for failure.
But the very fact of Wagoner’s resignation serves as a reminder that executives can be held accountable for their performance. Wagoner was one of the most visible CEOs making bad decisions and, until now, receiving little chastisement for it. While it will not likely be repeated in every company that is doing poorly, a resignation like Wagoner’s tells executives in other industries, especially corporate finance, that their jobs are still contingent on performance. If they do not lead their companies to success, they will be held responsible.
We certainly have not seen the last of the days of executive privilege and overcompensation, but the symbolic action of forcing Wagoner to step down is a move in the right direction. We know you hate to go, Rick, but your Suburban’s waiting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Technology has finally reached the point where we can customize children as if they were Build-A-Bears. Would you like eye color #00FFFF: Turquoise? Or maybe you are looking for a less traditional #00FF00: Pastel Green.. Might I suggest size 6' 1" height for your darling boy? Or maybe you’d like to explore our assortment of bundled offerings: If you act now, you can get the above-average baseball player package—50 percent off!
Thanks to the new application of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), choosing many of a child’s characteristics is now possible, according to Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg of the Los Angeles-based IVF Fertility Center. Using PGD, Steinberg and company have claimed to be able to screen for certain cosmetic characteristics, such as hair and eye color, and to modify them.
Although this capability represents a significant and laudable advance in scientific development, abuse of cosmetic trait selection has troubling social implications that need to be confronted by governments worldwide. Altering the genetic makeup of children for purely superficial purposes—rather than to avoid diseases or disorder—is ethically wrong and could give rise to a new form of discrimination. 
The practice of screening for certain diseases and disorders in unborn children and avert them is nothing new and has always been somewhat controversial. Traditionally, PGD has been used to screen for and subsequently deal with diseases and disorders like Tay-Sachs disease and Down syndrome. Thus far, the use of PGD has even gone so far as non-medical gender selection; in a recent survey, 42 percent of 137 surveyed IVF-PGD clinics reported using the practice. But the act of changing how a child looks based on arbitrary desires represents a new quandary altogether.
Giving parents the ability to pick what they consider “desirable” phenotypic traits has implications beyond family planning; as a society, we risk creating arbitrary divisions between those who have these traits and those who does not. Indeed, the entire practice smacks of eugenics programs, where humans are “bred” to represent what society considers to be desirable traits. Eugenics has become synonymous with ideas of racial purity; in Nazi Germany, programs in “racial hygiene” and the prevention of racial impurities were officially sanctioned. 
We cannot allow such a threat to become a reality through cosmetic selection. The dangers of prejudice still exist, and the effects of such arbitrary discrimination will be devastating now unless we take action. With the proliferation of cosmetic selection, certain characteristics that can be associated with different races would also be associated with different social classes, and parents would have the ability to choose from these socially stigmatized characteristics.
People who would have the option of specifying how their child looks would be able to act on their ill-gotten racial or socioeconomic prejudices. Furthermore, they would identify what they consider to be superior traits by creating them in their children. Such practices will give rise to a culture where there are superior and inferior genetic compositions—all based on who can pay for non-medical PGD. 
Additionally, the potential for social stratification inherent to the proliferation of non-medical PGD should give us even more reason to pause. PGD is prohibitively expensive—the first trait-selected baby was going to cost $18,000. The fact that PGD treatment results in a prevalence of “desirable” characteristics means that there would be visible and genetic differences between the financially well off and those whose parents could not afford PGD. If genetic makeup becomes dependent on wealth, then people’s looks will be an immediate indicator of their upbringing, and prejudices regarding someone’s background would be developed merely based on traits as inconsequential as eye color.
It is of course no secret that society is attracted to certain physical characteristics more attractive than others. Similarly, there are other markers that are indicative of financial wealth and social class without genetic differences. But trait selection is an especially dangerous practice in that it permanently brands children with characteristics that will be socially stigmatized by the very act of trait selection. 
It was because of public outrage, not laws, that Dr. Steinberg and his team suspended their eye and hair color selection program. The United States currently has no laws prohibiting cosmetic trait selection; Dr. Steinberg describes the field as “an uncharted road.” But now that designer babies are a very real possibility, it is important that we act now to prevent a human catastrophe rather than wait until Babies “R” Us becomes more than a brand for baby clothes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’re dozing in a Government class when the professor calls on you. “How were the readings?” he asks, and you scramble for an answer. The course packet lies unopened on your shelf, so you recite CliffsNotes of previous lectures to fill time. Miffed, the professor scorns your apathy, but he should expect a lack of interest: Much of political science today is dull.
Many students concentrate in Government hoping to tackle questions like “What is justice?” or “Who should rule?” Unfortunately, their courses more often dissect queries like “Does Representative X follow the constituency’s preferences on policies A, B, and C?” That’s because many political scientists consider themselves solely scientists: They describe what is, not what should be.
These professors ditched The Federalist Papers for Excel spreadsheets years ago. Initially, political scientists studied how institutions shaped human behavior. American scholars, in particular, examined the Constitution’s influence on legislators. In the 1950s, however, “behavioralists,” led by Robert Dahl, revolted. Human behavior shaped institutions, they argued, so political science could predict future events by analyzing motivations, which seemed more useful than quaint debates over checks and balances.
Today, behavioralists are less dominant, but their impact is still palpable: Political science savors a more scientific flavor. Its stockroom boasts mathematical methodology and theoretical terminology, borrowed mostly from economics and statistics. While this renovation attracts attention from other scholars, it also mars political science’s relevance outside the academy, making it uninteresting, uninspiring, and unrealistic.
First, the biggest obstacle to a broader audience is political scientists’ use of jargon. Mangled terms like “import-substituting industrialization” and “competitive authoritarianism” litter the typical textbook. In theory, these labels should make the discipline more precise, but in practice, they make it inaccessible. Not only are they hard for casual readers to understand, they also are difficult for students to remember. What is “amoral familism” again?
Second, mathematical explanations of politics conceal its larger significance. For example, take Charles Cameron’s piece on veto bargaining. You could learn about the give-and-take between the president and Congress by scrutinizing Bill Clinton’s schemes against Newt Gingrich. But Cameron reduces these highly personal exchanges to utility maximization problems. “The utility of any point in the policy space to either the president or Congress can be read from their utility functions,” he drones. His observations are nearly impossible to use: How do you find Barack Obama’s utility function?
Third, an overly scientific approach to politics makes even the most colorful characters appear gray. Former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills was an alcoholic who cavorted with an Argentinean stripper—you couldn’t make him boring. Yet, John Manley comes close in his research, outlining the theory behind “Congressional influence” instead of letting Mills illustrate it: “When one thinks about power between A and B there is a tendency to view the relationship as unidirectional,” Manley intones. “With influence, the relationship is more apt to be seen as a mutual process of stimulation.” For pages, the protagonist and his antics are never in sight. Where’s Wilbur?
In their defense, these academics are trying to cull universal lessons from particular cases, and a common vocabulary eases this task. The predictive ability that scientific methodology affords is also an asset. But some political scientists want to quantify the unquantifiable. No equation can capture the emotion essential to politics, and getting a feel for human nature from the study of history is more beneficial than tinkering with inherently flawed models. 
A less scientific approach to politics is necessary because it is more practical. Indeed, Jimmy Carter once signed an executive order that federal regulations be written “simply and clearly.” When presented with a memo directing staffers to “obscure all Federal buildings…from visibility by reason of internal or external illumination,” Franklin Roosevelt told his assistants that if a blackout occurred, “to put something across the windows.” Real leaders—and real people—do not speak in jargon.
Most importantly, when political science is more scientific, it is less political. The charts and graphs describe the status quo; they don’t define our ideals. If we focus too much on what the people want from their government, we may forget to wonder what they should want. For centuries, people have debated the proper role of government, and the significance of these questions attracts students to the field. Only humans can provide answers to these problems; science just measures the results. 
Most academics are guilty of wordiness, but political scientists study one of the most important aspects of our lives: They, more than others, need to be relevant. The impulse to measure phenomena as closely as possible is respectable, but students of government should remember Harry Truman’s quip: “Being too good is apt to be uninteresting.”

Max H.Y. Wong ’10 said he is the type of Harvard student who shops fifteen courses during the first week of the semester, and then has no idea what to take. This year, he dropped into his adviser’s office at the end of shopping period. Professor of Philosophy Edward J. Hall asked the graduate student in his office to come back another time, and immediately sat down with Wong for two-and-a-half hours to discuss his course selection.“He basically wrote all my possible courses on the board and made sense of them,” Wong said. Though Wong had initially entered Harvard intending to be a physics concentrator, he said he ended up declaring philosophy because of the quality of advising he received from the department.While poor advising is a perennial complaint among Harvard students, concentrators in the humanities laud the attention they receive from departmental advisors.Jessica C. Frisina ’10, who chose History and Literature over Social Studies and Government, said that she loves the size of the concentration, which allows for more interaction with faculty rather than just teaching fellows. “Because it’s such a small department, you don’t get lost at all,” Frisina said.Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer in History and Literature, said that the concentration is “as close to an intellectual utopia as you can get in higher education,” citing the strong student-teacher relationships.In History and Literature, sophomores are assigned one of their two sophomore tutorial leaders as their department adviser—resulting in approximately a 4:1 faculty to advisee ratio, according to McCarthy. Similarly, juniors have their junior tutorial leader as an adviser, and seniors have a guaranteed thesis adviser.“What’s interesting and rare about Hist and Lit is that the people who are advising you are the people who are teaching you,” McCarthy said. “Your adviser isn’t someone who is in a cubicle somewhere and signs your study card twice a year.”Kyle E. Wiggins ’09, also a concentrator in History and Literature, said that his advising experience “has been pretty amazing.” He attributes his experience in the department to the faculty, especially Jeanne F. Quinn, director of studies for the department. She makes herself very accessible, knows every concentrator by first name, and concerns herself with everyone’s well-being, he said.“She sets an attitude for the rest of the faculty,” Wiggins said. “The level of communication between professors and students—awareness of all the students and what they’re doing—I haven’t heard of in any concentration.”The English Department has taken a similar approach to advising. According to Director of Undergraduate Studies Daniel G. Donoghue, the concentration changed their advising system this past year from an “open door policy” of walk-in office hours to one more comparable to History and Literature.Each of the sophomore tutorial leaders in English advise the six to eight students in their class, and the department assigns each junior to a faculty advising session, said Donoghue. Under the new system students will have a choice: they can decide whether to seek an “advising conversation” with a faculty member, either self-selected or matched by the department. Next year with the curricular changes in the English department(http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525707), however, will come further changes in advising. Donoghue said that the department is in the process of designing a distribution system in which advising will still involve faculty-student interactions.“We want students to get guidance from faculty members,” Donoghue said. “They can give a good nudge for someone to take romantic poetry next year, or give an incentive to broaden [the academic path] that they would otherwise take if just left to their own devices.”The History Department is aiming to reform their advising system as well. According to Adam G. Beaver, the assistant director of undergraduate studies, there are four layers of academic advising—drop in or by appointment department advising, House advisers, department-funded events which promote interaction with faculty, and peer concentration counselors. Beaver said the department is looking to add more House-based outreach by hosting faculty lunches and historical movies in the houses.History concentrator Sergio Prado ’09, said that he has been satisfied with the advising in the department.“The professors and the people who deal with the administration definitely have a lot of concern for the students,” he said.—Staff writer Victor W. Yang can be reached at vyang@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA) hosted its first annual Ruffin Dinner last Friday to honor two individuals who embodied service, leadership and creativity in law during a transformative period in United States history.The honorees, actor Voltaire R. Sterling, who graduated from the Law School in 2005, and Judge Joyce London Alexander Ford, spoke to dinner guests on the importance of social activism and minority leadership under President Obama.“In an unprecedented manner, the Obamas have charged us to ensure that the change we wish to see in this community is ultimately brought about by us,” Sterling said. “We now have a duty to answer Obama’s challenge.”Ford also urged attendees to actively combat existing social prejudices. “Though times have changed, people haven’t changed,” she said. “Our President transmogrified the land. But if he is to succeed, we have a lot to do.”BPLA Finance Director Crystalee J. Forbes ’11, called Ford a “pioneer in her own right, a leader who embodied the ideals she espoused.”Ford received the Charles Hamilton Houston Award for life-long leadership and service to the betterment of the African American community. She was the first African-American Chief United States Magistrate Judge and served the District for Massachusetts for nearly thirty years.Sterling was presented with the Horizon Award for creativity in using his law degree to pursue an acting career. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he was handpicked by Denzel Washington to appear in his film, “The Great Debaters.”Though Sterling did not have an agent or manager at the time of casting, he said his experience at Morehouse College and Harvard Law School prepared him to independently seek a career in the otherwise rigid film industry.“One thing I learned is that there is always a way. You look at people who have come before, and they have always found a way,” Sterling said in an interview.Two of those “who have come before,” Sterling said, were the dinner’s eponyms: G. Lewis Ruffin, the first black graduate of Harvard Law School, and his wife Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin,an abolitionist and women’s suffragist.“I am excited, honored, but also deeply humbled to receive this award,” Sterling said in the interview. “I think back to the pioneers who have come before me, and realize how much greater this moment is for me.”The Ruffin Dinner, which BPLA plans to continue as an annual tradition, aims to honor individuals who exhibit the commitment to service and the pursuit of justice exemplified by the Ruffins.Dwight B.N. Pope ’10 was also awarded the $500 BPLA Student Scholarship Award for academic success, service and interest in law during the event.

“My goal is to make ‘Beantown,’ green town,” said Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino, as he kicked off the Harvard Graduate School of Design’s weekend-long conference last Friday. The conference, entitled “Ecological Urbanism: Alternative and Sustainable Cities of the Future,” was the largest in the school’s history.The conference addressed a variety of issues concerning the evolution of cities in a world where sustainability is becoming a larger concern for planners. The event hosted speakers from a variety of disciplines including architecture, ecology, literature, history, and economics. “The conference had to include a certain balance of some of the best practices and ideas technologies, and sensibilities we thought we be important in terms of the future,” said GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi.According to Mostafavi, the main goal of the conference was to present a new type of thinking that could influence instruction at the GSD as well as the world outside of the school. Another overhanging goal, however, was to show how ecological urbanism and sustainability can be “responsive to needs of society and also fun.” “We want to show that sustainability and ecology is not purely technical, and it should be enjoyable, to show how can sustainability provide pleasure,” said Mostafavi.Mostafavi and Menino gave introductory remarks Friday afternoon. The following lectures and panel discussions were organized by themes with titles such as Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Ecological Urbanism; Productive Urban Environments; Mobility, Infrastructure, and Society; Curating Resources; Engineering Ecology; and What Next.“One of the main aims was to move understanding of ecology beyond the environmental,” said Gareth G. Doherty, the conference director and a doctoral student at the GSD.The keynote speakers of the event were Rem Koolhaas, a professor at the GSD, and Homi Bhabha, the director of the Center for the Humanities. The event began with a roundtable discussion and proceeded with five panel discussions and a variety of informal Saturday lunchtime discussions.Sold out within weeks of its announcement, the conference attracted guests from around the world, and enthusiasm was high, according to Mostafavi.“After five days, I could still feel that level of enthusiasm and energy, could feel the energy day after day,” he said.An Ecological Urbanism exhibit, on display until April 17, provides an interactive way to approaching these topics. The GSD also plans to release a book in late October that discusses topics under ecological urbanism as well as others the conference was not able to cover.—Staff writer Emma R.

Over five hundred walkers came together on Saturday for the Sixth Annual Walk for Haiti, successfully raising over $40,000 dollars for Harvard-affiliated international healthcare organization Partners in Health (PIH), according to Karen Fritsche, the walk’s co-founder.This year’s theme was “Housing for Haiti,” as 100 percent of the funds will be used to rebuild homes in Haiti, where land and infrastructure were devastated by two hurricanes last summer, Fritsche said. She estimated the three-mile walk along the Charles River raised enough money to build at least eight houses.In previous years, money raised has been used to purchase operating room lights, construct housing, and fund scholarships to support 1,200 Haitian students.“Every year we ask the PIH what they need most,” said Fritsche. “Whatever we can do, we do.”PIH was founded in 1987 by Harvard Medical School Professors Paul Farmer and Jim Y. Kim, who was recently selected as president of Dartmouth, and three other individuals. The event began at noon at St. Paul Church on Mt. Auburn Street with a speech from HMS assistant professor Joia Mukherjee, medical director of PIH. The talk detailed Haiti’s historical struggles for freedom, first from slavery, and now from poverty. “Haiti still struggles for liberation, and PIH’s insistence on a better model for healthcare is an example of that,” said W. Gerald McElroy, a current Yale senior who co-founded the walk with Fritsche while a sophomore in Fritsche’s French class at Lincoln Sudbury Regional High School in Cambridge.Those in attendance gathered for a moment of silence before starting the walk to remember all those who have died or are suffering in Haiti.According to Bob Doolittle, the youth director at St. Paul and one of the event’s coordinators, the walk raised $40,000, significantly more than the goal of $25,000. He said that this year was the second-most successful showing since the walk’s founding in 2003.“With the economic downturn people were going to hold back, but the reverse happened,” he said.An anonymous donor from Lincoln Sudbury agreed to match two dollars for each dollar students from the high school raised up to $10,000, a gift organizers called “key” to the walk’s success. Over twenty churches, Young Haitians United, members of the local community, and more than a dozen schools participated. “Even if the economy tanks, whatever we contribute, it’s something they didn’t have. And it makes a big different in Haiti,” Fritsche said.Next year’s walk is scheduled to take place on March 27. —Staff writer Helen X. Yang can be reached at hxyang@fas.harvard.edu.

Between the thoughtful discussions of film aficionados and the gentle hum of the projector, the Student Organization Center at Hilles  Cinema buzzed with activity this weekend as enthusiasts joined student directors and producers for the inaugural Harvard Undergraduate Film Festival. Twenty-two short films were presented over the two-day festival, with submissions in fiction, documentary, stop-motion animation, and hand-drawn animation—as well as one music video. The event, a collaborative effort of SOCH administrators and several student organizations, was a welcome breath of fresh air at the chronically under-used student space. Colleen F. O’Brien ’11, the events coordinator at the SOCH who spearheaded the event, said that the festival owes its existence primarily to former manager David R. Friedrich’s initiative to revitalize the SOCH and its image. “When I was originally hired as an events coordinator at the SOCH, this was one of several programming ideas that [David] had on the table,” O’Brien said. O’Brien added that in planning the event, coordinators didn’t specifically target students in the Visual and Environmental Studies department, who give their own end-of-semester screenings for class-based work. “It’s great that the VES students have a screening opportunity, but we wanted that platform to be available to everyone,” she said, also noting that with submissions from both a graduate and a VES professor, the festival was not limited to undergraduate filmmakers.And although the festival’s predominant spirit was not one of competition, several outstanding submissions will be recognized with accolades presented later this week.	The festival’s co-sponsors included Harvard Undergraduate Television, the Havardwood Undergraduate Student Organization, and the Cinematic, Harvard’s annual undergraduate film publication. Derek M. Flanzraich ’10, one of HUTV’s co-presidents, said that his organization was truly eager to contribute. “We were really excited about the idea of having a film festival or any opportunity to showcase student work,” Flanzraich said. In addition to helping with logistics and supplying content, Flanzraich added “We also had a lot of our members of our organization showcasing work.” —Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

Students seeking to work for the Q Guide this summer had their hopes dashed when Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced last Thursday that the College will drastically alter the format of next year’s guide, eliminating the need for student involvement in the guide’s creation.In an e-mail sent to summer applicants last Thursday, Q Guide editor Charles C. Bridge ’11 wrote that the change in content and move to an online-only edition meant that no students would be hired to work for the publication.“This means that there will be no Q Guide staff this year—not only do Alex and I no longer have jobs to offer any of you, but our own jobs have vanished,” Bridge wrote in the e-mail. “The whole not-yet-complete Q staff just got laid off, basically.”According to the e-mail, Bridge said he and Q Guide co-editor Alexander E. H. McNaughton ’11 had learned of the extent of the changes to the Q Guide on Wednesday, just before the information was released to the public.“If this news makes you feel shocked, deceived, and as if you wasted your time, I can completely empathize because, frankly, I feel the same way,” Bridge wrote.Bridge and McNaughton had met with the administration to discuss the decision to cut the printed version of the Q Guide, but they had not been told about plans to alter the guide’s format, said Douglas R. Lloyd ’09, a two-year veteran of the Q Guide who was helping advise this year’s editors.According to an e-mail sent to students by Harris, the new version of the Q Guide will contain extensive numerical data and the full text of all student responses to the question of whether students would recommend the course to their peers. “Regardless of the merits of this new system, we feel that the reduction of the Q Guide to only numerical evaluations and one full-text response will be detrimental to the informed choice of courses by students,” said a statement released by former  Q Guide editors in chief Lindsey R. Canant ’09, Ginger E.R. Tanton ’09, and Russell I. Krupen ’07 and Lloyd, a former assistant editor in chief.According to Tanton, the administration has been proposing to alter the format of the Q Guide for years, but she and other editors had pointed out the dangers of printing full text answers, some of which contain obscenities.Tanton said administrators told her that they would omit obscene comments, which she said would lead to bias against negative responses.Annie E.P. Stone ’10 and Anna Marie Wagner ’11, two of about 40 students who applied to work for the Q Guide this summer, said it was somewhat frustrating that the administration did not notify applicants of the change sooner. However, both thought that the news was most damaging to Bridge and McNaughton, the only two students who had officially been hired.Tanton and Lloyd said they understood the administration’s desire to save money by ending the print edition and cutting student staff, but they expressed concern over how the end of student involvement will affect the legitimacy of the new version of the Q Guide. “It’s always been the way that students can keep a check on the administration,” Lloyd said. “Taking it out of students’ hands will make it so much less reliable. I feel like it’s very disturbing that the administration now has complete control over releasing the evaluation data.” —Staff writer Lauren D. Kiel can be reached at lkiel@fas.harvard.edu.

In addition to receiving $5.2 million in compensation from hedge fund D.E. Shaw and $2.7 million in speaking fees, former Harvard President and professor Lawrence H. Summers also received nearly $600,000 in salary from the University this past year—only slightly less than what he was earning prior to his 2006 resignation as Harvard’s head.According to White House public financial disclosure reports—available because Summers now serves as director for President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council—Summers received $586,996 in salary as the Charles W. Eliot University professor in 2008 and 2009. According to the report, he held the position at Harvard from 2001 until January of this year.Excepting Summers, the University’s highest-paid professor in 2007 was Business School Professor W. Earl Sasser, who received $416,148 in compensation and employee benefits as well as a $335,000 expense account. According to the Department of Education, the average salary of a full professor at Harvard in 2006 was $165,149. Summers served as president at Harvard through fiscal year 2006, when he earned $610,556 in compensation and benefits and received nearly $100,000 in his expense account, according to publicly available tax information required from non-profit institutions. Under the terms of his resignation, he then received $610,586 in paid sabbatical for the following year, as well as over $143,000 for moving expenses, loan interest subsidies, and other allowances. According to Summers’ Web site at the Harvard Kennedy School, he writes a monthly column for the Financial Times, co-edits the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, serves as a managing director of D.E. Shaw, and serves on a number of not-for-proft and for-profit boards.A “Statement on Outside Activities of Holders of Academic Appointments” from the Provost’s Web site notes that faculty members and other academic appointees are hired under “the expectation that [their] primary professional duties are to Harvard, and that outside professional activities will not conflict with obligations to one’s students, to colleagues, and to the University as a whole.” Though paid consulting for other educational institutions requires permission from the faculty member’s Dean and the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—customary professional service “generally poses no serious conflicts and may be undertaken without prior approval.”But as a guideline, “no more than 20 per cent of one’s total professional effort may be directed to outside work,” and the “nature of specific activities and the individual’s role in them” may also be examined to avoid possible conflicts of interest.While recent salaries of other University officials have not yet been released, Harvard’s highest paid employee in 2007 was Christopher M. Gordon, chief operating officer for the Allston Development Group, who received $587,172 in compensation for a job cited as requiring an average of 40 hours per week. University Provost Steven E. Hyman earned nearly $550,000 in salary that year for a job averaging 70 hours a week.Documentation regarding Summers in the 2006 tax filing states that “Harvard provides the President with a home in Cambridge and requires him to use it as a condition of employment for the convenience of the University,” and as such does not provide any compensation for such purposes. But subsidies are included for housing outside of Cambridge, as well as “legal expenses, personal travel, loan interest subsidies and retirement gifts.” With Summers’ resignation, the University agreed to provide him with “access to a mortgage loan on a personal residence consistent with University practice,” according to the tax filing. The report shows that Summers took out a 20-year loan for $1 million in 2006 to purchase a home that requires interest-only payments from 2010 to 2014, and then principal and interest payments afterwards. In 2002, Hyman—who is not provided a house by the University—took out a 30-year, $750,000 loan from the University to purchase a home that requires him to pay back “principal plus appreciation at sale or maturity.”Summers’ tenure as president, the shortest since the Civil War, ended in June 2006 with his resignation after heated struggle with members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In addition to his statement that “issues of intrinsic aptitude” may explain the underrepresentation of women in science and engineering leadership positions, he was criticized for his ambiguous role in a federal fraud scandal involving economics professor and friend Andrei Shleifer ’82, as well as his reported firing of former Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby.Summers, who became a tenured professor at Harvard at age 28 and is regarded by many as one of the nation’s most brilliant economists, returned to Cambridge as a University professor in 2007. Derek C. Bok, who led Harvard from 1971 to 1991, stepped in as interim president following Summers’ resignation.—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

The usual Saturday morning bustle of Harvard Square was disrupted when Cambridge Police and the Cambridge bomb squad swarmed the area in response to a bomb threat.Police closed down Massachusetts Avenue, the Harvard Square MBTA stop, and several nearby Square businesses.“Where the T stop was, there must have been like eight or 10 SWAT cars and a big squad car parked there,” said Pierce E. Tria ’10. Tria said he saw Harvard and Cambridge police officers cordoning off Holyoke and Mount Auburn Streets.The scare was precipitated by a call to Cambridge police made by a pedestrian early Saturday morning, according to Nick Nicholas, an employee of the Crimson Corner newsstand.  The pedestrian heard a ticking noise coming from the two mailboxes outside of the Harvard Square Bank of America, Nicholas said, and the source of the ticking was later discovered to be a “clicker” placed in one of the mailboxes.A “clicker” is an electronic device often used in restaurants to alert patrons when their table is ready, another Square employee said.The Cambridge Police Department could not be reached for comment over the weekend.The Harvard Square Finagle A Bagel, CVS, Sovereign Bank and Bank of America were all closed from approximately 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., according to Reda Bichri, an employee of The Body Shop. The Harvard Coop and Crimson Corner News Stand also closed for this timeframe, Nicholas said. Red line trains bypassed the Harvard Square station for those two hours, a transit worker said, and all Harvard Yard gates along Mass. Ave from Johnston Gate to the Widener gate were also closed, according to Harvard security personnel.The last bomb scare to threaten University property occurred in February 2000, when a phoned-in bomb threat and reports of a suspicious smell caused the evacuation of two Harvard Extension School buildings.—Staff writer Emily J.

Embracing what one event co-founder called an “alternative way of settling our differences,” the Harvard College Democrats and Harvard Republican Club participated in their fourth annual “Paintball Brawl” last Friday, with the Republicans emerging victorious for the fourth time in a row.
“It was a bit of a massacre once again,” said Daniel A. F. Demetri ’09, a Democrat who, along with his Republican roommate Zachary V. Smith ’09, organized the first-ever brawl during his freshman year. “Dems are just worse with guns,” he said.
The Democrats and Republicans, clad in blue and red gear respectively, chartered a school bus to take them to Boston Paintball in Everett. The Republicans won six out of the seven rounds, a particularly impressive victory due to their low turnout: 14 Republicans against 24 Democrats.
Nonetheless, the Democrats were proud of their performance on the field.
“I’d like to say we held our own,” said Lindsay M. Garber ’11, who organized the event for the Democrats. “We kept it close a couple times, but they were very clearly the winners and we gave them props for that.”
The game proved to be cathartic for the Republicans after the party’s defeat in the November presidential election. 
“We were saying, ‘Hey we may have lost the election, but we can still win paintball,’” said HRC President Colin J. Motley ’10.
Motley said that aggressive political talk was mostly absent from the event. 
“It was very collegial and fun,” he said.
The game marked a bittersweet moment for Demetri as it was the last time he could participate in the tradition that he co-founded. As freshmen, he and Smith raised more than $3,000 from corporate sponsors in order to begin the annual paintball challenge. 
“The ultimate irony is that I’m going to be working for a hedge fund next year that owns most of the paintball manufacturing factories in the country,” he said.
Even after its founders have graduated, the spirit of friendly Democrat-Republican rivalry will remain. Motley said he plans to publicize the paintball brawl to incoming freshman during a debate between the Democrats and Republicans on prefrosh weekend, while Garber said that the Democrats and Republicans are considering organizing a laser tag event for next year as well.
“I think a little healthy competition is good for us,” she said.

It was a strange sight in Harvard Square—a tree outside of Peet’s Coffee had four vouchers for free burgers and fries from b.good taped to it. Seconds later, b.good CEO and co-founder Jon J. Olinto updated the company’s Twitter account “b_good_” with a cellphone picture and an invitation for its 151 Twitter followers to come claim the vouchers.Twitter, a three-year-old microblogging service, has millions of users who post steady streams of short updates called “tweets” that are limited to 140 characters. Twitter’s user base swelled 900% last year. Companies, in turn, are quickly catching onto the service as a marketing tool.“There’s so much opportunity to have dialogue with people in a very authentic way. That’s the cool thing about Twitter,” Olinto said. “Most companies have to speak in press releases...[but Twitter] allows you to be yourself.”LET’S GET PERSONALIZEDTwitter’s form of communication can provide uniquely personalized dialogue with customers. On April 1, a disgruntled Boloco customer tweeted the chain’s account, writing, “True story: There was tin foil in my soy smoothie today. It was not delicious.”Within hours, CEO and co-founder John Pepper tweeted back under username “boloco”: “hi there, sorry about that. foil not part of recipe. [Direct message] me your boloco card #... thanks!” Pepper’s 840 followers also saw the tweet.But the communication between CEO and customer is not always about resolving ill will. When one Boloco fanatic tweeted about “annihilating my previous ‘# of burritos in a week’ record,” Pepper invited him to message him for free burritos to continue his winning streak.“I don’t look at it like marketing. I look at it as dialogue,” he said. “It’s sort of a natural extension of what I should be doing anyway. This is a more efficient way to do it.” Oggi’s Gourmet in the Holyoke Center, a restaurant that specializes in pizza, has a Twitter account run primarily by its co-founders Steve R. Welch and Bill Warner under the username “oggigourmet.”“The marketing tool that Twitter gave us was to be able to say less tailored things, talking in slang to students, and they would accept it more,” Welch said.The Harvard Book Store also keeps a Twitter at “harvardbooks” of events and updates written in a friendly, casual tone. Diana G. Kimball ’09, a Twitter user with a passion for the Internet, agreed with the importance of humanizing a company through Twittering.“You can’t just use it as a advertising platform,” she said. “I really have to feel like there’s a person behind it.” THE PERKS OF BEING A TWEETERB.good’s twitter runs special promotions, including playing Twitter hide-and-seek with burger vouchers around Boston.Over the weekend, Olinto offered free sweet potato fries from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Friday at its Harvard Square location. He found the number of people who responded to the experiment—thirty—somewhat disappointing, but will continue to roll out promotions.Eric C. Chen ’11 is a b.good follower who was already a customer when he discovered the chain’s account. “I like the fact that this is a local restaurant trying to reach out to us,” he said, adding that he would check out future promotions.Oggi’s Welch has also run promotions, but out of 180 followers, only two came in over the course of a two-hour slot to claim their free slice of pizza with code word “London broil.”Oggi’s, which markets itself more to Square professionals, has seen an increase in interest from student customers as a result of its recent use of Twitter, according to Welch. Customers have also come in to the restaurant to chat after following his posts on the Web site, he said.While Welch and his co-owner both tweet, he said that they sometimes hands over the task to the store’s public relations representative when they are too busy.But the business ramifications of using Twitter as an advertising vehicle are still unclear. “Honestly, I can’t say that we’ve had any more business through Twitter than any other advertising,” he said. “Twitter can be effective if you have many, many followers and they’re in tune to your company.”And although the service has provided a valuable new mode of informal communication, Welch said it is not going to replace their traditional print advertising anytime soon. The plus side?“It doesn’t cost us anything to tweet,” he said.—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

A drag king, dressed in black slacks with a pink stripped long sleeve shirt, and a drag queen, in a black and pink top with gold heels, taught students the art of gender-bending yesterday at a workshop sponsored by the Women’s Center, the Trans Task Force and the Queer Students and Allies.The presentation was part of a senior project by Lisa J. Miracchi ’09, who said it was an opportunity for the three groups to collaborate.Miracchi said she chose this month to hold the workshop since it is “Quapril” for the QSA, a month in which the organization raises awareness about issues affecting gay, lesbian and transgender people.During the event, drag king Haywood Wakefield and drag queen Fena Barbitall gave a presentation about their lives and then split the attendees into two groups to teach them how to dress in drag.Barbitall took the men into a separate room and spoke about being a drag queen performer, saying that she hoped that students would gain insight into drag culture. Meanwhile, Wakefield spoke about the process of dressing as a drag king, discussing issues from “packing a pud” to “building a tummy” as alternatives to breast binding while performing on stage. Trans Task Force (TTF) Chair Eva B. Rosenberg ’10 said that for her, the event was about more than just learning how to correctly dress in drag; it was a chance to appreciate the art behind it and to allow her to experiment with her gender.Rosenberg said that the TTF supported the drag workshop because it is trying to raise awareness of the fact there are people out there “who don’t fit into boxes of male or female.”Echoing this sentiment, Women’s Center Director Susan B. Marine said she hoped students would learn that gender is something that can be playful.Gender “is not just what we all wake up with, it’s fun and creative. I hope workshops like these let people explore things that sometimes aren’t typically encouraged,” she said.Morgan L. Haven-Tietze ’10 said she attended the workshop for fun and partially out of curiosity. Haven-Tietze is a regular attendee of the Women Center’s activities and said she was excited that there was an event in which issues involving the Women’s Center, the TTF and the QSA could be discussed in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere.After the event, Miracchi said, “we live in a very gendered society and I hope people just felt like there are avenues to explore new sides of themselves.”

Senior Day for the Harvard baseball team isn’t until the end of the month, but that didn’t stop the Crimson’s elder statesmen from stealing the spotlight in Saturday’s doubleheader against Cornell at O’Donnell Field.Captain Harry Douglas came through with key hits in the final inning of each game, Matt Rogers continued his recent run of scorching play with a pair of long balls, and Taylor Meehan and Tom Stack-Babich each hit walk-off homers in a thrilling sweep of the Big Red (4-16, 2-6 Ivy).Meehan capped off a five-run ninth with a two-run shot in Game 1 to bring Harvard all the way back from a 5-1 deficit and give the team a 6-5 victory.Stack-Babich took his classmate’s cue in the nightcap—stepping up to the plate with the score tied at five and a man on base in the bottom of the ninth and hammering the ball over the centerfield fence to complete the sweep with a 7-5 Harvard win.“Oh, was it exciting,” said an ecstatic Crimson coach Joe Walsh. “It’s nice to see two comebacks. We were down a bundle of runs in both games...but] we honed in there and hit them late.”HARVARD 7, CORNELL 5After the Crimson came all the way back from a 4-0 hole with five runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Big Red reclaimed the momentum in the seventh when third baseman Nathan Ford smashed a game-tying home run the opposite way to right field off of Harvard freshman reliever Jonah Klees.But if Cornell had any ideas of taking the contest into extra innings, Stack-Babich had other plans.The right fielder stepped into the batter’s box after Douglas laced a two-out single through the left side of the infield to keep the Crimson at the plate. Stack-Babich took full advantage of the opportunity, crushing a towering home run out to center field to give Harvard its second walk-off win of the day.“It was good that we won right way,” Stack-Babich said. “You’re kind of down after [losing the lead in the ninth], and you don’t want to hang around for too long.”The game started off as a pitcher’s duel between Harvard rookie Conner Hulse and the Big Red’s Matt Hill, who maintained a scoreless battle through five innings. Hulse relented in the sixth, giving up three runs, two of which came off a Domenic DiRicco homer. Cornell picked up another run in the seventh to take a 4-0 lead.But the Crimson bats woke up in the bottom of the frame in a big way, on the strength of a power surge from Harvard’s top two sluggers.With the Crimson down 4-1, Rogers came up to the plate with a runner on base and blasted a shot through an antagonistic wind in left field. Two batters later, Stack-Babich followed suit with a tape-measure long ball out to left center for his first homer of the game, giving the Crimson a 5-4 advantage.Ford almost stole the show with his ninth-inning dinger, but Stack-Babich one-upped him in the bottom of the frame to cap off an outstanding day for him and his classmates.“Seeing our seniors come through that way, that’s a real strength for your ballclub when your seniors can come up big like that,” Walsh said. “I hope that carries on to the rest of the classes.”HARVARD 6, CORNELL 5The flair for the dramatic that the Crimson displayed on Saturday first manifested itself in the seventh and final inning of Game 1 against the Big Red.Down 5-1 after a sixth-inning Rogers homer got the team on the board, Harvard looked to be in dire straits coming into last licks. But the Cornell defense fell apart early in the inning, giving the Crimson all the help it needed to mount an impressive comeback.Three Big Red errors and timely run-scoring singles by senior Jon Roberts and sophomore Dillon O’Neill brought Harvard within two and the winning run to the plate in Meehan.While Meehan’s contributions to the Crimson’s efforts throughout his career have predominantly been his high batting average and on-base percentage, as well as his solid defense at second base, on Saturday he eschewed his usual weapons of choice in favor of the long ball. On a 2-1 pitch from Cornell’s David Rochefort, the lefty Meehan pulled the ball deep to right field and out of the park for Harvard’s first of two walk-off shots on the day.“That was huge,” Stack-Babich said. “Especially in the first game to get some momentum. We really needed that.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard baseball team (7-18, 5-3 Ivy) split two games against the Princeton Tigers (9-13, 2-6) on Sunday, losing the first game 3-1 and winning the second game 13-12 in 17 innings.  Senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich provided clutch hitting for Harvard in the second game, hitting a game-tying home run in the thirteenth inning, as well as the game-winning single.“Anytime we can beat Princeton—more importantly in a late inning game—it’s just something to build upon,” Walsh said, after the 513-pitch affair. “I don’t think there will be a game this year—no matter what the score is—that we’re not going to feel like we have a shot, especially the way our bats are going.”HARVARD 13, PRINCETON 12In a game that seemed like it would never end, Stack-Babich once again provided the heroics for the Crimson. Stack-Babich had six hits in the 17-inning nightcap, but none bigger than his walk-off single to win the game for Harvard, 13-12, over the Tigers. The victory for the Crimson came nearly four-and-a-half hours after the first pitch was thrown.  In the bottom of the 17th inning with Harvard down, 12-11, senior Matt Rogers tied the game on a single with no outs and the bases loaded. Captain Harry Douglas came up next, popping out and giving Stack-Babich the chance to be the hero once again.Stack-Babich did not squander the opportunity, driving the ball into the right center field gap to give Harvard the 13-12 win.“With one out and bases loaded—only needing one run—it’s kind of a nice situation,” Stack-Babich said. “I felt pretty good.  There’s not a lot of pressure.  You don’t even need to get a hit—you just need to get a fly ball, and he gave me a pretty good ball to hit.”Harvard was dominant in the game’s first five innings, scoring three runs in the fourth and five in the fifth to jump out to a commanding 8-0 lead. But the Tigers halved the Crimson’s advantage in the sixth, stringing together four hits and a walk with two outs and a runner on third to make the game 8-4.Both teams went scoreless in the seventh and eighth innings, and Princeton trailed by four heading into the ninth.  The Tigers’ Dan DeGeorge led off the ninth inning with a home run, but rookie reliever Jonah Klees, who had entered the game for Zailskas with two outs in the sixth, quickly retired the next two batters. But Klees then walked the following two hitters and was relieved by Stack-Babich.The game’s eventual hero, though, was almost its goat, allowing the Tigers to climb all the way back and even the score.Harvard went down in order in the frame’s bottom half, and the game headed to extra innings tied, 8-8.Neither team was able to score until the 13th inning, when sophomore Daniel Berardo relieved Stack-Babich, inheriting runners on first and second with one out. Berardo allowed the Tigers to load the bases for Matt Connor, who scorched a single up the middle, bringing home two Tigers for Princeton’s first lead of the game, 10-8.The bottom half of the inning saw two quick outs for the Crimson.  Down to its last chance, Harvard battled back. Douglas popped a ball into shallow left field, which the shortstop was able to get a glove on but could not haul in. Stack-Babich stepped to the plate, and the senior drilled a two-strike pitch over the right field fence to tie the game, 10-10.“I was just hoping he would give me something out over the plate, and he did,” Stack-Babich said. “It just felt great to tie it up.”Freshman Jeff Reynolds relieved Berardo to begin the fifteenth inning. Two quick singles led to Princeton’s having runners at the corners with no outs. Stack-Babich made a nice running catch on the right field line for the first out of the inning, and the following batter hit the ball back to Reynolds, who knocked it down and threw home to get the runner trying to score from third. Reynolds then got a groundball to second base to end the inning unscathed. Harvard had survived again.The top half of the game’s final frame began with a Tiger ground out to shortstop. The next batter, Tom Boggiano, rocketed a ball down the third base line, and Douglas, the third baseman, made a great stab on it. But Douglas overthrew first base and Boggiano advanced to second. A passed ball moved Boggiano over to third base, and he scored on a triple by Connor. The Tigers then took a two-run lead when Connor scored on a sacrifice fly.But it was Stack-Babich’s game to shine, and the senior slugger was not to be outdone, adding to his gaudy production on the day with a clutch, walk-off single to give Harvard the win and help the team avoid a sweep and an embarrassing meltdown.HARVARD 1, PRINCETON 3In the first game of the doubleheader, Princeton struck first.  In the third inning, an RBI double gave Princeton the 1-0 lead. Princeton scored again in the fifth inning, when Connor hit a solo home run to right field.The Crimson got on the board in the bottom of the fifth, when Rouches doubled in O’Hara, who had also doubled to reach base. But Harvard was unable to further close the gap.Princeton increased its lead to 3-1—the game’s final score—on a lead off home run in the sixth inning. Both Princeton’s David Palms and Harvard’s Brent Suter tossed complete games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once again, it took the Harvard bats just a little too long to wake up.
In a battle of the Ivy League’s top two teams, the Crimson softball squad and Cornell (26-6, 5-1 Ivy) split a twinbill Saturday afternoon at a windy Soldiers Field.
Strong pitching highlighted the opener, as Big Red hurler Elizabeth Dalrymple pitched a complete-game shutout to beat Harvard and its freshman ace Rachel Brown, 3-0.
But the Crimson offense came alive in the nightcap, putting up nine hits to snap Cornell’s 15-game win streak with a 6-5 victory.
“It was a battle,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “Two good-hitting teams, they shut us down the first game, and we came right back and scored a bunch of runs in the second and jumped on them. That was good for us.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 5
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, holding on for a one-run win that marked the Big Red’s first loss of the Ivy season.
After sophomore Emily Henderson was hit by a pitch in the first inning, rookie Whitney Shaw launched a shot to right-center to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
“To come out, score in the first inning, being ahead 2-0 in the first inning was really huge, and then every inning on thereafter, just don’t give them an inch,” co-captain Hayley Bock said. “Obviously we needed every run we got.”
The Crimson doubled its lead in the bottom of the second, when Bock got things started with a single up the middle. After Bock advanced to second base on a groundout from rookie Jane Alexander, junior Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, ran out an infield single and stole second base.
Henderson laid down a bunt single to plate Bock, and Krysiak came home on an error from the Cornell shortstop.
The Big Red broke through in the fourth inning against freshman Julia Moore, who came on in the third to relieve junior Margaux Black, who opened the game with two scoreless frames.
Moore allowed two singles and plunked Cornell’s Ali Tomlinson to load the bases with no outs.
Co-captain Bailey Vertovez pitched a third of an inning before Brown entered the game to get the final two outs, but the Big Red plated three to make it a one-run game at 4-3.
Harvard tacked on two more in the bottom of the fifth. With the bases loaded and one out, Bock dropped a single into left field to score Shaw and junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
“It’s obvious what we needed to do,” Bock said of the team’s offensive breakthrough in the second game. “It’s just a matter of playing with heart and getting it done.”
Cornell got back within one in the top of the seventh on a two-run bomb from Jessy Berkey, but Brown struck out Tomlinson to get the save in 3.2 innings of relief.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 0
Brown struggled in her first Ivy start at home, and the Harvard offense offered the rookie little support as the Big Red easily took the first game, 3-0.
The troubles for the Crimson started in the top of the first, as Brown uncharacteristically hit the first two Cornell batters. 
The pair came home on an Ashley Garvey single to jump out to the early 2-0 lead.
Brown settled down to earn the last two outs by strikeout, but the damage was done.
“[Brown] struggled at the beginning of Game 1,” Allard said. “She wasn’t getting her rise ball spins working. It was a struggle the whole first game, so we gave her the opportunity with the lead [in Game 2] just to try to continue to work on things.”
Brown went the distance, allowing one more run on a fourth-inning homer from Vanessa Leonhard but striking out seven to move up to eighth on Harvard’s career strikeout list.
Sophomore Ellen Macadam had two of the Crimson’s four hits in the game, with leadoff singles in the first and third innings. Harvard’s best chance came on a long fly ball off of Shaw’s bat, but the wind—which at times exceeded 20 mph—robbed the rookie of a homer.
“She got all of that ball,” Allard said. “If you hit it to the right side, it was going to go out, if you hit it to left field, nothing was going out.”
Schellberg and Vertovez had the other two hits for the Crimson, but the team was unable to move a runner past first base over the last four innings of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took Round 2 of yesterday’s bout to avenge last year’s heart-wrenching championship-game defeat. The Harvard softball team (19-9, 5-3 Ivy) dropped the first game of a doubleheader to reigning Ivy League champion Princeton (8-14, 3-5), 1-0, but the Crimson bats came alive in the second game, punishing the Tigers, 5-2. It was the second straight day that Harvard failed to score in the first game, only to be revived by freshman Whitney Shaw. As she did the day before, Shaw homered in the first inning of the second game to give the Crimson the lead. She outdid herself this time around, going deep again in the third to put the game out of reach. “I was just coming out, swinging hard,” Shaw said. “We wanted to pick ourselves up from the first game and just really prove to [Princeton] that we weren’t going to lay down and do what we did the first game.” HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 2 Left with a bitter taste after a disappointing loss, the Crimson came out looking to rebound against the Tigers. Sophomore Emily Henderson walked to set up Shaw with the opportunity to put Harvard up by a deuce. Shaw blasted the ball out of Soldiers Field and arrived at home plate, where the celebration began.  The show wasn’t over, as Shaw added another tally for the Crimson with a solo bomb to left field in the third inning, her third home run of the weekend and her fourth of the season. It was also in the third that co-captain Bailey Vertovez made an impressive diving catch while running with her back towards the ball, one of her many amazing catches of the day. The field provided great support for junior Dana Roberts, who pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings and earned her third win of the season.  “Whitney’s homer fired us up, and I think Bailey played an amazing shortstop today,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown said. “She made some huge plays and it was a great team effort.” The scoring wasn’t over, as Harvard put up two more runs in the fifth and sixth innings. Junior Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, started things up in the fifth with her single to third base. Sophomore Ellen Macadam followed with a single of her own, and Henderson’s single advanced Krysiak to third. Princeton pitcher Jamie Lettire grazed Shaw with a pitch, which allowed Krysiak to score.  The Tigers sought to play catch-up, getting two runs off of Brown in the top of the sixth. But the bottom of the frame saw Vertovez plate junior Jennifer Francis. Francis was the first batter up, and she singled and advanced to second, thanks to a bunt by junior Jessica Pledger, who is also a Crimson photographer. Vertovez stepped up to the plate and battled with Lettire before doubling off the center-field wall. Francis ran home to set the final mark. Brown sealed the deal in the top of the seventh, striking out two of the last three batters and earning her third save. PRINCETON 1, HARVARD 0 Despite an excellent outing by Brown, the Crimson couldn’t muster up more than one hit and failed to keep Princeton from scoring in a pivotal fifth inning. Brown started the game strong, striking out seven in the first four innings. Her counterpart, Tigers sophomore Michelle Tolfa, managed to strike out only one and walked five for the game.  It was the fifth inning that put Harvard behind for good. Lettire singled to Vertovez and an error by Krysiak allowed Princeton to put runners on first and third. The Tigers’ Brittney Scott bunted the ball and reached first base as Lettire ran for home and made co-captain and catcher Hayley Bock drop the ball to get the score. The Crimson couldn’t answer back, failing to get a hit the rest of the game. Brown struck out three more Tigers, ending the game with a total of 10 strikeouts. But the Crimson lacked the offensive spark needed to support Brown’s efforts.  “We didn’t come out with our bats the first game and we need to do that,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We talked about it before today’s game, coming out strong and being aggressive. We just didn’t execute the first game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday afternoon, many Boston-area students studied outdoors while sunbathing in near-60-degree paradise that perhaps suggested a change of heart in New England’s most fickle friend, the springtime weather.
Meanwhile, Harvard women’s golf was 40 minutes from campus at the Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, Mass., finishing up a strong performance at the 2009 Brown Invitational that was crafted in spite of poor overall weekend conditions. Of the many sports that are altered by wind and crippled by rain, golf is by nature one of the most vulnerable.
Nonetheless, the Crimson overcame a rainy Friday and dismal Saturday skies to finish first overall with 611 total strokes for the weekend, a commanding 35 strokes ahead of second place Boston College. 
Harvard senior Emily Balmert finished first place overall individually, with scores of 74 and 70 on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Freshman Christine Cho came in eight strokes behind her for second place overall. Junior Sarah Harvey and sophomore Mia Kabasakalis came in third and fourth, and the Crimson had every one of its players in the top 13. 
Home field advantage is non-existent in golf, as players from the Boston area prefer to travel south when the spring season starts. 
Wind conditions alone are enough to increase stroke numbers and averages at tournaments, as was the case this weekend. That said, Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads was pleased with this weekend’s turnout.
“Weather was certainly a factor this weekend,” Rhoads said. “When it’s the beginning of the season, especially for Northeast golf, any scores in that neighborhood [of 300 total per day] make me happy.”
Statistically, the tournament results were somewhat sporadic. After the Eagles, Dartmouth came in third, followed by Brown in fourth. Boston University was 116 strokes behind Harvard in fifth place. The average stroke gap between teams was above 20.
“Those schools do a great job—they played well,” said Rhoads. “As it was, I really wanted us to move forward with things that we were working on and we did that.”
Crimson golfers have done quite well this year, both in the fall and spring seasons. 
This past fall, Harvard finished first at the Dartmouth, Princeton, and Lehigh Invitationals as well as at the Yall Fall Intercollegiate. All but the Lehigh tournament featured over 15 teams.
While Rhoads was eager to give his players ample time to perfect specific aspects of their games, weather was once again a deterrent.
“With all the things that each player needs to work on—ball striking, short game, mental game, how to score—all those areas, when you have bad weather and bad conditions, those are a distraction from moving forward,” Rhodes said.
“It was our first tournament of the spring that was not in the warm California weather,” Balmert said. “In all of our cold weather gear, it’s a totally different type of golf, but we adapted well to the new surroundings.”
Balmert was the only player in the tournament to score under 75 on either day. Despite her favorable individual results, Balmert felt that she could have worked on her putting.
“I think I played well, but there’s always things that you do that you can improve upon,” she said.
Cho, too, was dissatisfied with her putting on Sunday, but feels confident in herself and her teammates moving forward.
“We just need to keep on practicing and sticking to our game,” Cho said.
While casually satisfied with this weekend, the Crimson is looking ahead to its two remaining events in the regular season, which are both in the next three weeks. Harvard travels to New York City for the RoarEE Invitational on April 18th. 
The following Friday, April 24th, the Crimson faces higher stakes at the Ivy League Championships in Northfield, New Jersey.
The Crimson must come in first at the Championships to automatically qualify for postseason play.
“A lot rides on whether we win Ivies,” said Rhoads. “A lot of our focus has been [there].”
Given the team’s results in the 2008-2009 year and its demonstrated ability to adapt to tough conditions, the rest of April is looking bright for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s taken a little while, but consider the Harvard baseball team comfortably settled on the broad shoulders of senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich. 
And as he settled into the batter’s box during the Crimson’s first weekend at O’Donnell Field, Stack-Babich was comfortable to the tune of a 9-for-19 pace, three homers, and eight RBI. 
Oh, and let’s not forget those walk-off hits on back-to-back days. 
Stack-Babich deposited an offering from Cornell’s David Rochefort over the center-field fence to give Harvard its second straight walk-off win over the Big Red, which had roared back from a four-run deficit to tie the game at five on a Nathan Ford jack in the top of the ninth. 
“Oh, it’s fun to see him up at the plate,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “I can only imagine if we didn’t have the wind, he might have had a couple.”
But the senior wasn’t done—after over 16 innings and over 500 pitches of baseball in Sunday’s marathon against Princeton, Stack-Babich decided he was ready to be done for the weekend. 
So with the bases full and the score tied at 12, his liner to center brought home sophomore Dillon O’Neill for the win. 
Lost momentarily in the celebration at home plate was the play that had pushed the game past the 13th frame. After the Tigers had brought home two runs off of Harvard sophomore Dan Berardo, and the Crimson had made the first two outs in the bottom half, captain Harry Douglas seemed to have a shot to pull Harvard within one before his fence-bound bomb was pulled foul. He settled for a single, leaving Stack-Babich to battle with the wind. 
Guess who won. 
Stack-Babich’s shot fought its way over the center-field wall to tie things up, setting the stage for more of the senior’s heroics in the 17th. 
“I just hoped he would give me something over the plate,” Stack-Babich said. “Too bad it wasn’t a three-run homer.”
“You see [Stack-Babich’s] swing, he’s not muscling, it’s just nice and quick,” Walsh added. 
It was not only the fierce wind, but also some pesky competition that kept a suddenly prolific Crimson offense from coasting this weekend. Sunday’s nightcap, in particular, was a never-say-die affair that showcased the best—and the worst—that Harvard’s roster has to offer. 
The worst: blowing an 8-0 lead after giving up four runs in the sixth and ninth innings. 
The best: some versatility, which featured Stack-Babich at both the plate and on the mound. 
After a rocky ninth inning that saw him surrender the game-tying run, the righty allowed just two hits over three innings of scoreless work.
He certainly didn’t do it all himself. Roommate Taylor Meehan won the first of the team’s four crucial Ivy games with a walk-off jack of his own Saturday, and that drama set the tone for a weekend of nail biting. 
Fellow senior Matt Rogers gave Stack-Babich a serious run for this award, turning in a six-homer week that included two weekend jacks and a monster grand slam in the Crimson’s 12-11 loss to Holy Cross last Wednesday. 
So it hasn’t been just Stack-Babich coming through during the team’s recent surge, but as he’s gone, so the team has tended to go. After struggling through the majority of Harvard’s 2-15 showing in non-conference play last month, Stack-Babich—and his team as a whole—is glad things have turned a corner. 
“I went through a pretty rough patch down south,” Stack-Babich said of his March struggles. “I think a lot of it was early and I didn’t have my stroke down.”
Stack-Babich and the Crimson made it three walk-off wins on the weekend, but three wins of any kind over Ivy competition were plenty for a team that managed just eight league victories in 2008. To date, the Crimson is 5-3 in Ancient Eight play.
“I felt a lot of pressure and it just wasn’t fun…then I relaxed and realized there’s no point in not having fun,” he continued. “So we’re just trying to relax and stay loose. It just feels good to have a little fun.”
The Crimson will play Northeastern in the opening round of the Beanpot Tournament today at 3 p.m. in Brockton, Mass. The winner will take on either Boston College or UMass next Monday at Fenway Park.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off Sunday’s 17-inning victory against Princeton, Harvard (7-18, 5-3 Ivy) begins its quest for its third Beanpot Championship today against Northeastern (14-10, 5-4 CAA). The contest, slated to begin at 3 p.m., will be played at Campanelli Stadium in Brockton, Mass. and will determine which of the teams play for the championship on Monday—against either Boston College or Massachusetts—at Fenway Park. If recent history between the two teams is any indication, this year’s game will be a close one. The opening-round game between the Huskies and the Crimson is a rematch from last year’s Beanpot consolation game, which Northeastern won, 7-6, in 10 innings. Last year, in the teams’ second meeting of the season, Harvard was on the other side of the 7-6 score. In that game—the Crimson’s last of the regular season—then-junior Matt Rogers propelled Harvard to victory with an eighth-inning home run. The win for the Crimson was its third consecutive one-run game against the Huskies.“Northeastern is always a tough team, and they always fight hard against us,” captain Harry Douglas said. “Year in and year out, they are a good team. We’re ready to face them.”Today’s contest marks the fourth time in the last five years that Harvard and Northeastern will face off in the annual tournament, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Harvard’s last championship came in 2005 at the expense of the Huskies, and in 2006, the Crimson beat Northeastern, 8-5, in opening-round play.Harvard hopes to keep its bats going tomorrow after a 60-hit weekend, six of which left the yard against Cornell and Princeton.“[We] will take a good approach at the plate, look to drive the ball, look for good pitches to hit, and take advantage of hitters’ counts,” Douglas said.In last year’s Beanpot game against the Huskies, Rogers, Douglas, then-junior Taylor Meehan, and then-freshmen Sean O’Hara and Dillon O’Neill all had multi-hit games.The big concern for Harvard, however, is the availability of its pitchers.“Coming off a four-game weekend, including one that went 17 innings, it puts an awful lot of pressure on our pitching staff,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “We’re going to rely on people we don’t usually rely on,” Douglas added. “I think we’ll use a lot of our younger pitchers. It will be more of a staff effort.”To further complicate matters, some of the Harvard players might be unable to make the afternoon trip because of conflicts with classes and midterms.“We’re scrambling,” Walsh said. “They are true student-athletes.”Walsh will start either sophomore Anthony Nutter or sophomore Zach Hofeld, neither of whom has seen significant action in the rotation this season.“Hofeld has really found his fastball,” Walsh said, expressing confidence in the sophomore. “If he gets his curve going—that’s his out pitch.”Of concern to the Crimson is also its game tomorrow against Bryant in Rhode Island. “Two games midweek can really put a toll on our staff,” Walsh said. “But we’re going to have to muddle our way through.”The Huskies, like Harvard, are no stranger to extra-inning games. A quarter of Northeastern’s games this season—including three of the past five—have advanced into extra frames.At the plate, the Huskies are led by senior Mike Tamsin. The left-handed hitting third baseman leads the squad with a .375 batting average. Tamsin—who also leads the team in hits (36), RBI (18), total bases (53), slugging percentage (.552) and on-base percentage (.487)—became Northeastern’s all-time hits leader on March 28 in a game against Hofstra.“[Tamsin] puts the ball in the seats,” Walsh said. “He is one of the best hitters in New England. We are going to pitch him very carefully—he’s the guy that scares me.”With strong hitting and a tradition of close contests, the Beanpot opening round is sure to be a slugfest worthy of the tournament’s 20-year history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another weekend of competition meant another three regattas for the Harvard sailing team, as both the co-ed and women’s squads stretched themselves over the waters of New England this past weekend. While the much-anticipated home opener of a certain professional Boston area sports team had to be postponed due to inclement weather yesterday, the contingent from Cambridge competed admirably over the weekend amidst fierce winds and challenging waters. Despite some less-than-stellar team results, the Crimson took advantage of the tough conditions to tinker with its lineups and display some of its depth in the Dellenbaugh Trophy Women’s Intersectional in Providence, R.I., the Southern New England Team Race in New London, Conn., and the Central Series Three regatta in Medford, Mass.“Our first really windy regattas of the year necessitated that we try some new combinations,” senior Megan Watson said. “It was windy the entire weekend, which made it difficult on our crews, and they are probably pretty worn out after two days of competition, but they deserve a lot of credit.”DELLENBAUGH TROPHY WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONALCloudy and windy weather welcomed Harvard’s women’s squad to the Dellenbaugh Trophy Women’s Intersectional, where the Crimson took home seventh in a field of 16 teams.Harvard placed fifth in the A division, led by the return of junior Liz Powers, who was a workhorse over the weekend. Powers skippered the first eight races in the division, teaming up with freshman crew Alexandra Jumper for the first two contests and freshman crew Lilla Cosgrove for the other six races. Then, for the final six races in the division, Powers crewed, while Watson skippered, leaving the Crimson a mere five points out of fourth place in the division. Each skipper had one victory and one runner-up finish on the weekend.“Powers was a super woman this weekend,” Watson said. “She was injured all fall, and we are excited to have her back. She skippered well and hiked hard as crew, and it is great to have her back competing.”In the B division, freshman skipper Emily Lambert switched from her normal crew, as Cosgrove crewed the first two races, freshman crew Marie Appel the next four, and Jumper the final eight. Harvard finished ninth overall in this division, 13 points out of sixth place.Yale won the overall team title, totaling 119 points over the two-day affair.SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TEAM RACEMost of the regulars from Harvard’s co-ed squad finished ninth out of 18 teams at the Southern New England Team Race. Despite the rather mediocre finish, the Crimson’s weekend began well, with a 6-2 record on Saturday in the first round robin of the regatta. Harvard found itself tied with its counterparts from Boston College with the best record in their group after Day 1.This Saturday success placed the Crimson into Sunday’s top fleet, where the team struggled to a 2-7 record on the day, which was marked by very windy conditions. The Eagles took home the team victory on the weekend, bettering their solid Saturday record with an even better 8-1 record on Day 2.CENTRAL SERIES THREEHarvard’s efforts at the Central Series Three competition over the weekend were highlighted by the performances of two rookies, as freshman skipper Brendan Kopp and freshman crew Annie DeAngelo won the A division to lead the Crimson to a fourth-place team finish amongst the field of 19.The rookie duo was remarkably consistent over the windy two days of competition, as the freshmen finished no worse than fourth in all 10 races, winning their final race and taking second place four times and third place twice.“They had to deal with some really tricky conditions this weekend,” sophomore captain Alan Palmer said. “Some teams suffered from broken boats, it was so windy. It was great for Brendan to get some experience in these challenging conditions.”In the B division, sophomore skipper Colin Santangelo teamed up with freshman crew William White to place 10th. The Terriers from Boston University won the overall team title.—Staff writer Thomas D. Hutchison can be reached at tdhutch@fas.harvard.edu.

Ahhhh…. Opening Day at Fenway Park.  Warm sunshine, the smell of freshly cut grass, that first delicious bite of a Fenway Frank, the crack of the bat as Big Papi puts one over the Green Monster.  Oh wait, just kidding.  It’s actually raining, hovering around 44 degrees, and Opening Day was just cancelled.  Thank you New England weather.
Guess that makes J.P. Licks’s $1 scoop day in honor of Opening Day a little anticlimactic.  According to their Web site, J.P. Licks will be serving $1 scoops of ice cream and frozen yogurt today at all their locations from noon-9pm.  If flavors like “rice DICE Kream” and “Pedroia’s Passion Fruit” aren’t enough to get you in the door, then maybe “the most fun pie ever” will.

HUTV has been making some changes this year.  As if switching their name from Harvard Radcliffe Television to Harvard Undergraduate Television wasn’t revolutionary enough, HUTV has just launched its new Web site.  To drum up excitement over the launch, members of HUTV tabled outside of the Science Center today and accosted passer-bys with the usual Science Center publicity mélange of flyers, candy, and blaring Britney tunes.  Details of their exploits, pre-horrific rainstorm, after the jump.
Alisha P. D. Ramos ’12, HUTV’s Vice President of Publicity and Marketing, describes the new Web site as being “very Web 2.0.”  Luis A. Martinez ’12, Vice President of Events and Management, had a different take on the new Web site.  “It’ sexy,” he says.  “There is no other word to describe it.”  Mmmm, indeed.  If a sleek new site design doesn’t get you aroused, then there must be something wrong with your libido.
The Web site features links to regular programs like “Ivory Tower” and “On Harvard Time” as well to gems like “Men for Palin” and Petros’s music videos.  (You mean I can watch “Body Glow” and "Predator” on repeat?!)
If none of the available programming tickles your fancy, then try entering HUTV’s video contest and get your own video posted to the site.  The challenge is to make a video of 90 seconds or less answering the question “What’s Harvard Really Like?” Oh, the possibilities…
If for nothing else, at least check out the site to watch Steven Pinker go absolutely crazy.  There are few things in life that are simultaneously more terrifying and more entertaining than watching this man's luscious locks fly about as he takes a bat to an old television set.

Like brother, like sister. Actor and producer James Haven might be better known as the equally pale brother of Angelina Jolie, that luminescent beauty of an actress who has garnered for herself a different type of celebrity status as an international do-gooder. Haven wants to follow suit, and his work will take him to Harvard this week.
And siblings love each other, you know? So the whole family is coming. Yes, that's right: Brangelina (and James Haven) are coming to Harvard on Wednesday (more after the jump).
International Relations on Campus (IRoC) has been working with the Global Health and Aids Coalition to invite Haven on campus to speak for their Global Health Day, on Wednesday, April 6th.  According to Alyssa T. Yamamoto '12, an assistant director of IRoC, Harvard Medical School professor Jim Yong Kim had recently met with Haven's PR person, and the actor expressed his interest in creating "some sort of bond between celebrities and academia."
FlyBy has confirmed that Haven will be speaking to a panel on "Socially Responsible Careers in a Global Age," but of slightly more interest, Pitt and Jolie (and the children, perhaps?) are expected to be there as well. Organizers of the event thought that they might as well try to have Brangelina speak in a panel event if they were going to show up, but the discussion has reached a stalemate with the people in PR, Yamamoto said.
FlyBy will send more details as they come.

What better way to spend an entire weekend than to lead an awe-struck 18-year-old around campus? Oh, yes, fellow Harvardians. The time has come once again for the army of new admits to infiltrate our daily lives! Excited?! Flyby is, too.
Oh, wait. You didn’t realize your other suitemates also signed up for their own prefrosh, too? And your futon’s only got room for one? Hope you don’t mind sharing your bed with a complete stranger. (More potential prefrosh woes after the jump.)
And what are you going to do when you realize that you can’t possibly sneak your parliamentary debate champ from Argyle, Texas into the Delphic but that really hot guy you met last week is going to be inside? Leave her by J. Press to fend for herself? Cold.
Flyby took the liberty of calling up a few potential members of the Class of 2013 who will be attending Prefrosh Weekend.
Chenglin Yuan, who lives in the Boston area, said that she looks most forward to meeting her potential classmates, many of whom she has already met at a preview event held by the Harvard Club of Boston. “Everyone was surprisingly really normal…” she said. “But they were extraordinary people, too!” she quickly added. 
Spoken like a true Harvard student. 
Others are excited about touring campus and beyond. “Honestly, I’m sort of nervous about coming to meet everyone,” admitted Georgia native Meilakh Barshay. “I most definitely want to see a lot of the campus and explore Boston and the city.”
Awwww. Turns out they are kinda cute. Almost makes Flyby wish we had a prefrosh of our own. Almost.

Here's to hoping you brought your best oxen today.
This fine puddle sat in the Mem Hall, Mem Church and Thayer intersection for quite some time today.  In FlyBy's 15 or so minutes observing the monstrosity, no one dared attempt to test its depth by crossing, even those in their best rain boots.  The cause of such a huge lake?  Clogged drains, below, of course.  A quick clearing by FMO workers led to the pond's untimely death.  No dead bodies were recovered upon draining.
