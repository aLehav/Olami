After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two  people stood on stage, a man and a woman. They started dancing, and it  was violent, disorienting, and uncomfortable with rough shoves to the  chest, each smack enunciated with staccato. When their limbs intertwined  they became one individual, symbiotic and unhealthy in their  dependence. There was a distinct feeling that they would collapse  without each other. When it was done, the woman came up to the man, and  with total resolution and a steely look in her eyes said, “Do it again.”
Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Sea Change,” which played until May 4 at the Loeb Mainstage, was for the most part thought-provoking and innovative, merging different mediums of art to create a rich, textured product. Written and directed by Daniel J. Giles ’13, the show told the story of Mary Shelley and her ill-fated love for her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. The creation of “Frankenstein,” Mary Shelley’s literary claim to fame, served as the the thread that linked the plot together, creating a  heartbreaking, fractured fairy tale as the pair struggled to navigate  their marriage and the resulting emotional deterioration.
Giles’s  poignant script and explores how a story can be uniquely shaped by the  teller. There are only two characters in the play, but each was  portrayed by two actors: Mary  (Emily B. Hyman ’13) represents the “real” Mary Shelley, while M  (Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13) represents the fictional version of her, the idealization of “Frankenstein”’s creator. The same distillation was  seen with Mary’s husband, again played by two actors, each representing  a different stage of his life: S (Bryan D. Kauder ’13) and Shelly (John L. Pizzato ’16).  
“Death  is having a way with people you never had” says M to Mary. When Shelley  dies, Mary tries to recreate an idealized version of her life with him.  The interplay between fantasy and reality is tricky, and for the most  part Giles was able to play eloquently with the idea by breaking and  recreating the metaphorical wall between the two dimensions. While the  soliloquies and dialogue could have benefitted from some editing, the  script’s core theme was always at the forefront of the production. 
The set design by Zena M. S. Mengesha ’14 added to this juxtaposition. The first half of the play took place in a  white box surrounded by a curtain. The stage presented a distinct  feeling of isolation as it tried to emulate Mary’s imagination. It was a  brilliant move from Mengesha and Giles to expand the action to take up  the entire stage in the second half when the narrator switched from Mary  to M, mirroring the shift from a fictionalized story to facts. There  were hints of “Frankenstein’s” fantastical, almost science fiction tone:  oversized Frankenstein feet were placed to the side and circles that  looked like planets and orbits hung from the ceiling.
Giles  used puppets to reenact the plot line of “Frankenstein,” integrating  the well-known story with the tensions in Mary and Shelley’s marriage.  In these emotional moments, heightened by the original music composed by Samuel G. Ruchman '15, the actors and puppets alternated between movement and stillness. The  final scene of deterioration between the couple ended with the  puppeteers leaving their puppets hunched over each over with their  strings loose. As the story between man and monster came to an end, so  did Mary and Shelley’s relationship. 
Fraught  with small interludes of dance, the dance and movement in the  production helped to express emotion not innately obvious through  dialogue. At times it seemed out of place and unnecessary. One such  example came after the death of Wilhelm, Mary’s child. His procession to  heaven was symbolized as a puppeteer (Sean K. Hardy '16) performed an acrobatic dance with aerial silks. Too long and indulgent,  the intrusion of a circus act into the narration didn’t quite work. 
Other  times, though, movement and dance were used to spectacular results. One  of the centerpieces in the first half of the play was a reenactment of  the “Frankenstein” plot through a physical, enlarged storyboard.  Perfectly in sync with the music, the puppeteers moved fluidly as they  put together pieces of the storyline with Velcro pictures. The final  result accurately recreates the inner working of Mary’s mind as she  concocts her masterpiece. 
At  the end of the production, S speaks to Shelley, demanding his  counterpart to decide what type of man he will be. “It’s time to decide  who you are—maker or monster,” he says. With such an emotional ending,  Giles’s “Sea Change” invited its audience to live and breath the life of  Mary Shelley, leaving a sentiment that resonated even after the  curtains were closed.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 13, 2013
An earlier version of this article included a statement and a headline that misquoted a line spoken by the character S in Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Sea Change.” In fact, S told the Percy Bysshe Shelley character that he must decide whether he was a “maker or monster,” not a “master or monster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week I said something stupid about John Maynard Keynes.  Asked to comment on Keynes’ famous observation “In the long run we are all dead,” I suggested that Keynes was perhaps indifferent to the long run because he had no children, and that he had no children because he was gay. This was doubly stupid. First, it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future generations. Second, I had forgotten that Keynes’ wife Lydia miscarried.
I was duly attacked for my remarks and offered an immediate and unqualified apology. But this did not suffice for some critics, who insisted that I was guilty not just of stupidity but also of homophobia. I have no doubt that at least some students were influenced by these allegations. Nobody would want to study with a bigot. I therefore owe it to students—former and prospective—to make it unambiguously clear that I am no such thing.
To be accused of prejudice is one of the occupational hazards of public life nowadays. There are a remarkable number of people who appear to make a living from pouncing on any utterance that can be construed as evidence of bigotry. Only last year, though not for the first time, I found myself being accused of racism for venturing to criticize President Obama. This came as a surprise to my wife, who was born in Somalia.
The charge of homophobia is equally easy to refute. If I really were a “gay-basher”, as some headline writers so crassly suggested, why would I have asked Andrew Sullivan, of all people, to be the godfather of one of my sons, or to give one of the readings at my wedding?
Throughout my career as a historian, I have regularly written and spoken about Keynes, who had one of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century. That, of course, is the most important thing about him. You may disagree with his argument that, in a depressed economy, the government should borrow and spend money to stimulate aggregate demand. But you cannot ignore it.
Not for one moment did I mean to suggest that Keynesian economics as a body of thought was simply a function of Keynes’ sexuality. But nor can it be true—as some of my critics apparently believe—that his sexuality is totally irrelevant to our historical understanding of the man. My very first book dealt with the German hyperinflation of 1923, a historical calamity in which Keynes played a minor but important role. In that particular context, Keynes’ sexual orientation did have historical significance. The strong attraction he felt for the German banker Carl Melchior undoubtedly played a part in shaping Keynes’ views on the Treaty of Versailles and its aftermath.
The historian, unlike the economist, is concerned with biography as well as with statistics. Keynes’ first biographer, Roy Harrod, drew a veil over Keynes’ complex private life. But the author of the more recent and definitive three-volume life, Robert Skidelsky, felt no such inhibition. Anyone who reads that great work will find the question of Keynes’ homosexuality treated sensitively and intelligently and related, where appropriate, to his work. Keynes’ fellow members of the Bloomsbury Group would have approved, had they lived to read Skidelsky’s book, for they had no doubt at all that sexual orientation had a significance beyond the narrow confines of the bedroom, and that intellectual life and emotional life were intertwined.
As a historian, I have often had to contend with the question of how far to take the Bloomsbury approach.  Keynes is very far from the only homosexual or bisexual I have written about. In The Pity of War, for example, I discussed the case of T.E. Lawrence, whose real or imagined rape by his Turkish captors was central to his experience of World War I. In The House of Rothschild, I identified at least three members of that illustrious financial dynasty as gay. In Empire, I sketched the lives of both repressed and unrepressed homosexuals who played important roles in the Victorian British Empire.
Yet no one who reads these books could seriously accuse me of harboring a prejudice against gay men (or women). It would be as absurd to accuse me of anti-Semitism for alluding to the fact that the Rothschilds or Warburgs were Jews.
In The War of the World, I sought to explain how warped, pseudo-scientific racial and “eugenic” theories provided a justification for some of the most horrific acts of organized violence in all human history. I could not have been more explicit in condemning such theories. You will find a similar condemnation in Civilization: The West and the Rest. Incidentally, one of the heroes of that book is Frederick the Great of Prussia, who was almost certainly gay.
There is still, regrettably, a great deal of prejudice in the world, racial as well as sexual. There are two strategies we may adopt. One is repression—the old Victorian practice of simply not talking about such things. The other is education. In my writing and teaching, I have labored long and hard to expose precisely what was wrong about the theories that condemned homosexuals, Jews and others to discrimination and death. I have also tried to explain what made those theories so lethally appealing.
The War of the World concludes: “We shall avoid another century of conflict only if we understand the forces that caused the last one—the dark forces that conjure up ethnic conflict and imperial rivalry out of economic crisis, and in doing so negate our common humanity.”
I doubt very much that any of my vituperative online critics have made a comparable effort to understand the nature and dire consequences of prejudice. For the self-appointed inquisitors of internet, it is always easier to accuse than seriously to inquire.
In the long run we are all indeed dead, at least as individuals. Perhaps Keynes was lucky to pre-decease the bloggers because, for all his brilliance, was also prone to moments of what we would now call political incorrectness. In his Economic Consequences of the Peace, for example, he wrote: “Unless her great neighbours are prosperous and orderly, Poland is an economic impossibility with no industry but Jew-baiting.” Even at the time, that was an outrageous thing to say about a country that had suffered grave hardships since its partition in the eighteenth century. But does anyone today seriously argue that we should not read Keynes because he was a Polonophobe?
Ironically, Keynes was even more averse to Americans than to Poles. As he told a friend in 1941: “I always regard a visit [to the US] as in the nature of a serious illness to be followed by convalescence.” To his eyes, Washington was dominated by lawyers, all speaking incomprehensible legalese—or, as Keynes put it, “Cherokee”.
Shock, horror: Even the mighty Keynes occasionally said stupid things. Most professors do. And—let's face it—so do most students.
What the self-appointed speech police of the blogosphere forget is that to err occasionally is an integral part of the learning process. And one of the things I learnt from my stupidity last week is that those who seek to demonize error, rather than forgive it, are among the most insidious enemies of academic freedom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning journalist Soledad M. O’Brien ’88-’00 will be this year’s Class Day speaker, the Senior Class Committee announced Tuesday night.
O’Brien, a former CNN anchor and Cabot House resident, will deliver remarks to the Class of 2013 in Tercentenary Theatre on May 29, the day before Commencement. She will headline the Class Day ceremony, which will also feature Harvard and Ivy orations delivered by four graduating seniors.
First Class Marshal Nina M. Yancy ’13 said she was thrilled by O’Brien’s selection.
“We had the chance to speak over the weekend with Soledad and get to know her a bit, and she was just so fantastic,” Yancy said.
O’Brien has strong ties to the University. After coming to Harvard as an undergraduate, she took time off during her senior year in 1988 before returning to school in 2000 to complete her degree. In the upcoming school year, O’Brien will be a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.
“It’s awesome that she’s so personally connected to the Harvard community,” Second Class Marshall Scott Yim ’13 said. “We think that she’s going to give a message that will resonate with the rest of our class.”
Yancy and Yim said that O’Brien told them she never had the chance to experience Class Day for herself—and that as a result, this Class Day would be her own.
O’Brien, a former correspondent for CNN and NBC, is also known for her documentary “Black in America,” which was met with wide critical acclaim. She is currently producing documentaries through Starfish Media, her own production company.
Harvard Law School has also recently announced its Class Day speaker—senior CNN legal analyst, New Yorker writer, and Supreme Court expert Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82.
Toobin, a former Crimson sports and editorial editor who graduated from Harvard Law in 1986, also served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. He is perhaps best known for his best-selling book “The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court.”
Last year, Harvard took the unusual step of selecting two College Class Day speakers in recognition of the University’s 375th anniversary. U.S. Rep. Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62 and comedian Andy Samberg addressed the Class of 2012 in those Class Day festivities. U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. delivered remarks at the Law School’s Class Day last year.
