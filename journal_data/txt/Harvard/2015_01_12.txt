After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off its winter training trip to Puerto Rico, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team resumed its meet schedule in a nonconference contest against southern rivals Duke and South Carolina on Saturday.
The Crimson (4-1, 3-0 Ivy) narrowly beat the Gamecocks (5-4, 0-1 SEC), 154-146. But the Blue Devils (7-1, 1-1 ACC) handed Harvard its first loss of the season, winning 154-146.
Before the meet started, several factors made this contest different from the others that the Crimson has on its schedule.
The Harvard team had been traveling for the three days before the meet, and the squad arrived at the pool less than an hour after landing in North Carolina due to delays.
In addition, Saturday's meet was the first one since all three teams finished their winter training camps, during which teams typically undergo their most difficult training. With every team in top physical shape for 2015, the success came down to the little things.
“Not just the work but all the other intangibles came into effect,” said Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92. “We knew everyone was tired, so it came down to who mentally had it, who was tougher.”
The Crimson was also facing its first nonconference meet against two teams with winning records. Both Duke and South Carolina came into the meet with a full schedule of conference, nonconference, and invitational meets under their belts, meaning Harvard began the meet with the least experience on the season.
With big meets against Yale and Princeton as well as the Ivy Championships coming up, this meet provided an opportunity for Harvard to practice competitive swimming without the pressure of the conference standings.
“It really played a big role in helping us practice for the final meets,” co-captain Stephanie Ferrell said. “It gives us practice for if [the Ivy meets] come down to the wire. We’ll know how to perform under pressure and stay mentally tough.”
This meet did come down to the wire, with all three teams’ records determined by the last race: the 400 freestyle relay. The Crimson needed to beat the Gamecocks to win the meet against South Carolina, and it needed both first and second place to beat the Blue Devils.
As the swimmers completed their last lap, Harvard sophomore Danielle Lee touched the wall first, followed shortly by the Duke A team. Sophomores Victoria Chan and Daniela Johnson and junior Kendall Crawford joined Lee on the winning relay team.
“Every opportunity you have to race somebody who’s faster pushes you to the very end,” Morawski said. “It shows who individually can step up, who can take it to the next level, who can handle the pressure. And as a team, it shows them what they’re capable of.”
In the 100 free, Chan beat out Duke’s Leah Goldman by 0.1 seconds to secure another podium-topping finish. Chan also took second in the 50 free and fourth in the 200 free.
Lee, who was Harvard’s only competitor in the NCAA championships last year, swam alongside Ferrell and Crawford in the 200 medley relay, and notched a third-place finish in the 200 free. Lee also earned the gold in the 200 backstroke, finishing alongside freshman teammate Kristina Li, who placed third in the event.
Ferrell herself took the Crimson’s first gold in the 100 breaststroke. She notched another first place finish in the 200 breast and placed third in the 200 individual medley behind freshman teammate Geordie Enoch.
“[Mental toughness] is the most important thing in competition,” Ferrell said. “You can make your body do whatever you want it to do if you’re mentally tough enough.”
On the boards, the Gamecocks proved dominant, sweeping the 3-meter event. The Harvard divers’ sole podium finish came from freshman Hannah Allchurch, whose performance of 291.30 prevented another South Carolina sweep in the 1-meter.
Sophomore Elina Leiviska had the Crimson’s top finish in the three-meter, finishing sixth.
Even with a win, Morawski says that the scores were not the most important part of the meet.
“What we took out of this meet was more than just one win,” Morawski said. “We took away a lot about how we can look to each other, we can be flexible under any circumstance, [and we] can be resilient, fight to the very end, and not give up under pressure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team has started 2015 the same way it ended 2014. With a win.
With victories on Saturday against Duke and South Carolina, the Crimson (5-0, 3-0 Ivy) extended its dual meet win streak to three this season and seven including the end of last season. Harvard defeated the Blue Devils by a score of 199-95, and the Gamecocks by a score of 180-120.
"I thought yesterday was incredible. All of the guys were really tired, and we had a tough week and a half of training," co-captain Michael Gaudiani said. "We came back and finished strong against two hard teams.”
The meet was the team’s first since it returned from a training trip in St. Croix to kick off the 2015 portion of the season. Prior to Saturday, Harvard hadn’t competed since December 4th when it swam at the Texas and UGA Invitationals.  Despite the lack of official competition, the Crimson’s performances wouldn’t suggest that it had taken any breaks.
“We’re constantly mimicking the race involvement in practice, so even though we haven’t had an official competition, we’re used to going fast in practice,” co-captain Griffin Schumacher said. Harvard, which is ranked No. 19 by the CSCAA, topped the podium on eight occasions during the meet.  Schumacher claimed two of those first place finishes in both the 50 and the 100 freestyle. Both of these races were hotly contested by Schumacher’s own teammates, with the winner decided by fractions of a second.  In the 50 free, Schumacher finished with a time of 20.39 seconds. Sophomore Paul O’Hara finished a half second behind his teammate with a time of 20.90 seconds, with freshman Ed Kim in fifth with a time of 21.06 seconds. Senior Spenser Goodman was on Schumacher’s tail in the 100 free, as he touched the wall 0.32 seconds behind Schumacher’s time of 45.28 seconds.  “It’s really fun because we are going after it every day in practice and we are always right next to each other,” Schumacher said. “You know when you set up on the blocks, and you’re right next to your teammate, you have that confidence, and you look over and you see the same guy you see everyday in training. It kind of just allows you to take a deep breath and know this performance is something you’ve been practicing the entire year.” Sophomore Jack Manchester also had multiple wins on the day, taking the 100 and 200 backstroke events. The Crimson swept the 200 back, with freshman Koya Osada and junior Christian Yeager rounding out the top spots. On the board, senior Michael Mosca continued his domination of the three-meter event as he topped the podium with a score of 369.45. He was unable to sweep the diving events, however, falling to third in the one-meter, just ahead of freshman teammates Bobby Pfeiffer and Bobby Ross.
The tri-meet was Harvard’s last nonconference meet before NCAAs, as the team returns to Ivy League competition on January 17th against Brown and Penn. Despite the fact that the victories against Duke and South Carolina do not count towards Harvard’s fight to hold their title as Ivy League Champion, the meet holds value in that it takes the Crimson out of its comfort zone in the Ivy League with new competition.  “It’s kind of easy to fall into a rhythm swimming against the same guys for four years against other Ivy League teams,” Schumacher said. “Its good to face new competitors whether it be from the ACC or just other teams across the countries so we can use the experience from this weekend and translate it into more success in the Ivy League.”—Staff writer Theresa Hebert can be reached at thebert@college.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, the Harvard women’s squash team did something it had not done in almost a year—lose a match. This weekend, the top-ranked Crimson squad split its road contests with two top-five opponents, defeating No. 5 Princeton, 7-2, on Saturday before falling to No. 3 Penn, 5-4, on Sunday.
The loss to the Quakers was the team’s first defeat since it fell to Trinity last February, and its first Ivy League loss since losing to the Tigers in January of 2013. The two matches were the first road contests of the season for Harvard (3-1, 2-1 Ivy) and the first overall in over a month for the squad.
While the Penn match proved tough for the Crimson, Harvard coach David Way was quick to credit the Quakers.
“We knew it was going to be a tough match, and it was one of the best and most exciting matches I’ve been at,” Way said. “The Penn girls got the job done. It was very, very close.”
Senior Amanda Sobhy, junior Saumya Karki, and sophomore Dileas MacGowan picked up victories on both days for Harvard. Also picking up key wins for the Crimson was freshman Sue Ann Yong, playing in the two biggest matches of her young Harvard career. While playing from the sixth position, the Malaysia native won both of her matches in three games.
PENN 5, HARVARD 4
On Sunday, the host Quakers (7-0, 2-0) proved to be too much for the Crimson. Playing in front of a large home crowd, Penn won matches in the second through fifth positions as well as in the ninth. The Quakers had won all 54 of their individual regular season games entering Sunday. Harvard ended that streak, but it still fell to Penn for just the first time since the 2007-2008 season.
“[Penn] fought really hard, and we were expecting a tough match,” co-captain Megan Murray said. “I think it definitely gives us a little fire to push ourselves when we meet them again at nationals, hopefully. We’ll hopefully turn that result around next time.”
Three of the five Crimson losses came in five-game matches. Sobhy, the three-time defending individual national champion, led the way for Harvard, defeating Penn sophomore Anaka Alankamony in three games. Co-captains Haley Mendez and Murray and freshman Alyssa Mehta each fell to Quakers.
The Crimson went into the final two matches holding a 4-3 lead after victories by Karki, Yong, and MacGowan. However, both sophomore Katie Tutrone and junior Michelle Gemmell fell in back-and-forth five-game matches.
“Something that we’re really proud of from Saturday was that everyone made adjustments mid-match and really turned it around,” Murray said. “A lot of people did make those adjustments going into the next day, and unfortunately, we just didn’t get the result we wanted.”
HARVARD 7, PRINCETON 2
On Saturday, Harvard was led by Sobhy in its win over the Tigers (4-1, 0-1). The Sea Cliff, N.Y. native swept Princeton freshman Olivia Fiechter in the day’s top match. The Crimson also picked up victories in the fourth through ninth position matches as each Harvard player was able to defeat her opponent in either three or four games.
The Crimson’s only losses against the Tigers came in the second and third positions as Mendez fell to Princeton sophomore Maria Elena Ubina in three games while sophomore Katherine Tutrone lost at the hands of Tiger senior Nicole Bunyan in the only five-game match of the day.
Mehta and Karki picked up four-game victories for Harvard from the fourth and seventh positions, respectively. Gemmell, Yong, MacGowan, and senior Julianne Chu won their matches in three games for the Crimson.
“[Saturday] was a good first match of 2015 to get a nerve out,” Mendez said. “Our freshmen did great. It’s always tough playing Princeton at home so I think we did well to show up, stay in our bubble, act very professionally, and get the job done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to kick off 2015 with success, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams sent members to Hanover, N.H. to compete at the 46th Dartmouth Relays.
The small squads demonstrated individual and team success, as both teams placed fourth, with the men gaining three individual victories, while the women placed four entries among the top three for their respective events.
The Crimson athletes were led by the field competitors, as defending Ivy League Champions sophomore Nikki Okwelogu and captain Ben Glauser shined in their respective events to lead their squads.
Okwelogu continued her success by breaking her own indoor school record in the shot put with a time of 15.33 meters—0.2 meters better than the previous mark. The sophomore would place second overall and first among all collegiate entries in the event.
Okwelogu’s performance gained the praise of teammates, as she continues to build on her success form the previous season.
“Nikki is one of the most exciting people to watch that I’ve ever competed with.” Glauser said. “She’s a phenomenal competitor.”
Her fellow field teammates would follow up this success as senior Ann Giebelhaus and sophomore Raegan Nizdil finished second and third in the high jump with marks of 1.69 and 1.64 meters respectively. Senior Taylor Dupont would round out the four top-three finishes with a 15.19 meter third-place finish in the weight throw.
The men, not to be outdone, were also successful, as Glauser led the team with an impressive victory in the weight throw.
Glauser, the defending Ancient Eight champion in the hammer throw, would take the weight throw title home with a mark of 18.22 meters, almost a whole meter better than the second place finish of 17.25 meters.
The senior’s success didn’t stop there, as he also placed fourth in the shot put with a 16.17 meter throw. But Glauser believes that despite the decisive victory, there is still room for improvement as the season progresses.
“I think there was some technical issues, and volume is very high in our training, so I think it will be much better next week when we come home and [throughout] the rest of the season.” Glauser said. “I was happy to come away with the win today.”
Harvard’s success was not limited to the field however, as the freshmen men demonstrated their strength in the track events as well.
Rookie Malcom Johnson would take home two titles, placing first in the 60-meter dash with a time of 6.85 seconds while also running the lead leg of the first place 4-x-200 meter relay.
Johnson was joined by classmates Matthew Hurst, Alexander Moore and Andrew Bolze, as the freshmen combined to run a time of 1:28.23 to take home the gold. Fellow rookie Jay Herbert would continue the first-years' success with a fifth place finish in the 60-meter hurdles with an 8.39 seconds finish.
The strong performance by the freshman displayed the potential and talent which they bring to the team.
“They’ve shown those flashes of what their potential is,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I think the key will be, consistently, how well they can work day in and day out in practice.”
The meet also gave the Crimson a chance to get an early look at host and Ivy rival Dartmouth. The Big Green is a perennial powerhouse for track and field and one of Harvard’s strongest competitors.
While there is still a large portion of the indoor season left to go before the teams meet at the Hepagonal Championships, Saretsky believes that the Crimson have what it takes to compete against traditional powers.
“[On the women’s side] there is some great competition within the league,” Saretsky said. “Within the league, we have a target on our back, and a lot of teams are gunning for us. On the men’s side, with the work that we’ve added and the guys we have here, we feel they are ready to join the women competing for a championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a new year comes a new streak for the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team (3-2, 3-0 Ivy). The reigning national champion opened the 2015 season with a road trip to No. 9 Princeton (3-4, 1-1) and No. 11 Penn (5-2, 1-1) over the weekend.
In the Ivy League double header, the Crimson defeated Princeton on Saturday and Penn on Sunday by identical 7-2 scores.
“We were definitely a little bit nervous,” sophomore Devin McLaughlin said. “Obviously Penn and Princeton are always very good teams year in and year out, but coming off the break, everyone came out and trained really hard. We had two tough losses…and we just wanted to rally ourselves, and play a lot better, more focused and as a team.”
HARVARD 7, PENN 2
The Crimson traveled to Ringe Courts in Philadelphia, PA. on Sunday to catch its third win of the season against the Quakers.
Harvard rookies Madhav Dhingra and Bradley Smith had the longest matches of the afternoon, both lasting five sets each.
Dhingra initially led 2-1, but was unable to best Penn's Marwan Mahmoud, who rallied in the last two sets. Smith kept his winning streak alive after pulling through in a long match against Hayes Murphy of the Quakers.
“I think they were the closest matches of the weekend so far with two 3-2s.” Smith said. “It gets pretty tense. In the sixth game it depends, it could maybe go either way if it gets really close, so it gets pretty tense, pretty interesting at that point.”
Another freshman, Seif Eleinen, made his debut this weekend for the Crimson at the No. 9 spot. He kicked off his career with a sweep, taking out Penn’s George Lemmon in three sets.
Co-captain Tyler Olson earned his third sweep of the season against Tyler Odell, remaining undefeated on the year with five wins.
Sophomore Dylan Murray, freshman David Ryan, and junior Matt Roberts also contributed wins—Murray and Roberts with sweeps—to solidify Harvard’s win.
“We definitely played a lot more together as a team these two matches than we did earlier in the season.” McLaughlin said. “I think we have to keep the motivation up, keep our fitness levels high, just keep training, and stay focused.”
HARVARD 7, PRINCETON 2
The Crimson's two-match losing streak ended in Jadwin Gym in Princeton, N.J., as it recorded a second straight win against the Tigers and its first win of the new year.
“Every match we approach the same way,” Smith said. “You can’t take anything for granted…. It’s still about how you perform on that day and having everyone looking to win that title. We’re capable of doing [it], so it’s important to really try and focus and get perform the best you can on the day.”
Harvard posted a slow start, losing the first two matches.
Princeton’s All-American Samuel Kang took the No. 1 spot against Dhingra in four games. Dhingra had a close 13-11 win in the first set, but could not keep the momentum going, losing the next three to lose the match, 3-1.
Murray also fell to another Princeton All-American, Tyler Osborne, losing three straight sets.
The tide turned for Harvard after that, with the squad dominating the next seven games.
Ryan started his Crimson career with a sweep against the Tigers’ Taylor Tutrone at the No. 5 spot.
Fellow freshman Mandela Patrick also recorded his first win of the season with a 3-1 result against Ben Leizman in the No. 9 spot.
Olson clinched his fourth victory of the season, taking the No. 8 spot, winning 3-1 against Abhimanyu Shah.
Smith, McLaughlin, and sophomore Bryan Koh also swept their opponents. Roberts defeated Sam Ezratty in the longest match of the meet, taking five sets to win.
“Over the last two matches I performed pretty well,” McLaughlin said. “Definitely a lot better than before J-term. I had a tough first few matches, but I came out a lot stronger after Christmas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 6/6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team notched its eighth and ninth straight wins, respectively, on an upstate New York road trip to Union and Rensselaer this weekend.
On one end of the ice, goalkeepers Emerance Maschmeyer, Brianna Laing, and Molly Tissenbaum combined for a near shutout over the pair—Maschmeyer and Tissenbaum each let in one goal—while on the other, freshman forward Lexie Laing notched two goals in both games.
The wins continue a pattern of hearty Crimson (11-2-2, 9-1-1 ECAC) defense in the second half of the season that has allowed no more than one goal per game against league opponents.
HARVARD 4, RENSSELAER 1
On Saturday afternoon in Troy, N.Y., Harvard downed RPI (4-15-3, 2-8-0) with the same score, 4-1, that it did early in the season at home in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The Crimson struck thrice in the first frame as the first-year Laing took an assist from junior Mary Parker and sophomore Abbey Frazer to sneak the puck past Engineers goalie Kelly O’Brien. Exactly 10 minutes later, Parker and freshman Karly Heffernan provided another feed that allowed Laing to score yet again. Senior Sarah Edney closed out the frame with another strike to put the Crimson on top, 3-0, heading into the first intermission.
It took nearly two periods for Harvard to score again. A back-and-forth second stanza saw no scoring action for either team, and the same was true for the third period until Parker nabbed an empty netter with just under two and a half minutes to go in the contest.
Maschmeyer almost closed out the game with the team’s third shutout of the season, but a man-up situation for RPI proved too much to handle in the final minutes as Engineers forward Taylor Mahoney scored the only goal for her team on the power play with 38 seconds to go.
HARVARD 7, UNION 1
Yet again, it was Lexie Laing who provided offensive fuel for the Crimson in another near shutout at Union (4-15-3, 1-9-0) on Friday. The 7-1 win marked the team’s third game this season with a margin of victory of six goals.
Laing provided both the first and last goals of the game for the Crimson and chipped in two assists, both in the first period, for a career-high four points. Her older sister Brianna, a sophomore, guarded the net for the first two periods to record her fifth win—and start—of the season, shutting out the nine shots sent her way by the Dutchwomen.
Tissenbaum, who recorded her first career start and win against Union at home in November, relieved Brianna Laing in the third frame to scramble for nine saves and allow one goal, which came from the stick of Union forward Hannah Erickson with just under 10 minutes left in the contest.
The win was one full of offensive intensity, as Harvard recorded 31 shots on goal to Union’s 19, capitalized on one of its two power play opportunities, and saw six different members of the roster score a goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days after going down early, coming back quickly, and ultimately falling short against Maryland, the Harvard wrestling team entered a pair of Sunday dual meets in Washington, D.C. with a chance for redemption.
“We were very motivated after the loss to Maryland,” senior Ryan Osleeb said. “The dual was a close, hard-fought bout against a good team, so we came out…with that extra motivation to perform well.”
Redemption came, but it only lasted three hours. After beginning the day with a convincing rout of the Virginia Military Institute, the Crimson suffered another close loss, this time against American University.
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY 22, HARVARD 19
Wrestling on the Eagles’ home mat in Washington, D.C., Harvard relived the same painful narrative that described Friday’s 21-18 loss to Maryland.
Drop four of the first five bouts. Mount a momentum-swinging comeback. Lose by three points anyway.
“Obviously we are pretty upset with the losses,” co-captain James Fox said. “But in no way are we discouraged or disappointed because we actually performed pretty well. We did a good job, especially in the second half of the lineup, of battling back after being down early.”
Junior Michael Mocco encapsulated the Crimson’s down-up-down storyline. After erasing a 3-1 deficit, Mocco tied the 184 lb. bout at 5-5. However, his American opponent regained the lead with a third-period point to take the match, 6-5, and push the overall score to 22-11.
Mocco’s match came in the middle of a streak of Harvard-won bouts, beginning with the 165 lb. weight class. Sophomore Tyler Grimaldi claimed that one, 11-3. Soon after, freshman Josef Johnson won at 174 lb. thanks to a trio of first-period takedowns.
No. 11 Fox responded to Mocco’s loss by putting on a dominant 18-5 performance that featured a 10-point lead heading into the third period. Senior David Ng followed suit with a bonus-point win.
The going was not always so easy. In the 149 lb. weight class, the Eagles’ Tom Page shut out junior Nick Stager, 7-0. Immediately after, freshman Tyler Tarsi dropped his bout on an early fall, which stretched the Crimson’s deficit to 16 points. The visitors also gave away six points by forfeiting the 125 lb. match.
Co-captain Todd Preston recorded the lone win of these early bouts. After Osleeb fell 9-0 to the Eagles’ Josh Terao at 133 lbs., No. 16 Preston earned the team’s first points with his 10-3 victory in the 141 lb. category.
“We are going to have a great week of training,” Osleeb said. “In our mat practice, [we’ll] go over and fix the mistakes we made this previous weekend.”
HARVARD 31, VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE 12
When the first Harvard wrestler stepped onto the mat at Bender Arena, the Crimson was already behind by six points due to a forfeit in the 125 lb. weight class.
Once the bouts began, however, the final result was hardly in question. On the strength of an overall 16-0 run to start the meet, Harvard turned in a dominating performance against VMI.
“VMI has really tough and strong kids, but we were able to outwrestle them,” Fox said. “We were also able to get a lot of bonus points.”
The match ended with a bang as junior Josh Popple and Ng pinned their opponents at 197 lb. and 285 lb., respectively. These bouts followed Mocco’s 8-7 defeat in the 184 lb. category, which put the overall score at 19-12.
At 157 lb., Tarsi also earned a win by fall after only 49 seconds.
Tarsi’s victory was the final act of the 16-point streak that began with Osleeb’s 6-2 decision over the Keydets’ Hunter Starner in the 133 lb. weight class. Wrestling at 141 lb., Preston contributed another 6-2 win to tie the meet, and Stager forged an overall lead with a 13-5 victory in the 149 lb. category.
A 11-4 loss by Grimaldi halted the momentum—but not for long. With a 7-5 victory, the first-year Johnson established a 19-9 lead and extended a personal three-match win streak in dual meets.
“We believe we can win,” Fox said. “We’ve proven that to ourselves this weekend in our performance. It’s just going to take a little bit more effort from each of our nine starters…to win those close matches.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week after rising to its highest poll position in school history, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team took a small step back on Monday.
After falling 4-1 to Yale on Saturday, the Crimson (10-2-2, 6-1-2 ECAC) dropped one spot from third to fourth in both the USCHO.com and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls. Harvard also spent three weeks at No. 4/4 from December 15 to January 5 during the winter break.
Leapfrogging the Crimson was Minnesota State, who made the jump from fourth to first in both polls. North Dakota and crosstown rival Boston University rounded out the top three, with UND receiving a slight edge from USA Today and BU having the advantage according to USCHO.com.
Despite its latest loss, Harvard still earned five first-place votes in each poll. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs, who had their way with the Crimson on Saturday, rose one spot to No. 18 in the USCHO.com poll.
Harvard saw its position in the PairWise, RPI, and KRACH rankings slip as well. After topping all three polls last week, the Crimson came in at No. 2 in the PairWise and RPI rankings and No. 4 in the KRACH poll on Monday.
Through 14 games, Harvard is out to its best start since 1992-1993. The Crimson had won seven consecutive games heading into its latest contest at Madison Square Garden against Yale—the only team that has beat Harvard all season.
The Crimson will look to rebound this weekend as it resumes conference play at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center against Clarkson and St. Lawrence.
