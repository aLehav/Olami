After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 3:33 p.m.
 
An unidentified man was found on the top step of Memorial Church in Tercentenary Theatre this morning after fatally shooting himself.
 
"A man suffered a self-inflicted gun shot wound in the Yard," a University spokesperson confirmed. "There is no ongoing threat to the campus."
Cambridge Fire and Rescue pronounced the individual deceased, according to a community advisory issued by the Harvard University Police Department. An individual with close knowledge of the incident said that it appeared that he is not affiliated with Harvard University.
"At this time, we believe this is an isolated incident and there is no continuing safety threat to the community," said HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano, who could not provide further details or comment at the time.
 
 
Middlesex District Attorney's office spokesperson Jessica Venezia Pastore said that the death "does not appear suspicious nor does it involve foul play." For that reason, she declined to comment on what type of gun was used, citing department policy not to release details on incidents that do not appear to involve criminal activity.
 
 
Local and state police and the Middlesex District Attorney’s office are helping HUPD investigate the incident, according to a statement from the Cambridge Police Department.
At  the time of the shooting, a tour group posing for a photo had been  standing on the steps of Memorial Church facing Tercentenary Theatre.  While they were standing on the steps, the man shot himself and the  people on the steps took off running across the grass, said Jorge A. Araya '14, who had been walking by Emerson Hall at the time.
Katherine C. Mentzinger '14, a resident of Thayer Hall, said that she saw the body from her friend’s room in the dorm and heard one gunshot.
 
"From my friend’s window, I could see him in a pool of blood," she said.
 
Thayer resident Nathaniel J. Miller '14 said that people in his dorm were "shaken a little bit, but no one is too hysterical."
 
Mentzinger said she saw a tour group that had been in the area during the shooting taken aside to be questioned by police. Many of the individuals at the scene of the incident were crying, according to Mentzinger.
 
At least 10 officers were responding to the incident just after 11 a.m. on Saturday. An officer with the Cambridge Police Department said earlier this morning, at the scene of the incident, "There’s a body and he's been shot."
 
Memorial Church Minister Dorothy A. Austin, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, and Secretary of the Administrative Board John "Jay" L. Ellison were also present.
 
Officers marked off the scene of the shooting and the surrounding yard with yellow tape. Entrances to the yard were restricted, with gates on Quincy Street near Lamont Library and Loeb House closed, as well as all but one gate by the Science Center.
 
Most of the individuals who exited Memorial Church around 12:30 p.m. when Yom Kippur services ended were not aware that a shooting had taken place just a few feet outside of where they had been observing the holiday.
Attendees—many of whom found out about the news from inquiring reporters—said that they had not been informed of the shooting during the service. Though two police officers entered the church toward the beginning of services, there was no sense of alarm or panic, they said.
 
A message sent by Harvard’s emergency notification system around 12:22 p.m. read: “Man in Harvard Yard suffered self-inflicted gunshot wound. Incident Over. No Ongoing Threat.”
 
At that time, the man remained lying on his back on the steps of Memorial Church.
 
While police milled about the east side of the Yard, tours continued on the opposite side of University Hall where people blithely continued rubbing the foot of the John Harvard statue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of the football season is just hours ahead of us, but before we delve into a whirlwind 10-game season, The Back Page took some time to check in with Harvard coach Tim Murphy to talk about the Crimson’s upcoming opponent—Holy Cross—the benefit of night games, and the looming concern about ongoing concussions. On Monday, look for Murphy’s sound off about Harvard’s opening effort on the gridiron.
 
What Murphy said: “Obviously having the benefit of playing their third game, [Holy Cross has] worked some kinks out. I think they know where they are [personnel-wise], they’re probably a little bit more disciplined than you are the first game in terms of penalties and things like that.”
What Murphy means: On paper, the Crimson should be a better team than Holy Cross. The Crusaders lost their NFL-caliber quarterback Dominic Randolph to graduation, and, following a 31-7 drubbing at the hands of Massachusetts, the team does not appear strong coming into tonight’s contest. Nonetheless, “discipline” goes a long way early in the season, and Murphy will have to make sure that his players are ready for a well-prepared opponent. It would be shocking if this game were a shootout with both squads breaking in new quarterbacks, so, as Murphy emphasized in the preseason, mistake-free football will prove key for a victory under the lights.
What Murphy said: “So many of these kids grew up with high school football on Friday nights, and with the atmosphere we’ve had the last couple of years for the Holy Cross and Brown games, yeah, our kids are really excited [for the night game]. We hope that the students and the alumni are just as excited, because we’d love to see a great turnout.”
What Murphy means: Basically, Murphy is politely side-stepping the fact that half of the Harvard football team enjoyed bigger crowds at their high school games than they do on an average Saturday in Cambridge. It is not surprising the athletes get pumped up for the night game, because who doesn’t enjoy the spotlight every once in awhile? Unfortunately, until the Crimson fans figure out a few cheers beyond “Let’s go Harvard!” the atmosphere will continue to be underwhelming by BCS standards, but the night game has indeed proven to be an exciting event for everyone involved the last three years.
What Murphy said: “There’s been, from my understanding, a standardization of the process or protocol you go through [with concussions]. So the bottom line is that a), it’s much different from when I played, and it’s much different even from 10 years ago. At the end, it’s whatever the doctors tell us, and it’s, if my trainer and my doctor say this kid’s not going to be ready to play, there’s no conversation. And that’s a good thing, it really is.”
What Murphy means: Everywhere you turn in organized football these days, it seems the concussion conversation is unavoidable. Important precautions have been taken at all levels to begin protecting players more effectively, and the Ivy League is no different. Already we’ve had the August announcement that wedge blocking on kickoffs (already banned in the NFL) will no longer be permitted in the NCAA to avoid monstrous hits on unsuspecting special teams players, and the recent revelation that Penn captain Owen Thomas suffered brain injuries stemming from repeated trauma prior to his April suicide has returned the issue to the forefront of the Ancient Eight. Hopefully, with the new rules and precautions in place, such tragedies will become a thing of the past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson confirmed today that men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has secured a verbal commitment from 2011 big man Kenyatta Smith.
The No. 13 center in the nation according to Scout.com, Smith, a senior at Flintridge Prep School (La Canada Flintridge, Calif.) chose Harvard over Vanderbilt and league rival Penn.
“It was just a great visit. I love the campus; I love the people, everything—just beautiful,” the 6'8, 255-lb Smith said while in attendance at the Crimson football team’s opener against Holy Cross Saturday night.
“I thought about [visiting other schools], but I’ve been to Penn before. I saw the campus and everything, and I just didn’t feel the connection that I did here,” Smith said of his first visit to the area. “I just love Boston as a city.”
Smith sounded unfazed by Harvard’s lack of long-standing men’s basketball success.
“We haven’t had a lot of history of winning, but that’s what I want to be a part of,” Smith said. “I want to start a history of winning, a tradition. I want to be there when that first happens—and I know it’s going to happen. It’s coming soon, and I want to be a part of it.”
Giving Amaker a much-needed front court boost, Smith joins Minnesota forward Jonah Travis in the Crimson’s future class of 2015. Prospects Andre Hollins, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Steve Moundou-Missi also took in the football game.

For the fourth consecutive season, Harvard is holding its first home football game under the lights with a night game, this year against Holy Cross. Whether you're interested in football or don't care much for the sport, here's the information you need to know.
The Football
The game starts tonight at Harvard Stadium at 7 p.m.
If you're not able to get to the game, The Crimson's sports board is live-blogging it here. And regardless of whether you're able to make it, read our interview with football Head Coach Tim Murphy.
The Non-Football
The Undergraduate Council is partnering with the Department of Athletics to hold a tailgate tonight. A barbecue that started at the top of this hour will serve the first 250 students who arrive, and students who enter a free raffle could win an iPad, as well as, in the words of the UC's e-mail, "other great prizes."
If you're going, make sure you enter through the student entrance, since that's where they're handing out free pom-poms.
Shuttles are running continuously, picking up students from the Quad and the Yard.

A petition that urges HUHDS (that’s HUDS with an H, for those who forgot) to reduce its service of meat has been making rounds over House e-mail lists, spurring some conversation about its merits.
So we called up the student behind the petition—Talia B. Lavin '12, the creator of the Harvard Meat Less Initiative—to find out what she hopes will come out of her efforts and why she believes in this cause.
“I’ve read Fast Food Nation, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, and Food Politics, and I’ve seen Food, Inc., Super Size Me, and The Future of Food,” Lavin said. “I went to see Jonathan Safran Foer speak about his book Eating Animals, and I thought I should finally do something.”
The petition commends HUHDS for its "efforts to create a more sustainable and thoughtful dining hall environment" and "general commitment to local, environmentally responsible cuisine."
But the amount of meat HUHDS serves undermines these efforts because it is detrimental to the environment, the petition says.
Lavin suggested omitting meat entrées for one meal a day or one day a week, which she said would have a substantial effect given the size of the College’s student body.
"It’d be good for vegetarians who suffer from the lack of options, not to mention it’s a cost-saving measure," said Lavin. But she added that she is most concerned with the environment and bringing attention to the "very shitty state of contemporary animal agriculture."
Lavin, who admitted she is not a vegetarian, said she is not trying to crusade for animal rights.
"I try to have at least one meal a day where I don’t eat meat, and I’m working to increase that," she said.
Lavin’s goal is for the petition to receive 800 signatures, and she has been amassing signatories through House lists and friends. She said she plans to push the petition’s presence over open lists and is considering tabling in the dining halls.
"I think HUHDS is a very responsive program because it has such a direct relationship with the students," Lavin said when asked about the effectiveness of her campaign. "If they have 6,000 people to serve and 800 people want less meat, I think they’ll listen."
Lavin said she is aware that some students disagree with the cause driving the petition, but she added that she is insistent on seeing this project through to its completion.
"It’d be interesting to hear what the other side has to say," she said. "But I have some pretty strong arguments against them."

Mackenzie J. Lowry ’11 and Merritt A. Moore ’11 were featured in Glamour Magazine as the “Top 10 College Women of 2010.”
Lowry, who told Glamour she wants to be “a policy adviser to the President on health care,” earned the title “The Politician” in the magazine, while Moore was named “The Renaissance Woman” for her dream of being the “best dancer [she] can be—and become an adviser for nuclear weapon nonproliferation.”
The Politician
Lowry, a Dunster House resident, said she first heard about the annual competition in middle school. She still remembers flipping through the magazine and admiring the women who were profiled.
Lowry said the most valuable part about winning the competition was being able to express her cause at a national level. Having lost her father to lung cancer as a teenager, Lowry worked with local anti-tobacco advocates and pushed for a cigarette tax increase law in her home state of Iowa.
The Renaissance Woman
Moore has two passions that, at first, seem remarkably divergent: ballet and physics.
Growing up, Moore said she was repeatedly told that she couldn’t pursue both and that she had to choose between the two.
“But you don’t have to sacrifice,” Moore said in an interview. “Opposite dreams complement each other really well.”
Moore’s mentor and dance teacher in Los Angeles encouraged her to apply for the competition, she said. Currently on a leave of absence to dance professionally with Boston Ballet, Moore said she wants to eventually earn a Ph.D. in physics, in addition to dancing professionally.
The Competition
Glamour’s competition showcases female college students for their academic excellence and unique achievements.
Next year’s winners will be profiled in the magazine and receive a three-night trip to New York City. If you’re a junior and interested in being among the next top college women, download the application package here and send it in by Dec. 1.
