How do we as humans cope with grief—is there a formula for healing? “The Thing About Air Travel,” which opens tonight at the Loeb Ex, presents a main character who deals with the loss of her brother by imagining him as a dog. By incorporating surrealist elements, up-and-coming playwright Max Posner lightens the otherwise melancholy premise of a family trying to deal with a significant loss.
 
The fast-paced and fluid 75-minute play is filled with quick exchanges of dialogue and quirky characters such as Marie (Maya M. Park ’16), the sister dealing with the death of her brother, the dog (Bryan D. Kauder ’14). Meant to illustrate Marie’s inner psyche, the play transitions through her stream of consciousness; her thoughts or hallucinations are actualized in front of the audience, illustrating another aspect of the surrealism present throughout the show. 
The set, designed by Daniel J. Prosky ’16 and director Jacob A. Brandt ’14, is vital in facilitating the transition between Marie’s thoughts and reality. With only two airplane chairs elevated on a platform, the set’s aesthetic simplicity allows the audience to focus on the show’s complex story and themes.
 
Brandt says that the executive team has been working closely with the playwright, who will be attending one of the performances. “It’s exciting to work with someone who is close to our age and who is making really amazing theater,” Brandt says. “I am really excited to bring it to Harvard.”

It’s been over a decade since Rosalind Wiseman’s “Queen Bees & Wannabes,” the nonfiction book about female bullying that served as the source material for “Mean Girls,” was released. This month, its male counterpart “Masterminds and Wingmen” hit shelves. In an interview with The Crimson Wiseman talked about the complex concept of “boy world,” the possibility of “Mean Guys” coming to screens sometime soon, and the complications of race and masculinity.

 
The Harvard Crimson: Do you think “Mean Girls” accurately espouses the ideas you wrote about in “Queen Bees and Wannabes?”
 
Rosalind Wiseman: Yes and no. First of all, teenage girls are always going to subvert what I do. I remember the first time I saw a horde of teenage girls dressed up like “The Plastics” for Halloween, [and I thought] “Of course. Of course they’re going to do that. They’re certainly not getting the lesson here.” At the same time, it’s awesome because schools around the country use [“Mean Girls”] in their psychology classes and use it for discussions on teenagers, and that’s great. On the other side, girls who try to claim social power looked at “Mean Girls” as verification or reinforcement for why they have power.
 
THC: Can you talk about “The Guide: Managing Douchebags, Recruiting Wingmen, and Attracting Who You Want,” the companion book to “Masterminds”?
 
RW: “The Guide” is an eBook only, but it’s free on Amazon (I didn’t want there to be any barriers to entry). My original idea was to write a book for high school boys and only them, because I wanted to give boys a guide that they could have on their phone. If they think, “This girl makes me miserable… this guy makes me miserable… my parents make me miserable…” or whatever it is, they could have this thing they take out and go, “Ok, girl making me miserable—go to page 87.”
 
THC: There seems to be a wealth of mainstream movies about “girl world” and girl-to-girl relationships—for example, “Clueless,” “Jawbreaker,” “Heathers,” and of course “Mean Girls”—and every generation seems to have its own. So why do male-centered high school movies focus on guys trying to get girls and not guy-to-guy relationships?
 
RW: This is something that I am focused on right now because there’s some amount of interest about taking “The Guide” and turning it into a movie. All of these boys movies have been done by men in their 40’s remembering their past (but not really) and not really being in touch with their adolescent selves. And so you get these really stereotypical, simple storylines. They think that all boys care about is eating nachos, drinking beer, and chasing women.
 
The men I’ve been working with for the [movie] pitch want to be able to do a movie that’s funny and really reflective of the complexity of boys’ friendships. The reason why I’m working with them is because they are so respectful and they acknowledge how weak these types of these movies have been in the past. They want to work with the boys that I’ve worked with [for “Masterminds”]. They want to be able to write a script and give it to them and say, “What do you think? What do we need to change? What makes this not realistic and funny?”
 
THC: “Masterminds” touches on the issue of racial slurs and some other race-related issues, but is there a reason you didn’t go even more in depth and talk about the stereotypes and pressures on minority boys to act hyper masculine?
 
RW: Parental anxiety is so high, and my job is to make people uncomfortable but not to the point of shutting down. I’m dealing with a majority of the country (white parents) who would never believe that their children could possibly do what I said are regular occurrences. It’s not that I have to placate them; it’s that I think a lot about how to present information so that people will be able to engage in a meaningful conversation about it. That’s why I chose to include what I did.
 
I think that based on your question you’re thinking, “There could have been so many more interesting and more in-depth things about hypermasculinity and black culture and black men only being able to express that part of their masculinity.” I think your generation is much closer to their understanding of how class and power and [masculinity] work in our culture. But I know most parents don’t have a clue. What I’m saying to a group of white parents is essentially, “You have an issue with your son sneaking out at night and you’re concerned about the trust between the two of you.”  But for a black young man, when he goes out in sweatpants because he wants to look like he’s ready for bed, if he gets caught sneaking out it’s a whole different set of issues when he’s on the street. I’ve said that to parents in presentations and they are floored. With “The Guide” I was much more straightforward. [Your generation] has the language that I believe most parents wouldn’t have in their minds.

Ron Howard’s “Rush” isn’t just a film about racing. While it captures the opulence and glamor inherent in Formula One through a virtuosic display of directing and cinematography, it also asks a deeper question: what is the psyche of a man who not only looks death in the face, but also relishes the risk of death? The scope is wide but nuanced, developing layers of a story that could have easily become oversimplified. With exceptional performances from its leads and a tight, thoughtful screenplay, “Rush” transcends the limitations of the sports genre to explore the fine line between life and death.
The film follows one of the most passionate rivalries in Formula One history, that between racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). Hunt, who famously had the phrase “Sex, breakfast for champions” sewn onto his uniform, is wild and magnetically charismatic, providing the perfect contrast to the austere, acerbic Lauda, known as “The Rat” by his competitors. Where Hunt succeeds by his brute speed on the track, Lauda does the same with his technical genius and precision. The film focuses on the 1976 Formula One season, when the rivalry between the two came to a head.
It would be too easy to make Hunt, an underdog, into the film’s hero while relegating Lauda’s role to that of a villain. Screenwriter Peter Morgan refuses to reduce his characters to such rudimentary roles. Morgan makes great use of parallelism, which is apparent from the beginning, in which both drivers narrate their bland familial backgrounds, highlighting the inherent similarities despite their stark differences in personality. The choice to create a binary plotline provides insight into each of the men’s characters that could not be achieved otherwise. It is Lauda, however, with his stone-cold pragmatism, rather than Hunt who emerges as the grounding force of the narrative, and the film is better for it by avoiding black and white characterizations. The freshness in Morgan’s script lies in the fact that it is not about the triumph of one racer over the other: while the film structurally follows typical sports movie protocol, it doesn’t fall to its narrative clichés.
It’s at the racetrack, filmed with great care and meticulousness, where the film hits its stride. The races are not perfunctory; they are directed with purpose, with the right mix of introspection and action to emphasize the stakes. “I accept every time I get in my car there is a 20 percent chance I will die,” says Lauda to his fellow racers. Howard makes this sentiment clear. The visuals of the engines revving up are paired with an outstanding score from Hans Zimmer, interspersed with moments of opportune silence as Lauda and Hunt attempt to weave their way around the track, creating an exhilarating and tense experience. Playing with perspectives, Howard lends many scenes believability by acknowledging different viewpoints: the driver, the general public, and the spectators. By doing so, he breathes life into many scenes that could otherwise feel stagnant.
The actors behind the wheel, Hemsworth and Brühl, display an easy chemistry and find the right mixture of contempt and respect between Hunt and Lauda. Hemsworth plays Hunt wonderfully as carefree with the perfect amount of self-awareness, but it is ultimately Brühl who steals the attention from his co-star with his precise, multi-layered portrayal of Lauda. Though Brühl mimics Lauda’s Austrian-inflected English and mannerism to perfection, Brühl’s successful performance rests on his ability to humanize and develop Lauda’s character.
Unlike Hunt, Lauda was not naturally gregarious, and at times was somewhat difficult due to his straightforward personality. Brühl fully encompasses the nastier parts of Lauda’s personality, but also shows a man capable of great love and a character of unparalleled resilience. In the film, Lauda suffers a near-fatal accident, severely burning his body and most of his face. Brühl exposes Lauda’s frustrations and stubbornness to return on the track with heartbreaking intensity as he goes through the excruciating routine of mechanically pumping his lungs and replacing his bandages all while seething and watching Hunt win more and more races. The scene is a turning point in the film, and Brühl magnificently acquits himself to changing the film’s emotional tide.
After two lackluster, critically panned films, “Rush” shows Howard back in top form. Evoking the danger and adrenaline of Formula One in the ’70s, “Rush” is able to retain its blockbuster appeal while providing enough evocative human drama to complicate its narrative.

Take a moment and close your eyes. Imagine a movie where an alcoholic athlete turned coach (in this case, Josh Holloway of “Lost” fame) is reeled into a rich man’s plan to put together an all-star team of (insert favorite athletic event here) and win the world championship of said sport. Turn to your friends and note the many films that come to mind. “Battle of the Year” is the essence of all these films, plus incredible breakdancing, without any plot substance.
The story unfolds in a boring, one-dimensional manner.  Jason (Holloway) is a retired dancer who has also seen success as a basketball coach due to his unusual knack for fostering teamwork and morale among teammates. However, his life is in alcoholic shambles after his wife and child die in a car accident. Dante (Laz Alonso), a member of Jason’s old crew, is now a big-time entertainment CEO with a vision for the next winner of Battle of the Year, the world’s biggest breakdancing competition. After Dante convinces Jason to return to his roots and train a new team, the story takes off in a series of tedious problems and plot twists.
As the team trains with Jason for a chance at breakdancing glory, each main character on the team is revealed to have beef with another team member. Within badly acted five-minute segments, each two feuding members work out their problems through various monotonous conversations. During these sequences, the acting is vaguely reminiscent of the free intro session of an improv class before the talentless ones have given up and left. One scene in particular features a supporting character standing stiffly with his arms at his side in the midst of his team and yelling in a monotone voice for almost two minutes. His speech, along with his half-hearted flipping of a chair to punctuate his words, is typical of these characters, great dancers with the apparent emotional capacity of five-year-olds.
“Battle of the Year” also takes sponsorship pandering to brand new heights. From an opening scene in which Josh Peck’s character Franklyn expresses his love for the new Sony Tablet, to an average of one Braun ad per scene, to a new Chris Brown single playing over the end credits, “Battle” continuously and unabashedly references its sponsors throughout the film—the movie has more ads in it than Times Square. Regardless of the movie’s attempts at making the most obvious moments of ad placement self-aware and humorous, the gratuitous product placement in “Battle of the Year” detract away from the experience.
Braun is the sponsor of the real-life event Battle of the Year, and it’s understandable, if not excusable, that they advertise themselves so aggressively. On the positive side, everything to do with the Battle of the Year competition itself is spot on throughout the movie. The dancers take choreographed dance sequences to a whole new level as they slide, flip, and spin around the stage with impressive grace and athleticism. The film is at its most enjoyable in the moments when the 3D cameras close in on groups of ten people dancing in tandem, or track a single dancer’s impressive head spin. At certain strategic points, time slows down à la “300,” allowing a heightened appreciation of an especially skillful movement. As bad as the movie’s acting and plot are, the dancing itself is highly enjoyable for its artistry and originality. Each national team has a clear style and technique, and the team members’ personalities shine through much more on the dance floor than in the locker room.
“Battle of the Year” is either a terrible attempt at portraying hip-hop and breaking culture or a self-indulgent sports movie cliché fest, but it never seems to decide which film to be. Is “Battle” suggesting that members of the hip-hop community are this simple and one-dimensional, or is this entire thing a farce with good dancing? Who thought it was a good idea to cast Holloway as a retired break dancer? Why is Josh Peck telling us that Jews can’t dance? Was that men’s razor company in the last scene “Braun” or “Baum?” In between some great dancing, “Battle of the Year” will leave you struggling with all these questions and more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, I was one of the lucky freshmen who quickly met her best friend on move-in day. It had almost seemed like our identical personalities had led two lives in different bodies that grew up on opposite coasts. I am an Asian American proudly representing the suburbs of Los Angeles, while my African American friend hails from a suburb near Washington, D.C. After discovering our uncanny parallels in scathing, sarcastic humor, a secret love for Dancing with the Stars, and a preference for Otto’s Pizza over Noch’s within two weeks of our first encounter, we easily became best friends. As the year went along, our friendship, aided by late night adventures with our main group of friends, helped us maintain sanity against the piling pressure of LS1a p-sets, extracurricular commitments, and homesickness. Moreover, as our friendship grew deeper, so did our conversations, reflecting our growing comfort in expressing our personal opinions, critiques, and concerns with each another.
Looking back, one of the greatest moments of our friendship was the night after we both attended our first freshman party—Rush Hour (yes, fitting). After laughing at encounters with awkward freshman boys, Alexis casually told me: “I really don’t know how to dance to ‘ratchet’ music; in high school, I was always called an ‘Oreo.’” She went on to explain how she had attained the Oreo label through her inability to connect with the black community. She was a black woman who embodied “white” characteristics. As our conversations continued throughout the year, she pondered whether it was her preference for alternative rock over hip hop, penchant for astronomy, or inability to “twerk” that reinforced this designation that still held personal sway as she tried to come to terms with the person she should become in college. By the end of these conversations, she reached the conclusion that she simply did not fit into the societal mold of a modern day black woman in America.
As an Asian-American woman who has similarly been labeled a “Twinkie” in high school, I can relate to Alexis’s frustrations. I was seen as an Asian American who personified “white” qualities. Though my mom is an immigrant from the Philippines and my dad is fluent in Cantonese, my associations with my Asian heritage are limited to my grandmas’ undeniably delicious Chinese/Filipino food during the holidays. Unlike the societal stereotypes of Asian-American women, I suck at math, can’t understand CS to save my life, lack the ability to speak Cantonese or Tagalog fluently, and embrace public speaking. I never gave much thought to my status as an Asian American after living my life in the diversified suburbs of Southern California, yet my freshman year forced me to reevaluate this identity—speculating whether my disinterest in joining Asian cultural groups on campus failed to make me “Asian enough.” While many of my friends have pressured me to become more involved in these cultural groups, I have politely declined; I fear that my associations with my Asian heritage aren’t strong enough for me to truly fit in with these organizations. Was I an Asian American woman who failed to “live up” to my own culture? If I failed to adhere to the stereotype of Asian women, wasn’t that a good thing? In order to reinforce my “Asian-ness”, must I spend time with Asian people? I noticed many individuals settling into racially segregated social groups outside of classes and extracurricular commitments, and I hesitated to devote more social time to the exploration of my Asian-American identity. While joining these groups would allow me to be seen as “more Asian” in appearance, my hesitation would have inevitably me led me to be even more disillusioned in thought. I embraced my closest friendships with friends like Alexis, as I felt our diversity breaking down the natural segregation of social groups on campus.
As we begin our sophomore year together, Alexis and I have sought to pursue various avenues to help us identify with our ethnic cultures. Alexis has expressed interest in possibly being involved in more black cultural groups after being enthusiastically welcomed by student leaders at the activities fair. I’m taking a WGS class on Asian-American feminist literature and the popular gen-ed class on classical Chinese philosophy. While I aim to explore my Chinese and Filipino roots through an academic standpoint this year, I am still hesitant to explore my ethnicity through more extracurricular involvement. After living with the label of being a “Twinkie” for so long, I cannot help but be anxious as to whether I will truly be able to develop a holistic understanding of my identity. Amidst the many sophomore struggles that have already arisen, the tales of my roommate and me—the “Oreo” and the “Twinkie”—continue to unfold together.

We’ve all been to yogurtland. The neon-and-antiseptic walls, the nave-like proportions; the blessed infinity of choices. The soulless negative of a charming, family-owned ice cream shop, but less likely to stop your heart. Self-serve frozen yogurt is the undisputed “in” dessert of the global bourgeoisie—but nary a good enough yogurt joint for the job in Harvard Square, the fermented dairy delight’s ideal market.
Until now: enter Yogurtland—capital Y—perched tastily between Maharaja and Bon Chon, its all-glass storefront beguiling the crowds of Winthrop Park. Its product—some dozen flavors of take-however-much-you-want, top-how-you-like, weigh-by-the-ounce yogurt—knocks the daylights out of vaunted neighborhood incumbents Berry Line and Pinkberry, which dispense yogurt behind the counter in fixed, unfree increments. No better place to throw my lactose intolerance to the wind, I remark to my roommates almost every other night as we round the corner to the coolest new place this side of Beat Hotel.
It is also perhaps the strangest. The presentation of a student ID (or sometimes, just a good-faith disclosure of student status) gets you three free ounces off the bat. With some audacity, you can manage six by getting seconds. The policy seems to be indefinite. Strawberries steep and bob in a water cooler up in a front alcove, flanked on each side by four stylized eyes. Your refreshing strawberry water—and all the rest!—brought to you by CBS.
Within a week of my first visit to Yogurtland, what was initially an innocent story of “too good to be true” took an otherworldly turn: The store was transfigured into a dairy-dispensing outlet of media giant CBS. My favorite flavors were either replaced or renamed by ill-conceived puns on the network’s lowbrow lineup—“Two and a Half Pistachios”, “How I Met Your Mocha”, and so on. Promotional posters ran the length and breadth of the storefront windows; as I rang up another free quarter-pound of yogurt, a ghastly scene from “Two and a Half Men” (now utterly worthless without Charlie Sheen) played over the register. “Don’t forget to come back on the 23rd!” the cashier called out. “Up to eight ounces free!”
On the 23rd, I showed up, was handed a cup, and received the debrief: “Make sure to watch new and old shows on the CBS line-up! Two Broke Girls! Two and a Half Men! Big Bang Theory! The Crazy Ones, with Robin Williams!”
“Robin Williams is a funny guy,” I admitted.
“Now go take as much as you want!”
After between 8 and 12 visits and plenty of amateur market-talk with friends, I think I’ve figured out the principles of Yogurtland’s business model.
1) Flood the market with a product so irresistibly superior and cheap that it washes the competition clear away.
2) Subsidize all-day, everyday free yogurt with ad money.
In other words: become the Facebook of yogurt. We’ve become accustomed to free, ad-powered and instantly gratifying services in the online realm—a great leveling of the information playing field, we’re told. But how about when the ad-powered service is a tangible thing as basic as food? Though not all would go as far as my roommate, who quips about Soylent Green, everyone who’s thought about it feels at least a bit off. Why?
In “Who Owns the Future?”, the newest jarring broadside against tech-triumphalism, industry guru Jaron Lanier attacks the idea of an online free lunch as anything but. Instagram, Google, and Amazon might very well make life easier and more expedient, but they concentrate data and creative revenue in the hands of few—leaving the middle-class well-plugged-in, but bereft of real opportunity. These “siren servers,” as he memorably terms them, present a Faustian bargain: Our free services for your valuable, money-making data.
The most orthodox form of the “siren server” scenario, reliant on seamless, massive transactions of data, is unlikely to hit offline markets any time soon. But the disaggregation of revenue from customer base—a looming possibility at Yogurtland—poses a radical question for businesses: To whom are we beholden—our product’s consumers or its backers?
It is admittedly hard to imagine any serious ill consequences of free, ad-backed “siren yogurt”—other than excessive exposure to “Two and a Half Men” and the replacement of taro-flavored purple stuff with a variety named after Liz Lemon. But look no further than my summer industry, the Israeli news media, for the real-life ramifications of new, non-customer-driven models of revenue.
From his air-conditioned Las Vegas perch, siren billionaire hack Sheldon Adelson threatens to do to The Jerusalem Post and Ha’aretz what Yogurtland seems poised to do to Berryline and Pinkberry: price them into oblivion with the help of a massive store of agenda-ridden capital.

In 2013, it’s certainly not easy to be a Catholic. Perhaps it has always been this way; after all, the great apostle Peter could not even muster up the courage to say he knew Jesus. And it would be foolish to believe that religion is supposed to be easy; if that were the case, everyone would do it—in the form of Pascal’s Wager at the very least. Yet, it probably isn’t supposed to be this difficult either. While I cannot reject the notion that my upbringing in a Catholic elementary school, wherein we had Friday Mass in addition to regular Sunday services, has skewed my interpretation of fin de siècle secularizing America, I still hypothesize that it has become significantly more difficult to be open about one’s Catholic faith in recent years. In the past two decades, we’ve lost both Pope John Paul II and the Soviet common enemy, a series of scandals has rocked the governance of the Church, and atheism, particularly New Atheism, which believes religion should be militantly countered, has become vogue.
Growing up, I was proud to call myself a Catholic and, even outside of religious circles, that confidence in my faith was looked upon with admiration rather than open scorn. In the past few years, my experience has shifted entirely: While still personally proud to be a member of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, I have done my best not to publicize my beliefs. Although it has been difficult for me to grapple with the exorbitant guilt that has risen out of this fact, I have rationalized my Peter-esque behavior with the belief that my reticence about my faith simply arises from the human condition. Humans can bear disagreements, but there is only so much derision and scorn even the most pious of sinners can take. Tired of being met with contumelies about pedophilia and the Hitler Youth, I am embarrassed to say that I have backed down from the calling of every baptized Catholic to serve as a modern fidei defensor.
Now, as if a reward to those who have remained faithful despite repeated temptations during time spent fasting in the Judaean desert, Catholics have been blessed with a new pope and, along with him, a transformation in the timbre of the conversation surrounding the Church. The liberal elite no longer finds Catholic religiosity completely indefensible—headlines about Pope Francis have taken a 180, praising both the content of his actions and the tone of his message. Even The Crimson supports the new pope, and while many secularists still take issue with aspects of Catholic dogma, suddenly Catholic identification is no longer equated with sympathy for pedophiles and evil (although the decline of the latter position may be due mostly due to the convergence of events that matched the death of Christopher Hitchens with the accession of a reformist pope).
All of a sudden, support for Catholicism no longer elicits eye rolls at best and vitriol at worst. While I wouldn’t go so far as to say that being Catholic is exactly a popular position, especially here at Harvard, the days of attending Mass being an inexpiable crime seem to be waning. Catholics—and I speak mainly for American Catholics—have Pope Francis to thank for this. Of course, stateside support for the pontifex goes beyond rising amour propre. I have to believe that most members of the American communion support the Vatican’s new style and could have only prayed for a pope with such an ability to connect with people. In fact, when I determined to write this column about Pope Francis, I planned to outline the reasons universal approbation is his condign desert.
After rumination and introspection, however, I realized that I could not in good faith write a boilerplate panegyric. Rather, my conscience necessitated that this column be an apology. As has happened many times throughout my life, the famed Catholic guilt has reared its head. It would be disingenuous to pretend all is well, as I come out of the woodwork as a fair-weather Catholic. After all, nothing about the Church proper or about Church doctrine has changed with the transition to Pope Francis. While I am glad that I feel better about my convictions and myself than I did two years ago, higher self-esteem does not atone for my previous taciturnity in matters concerning my religion. I really am proud to be a Catholic, and I always have been, although now I demonstrate my pride with less reserve. I am heartily sorry for my previous offenses to my identity, and I’d like to thank the pope both for his service to the Church and for the role he is playing in my continual effort of self-improvement.

On October 17, the United States will default on its debt for the first time. America will lose its pristine credit rating and taxpayers will suffer billions of dollars of borrowing cost increases. World markets that trade trillions of assets priced on Treasury rates will gyrate wildly, and the intangible and invaluable status of the federal government as the world’s most reliable investment will end. At least—if we are to take the Republican leadership at their word—these will be the consequences if President Obama and the Senate do not agree to accept a full slate of Republican demands in exchange for a hike in the debt ceiling.
In 2011, the last time the Republican Party manufactured a potential fiscal catastrophe, they demanded budgetary cuts to offset the proposed debt ceiling increase. Although we oppose any politicking with the credit of the United States, as Washington Post writer Ezra Klein has noted, there was some basic logic to their call for budget cuts. One could argue that they had received a mandate in the 2010 elections to reduce the deficit, and the raising of the debt ceiling afforded a moment of leverage to do so. This year’s demands, however, are hardly comprehensible as anything other than the worst kind of political blackmail. Aside from insisting on a delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the Republicans also demand that the president set a deadline for tax reform, approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, increase offshore oil drilling, and block most federal environmental regulations, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
The threat of debt default has never before been used to coerce any branch of government into accepting a full minority policy program. This endeavor is made all the more indefensible by the fact that the proposed demands so closely track the Romney-Ryan platform that was repudiated by voters last November. If the Republican Party wants to see its policies implemented, they ought to focus on winning elections rather than threatening irreversible financial and reputational harm to the country they serve. This tactic is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of public service; no political party should threaten financial disaster against its own nation in order to achieve any political goal.
To threaten a government shutdown, on the other hand, is a regrettable but tolerable element of politics. Media-starved members like Senator Ted Cruz can have their 21 hours of fame, for the scale of harm caused by disrupting government activity pales in comparison to that of weakened national credit.
However, no political minority ought to be able to demean the credit of the Federal government, on which we all depend, to win a political battle or two. For a small faction to wield such extraordinary power over the elected majority would be, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, “to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.” Credit such as that held by the federal government takes centuries to build and only moments to destroy. It will be a tragic day in America indeed if the whims of a cadre of House politicians discredit us all for a long time to come.

Harvard University will be adding the winner of a MacArthur “Genius” Grant to its music faculty in January of next year when renowned jazz musician and scholar Vijay Iyer takes up his post as the University’s first Franklin D. and Florence Rosenblatt Professor of the Arts.
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced Iyer as one of its awardees on Wednesday, calling him “an ardent investigator of musical communities, practices, histories, and theories” whose work is “richly varied” and “improvisation-driven.” The award, colloquially referred to as the “genius” grant, provides winners with $625,000 to use as they please. Twenty-four people were named MacArthur Fellows this year.
A jazz pianist and composer, Iyer has released 16 recordings. He also works in many disciplines beyond music—he graduated from Yale with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and physics and received a Masters in Physics and an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in the cognitive science of music from the University of California at Berkeley.
Music Department Chair Alexander Rehding said he is very excited for the interdisciplinary opportunities that will emerge once Iyer joins the department. “He links the creative arts with critical reception and even with work that connects into the cognitive sciences, and I think that this is an area which a lot of faculty and students are really excited about,” Rehding said. “The psychology department is really excited about having him here as well.”
Another member of the department, Senior Lecturer on Music and Director of Choral Activities Andrew G. Clark, said that he and other members of the faculty are eager to “welcome Vijay as a colleague and to benefit from his remarkable background as a performer, as a scholar, as a composer, and [as a] producer. I think it gives our students an opportunity to work with and learn with a world-class performing artist, and it provides a lot of exciting new opportunities for the department.”
Chase E. Morrin ’15, a junior in Quincy House, worked with Iyer this summer and said he is talented as a musician and an instructor. “I’ve always loved his music. I’ve really admired everything he’s done,” Morrin said. “This summer I got to work with him at the [Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music]. It was a really wonderful experience.”
“He’s a really wonderful teacher,” Morrin added. “Everything he says is really well thought out. You can tell he really takes the time to think about things and not just do them. I really admire that.”
According to Morrin, Iyer is also very approachable outside of the classroom. “He’s really nice. You can go talk to him. He always has something to say. I think just in general, it’s going to be a great thing that he’s there in the music department.”
The MacArthur Grant is not the first recognition of Iyer’s work. He was nominated for a Grammy in 2011 and has been named Pianist of the Year in the 2013 Jazz Awards for the second consecutive year.

Former psychology professor Marc D. Hauser will publish his first book since he resigned from the University two years ago following allegations of academic misconduct that were later corroborated by federal investigators.
Hauser’s new book, entitled “Evilicious: Cruelty = Desire + Denial,” examines the psychological motivations of malicious human behaviors. It will be released on Oct. 15, according to a tweet posted Wednesday on Hauser’s Twitter account.
The book will be available through self-publishing company CreateSpace and in digital form on Amazon Kindle, the tweet said. An undated post on Hauser’s blog said that “Evilicious” would also be available as an audio book on Audible.
Hauser began writing the book before he resigned from Harvard in the summer of 2011. Publishing company Viking Penguin had originally planned to publish the book, which was first titled “Evilicious: Explaining Our Evolved Taste for Being Bad.” Hauser did not respond to a request for comment Thursday night on whether he self-published the book.
According to the book’s prologue released on Hauser’s blog, “Evilicious” presents the argument that “evildoers are made in much the same way that addicts are made.” Hauser writes that the theory shines light on “not just the pathology of the sadist or the sexual predator but the actions of ‘ordinary’ individuals who perpetrate unimaginable cruelties.”
Hauser’s Harvard career was cut short following a series of events that began after some of his published findings were called into question. In 2010, it was revealed that after an internal investigation, a committee had found the popular psychology professor “solely responsible” for eight instances of academic misconduct in three published articles. Facing intense scrutiny, Hauser took a leave of absence in the 2010-2011 academic year before resigning from the University the following summer. Just over a year later, in the fall of 2012, the federal Office of Research Integrity also found Hauser guilty of academic misconduct following a two-year federal investigation.
Hauser’s new book has received positive reviews from a variety of journalists and academics, including MIT’s Noam Chomsky and Randy Cohen, former writer of The Ethicist column in the New York Times, according to posts on Hauser’s Twitter account and blog.
At least two of the reviewers said that Hauser’s previous alleged misconduct should not call into question the book’s integrity. In an interview, science writer Michael Shermer told the academic conduct blog Retraction Watch, “The book is based entirely on other people’s [empirical] work…so I felt that any research ethical questions on the part of Marc’s Harvard career were irrelevant in this case.”
In an email to The Crimson Thursday night, Hauser confirmed that while “Evilicious” is not informed by any of his own empirical research, it is a product of his own ideas.
Since leaving Harvard, Hauser has moved to “the second chapter of his career,” according to the website of his educational organization Risk-Eraser. The organization works to support at-risk students with educational programs that assess specific needs of children and reinforce critical thinking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jonathan Alter ’79 entertained a group of Harvard students on Thursday with colorful stories of recent presidential campaigns and the personal life of President Obama, explaining that our president is “fundamentally different in private and public.”
Alter, an award-winning author, reporter, columnist, and television analyst was the latest guest at Kirkland Conversations, the House’s tradition of hosting prominent individuals for conversations with students.
Alter spent much of the evening discussing last year’s presidential campaign, often drawing on his personal experiences on the campaign trail. He said that as a journalist who followed Obama from start to finish, he was exposed to a private side of Obama’s personality that others rarely see.
At one point, Alter highlighted the difference in the way Obama interacted with others at parties and the way former President Bill Clinton interacted.
“I argue that Obama is missing the schmooze gene that Clinton had,” Alter said. “Obama likes to hang out with his real friends, not his fake Washington friends.”
Explaining Obama’s inability to enact his legislative agenda, Alter said that the president may have had difficulty translating energy from the campaign into achieving his legislative agenda.
“We might be entering an era where Democrats win the popular vote and Republicans prosper in midterm elections,” Alter said.
Alter characterized the current political climate as a period of asymmetric polarization, in which Democrats are “a little left of center,” while Republicans are “really right of center.”
“Obama has the misfortune of being president during a time of greater radical Republicans,” Alter said.
Alter, a former Crimson editor, is the author of three New York Times bestselling books and was a columnist and senior editor of Newsweek for 28 years. He is also an analyst and correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC.
Turning to the media, Alter argued that journalism has become too focused on validating prior beliefs, enforcing partisan polarization.
“The problem is that [journalism] doesn’t bother challenging your assumptions--we need to be testing our ideas and ourselves,” Alter said, echoing former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s sentiment that “everybody’s entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.”
Alter closed the event by extending personal advice to the students in the audience, encouraging them to find friends “out of your comfort zone” and to not “get too burrowed in your world.”
“You want to be gregarious enough so you come into contact with people that maybe aren’t so cool now, but will be 30 years from now,” Alter said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Housing Authority commissioners voted 3-1 Wednesday to ban smoking in all city-owned public housing, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from residents and other community members.
The ban, which follows in the footsteps of a similar 2011 Boston Housing Authority decision, was first presented to commissioners this past May as part of the Housing Authority’s Healthy Air Initiative, aimed at improving public health.
Under the ban, tenants who wish to smoke must move to designated areas located at least 25 feet away from building doors or windows. Tenants caught smoking repeatedly after the enactment date of Aug. 1, 2014 can be subject to warnings or even legal action.
Opponents of the smoking ban say it is unfair to tenants and infringes on their privacy. One of these opponents, Stephen Helfer, a retired employee of the Harvard Law School library and a smokers’ rights advocate who is not a Housing Authority tenant, expressed concern about the ban’s impact on senior and disabled residents.
“The ban would require elderly and disabled people, some of them who have been smoking more than 50 years, to go out even at night or in the snow to have a cigarette,” Helfer said in a phone interview Thursday evening. He added that he believes issues like these are “more about social control than are protecting the health of the public.”
Another opponent, Paul Neff, a Cantabrigian who does not live in Cambridge Housing Authority public housing, claimed that the ban’s supporters are “attacking something that has been a human tradition for god knows how long.”
Prior to Wednesday’s meeting, Helfer and other opponents submitted a petition protesting the ban that has garnered almost 800 signatures from city residents, according to Helfer.
Despite this opposition, a survey conducted by the Cambridge Housing Authority in January 2013 found that a significant majority of Housing Authority residents actually approve of such a ban. Among the 538 responses to the survey, 77 percent endorsed smoking bans both inside and outside, while nearly 80 percent said they wanted to live in a smoke-free environment.
The same survey recorded comments from Housing Authority tenants. Referring to the dangers of secondhand smoke, one smoking-ban advocate who responded to the survey wrote, “I would hope to die from natural causes, not from the negligence of someone who didn’t care.”
The approved ban proposal originated primarily from health concerns related to secondhand smoke. According to a recent National Cancer Institute study cited in a report on the survey results, non-smokers who live in Cambridge public housing are exposed to daily secondhand smoke intake equivalent to smoking between one quarter of a cigarette and a full cigarette.
The Housing Authority also held a 60-day public comment period on the ban proposal, during which multiple hearings at the Housing Authority’s largest housing developments took place. Helfer said that about 80 percent of residents who spoke at these hearings “strongly” opposed the ban.
Though Neff said he “wasn’t surprised” by the Housing Authority’s decision Wednesday, both Neff and Helfer said that they plan to continue fighting the issue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Uncertainty abounds when it comes to the 2013 Harvard football team.
The loss of key players such as NFL draft pick Kyle Juszczyk ’13, a running back whom Crimson coach Tim Murphy called “one of the best to come through Harvard” in Treavor Scales ’13, and pass rush specialist John Lyon ’12 has left gaping holes for the team to fill.
But perhaps there lies no bigger—or more pressing—question mark than at quarterback.
For the first time since 2009, Harvard is starting a quarterback who has never taken the first snap in a game. That task falls on the shoulders of junior Conner Hempel, who recently earned the starting position after battling with senior Michael Pruneau throughout the preseason.
“During camp, [Conner] and Mike were competing every day, and the two of them just got so much better during the competition, and our offense really improved because of that,” said senior tight end Cameron Brate. “Every day, they really had to bring it—they were fighting for their lives during camp. But we see it every day during practice. [Hempel] has all of the tools to be a great quarterback.”
Last season Hempel moved up to the number two slot on the depth chart when Pruneau sat out the entire season with a torn ACL. Hempel saw action in three regular season games and started the spring game, earning valuable experience in the current system.
“The bottom line is, ultimately, you make a combination of analytical and gut decisions,” Murphy said, before naming the starter. “Neither guy has really done anything that says they’re really the guy, so you just have to keep evaluating.”
Following last Saturday’s game at San Diego, Murphy should be pretty pleased with his decision.
It would be reasonable to think that, in addition to starting his first collegiate game, Hempel would be daunted by the added pressure of filling the shoes of Colton Chapple ’13, the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year and the leader of the highest-scoring offense in program history.
Despite playing just the first half in some of Harvard’s games last year, Chapple set multiple school records in his final season as signal-caller, shattering the mark for most passing touchdowns in a season with 24 scores while amassing over 3,000 yards of offense.
But none of this seemed to faze Hempel, who made his case for the job in his first career start, connecting with seven different receivers for 345 yards through the air and four scores. The junior would have tied the Harvard record of five touchdowns had junior wide receiver Seitu Smith not fumbled the ball out of the end zone early in the third quarter.
The Union, Ky., native looked like a veteran on Saturday, remaining poised even after being forced out of the pocket to make passes down the field or scramble away from defenders to elude sacks even when pass protection broke down.
“It’s great, especially from a receivers[’s] standpoint, having such a versatile quarterback who can keep the play alive and get the ball down the field,” sophomore wideout Andrew Fischer said.
Aside from living up to Harvard’s recent success under center, Hempel, who was named Ivy League Co-Offensive Player of the Week, will be asked to compete with an experienced group of starting quarterbacks in the conference.
Cornell’s Jeff Mathews, entering his fourth year as a starter, is the only quarterback from the Football Championship Subdivision on the 2013 Johnny Unitas Golden Award watch list, an honor previously bestowed on NFL standouts Andrew Luck and Eli Manning.
Defending Ancient Eight champion Penn returns fifth-year senior Billy Ragone, who rallied the Quakers past the Crimson last year to upset the favorites and clinch the title. Brown, Harvard’s first Ivy League test, also brings back a three-year starter in fifth-year senior Patrick Donnelly, who led the Bears to a 45-7 obliteration of Georgetown in their season opener.
Princeton, which dealt the Crimson its only other 2012 loss, brings back signal-callers Connor Michelsen and Quinn Epperly, both of whom were instrumental in the Tigers’ late-game heroics to pull off a comeback win over Harvard last season.
Dartmouth boasts the 2012 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Dalyn Williams, while even the typical underdogs of the Ancient Eight—Yale and Columbia—have quarterback transfers from Clemson and Stanford, respectively, vying for the starting spot.
“There’s nothing we can do about the other guys, but there’s no question that this is going to be a very unusual and challenging year for defenses in our league,” Murphy said. “It’s going to automatically give those teams some credibility and production, and some swag, some confidence.... I don’t think we’ll face an average quarterback all year.”
But for Hempel, his relative inexperience compared to some of the other play-callers in the league is, if anything, just a motivating factor as the season progresses.
“I can’t really tell yet [how I’ll stack up in the league],” Hempel said. “It’s only been game one against a non-Ivy League opponent. That being said, San Diego was a great team; I definitely think I have the potential to compete with the top quarterbacks in the league. I’m just going to try to continue to get better and better every day, and I think that’ll come as the season goes on.”
And perhaps, while Hempel attempts to carry on the legacy of quarterback at Harvard, it’ll be the words of his former roommate, Chapple, that motivate him most.
“Colton texted me before the [San Diego] game wishing me luck, and I told him how thankful I was for his support for the past couple of years,” Hempel said. “I told him how I wanted to follow in his footsteps, and he told me that he wants to see me make my own footsteps.”
With the entire Ivy League season ahead of him and fueled by redemption after watching the Ancient Eight title slip away last year, Hempel should have plenty of time to make those footsteps and, if all goes well, leave his own mark on Harvard football history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior defensive end Zach Hodges sits on the stairs outside the Harvard football facility. A few steps below him, senior Nnamdi Obukwelu and his brother, junior Obum, plop themselves down, flanking Hodges on either side.
Finished with their work in the trenches for the day, the three defensive linemen finally unwind their wrist tape and loosen their pads.
Most of the glory typically goes to offensive players. But in the face of key losses from Harvard’s record setting offense last season, the performance of these three linemen may be critical to Harvard’s success.
“In some big games last year we didn’t really finish the games that we should have,” senior tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu said. “So finishing each rep, each sprint, finishing each day fast and strong was one big thing we worked on this offseason.”
The Crimson defense, susceptible at times last year to the big play, will be increasingly relied upon throughout its conference schedule. And much of that burden will rest up front with the defensive line—and especially with Hodges.
After a breakout year in which he amassed 32 tackles, nine sacks, and first-team All-Ivy honors, the junior will look to build on that success.
“He’s stronger, he’s more fit physically, he’s better technically, and he clearly will be a guy where everybody has to know exactly where he is on the field if you’re on offense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Part of it is he’s so lightning quick that he can expose you real quick, and he can run things down.”
And Hodges contributes to the defensive effort just by being on the field. Even if he is not pressuring the quarterback or making a tackle, offensive lines have to devote significant attention to Hodges’ side of the field, freeing up other defenders to make a play on the ball.
To Hodges’ right will be defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu, a veteran who has the ability to clog up much of the line of scrimmage. Obukwelu finished seventh on the team with 37 tackles last season, and he will likely take on an expanded role in his final year.
A potential difference maker not only on the line—but also for the defense as a whole—will be Obum Obukwelu. Although he has not had as much experience as Hodges or his older brother, at 6’2”, 275 pounds Obukwelu has the physical form to torment an opposing team’s front five.
“[Obum] has the ability to be a dominant defensive tackle at this level,” Murphy said. “He’s worked tremendously to get there, and I think this will be a big year for him to figure out if he’ll be that part of the equation.”
The two Obukwelus will not line up next to each other every snap, but when they do, their combined force could create trouble for an opponent’s blocking scheme. According to Murphy, there’s no reason both tackles can’t play at an All-Ivy level this season.
Much of Nnamdi and Obum’s time on the football field has been spent with the other. Hailing from nearby Brockton, Mass., the brothers attended high school together, both served as captain, and both made the decision to play at Harvard.
“[Obum] is a very gifted athlete,” Nnamdi Obukwelu said. “It’s been fun…and it’s been a once-in-a-lifetime experience, getting to play with your brother day in and day out, going through the aches and pains together.”
Along with familiarity, the defensive line also boasts experience, as nearly the entire front has seen big minutes in the past and is familiar with the daily grind of the Ivy League season.
Those extra reps paid off before the season even started. Because of the core group’s familiarity with the system in place, coaches have the capacity to expand the number of packages to throw at an opponent in a given game. Although the defense is based in a 4-3 set, the Crimson plans to showcase a 3-4 as well as a variety of blitz packages, including zone reads and drops into coverage.
“When you have an experienced line, there are a lot of things you can do,” Obum Obukwelu said.
One big loss for the Crimson will be that of defensive end John Lyon ’12, who graduated last year. Lyon performed consistently on the right side and racked up second team All-Ivy honors. Murphy hopes that guys like seniors Jack Dittmer, Austin Taylor, Luke Zelon, and Danny Frate, along with sophomore Dan Moody, can step up to help fill his shoes in a variety of defensive rotations.
“I think our depth is less [than last year], at least our proven depth, at defensive line,” Murphy said. “I don’t think we’re going to have the luxury of some of the quality of third-teamers that were playing.”
But anchored by the line, the Harvard defense certainly showed up to play in the first game of the year against San Diego. Hodges recovered two fumbles, returning one all the way back for the first score of the game. Dittmer assisted on a sack. And the Crimson surrendered only 97 net rushing yards, holding Toreros quarterback Mason Mills to a single touchdown pass.
“It doesn’t matter when you touch the field,” Hodges said. “But when you do, be ready to do your role and play your part.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been 15 years since the Brown football team has come away from Harvard Stadium with a win, and this weekend, it will get a chance to break that streak.
On Saturday night, the Crimson (1-0) will welcome the Bears (1-0) to Cambridge for both teams’ Ivy League openers. The game is the first of the season with implications for the Ancient Eight title race, in which both Harvard and Brown—ranked second and third, respectively, in the preseason Ivy poll—will be strong contenders.
“Every game is huge in the Ivy League,” said senior tight end Cameron Brate. “A loss in the first Ivy League game can really put you back in the Ivy League, so we really have to show up on Saturday night and bring our ‘A’ game, and we’re definitely rising to the opportunity.”
Questions plaguing Harvard in the preseason seem to be somewhat answered following a commanding victory over San Diego last weekend in the season opener. Junior Conner Hempel proved that he could hold his own as a leader in the offense, racking up 383 offensive yards and four scores in his first game as the starting quarterback.
Despite a preseason competition that saw the junior competing with senior Michael Pruneau for the starting job, Hempel was able to establish a rhythm with his wideouts, finding seven different receivers for double-digit yardage on Saturday.
“He’s been here the past two summers, and the summers are really important for us,” Brate said. “The receivers and quarterbacks do a lot during the summer, so getting all of those reps with Conner the past couple of years has really helped. Although it’s his first year starting, we’ve gotten a ton of reps over the past couple of years.”
But even with excellent protection by the offensive line on Saturday, the Crimson struggled to get anything going on the ground, with its two first-team running backs—sophomores Paul Stanton Jr. and Zach Boden—combining for less than 100 yards.
“We have to be a balanced team to reach our goals,” coach Tim Murphy said. “We don’t want to be a pass-happy team, we want to be a balanced team. [Against San Diego] we were getting some not-so-great looks to run the ball and some great looks to throw the ball, so we take what people give us. But at the end of the day, we want to be a balanced team that can win on cold, windy, rainy, or snowy day.”
Facing a Browns defense that held Georgetown scoreless until the last 30 seconds of the game, the backfield will need to create more plays to open the field up for Hempel.
“I don’t think it’ll be a super high scoring game because both teams are known for playing strong defense,” Murphy said. “Their first defense didn’t give up a single point last week against a Georgetown team that scored 50 against Davidson, so right now their defense on film looks unbelievable.”
Although the Harvard defense produced a fumble return for a touchdown to put the Crimson on the scoreboard first and a late interception to seal the San Diego game, it also struggled with stopping short gains on long drives. This allowed Toreros quarterback Mason Mills to tally nearly 300 yards passing and dominate the time of possession battle, tiring the defense and giving the offense only 16 plays before halftime.
Against veteran Browns quarterback Patrick Donnelly, who led his team to a 45-7 demolition of the Hoyas, Harvard will look to create more pressure than it did on Mills to give Hempel and company more chances to get onto the scoreboard.
“The bottom line is, we have to play more consistent football, we have to play more balanced football,” Murphy said. “We can’t let people dominate the clock and keep our offense off the field because with our type of offense, we have a relatively lot of quick-scoring strikes, a little bit like Oregon, so we need to have the ball more.”
Playing under the familiar lights of Harvard Stadium should give the Crimson some confidence—the team has not lost at home since October of 2010. But against one of the better teams in a competitive league, Hempel knows that a surging Brown team can be dangerous.
“Coach Murphy said that the Ivy League is stacked this year, and I don’t think there are any weak links,” Hempel said. “There’s no game that we can or should take lightly. It’s honestly a toss up in the Ivy League—it’s going to come down to who finishes in the end.”

An earlier version of this article misstated the team that Brown football defeated by a score of 45-7 last weekend. In fact, the Bears beat Georgetown, not Georgia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With last week’s match against UMass Lowell, the Crimson posted its most powerful offensive performance in almost a decade. Harvard looks to continue its momentum against Penn on Friday night.
Despite outplaying its opponents, the Crimson dropped three closely contested matches to start the season.  The losses came against Cal, San Francisco and University of New Hampshire.
Harvard turned things around with a tie against Providence followed by three consecutive wins against LIU Brooklyn, Rhode Island, and UMass Lowell.  The Crimson was strong on both ends of the field, outscoring its opponents 8-0.
“In general, we are learning to put together the pieces that everyone brings to the team,” captain Peyton Johnson said.  “We are more dangerous on the attack, and our defense has come together to be very solid these last two games.”
The Crimson turned it around in its last two games. After getting on the scoreboard three times in four matches,  Harvard matched its season’s total against Rhode Island before posting its five-goal performance.
“We’re pretty excited about it.”  said sophomore midfielder Brooke Dickens. “Our team dynamic is definitely improving.”
The Crimson’s past few victories have provided a strong improvement in Harvard’s morale. The squad hopes to translate this into success on the field tonight.
“Winning in such a commanding fashion has been a huge boost for our confidence,” said Johnson. “We’ve really been able to break it down and learn from the things that went right.”
Seven different players scored in the Crimson’s last three games. Junior defender Marie Margolius,  junior midfielder Laura Aguilar, freshman forward Joan Fleischman, sophomore forward Lauren Varela, freshman forward Karly Zlatic,  and senior midfielder Kristina Giraldo have each scored while newcomer Midge Purce has netted a team-high four goals.
“We’re confident in all of our players, and we’re truly excited,” said Head Coach Ray Leone. “Everyone is capable of playing the game, and they all have.”
The level of performance has inspired a degree of confidence amongst the group.
“It’s great to have a team where you can trust every single girl to do a great job on the field,” Dickens said.
Harvard is looking to continue its winning streak against Penn in its first Ivy League contest.
“This is always one of the most exciting games of the year for us,” said Johnson.  “Ivy League season is what we look forward to the most. We all know that we need to step our intensity up a notch.”
The Quakers (4-0-2) head into this match undefeated.  Penn is led by Tahirih Nesmith and Kerry Scalora, who have posted a team high of three goals each, and will be Harvard’s greatest threats going into the face off.  On the defensive end, the Quakers have only let in two goals this entire season.
“They are organized, experienced, and a very tough team,” Leone said. “We have a lot of respect for them... It’s going to be quite a challenge.”
While recognizing that Penn will be a formidable opponent, the Crimson remains confident.
“Every Ivy league game is a battle,” Dickens said. “Looking at Penn we have to realize that they’re a good team, but we can play with them and hopefully come out on top.”
With this in mind, Harvard is eager to get on the field against Penn. The squad plans to continue implementing the strong offense that has emerged in the past three games and hopes to start the run for the Ivy League title on a positive note.
“Our goals are always the same,” Leone said. “We want to be in the hunt for the Ivy League race...and it all starts Friday night."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football coach Tim Murphy takes a breath. He has the 2013 roster in his lap, but he’s not thinking about that now.
In front of him are a few of his favorite pictures and six Ivy League championship rings. The rest of his office is filled with other awards and mementos accumulated over his 20 years at Harvard. Behind him, on top of his bookshelf stuffed with game notes and playbooks, are a few Coach of the Year Awards and an American Flag presented to him on a USO trip.
But Murphy’s not talking about any of that either. He is trying to think about the hiring process that brought him to Cambridge 20 years ago.
“Oh my god, that seems so long ago,” Murphy said.
After taking a second, Murphy begins reflecting on two decades in an office he’d never thought he’d stay in for this long—the games, seasons, and players that have made it all so memorable.
 ‘TURNING POINT’
All six of Murphy’s Ivy championship rings sit on a table, neatly spaced, each glimmering in the box they likely came in. But one is special to Murphy—his first.
“I think your first always sticks out,” Murphy said. “That was the turning point of our program.”
In his first three seasons at Harvard, Murphy amassed a 10-20 record. But he could tell he had an improved team in 1997. It was his first Harvard roster composed entirely of players he recruited, and it showed.
The 1997 team took Columbia apart in a 45-7 week one victory. It demolished Holy Cross, 52-14. In conference play, the Crimson beat Cornell for the first time in 11 years. Harvard was still undefeated in Ivy play eight weeks into the season.
But Murphy knew none of that mattered, not if he couldn’t beat Penn. The moment he had set foot on campus years earlier, Murphy had set his sights on the Quakers.
“We knew coming in, when Harvard was way down,” Murphy said, “if we are going to win, we are going to have to go through Philadelphia.”
Murphy was unable to top Penn in his first three seasons. His worst defeat to the Quakers came in a 33-0 trouncing his first year.
The Crimson finally returned the favor in 1997, winning by the same score, 33-0.
“It was as thorough a domination as I’ve been involved in,” said Penn coach Al Bagnoli after the game.
The temperature never escaped the 30’s on that November Saturday, but Murphy probably didn’t mind the icy Gatorade shower he received at the end of the contest as he celebrated his first Ivy title.
“Nothing will ever be this special,” Murphy said that day.
Over 15 years later, a picture of his first recruiting class still sits in his office.
Since 1997, every recruiting class has won an Ivy championship at some point during its four years. Murphy has rebounded from his slow start and is now the winningest coach in Harvard history. But Penn still has his number.
The Quakers are the only Ivy squad that boasts a winning record against Murphy. Bagnoli, who started at Penn two years before Murphy arrived at Harvard, has nine Ivy rings in his office, three more than Murphy. The Crimson has come in second to the Quakers nearly as many times (five) as it’s won an Ivy title (six) under Murphy.
All that said, Murphy insists he wouldn’t trade a single victory over Yale for one against Penn.
UNDEFEATED, AND THEN WHAT?
Among the trophies that fill Murphy’s office is the Division I-AA Coach of the Year award he won in 2004 after leading the Crimson to its best record in over a century.
“To be honest, what I remember is that that was the most dominant team we’ve had,” Murphy said. “2004 was just the perfect storm: number one by far in special teams, offense, and defense. That was a team I thought was as good as anybody in the FCS in the country, and humbly so. That was a great football team.”
That year, Harvard went 10-0 for the first time since 1901, before Harvard Stadium had been built or the forward pass had been introduced. But it wasn’t easy.
The Crimson faced a 21-0 deficit hardly 10 minutes into its game against Brown in the second week of the year. But Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 led a comeback, and Harvard pulled out a 35-34 victory.
Against Dartmouth, it was the defense that triumphed on the final possession to secure a 13-12 victory.
That team included some of Murphy’s first nationally recruited players. In addition to Fitzpatrick, running back Clifton Dawson ’07 and defensive lineman Desmond Bryant ’09 both had opportunities to go to major BCS programs but opted for the Crimson instead. All three ended up playing in the NFL.
After the 2004 season, Murphy also had an opportunity to move up. Indiana University was looking for a new football coach, and they were interested in the recently named Division 1-AA Coach of the Year.
Murphy considered the offer but ultimately removed himself from the running, just as he had done after being mentioned as a candidate for other jobs.
When Murphy came to Cambridge, his mission was simple.
“My goals here are to help improve the program—to bring it back to a point first of being more competitive in the league, to be a winning program in the league, then ultimately to win the Ivy League championship,” Murphy said in 1993.
By 2004, he had accomplished all of that several times over. But the program had become Murphy’s child, Fitzpatrick said, and he wasn’t done raising it.
“When he came here, he had a vision, and there’s still a lot he wants to get done that he hasn’t done yet,” Fitzpatrick said after the 2004 season.
‘SMELL THE ROSES’
It takes Murphy a second to recognize all of the trophies that sit behind his desk. He doesn’t look back there often and admits he doesn’t think too much about all of his accomplishments.
“Whether we like it or not we all tend to...breeze by the successes and linger on the failures,” Murphy said.
Former Harvard assistant coach Ron Crook remembers how quickly the coaching staff moved past its 2007 Ivy championship.
After Harvard clinched the title against Yale, the coaches celebrated on the sideline. But they didn’t let the players enjoy the moment for too long. Crook and the coaching staff stressed what the team could take away from that year in order to win its next game nine months later.
“I think that’s the biggest thing you spend the time on,” Crook said. “Showing them what it takes to do that again.”
These days, Murphy recognizes the importance of enjoying the moment. But it is still easier said than done for the coach.
“It’s terrible but really good coaches, it takes them too long to realize you’ve got to smell the roses, and I certainly have to remind myself of that,” Murphy said. “It’s something you certainly have to somehow come to grips with, and I’m not quite there yet.”
Talking about the 1997 season, the game Murphy harps on first is the team’s only loss, a 24-20 come-from-behind win by Bucknell.
“What bugs me is...that’s what kept us from being a 10-0 team,” Murphy said.
“Unfortunately, sometimes it’s the failures that are more vivid in your mind,” Murphy said. “Sometimes the lows are lower than the highs are high for a lot of successful people.”
At the same time that Murphy struggles to celebrate each big moment, they become harder to come by.
Winning makes winning more difficult, Murphy says.
“The problem now is that everybody thinks it’s easier now,” Murphy said. “It’s not. It makes it harder every year.”
‘MEANT TO BE’
One of the three pictures that sit behind Murphy’s championship rings is a signed photo of Isaiah Kacyvenski ’00 playing for the Seattle Seahawks.
Kacyvenski played a huge role in earning Murphy his first Ivy championship in 1997 and was the first Harvard player to start every game in his career. He set Crimson single-season and career records for tackles before becoming the highest draft pick in Harvard history in the 2000 NFL draft.
But Kacyvenski almost didn’t come to Harvard.
Murphy didn’t hear about the high school linebacker until late in the recruiting season. It only took a couple seconds of watching Kacyvenski on tape to realize he was worth meeting.
Murphy took a flight to Syracuse, N.Y.,  and then drove to Kacyvenski’s home. He knocked on the door and waited for several minutes.
No one came. Testing the doorknob, Murphy found it unlocked and stepped inside. It was so cold inside the home on that December day that Murphy could almost see his breath.
Soon, Kacyvenski appeared on the stairwell. The high schooler quickly apologized for not hearing Murphy’s knock and the two went to sit down. Murphy briefly mentioned that he generally talks with each recruit’s parents as well. He didn’t know much about Kacyvenski’s backstory.
“He said ‘Coach, you don’t know?’” Murphy remembered. “‘My mom was killed in a car wreck a couple weeks ago and I haven’t seen my dad in five years.’”
“At that point you stop being a coach and a recruiter and you become a parent,” Murphy said.
The two talked for hours, but Kacyvenski was still hesitant. Murphy remembers telling the recruit, “You are going to Harvard,” but Kacyvenski didn’t think he’d fit in with what he imagined the Harvard football team and student body were like.
He wouldn’t even commit to a tour when Murphy finally left.
The next day, Murphy got a call. Kacyvenski wanted to visit.
Sitting on a couch in Murphy’s office after seeing the campus and meeting the players, Kacyvenski admitted that the people were more “normal” than he expected.
“The rest,” Murphy said, “is history.”
Murphy said he has also enjoyed the people he’s worked with off the field. He has from the very beginning.
Two of the first Harvard people Murphy met were Harry Lewis ’68, who would become Dean of Harvard College, and Lewis’ wife.
The two dropped in on him in Ohio on what Murphy described as a scouting mission.
“They were people who clearly loved Harvard,” Murphy said. “Very principled, impressive people.”
At the time, Murphy’s colleagues at the University of Cincinnati thought he was insane to leave a program on the rise for an Ivy League job, and to take a paycut in the process.
“They thought I was crazy,” Murphy said. “They thought it was the end of my coaching career.”
In a way, it was.
“It was...looking back, a great decision,” Murphy said in 2010. “Somehow, some things are meant to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Work to win.
That’s the motto that senior linebacker Joshua Boyd has adopted during his career at Harvard. And that’s the motto with which he leads the Crimson as the 140th captain of the Harvard football team.
“[It’s] the whole idea of always working hard,” Boyd said. “Work to win and get better.”
The senior embodies this work ethic as he embarks on his fifth and final year with the Crimson. Boyd knows all too well the values of hard work and perseverance.
The Hyde Park, Mass., native was seeing playing time in his first year on the field when his promising freshman campaign was derailed by a broken fibula and tibia in just the third week of the season. After having surgery, Boyd was sidelined for almost the entirety of the year.
“When it happened, I was pretty down on myself,” Boyd said. “It definitely was a dark time, not feeling like I was completely a part of the team, being injured and not being able to practice.”
But the injury set the stage for what would be an exceptional career with the Crimson.
“You definitely have to look at the silver lining,” Boyd said. “[The injury] allowed me the opportunity to come back here for this season. And just going through those tough times, I think it definitely made me stronger.”
Boyd stormed back his sophomore year, appearing in all ten games on Harvard’s 2010 schedule and making a name for himself as one of the top linebackers on the roster.
The following year’s campaign was even better. During his junior season, Boyd racked up 64 tackles and garnered All-Ivy honorable mention honors while helping the Crimson to an Ancient Eight title.
“Every year I just try to build,” Boyd said. “Whether it’s by statistics, by leadership, or just doing the little things better. Whatever way I can better myself, and better the team more importantly, that’s my goal going into the year.”
In the 2012 campaign, Boyd notched a team-high 67 tackles on the season and earned first team All-Ivy and All-New England honors.
Having successfully petitioned for a medical hardship waiver, Boyd returns for one final semester of school and one last season with the Crimson.
Heading into this year, there was little doubt that Boyd, a preseason All-Ivy selection, would be a source of defensive strength for the Crimson. But this time around, Boyd looks to be as much a leader off the field as he as been on it. ­
“I’ve always tried to lead by example during my time here,” Boyd said. “It definitely gives you that extra push during workouts when you’re tired. You know you have to go that extra mile because everyone’s looking at you. As captain of the team, you have to hold everyone accountable and be the hardest working guy.”
Boyd is the third-straight linebacker and ninth-straight defensive player to be named the sole captain of the squad. Having such a close relationship with the captains that preceded him has helped Boyd find his leadership style and shape his role as leader of the team.
“All those [captains] had characteristics that coach Murphy looks for in team leaders and what our overall team identity has to be,” Boyd said. “To be that next guy in line following those guys, it’s just an unbelievable honor.”
“He’s always been a tough, really high-intensity, emotional leader,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of Boyd. “Sometimes [it’s] not comfortable for kids to hold their peers accountable and get after them a bit. He’s done a great job. He’s as good at it as anyone we’ve had in a long time.”
With only a handful more games left in his Harvard career, Boyd is ready to lead the Crimson on what he hopes will be a charge to the top of the Ivy League standings.
It’s a season the linebacker will look to savor, both on and off the field.
“You definitely don’t take things for granted as a fifth-year guy,” Boyd said. “Being that ‘old man’ gives you more appreciation for the program. You know this is truly it. There’s definitely that sense of urgency, that I have to get the most out of myself, my teammates, and put it all on the line for these next ten games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League offensive player of the year. A running back whose career rushing yards puts him at fourth in Harvard history. An All-Ivy tight end who ended up as an NFL draft pick. All gone.
“There’s no question it’s different,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said.
And it should be. Anytime you lose the three vital cogs of a record setting offense —namely quarterback Colton Chapple ’13, running back Treavor Scales ’13, and tight end Kyle Juszczyk—the following season will be one of change.
But the Harvard football team still has its gaze set firmly on success. Having fallen just short of an Ancient Eight title last season, old faces and new will try to accomplish what last year’s squad could not: winning another Ivy League title.
“We definitely have high expectations every year that I’ve been here,” captain Josh Boyd said. “We set the bar high. Our ultimate goal is to finish at the top this year. That’s our expectation, and we’re going to work for it.”
Last year, the Crimson only lost two games, one to Princeton and one to Penn. But those defeats were enough to be the difference between first place and second. This fall, the Tigers travel to Cambridge on Oct. 26 and the Quakers will come north for a rematch in the penultimate game of the season on Nov. 16.
“We’ve got to finish,” junior quarterback Conner Hempel said. “That’s been a big theme for us. [Princeton] was a tough game, but we learn a lot in those tough games. We definitely won’t make that mistake again this year.”
Much of the team’s fortune in those big matchups depends on the performance of Hempel, who was named starting quarterback before the season opener against San Diego.
Although the junior had never before started at the collegiate level, Hempel answered many questions against the Toreros, throwing for four touchdowns and 345 yards to lead the Crimson to a 42-20 victory.
Despite the losses on offense, Hempel still has a number of players to which he can turn when Harvard has the ball. Sophomore running backs Paul Stanton Jr. and Zach Boden could provide the Crimson with a reliable two-pronged attack out of the backfield, although they are relatively untested.
At wide receiver, junior Seitu Smith and sophomore Andrew Fischer both add dangerous speed and can attract the attention of a defense, opening up the field vertically. Such quickness could create ample opportunities for senior tight end Cam Brate and senior wideout Ricky Zorn to make plays over the middle.
The aerial attack certainly worked against San Diego as Hempel threw for four touchdowns.
“Even though we’ve lost some good skill guys, I’m very comfortable with the team we have,” Murphy said.
On the defensive side of the ball, Boyd stands out as the leader at linebacker. The 140th captain of the Harvard football team—and the third consecutive linebacker to be selected for the honor—Boyd has been credited with establishing a positive atmosphere in the wake of a disappointing finish last year and the development of a new team core this season.
“The biggest difference I think is Josh Boyd,” senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu said. “He’s very vocal, very blue collar, very hardworking and very humble. I think that’s one thing that’s very different about him.”
Anchoring the Crimson defense up front will be junior defensive end Zach Hodges, who is coming off of a first-team All-Ivy season in which he registered nine sacks. Hodges had a productive offseason and has shown no signs of slowing down, recovering two fumbles against San Diego and returning one for a touchdown.
Joining Hodges on the line are Nnamdi Obukwelu and his brother Obum, a junior, along with seniors Jack Dittmer and Austin Taylor. All of them have the ability to make stops at the line of scrimmage.
Harvard also returns a bevy of experienced players in the secondary, including senior D.J. Monroe and junior Norman Hayes. The two defensive backs combined for 20 tackles and an interception in the season opener.
“There’s no reason we shouldn’t have a tremendous secondary this year, because we’ve never had more leadership and we’ve never had more quality players competing for playing time,” Murphy said.
When it comes down to it, this season will be one of change. Although the Crimson has the potential for success on offense and defense, only time will tell if all the question marks will be replaced by check marks.
“It’s going to have to be a team effort,” Nnamdi Obukwelu said. “Coach Murphy has a great system in place…. The machine keeps running no matter who’s in the position to play in it.”
An Ivy League championship eluded last year’s squad, but a new conference season kicks off Saturday against Brown under the bright lights of Harvard Stadium. And there is little doubt the Crimson’s gaze is fixed solely on bringing the Ancient Eight title back to Cambridge.
“Every field is our field, plain and simple,” Hodges said. “Every stadium is our home turf. We adapt to wherever we go. We like it rowdy, we like it dirty, we like it tough. Nothing that comes easy is worth it. We want it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (6-4, 1-0 Ivy) dominated Dartmouth (7-5, 0-1 Ivy) in almost all facets of Friday’s match en route to a 3-0 sweep in the Ancient Eight opener for both teams.
 
The win, which occurred at home at the Malkin Athletic Center, came after a loss on Tuesday night to New Hampshire in the team’s final non-conference fixture of the season.
 
“Dartmouth is a very good team,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “They started off strong [but] I think we did a great job of preparing; the team did a nice job in practice. We really ran through how to defend against what they were going to bring out and also, offensively, where we could get some shots. I think the preparation is so important and after UNH they really came in in practice and worked hard to prepare for Dartmouth.”
 
The second set, which finished with a final score of 25-21, proved to be the tightest frame of the day, as it was bookended by decisive Crimson victories.
 
But a tense moment occurred at the opening of the match, when the Big Green jumped out to an early 11-7 lead.  Key kills by sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Shults and stellar serving by junior co-captain Kristen Casey allowed Harvard to fight back to take the lead, 13-12. Another 7-2 run gave the Crimson control of the set.
 
In the final stanza, the Crimson continued its dominance over Dartmouth, exploding to an early 8-2 lead and never looking back. With the completion of that frame, Harvard sealed its sixth victory of the season.
 
“I think we’re a uniquely close team, both on and off the court,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “I think being one of the smaller teams at Harvard... we just know each other so well, and we know each other’s tendencies, and we know what each other need emotionally; that allows us to come together.”
 
The Crimson came out with a balanced attack, with the same nine players making appearances in all three sets.
 
The team’s offensive front was led by sophomore Kathleen Wallace who had a team-high 10 kills, freshman Grace Weghorst with nine kills and two aces, and sophomore Caroline Holte who matched Weghorst’s nine kills.
 
This trio was aided by the play of both of the team’s setters as freshman Corinne Bain finished with 26 assists and partner sophomore Hannah Schmidt tallied 13 of her own.
 
Harvard’s defense also put up a strong showing, as Doyle had 16 digs, Bain had 14 digs, and Holte and Weghorst chipped in three blocks apiece.
 
The Big Green lacked  a cohesive attack, with only one player, freshman Emily Astarita, registering more than five kills. Astarita had roughly one third of her team’s total points with 10 kills on the night.
 
Junior Holly Harper paved the way on defense with 10 digs of her own, followed by 7 digs by both Astarita and Freshman Molly Kornfeind.
 
In addition to the lack of an attack that could overcome Harvard’s defense, Dartmouth also faltered due to a number of unforced errors. They committed a total of 16 errors in the three sets compared to Harvard’s 10. Many of these came at critical times, such as when the Big Green was attempting to mount a comeback or when it was beginning to go on a run.
 
Symbolic of the team’s youth, Weghorst and Bain, both freshmen, made huge contributions to the game.
 
“[Weghorst and Bain] are doing amazing”, Doyle said. “They’re playing all the way around. [Bain] is able to play front row, as a setter, and she’s getting some amazing kills. Same as [Weghorst], she just flies.”
 
The Crimson’s overall team effort was the most crucial aspect to the game. The contest was the second this season in which the squad has played just three sets. The other straight set contest was a home victory on Sept. 18 against UMass Lowell.
 “We played a lot of preseason matches that had a lot of ups and downs, which is where we learned to be consistent”, Doyle said. “We came out today and the first point of game one, last point of game three, we had the same energy and presence. We were just able to play consistently, and to all be on the same page, and to avoid the emotional ups and downs. “

Somewhere between laundry, classes, and mountains of reading, you still find time to watch "The Newsroom," "How I Met Your Mother," "Teen Mom," and "Game of Thrones." Ever wonder what your professor is doing besides assigning you as much reading as possible? Flyby has the scoop on your professor’s other life.
 
SLS20: Professor Daniel T. Gilbert
Besides replenishing his stock of Sobe Lifewater/Vitamin Water, Professor Gilbert enjoys "Breaking Bad," "Homeland," "Boardwalk Empire," "Under the Dome," "Low Winter Sun," "Mad Men," "Veep," "House of Cards," and "Orange is the New Black," he told The Crimson in an email. How does one man follow so many TV shows and still maintain such a well-groomed beard? The world may never know. (Side note: Some say Gilbert has a surprising resemblance to Walter White…)
 
Ec 10: Professor N. Gregory Mankiw
Professor Mankiw cannot consume enough of "Breaking Bad," he wrote in an email. But there’s a limited supply of only five seasons—it’s like the government put a price ceiling on it. Mankiw better value every episode with the season finale coming up on September 29.  
 
LS1a/LS1b: Professor Robert A. Lue
“I am more of a movie person than a TV person,” Professor Lue wrote in an email. After causing hopeful pre-med students to have second thoughts on their life ambitions, Professor Lue recently watched "Moon" and "Europa Report," both films that Lue says “tackle provocative questions of what makes us human and unique in the universe (or not), and what personal sacrifices would we make to answer these questions.”
 SW 19: "Western Ascendency": Professor Niall Ferguson
Professor Ferguson never watches TV [gasp] and the last movie he saw was "Skyfall"—on an airplane. This world-renowned historian does catch up on his reading though. The latest book on his nightstand, he wrote in an email, is "A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers" by Xiaolu Guo. No, he is not looking for a rendezvous with a Chinese lover—the novel is about the struggles of an immigrant and her inability to communicate.
 
 
ER 22: "Justice": Professor Michael J. Sandel
Besides teaching thousands of people the basic concepts of human morality at Harvard and around the world, Professor Sandel finds time to binge-watch "Prisoners of War" on Hulu with his wife. “The characters are utterly compelling, and the story is full of suspense and political intrigue,” he wrote in an email.

Nowadays, the Harvard Class of 2017 Facebook page is just about as exciting as your dorm’s email list. Intramural soccer? Boring. Lost wallet? Boring. Prime minister of Norway coming to speak? Boring. But once upon a time, the page was full of posts revealing your classmates’ delightful combination of desperation, talent, and insecurity. Now that most of us have gotten the chance to reveal these qualities to one another in person, let’s relive some of the best types of prefrosh Facebook posts.
“Hey, does anyone know what the equation for oxygenated photosynthesis is?”Isn’t weird how Google suddenly stops working as soon as you’re accepted to college? Your acceptance email comes and then poof! All of a sudden, Google’s gone and you’re left to check your biology homework using ChaCha and a group of 2,112 strangers. Perhaps the CS50 students can do something to fix this.
“Is anyone else taking Ec 10?”Nope, no one. It’s just going to be you and Mankiw. So really, it’s just going to be you.
“I can’t decide between Harvard, Princeton, Amherst, Stanford, Dartmouth, Williams, Cornell, and Yale.”Let’s be honest. You already accepted Harvard’s offer of admission. In fact, you accepted immediately after you got the email. And come on, you really couldn’t decide between Harvard and Cornell?
“Remember when there were only like 300 people in this group. Lol.”Translation: I got in early action, and I want you to know it.
“I already really hate Yale”Okay, so you don’t really hate Yale. In fact, you actually had a really nice time at Bulldog Days. The Whiffenpoofs were great, and you’ve always dreamed of going to the Law School.
“Hey, if anyone is at the McDonald’s in Baudette, Minnesota right now, I’ll be here for the next 20 minutes and I’d love to meet up!”Have you never seen Dateline?
“What languages do you guys speak?”Translation: I speak fifteen.
<<Insert picture of girl in bikini on exotic vacation>>“Oops, accidentally posted this on the wrong page! ;)”This isn’t texting. You don’t just accidentally post things on the wrong Facebook page. And then never remove them.
“I feel like I already have 2,112 friends”Spoiler alert: you don’t.
“So what’s the lowest your GPA can drop without having your acceptance rescinded?”I don’t know, but I have a feeling Faust won’t be calling you about the 94.1% in your gym class.
“Did anyone else receive their placement test scores today?”Translation: Ask me what I got on my placement test.
“Does AT&T or Verizon work better in Boston?”This isn’t rural New Guinea. Get AT&T or Verizon or Virgin Mobile. Hell, get the Walmart Family Plan. I guarantee they’ll all send your “What did you get for number 4 on the physics p-set?” texts equally well.
“My great aunt’s bake shop is in the running for the best small town strudel in small town, rural Nebraska. It would mean SO MUCH to me if you’d vote for her.”Like the Gov 1310 scandal, this may or may not be construed as cheating.
“Hey guys! Last summer I started a non-profit social charity initiative in New York City. If you’re interested in tutoring disadvantaged children over Skype, let me know!”Translation: Hey guys, last summer I realized my grades weren't great, my dad’s donation wasn’t quite large enough, and going to concerts doesn’t count as an extracurricular activity. So my college admissions coach started a non-profit for me and now that I’ve been accepted, I’m totally in to helping others. Harvard students like that kind of thing, right?
  
“Hey guys, does anyone want to be friends?”Finally. No gimmicks. Just straight to the point.

This is Part II of Flyby's two-part Sober in the Square (and Beyond) mini-series. Check out Part I!
So, you want to get crazy on a Saturday night but you’d rather not wake up the next morning with beer all over your new dress and someone else’s underwear stuck to your shoe. All the events and activities on this list will ensure wild times, but no headache at practice the next morning.
1. Xmortis
10 Brookline St., Cambridge
If you shop at Hot Topic and write angsty poetry about how you’re so different from everyone else, you’ll fit right in at this old-school gothic dance club. You might have to get creative to conform to the dress code at Xmortis (the club’s website lists “batcaver,” “fetish,” and “Lolita” among its suggested styles), but two lauded DJs and an in-house band called Delilah Shameless ensure that you’ll be entertained through the night.
2. Doremi Karaoke
442 Cambridge St., Allston
Ask a Harvard student if he wants to sing karaoke, and he’ll obviously say “yes, but only if I can do it in thirteen different languages.” All possible at Doremi. This club provides private and party rooms for paying guests, each equipped with karaoke equipment, multilingual song books, a disco ball, and, rumor has it, tambourines.
3. The Donkey Show
2 Arrow St., Cambridge
Part disco dance party, part roller-skating derby, and part adaptation of Shakespeare’s "A Midsummer Night’s Dream." Don’t overthink it. It just works. The A.R.T. puts on this amazing show every Saturday at 10:30 p.m., so you really have no excuse not to go at least once.
4. Medieval Manor Theatre-Restaurant
246 E. Berkeley St., Boston
 This is hands-on experience, literally, because you’ll be eating your dinner of roast chicken, salad, and soup sans utensils. Though “wenches” serve beer and wine, non-drinkers enjoy free refills of “virgin mead.” As you devour your messy meal, jesters and other medieval-style actors provide live entertainment. Eat, drink, and be merry, but try not to shake hands with anyone.

This is Part I of Flyby’s two-part From Cali to Cambridge mini-series. Check back for Part II! 
 
The Harvard Class of 2017 hails from dozens of countries and 49 states (sorry, Wyoming). Faced with this bewildering geographical diversity, the untrained eye may find it difficult to classify freshman passerby into their places of origin. With a little practice and help from handy this Flyby field guide, you will soon be able to spot the Californicus studentus, one of Harvard’s more exotic species of students to migrate east this fall.
 
Whether they hail from Pasadena or Petaluma, California students tend to exhibit one or more of the following traits, making them identifiable to the attentive observer:
 
Strained Relationship with WeatherThe second thing people said to California students after learning of their Harvard acceptance—the first being “How did you get in there?”—was “Good luck with the weather.” In California, a magical place without seasons, one can reliably step outside to find the temperature between a cloudy 60°F or a toasty 90°F, in which case one can simply cool off with a trip to Water World. To a species that has never survived worse cold than a day’s skiing at Lake Tahoe, the anticipated chilliness of a Boston winter elicits two responses: desperation or denial. For many, any dip below 70°F is a catastrophic flux requiring the immediate recourse to a North Face jacket and Ugg boots. Those in denial may still be wearing Bermuda shorts and flip flops when December rolls around.
 
Inability to Pronounce Anglo-Saxon Place NamesAlthough the language barrier is by no means a localized difficulty, those from the West Coast have particular trouble with words containing excess consonants. Seventeenth-century Spanish missionaries left in California a legacy of easily-vocalized phonetics, where the biggest difficulty may lie in remembering to make a ‘j’ sound like and ‘h.’ Some examples: “San Diego” = “SAN dee-AY-go;” “Mendocino” = “men-doe-SEE-no.” New England names, with their inscrutably English spellings, pose special difficulty to even Harvard students (especially those who used Hooked on Phonics). For illustration: “Worcester” /= “WAR-chest-her;” “Greenough” /= “GREE-noff,” “Hingham” /= “hing-HAM.” Darn you, Puritans!
Tell-tale SlangUse of the word “hella” in any context is a sure sign you’ve spotted someone from California, and likely the San Francisco Bay Area, from which the term originates. Some sample phrases in the most common adjective/adverb usages: “The Moroccan carrot and raisin salad in the d-hall was hella sketch yesterday.” “I better pass this calc midterm; I studied hella for it.” Within the Golden State itself, the merits of “hella” are widely contested, contributing to a recent decrease in its usage. At Harvard, young males may wish to avoid the laughter elicited by misplaced “hella” (which does not fit the preppy East Coast stereotype), and thus it may be difficult to spot a Westerner from this word alone. Keep your ears open for “clutch,” “dank,” “gnar,” or “tight.” If all else fails, wait around next to the Sunday Sundaes table in Annenberg this weekend and listen for the first person to remark, “Oo, rainbow sprinkles!”. Be altruistic and let them know that here in Cambridge those colorful sugary pellets are actually called jimmies.
 
Slow Habituation to Clothing NormsIncoming Harvard freshmen from the Golden State probably spent their summer interning at a Silicon Valley startup fetching coffee for twenty-two year old computer science grads who are trying to launch the world’s next most relevant social media site ever. Startup—and even some corporate—culture in the West is characterized by tee-shirts, jeans, flip flops, and fantastic break rooms stocked with unlimited candy and Red Bull to keep coders happy, satisfied, and working at all times of the night. Institutions of education have similar presentability standards: California students will no doubt hear of from their friends at Stanford about how great it is to wake up and go to class in pajamas. As anyone who has been to Harvard’s campus will surely realize, bro tanks and sweatpants are unacceptable in dining halls, much less classrooms. Next time you spot one of these unfortunate but unintentional breaches of etiquette, be a good Samaritan and lend your Californian friend a nice blazer and pair of loafers.
 
With these tips in mind, spend a few hours lounging in the Science Center plaza with eyes and ears open and you are sure to identify a few new friends from the West Coast.
Step right up for this week's thrilling take on the terrifying tricks and stunning spectacles of college admissions news! We'll be back in town next Friday with even more.
SCARY SAT SCORES. No, I’m not talking about my math SAT II results. Average national SAT scores from this past school year were just released—and boy, is everybody depressed about them. More than half of high school seniors aren’t ready for college, and it’s been that way for five years. The Atlantic calls the lack of progress grim. The Washington Post’s blogger says SAT scores are “meaningless” and criticizes their use in college admissions decisions.
AIM HIGH. The College Board will send info packets on prestigious colleges, along with fee waivers for any six colleges of choice, to low-income high school seniors whose SAT scores are in the top 15 percent. Recent research showed that most of these kids don’t even apply to these top colleges, which typically offer the best financial aid packages.
OBAMA CARES? Over the summer, the White House announced a plan to rank the nation’s colleges and adjust students’ federal financial aid based on the rankings. (So, the worse your college is ranked, the less money the government gives you.) Cue screaming critics everywhere. Last week, Education Secretary Arne Duncan told people to cool it. Duncan also isn’t too concerned about getting perfect data, which might be a problem considering this latest instance of colleges fudging numbers...
ADMITTEDLY ACCESSIBLE. Remember when we on the Admissions News team pined for Google-for-college?  It may already be here. A new start-up meant to level the college admissions playing field launches today: admitted.ly. As Tech Crunch explains,  admitted.ly sticks with high schoolers from freshmen through senior  year and offers services like helping students choose viable college  options. Free now, pay (for some stuff) later.
11-YEAR OLDS, MEET COLLEGE. But actually. Three solid college admissions tips from U.S. News and World Report: start planning in middle school for high school math courses and college goals; consider financial aid options in deciding when to apply to college; and demonstrate your interest in a school to admissions officers (it’s important).
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT U For fretting college applicants of any gender, HerCampus warns of the hidden perils of college applications: forgetting to apply to safety schools, straining relationships with friends and family, neglecting senior grades. Warning: May only be suitable for overachieving children of over-involved parents.
“FREEBIES FOR THE RICH.” A New York Times economics reporter argues against universities giving merit money to wealthy kids with higher SAT scores, rather than providing financial aid to low-income kids. Merit aid may boost college rankings, but it doesn’t lower drop-out rates and can hurt a state’s economy in the long run. Ouch.
MERITS OF MERITOCRACY. If you’re wondering what merit even means, you’re not alone. Over at The Chronicle of Higher Education, high school guidance counselor James Jump ponders the distinction between merit and privilege.
TAKE THE PSAT. It matters! At least U.S. News and World Report thinks so. (Read especially if you have never heard of the PSAT. Hint: Not the SAT.)
COLLEGE-COUNSEL FOR AMERICA. The National Journal reports on a program that, like Teach for America with a twist, hires college grads to work as college admissions counselors in high schools with low university-attendance rates.
