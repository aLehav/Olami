After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mindfulness is biting into an apple without trying to read a book at the same time. It is taking deep breaths when sitting in traffic or waiting in an elevator. It is paying attention to what is happening now and not stressing about the future or worrying about the past.
At least, according to “Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life,” a new book published last week co-authored by Harvard nutritionist Lilian W. Cheung that combines Buddhist philosophy with healthy eating habits.
Cheung—a nutrition lecturer at the Harvard School of Public Health who studied under Buddhist Zen master and co-author Thich Nhat Hanh in 1997—suggests that a healthy lifestyle stems from healthy eating and a focus on reducing stress.
“Mindfulness is the underpinning of Buddhist teaching,” Cheung said. “And in Buddhism, the premise of life is suffering, but there is a way out of any suffering.”
Cheung details the mindful meditation method in the book’s second chapter, which takes the reader through an apple meditation exercise that involves carefully washing an apple, feeling it, focusing on its freshness, and breathing before taking the first bite.
The exercise results in a more conscious enjoyment of the apple, Cheung said, adding that its application to other activities leads to a more positive lifestyle.
“Our minds are racing constantly,” Cheung said. “We are not really fully into the food, being able to savor the food itself, [and] the art form of it.”
She later extends the apple meditation example to daily exercises in meditation—such as the brushing-teeth meditation, the traffic-jam meditation, or the light-switch meditation—emphasizing that meditation can be done at any time of day.
The book, which begins with a Buddhist’s perspective on weight control, is written in a language that is accessible to those who may not be familiar with the religion.
“Buddhism is not really a religion in the U.S.,” Cheung said. “Buddhism is a philosophy. Buddha basically means 'awake.' Anyone can start by being a part-time Buddha.”
The challenge to achieving mindfulness, Cheung said, is realizing that it is a habit that needs practice first.
“I hope [everyone] will find a little bit of time to practice,” Cheung said, “because it will help everyone juggle the many things in their lives, and they will feel much less stressed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOONE, N.C.—The Harvard men’s basketball team will remember Wednesday night’s matchup at Appalachian State for a long time—and for all the wrong reasons.
A 93-71 loss in the first round of the CollegeInsiders.com Tournament left the Crimson’s seniors with a disappointing conclusion to their collegiate careers, and its rookies with a sense of what postseason basketball so often entails for Ivy squads—games on the road against bigger and quicker teams.
Harvard managed to jump all over its hosts from the opening tip, using impressive defensive energy to force turnovers on each of Appalachian State’s first three offensive possessions.
But after surprising the Mountaineers by establishing a 30-18 lead in the game’s first 10 minutes, the Crimson’s energy dissipated, as did its 67-percent shooting from the field.
Following a layup by rookie Kyle Casey that gave Harvard an 11-point advantage—its final double-digit lead of the night—Appalachian State’s physical style of play began to takes its toll down low.
With over eight minutes to go in the frame, a missed shot in the post by forward Josh Hunter was tipped in by center Isaac Butts, whose body truly lived up to his name.
Collecting a team-high seven rebounds and eight points, the 6’10”, 285-lb Butts gave his defenders fits in the paint, as both Casey—who appeared worn down and missed eight of his 13 field goal attempts—and sophomore center Keith Wright had trouble dealing with him one-on-one.
Butts’ front-court teammates Hunter and Andre Williamson, who combined for 24 points and 11 rebounds, also bullied around the Crimson’s undersized forwards, out-leaping senior Pat Magnarelli and co-captain Doug Miller for boards, second-chance buckets, and the occasional block.
“I thought their front-line guys were just outstanding tonight versus our guys,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The points in the paint were…a tremendous advantage.”
After sophomore wing Max Kenyi threw up an air ball from behind the arc after Butts’ tip-in, the Crimson allowed two offensive rebounds on the same possession, finally leading to a three-pointer by guard Kellen Brand to cut the deficit to six.
Three minutes later, layups by Butts and Hunter helped their team close the half on a 13-0 run, punctuated by Hunter snatching the ball from Harvard’s Wright and eventually finding Williamson for a crowd-pleasing dunk.
And Hunter put his team ahead by six at the half with a one-handed put-back of a missed three as the buzzer sounded. The home squad outscored its opponents, 20-8, in the paint and 12-0 on second chance opportunities in the first half alone.
PERIMETER PROBLEMS
The matchup was not much better for Harvard in the backcourt, as Appalachian State’s guards relentlessly attacked the hoop, especially on fast breaks. Even after the Crimson’s made baskets, the Mountaineers pushed the tempo of the game, looking to catch defenders off guard.
And once in the half-court, Appalachian State was able to make Harvard pay with stellar outside shooting.
Shaking off an uncharacteristically slow start, guard Donald Sims—who leads his team in scoring with 20 points per game—knocked in six threes on the way to a team-high 22 points.
Combining for 24 points, teammates Brand and reserve Marcus Wright also did damage getting into the lane and showed off impressive midrange games, enabling the Mountaineers to pull away to a 16-point lead at the 11:24 mark.
With its big men clearly overmatched in the paint, Harvard’s headliners on the perimeter couldn’t bring their team all the way back.
Co-captain Jeremy Lin contributed a 12-point, seven-rebound effort, but the guard was never dominant in the final game of his Harvard career and went 0-for-3 from behind the arc—attempts that all missed badly.
“They were physical, and they were fast, and that’s not necessarily something that we’re used to,” Lin said. “They surprised us, and they played better than us.”
Freshman Brandyn Curry was 3-of-6 from the field, including a pair of three-pointers, but the lone bright spot for Harvard was the play of wing Christian Webster. The rookie led his team with a career-high of 24 points, including 6-of-6 from three-point range.
Most of his offensive barrage came in the first half as the Crimson established its lead. Webster spotted up and hit a trio of treys all from nearly the same spot deep in the left corner.
Later in the second half, Webster would find the mark again on a clean three from the left wing, putting Harvard back within single digits with just over 15 minutes to go.
But on the next possession, Butts would lay the ball in off an offensive rebound by Brand, and the Mountaineers would run away with the home win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Home was not so sweet for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team.
Despite a second-half rally, the Crimson (2-3, 0-1 Ivy) was unable to extricate itself from a 7-1 halftime deficit, as Harvard dropped its home opener to No. 11 Boston University (4-2), 13-9, on Wednesday.
After ratcheting up its defensive intensity and receiving offensive production from newcomers Jennifer VanderMeulen and Melanie Baskind, the Crimson was able to cut a seven-goal deficit to as little as three in just under nine minutes of play.
“I think we have a lot of fight in us,” freshman Danielle Tetreault said. “We knew that we weren’t playing up to our potential [in the first half].”
Baskind, a sophomore playing her first season of lacrosse, ignited Harvard’s offense, which had been held to just one score over the first 33 minutes of play. Baskind used a free-position shot to net the Crimson’s second goal, then notched her second score of the game two minutes later off a pass from freshman Micaela Cyr.
VanderMeulen got in on the action just minutes later, going unassisted for her second score of the game, closing the margin to 8-4.
“I kind of knew that our team needed some goals and that we were in a slump,” VanderMeulen said.
Baskind then found freshman Alexis Dal Col open for the score, making it four straight goals for Harvard.
Meanwhile, the Crimson clamped down defensively, keeping the Terriers off the scoreboard for nearly 10 minutes of play.
“Our defense had a great second half,” VanderMeulen said. “They weren’t willing to step down at all. They really got us going on our comeback.”
At least partly accounting for the defense’s second-half success was coach Lisa Miller’s decision to switch from zone to man-to-man defense, which allowed Harvard to apply greater pressure and to come away with interceptions.
“We went into man [defense] and tried to get them out of rhythm,” junior defender Sam McMahon said. “It’s all about pressure on the ball.”
The move was largely successful, as the defense forced BU to cough up the ball 11 times in the second half.
But the Crimson defense could not keep the Terriers off the scoreboard forever.
Less than a minute after Dal Col’s shot cut the BU lead to three, the Terriers responded with two quick scores, courtesy of Jenny Taft and McKinley Curro.
Co-captain Sara Flood got Harvard back within four, but a 10-minute scoring drought doomed the Crimson. VanderMeulen netted two scores in the game’s final five minutes, but it was too little too late.
“We were disappointed in the first half with our efforts,” McMahon said. “In the second half we just pulled together. We had more pride.”
The Terriers dominated the opening minutes, rattling off five-straight scores to start the contest. Behind Taft’s two first-half goals, BU led 7-1 at the break.
“They clearly were bigger and taller than us,” McMahon said. “They just go so hard. They just try to ram it down your throat.”
The Crimson was also sloppy controlling the ball in the early going, turning it over 13 times to open the game.
VanderMeulen netted Harvard’s only score of the opening frame, her first of four in the contest—a game high.
VanderMeulen did most of her scoring despite facing double-teams throughout the contest.
“[VanderMeulen] was getting swarmed,” McMahon said. “They had a marked defender on her.”
Double teams are something the high-scoring rookie will have to get used to following an injury to last season’s leading scorer, Jess Halpern.
“Now she’s kind of the one handling the ball the most,” McMahon said. “She’s definitely not playing like a freshman.”
But the Crimson knows that it will take consistent play from the game’s opening minutes—rather than the play of any one individual—to get on the right side of the win column.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In baseball, one bad inning is often enough to derail your chances in a game. This is all too clear for Harvard, which was 0-4 in the first contests of its weeklong road trip.
In all four games, one inning made all of the difference.
“We seem to play a good seven or eight innings during our game, but we always seem to have that one inning where we run into some troubles,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said.
One game featured a walk-off single in extra innings. In the others, Harvard allowed at least four runs—and as many as seven—in a single frame, and each time the crooked number was the clear difference.
“We had some tough losses, but we’re going to build upon them.  Right now, we’ve been hitting the ball well, scoring some runs, but haven’t really been finishing games,” said junior captain and catcher Tyler Albright.
With the losses, the team moves to 3-7 for the season going into its weekend series against Charlotte.
UNC GREENSBORO 12, HARVARD 7
For seven and a half innings, the second game against UNC Greensboro was a competitive, back-and-forth contest.
In the top of the seventh, the Crimson quickly scored two runs on an Albright double to tie the game, but could not score again in the inning despite a number of bases-loaded opportunities.
The Spartans capitalized on those same chances in the home half, and Harvard surrendered its second grand slam of the road trip.
“[It] should’ve been a pretty close game, 8-8 going into the late innings, [but] next thing you know it’s 12-6,” Walsh said.
Sophomore Jonah Klees, who pitched a perfect seventh inning in relief before allowing all six runs in the eighth, was charged with the loss—his first decision of the season.
Albright, batting in the seventh spot, led the Crimson offensively with three RBI on the evening. Sophomore Marcus Way hit his first career home run in the ninth inning.
UNC GREENSBORO 4, HARVARD 3 (10 innings)
After two blowouts to start Harvard’s road trip, the Crimson kept its first of two games against UNC Greensboro close, but still lost on a 10th inning RBI single for its third loss in as many games.
Harvard held a 3-1 lead after the third, but the Spartans tied the score at three in the bottom of the fifth. The score remained knotted there until the decisive tenth inning, when the Crimson could not stop Greensboro after a one-out double.
A ground ball single to Brent Suter gave the sophomore right fielder a chance for a play at the plate. Despite an accurate throw home, Albright—playing with a fractured thumb—could not hold on, dropping the ball and allowing Lloyd Enzor to score the winning run.
Both teams left 11 runners on base in the game, failing to capitalize on other scoring chances in the relatively low-scoring game. Harvard left runners on base in all but three innings, one of which was its one-two-three tenth.
“They had given us a couple of walks in an inning, and we just haven’t been getting teams that have been giving us any freebies,” Walsh said. “We were getting guys on but not delivering that key two-out hit.”
WINTHROP 12, HARVARD 5
Despite jumping out to a first inning 3-0 lead, the Crimson could not hold on against Winthrop, and the game quickly moved out of reach for Harvard in the seven-run loss.
Though the Crimson held a 5-3 lead after the top of the fifth, the Eagles put seven on the board in the home half of the inning, a lead which Winthrop maintained for the rest of the game. The Eagles batted around in the inning, which was fueled further by two Harvard errors.
Junior starter Zach Hofeld, who lasted four plus innings and allowed eight runs—seven earned—picked up the loss, his first decision of the year.
“We got behind on hitters, and they…took advantage of that,” Walsh said. “Other than that one bad inning, we played a pretty competitive game against them.”
Still, Harvard was not as contained as in its first game of the roadtrip. Crimson shortstop Sean O’Hara reached base in every plate appearance, going 2-for-2 with a run, an RBI, and two walks.
GARDNER-WEBB 9, HARVARD 0
Gardner-Webb pitcher Michael Hanzlik threw a one-hitter, and after the Crimson gave up four runs in the first two innings, the game was never close in Harvard’s first loss of the week.
The Crimson’s only hit was a second inning single from designated hitter Way, but the hit was erased by a 6-4-3 double play of the bat of the next hitter, senior Dan Zailskas.
Hanzlik was perfect from the second inning until the ninth, when he hit freshman pinch hitter Kyle Larrow with a pitch.
“He really just threw strikes,” Albright said. “I think he had a lot of us off-balance by throwing first-pitch curveballs or first-pitch fastballs and just kept us guessing the entire game…That guy was just on that day.”
The Crimson’s pitching could not match Hanzlik’s stellar performance, and the staff never seemed to find its rhythm. Rookie starting pitcher Andrew Ferreira gave up three runs, all earned, on four walks and two hits, and lasted only 1.1 innings.
The first relief pitcher of the afternoon, Matt Doyle, did not fare any better, giving up five runs in 3.2 innings of work. Runnin’ Bulldogs shortstop Aaron Miller delivered most of that damage, hitting a sixth-inning grand slam to move the game to 8-0. Miller led Gardner-Webb with six RBI on the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though a new year has begun for the Harvard women’s golf team, one thing remains the same—the squad’s ability to win.
Honing their games in the Sunshine State over spring break, the two-time defending Ivy League champions kicked off the 2010 season in sparkling fashion Thursday afternoon, taking down Central Florida, 303-314, at the Red Tail Golf Club in Sorrento, Fla.
The 11-stroke victory over the Golden Knights on one of their home courses—on which the Crimson was playing for the first time—marked the third straight win for Harvard, which had closed out its 2009 fall campaign with top finishes in both the Yale Fall Invitational and the Kelly Gutshall Invitational.
The steady play continued this week after a long winter of indoor training, as the top three finishers in the head-to-head friendly competition were all representatives from Harvard. Each team’s best four scores were counted.
“We’ve been putting in a lot of work, and it showed pretty well,” captain Claire Sheldon said. “Obviously we’ve still got some work to do, but it was definitely a good start to the season.”
Freshman Katie Sylvan led the way by shooting a 73, good for one-over-par on the 6,195-yard course. The rookie led all golfers with 15 pars and was one-under on par 3’s.
“[Sylvan] is just an incredibly talented player, and could easily be one of the best players to come through this league,” Sheldon said of the standout newcomer. “She’s naturally so skilled, and I’m not at all surprised that she came out of the gate as strongly as she did.”
“She can put up low numbers, and I’m not surprised by that,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads added. “She knows how to bring it when she needs to in a game-time situation.”
Crimson sophomores Christine Cho—the reigning league Rookie of the Year—and Jane Lee each finished three shots behind Sylvan to tie for second place, ahead of Golden Knight freshman Valentina Fontaine, who led her squad with a five-over 77.
“I played really well,” Lee said of playing outdoors for the first time since the fall. “I was really surprised, actually...I didn’t really know what it would be like being outside again, but to play well is definitely a confidence booster for the upcoming season.”
Thanks to an eagle, Lee was the only golfer under par on the par 5’s.
“The course was really hard, and it was much longer than we’re used to, so it was pretty tricky in some spots,” Lee said, “but I think everyone felt their game had improved since we’ve been here.”
Just behind Fontaine was Sheldon, who shot a 78 to tie for fifth, along with two members of Central Florida.
Following the eighth- and ninth-place finishers, both of whom were Golden Knights, freshman Chloe Altchek shot a nine-over 81, and junior Mia Kabasakalis and senior Sarah Harvey rounded out the day with an 88 and 90, respectively.
All six of Harvard’s players recorded birdies on the afternoon.
“I’m very pleased for this stage in the season to get a good result like we did yesterday,” Rhoads said. “To start fairly sharp is a good indicator. It’s encouraging, but it’s very much about where do we go from here, where do we go in the next five or six weeks.”
As is always the case, the Crimson’s top priority is improving its skills in preparation for Ivy competition. The team next plays at Lynn on March 27.
“We’ve talked a lot about being in your ideal performance phase,” Rhoads said. “Having an actual result is pretty far removed from the things that we can control. I’m really more looking at our controllable factors, and the results take care of themselves…the score just ends up being a byproduct of those things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To beat the best, you must play the best. Since California is the mecca for water polo, that’s exactly where the Harvard women’s water polo team traveled to compete against six of the West Coast’s best teams, including two ranked opponents, over spring break.
“Water polo is pretty stacked on the West Coast,” sophomore Devan Kennifer said. “That’s one reason we come out to California, to play against really good competition.”
The Crimson began the break with a 7-4 win over Fresno Pacific on Monday before falling later that day to UC Davis, 12-4. After another day of practice, Harvard faced No. 7 San Jose State on Wednesday, coming away with a 13-7 loss.
“There were a couple of games we could have easily lost, but we fought through and won, and there were also some games that we easily could have won and didn’t quite pull out,” Kennifer said. “There was a lot of learning, but there was also a lot of success and growth too.”
The biggest thrill though, was not the wins but rather California itself.
“We were just so excited to be in California. It took a little bit of adjustment to remember how to play in an outdoor pool,” Kennifer said. “The sun’s different, the wind’s different, but it was a great team atmosphere, since we were sucking up the Vitamin D, and we were so excited to be here.”
“It was a rejuvenating experience for us, and in terms of our record, we did a really great job,” classmate Monica Zdrojewski added.
NO. 7 SAN JOSE STATE 13, HARVARD 7
Wednesday’s game against its second top-10 opponent of the year started with Harvard grabbing a 2-0 lead. While the Crimson put another shot past Spartan goaltender Meagan Minson, San Jose State tallied four of its own, leading by one goal going into the second quarter.
While each team scored twice in the final quarter, the Spartans had put the game away in the third, outscoring Harvard by a 4-1 margin to add to its 7-4 halftime lead.
“That team is mostly the girls that I played last summer,” Kennifer said. “They knew exactly how I played, which was interesting, because they knew exactly how to shut me down. But again, we did some good things too, which is part of the learning experience.”
Kennifer scored three goals while four other Crimson players found the back of the net. Freshman Aisha Price recorded four steals while sophomore goalie Laurel McCarthy deflected three shots.
“Even when you are getting killed, keep fighting, trying things, get creative and try to execute with a really good team in your face,” Kennifer concluded.
NO. 15 UC DAVIS 12, HARVARD 4
Playing its second game of the day, Harvard was unable to score in the first half of Monday’s nightcap. As UC Davis attacked McCarthy and her defense, the tally for the Aggies continued to rise.
“It was our second game of the day, so we weren’t completely fresh,” Kennifer said. “It was interesting, because throughout the week, we were a lot more tired than we expected to be, and we were remembering how much the sun takes energy out of you.”
In the final 16 minutes, the Crimson began to step it up, as sophomore Ita Barton-Kettleborough scored twice while Kennifer and freshman Elise Molnar each put one in the net.
“That’s one of those games that if we played them 10 times, we aren’t going to beat them 10 times,” Kennifer said. “They probably aren’t going to beat us 10 times either, but they have a very strong team and a very strong program. We are playing up to them. We did some good things in that game, but not enough to shut them down and win.”
HARVARD 7, FRESNO PACIFIC 4
Harvard started its spring break on the upswing, beating its first opponent of the week, 7-4 on Monday. McCarthy and the defense stayed solid in the first three quarters as the Crimson grabbed a 6-1 lead going into the final eight minutes.
“We also had a really good defensive game against Fresno Pacific,” McCarthy said. “It was good to see the defense clicking there.”
Kennifer grabbed her first hat trick of the week while classmate Shannon Purcell scored twice. Price and junior Patty Smith each tallied one as well.
But the key to the low-scoring game relied heavily on Harvard’s defense.
“We’ve been trying to work on our defense, especially at the beginning of the game, because at the beginning of the season we weren’t starting as well as we could right from the first whistle,” Kennifer said.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient  Eight (and some other schools too).
After all the wonderful videos Yale made for us this year, will there ever be a DVD box set to archive these cinematic treasures for posterity? While we would certainly be willing to shell out whatever amount for such a timeless collection, we would hereby like to suggest yet another chapter to the saga, another item for inclusion in the series.
Just today, The New York Times “The Choice” blog ran a piece from a guest contributor—a Yale Class of 2014 admit. The kid, who stars in an accompanying video, writes about how Yale was his first choice, and, from his writing sample, we agree that it would probably be the best match for him. Describing the moment when he first learned of his admission, he writes, “Hugs abounded and fist pumps flowed like water; I felt the burden of my uncertainty float away.” Just look at those similes—and that smokin’ semicolon! Harold Bloom would be so proud…
Also, MGMT is coming to perform at Yale’s annual Spring Fling and Brown's Spring Weekend. (Brown, by the way, will also get Snoop Dogg.) Wonder who we'll get for Yardfest?
On a more alarming note, the price of birth control pills will more than double at Princeton after Mar. 31. The university health center currently charges $6 for both available brands—Lo-Ovral and Aviane—which will soon cost $14 and $17, respectively. According to The Daily Princetonian, the price increase is in reaction to the recent depletion of the temporary “discretionary funds that UHS has used to subsidize oral contraceptives for all students and their dependents.”
In light of the recent Texas school board vote that approved putting “a conservative stamp” on certain textbooks, Columbia Professor Eric Foner appeared on the Colbert Report last night to voice his disapproval about altering history.
Finally, Larry Summers spoke at Stanford last Friday night to offer his two cents on what needs to be done with financial regulation. Apparently, he voiced his support  for compensating taxpayers for the  part they played in the Wall Street bailout.
