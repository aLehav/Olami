After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Media commentators have once again renewed their focus on the tradition at schools such as Harvard of giving preference to students with a family connection to the institution. While it admits to the practice of slightly favoring “legacies,” Harvard has long argued that supporting the legacy tradition helps maintain an active alumni base and encourages donations. However, the administration needs to do more to back up its argument, and should launch a new study to reevaluate whether this practice actually benefits Harvard’s relationship with alumni. If such a study, hard as it may be to conduct, concludes that legacies offer no discernible benefit to the College, this preference ought to be eliminated.
Proponents of the legacy tradition argue, perhaps correctly, that this continuity helps bind alumni to the institution long after they have graduated and may be living across the world. A vibrant alumni network does help the institution in valuable ways—especially with recruiting new students—in addition to the benefits of graduates’ financial commitment to their alma mater. If giving alumni’s children a slight advantage in admissions helps keep this network attached and enthusiastic, then Harvard should maintain this approach. We believe that a study might point to whether such logic is, in fact, accurate.
Since Harvard does not judge applicants using a point system, we hope that such a study be conducted without depending on numerical methods. It remains very difficult to tell how much help legacy status actually affords, since children of alumni may also stand a better chance of getting into Harvard for reasons other than their legacy status.
Above all, Harvard should admit students based on academic merit and other forms of recognizable achievement. Since legacy status does not fit within either of those categories, it should not add to a student’s candidacy unless perpetuating this policy actually benefits the University as a whole. Such benefit can be defined beyond simple monetary measures. For instance, the presence of legacies in our academic environment may help the undergraduate body feel more connected with the history of Harvard, adding to the sense of community across generations.
Although we remain unsure whether providing legacy preference is actually worthwhile for the College, we do not agree with those who argue that it should be admissions offices’ job to equalize society. Instead, Harvard should create the academic environment it sees as best. That being said, we hope that the College reevaluates its stance toward admissions by studying the realities of legacy preference and acting accordingly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard campus today is a far cry from what it was 50 or even 20 years ago. With an increasingly diverse student body, a robust financial aid program, the withdrawal of official recognition for final clubs, and a randomized housing system, the College has taken numerous steps to stop privileging the rich and well-connected above other students.
A notable exception to the general trend is Harvard’s relative inertia with regard to giving legacy students preference during the admissions process. Providing an admissions boost to applicants who have a close relative who attended Harvard is, in effect, affirmative action for individuals who already enjoy many advantages—a practice that should be officially discontinued.
While Harvard has traditionally been reticent about the specifics that go into admissions decisions, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 stated in a 2003 Wall Street Journal article that legacy status is used as a “tie-breaker between comparable candidates” during the admissions process.
Displaying favoritism toward students because of their lineage rather than individual accomplishments or academic achievement runs contrary to the meritocratic values that the College ought to promote. Despite the diversification of Harvard’s alumni pool in recent years, legacy preference still overwhelmingly favors white applicants from wealthy backgrounds, whose relatives have historically enjoyed an edge in admission to the College.
Proponents of legacy admissions point to the utilitarian benefits of admitting the children of alumni. It is said that legacies are more likely to matriculate if accepted, thereby augmenting a school’s yield. Alumni are also thought to be more generous in donating their money, and perhaps their time, to their alma mater if they think those contributions will increase the chances of a son or daughter getting in.
These concerns largely ignore the preponderance of other factors that lead students to choose schools and alumni to give to them. Some students choose to attend Harvard because their parents went there, but many other students choose based on the College’s unrivaled financial aid package or because the Harvard name is attractive enough by itself. Likewise, alumni donate and involve themselves with their alma mater for a wide variety of reasons—perhaps because they believe in Harvard’s mission and core values or because their time at the College was a formative experience in their lives.
Harvard’s really big donors, the ones who underwrite research funds and other initiatives at the College, will likely continue to donate for philanthropic reasons, regardless of legacy preference. Alumni of all economic backgrounds should be encouraged to give back based on the principle of supporting an institution that generally enriches the lives of many students, rather than on the principle that there will be a direct payback for their contributions.
Even if Harvard stops giving legacy preference tomorrow, plenty of highly-qualified legacy applicants will continue to be admitted to the College. Being a child of a Harvard graduate already confers many advantages: The zip code one lives in, the type of school one attends, and the type of academic and college preparation enrichment that one has access to may all directly or indirectly relate to where one’s parents went to school. There is no need to confer an additional advantage to those whom the circumstances of birth have already endowed with plenty.

Maybe I’m too old—at the ripe ol’ age of twenty and too long out of high school—but I don’t recall any friends, acquaintances, or enemies with the ardent desire for blood. Apparently, times have changed, and this is today’s new trend. Teens in relationships have found a new medium for intimacy: drinking each others’ blood. What better way to promulgate the spread of disease—I mean, of love?
Inspired by popular culture like Stephanie Myers’ romanticized Twilight Saga and HBO’s graphic True Blood, the members of this subset of teens today bite each other, envisioning their human canines to be fangs, drawing blood and drinking the crimson fluid. Those involved in this phenomenon are adolescents likely struggling with acceptance, striving to find some semblance of community, as is the case with the students who were the subject of the vampire rumors that took hold of Boston Latin School in March 2009. Teens in relationships, seeking some deeper level of intimacy and connection according to Dr. Orly Avitzur, medical advisor to Consumers Union, are also active participants of this increasingly popular trend. One girl with the pseudonym, “GothicGirl10”—one of many teen-aged posters on vampire-related websites—even wrote, “Having that thick, warm copper-tasting blood in my mouth is the best thing I can think of!”
This is not only purely creepy, it is also highly concerning. Most urgently, this habit of drinking blood is dangerous on a medical level. Drinking blood causes foreign pathogens to flow freely into one’s own body, and this surely leads to a great health risk. Blood-borne diseases like HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis are no walk in the park, and neither are the slew of infections likely to arise from an open wound—10 to 15 percent of human bite wounds become infected, especially as the human mouth is one of the dirtiest.
Additionally, as Dr. Avitzur points out, these teens seem to be under the influence of a deep delusion; they seem to think they are real vampires. The rest of GothicGirl10’s comment goes, “Sometimes my boyfriend lets me feed off him. I let him feed off me as well.” In March 2009, several female students at Boston Latin School were said to be carrying umbrellas to avoid the sun. Other students were said to be draining their blood to appear paler in complexion. And still others were said to be biting students. This level of hysteria is worrying; what dangerous vampire-based trend is next? Drinking the blood of small animals to spare humans—vegetarianism as inspired by Twilight?
While commenting on the situation, Susanna Toomaijan, president of the Massachusetts School Psychologists Association, says it is likely that the problem at hand is one of acceptance. If acceptance, and even, a need for intimacy, is the cause of this blood-lust, something ought to be done to alleviate these teens’ negative feelings—of rejection or otherwise. True, it is an age-old quest, that of the youth seeking acceptance, especially in odd, unique ways, and perhaps we ought to let these teenagers pave their own paths. It is likely that most of these teens will eventually retreat from this craze and grow up to become normal adults who look upon their vampire days as an eccentric folly of their youths. However, because of the medical risk, this blood-sucking trend is no normal fad. When the stakes are so high, as they are with blood-borne pathogens, letting this blood-lust get out of hand may not be the wisest plan of action. These reports should be a warning for liberal-minded parents and administrators: the vampir-ification stops here.
So for all the teenaged vampires out there: next time you want to feel that “thick, warm copper-tasting blood,” pick up a glass of tomato juice instead.

The recent explosive reaction towards Stephen Hawking’s latest book about the origins of the universe rivals that of the Big Bang itself. Twenty years ago, in “A Brief History of Time,” Hawking famously posited that if science one day discovers a theory for explaining the universe’s creation, “we would know the mind of God.” Last month, however, Hawking released “The Grand Design,” a work in which he claims that science has finally uncovered this theory but has kicked God out of the picture in the process.
In response, an extraordinarily prominent group of religious leaders—including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chief Rabbi of England, and the committee chairman of the Muslim Council of Britain—have blasted Hawking for what they claim is an overreach of science into the realm of religion. As the Chief Rabbi of England put it, “Even great science tells us nothing about G-d…Science is about explanation. Religion is about interpretation.” While Hawking does sometimes transgress the limits of science in “The Grand Design,” however, Hawking’s larger argument stays squarely in its proper realm, and if anything these religious leaders are overstepping their bounds by impinging on it.
M-theory, Hawking explains, posits that there exist myriad universes parallel to our own. Our particular universe is hospitable to life not because it was fine-tuned specifically for us, Hawking argues, but because it just happens to be a universe in which life could develop. We, in a sense, struck lucky. In addition, he says, although matter cannot normally appear out of thin air, negative gravitational energy can counterbalance the positive energy necessary to form things. “Because there is a law such as gravity,” Hawking writes, “the universe can and will create itself from nothing.”
Whether this actually makes any sense is another question entirely (I won’t pretend to understand theoretical physics, even if Hawking does dumb it down quite a bit in his book). But the point is that if M-theory does hold true, it would explain the apparent orderliness of the universe and its creation ex nihilo without appealing to a deity.
Occasionally, Hawking overinflates the importance of this scientific accomplishment. At the beginning of the book, for example, Hawking implies that M-theory can provide us not only with an explanation of the universe’s origin but its meaning and purpose as well. Existential questions have always been “questions for philosophy,” Hawking writes, but “philosophy is dead,” and “scientists have become the bearers of the torch in our quest for discovery.” Clearly, however, physics is no substitute for metaphysics. Science may explain how the phenomena in the universe around us work, but it can never delve into the true mysteries of existence since it is ultimately stuck on the “how.” Theology and philosophy are the disciplines that bridge the gap between our search for meaning and what we can deduce in a laboratory.
Still, however, M-theory (assuming its coherence) fits into a larger framework of how scientific progress has helped shape religious belief over time. Although Hawking’s detractors would like to believe that religion is limited solely to questions of value, virtually all religions over the course of history have made factual claims also. And some of those claims fall directly under the purview of science.
Consider, for example, the following two beliefs traditionally held by some monotheistic religions: “There exists a supernatural force called God upon which all existence is dependent,” and “God created the universe six thousand years ago over the course of six days.”
The first claim would fit the paradigm espoused by the bishop, the rabbi, and the imam. Because this is a metaphysical statement, science has no place in determining its validity. Hawking’s critics are reacting to his book as though he has challenged a claim like this—that is, by arguing that M-theory completely precludes God’s existence.
But Hawking does no such thing. All he argues is that M-theory makes God’s place in the universe’s creation redundant.
Enter the second claim. Technically, science can never totally disprove a statement like this one either. But it can make it exceedingly unlikely. So unlikely, in fact, that most mainstream religious leaders today have reinterpreted their theologies in light of scientific discoveries. The universe may have been created in more than six solar days because the Bible says that the sun and moon were created on day four. Life may have been formed by natural selection over millions of years, but God implanted a soul within man after his evolution. Now that yet another scientific challenge has come to the fore, the burden rests on theologians once again to decide how it affects a long-standing religious belief—this time, that a deity is needed to explain the universe’s creation at all.
Great science, then, can tell us plenty about God. Although religion grapples with deep questions of the human experience in a way that science can’t, religion needs science as a method of understanding the extent of God’s relationship—if it exists at all—with the universe. Spiritual leaders and thinkers, therefore, ought to use “The Grand Design” as a framework for getting closer to the transcendent splendor that they seek, instead of burning Hawking at the stake for simply doing his job.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, there has been a great deal of debate about whether President Obama should extend President Bush’s 2001 tax cuts, and, if so, whether Obama should extend them for all tax brackets, or only for those making more than $250,000 per year. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has advocated letting the cuts expire, while Americans for Tax Reform has printed a satirical “Obama Tax Hike Exemption Card,” accusing the President of reneging on campaign promises. Obama and former Office of Management and Budget Director, Peter Orzag, have sparred publicly over whether the administration should consider extending the cuts for the richest families, if that’s what it takes to overcome Republican obstructionism in Congress.
All of these matters are vital ones to consider going forward. But in all of this debate, there’s a crucial observation missing, a fact that we can only discover by looking back. Regardless of what happens in the next few months, any tax increases that occur aren’t President Obama’s. They are President Bush’s.
This sounds, of course, like a stereotypical attempt for a supporter of one administration to foist its missteps upon its predecessor. I might seem like just another member of the “blame Bush” crowd. But I’m not. The upcoming tax increases were passed by a Republican Congress in 2001 and 2003 and signed into law by President Bush.
Now, that fact may surprise you, if you followed politics at any point during the Bush presidency. Bush was supposedly a tax cutting President, not a tax-raising one.
And that’s true. But it’s only half of the story. The 2001 tax cut bill cut income taxes across the board, although it especially benefited the wealthy. However, it came with sunset provisions: The tax cuts were set to expire in 2010. That’s what the bill pretended to be: a bill of temporary tax cuts.
But think about that some more. President Bush’s “temporary” tax cuts lasted for 10 years. That’s as far into the future as Congress budgets. Economic forecasts 10 years in advance are entirely unreliable. Ten years ago, the dot-com bubble was just wrapping up. Ten years before that, the Soviet Union still existed.
So sure, we can consider the 2001 tax bill a temporary tax bill. But it requires us to stretch the definition of temporary to the breaking point. Having a piece of cake after running a marathon may be a temporary suspension in your diet. Having a piece of cake every day for 10 years certainly is not.
And if we reject this frame, if we abandon the notion that tax cuts naturally expire after 10 years, what do we find? Think about it like this: the bill combined incremental tax cuts beginning at once, along with a steep and violent tax hike in 10 years. In fact, conservative political groups have called the tax hike that President Bush signed into law the largest in American history.
With this in mind, the current debate takes on an entirely different character. President Obama isn’t just another Democrat, raising the nation’s taxes. Instead, he’s acting to reverse the tax hikes of his Republican predecessor, and the Republicans in Congress are pledging to thwart this effort. It sounds strange, but it’s true.
The real lesson of all of this is more general. The reason that we’re in this mess in the first place is that American politicians are unwilling to deal with our tax code honestly. If President Bush wanted to cut taxes in a long-term, serious way, then he should have made them permanent from the start. If President Obama wants some of those taxes to be higher, then he shouldn’t create temporary extensions for them now. When presidents seek to hide their changes to the tax code by declaring them temporary, they may win a transient political victory. But they do the American public a severe, long-term disservice. We need stability in our tax code, no matter what the rates are, and honesty and accountability from our politicians, no matter what their economic policies. President Bush, as we can see, wasn’t very good about either of those points. I hope President Obama will do better.

Hey HBS Professor Amy J. C. Cuddy: Your research shows that body positioning directly influences hormones that affect feelings of power. How can Harvard students increase their sense of empowerment before a big midterm?
 
Don’t walk into a test after you’re crouching over your laptop studying. Don’t walk right in after you’re in that contractive pose, which is sort of the posture that we take on when we’re studying. Get up. It’s not just movement—I’m saying literally make yourself bigger. Swing your arms around, stretch your arms out. Spread your legs. Put your feet up on the table. Do these expansive things before you go into the classroom to take the test. And, likewise, certainly it also helps to be doing it while you’re in the room.

After work, most people carry their laptops back to their cars. After work, Seth Carbonneau sometimes carries his car to his laptop.
Standing 5 foot 4 inches with a brown buzz cut and a mild, courteous demeanor, nobody would be too shocked to hear that Carbonneau works as a lab technician at Harvard’s Dana Farber Cancer Institute. On Saturday, Sept. 25, however, Carbonneau traveled to the "New Hampshire’s Strongest Man" contest.
With events like the car deadlift and the monster-tire flip, the strongman competition was not for the faint of heart (or faint of anything pertaining to the musculoskeletal system). Take note: the tagline for the meet was "Lift Heavy or Die". Participating in the 175-lb.-and-under division, Carbonneau chose the former of the two options—representing cancer researchers everywhere, he successfully deadlifted a Jeep Wrangler that weighed nearly three times his body weight.
Speaking about his favorite aspects of Strongest Man, Carbonneau praised the sense of community. "There’s real camaraderie and sportsmanship. Even if you’ve never met anyone at a competition, you’ll talk immediately," he explained.
Gina Melnik, Carbonneau’s training partner, first introduced him to the world of improbably-large-object-heaving. Like Carbonneau, Melnik is not merely a physical force to be reckoned with, having earned her doctorate in experimental psychology from Tufts University.
The two met in a local gym while doing similar power-lifting routines and then struck up a conversation. The rest is history.
But why did such heavy-weight thinkers become such heavy-weight lifters? When asked about the relationship between interests in academia and Herculean vehicle-raising, Melnik said she saw little besides the challenge that both present.
"I started lifting in grad school as stress-relief, and it was working with my trainer that I became introduced to Strongman. What I enjoy on an intellectual level is how things change so much between contests," said Melnik.
"Every competition has different events with multiple ways of executing them. You have to have a lot of variability in your training," said Carbonneau.
Of all people, perhaps Carbonneau would agree that the old cliché is true: variety is the spice of life, but maybe with a few Jeeps thrown in for good measure.

Move over, celebrities. Kindergartners are the new trend-setters. Scientists keep telling us lately how beneficial power naps are. Kindergartners have been doing it for years. The latest tyke trend to take hold on the college scene are the ingeniously simple pieces of rubber known collectively as Silly Bandz.
Your wrist used to just be that thing that kept your hand on your arm. Boring. Just drop a few buckz on a bag of Bandz and soon you’ll be boasting a boot, a bat, and a Bieber on your brazo (try and act like you’re not impressed by that alliteration.) I don’t care how old you are—that’s cool.
With Silly Bandz, you don’t have to get bogged down with the baggage that comes with so many of the other wrist accessories on the market. Rubber bands may be good luck, but Silly Bandz wearers make their own luck (apologies to Harvey Dent). Plus, as Boyz II Men, Ritz, and the alphabet have shown, things that end in "z" are just cooler.
Sure, LIVESTRONG bracelets fund much-needed cancer research. But Silly Bandz come in a wide variety of fun colors without the emotional strain that comes with helping to save lives. Power Balance bands may inexplicably increase your energy, balance, and focus despite just being a rubber strip on your wrist, but will they increase your social status and attractiveness like Silly Bandz? Child, please. Not to mention that having a pink T-Rex on your wrist has to be more beneficial for self-defense purposes.
Now, the makers of Silly Bandz have really tapped into their creativity and introduced lines of Silly Ringz and Silly Necklaces (not sure what happened to the "z" in that one). But, even with these new twists, nothing can beat the original. Count me in as head groupie of the Silly Bandz.

I find a new fashion choice to piss me off weekly. These trends don’t usually last long before I finally remember that I’m supposed to let people make their own mistakes or accept them for who they are, or something like that. But sometimes I can’t bring myself to be so compassionate.
Silly Bandz have made it to Week Three on my list.
I refuse to sacrifice my alcohol fund’s meager savings to purchase a package of brightly-colored plastic bands. Sure, they may come in "fun" shapes (like canoes and t-shirts!!!!!!!!!!!), but as soon as you put them on your wrist they just look like the slightly curvy elastics that they are.
A nine-year-old girl that I tutor offered me one of hers. I told her to draw me a picture instead. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t remember the last time it was encouraged to get fashion advice from third graders.
No, I don’t want to trade my barely distinguishable bear for your horse/dog/cat thing. If matching bracelets secure friendship, go make me one in purple, blue, and white. I’ll even buy the string.

What do you get by bringing together two aspiring doctors, an astrophysicist, a public servant, a religion expert and a stuffed dinosaur? The answer will rock your world. Literally. It all started in Eliot’s courtyard last May as a gesture to honor Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted, as the outgoing House Masters bid Domus farewell. Five guys came together, performed six songs, and regrouped this September to form Third Rail, Harvard’s latest musical sensation.
“Weren’t we just in the subway?” asked Isaac S. Shivvers ’10-’11, the “veteran” of the group, referring to the inspiration behind the band’s name. “The third rail powers all underground motion. You can’t touch it because it’s dangerous, but you need it,” explained Samuel R. Berman-Cooper ’12, the keyboardist with an impassioned voice
Indeed, Third Rail may be exactly what Harvard needs. From its Eliot courtyard origins, the band has made the rounds to various stein clubs and campus events. They’ve covered a wide array of popular artists, ranging from Coldplay to Juanes, and create a dancing crowd wherever it goes. Lead singer Barthalomew A. Sillah ’12, also a member of the Harvard Krokodiloes, stands out in his ability to tackle everything from Katy Perry to the raps of B.O.B. “Our objective is to bring live music back,” said Warren S. Loegering ’12, the resident “sex symbol” according to his bandmates.
“And world domination,” added Berman-Cooper. Lead guitarist M. Andres Camacho ’10 nodded his head in approval.
Julia Mitelman ’13, director of Harvard Student Agencies’ Talent Agency, plans to gradually introduce the band to other college campuses. Life beyond Harvard, though, is still a big question mark. “I’d like to keep on playing music for as long as I can,” said Shivvers, who plans to attend graduate school for astronomy.
“I’ll give music my best shot,” said Loegering. “If that doesn’t pan out, I’ll just join an old-man band, like my dad.”
Right now, however, only one thing is on their minds: recruiting roadies. “Roadies get an awesome show, free beers, and groupies,” explained Shivvers.

Resume padding is the new game in natural selection. Think about it. Animals just trick each other into mating. That peacock with all those feathers could be impotent, but his feathers prevent you from checking if that showing-off is substantiated. It’s the same with resumes. If you tell a lie with the most flash and confidence, the prospective employer will believe you whether or not you actually are an expert in whatever you claimed to be (of course, this analogy also establishes Adam Wheeler as the pinnacle of human evolution). But some pieces of resume fluff popular these days are just unforgivable.
“Social media specialist.” “Twitter expert.” “Twitter strategist.”
All of these are foul and farcical. On one level, I get it. You’re catering to your audience. Most executives are 60-year-old men—they live in a world where “experience using mail merge” is a pretty sweet and high-tech skill set. But in the world of 60-year-old men, the ability to have sex without taking pills is also a rare and coveted skill set. Yet we all have enough dignity not to write that on our resumes.
There is no strategy to Twitter. Don’t believe me? Examine these three emphatically punctuated sentence fragments: A fake Twitter. For a cat. Has over a million followers.
Kudos to you, cat—really—but I must not be bright enough to see the intricately designed strategy behind these posts: “ang ang ang ang ang I THINK I NEED SOME SORT OF SCALE FOR CHEWINESS” and “hup hooo now on couch” seem about as planned out as an Irish Catholic family. What would I do to Twitter strategize that? Compare the ratio of “ang”s to actual words and optimize for most realistic impersonation of cat chewing? Time the chewing post so that it drops at dinner time, to make the post more topical? Agonize over whether to drop another “o” on the end “hooo”?
I would do none of that. I would sit alone in my basement room with my cat and type out of my sad log of his life on Twitter. Because that is what the actual author of this stuff does. And yet over a million people tune in. This is not an example of peerless strategy; it’s an effect of boundless entropy.
But maybe this cat’s an outlier, you say. Fair enough. Let’s look at the Twitter accounts with the most followers: this is a world where Britney Spears beats Barack Obama, where Paris Hilton pwns the New York Times, and—weirdest of all—this is a place where NPR somehow has more followers than Stephen Colbert. Apparently, I’ve really missed out on the pop culture phenomenon that is “The Diane Rehm Show.”
All right, all right. So some of this can be explained away. Britney Spears keeps tighter control of her public image than the president? Too real. Paris Hilton is wealthier and more interesting than The Times? Again, too real. But this has nothing to do with Twitter “strategy.” This has to do with the fact that Britney Spears’s chest is exposed at the beach more often than our President’s is.
Maybe I just don’t get it. Maybe I’m not giving the Twitter strategists enough credit here. Maybe Cat Man did the calculations right: “If you need to post about your life on Twitter, that means you don’t have real friends to tell about your day. That means you’re a loner and loser. Which means you probably are attached to a pet. Like I am to my cat.” Maybe he realized that the nature of Twitter automatically resulted in an audience naturally selected to be losers who would enjoy the musings of a cat, and he capitalized on that. He appealed to the core demographic of the site. That could be true.
So buck up, aspiring Twitter strategists, and learn real things. Get some real skills. And real friends.

Some say there’s no reinventing the wheel, but MIT researchers have taken it far beyond what the Sumerians likely envisioned.
MIT’s SENSEable City Laboratory’s latest innovation, called the Copenhagen Wheel, is notable for taking a 6,000-year-old invention and “putting an image out there that is 15 years in the future, then making that future vision,” according to Project Direct Christine L. Outram, an MIT researcher. Intended to replace a bike wheel, it holds an environmentally friendly motor powered by the energy stored from the rider’s pedaling and braking. Its instruments also measure temperature, traffic, noise and pollution—data that can be transmitted in real time to an online database for cyclers.
The Copenhagen Wheel derived its name from a partnership between SENSEable and the Danish city of Copenhagen in 2008, in a challenge to raise the city’s biking population to 50 percent. MIT Professor Carlo F. Ratti led a student workshop to brainstorm solutions—although the trickiest part was “going from one idea to the real implementation,” Ratti said.
Outram said she hopes that the wheel will be used for diverse purposes. Though the wheel will not be available until 2011, some city mayors have already ordered the wheels to replace taxis or measure pollution, according to Outram.
“It was funny, seeing the mayor of Toronto ride [the wheel],”  Outram said. “I love the look on people’s faces when they ride this and it works. It’s like riding on air. You’re Lance Armstrong suddenly, and people get this goofy grin on their faces.”
Enrique M. Marquez, a student at the Graduate School of Education, said he thought the innovation could extend beyond cycling to problems on the mind of many Harvard students. “This could lead to other ways to produce energy,” he said. “And it would be cool if the bike’s energy could charge your iPhone while you ride it.”

In the early hours of Thursday, Sep. 16, 2009, I received an e-mail from my friend Jeff with the subject line “AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.” Usually e-mails that begin this way are about delicious sandwiches one of us has just discovered, or YouTube videos of Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing acoustic guitar, or freshmen we want to like us.
This particular morning, however, the urgency was real, and Pavement—our favorite band, the group arguably responsible for our friendship—was reuniting for four shows in Central Park. The tickets were going on sale the following afternoon, and the shows would commence in a cool 370 days.
Many scoffed at their selling tickets an entire year before the shows were to transpire, but I shut my ears to such nonsense, the way people always do when their heroes behave questionably. We bought tickets for the Thursday and Friday shows in New York, and when they announced a nationwide tour in March, we nabbed front-row seats to the Boston show as well.
Seeing Pavement three times in six days seemed excessive to basically everyone I told, principally my parents, who never understood my affection for this band despite being surprisingly open-minded about most music (for parents). It is true that I had never attempted an undertaking quite this reckless, but it is equally true that no band has ever meant more to me than Pavement. In fact, back in those halcyon days of Facebook-stalking all your future classmates—before you realize that you will never see half of them in person and sheepishly delete them over Winter Break—Jeff friended me because I had Pavement listed on my profile. (This was also back when you could search for people by band or movie, which made finding new friends based on pretension significantly easier.)
My discovery of the band at age 15 coincided—quite beautifully, I thought at the time—with the formation of my closest high school friendship. We used to sit in her silver Volvo and listen to their records and lament being born too late to see them live (we were all of 10 when they broke up). I even toolishly quoted them in my high school graduation speech, a fact I reveal only because I rest safely in the knowledge that if you are reading this, you probably also spoke at graduation. “You can never quarantine the past,” I told 200 girls on stage that night, smug with the reference that only my friend would understand. It is also worth noting that I ended this speech with “may the force be with you” (and I wondered why getting a homecoming date was such a yearly ordeal).
When we left for college, I bought her a Pavement t-shirt, and she bought me their documentary.
For the two years following that parting, I tried and mostly failed to keep our friendship alive. She studied abroad in Ghana, started two bands, and moved into an Airstream trailer. Each time I contacted her I felt sillier; she was now into veganism and nuclear disarmament, and I was still reminiscing about shows we had been to and gushing about lead singers.
Something about nursing old obsessions always feels a bit immature, and because I associated my friend so closely with Pavement, listening to them started to feel like a stand-in for still being her friend. The last time I contacted her was the day we bought the New York tickets. I wrote her a short e-mail, asking if she’d heard the news and saying I missed her. She never responded.
One of the most ridiculous things about the yearlong wait was, of course, that it presumed a life unchanged over said period. By the time September rolled around, friends had moved to Alaska and California, relationships had ended and begun, and my tickets had misplaced themselves. The New Yorker ran an entire article about this (“‘I remember thinking, This book will remind me of Pavement,’ he said. Since then, he has searched every book he owns.”), and after reading it, I found them.
The concerts themselves were perfect. I worried briefly that they would be strange and awkward, that I had built them up in my head such that they could only disappoint. Fortunately, one of their members seemed to have done the aging for all of them, and the other four retained their youthful vigor. Jeff and I were in heaven. We were also privy to an amazing spectrum of run-ins, from my summer boss to Jeff’s friend from camp to alums of this very paper. One of these explained to us at Thursday’s show that he’d had to sell his Friday ticket because his blockmate was having an engagement party. “I guess this is growing up,” he said wistfully. “Just like blink-182 said.”
Naturally, returning to school after Pavement Week has been unspeakably dull by comparison, and now that I’ve seen “The Social Network,” it honestly feels sometimes like there is nothing else to look forward to. I am trying not to let this bother me. Pavement has been good to me, it’s true, affecting me in ways far beyond the musical. To name one, I have recently realized that their lead singer created a template for every man I  have since been physically attracted to (tall, lanky, boyish, clever). Courtney Love once called him the Grace Kelly of indie rock, and while she is difficult to take seriously on any matter—especially as of late—in this instance she was definitely onto something.
I wish sometimes that I could share such observations with my high school best friend, but maybe that’s what I am meant to understand. Pavement could not and cannot save our friendship, and while it sounds absurd to think of it in those terms now, it has taken me an embarrassingly long time to accept that fact. Like most students of the humanities, I firmly maintain that poems and movies and records can make a life, and change it, and indeed improve upon it in ways previously unimaginable. But like everything, they will at times be woefully inadequate. There may come a moment when Pavement no longer occupies such a privileged spot in my emotional memory. That moment may be sooner than I expect. But I really hope it’s not the case for a while. What would Jeff and I e-mail about?

How do you get 300 servings of fresh sashimi-grade tuna, for free?  On a campus bereft of even hot breakfasts, this might seem like a impossible task.  But it turns out that the answer is laughably simple: just start one of the year’s most popular Gen Ed courses.
Science of the Physical Universe 27: Science of Cooking is indeed one of the most populated, glamorous and exclusive courses of those offered this year.  It’s no surprise; celebrated chefs come in weekly to guest lecture, you get to eat your labs, and did we mention that it’s a Gen Ed science course about food? But with the creation of such a  class came a whole host of logistical challenges, even beyond the very visible one of managing the lines for the public lectures. In addition to flying chefs in from around the world, the course’s organizers needed food-friendly labs, and, well, food.
However, with no slackening of the ambition that got such a class started in the first place, its creators set out to do the unheard of: get a free lunch, gourmet style. Even they admitted the uniqueness of this route: “It’s fairly normal to have a professor’s lab or research sponsored by grants, for example, but this is the first time I’ve ever heard of a class being sponsored, especially an undergraduate one,” said David A. Weitz, a physics professor and one of the course’s founders. But in the end it got done, with Whole Foods providing the victuals, Cole Parmer much of the lab’s cooking equipment, Alicia Foundation most of the chemicals needed for the labs, and other companies, such as Mars, providing financial support.
But how was the Science of Cooking team able to get so many big players on board? “First of all, it’s Harvard.  And it’s new. And furthermore, they’re able to get their names associated with these chefs,” said Christina M. Andujar, a faculty administrator in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) who was responsible for much of the contact with the course’s sponsors.  “This is pop culture now. Ten or fifteen years ago no one watched cooking shows, and the course probably wouldn’t have been as popular as it is today.”
“I suspect they like seeing their logo at the public lectures, which are wildly popular,” said Naveen N. Sinha, head teaching fellow of the class.
Each sponsor had its own more nominal priorities coming into the term, however. Some emphasized their eagerness to be part of such a large-scale effort at culinary education.  The Alicia Foundation, an institute for science and cooking research led by Ferran Adria, even supplied the course’s organizers with lists of questions for students to try and answer for their final projects, the same sort of questions that the Alicia foundation researches. “Alicia has been instrumental not just for financial, but also for intellectual support,” said Michael P. Brenner, professor of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics, and another of the course’s founders.
Some of the course’s sponsors more directly pointed to the contact with celebrity chefs that would come of their association with the well-connected class. Cole Parmer, a Chicago-based company, was especially excited for the connection with Grant Achatz of the restaurant Alinea, in Chicago, while Mars representatives came to visit for Enric Rovira, the course’s guest chocolatier.
Whole Foods, which now makes weekly deliveries to the lab, also echoed the educational motivation of supporting the class. “The course matches what we are trying to do in educating people about food,” said David Remillard, of the Whole Foods on River Street  in Cambridge, who serves as Whole Foods’ liaison with the course, communicating directly with Sinha about the lab’s weekly orders.  “We partner with community kitchens, and, for example, with the Cambridge Culinary School, but this is unique in my tenure, to be partnering with an undergraduate course,” he said.
Unique as it may be, the relationship seems to be working well on both ends.  “They’ve been quite accommodating; when we needed to switch the recipe at the last minute to use more salt, we were able to switch it easily,” said Sinha.  “Accommodating” is perhaps a slight understatement, as the gestures of these sponsorships take on a whole new magnitude when the sheer scale of the operation is considered. According to Brenner, last week’s order for supplies included 300 eggs, 20 pounds of sugar, chocolate chips and butter, and 10 pounds of flour, all of which went towards making a molten chocolate cake and accompanying ice cream.  Not to mention the sashimi sushi of the week before.
Perhaps largest of all, however, was the donation of the food-safe lab space that allowed the delicious cake and ceviche to avoid being, say, corroded by Acetone. Thanks to the new Northwest Laboratories, the class was actually able to get unused labs for the class, a quite generous contribution when you consider that to stay food-safe, the labs cannot be used for anything else. “If they used it for another class, it would be hard to get it back to being safe for food; but I’d venture to say that this class isn’t going anywhere,” said Andujar. Start thinking about your bribe for next year’s lottery.  Your average chocolate chip cookies probably won’t do.

General wisdom is that the best strategy is the knock-and-wait. All Dorm Crew employees get a master key while out on the job. Only if there is no response, however, does a worker turn the key. Rachel V. Byrd ’13 is wearing sweatpants and an old T-shirt. Her hair is pulled back and her iPod touch is charged. Sometimes she has a water bottle with her, but today she doesn’t. Byrd, a Dorm Crew captain, is from Brooklyn, via the rural suburbs of upstate New York’s Sullivan County, and says she grew up helping her mom clean around the house. She lives in DeWolfe, and her stage presence permeates her everyday interactions. To pick her out of a crowded Lamont Café, she suggests you look for her dreadlocks.
The first moment of entrance into the room, when Byrd crosses the threshold in her close-toed shoes, is the only time when a student ever enters the room of another student without the latter’s permission, or even knowledge. But entering a room is a necessary step to entering the bathroom, and that is what Dorm Crew workers are there to do. Byrd likes to look around a suite on her way to the bathroom. She doesn’t touch anything, but she does think about what the people in the room are like, what their interests are, who they might be. One room in Claverly had a window seat, draped with chartreuse curtains and a poster of the Eiffel Tower on the well-organized and quite-full closet. The lampstand beside the bed on the left itself resembled the Eiffel.
“I bet they’re dramatic,” Byrd says on her way to the palm-tree-toothbrush-holder adorned sink. Looking above one of the beds: “And they have great scarves.”
Guys’ bathrooms, according to Byrd, tend to be cleaner than those of girls. “In guys’ bathrooms, you don’t find sanitary products which smell taking the garbage out; you don’t find makeup; there’s no hair in the shower and drain and on the walls.,” says Byrd. “Guys’ bathrooms are easy. I can expect a gross toilet. Girls’ bathroom I don’t know what to expect.”
Whether the occupants are in their room or not is a defining part of a bathroom-cleaning experience. If they are, there is the possibility of making friends, or conversation, or possibly just awkwardness. If they aren’t, there is the potential for solitude, reflection, or uninhibited dancing. This room is empty, and with bucket, broom, and Floorpol—Dorm Crew’s term for what is essentially a Swiffer with detachable pads—in tow, she locates, scans, and attacks the bathroom.
There are different approaches to gain the same end, though Dorm Crew does have some stipulations for how a room should be cleaned. First come the specifications about the supplies used. The blue spray, called Butcher’s Look, is for the mirror and fixtures. The Morning Mist spray, yellow rag, and yellow and green sponge are for the toilet, and only the toilet. The G-Force is multi-purpose. With the teal sponge and green rag, Byrd heads for the sink.
“Some Dorm Crew people don’t use gloves for anything, but I use gloves in the toilet—it’s common sense,” Byrd says as she goes for the latex-protected plunge.
Byrd joined Dorm Crew because unlike the other pre-orientation programs she was offered before coming to Harvard, Dorm Crew paid her. The opportunity cost of choosing the outdoor program, the arts program, or the urban program was too high. There are very few University-sponsored elements of campus life that accentuate a student’s financial status. All students have the same all-inclusive meal plan. Almost all students live in on-campus housing, allotted by lottery. Which students dine out, or join an organization with dues, or wear designer clothing, is outside the University’s purview. Students’ financial aid is private. The mere fact of being on financial aid is personal.
But Dorm Crew is an anomaly. Of the employees, 77 percent are on financial aid, and students—including those not in Dorm Crew—know it.
“Dorm Crew, like all other on-campus jobs, highlights the difference in economic means among students,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson, pointing out that nearly a quarter of Dorm Crew workers were not on any financial aid, and those who were on aid were not “the neediest” students. Hammonds has become a supporter of the program, though she once took issue with the way it heightened class awareness. In fact, no one suggests today that Dorm Crew be phased out; the program has become entrenched in campus life.
Yet Dorm Crew has managed to be both visible and inconspicuous. One of the first lessons during training is how to leave a bathroom. After the toilet, a worker turns to the floor. Instead of working on it from any angle, she must start in the back of the room and sweep toward the door, erasing her own footsteps as she leaves, “sweeping her way out.” No evidence is left. When the occupants come back to their room, it is as if she was never there.
“BIDDIES” AND BROOMS
Before Dorm Crew, first known as the Porter Program, came maids, known as “biddies,” according to Zachary M. Gingo’s ’98 junior history paper. Once a Dorm Crew captain, Gingo is now director of Facilities Management and Operations on campus.
The term “biddy” carries vastly different connotations today than it did then (Urban Dictionary’s sample sentence for the word: “Is that biddy wearing uggs in the summer?”). Harvard’s biddies simply cleaned the rooms of Harvard’s gentlemen, who were a decidedly priveleged bunch. But in the 1940s and 50s, as Harvard’s administration decided to aim for a more inclusive, merit-based admissions process, they created the Porter Program to bring more student employment opportunities to campus. In the wake of the second World War, the funds were particularly palatable to students whose tuition was covered by the G.I. Bill but had a wife and children at home to house, feed, and clothe.
“Did a student who worked a porter job feel like a servant for wealthier undergraduates?” asked Gingo, a student-worker himself when he wrote that question in his paper. But it was a different time. In an effort to maintain the maid service in place, the then-president of Harvard University Employees Representative Association argued that it wasn’t fitting for males to be doing the domestic, menial labor that befit women. The student government made a case that would be more persuasive to modern ears; as Gingo put it, “Poor students were forced, out of necessity, to become servants of their wealthy classmate.” Today, with a revamped and and unprecedented financial aid program, Harvard’s student body is less stratified. But many students are still drawn to the hourly wage that cleaning bathrooms offers.
THE DOERS
“Doing Dorm Crew helps my family to pay my way through college,” says Jason E. Sandler ’12, a captain who’s been cleaning dorms since his freshman year. He has a gray plastic bucket in his hand, containing the various spray bottles and sponges he just used to scrub the sink.
“To me the stereotypical captain’s parents are a librarian and a teacher—highly educated people without high incomes,” says Robert Wolfreys, Crew Supervisor in Custodial Services. Dorm Crew students often say that they worked before coming to school, so it seemed only natural that they continue to do so when they got here. Sandler helped out with jobs around the house, moving branches, shoveling dirt, caring for horses and dogs and cats. Byrd too was taught at home.
“You are certainly unafraid of getting your hands dirty,” says Erik C. Fredner ’12, a captain, of Dorm Crew workers. “It definitely takes a special kind of person at Harvard to be willing to go a scrub the toilet of a person they probably know.”
Wolfreys says that in his years of watching students go through the system, he has observed that those who stick with Dorm Crew have a little bit more humility and self-assurance than other students. Sitting at his desk in the back corner of the Dorm Crew office, he has seen students come to pick up toilet paper for their suites and ask for a dark bag. “They don’t want people to see them carrying toilet paper,” he says. Dorm Crew cleaners, on the other hand, walk through the yard holding a broom.
THE EXCHANGE
Dorm Crew has its perks. One is the flexibility. The Dorm Crew office is open from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. In any of those hours, whenever best fits with an individual’s schedule, that cleaner can go to a Dorm Crew office, sign out a key, and head to work.
“Say you’re working as a babysitter. They need you from whatever time to whatever time,” Byrd says. “Dorm Crew says we need four hours a week. I can give you those four hours whenever I want.”
Regular workers are required to work two hours each week of bathroom cleaning, known as “wet work.” Clean-up captains are required to put in four hours. But when those hours go in is each person’s choice, sometimes decided upon in the moment.
“My personal rule of thumb is I don’t like to clean on Saturday mornings because it is after Friday nights,” Byrd said. “I’ve done it once or twice and learned.”
Another perk, as mentioned before, is the paycheck. At $11.80, the starting wage is nearly four dollars above minimum wage, and students can work their way up to $12.70. In fact, Dorm Crew’s wages are so high that Federal Work-Study does not cover it; because the government pays 70 percent of an employed student’s hourly pay, the Dorm Crew rate would be too hefty a charge for the federal government.
Perhaps what is most appealing about Dorm Crew with regard to wages comes during Spring Clean-Up, after the school year has ended and the campus empties. In what sounds like an episode of one of The Learning Channel’s fast-paced-home-redecorating series, this is the time that dorms are scrubbed down for reunions. Regular workers work 40 hours a week and make roughly $450 after taxes. Captains often work up to 100 hours, and all the overtime hours are pay-and-a-half, so captains’ hourly wage of $12.80 is raised to $19.20. Add all that up, and students are walking away with paychecks for thousands of dollars. Spring Clean-Up, and some smaller scale projects throughout the year, are employment opportunities to which Dorm Crew workers get first dibs.
“You make a ton of money really quickly,” says Fredner, who added that he earned about $4,000 last Spring Clean-Up, in part due to a secret fifth week tacked on at the end. “In town,” he said, “I don’t know any job that would allow you to make much more than that.”
And students who do Dorm Crew are just as involved in other activities. When the program was first phased in from the maid service system that preceded it,  Carroll M. Lowenstein ’82, one of three original captains, was also the captain of the football team. Byrd sings in Kuumba, plays in Padame, an African music and dance group, and acts. Sandler sings with the Glee Club and has G-chat statuses that read, “Conquer Cancer! Join a Harvard Relay For Life Committee today! Email me for details...”
“There is no real wealth but the labor of man.” Percy Shelley, whose portrait glowers from the top of the colored printer-paper arrayed on the wall of the Dorm Crew closet in Claverly.
“Work and acquire and thou hast chained the wheel of chance.” Emerson, opposite the spray bottles.
“Life grants nothing to mortals without hard work.” Horace.
“Our work is the presentation of our capabilities.” Goethe, by the bucket holding Floorpols.
“All work is noble; work alone is noble.” Thomas Carlyle, looking exhausted.
“To labor is to pray.” The Benedictine Order.
“As a cure for worrying, work is better than whiskey.” Edison.
Taped to the side of the supply closet, these posters articulate the Dorm Crew ethos—it is a job, but it’s something more. While not all Dorm Crew workers meditate on these mantras as they clean, the words still hang beside the supplies, and their prominence is not accidental. But when cleaners are on the job, civilian students do not see these epigraphs. They see a peer with a broom.
At its inception, Dorm Crew was more holistic than just the bathroom cleaning it does now, and bed-making and other services were included in a worker’s tasks though the 1960s. Some students felt, the Harvard Bulletin said, an “indefinable emotional repulsion toward the idea of their fellow students prowling through their beds and papers.” But that displeasure was not enough to offset the benefits of the program.
Today’s students sometimes also express hesitation about Dorm Crew, but for a different reason. While trust might be a major factor of Dorm Crew—master keys are powerful tools—workers’ integrities are not questioned. Instead, the question is the propriety of having a program that puts students in a position of serving other students in such a fundamentally menial way. Yale and Harvard both phased out their maid services in 1951, but while Harvard introduced the Porter Program, Yale instead asked all its students to clean up for themselves, according to Gingo’s paper.
“I think it is a concern on a number of levels,” says Meg Brooks Swift, the director of the Student Employment Office and Undergraduate Research Programs. “It is incredibly antiquated to think about how the system is set up. I think it is a very Harvard thing, and in 2010 it is amazing to me that it still happens.”
The awkwardness is apparent to Dorm Crew workers themselves when they are the ones opening the door. “It’s weird, yeah,” Kai Fei ’14, a novice worker, says of when his own bathroom is cleaned. “I mean, people come clean my room and I feel weird just sitting there.”
In an article in Harvard Magazine, printed in January 2006, John A. La Rue ’07 wrote about the door-knocking experience from the worker’s perspective. “Everyone knows that some students work hard every day just to be here, and others don’t,” he said. “It’s just a lot more comfortable when we don’t have to confront the personal realities of that gap. It’s a lot more comfortable when I knock and no one’s home.”
But Dorm Crew students say that though they have their awkward moments—walking in on students having sex, waking people up—it’s not unbearably uncomfortable. Dorm Crew cleaners generally say that they like Dorm Crew.
Sandler likes to make small talk with the people whose room he is cleaning. Others prefer when no one is home for reasons that have nothing to do with social discomfort.
“Amidst a busy schedule those, two or four hours may actually be the only few hours you have with yourself,” says Byrd. “You, your iPod. You can think about what you want. I’ll listen to church CDs, a podcast...it doesn’t have to be about the task in itself.”
The task itself also can be fulfilling. Much of what students grapple with at Harvard is intangible. Marx, Kant, Tolstoy, number theory. Success with such figures is difficult, if not impossible, to map, and after hours in a library, who is to say what progress has really been made?
“You are sitting there with some esoteric philosophical argument and getting nowhere, so it is this really satisfying work to then stand up and go to a bathroom and scrub the sink until it is clean,” Fredner says. The product is visible and indisputable. The labor put in leads to results.
“There is something satisfying about the last wipe of the mop and seeing how beautiful you have made that bathroom,” Byrd says.
When cleaning, Byrd uses a trick her mom taught her. When you wet something it looks cleaner, so she dampens a rag and runs it along the sink so that it shines.
“It makes you very thankful and appreciative of the other employees,” says Byrd of the experience of Dorm Crew. “Mostly because of Dorm Crew I make much more of an effort to thank, speak to, and have a personal relationship with everyone I meet in the dining-hall—the swipe lady, the cook behind the grill, the professional services, all the food catering services. It makes you a lot more aware and thankful of the other Harvard employees. And it’s nice. You feel like you have something in common.”
POST-IT NOTES
If Dorm Crew is an invisible phenomenon, cleaning that happens most often in empty rooms, the Post-it is the sole opportunity for a cleaner to express herself. The Post-it note is square, pale yellow, and reads, “Dorm Crew was here. Your bathroom was cleaned today by: ________. Date: _____. Time: _____. Comments, Complaints, Compliments, dorm_crew@harvard.edu.” Students often personalize their Post-its, and last year, Byrd’s personalization led to a correspondence with a student she didn’t otherwise know.
“I wrote something like ‘your porcelain throne was restored to its former glory by’ and that person wrote to Dorm Crew and say that I had made their day,” she remembers.
Byrd e-mailed the person who had responded to her Post-it, someone who turned out to be a senior boy, to thank him for sending in her first-ever compliment. Each time she cleaned their bathroom she left a creative Post-it, and each time he would e-mail back a funny comment pertaining to her note.
“Kirkland D-22—that was my favorite room to clean. Even though their bathroom was one of the worst, I knew they would appreciate my creativity. And they always had a speaker system set up so I could blast my iPod as I cleaned.”
“We’ve never met,” she adds of the boy. “We have never talked in real life.”
In Claverly, the room with the chartreuse curtains and Eiffel Tower lamp, Byrd filled out her Post-it and stuck it on the glass—“Once again, your reflection sparkles like the sun.” But the Butcher’s Look hadn’t yet dried, and the sticky on the paper, less intense than the crazy glue the inventor of Post-its was trying to create, didn’t hold the three-by-three pale yellow square to the mirror.
“It’s always frustrating if the sticky doesn’t stick because it’s the only proof of all the hard work you’ve done,” Byrd said as the paper fell to the ground.
She picked it up, dried the spot on the mirror, and put it on the glass again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During their meeting on Monday, the Cambridge City Council decided to investigate a possible ban on smoking in open public spaces such as parks and beaches.
The policy order, passed unanimously by all nine members of the council, asked the Cambridge Public Health Department to draft a report on the feasibility of the ban.
The ban was proposed at Monday’s meeting by Councillor Marjorie C. Decker. If passed, it would extend an existing Massachusetts law that prohibits smoking in public buildings but not in open spaces.
Evaluating the effect of the proposed ban is not an easy task, said Sam Lipson, director of environmental health for CPHD.
“There are many nuances that will come out of this,” he said.
Because the evaluation will involve multiple government bodies—including the Cambridge Police Department, Department of Public Works, and Inspectional Services Department—Lipson said it is hard to predict whether the report will favor the ban.
According to Lipson, the departments will take into consideration the particular layouts of different open public spaces and explore how the proposed ban might affect, for example, a space surrounded by dense residential buildings.
Lipson said that the departments will also investigate whether it would be practical to enforce the order. “Who would enforce this and by what mechanism?” he said.
CPHD and the other departments aim to complete the report on the ban by later this fall, when the Council will discuss the policy again.
Karen Cecchini, the manager of Leavitt & Peirce, a 127-year-old tobacco shop in Harvard Square, expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed ban.
“I think people should be allowed to smoke wherever they want to smoke,” she said.
Banning indoor smoking is understandable, but banning it in open public space is not, Cecchini said, because “it’s not really affecting other people.”
Decker modeled her proposal after a similar one suggested by New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. She could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hollman Morris Rincon, a Colombian journalist and Nieman Fellow who was initially denied a visa this summer to study in the United States, was recently awarded the 2011 Nuremberg International Human Rights Award for his coverage of human rights violations in Colombia.
According to the website of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, the award, which is given every two years by the Human Rights Office of the City of Nuremberg, Germany, “is intended to contribute towards the observance and implementation of Human Rights as a universal and indivisible principle.”
Morris’ work as the producer of an independent television news program called “Contravia” included critical coverage of former Colombia President Álvaro Uribe Vélez’s administration.
“This award came at a special moment of my life,” Morris said. “It came at a time of intense struggle for justice without impunity [in Colombia].”
Morris, who was later granted the visa to study in the United States that he was originally denied on “security and related grounds,” said he greatly appreciates the help he received from the Nieman Foundation in securing the visa.
Morris explained that prior to arriving in the United States to study as a Nieman Fellow about a month ago, he and his family could not leave their home without the protection of bodyguards due to his journalistic work.
During Uribe’s presidency, the Colombian secret service persecuted independent reporters and all those who opposed the administration, Morris said.
The award recognizes over 20 years of work by Morris and also commemorates the victims of Uribe’s administration.
Now at Harvard, Morris said that he finally has the opportunity to live a “normal” and “peaceful” life that he and his family did not experience in Colombia. He said the biggest change has been the ability to ride a bicycle or walk through Cambridge without worrying about secret police or having bodyguards.

Vital signs—which typically include heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and blood pressure—may now be able to be monitored using a webcam, according to a study published by researchers at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the MIT Media Lab.
In this study, the researchers focused on measuring heart rate using low-resolution webcams. The cameras, which can accurately detect health indicators in household or work settings, enable one to record vital sign readings, like a patient’s heart rate, just by sitting in front of a computer or a webcam-affixed mirror.
“One of the biggest advantages is that it is inexpensive and easy to use; you need a simple digital camera or a webcam,” said lead author Ming-Zher Poh, a graduate student in the HST program.
Real time monitoring of vital signs might also help with preventative screening, which the researchers believe will be a useful diagnostic tool.
“By integrating [a webcam] to your computer or mirror, it becomes a daily routine to get a [vital sign] reading, [allowing one to] collect long term data for days or months,” Poh adds. “The computer or mirror can also act as a portal for telemedicine with a physician,” an intervention that Poh explained could reduce hospital visits while facilitating early disease detection.
The technology uses webcams to record cardiac pulse waves detected from a human face. The researchers explained that heart rate modifies volumetric changes in facial blood vessels, which alters the path of ambient light. Scientists can then use mathematical algorithms to calculate the amount of light reflected from a face to determine heart rate.
Reducing unwanted reflective light sources was one of the most difficult challenges, according to Poh. Factors such as small bodily movements or minor environmental light changes cause fluctuations in the light source and can significantly alter reading accuracy.
The researchers’ ability to overcome this challenge—a key finding in the work—was accomplished by using processing methods that extract signals from the heart while reducing unwanted noise.
The technology has begun to attract investors, and Poh said that they are continuing to work on further improvements.
“This was a proof of concept,” Poh said. “We want to push it further to more physiological signals such as respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure.”
The study was published in a recent issue of the journal Optics Express.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds has charged a new working group with examining student life issues on campus for bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgender undergraduates.
The announcement comes after a number of highly publicized suicides by students associated with the LGBT community, and after a Harvard undergraduate was the victim of a hate crime and robbery last month.
“One thing that concerns all of us right now is the recent visibility of the suicide and bullying and mental health issues more broadly in the LGBT community. We’re seeing this across the country and certainly we want to address that issue,” said History and Literature Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, who said he will be a member of the committee.
College spokesman Jeff Neal said the committee had been in the works since this summer—before the recent incidents transpired. He said, however, that the incidents would inform the committee’s discussions.
“We fully anticipate that working group members will bring an awareness of these national incidents and that it will no doubt help frame their work,” he said.
The committee will be chaired by Susan B. Marine, assistant dean of Harvard College for student life and the director of the Harvard College Women’s Center, which has sometimes served as an informal hub for the LGBT community.
Marine said the College “recognized that we’re not necessarily meeting the needs of everyone,” and that the committee would look into “lots of unanswered questions.”
The exact topics the committee will cover have not been announced, but in her letter to the committee, Hammonds listed seven questions for the committee to answer, including, “What are the most appropriate structures for advising and support of BGLT student organizations?” and “How might the College create and enhance meaningful intergenerational partnerships within the existing BGLT student and alumni/ae communities at Harvard?”
Harvard College Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 called the creation of the new working group “fantastic,” adding that he was excited to see the committee formalized.
“It’s been a long time in the making, but there have been a number of events since the beginning of the year that gave greater sense of urgency to this,” said Chan.
Chan will sit on the committee along with fellow QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12, faculty members, administrators, and at least one other student.
Wang said the committee could result in the appointment of a director or an administrator to address issues faced by the LGBT community at Harvard, but because the committee has not begun meeting it is too soon to predict what it will conclude.
“It is a bit too early to tell. The working group is going in with the mindset that nothing is a foregone conclusion,” she said.
The committee aims to finish its work by the end of the academic year, according to Marine.

A series of major renovations across the Houses—which Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said last year was anticipated to begin in 2012—could be delayed, depending on funds available for the project.
At the Faculty meeting on Tuesday, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith did not specify a particular start year for the venture, saying that the beginning of construction is still several years away.
The start of construction will depend on the funds available to the University, Smith said.
First announced in April 2008, House renewal is an ambitious project that aims to revitalize the physical infrastructure of the 12 residential Houses and make significant changes to program offerings and the roles of House staff members.
Administrators said at the time of the announcement that the planned changes include gutting the Houses and transforming their interiors to better fit students’ needs.
In 2008, Smith said that Harvard would spend “over a billion dollars” on the project.
While Smith has never publicly issued an official start date for House renewal, past statements from administrators have offered an evolving timeline for the project’s start date.
When House renewal was first announced, it was anticipated to start as early as 2011. But in March 2009, Nelson, then-associate dean for residential life, said that construction was scheduled to begin as early as 2012—one year later than the original estimate.
Nearly three months later, amid an unprecedented 27.3 percent loss in the University’s endowment and FAS budget cuts totaling $77 million, Smith and Nelson reiterated that 2012 was “the earliest possible” deadline.
And in Sept. 2009, Nelson, who had assumed the post of dean of student life, pointed to 2012 as the likely start date.
“We anticipate actual construction for 2012, and I think we should keep talking about this date,” she said at the time.
Nelson said in Feb. 2010 that while the construction start date was “dependent on our financial climate and philanthropic gifts,” planning for House renewal had not slowed down.
“That is right on target,” she said.
Nelson did not return a request for comment for this article.
FAS spokesman Jeff Neal said that Smith’s comments at the Faculty meeting did not constitute an actual change in plans.
“Dean Smith has always said that—regardless of when we might be prepared from a planning perspective—the decision to move to the construction phase would always depend on funding,” Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement. “[Smith] reiterated that exact point at Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting. Nothing has changed.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 9, 2010
An  earlier version of the Oct. 7 news article "No Start Date Set For House  Renewal" incorrectly stated that a series of major renovations across  the undergraduate Houses could be "further delayed." Contrary to the  phrase's suggestion, there was no earlier instance of delay. The  administration had stated in the past as a possible timeline that  renovations could start as early as 2011.

Departments within the Division of Arts and Humanities are looking to fill holes in their faculty left after nearly two years of reduced hiring in the face of a tight budget.
But departments in the division reported receiving inconsistent numbers of authorized searches, often in accordance with their respective sizes.
The English department, for instance—which has over 140 undergraduate concentrators—has been authorized to launch two tenure-track searches—one for a contemporary American specialist with an Asian-American focus and another for a Renaissance specialist, according to Department Chair W. James Simpson.
Some smaller departments, such as Celtic languages and literatures and Classics, said they have been authorized to conduct fewer searches.
According to Catherine McKenna, chair of Celtic languages and literatures, her department—with a faculty of “just three”—does not “anticipate being in a position of seeking to hire in the foreseeable future.”
The Classics department—with approximately 34 undergraduate concentrators—has been authorized to conduct one search, despite the fact that the department lost two professors last year and will lose a third, Gisela Striker, at the end of this year.
At Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said FAS conducted over 40 searches last year.
Mark J. Schiefsky, the Classics department’s director of undergraduate studies, said that he felt his department was not particularly disadvantaged in only having been authorized a single search.
“Obviously, everybody is cutting back,” he said. “We’re very glad to have the one search authorized. It will enable us to continue in the way that we have been.”
In terms of the undergraduate experience in Classics, he said that the department’s focus is now concentrated on the necessities rather than on the “optimal kinds of courses we would like to be able to give.”
But, he added, having two Harvard College Fellows in the department is a temporary solution to the department’s decreased teaching staff.
For her part, Striker, a joint professor in both the Classics and Philosophy departments, said that the most unfortunate consequence of the search allocations will be the impact on the graduate program in Ancient Philosophy.
“We have [a program], but I think that it’s dead,” she said. “With just one senior person on the Classics side, and one junior person on the Philosophy side, you just can’t have a graduate program.”

“Slow Food” founder Carlo Petrini traveled across the Atlantic to share a message of responsible consumption and sustainability with over 100 members of the Harvard and Cambridge communities last night in the Science Center.
The Slow Food movement—which gets its name from an inversion of the term fast food—is a 100,000-person international initiative that is focused on “linking the pleasure of good food with a commitment to [people’s] community and the environment,” according to the Slow Food website.
Petrini erupted onto the stage with a message of conservation and a call to action delivered in Italian and translated by his aide.
“In the last 20 years we’ve put more chemicals and chemical products into the earth than in the preceding 120 years,” Petrini told the audience through his translator. “It’s like a bomb...we are creating ecological bombs.”
Petrini continued to engage his audience, armed with a flurry of facts about the effects of over-consumption and industrialized agriculture.
The Slow Food presentation—which was organized by Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ Food Literacy Project—was the realization of an event that was originally scheduled for last April. The event was postponed because of flight delays caused by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull.
Throughout his speech, Petrini—whose organization also holds a conference every two years called “Terra Madre” to connect farmers and Slow Food members worldwide—extolled the virtues of local-controlled consumption, as opposed to modern methods of food production and distribution.
“To transform and bring about real change in this food system is a political duty and right everyone has,” Petrini said. “It’s not we who eat food, it’s the food that eats us.”
Petrini, 61, interspersed his serious discussion about the dangers of industrialized farming and consumption with pointed witticisms.
“In Italy we have this premier, [Silvio] Berlusconi, who constantly tells us to consume,” he said. “It’s like taking someone with bad diabetes into a pastry shop.”
But Petrini also offered proposed solutions to the current “food system,” insisting that the problems Slow Food endeavors to combat are not intractable ones.
“It’s the young who have in your hands the key to the solution,” Petrini said in closing.
After his presentation, Petrini invited young people who planned to commit their lives to the goals of Slow Food to come down from their seats to the front of the auditorium.
“You are my heroes,” Petrini said as he shook the hands of the 12 people who walked to the stage.
One of those “heroes,” Sam Bett, is the editor and publisher of his own Slow Food-related magazine, “Easy Jaws.”
“It was very empowering,” Bett said of Petrini’s speech. “[He] put ideas I have in a real light.”
After Petrini’s presentation, the Harvard COOP sold—and Petrini signed—copies of his book “Terra Madre” and the book “Inquiries into the Nature of Slow Money,” for which he wrote a forward.

Harvard Business School Professor Tarun Khanna recently assumed the position of director of the University’s South Asia Initiative.
Khanna, who has served on the Initiative’s steering committee since 2007, studies emerging markets in India and China and wrote the book “Billions of Entrepreneurs.”
He will be succeeding Sugata Bose, professor of oceanic history and affairs and the Initiative’s founding director. Khanna said Bose “made extraordinary contributions” in promoting awareness of South Asia’s history and culture.
“I am very excited, humbled, [and] somewhat blown-away” to become director and follow in Bose’s footsteps, Khanna said.
“Since its inception, Harvard’s South Asia Initiative has built strong foundations based on teaching and research partnerships,” Provost Steven E. Hyman told the Harvard Gazette. “Tarun’s extensive experience, thoughtfulness, and dedication will help him guide the initiative to new levels of success and engagement across the Harvard community.”
As the new director, Khanna said that he hopes to preserve many of his predecessor’s programs, including the “South Asia Without Borders” speaker series.
He will also work to expand existing study-abroad and research opportunities and make funding more easily accessible, he said.
After having a positive experience leading a freshman seminar entitled “Shaping Modern China and India” in the spring of 2008, Khanna said he hoped to encourage South Asia Initiative faculty members to teach more undergraduate courses.
He noted that Harvard already has well-established programs in Latin America and China but a comparatively “weaker investment in South Asia.”
He said he sees room for the Initiative to grow, calling it “a canvas” with which to take advantage of Southeast Asia’s “booming and exuberant culture.”
Since individual schools already have their own efforts in South Asia, Khanna said his goal is to facilitate “inter-faculty projects.”
“There is significant room for interdisciplinary efforts, especially in contemporary affairs regarding health issues or social entrepreneurship,” he said.
Jorge I. Dominguez, vice provost for international affairs, praised Khanna’s past work experience.
“Faculty colleagues from various schools who work in or about South Asia hold him in high regard,” Dominguez wrote in an e-mail.
Khanna also heads faculty oversight for Harvard Business School’s India Research Center. The dual appointment will allow the University to better coordinate efforts between the schools, Dominguez wrote.

Updated: 10/7 1:10 a.m.
The Harvard women’s tennis team is sent some of its players to the 2010 Riviera/ITA Women's All American Championships this week in Pacific Palisades, Calif. Facing some tough competition, Harvard players found some wins and some losses but the early tournament has helped the team assess how it matches up with other squads across the country.
“It’s a privilege for our squad to make this tournament,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “It’s a privilege to play against top opponents. We are taking each match very seriously, and our goal is to improve with every match.”
The tournament was divided into three separate brackets for each of the singles and doubles competitors. Players who were invited to the pre-qualifying or qualifying draws are given a chance to play into the main draw through a series of wins in the single elimination opening draws.
First there was a pre-qualifying round with 64 singles players and 32 doubles teams. Those who made it through three rounds succeeded in making the qualifying round, which has brackets equal in size to the pre-qualifying one. The eight singles players and four doubles teams that advance in the qualifying round enter the main draw to fill out brackets already containing top-ranked singles players and duos.
In the pre-qualifying singles bracket, sophomore No. 114 Hideko Tachibana lost on Saturday to Florida’s Alex Cercone, 6-4, 7-6 (2).
“I’m proud of the way [Tachibana] competed,” Green said.
Classmate Kristin Norton defeated Lamar’s Kaitrina Harbuzi, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2, on Saturday before losing to another Gator, Sofie Oyen, 6-0, 6-3, later in the day.
“[Norton] puts everything into every point,” Green said.
In the doubles pre-qualifying draw, Tachibana and Norton teamed up to defeat the Texas duo of Krista Damico and Cierra Gaytan-Leach, 8-4, on Saturday. But on Sunday they met defeat at the hands of Southern California’s Alison Ramos and Valeria Pulido, 8-5.
Also in the draw, freshmen Natalie Blosser and Hannah Morrill lost to Pepperdine’s Ali Walters and Khunpak Issara, 8-1.
The qualifying singles draw featured No. 56 junior co-captain Holly Cao against North Carolina State’s Sanaa Bhambri, who advanced from the pre-qualifying round. On Tuesday, Cao lost a tight match to Bhambi. After winning the first set, 6-4, Cao dropped the next, 6-1. In the deciding set, Bhambi, a senior from New Delhi, outplayed Cao to take the set, 6-4.
“She was a tricky opponent, very deceptive,” Cao said. “I didn’t play a great match, but I’m kind of disappointed. She was very fast and hits a lot of balls back, so winning every point was pretty hard.”
Following the loss, Cao defeated the Waves’ No. 66 Arianna Colffer in the consolation draw later in the day, 6-3, 6-2.
“She hits the ball pretty hard, but wasn’t that consistent,” Cao said. “I tried to be solid and keep the balls deep. I’m glad I came away with a win.”
“She wasn’t playing her best tennis, but she showed she can compete with top players,” Green said.
The doubles bracket placed Cao and fellow co-captain Samantha Rosekrans, ranked No. 40 in the nation, against a tough field from across the country. On Tuesday, they fell, 8-5, to the No. 42 ranked Trojan duo of Maria Sanchez and Kaitlyn Christian.  Sanchez is the No. 3 ranked singles player in the country.
“[Cao and Rosekrans] played fairly well,” Green said. “The USC team played the big points better. If they get tougher on the big points, they’ll be fine.”
Cao, who was originally scheduled to play more matches in the singles consolation draw that was made optional Wednesday due to rainy weather, decided to withdraw. Also due to weather, the consolation doubles draw, in which Cao and Rosekrans were scheduled to play, was cancelled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Career firsts are always special, something an athlete will remember for the rest of his or her life. But when those firsts are the difference in a team’s win, they become even more meaningful.
Playing without injured leading scorer Brian Rogers, the Harvard men’s soccer team knew someone would need to step up on the offensive end. What the team might not have expected was that the spark would come from a freshman.
But despite playing only 52 minutes in the game, Connor McCarthy was ready when opportunity knocked.
After his team struggled to get anything going offensively in the opening half, the freshman forward’s first career collegiate goal in the 47th minute would prove to be all the Crimson (4-3-3) needed in its 1-0 victory over Holy Cross (3-6-1) last night.
“It was almost a relief, to be honest,” McCarthy said of the goal. “I’ve just been waiting for it to happen...it’s a decent amount of weight off my shoulders. I hope after the first one, I can push on to score a couple more for us.”
McCarthy’s first career score was enough on the offensive end because of the stellar goaltending of sophomore goalie Brett Conrad, who recorded his first career shutout in the contest despite playing in a low-temperature, heavy-rain environment.
“I thought it was a well-played game,” Conrad said. “It was tough conditions, but our team had set a goal going in that we were going to get a shutout regardless of whether we scored or not.”
“The win is nice, but to set a goal as a team, and then meet it the way we did, is something we’re all pretty proud of,” McCarthy added.
Neither squad was able to manage much offense in the first period, taking only three shots apiece. Crusader forward Kevin O’Connell managed the only attempt on goal, which Conrad saved.
But early in the second half, Harvard made the most of a rare opportunity.  Freshman midfielder Kyle Henderson took a pass from McCarthy and cued it back to him on the left side of the net. McCarthy took the ball and kicked a slow roller past Holy Cross goalie Evan Polanik to give the Crimson the 1-0 lead. It was Henderson’s team-leading third assist on the season.
“Obviously, [losing Rogers is] hard for a team, since he’s our big scoring threat,” Conrad said. “But a couple of freshmen really stepped up...it’s great to see them show the team they can play.”
The Crusaders had a chance to even things up in the second half, attempting two shots on goal, but Conrad made saves on both to keep his shutout alive.
“It’s great to know as an offense that if we get one goal, that’s basically it,” McCarthy said. “Our defense was stellar tonight.”
Harvard managed only two attempts on net in the contest, both by McCarthy. Sophomore forward Scott Prozeller had three shots to lead Harvard. Midfielder Matt Beckley paced Holy Cross with two.
Yet, despite the lack of attempts on goal, McCarthy said he was encouraged by the offense’s ability to create opportunities in Rogers’ absence.
“Brian’s a special player,” the freshman remarked. “Not having [him] hurts us, but our team is strong enough that we can definitely play through it...you just try different things. We’re not looking for Brian as much if he’s not there, so other guys get a chance on the ball, and other guys can do some special things with it and we end up creating just as many chances.”
Conrad, making his second start of the year in place of junior Austin Harms, made three saves in the victory.
The goalie attributed much of his success to the defense that let up only six total shots in front of him, saying the co-captain duo of Rob Millock and Jaren LaGreca was an especially big help to a keeper making just his third career start.
“Both those guys bring so much leadership to the field,” Conrad said. “I feel so confident back there with those guys in front of me.”
It was the second consecutive 1-0 shutout for the Crimson, playing its final non-conference tune-up before heading to Providence Saturday evening to take on No. 13 Brown in a pivotal Ivy contest.
“I feel good [about the first career shutout],” Conrad said. “I put a lot of work into it, but at the end of the day it’s more about the team’s success. I’m ecstatic that we pulled out our second victory in a row, and our second shutout in a row, so this really gives us momentum going into our Ivy League contest on Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing one varsity sport is difficult enough. Between offseason conditioning, early-morning training, long weekends on the road, and physically grueling matches, one thing is clear: the life of a Harvard athlete is far from easy.
While this fast-paced and demanding lifestyle may scare some away, others embrace it wholeheartedly. This is something that can be said of softball player Mari Zumbro, as the junior takes on a new challenge as a member of the Harvard women’s soccer team.
When starting sophomore goalkeeper AJ Millet sustained an undisclosed injury on Sept. 16 prior to her team’s match-up against Boston University, the Crimson was left thin in its goalie ranks.
But Harvard, not being one to collapse under adversity, has largely weathered the storm. Freshman keeper Jessica Wright has registered 29 saves in the five games she has started since Millet’s departure, helping the team win three out of those five matches.
“I don’t think that [the injury] has hindered or affected our play so far,” Millet said. “Obviously, it hasn’t been entirely positive for us. I think that we’ve done well.”
But despite Wright’s success in goal, Millet’s absence has created a series of personnel questions and concerns.
“Every soccer team really needs three goalkeepers,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said.
And with the loss of Millet for an unspecified amount of time, this has put Harvard in the uncomfortable position of having only two keepers on call at any given moment, forcing the Crimson to search for walk-ons who could at least temporarily fill in the gaps on the roster.
Though walk-ons to the women’s soccer team are relatively uncommon—­­­with only one or two attempts every year, this year proved to be different as Leone searched for a walk-on backup keeper from an unlikely source—the women’s softball team.
“I guess I got word from the softball coach that they had somebody that could possibly fill in,” Leone said. “Mari then brought it up to her coach, and then we tried her out really quickly, and it worked out great.”
The player Leone happened to stumble upon was none other than Zumbro, a utility player for the women’s softball team whose talents on the field range from pitching to the infield. On the mount, Zumbro posted an ERA of 3.28 in 2010 while batting a respectable .244 at the plate.
But Zumbro’s athletic talents also extend past the softball field.
In high school, she not only captained her softball team, but was also a member of the varsity basketball team and the starting keeper on her varsity soccer team.
Although Zumbro will be largely relegated to a backup role on Harvard’s roster, her addition to the soccer team poses some interesting questions about two-sport dynamics—questions about time conflicts, practices, conditioning, and potential injuries.
“Luckily [the softball team is] actually done with their competitive games for the off-season right now, so it’s kind of perfect timing for [Zumbro],” Leone said. “They just finished up last Sunday, so she’s done for a while. She’s still going to be working with them, with conditioning and some individual games, but we have her for a month, and we are really appreciative of [softball coach] Jenny [Allard].”
Even though Zumbro must adapt to a different sport and a new team in the coming weeks, neither the players on the women’s soccer team nor Leone seem particularly concerned. In fact, many see her experience as a softball player as an asset.
“The great thing about her playing another sport is that she understands what the Ivy League is about,” Leone said. “[She knows] how competitive it is and what she has to do to stay prepared. But the biggest addition that she brings is that she doesn’t have to go through the growing pains about wondering whether she can handle school and a sport at the same time. She can do it because she already has.”
As Zumbro takes on the challenge of being a two-sport athlete this year, one thing that remains clear is the level of optimism that others have for her.
“True, we don’t have a lot of athletes playing two sports,” Leone said.  “But…she’s played goalkeeper before, especially in high school. She has a lot of talent and a lot of energy, and she’s a great addition to the team.”

I agree with Harvard men’s soccer coach Carl Junot when he says that the hardest thing to do in soccer is to score a goal.
I was charged with that task my senior year of high school, and I learned firsthand that finding the back of the net happens in the spur of the moment. It can stem from either a fantastic individual effort or a team-oriented possession. It can come from luck—when an opportune bounce allows the ball to evade the goalkeeper—or misfortune, exemplified when a player puts the ball in the goal that he or she is guarding by mistake. No one knows when that goal will come, but one can search for it.
That is sophomore forward Brian Rogers’ job on the team, to constantly seek that opportunity to strike. He inherited the job of being the main threat to the backline of the opposing team from Andre Akpan ’10.
Last year, Rogers’ job was a little easier.  Since Akpan was constantly double-teamed due to his high profile as one of the leading strikers in the country, all Rogers had to do was wait for his chance to score when the defense was paying little attention to him. He fulfilled his role by tallying six goals on the season, good for second on the team in goals scored. Akpan and Rogers became the one-two punch that the Crimson needed to advance far into postseason play.
But throughout this year’s campaign, the squad has been unable to reproduce that flair on the attacking end. Harvard has only three wins out of nine games, and the opposition has outscored the team, 11-10.
So far, junior goalkeeper Austin Harms owns a 1.18 goals-against average, a decent record for a goalie at the collegiate level. It is also a testament to the defense’s dedication to allow the fewest amount of goals (optimally zero) as possible. But if faced with the prospect of only having to deal with the opposing team scoring one goal per game, can the Crimson really not overcome that deficit?
Harvard has shown, especially in the beginning of the season against Stanford and UMass, that it can break the deadlock and shift the score to its favor. Yet, when the Crimson starts by falling behind, it is not able to fully recover, and that can be a dangerous thing.
Losses to UC Santa Barbara, Boston University, and Providence all demonstrate Harvard’s inability to overcome a deficit, and the draw against Stony Brook—when Rogers came up with the tying goal in the waning moments of the game, give the impression that there is an overreliance on Rogers to dig the Crimson out of its hole.
A team that formerly owned a No.10 ranking and then moved up to No. 6 is expected to provide the firepower to defeat unranked opponents on a consistent basis. This team has enough talent to do so, but the supporting cast around Rogers has not been able to do that thus far when it matters.
Defenders often tend to focus on Rogers, freeing up the wings to cause the damage. Yet, Rogers’ teammates have yet to take advantage of that opportunity.
Junior Jamie Rees tormented BU defenders with his quick pace two weeks ago, but didn’t have the luck to put the ball in, even when he had clear opportunities on goal.
The same went for junior midfielder Ben Tsuda, who controlled the ball well but could not come up with a dangerous shot. Sophomore Scott Prozeller, who has two goals on the season, is the type of midfielder that can control the rhythm of a game, but against the Terriers he was largely ineffective.
If that’s the case, then the midfielders need to step up to provide Rogers with the passes he needs to break free from the defense. If not, then the squad can only rely on the spectacular individual effort aforementioned, but like other team sports, that trend cannot become the norm for a team to be successful.
Let’s say we put the sub-par performance against crosstown-rival BU to the side. Harvard had Providence beat last Wednesday, outshooting the Friars, 18-8, five of which forced Friar goalkeeper Jhojan Obando to save. Providence was much more effective, converting two of its four shots on goal into scores.  The Friars were definitely not the better team, and that seems to be the case for the majority of the teams the Crimson have faced so far, but somehow those teams escape with draws or wins.
One can see the frustration in the eyes of the players, particularly Rogers, when Harvard fails to score enough goals to win.
Even though the team should play to its strengths, and rely on Rogers to score goals, the Crimson needs to provide backup when its strikers cannot deliver. Many teams have seen their sides fall due to a lack of supporting cast, and with the way the season has gone so far, Harvard will need to find a way to get productivity out of its attack soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker and his staff are clearly on a roll—and the scariest part is, they might not even be done yet.
Windward High’s Wesley Saunders (Los Angeles, Calif.) verbally committed to joining the Crimson earlier today, just a few days after Corbin Miller (Salt Lake City, Utah) gave a commitment of his own.
A 6’6, 205-lb forward who averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds per game his junior season, Saunders is the No. 80 prospect in the nation according to Rivals.com.
“What Harvard is getting is a top-level Division-I player,” said Jack Davis of CaliHighSports.com, which ranks him 16th in the state. “They’re getting a guy who can play three positions, a guy who I think could physically dominate other Ivy League players, and a guy who’s just scratching the surface of his potential.”
ESPN.com grades Saunders at an 86, calling him “one of the most debated prospects in the [W]est.”
“He’s a great physical specimen, but he needs to work on his shooting, he needs to work on his ball-handling,” Davis said. “His finer skills haven’t developed, because he was a kid who was 6’5 when he was in 8th grade.”
“In my professional opinion, he’s one of the top five best players in California,” said Miguel Villegas, Saunders’ coach at Windward. “For him to go to Harvard, it’s a steal for them...what Harvard got in Wesley Saunders was definitely the steal of the year. When you turn down two Pac-10 schools—SC and Colorado—to go to Harvard, that says a lot.”
Saunders had told The Crimson a few days ago that his final five schools were Harvard, Colorado, USC, Loyola Marymount, and Penn. He made an official visit to Cambridge this past weekend, where he was joined by Miller and Chicago big man Mike Turner.
“What makes him so good is his versatility,” Villegas said. “He’s a point-forward. The open court is where he does most of his things—he can push the rock, he can pass the ball, he’s a great teammate, he’s unselfish, he can score the basketball. He’s very talented.”
“At Harvard, they see me playing a wing-type,” Saunders said Tuesday. “What they were saying is that I’m really different from other players they have on the team in that I like to get to the basket, so they see me as an athletic three-man, who can be a playmaker that can create for the other players on the team, as well as get my points when they’re needed.”
“In the Ivy League, he’s going to be able to guard anyone from a one to a four,” Villegas added. “He’s so long and got great footwork. He knows how to play defense.”
Harvard’s future class of 2015 is currently made up of Saunders, Miller, Kenyatta Smith (Brea, Calif.), and Jonah Travis (Minneapolis, Minn.).
Guards Andre Hollins and Spencer Dinwiddie are among the top targets remaining for Amaker and his assistant coaches.
“If Spencer Dinwiddie goes to Harvard, they’ll win the Ivy League championship next year,” Davis said.

With all the hype surrounding last Thursday’s midnight premiere of “The Social Network,” FM’s Roving Reporter sacrificed a Thursday night and headed over to the AMC Loew’s Harvard Square Theater on Church Street along with hundreds of other Harvard students. While many had visibly pre-gamed the festivities, some were able to muster out coherent responses to our questions about how Harvard would be portrayed on the Big Screen. Opinions varied on whether or not Hollywood Harvard would have more whoop than it does in reality. However, in an entrance poll, 100 percent of those surveyed said they’d typically be studying. Then again, we only asked the sober ones.
Matthew M. McCarthy ’13
John H. Campbell ’14
Kevin J. Wu ’14
Roving Reporter: So why are you going to see “The Social Network”?
John H. Campbell: I’ve got a great answer for this one—Mark Zuckerberg actually stayed in my room his freshman year.
RR: And how do you think this movie will portray Zuckerberg?
JHC: Well, I mean he got sued and lost and the trailer kind of makes him seem like a scumbag.
RR: Do you think that’s fair?
Matthew M. McCarthy: It’s a movie, you’ve gotta do it.
RR: What do you think will be the biggest difference between movie Harvard and real Harvard?
JHC: Movie Harvard’s way more fun.
Kevin J. Wu: Movie Harvard probably has less homework.
RR: You don’t think the people at movie Harvard will be more attractive?
KJW: That’s a good point.
MMM: Yeah. I wanted to say it but I didn’t want to say it.
RR: Someone had to.
 
Daniel H. Nevius ’11
RR: Final clubs play a pretty big role in the movie, how do you think that they’ll be portrayed?
Daniel H. Nevius: I think that they’ll be exaggerated a little bit, just from what I’ve seen in the previews. They kind of over-do them, talk them up a bit, make them seem cooler than they actually are.
RR: You didn’t punch?
DHN: Oh yeah, a couple of them.
Sanjay P. Misra ’12
RR: How do you think this movie will make Zuckerberg look?
Sanjay P. Misra: Uh, probably like an asshole.
RR: Do you think that he deserves an honorary degree from Harvard?
SPM: No, he’s got enough. He should have to come back to graduate.
RR: Would you rather be friends with Facebook Zuckerberg or MySpace Tom?
SPM: I mean, aren’t I already friends with both?
Ricardo C. Robledo ’14
RR: What do you think the biggest difference between actual Harvard students and their Hollywood counterparts will be?
Ricardo C. Robledo: Movie Harvard people will be super, super smart and super, super snotty. I mean we’re super smart but in a more humble way. I don’t know, you can’t tell by looking at us.
RR: How would you describe Harvard final clubs and parties?
RCR: We get pretty wild.
RR: What would you normally be doing right now?
RCR: Studying.
RR: Yeah, I see what you mean about the wild part.

“I like it on my desk,” Okeoma C. Nwakanma '13 wrote as her Facebook status.
“I like it unzipped for easy access,” wrote Michelle Ran ’13 as hers.
“I like it hanging on the back of my chair :) ,” wrote Abby P. Sun ’13.
Perhaps you’ve noticed statuses like these three filling up your Facebook news feed in the past day or so?
These statuses, which begin with “I like it” (allegedly referring to a purse) and end with personalized statements, are an attempt to raise breast cancer awareness and attract attention.
“I think these statuses are a very clever way to raise breast cancer awareness,” said Bay B. McCulloch ’12, who also posted an “I like it” status on her Facebook. “They’re something people will remember.”
Several students noted that they didn’t at first understand why their Facebook friends were posting these statuses but posted their own after learning the updates’ connection to breast cancer.
“At first I thought it was a bunch of people making bad sexual innuendos,” wrote Ran in an e-mail. “Then a friend told me it was about purses. Then another person mentioned it was about breast cancer.”
These statuses may have been confusing, but at least you know that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month now!

To continue our series from Monday, here are the profiles of the women’s final clubs.
To  date, Harvard has five female final clubs, the youngest of which was  founded just two years ago. Although significantly newer than their  male counterparts—not to mention with smaller endowments—these  organizations nevertheless provide one kind of social outlet for women  on campus. Given that most club representatives chose to remain  tight-lipped when we contacted them for this feature, we instead combed  through The Crimson’s archives for some basic facts.
Bee Club
Date founded: 1981
Location: 45 Dunster St.
Brief history: According to this 1998 Crimson article, the first iteration of the Bee was created during the  Civil War, when a group of Cambridge women formed a  sewing bee—a circle of women who would gather every week to sew and  mend uniforms for the Union soldiers. Over a century later, when a group of women at Harvard wanted to create their own final club, they adopted the name "the Bee." "The ambition of the club is not be elitist," a member told The Crimson in 1998. "It's ambition is to be the exact opposite." A punch quoted in the same article, however, saw it as "an extension of a New York all-girls prep school." This year, though, the club decided to allow the friends of punches to attend gatherings, too.
Isis Club
Date founded: 2000
Location: Rented space in the Owl Club
Brief history: The Isis aims to bring Harvard women together "for the purpose of building friendships and a strong system of support on campus and in the world beyond," according to its mission statement. Not too long ago, the club became famous for accidentally making its e-mail archives accessible to the public, revealing information about its punch evaluations, dues, and other secrets.
Pleiades Society
Date founded: 2002
Brief history: The Pleiades, which The Crimson referred to as “neither final club nor sorority” in 2002, was named for the group of seven sisters who were  known for their beauty. As the story goes, the hunter Orion was so smitten with the sisters that he asked Zeus for help in escaping his  affection for them. Zeus obliged, turning the sisters into doves that flew into the sky and became a constellation of stars.
Sablière Society
Date founded: 2002
Brief history: The Sablière is named for Marguerite de la Sablière, a 17th-century patron of La Fontaine, who turned her house into a meeting place for the literati from the court of Louis XIV. According to this Crimson article, the club focuses on taking advantage of the intellectual, cultural, and artistic aspects of Boston. “We’re not advocating a keg in a small basement, but rather cocktails on the Common or wine at the MFA,” co-founder Brooke L. Chavez '04 told The Crimson in 2002.
La Vie Club
Date founded: 2008
Brief history: In a Crimson article from this spring, Dara A. B. Johnson '10 recalled the creation of her  organization: "On a cold winter day in January 2008, I decided that it  was time to take an active step towards bridging the gender inequality  gap that exists in the Harvard social scene." Johnson said that La Vie’s  motto is the same as her own: “la vie en rose.”
