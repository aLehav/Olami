Trigger warning: Sexual assault, family separation
To say that “The Last Ceremony” is an emotional rollercoaster would be an understatement. Right off the bat, the show brings back the ceremony for the first time this season. Emily (Alexis Bledel) is raped in the new household she is assigned to after returning from the Colonies. When her rapist collapses shortly thereafter, his wife asks for Emily’s help as she continues to lie on her back on the bed. “Chances are better [of conceiving] if I lay on my back afterwards,” she says, matter-of-factly. Her robotic response is an unexpected tonal shift in how “The Handmaid’s Tale” typically depicts the assaults that constitute the ceremonies—coldly, distantly, imbuing them with an underlying barbarity made all the more disturbing in the act’s normalization—which is why it’s even more horrific when, 25 minutes later, Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) holds June (Elisabeth Moss) down as Commander Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) brutally rapes her in order to “naturally” induce June’s labor.
It’s a far cry from how last week’s preview hinted the episode would go. For a few minutes, the characters—even June—are fooled into thinking June has gone into labor, though it turns out she was only suffering from Braxton Hicks contractions. At one point, pre-bubble-bursting, the camera zooms in on Serena from the overhead lights, stroking her flat stomach. Strahovski’s expression says it all, her face awash with all the wonder and anticipation and hope that comes with becoming a new mother. It’s a look she rarely wears, which is why it’s all the more jarring to see her return almost immediately to her usual scowl when her dreams are dashed. Only this time around, her jaw is a bit more locked, her eyes more pinched, her lips more downturned. There’s a brilliant moment when her eyes meet June’s as she strokes the very swollen stomach Serena so wishes was hers, and June’s supreme satisfaction becomes palpable. In that moment, her smugness at having hurt Serena and being able to keep her baby just a little while longer, even in a way that is completely out of her control, clashes with Serena’s desperate anger. It’s a testament to both actresses’ skill. The tension is palpable for everyone—the wives, the handmaids, and the audience alike.
And yet, it cannot compare to either of the episode’s two biggest moments. Director Jeremy Podeswa does not shy away from showing the assault in all its horror, cutting between high shots of June’s terrified and devastated face, closeups of Waterford and Serena whispering words from the Bible to each other, and overhead shots of the scene in its entirety. At key points, the shot/scene slows down, the camera zooming in on Serena’s hand clenched tightly around June’s wrist, for example. And at the end of it all, June lies prostrate, her face turned away from the camera, with all sound quieting down. The shot composition is subtle, but poignant. With June at the bottom of the screen, but also the focal point of the shot, Podeswa centers her at the center of the show, with Waterford’s silhouette blurred above her in the background, alluding to his ubiquitous, menacing presence in June’s life. The scene combines all the horror, misogyny, and violence of “The Handmaid’s Tale” into one awful moment, a sharp reminder that, although June’s pregnancy has thus far protected her from the punishment she surely would have gotten otherwise for her insolence, it cannot protect her from what Gilead is fundamentally founded on.
That’s why it’s all the more dissonant that Waterford gives June what he believes she “deserves,” a precious ten minutes with her daughter Hannah (Jordana Blake), from whom she was forcibly separated for three years. “Did you try to find me?” the young girl, renamed Agnes, asks. “Why didn’t you try harder?” Not the reunion you were hoping for? Writer Yahlin Chang did a lot of research into how reunions between parents and children go after lengthy forced separations. “I talked to social workers, child psychologists, and people at the U.N…  It never goes the way the mom wants it to go. So you have this idea that you and the child are going to run to hug each other, and it’s all going to be amazing. They said the child would usually be overwhelmed and scared,” she said in an interview with Digital Trends. The dialogue reflects that research, which is eerily and disturbingly reminiscent of the situation so many families find themselves in under Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. In such an emotionally turbulent episode as this, it’s hard to imagine how much more real “The Handmaid’s Tale” can get. Overloaded with both heartbreak and horror, the episode packs too much into one hour, becoming overwhelming in its content. One can only hope that June still has the strength to reach for the freedom she’s so desperately fought for.

Note: This review contains spoilers.
It’s June (Elisabeth Moss) versus the wilderness in “Holly,” the eleventh episode of the second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” There’s nothing like a change of scenery to refresh “The Handmaid’s Tale” for loyal audiences who may be bored of Gilead’s constancy, something the writers know as they continue teasing us with trips to Canada or treks into forests. But this cycle of visiting the outside world only to return to Gilead’s borders is getting tiresome. At this point, June just needs to get the hell out already.
And she’s definitely trying to. “Holly” starts with June all alone in the snow. It’s less of a winter wonderland and more of a freezing nightmare. This episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale” makes a welcome venture out of its genre, feeling like a Jack London novel as June faces off against a wolf, a rather clumsy metaphor for the inherent wildness in human nature. Or, a psychological thriller when the Waterfords search for June throughout the house. June tiptoes around the mansion with a shotgun in hand, trying to evade her captors in an exceptionally intense scene.
After these initial obstacles, June now has to go up against mother nature in two ways. First, the snow is blocking her shiny getaway car’s exit. Second, she’s enormously pregnant. Eventually, mother nature wins as the snow refuses to melt and June starts going into labor. She gives up, fires the shotgun into the air as a rescue call, and goes inside the house to give birth.
This is where the narrative fails. Again and again, we’ve been baited with the potential for change in this handmaid’s story. And again and again, the story ends up back where it started. June gets chained to a bed after failing to complete a perilous journey into Canada. Commander Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) continues his reign of terror over his household after Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) gives herself and June a little bit of literary independence. It’s entirely frustrating, making these glimpses of change non-cathartic and weightless.
That being said, there are pieces of the story—the released handmaid letters, Canada’s new, non-diplomatic stance with Gilead, Serena Joy’s newfound defiance—that could change the game. But they have yet to have any impact on the show’s plot progression. Perhaps the writers behind “The Handmaid’s Tale” are saving them for an explosive penultimate episode and finale? But even if they are, it’s questionable whether or not the last two episodes will have enough bandwidth to resolve all of the anticipation this season has been building.
