After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s an understatement to say that modern science has been the most transformative tool in the human toolkit over the last millennium. From our transportation systems to our digital playthings, we are a society built on the shoulders of science.
We are also a society that has embraced this tool with passion. In elementary school I remember memorizing the scientific method, admiring the genius of Isaac Newton and Marie Curie, and watching with awe my first science experiment, a baking soda and vinegar volcano. STEM education is the stated center of U.S. education policy. News outlets, responding to public demand, now regularly utilize the statistics and studies that their forebears once flippantly labeled nerd-stuff. And wherever we go, we encounter technology, each device quietly advertising to us the power of this tool we call science.
Yet, as (somebody other than, it turns out) Mark Twain famously put it, “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” And thus, amidst this science-oriented backdrop, the doctrine of scientism — “the promotion of science as the best or only objective means by which society should determine normative and epistemological values” — has emerged. It has done so throughout society, but especially in the most significantly exposed segment of the population, the younger generations, the longer educated, and the less religious. We’ve internalized our cultural love of science so that we increasingly tend towards believing that human knowledge is driven by science and science alone, that most questions need to be answered empirically, and that most phenomena can be explained with sufficiently complex physical accounts.
The first problematic symptom of scientism we can identify is the scorn that it often engenders for other modes of thinking. The religious arena best illuminates this scorn. At some point we all probably have seen, or have been, the person who confidently bashes on religion for having no evidence behind it. “Evidence” needs no adjective — for of course it is only evidence of the scientific sort that counts. And thus the ship of scientism leaves behind the religious, with an amused chuckle and a petulant puff of steam. My point here is less to initiate a metaphysical conversation about god/God than it is to illustrate how our scientism often precludes us from even getting to a starting point for such a conversation.
This same attitude possesses conversations that deal with topics like free will, morality, the nature of the mind, and the nature of gender. These questions do not ask for experiments but for reason, for examples and analogies, for theories of the meanings of words, for hypotheticals and counterfactuals, for powerful explanations, and for reflections on our own lived experiences. Yet our capacity and propensity to think along these lines fade as we become more and more convinced that truth in this world can be reduced to science. We become mired in the kind of thinking that says free will and morality cannot exist in an entirely physical universe, and that minds and gender can be reduced to the physical processes underlying them. We skip the humanities for the hard sciences, supposedly the only place where real, productive thinking takes place.
Scientism cuts deeper, however, in the way that it inherently devalues the individual. It denies the capabilities of an individual mind, and the meaning of an individual existence, thus cultivating repressed cynicism about the world.
We see this cynicism manifested in individuals’ pessimism in their ability to take a position on an issue. For as powerful a tool as science is, it is also selectively wielded, by academia, by large corporations, by the government. The individual is excluded from the truth-finding process. Thus the phrase “I don’t know enough to have an opinion” rolls freely and quickly off tongues, preempting the important processes of individual reasoning and reflection. Conversations start and end with a Google search that either revealed the answer science gave us or didn’t. The skeptical position becomes the thoughtful one, even as it entails almost no thought.
By devaluing the ways in which individuals derive meaning, scientism also contributes to a dangerous moral cynicism, not so much on the hot-button topics but on the more quotidian acts concerning morality — white lies, stereotyping, keeping promises, working hard, authenticity and the like. At its worst, scientism denies any form of meaningful justification — the religious, the cultural, the philosophical — for these norms and casts them as wholly arbitrary cultural artifacts. Where is the science to say that we should conform to these norms, it prompts. At best, it allows for a coarsely utilitarian view of them, the sort of easy “greater good” thinking that on the ground level almost always loses out to human selfishness.
In either case, scientism undermines the force of these moral norms. We may play along, depending on the strength of other behavior-shaping factors. But societies tend to slowly phase out the things they have stopped respecting.
Science is not going anywhere, nor should it. It is the greatest tool for understanding the world we humans have developed, and the innovation and improvements in our lives that it has brought should be duly respected. But we would all do well to not let this respect evolve into scientism. Because ultimately — a powerful hammer though science may be — the world is much more than just nails.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Studying in the United States had made me desensitized to the traces of the Japanese colonization of Korea that I see all the time back home. Without the recurring news on the latest developments in the drawn-out trade war between Korea and Japan, or the history lessons I had growing up that drilled into my mind the pain that my people endured during the occupation, it became difficult for me to be fixated on the past. For this reason, the shock I felt when I came across a certain poster advertising Hist 1023: Japan in Asia and the World in the Center for Government and International Studies was greater than ever.
It clearly stood out among the numerous other posters on the wall — it showed the image of a red sun on a white background, with its deep red rays covering over half of the poster. I immediately recognized that the image on the poster was the Japanese imperial flag, otherwise known as the Rising Sun flag. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at.
The Rising Sun flag is often likened to the Nazi Swastika, and rightfully so. It was used as a flag of war, officially made the war flag of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1870. The flag reminds especially Chinese and Korean people of the horrors of Japanese occupation. The Japanese imperialists’ crimes against humanity include forced labor, gruesome medical experiments on innocent people, and forced prostitution. The Rising Sun flag became a flashpoint of tension during the Beijing Olympics  and other major sporting events. FIFA has also instituted a ban on the flag at international football matches in response to South Korean protests. As such, the flag is internationally recognized as divisive, if not downright offensive.
On a campus that strives to be politically correct and hesitate from making any statement that may offend a certain ethnic group to even the slightest extent, I was left in shock by the blatant disregard for Japan’s crimes against humanity that the History Department demonstrated in allowing this image to be used in promotional materials. The Rising Sun flag may be widespread and symbolic in Japan, but this in no way means that the crimes against humanity associated with the flag’s symbolization of Japanese imperialism should be ignored. Harvard is home to a considerable amount of Asian students, and the Class of 2023 is 25.3 percent Asian American. Even if the offensive nature of the Rising Sun flag is not widely known, to display a poster with the flag in a public space is grossly disrespectful to the Asian population at Harvard. What makes matters worse is the fact that the Rising Sun flag was used as a promotional image for a class on Japan.
Considering how Japan refuses to directly acknowledge its war crimes, using the Rising Sun flag as a representation of Japan is deeply troubling. The matter is left unresolved even today, with the Korean Supreme Court ruling demanding Japanese firms to compensate for the victims of forced labor during World War II leading to a trade war as well as soured relationships between Korean and Japanese people. With the shadow of Japanese war crimes continuing to affect Chinese and Korean people today, the Rising Sun flag is a painful and cruel reminder that the victims of Japan’s atrocities have yet to be fully compensated.
I know my perceptions of Japan may be somewhat biased because of the Korea-centric history I learned growing up. But, history is history. Leaving biases aside, the historical record of Japanese atrocities in Korea and China during WWII remains. The Rising Sun flag is a symbol of Japanese imperialism that took away countless lives of the innocent — that alone justifies its inappropriateness. The History Department and the teaching staff of History 1023 should acknowledge their mistake in some format, raising awareness of the offensiveness of displaying the Rising Sun flag in public. That this poster did not generate a huge outcry on campus does not absolve them from blame. Ignorance of history and its cultural connotations will only lead to more ignorance and hurt.

Between teaching section, working in high-powered laboratories, and writing dissertations on everything from wood chip mulches to pavement performance in crosswalk designs, many graduate students at Harvard struggle to make Harvard’s Student Health Insurance Plan meet their health needs. In particular, caps on specialist and mental health consultations from outside providers force some students — admittedly less than one percent — to choose between high out-of-pocket payments and foregoing individualized medical care.
Healthcare, particularly on Harvard’s campus for those enrolled in SHIP, can be incredibly challenging to navigate. In particular, forcing students to choose between important medical procedures or face massive out of pocket costs is deeply troubling. We have previously opined, with regard to healthcare at the undergraduate level, that the University, through Harvard University Health Services, should reflect on the healthcare knowledge of the students it covers — both in terms of specific coverage as well as broader principles of personal health management.
If you’re not well-versed in the world of healthcare benefits, you might not know that Harvard’s health insurance program is different, in that it is self-funded. As such, it avoids subjection to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which requires insurers to provide equal mental and physical health benefits.
So while SHIP may be legally compliant, Harvard still must consider whether its coverage model can be considered to be ethical. M. Susan Ridgely, a senior health policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, has agreed that while legal, SHIP raises ethical questions about what it should achieve with regard to coverage. We share Ridgely’s suspicion.
Graduate students provide so much to our campus, not least in their contributions to research and instruction, that we believe it is in everyone’s best interests if they can perform their work as unimpeded as possible by burdensome healthcare and financial concerns. We hope that the ongoing negotiations between Harvard and the University’s graduate student union prove fruitful in this regard. Both sides must work for a fair and equitable agreement regarding SHIP that protects the health of grad students on our campus without putting them under undue financial stress.
Most policymakers would agree that our healthcare system is far from perfect. Healthcare outcomes in America lag significantly behind those in other similarly developed nations even as the US spends much more as a percentage of gross domestic product. A lack of broad and inclusive coverage as well as navigational guidance is one big reason why.
Harvard should be at the forefront of answering these questions, not lagging behind its peer institutions on student coverage and ease-of-use. As the union negotiations continue, Harvard should take a moment to reconsider and hopefully revise its policies. How can Harvard lead the way in healthcare innovation — not least at its renowned school of public health — if it doesn’t first take care of the students who make that intellectual work possible?

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an interview Thursday he is “deeply disappointed” by the lack of progress the University has made in combating sexual misconduct after a recent climate survey found Harvard’s incident rate remained unchanged after four years.
Administered nationwide in April, the Association of American Universities surveyed 33 schools and collected data from 180,000 students, with slightly more than 8,300 Harvard students participating.
The survey found roughly 33 percent of undergraduate women at Harvard reported having experienced some form of nonconsensual sexual contact, up from 31 percent of senior undergraduate women in 2015 who reported experiencing some form of sexual assault.
Garber said he is “grateful” for the AAU for administering the survey and called the data “immensely valuable,” but also acknowledged that the results are concerning.
“These issues are of deep, deep concern to us, “ Garber said. “I am deeply disappointed by the lack of dramatic progress in areas of such deep concern.”
After the survey’s first iteration in 2015, the University set out to reform its Title IX programming. In 2017, administrators split the Title IX Office in two, separating those who handle sexual misconduct complaints and those who provide Title IX training and resources. The University has also institutionalized mandatory training for students, faculty, and staff.
As the rate of those who reported experiencing some form of sexual misconduct remained stagnant, 50 percent of undergraduate women and 75 percent of undergraduate men said they felt it was very or extremely likely that a campus official would take their Title IX report seriously.
Garber said that though the data is disappointing, it does not dictate how the University should change its policies.
“I have to point out that the AAU survey and most surveys of its type are designed to capture, to give us a snapshot, of different points in time of what's going on in this arena,” he said. “They are not really designed to tell us what approaches to intervention will be most effective.”
Garber also pointed out that the survey may not reflect more recent initiatives, including recently instituted bystander training. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview earlier this month that he would look to pilot new forms of bystander training with the Office of Sexaul Assault Prevention and Response.
“The thing that you should keep in mind when interpreting the results is that we haven't had bystander training in place for all that long. And it may be that it will take some years to see dramatic change in some of these measures,” Garber said. “And I don't say that as an excuse. I say that to point out that we shouldn't lose faith that some of these interventions might work even if we don't see the evidence just yet.”
Other University officials have also shared their disappointment with the results.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates announcing the survey results that they were “profoundly disturbing” and the issue was not something that just leadership should deal with, but rather it is an issue for people across the University.
“We must do better,” he wrote.
Garber invoked Bacow’s comments in the Thursday interview and said it is on everyone at Harvard to try and “change culture.” He said he is working with administrators examine the data and propose new initiatives going forward.
“The Title IX office, the deans, and many other people throughout the university, are in the midst of analyzing and digesting the AAU survey results with an eye toward improving every aspect of how we approach this extremely important problem,” Garber said.

Harvard’s graduate student union released a voting guide Thursday that includes information about candidates running in the upcoming municipal elections in Cambridge, Somerville, and Boston, which take place Nov. 5.
Thirty-two candidates from the three cities responded to the union’s questionnaire, which posed yes-no questions and offered opportunities for write-in answers. The candidates in different jurisdictions received different versions of the survey tailored to issues relevant to their constituents.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers released a similar handbook in 2017, before the last municipal election. Each of the cities operate on a bi-annual election schedule.
Union organizer and Harvard Divinity School student Samuel D. Keaser, who helped put together this year’s guide, said that the purpose of creating it was to make sure union members and other Harvard voters are aware of the candidates' positions on a “range of issues,” in particular, the rights of student union members.
Keaser highlighted the survey questions that probed support for student workers’ rights to organize and strike. The survey also included questions about HGSU’s efforts to create a third-party sexual harassment and discrimination incident adjudication process. The survey questioned whether the candidates opposed the National Labor Relations Board’s proposed rule last month that would essentially reverse a 2016 decision that allowed graduate students at private universities to unionize.
All the candidates who replied stated they supported the union’s rights and opposed the proposed NLRB rule.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the survey questions about unionization.
Members of the Cambridge and Boston city councils have recently weighed in on HGSU issues. Cambridge City Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and E. Denise Simmons spoke at a HGSU rally in March. In April, the council unanimously passed a policy order supporting the union’s calls for increased compensation and backed them on other issues on the bargaining table.
In June, HGSU members testified at a Boston City Council hearing sponsored by Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards to give union members a chance to discuss the statuses of the unions at their respective schools.
Keaser said he hopes the candidates — even those who lose — continue to use the “platform that they have” to support HGSU through public comments and policy proposals.
The voter guide also addressed affordable housing and whether candidates would support a proposed affordable housing zoning overlay. Some survey respondents argued that Harvard has contributed to the housing problem in the city. Cambridge candidate Charles J. Franklin said the University is “part of the problem,” as they do not provide “adequate housing for students.”
“I am in favor of denying them any future building permits or upzoning requests until they build more housing for their students,” he said.
In August, the University announced it was recommitting to a $20 million program to facilitate affordable housing development in Cambridge and the greater Boston area. Since 2000, this fund has helped create more than 1,600 units of affordable housing in the city, according to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke. She wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard houses nearly all of its undergraduates on campus and has the capacity to house nearly half of its graduate students.
Proposed before the council in early 2019, the controversial affordable housing overlay saw months of fiery debate from councilors, residents, and candidates before being tabled until next term.
The voter guide also addressed Harvard’s role in combating climate change, which has become a significant issue in the council election.
Several candidates reiterated their calls for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. In the guide, Mayor Marc C. McGovern said he is “proud” he joined Divest Harvard in recent demonstrations for divestment.
“We must work with Harvard, push Harvard, and demand that Harvard do its part part in addressing climate change, and it starts with their divestment from fossil fuels,” he said.
O’Rourke wrote that the University is “acting aggressively” to address climate change and noted that University President Lawrence S. Bacow, as well as members of the Harvard Corporation, have met with divestment advocates several times, most recently last week.
O’Rourke added that the University maintains “meaningful partnerships” with Cambridge and Boston.
“Harvard is modeling the pathway to a healthier, fossil-free future,” she wrote.
Keaser said the guide is an important piece of HGSU’s contribution to Harvard’s “civic life. ”
“In addition to being Harvard graduate student workers, and undergraduate student workers, we're all parts of these communities,” he said. “One of our main hopes with this, too, is just that students and workers have that option and ability to access and engage with their communities in a more real way.”

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council passed legislation at its meeting Sunday to support the University’s graduate student union’s right to strike.
In a statement approved 40-1, the council endorsed the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers 90.4 percent vote in favor of strike authorization, which was passed late Friday night.
“This is a strong mandate to make sure the first union contract for student workers guarantees protections against harassment and discrimination, fair pay, paid parental leave, and health care with year-round mental health and dental coverage,” the statement reads.
The statement also invited undergraduates to sign a letter declaring support should union negotiators decide to call for a strike. Earlier this month, the UC supported HGSU’s strike authorization vote prior to the vote's passage.
Earlier this month, HGSU announced it would hold a strike authorization vote, which would give the union’s bargaining committee the right to declare a strike if it sees fit. The union has been bargaining with the University for more than a year. While the two sides have reached tentative agreements on 11 issues, they remain at odds on compensation and harassment and discrimination adjudication procedures.
The University has advised faculty members to prepare for a potential strike, but University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard does not believe the union’s calls for a strike have merit.
“The University believes that calls for a strike are unwarranted,” he wrote. “The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and has offered substantive proposals that address the concerns raised by HGSU-UAW throughout these negotiations.”
The council also plans to publicize a letter written by Our Harvard Can Do Better — an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization — addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 supporting HGSU’s right to strike in its weekly email newsletter.
“We recognize and affirm the importance of using a strike as a measure of last resort to win a fair contract,” the letter reads. “We stand in solidarity with our fellow students and will join all student workers on the picket lines if needed until they win the protections and benefits they so deserve. Teaching and research assistants’ working conditions are students’ learning conditions.”
Mather House representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, who sponsored the legislation, wrote in the proposal that publicizing the letter would help inform undergraduates about the strike.
“[T]he Undergraduate Council’s endorsement and publicization of a student support letter would help ensure that undergraduate students are informed about an important component of the union process and can be part of the push toward better provisions if they would like,” she wrote.
No representatives offered comments against the legislation during Sunday’s meeting.
The UC also voted to co-host an open forum on sexual violence at Harvard in collaboration with Our Harvard Can Do Better.
The forum is largely in response to the results of a national sexual misconduct climate survey that revealed that sexual assault rates at Harvard remain largely unchanged from four years ago, according to UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20, who sponsored the legislation. The survey found that roughly 33 percent of undergraduate women at Harvard reported experiencing nonconsesual sexual contact.
“In light of the [Association of American Universities] Student Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct results that we all received last week, Our Harvard Can Do Better and the UC are seeking to create a student-led space where undergraduate community members can feel safe and empowered to express their feelings, thoughts, and reactions to the survey data as well as the problem of sexual violence at Harvard more generally, and discuss steps forward,” the legislation reads.
The forum will be held in the Lowell House Junior Common Room from 6:30-8 p.m. on Oct. 30, Huesa said.
The UC also allocated $3,450 to help fund the East Coast Chicanx Student Forum on Nov. 15. The conference will discuss the Chicano movements of the 1970s and diversity within the Chicanx community, according to the legislation.

University Professor Danielle S. Allen received a 2019 Governor's Award at the annual Massachusetts Humanities Dinner Sunday evening.
Allen, the director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard, was chosen for the award by the Mass Humanities Board of Directors and confirmed by Governor Charlie D. Baker, Jr. ’79.
Sunday’s award dinner was hosted at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, and followed a free public forum featuring Allen in conversation with Harvard History professor Jill Lepore about the importance of history in democracy.
Elizabeth A. Duclos-Orsello, Dinner Committee co-chair and vice chair of the Board of Directors, said in an interview that the organization chose Allen as an “exemplar” of connecting civic engagement with the principles of humanities.
“Danielle Allen is someone whose professional life has been dedicated to thinking about how to take what often seem as big complicated ideas that sometimes get locked away in the academy and bring them to the public in ways that make them meaningful and that encourage other people to see that they have — they are actors in this messy, crazy thing we call an American democracy,” Duclos-Orsello said.
The evening began with a reception and dinner, followed by the award presentation that featured a brief montage of Allen’s accomplishments. She then offered short remarks to the crowd.
“The work itself has always been its own reward,” Allen said. “No one ever regrets accepting the invitation to bring the best of our human capacities, to make unique of common human trials.”
Event attendee Nichole A. Turpin said Allen demonstrates the unique ability to connect her scholarship to everyday people.
“She’s relatable and understandable on a level that makes everyone feel like they’re belonging in the space that she’s making, which I think is really needed at this time,” Turpin said.
Mass Humanities’ leadership also applauded Allen for her contributions to the Clemente Course in the Humanities. Funded by Mass Humanities, the Clemente program was started in 1995 to teach art, philosophy, and literature to adult students who would not otherwise afford this type of education.
Mass Humanities Executive Director Brian W. Boyles said Allen worked for the program early in her career while teaching at the University of Chicago.
“She taught that course twice a week in the evenings to people who didn't have access to the humanities traditionally, and I think that that's been a spirit of her work,” Boyles said in an interview.
Allen said in an interview at the reception that teaching Clemente classes was among the “most important teaching experiences of my life” and that she had been a supporter of Mass Humanities for more than two decades because of the organization’s continued advocacy for the Clemente program in Massachusetts.
“It matters a lot to me that Mass Humanities was one of the first humanities councils to support Clemente,” she said. “They rest on a vision that every person should have equal access to the cultural wealth of the humanities.”
Looking forward from this honor, Allen said she plans to continue her work at the intersection of humanities and democracy.
“I think doing the same thing I'm already doing, which is that in whatever ways I have available to me, I seek to support the cause of democracy and make sure we can pass on a healthy flourishing democracy to future generations,” she said.

Katie Benzan ‘20, Harvard’s starting point guard for the past three seasons, confirmed that she will play for the University of Texas at Austin upon graduation for the 2020-2021 season.
At the end of August, The Crimson reported that Benzan would forgo her senior year season.
“Katie has been a remarkable player in our program for three years,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said in an emailed statement. “After much discussion with the coaching staff, she has decided to step away her senior year.”
On Saturday, Benzan posted photos on Instagram sporting a No. 11 Longhorns burnt orange jersey.
Benzan wrote in a message to the Crimson that she has a verbal commitment from the University of Texas at Austin as of now and will formally sign a letter of intent during the signing period around mid-November.
Per NCAA Division I rules, a graduate student is eligible to compete in intercollegiate athletics provided that she has one season of competition remaining, according to the NCAA Division Manual.
In her three seasons playing for The Crimson, Benzan shattered school records.
Her freshman season, she set the record for most three pointers made in a season with 85. She went on to break her own record twice, finishing last season with 103 made threes. Her superlative skill from three point range enabled her to set the all-time Ivy League record, what was previously 273, for career three pointers made in only three seasons. She ended her career with 287 triples scored.
Also in her final season for the Crimson, Benzan became the 20th Crimson player to score 1,000 points. In addition to her prolific scoring, Benzan led the Crimson in assists all three seasons.
The Longhorns finished the 2018-2019 season with a record of 23-10. The team, which competes in the Big 12 Conference, ended its season with a loss in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, which marked the sixth consecutive and 32nd all time Tournament appearance in the program’s history.
University of Texas at Austin Head Coach Karen Aston offered a window into the culture of Longhorns women’s basketball in a press conference on September 30.
“There’s a standard here at Texas and more importantly we have our own standard within our program...The one thing I think people really enjoy is how my girls play the game and how we project as far as competitiveness and passion,” she said.
Senior forward Jeannie Boehm spoke confidently that Benzan will be able to adjust to Longhorn basketball, which she noted has a “different style of play” in a “different conference” than Harvard.
“Katie’s obviously a great player...I think all great players know how to adjust,” she said. “It will definitely be super different, but you know, great players are great.”

With the leaves turning beautiful shades of orange, yellow, and ~crimson~, most students bust out their warmest scarves, fuzziest socks, and pumpkin spice lattes. With the crisp October days coming to a close, however, some students know that a picturesque Harvard Yard means spooky season is now well underway. Here are some last-minute ways you and your roommates can make your suite the most boo-tiful of them all:
Fairy lights
Let’s be honest, telling scary ghost stories under the pale glow of those wobbly silver floor lamps doesn’t make for the most thrilling night-in. If you really want to set the mood, you need heaps and heaps of string lights everywhere. Amazon, Target, or Walmart are your one-stop shops for cheap lights online.
Pumpkins
Make a day of this one with your roomies by stopping by pumpkin patches at Allandale Farm, Honey Pot Hill Orchards, or Westward Orchards for an Instagram-worthy autumnal day. If your Gcal doesn’t allow for such an excursion out of the Harvard bubble, stop by the Science Center Plaza Farmer’s Market on a Tuesday to pick up a pumpkin or two before they’re gone for good.
Fake spiderwebs
To maximize the scare factor in spooky season, you can’t go wrong with a few cobwebs strewn about the room. They’re a simple Halloween-esque addition, and hey, at least it’ll be a bit more fitting the next time you see that little spider on the wall by your dresser. Order a few bags of cotton batting online and get creative!
Door decorations
This is an easy way to let your hallmates know you’re serious about this time of year. To keep it classic, you can easily find some mini skeletons or ghosts online to hang on your door. If you want to really “trick or treat yo’ self,” get a chalkboard sign so others can see you’re just “creepin it real” by displaying the great Halloween puns that didn’t make the Instagram caption cut.
Window Post-its
If you feel like splurging a little at Staples, stock up on fun colored Post-it notes and let your inner Halloween fanatic run wild. Try spelling out cute messages or more Halloween puns for the tourists’ viewing pleasure. Better yet, use those Post-its to create geometric images of scary ghosts, moonlit pumpkin patches, or Remy the cat…the possibilities are endless.
Even with dangerously low bank accounts and booked schedules, it’s never impossible to deck out your dorm for the Halloween season. Hopefully this list will get you started on all the cheap and fun ways you can make your suite look wicked awesome. Happy Halloween!
