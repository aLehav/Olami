After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Ten seconds into “Intro,” drummer Stella Mozgawa, out of sync with guitarist Theresa Wayman, cuts out, yelling “Ah, sorry!” and casually counting off the tempo on her sticks before the entire group comes in together. This opening to Warpaint’s eponymous second album is reminiscent of Bob Dylan’s “115th Dream”; both tracks serve to make the listener aware of the complex entity that is a live band. For Dylan, the inclusion of the botched-and-then-patched beginning is his departure from self-strummed acoustics and a declaration of his new group’s tightness. Warpaint’s statement is more measured: in an indie-rock landscape where highly produced digital elements, particularly those derived from EDM, are integral to innovation, Warpaint is intrigued but still achingly human. Accordingly, on their second LP, the group augments their intimate instrumental sound with unexpected stylistic subtleties to craft consistently beautiful and provocative songs of love and loss.
 
“Warpaint” is still a far more produced album than the group’s debut, “The Fool,” which hardly touched the drum loops, synthesizers, vocal ambience, and overdubs that often appear on their new album. Producer Flood, famed for his ability to incorporate electronic elements into the recorded work of virtuosic rock players, sprinkles the record with subtle effects. In “Hi,” a simultaneously melodic and throbbingly rhythmic track that is arguably the best on the album, a trip-hoppy drum loop underscores the opening verse. Yet just as it seems that the beat will accompany the entirety of the song, Mozgawa reemerges with a strikingly odd fill. The deviation from the loop is so subtle that the most pressing question is not “How did they incorporate that effect?” but rather, “Was that an effect?”
 
Flood’s treatment of lead singer Emily Kokal’s voice on “Hi” is just as restrained. At first, intense reverb accompanies the end of each ethereal and cryptic verse, which seems to tell the story of a weak and troubled lover. The effect makes Kokel sound distant and almost robotic. As with the drums, however, this remoteness quickly disappears when a gasping breath from Kokal immediately reaffirms her humanity. Other effects work in much the same way, giving a glimpse of the computerized before pulling back to reveal an undoctored strum, breath, or drumbeat. Warpaint, resisting the urge to overuse synthetic and unexpected sounds, utilize the digital sparingly to magnify the unenhanced.
 
The increased focus on Kokal’s voice granted by the production allows the vocalist’s talent to come through. Her voice intermingles with the melodies of the instruments and sometimes acts as an instrument in itself, cooing, moaning, and slurring off of notes. The synthesizer, which often has a similar tone and timbre to Kokal’s low-vibrato lines, is sometimes indistinguishable from her singing. The track “CC,” devolves into a disorienting siren song, with the three harmonic melodies melding into a single beautiful chord. Occasionally, and most noticeably on the mellower second-side tracks “Go In” and “Son,” the synth-voice combination becomes soupy and lethargic. On the faster tracks, however, the effect is gorgeous and eerie.
 
Wayman’s guitar lines interact equally fluidly with Kokal’s timbre and melodies. In “Feeling Alright,” Kokal’s voice floats onto the root of a major chord a fraction of a second before Wayman’s lead guitar joins her, effectively transposing the song in a call-and-response fashion. There is no artificial break or musical showboating here or anywhere else on the record. The transpositions and other musical idiosyncrasies are so hidden that they only fully reveal themselves slowly through multiple listens.
 
The lack of lyrical specificity is the album’s primary weakness. Warpaint’s debut, “The Fool,” relies largely on poetic words and concepts, but is still anchored in contemporary lore, as evidenced by the popular track “Billie Holliday,” and other references to the modern. “Warpaint,” however, drops any remaining vestiges of contemporary referentiality. The album is often unanchored contextually, relying on wrenching but vague lyrics centered around the very human elements of love, betrayal, and death. By the end of the album, the lyrics fade largely into the background.
 
The lyrics that do stand out, however, are more heavily sexually tinged than those of their debut, which was by no means a puritanical album. “Biggy” has an extended outro centered on the repeated phrase “heat of a lover.” Kokal moans the words, offering up an affecting eroticism despite the dearth of directly explicit content.  Although the steamier lyrics often complement the sensual instrumental mood of the album, their opaqueness is still more distracting than beneficial. 
 
Whether “Warpaint” can emulate Dylan by continuing to grow without losing the balance between technical innovation and instrumental integrity is unclear; they certainly need to become more lyrical and find a workable aesthetic for their softer songs. For the moment, however, their ability to create raw and honest ruminations that still have a modern and unique sound is undeniably impressive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Here’s a trend to be gleaned from the past year: noisy ’90s bands are slowing down. In early 2013, My Bloody Valentine came out of hibernation with the impeccable but mellowed-out “m b v,” and autumn brought two torturously lazy EPs from the Pixies. Unlike these acts, Mogwai hasn’t split up since their 1995 nascence. But with their new release, “Rave Tapes,” the Glaswegian instrumental post-rock outfit fits right in with the rest. The album ushers in the New Year not with a bang, as the band might have done in the old days, but with a collection of mostly slow-burning compositions that add subtle new flavors to their traditional formula. Fortunately, while not without its shortcomings, “Rave Tapes” is, overall, a work marked more by maturity than fatigue.
 
When they first burst on the scene with the sometimes abrasive and always lively “Mogwai Young Team,” the group turned heads with their quick-shifting dynamics—songs would flip from whispering drones to paint-peeling power chords as if the band had hit a switch. These days, the dramatic flair has been toned down and the band is content to let more tracks simmer. Take the opener, “Heard About You Last Night.” Gentle murmuring and ethereal bells open the track before giving way to five minutes of slow-core quietude. However, the song is kept interesting by a shimmering guitar—seemingly swiped from a dream-pop song—and the occasional intervention of ghostly synths. It’s a sound not unlike that of classic Mogwai, but it’s cushioned by softer, cleaner production; and where it was once used in contrast with a heavier side, it now works on its own.
 
There may be fewer explosions on “Rave Tapes,” but there’s no lack of energy. “Remurdered” plays like the atmospheric Europop of the “Drive” soundtrack, its core components a thumping bass drum and dated-in-just-the-right-way synth sound. The cut is the album’s longest, and the band makes use of every second, looping each segment until it’s run its course before adding new layers of guitar and synths. The endpoint is almost as busy and in-your-face as an older Mogwai climax, and it feels like a natural payoff; the long metamorphosis from skeletal dance number to balls-out rocker is finally complete.
 
While the album thrives on its slow builds, it’s not free of stagnation, and many of the dullest moments happen to pop up on vocal tracks. It’s not uncommon for a Mogwai album to feature some singing, but there are more musically fulfilling ways to use the human voice than the meandering spoken-word babble on “Repelish” about satanic messages and playing records backwards. The only track with real singing, “Blues Hour,” is a more pleasant experience, incoherent lyrics notwithstanding. But “Blues Hour” only truly takes off once the vocals have finished, building into an epic two-chord jam that’s the high point of the album. The vocoder-enhanced closer, deceptively titled “The Lord is Out of Control,” is the only true vocal success, a succinct, meditative coda with a melody that haunts without overstaying its welcome.
 
It’s admittedly hard not to feel that Mogwai are missing a degree of dynamism. Vocal tracks aren’t the only parts of the album that meander, as compositions with not quite enough melodic content, like “No Medicine for Regret,” feel drawn out, while others, like “Hexon Bogon,” are promising but over too soon. On the whole, though, these lapses in excitement are just Mogwai being Mogwai. They still feel like the byproducts of an exuberant desire to explore, odd left turns by an established band that can afford to take more of them than ever before. And for all the nuance and polish that age has added to their sound, it’s important to note that Mogwai can still rock, and they do so very hard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Uncertainty is as much a part of skiing as the snow, so it was no surprise that questions regarding weather and race conditions almost threatened to cancel the Colby Winter Carnival races in Maine this weekend. Undeterred, Crimson skiers had some answers when the competition finally took place, as several athletes attained personal best times in the event.
The Harvard men’s Nordic team placed fourth and third on Friday and Saturday, respectively, in its 10K classic and 15K freestyle races. The women’s team placed fifth and 11th in its 5K classic and 10K freestyle competitions.
“It was the first carnival which we’ve been building up to for a long time and [involved] a lot of hard work over the summer and the fall,” junior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci said “We were finally able to see where we’re at compared to the rest of our competition, so it was really fun to see how we’ve been doing. We performed very well which was exciting.”
The junior explained that the week’s weather conditions partially froze Colby’s stadium, requiring another venue to be used for the races. Therefore, the men and women’s second day races were shortened and were changed to individual starts instead of scheduled mass starts.
The weather changed during the carnival as well, requiring the skiers to adapt quickly from warm, sticky snow the first day to icy, fast conditions the second.
“On the first day we just tried to ski well and get in and out of the tracks on good clean snow that wasn’t chewed up too much,” Maifeld-Carucci said. “Today was the absolute opposite. It was colder than it was supposed to be overnight so it was really icy, fast conditions. It was fun getting both sides of the spectrum for our conditions; I think it was testing conditions but everyone did well.”
The junior finished at the top for the Crimson in both races, leading the team in sixth and fifth place. Senior captain Christopher Stock was not far behind, finishing eighth and 23rd in this weekend’s carnival.
Both Maifeld-Carucci and Stock ended last season as the first two alternates for the NCAAs, and are looking to race in the tournament this coming season, along with senior captain of the women’s team Jennifer Rolfes.
“Last year [Anthony Ryerson], Akeo, and Chris Stock narrowly missed going to the NCAAs, so they all came into the season having high hopes for that,” Rolfes said. “This is definitely the start of our intense season because we’ll be on the road the next five weekends, two races each weekend and most of those are qualifiers for NCAAs.”
Top finishers on the women’s side include Rolfes, who raced her personal best times on both days and finished 18th and 23rd in the two competitions. Freshman Maile Sapp raced a personal best as well, finishing 19th in the 5K classic.
“We were really happy about [the carnival] because I think the team had some of its most consistent performances in a long time,” Rolfes said. “Maile’s [placing] was really good for a freshman, and for the boys to achieve their team goal so early in the season was really big.”
The Harvard alpine teams did not fare as well on the weekend.  The Crimson had two finishers from the women’s side and none on the men’s team in either the giant slalom or the slalom races.
“The snow conditions at Sugarloaf were really challenging,” senior captain Rebecca Nadler said. “It was very icy and bumpy. A lot of the races we came down feeling strained or uncomfortable on our skis; it was a different surface than we had ever trained on. With the challenging conditions some guys skied out of the course or lost a ski on the way down.”
Despite the challenging carnival for the alpine skiers, Nadler looks to the future and hopes to transition well into Harvard’s upcoming races beginning with next weekend’s UNH Carnival.
“I’d like to see everyone racing how they train and getting the confidence up a little more,” Nadler said. “I think results will come after that. I see a lot of good things in our training, and it can be pretty tough to replicate that in the race. There’s a top 60 cut off for the second run. Everyone on our team is definitely capable of that, but I think sometimes the race jitters get in the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first home meet of the second semester, the Harvard track and field team competed against four other local squads to earn the right to call themselves the best in Boston.
Both the men’s and women’s teams competed in the Battle for Beantown on Saturday at Gordon Indoor Track. The women’s team earned a first place finish while the men came in second. The Crimson battled teams from Boston College, Northeastern, Army, and Brown.
While the men just missed the first place spot by eight points to Army, the women won the meet by over 100 points.
“It wasn’t really what the men expected,” junior hurdler Jarvis Harris said. “Essentially the meet’s first and second place [finishes] came down to the final relays, which were the 4x800 meter relay and 4x400 meter relay. We just didn’t execute the way we wanted to, and it just happened that we came in second.”
Among top finishers was senior James Leakos in the 3000-meter, who claimed first with a time of 8:18.78. In addition, classmates Andrew Ezekoye and Damani Wilson grabbed first and second place finishes in the 60-meter dash with times of 6.81 and 6.86 seconds, respectively.
Harris ran the 60-meter hurdles in 8.13 seconds to place first, and freshman Medkim Ashebo placed second with his 22.15 time in the 200-meter dash. Harris nabbed first in the triple jump as well, with a mark of 14.28 meters.
“I felt ok about my race,” Harris said. “I wasn’t overly pleased with it, but I wasn’t upset with it. It’s the beginning of the season, so we’re just working through the meets while keeping a high level of practices during the week.”
Also in the jumping events were two second-place finishes by rookie Efe Uwaifo and sophomore Spencer Lemons in long jump and high jump, respectively. Senior Ben Glauser added to first-place finishes with his 18.67-meter mark in the weight throw.
“Our meet focuses are to apply the things we work on in practice,” Harris said. “So looking forward we’re working towards better times, especially at the meet next weekend.”
Though Harvard men’s team had many first and second place finishers, it was not enough to outrace Army’s team, and they ended the meet in second by less than ten points.
On the women’s side of the competition, the Crimson managed to place most of their team in the top places and won the meet by a wide margin.
In the high jump, freshman Reagan Nizdil took first with a jump of 1.75 meters, and teammate junior Ann Giebelhaus came in fourth with a mark of 1.65 meters.
The 60-meter hurdles was a top three sweep for Harvard, with sophomore Autumne Franklin, freshman Jackie Modesett, and classmate Jade Miller crossing the finish line in that order.
“I thought I did really well [in the meet],” Miller said. “The team had a really good day as well. Jackie and I both PR-ed in the 60-meter hurdles.”
In three other races, the 60, 200 and 500-meter dashes, the Crimson also claimed the top spots. Junior Danielle Barbian’s time of 7.53 placed her first in the 60-meter dash, with classmate Ashley Collinsworth close behind her with a time of 7.66 for second place.
Junior Gabrielle Scott ran a 25.05 for first place in the 200-meter dash. Scott also finished first in the 500-meter dash with a time of 1:13.77. In both races, Scott’s teammates were not far behind her to nab second place finishes.
“Our coach makes us have immediate goals for our races,” Miller said. “I know I need to stay taller when I run. It’s really good to have goals set while racing because it reminds you that there’s always something to improve on.”
In longer distances, a time of 2:49.72 placed junior Erika Veidis in first in her 1000-meter race. Rookie Sarah Gillespie ran the mile in 4:57.57 for a second-place finish.
“Everyone’s main goal is to learn from the good and the bad from the meet before,” Harris said. “We need to understand our mistakes and maybe in the next week of practice eliminate those things if possible. All of this is in order to win the Ivy League Championships; that is always the ultimate goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a 202-98 victory against Brown eight days prior, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team travelled to Penn on Saturday morning and handled the Quakers (2-5, 1-5 Ivy League) with a similar ease. The Crimson took 14 of the 16 events and cruised to the win, 201-95.
Harvard (4-1, 4-1 Ivy League) took an early lead in the first event of the day at Sheerr Pool with a win in the 200 medley relay. Sophomore Danielle Lee gave the Crimson an early lead over the closest Penn competitor with a 26.10 backstroke split, and junior Stephanie Ferrell widened the gap with the fastest breaststroke split of the heat at 29.84. The quartet finished with a winning time of 1:44.59.
“[The 200 medley] is always a great event to have at the beginning because it’s a nice, quick relay that gets everyone going,” Ferrell said. “That event usually gets the ball rolling, so I think that really got everyone going…that first one always pumps people up.”
The Harvard B relay in the same event placed third, tacking on two more points for the Crimson. From there, the squad never looked back.
For the second straight meet, Lee took home four wins for the Crimson. After beginning the day as the first swimmer of the victorious 200 medley team, the sophomore finished first by over three seconds in the 200 freestyle just minutes after the her previous race.
“[Lee] was really incredible this meet,” Ferrell said. “She really stepped up, and it was inspiring for the team to watch. I myself was super inspired by what she did today.”
After swimming in the 100 breast, Lee continued her dominance in the water in the 200 back, as she broke the pool record by .24 seconds. Each of her four 50-yard split times was faster than the competition, and she finished with a time of 2:00.85.
“She just got up event after event; even in events she wasn’t scoring points in she swam exhibition, she just swam to race,” Ferrell said. “And that’s really what our team is about: being able to race under any condition and loving to win, and Danielle did a great job.”
But Lee wasn’t done. Completing the marathon day in the 200 IM, Lee earned Harvard another nine points when she tapped the wall 1.16 seconds ahead of freshman teammate Willa Wang.
By the meet’s end, Lee had helped score 38 points for the Crimson.
Captain Deirdre Clute paced the field in the 50 freestyle with her 23.99 time. A little bit later, the senior from Alamo, Calif. took second behind Lee in the 200 back in her final swim of the afternoon.
Though the vetarns took center stage in Philadelphia, the Crimson’s rookies fought for heat victories of their own. Freshman Ashlee Korsberg claimed the win in the 1000 frees, reaching the wall 23 seconds faster than the Quakers’ Madeleine Jardeleza.
Sophomore Kendall Crawford and freshman Marissa Cominelli took the top two spots in the 100 back for 13 more points for Harvard, with Crawford’s 56.60 time coming just short of the pool record of 56.21.
Moments later, Ferrell barely edged Haley Wickham of Penn by .19 seconds in the 100 breast with a time of 1:05.49. Ferrell then went on to win her second individual race of the day, this time in the 200 breast.
“The 100’s are quick; they’re sprinty, and I was trying to stay in control because in those sprints it’s easy to spin,” Ferrell said. “I really tried to work on that, and I thought we had really good results in the 100 breaststroke.”
All four members of Harvard’s winning 200 medley A relay group won another individual heat on Sunday, with freshman Victoria Chan rounding out the foursome with a win in the 500 free.
Crimson juniors Schuyler Moore and Cassie Corneau battled it out on the diving board, with Moore beating the latter for first in the 1 meter.
“It was a close meet, with good competition,” Corneau said. “Schuyler and I had similar dives in a similar fashion and got similar scores, so the scores were close [in both diving events], which kept it exciting.”
Corneau returned the favor in an exciting 3 meter, with the top three finishers finishing within 1.60 points of each other. Her 258.75 points were just enough to beat Moore. But more importantly, the one-two finishes in both events gave Harvard another 26 points.
“Going into the end of the season, we have great wins over Brown and Penn,” Corneau said. “We’re excited for the rest of the season as a team – we’re looking good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It’s a big time of year for pro sports, with Super Bowl XLVIII just around the corner. The Back Page takes a look at a trio of former Harvard athletes now playing professionally, starting with a product of football coach Tim Murphy’s high-flying offense. 
The Improving Draftee: Kyle Juszczyk ‘13
Mouthful of a name aside, Juszczyk had the NFL in his blood even before he was drafted – his great uncle, Dickie Moore, played for the Green Bay Packers. After a long and successful career for the Crimson, it was no surprise when the Baltimore Ravens took the 6’1” Juszczyk in the fourth round of the NFL draft.

Before transitioning to the pros, the tight end broke records and paced Harvard’s offensive attack. He was a two-time All-American and three-time All-Ivy League selection and garnered dozens of third-party honors in his senior year.
By the end of his graduation year, Juszczyk had become the all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdown receptions for a Crimson tight end. In his final season, the Medina, OH product led Harvard with 52 receptions for 706 yards.
At about this time a year ago, when The Back Page did some research on him, most scouting sources projected Juszczyk as a “borderline draft prospect” at the fullback position. Yahoo Sports projected him to be a seventh round draft pick.
Leading up to the draft, Juszczyk moved up the board considerably, with ESPN draft columnist Mel Kiper Jr. putting Juszczyk in the third round, calling him “the best [fullback] in the draft.”
The Ravens eventually took the Harvard star with the 130th pick, hoping he could produce at the fullback position as a lead blocker. But the Ravens switched up their offense to a spread attack for the 2013 season, and Juszczyk wasn’t used much in the trenches and was on the field for only four offensive snaps the entire year.
Still, Juszczyk managed to make an impact on special teams as one of the three rookies to appear in every game for a disappointing 8-8 Baltimore team. His 245- pound frame was an imposing presence on kickoffs, and he should factor into the Ravens’ future.
"[Juszczyk] was one of our best special-teams players–[he] played like a linebacker on special teams,” head coach John Harbaugh told ESPN.com. “That’s a great thing for a fullback/tight end-type guy, but we’ve got to get him into the mix more. Kyle has got to be a huge part of what we do going forward…. We have high hopes for him.”
Fancy Footed Forward: Andre Akpan ‘10
New York Red Bulls and former Harvard forward Andre Akpan 10’ made some waves for the Ivy League back in 2010, when he was drafted by the Colorado Rapids in the second round of the MLS draft. Since then, the 2006 Ivy League Rookie of the Year has jumped around the league, playing for the Real Maryland Monarchs and FC Tampa Bay for a short time.
After the Rapids traded Akpan to the Red Bulls back in March for a 2015 MLS Supplemental Draft pick, the 2009 Ivy League Player of the Year and three year Hermann Trophy semifinalist finished the MLS season with two assists in seven appearances for the MLS team.
Though his MLS statistics may seem underwhelming after scoring 47 goals for the Crimson in four years, Akpan also started in 10 MLS Reserve League games and led the Red Bulls with 10 of the team’s 24 goals.
Akpan most recently appeared as a short-term substitute in the Red Bulls’ 2-2 tie of the New England Revolution in early October. Though he only played a few minutes in the Red Bulls’ last few games, the team signed the forward to a new contract in mid-December for the 2014 year. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Crimson at Center: Alex Killorn 12’
The Back Page last tracked Killorn almost a year ago, when the 6’2” center scored his first career NHL goal in the Tampa Bay Lightning’s 6-5 overtime win over the Florida Panthers. Just three days later, Killorn notched his first game-winner at 2:49 in the third period against the Toronto Maple Leafs, sliding the puck through the five-hole of Maple Leaf goalie Ben Scrivens.
The 77th pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft scored 38 goals in his junior and senior seasons at Harvard, leading the Crimson both years. After a brief year and a half stint in the developmental American Hockey League, Killorn recorded 19 points in 38 games played for the Lightning in 2013.
The 2011-2012 ECAC Hockey First-Team center has broken out in his sophomore NHL season. Killorn is one of seven Lightning players to have appeared in every game this season and is fifth on the squad with 29 points. The Canadian hailing from Montreal, Que. also has a plus-minus of positive 10 for the season, after posting a negative six in his rookie season.
