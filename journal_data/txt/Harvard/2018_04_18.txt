After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s too early into the second season to tell, but “Legion” might be losing its edge: the former surreal, abstract quality that kept its previous season afloat. As my co-reviewer mentioned in his take on Season Two’s premiere, “Chapter 9,” showrunner Noah Hawley said to Salon: “If the first year was about an individual who either is or isn't insane, what if the second year is more about a sane man in an insane world?”
My co-reviewer called this change a “mistake.” But the shift is inevitable, even if the dynamic is so much less interesting. Unreliable narrators or protagonists aren’t rare in storytelling, but it’s a trope that’s often reused because it works. People return to reality-subversion for that same adrenaline-pumping feeling you get from horror movies. Except in “Legion”’s case, the real horror in Season One was our hero, David (Dan Stevens), all along.
In Season Two, David’s no horror anymore (at least, not yet). But if “Chapter 10” is any indication, the show is struggling to find the same level of emotional complexity that made “Legion” truly bizarre and earth-shattering in its first season. Thus far in Season Two, the show has been relying on special effects to keep things aesthetically and superficially warped. In this episode, David jumps through time to find future-Syd (Rachel Keller) warning him of a danger greater than the Shadow King, colludes with Oliver (Jemaine Clement) and Lenny’s (Aubrey Plaza) semi-possessed beings, and finally confronts Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban), the Shadow King, on the astral plane. Most of the tension revolves around David’s own worry about being the good guy.
But we already know that in this present moment, David is the good guy, and that’s where “Chapter 10” loses its sharpness. In the episode, David helps the Shadow King enter Division Three’s safe haven by creating a diversion, trusting in the word of future-Syd and Farouk. And of course, Farouk cannot be trusted. Oliver and Lenny take down several men, turning some into ash, one into a pig, and the other into a fish. After the tragedy, David is horrified, bending down to touch the remains and re-envision the murders. But it’s a scene that feels so artificially sympathetic and, quite frankly, a bit overused. The inner turmoil that David feels is mitigated by the fact that we know that he has good intentions and in no way could have prevented that situation besides completely ignoring future-Syd’s warning.
As a default then, the tension would have manifested in David potentially endangering his relationship with present-day Syd, but even that isn’t the case. David explains to Syd about his predicament, to which she responds “Okay. If I said that you should do it, then you should do it.” And just like that, another potential point of contention is resolved. It’s almost too simple, too neat, and too weak to really sustain interest beyond vague allusions to whatever is coming next for them.
Anticipation is only so effective without robust emotional dimensions to back it up. The season could pull a twist and reveal that David was the danger to which future-Syd was alluding all along, but at this point that seems hackneyed, a trope that Season One already tried—and succeeded—in doing.
It’s a good thing then, that “Legion” is funny, because its self-aware references to TV canons still keep the show a step above the rest. When David and Farouk battle on the astral plane, they envision themselves wrestling in a single spotlight, wearing low-hanging singlets. “Ah, le sport. Physical. Very physical,” Farouk says. “What is the word? Uh...homoerotic.”
“Shut up,” David responds, and the two proceed to fight. The fight ends with Farouk releasing the two from their psychic showdown. “I don’t need you to trust me, but you will respect me,” he says. Farouk—something of an all-powerful psychic mutant—shows more interesting dimensions than David ever does in Season Two: What does it mean to be struggling for control and greatness, especially after you’ve lost your physical body? What does it mean to have to live as a parasite? And will he continue to do so, or will he break Lenny out of her purgatorial state? “You got what you wanted out of me, man. Right?” Lenny begs from Farouk. “Your friendly neighborhood junkie. You popped me like a tick, stole my face.” Even Kerry (Amber Midthunder) and Cary (Bill Irwin) have some sort of struggle that outshines David’s, as they try to figure out how to exist with their roles reversed, with the former uncomfortably trapped in the outside world and the latter uncomfortably trapped in Kerry’s body.
Somehow all of these side characters are more interesting than David and Syd, who are quite bland considering their watered-down and superficial responses to potentially earth-shattering events. Perhaps it’s still too early in the season to be calling it quits, but hopefully “Chapter 11” will bring back the quirky and bizzare “Legion” that we know and love.

Filled with George Ezra’s soulful, earthy, baritone vocals, “Staying at Tamara’s” is a treat for the ears. The 24-year-old Brit’s distinctive voice blends well with the acoustic guitars and horns throughout the album. On his sophomore album, Ezra plays with a wealth of musical styles and traditions covering American blues, folk/americana, alternative pop, rock, and South African pop. Ezra has taken a step away from the blues reflected in his debut album, “Wanted on Voyage,” and toward a more worldly and alternative sound. The album is named for the owner of the Barcelona-based Airbnb room at which George Ezra stayed while he was traveling and writing the album. The album triumphs as an exploration of George Ezra’s versatility: While Ezra’s unique baritone vocal is his defining feature as an artist, the versatility he displays on “Staying at Tamara’s” proves he has much more to offer.
The album is backed by Columbia records, featuring production by Ezra’s long-time producer Cam Blackwood. Throughout most of the album, Blackwood does an exceptional job of allowing George Ezra’s vocals a space to shine in the production soundscape. Ezra’s voice is never overpowered by the horns or guitars featured throughout the album. On the contrary—the emotional candor in his vocal performance shines, particularly in songs like “Hold My Girl.” His bassy, oak-scented, and sincere-sounding voice is transfixing with its endearing wiles. The production effectively amplifies the tone in his voice, building on the emotional tension by holding back and giving space in the production for vocals.
The playful bass lines, coupled with light horns and frolicing vocals, call to mind traces of Paul Simon’s “Graceland.” The similarity is most poignant on songs like “Shotgun,” and “Get Away,” which feature deep bass horns, syncopated drums, and light and playful guitar.
The collaborative track “Savior,” featuring First Aid Kit, bucks the thematic trend of the album: “Savior” is Ezra’s brief return to alternative folk-rock. While Ezra has listed artists like Bob Dylan and Woodie Guthrie as, he performs “Staying at Tamara’s” in a more modern, alternative pop style. On “Savior,” George Ezra and First Aid Kit harness a delightful natural compatibility between First Aid Kit’s lighter yet fierce tone and his own bass vocals—demonstrating a more emotionally urgent timbre to his voice.
Closing out the album is the trance-like ballad, “The Beautiful Dream.” Similarly to “Savior,” the track diverges from the rest of the album in instrumentation, theme, and even genre. The track is filled with light, atmospheric synthesizers, and a rare high-register performance from George Ezra. In [T]his dreamy summer day anthem about unrequited love, Ezra laments, “Is the grass of Eden overrated?” The lyricism on “The Beautiful Dream” and throughout “Staying at Tamara’s” is well developed and builds on complex themes to create a textured, nuanced feel. Each song is very much its own, and is filled with a relatively wide vocabulary and thematic scope.
On his second album, George Ezra proves he is an artist capable of versatility and panache. He adapts his distinctive voice to a variety of genres and styles, and succeeds in producing music that is both his own and not defined solely by his unique voice. The album is a testament to Ezra’s staying power, not just as a fleeting, interesting vocal talent, but as an artist whose music deserves to be heard and reflected upon.

“My Dear Melancholy,” the latest release by Abel Tesfaye (better known as The Weeknd) opens with promise. “We found each other, I helped you out of a broken place,” the musician croons on first track “Call Out My Name,” the combination of low register-vocals, nostalgic lyrics, and soft, synthesized piano suggesting that what is to come from the EP may be a reconciliation between the synth-pop power of the artist’s recent album “Starboy” and the R&B style of his earlier work. As the verse fades into a pulsating and repetitive chorus, it is clear that the track—and the ensuing album—is not a reconciliation of the artist’s styles but rather an attempt to go back to his debut mixtapes. This leaves Tesfaye trapped in an awkward place between the artist he was and the artist he has become.
“Call Out My Name” will be popular, as it should be. It’s easy to get the hook and the baseline stuck in your head, but there’s nothing in it that The Weeknd hasn’t already done. The track sounds like a perfect fit for the “Fifty Shades of Grey” soundtrack, to which the artist contributed his earlier single, “Earned It.” The only surprise comes from the lyrics, and the premise that they create. The lyrics are longing: “Girl, why can’t you wait ‘til I fall out of love?” Tesfaye asks, a markedly different tone from a musician who has created a diverse and appealing body of music under the persona of someone who does not feel very much emotion. The rest of the EP, however, drops off from this decent, yet unexciting opening, never quite finding its lyrical footing.
The fundamental problem with “My Dear Melancholy,” is that it is a breakup album that fails to cohesively reflect on a breakup. While the opening track suggests longing and nostalgia, what follows lyrically is immature and sometimes off-putting. The lyrics “I hope you know this dick is still an option / ‘Cause I’ll beat it up” and “You were equestrian so ride it like a champion,” (both fairly obvious references to Tesfaye’s high-profile breakup with model Bella Hadid) give the song “Wasted Times” a more self-aggrandizing feel. The lyrics alternate between nostalgia, maybe even remorse, and a kind of bitter desire, but not in a way that feels consistent. “I Was Never There” is the highlight of the album, finding an appropriate middle ground between these emotions, but any cohesion is ruined by the next track “Hurt You” where the repeated lyric “I don’t wanna hurt you” feels disingenuous when followed by “‘Cause if it’s love you want again, don’t waste your time / But if you call me up, I’m fuckin’ you on sight.”
The Weeknd’s uncouth lyrical discussion of his breakups could be forgiven if there were greater merit to its musicality, but the most sonically intriguing tracks are characterized as such because of guest artist Gesaffelstein. The French electronic musician is featured on tracks “I Was Never There” and “Hurt You,” both of which have more high-energy beats and tempo that fit Tesfaye’s falsetto well. Any attempt to return to the R&B of his album “Beauty Behind the Madness” is lost in The Weeknd’s failure to focus on a cohesive musical or lyrical theme. It’s as though he half transitioned his sound, and attempted more genuine lyrics, only for the two to turn what sounds at first to be an introspective breakup album into a stylistic miscalculation.
Objectively, the EP is not bad. There are a few catchy tracks, but it pales in comparison to Tesfaye’s previous work. “My Dear Melancholy,” is what we expect from an up-and-coming artist still figuring out his style, not a seasoned musical veteran whose body of existing work calls for something much, much better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From organizing festivals on farms to arranging events in Ryman Auditorium, EVAmore co-founders Channing Moreland and Makenzie Stokel have seen it all. The entrepreneurs of the music-tech company met in college in Nashville and immediately bonded over their shared passion for putting on music events. What started as a hobby quickly turned into a profession when event planners and artists started reaching out to them for assistance to bridge the gap between the two parties. EVAmore is an online booking platform for live musicians. Most recently, Moreland and Stokel came to Harvard on April 8 to share their experiences at the first ever Music Entrepreneur Conference.
The Harvard Crimson: What were the motivations and inspirations that led you all to create Evamore?
Channing Moreland: Being in Nashville, there were 15 live shows a night. And we loved it because it was like playing roulette on picking what was going to be the best event to go to. But we couldn’t get into a lot of events because it was 21 and up and we were 18 and 19. So we were like, “Why don’t we start putting on our own events?” We saw a need that the college community wasn’t able to go to as many live shows as we’d like to, so we started putting on our own.
THC: How did you find the time to create a business while involved in school?
CM: We were so obsessed with live music and it was our passion. There was never a question of, “Oh, can we make this work?” It was “how.” There were a lot of 8 a.m. crunch work sessions on Saturdays and Sundays. We always managed to get the schoolwork done, but this just became so much more in the forefront.
THC: Another service your company seems to provide is supplying a platform for artists to become popular. Was that intentional?
Makenzie Stokel: We are helping get artists out there and paid. But with that, we’re collecting a lot of data about which artists are doing best in which markets. That’s something that’s valuable to them and to the music industry, to know who’s popular, who’s coming up.
THC: Do you think this service is encouraging more artists to create music now that there are more avenues for them?
MS: I think before us, you had to be really creative to get booked or make relationships. So underground artists who are unsigned had to do that or they wouldn’t get booked. Also, a lot of artists don’t think about private events in general. To show them they can play all these shows and get paid pretty well and get live experience is another way for them to feel really confident.
CM: Something people don’t like to talk about is that when an artist is booked at a venue they are making a percentage of their ticket sales and giving away a percentage of their merchandise sales to the venue. If anything, on a a good night, if they are an up-and-coming artist, they are walking away with around 150 bucks. With us, an average event runs from 1500 bucks to 10 grand. To these artists, that three-hour event is covering their rent.
THC: You’ve spread to large cities, and cities with a lot of musical talents. Do you think it’s possible to be successful in places where there isn’t a thriving music scene?
CM: Definitely. When you look at a city like Denver or Boston, their budgets for corporate events are nearly double because of the scarcity of talent, so you can get artists there. We can even potentially work with the same pool of talent and get them there.
THC: What plans do you have for the service? What’s your next step in terms of expansion?
CM: I think something we’re excited about is what we’re building on the tech side and what that can mean on the data we are gathering. We are an asset to the industry. Technically we are getting data on up-and-coming artists. What if they get signed to a label next? What if EVAmore was getting listened to from that side? That’s exciting. Of all the things it could be, it’s our job to make sure EVA more stays open for the ones that make the most sense.
THC: In terms of the next place to expand—Channing, you’re originally from Boston—do you think there’s any chance of you bringing EVA more to Boston?
CM:  Boston is a special place in my heart. There are incredible talents here, but you see them going to New York, L.A. and Nashville because there is no industry here. That’s why I love that we get to come to this conference. We’re finally talking about innovating music technology here in Boston. So absolutely I want it to come to Boston. I want to give the artists here more bookings. We’d love to reinvest back into this town.

Last Friday night, a black Harvard College student was arrested after a physical confrontation with law enforcement. In the hours that followed, the Cambridge Police Department announced it would conduct an “internal review” of the events that transpired, as is their policy. This may seem like a good first step, but in light of the seriousness of the incident, which the Harvard Black Law Students Association has described as police brutality, it is worth observing how the department has previously handled similar cases.
The police department has argued that the violence perpetrated by their officers Friday night was necessary. This was also their tactic barely more than a year ago in Nov. 2016, when a CPD officer used pepper spray on a crowd of hundreds of students at the CambridgeSide Galleria to see the rapper Desiigner and Celtics player Jaylen Brown. A statement from the department reported that the event had turned chaotic and that the spray was “used by police to manage and disperse the crowd inside the mall after the crowds grew more aggressive.” However, a volunteer working at the event disputed this account, stating “[t]here was no mayhem before that. [An officer] sprayed, and it sprayed everybody in front of her. Everybody in front of her just scattered.” But the department’s justification implied its officers had something to fear from the crowd, which included many young Cambridge residents of color. Accounts of the event indicated that the opposite was true; the only reported injuries requiring medical care were the result of pepper spray. Even then, the department admitted no wrongdoing in the use of non-lethal force on members of the crowd. And people shook their heads in disappointment, and nothing meaningful seemed to change.
The department could continue to portray people who experience and witness the excessive use of force as criminals. This was their tactic 18 months ago, when they pursued charges against 20-year-old Cleon A. Hodge after an altercation with plainclothes CPD officer Thomas Ahern. In an eerie similarity to Friday’s incident, Ahern wrote in his police report that Hodge’s “hands were clenched into fists ... which I interpreted as a pre-assault cue.” Ahern is seen on video of the incident telling the person filming the scene, “Get away from me. You’re going to be under arrest in two seconds.” The department initially chose to pursue assault and battery charges against this witness, even though the only violent physical contact shown on the video between the two appears to be Ahern knocking the camera away. The department admitted no wrongdoing in the altercation or the subversion of attempts to document it, although it eventually dropped all charges; the internal investigation considered Ahern’s actions “consistent with his duty obligations.” And people shook their heads in disappointment, and nothing meaningful seemed to change.
Similarly, the department could restrict relevant information on their use of force from the public. This was their tactic three years ago, when they initially refused a public records request to view their use of force policy before eventually releasing it after public pressure. While neighboring cities released similar policies without incident, a CPD spokesperson argued that “officers following these policies and procedures may also be placed at risk when engaging dangerous suspects” and that public records laws protected them from the obligation to release the document, a claim disputed by First Amendment advocates. Under threat of appeal, the department eventually released the full text of the policy, with a statement that concluded, “[b]y listening, engaging and integrating with the community, we have established meaningful relationships and trust with the citizens of Cambridge. To ensure that continues, we encourage ongoing dialogue while we continue to proudly protect and serve this great, safe city.”
This statement reveals a fundamental disconnection between the CPD and many of the communities that it serves. “[L]istening, engaging, and integrating” is an essential first step for community policing. Indeed, many of the department’s programs deserve credit in this regard, from Homeless Outreach officers, who connect people experiencing homelessness in Cambridge to needed resources, to Youth Resource Officers, who work to interrupt the school-to-prison pipeline in Cambridge. But no number of community resource initiatives can build meaningful trust when the basis of that trust is shredded by police violence and the regular use of excessive force. A statement from Mayor Marc C. McGovern on the incident Friday stated that “[p]olicing in Cambridge is far ahead of many communities in the country, and yet we can always strive to do better.” The multiple incidents we have seen in the past decade challenge this statement, and even if it is true, it is not the appropriate rubric to measure where the city stands on this issue when there are sky-high rates of police violence nationwide and substantial racial disparities in them.
The playbook for Cambridge’s response to Friday’s events will be predictable because Cambridge police have used excessive force on people of color before. It is a threat to the safety of many people who live, work, study, and find entertainment in this city. This pattern was not interrupted when President Barack Obama stated that Cambridge police had “acted stupidly” in the mistaken arrest of African and African American Studies Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. on his own doorstep in 2009, or in the aftermath of any of the other incidents in the decade since. If the city hopes to end the systemic use of force against individuals of color, it’s increasingly clear that automatic internal reviews won’t be enough, regardless of what this one finds. And if people who live in Cambridge, whether for four years or a lifetime, want to move beyond disappointment and toward change, we need to demand meaningful action from our local government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As this year’s accepted students weigh the decision to commit to a Kennedy School education, they may recall the essay question that they answered in their application:
“The Harvard Kennedy School motto, echoing the President for whom the School is named, is ‘Ask what you can do.’ Please share with the Admissions Committee your plans to create positive change through your public leadership and service.”
We enter the Kennedy School asking what we can do to create positive change. We expect our education here to help. A piece of advice from a soon-to-be graduate: It won’t.
The Kennedy School curriculum is designed to produce elite technocrats. If you are interested in effecting meaningful change in pursuit of a better society, the Kennedy School is not for you.
The Kennedy School curriculum is based on a model of politics that occurs within the bounds of existing power relations. Policymaking, we learn, is the art of accepting the status quo and finding “solutions” within it. There is no critical examination of the systems that produce the problems in the first place and certainly no attempt to change them. Our job is to design top-down, incremental solutions that may provide some benefit at the margins.
Like the fish that doesn’t know what water is, the underlying model of politics at the Kennedy School is so ubiquitous that it is difficult to spot. We embody the technocratic mindset whenever we precondition policies on what is acceptable to those who already hold power. We do this when we plan to heal our cities through artificial intelligence and Google partnerships, or when we speak of race and gender only in terms of diversity hiring and representation at the top, or when we find all of our development answers in randomized controlled trials and social entrepreneurship, or when we exalt “big data” as the ultimate solution for local governments, or when we try to nudge our way to healthier living.
Innovation, data, and efficiency aren’t necessarily bad. The problem at the Kennedy School, and wherever technocracy predominates, is that it becomes perceived as the only legitimate solution, crowding out critical assessments of the deeper causes of problems and the potential for meaningful shifts in power. Why fight for redistribution when we can solve poverty with an app?
While marketing itself as apolitical, technocracy becomes guardian of the status quo. Unsurprisingly, a wealthy, powerful school trains alumni to serve the interests of the wealthy and powerful.
In a master of public policy student’s first year, more than a quarter of all required credits are reserved for statistics. The same for economics. Two requirements, on top of this, are dedicated to professional and managerial skills. And the MPP is considered less technical. Of the master of public administration in international development’s requirement-heavy curriculum, almost every class is economics or statistics.
In the spring policy analysis course, the MPP’s foundational training for the flagship skill of “policy analysis,” students are explicitly taught to design solutions that appeal to the existing arrangement of stakeholder power. Of the case studies carefully selected as aspirational models when I took the course, one sought solutions to climate change through disclosure of financial risks to investors. Another, an admittedly valuable set of voluntary guidelines on businesses and human rights, was accompanied by a lecture that displayed deep scorn not for rights-abusing businesses, but for the human rights activists who dared push for binding regulations. A third advocated determining rainforest land use through quantification of economic potential. When asked whether quantification would favor more powerful economic interests over the social and cultural needs of indigenous groups, the lecturer dismissed the question: Why would it?
Across all Kennedy School master’s programs, there is not a single required course, and very few on offer at all, that focus on contemporary, critical social perspectives: anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, media studies, gender studies, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, post-development theory, critical race theory, or queer theory. Rarer still are courses designed to prepare students to act on these critiques in pursuit of meaningful shifts in power. The few exceptions—electives taught by Kennedy School Professor Khalil G. Muhammad, senior lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64, lecturer Douglas A. Johnson, and HKS Professor Katheryn Sikkink, come to mind—prove that it is possible to incorporate critical perspectives into our coursework. The Kennedy School simply chooses not to.
Some would counter that, while critical perspectives are valuable, they’re not what students need for professional success. But such a response is premised on the same problem. A critical understanding of society should be considered an essential part of the professional training of those destined to have influence in it. Excluding such critical discussions comes with insidious consequences.
Others may argue that students have already had a chance to study these topics in their undergraduate studies. Yet the Kennedy School offers plenty of introductory courses on subjects we’ve already had an opportunity to take. And avoiding repetition of undergraduate courses hasn’t stopped the school from requiring economics or statistics.
In any case, I doubt that everyone has had extensive experience with these ideas. I certainly haven’t. That’s why I came here—hoping for some technocratic skills, yes, but also desiring a deeper understanding of the society I may one day be in a position to change and the tools to truly change it. I realize now that I won’t find what I’m looking for.
No curriculum is neutral. Of the entire body of human knowledge, administrators must select only a few semesters worth of courses that they believe will be most valuable to their students. At the Kennedy School, they choose sterile, myopic, and ultimately reactionary technocracy.
To prospective students deciding whether or not the Kennedy School is right for you: Come if you’d like. But if you’re hoping to spend your life confronting powerful interests to make meaningful change, your fight may have to start here first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Math Department recently announced that it would be hiring Lauren K. Williams ’00 as a senior professor, marking only the second time in its history that it has granted tenure status to a woman. We have previously opined on the need for the department to recruit a more diverse range of professors, and are happy to see that the department has succeeded in bringing such an impressive scholar to Cambridge. Yet we are simultaneously disappointed at how groundbreaking this appointment is—it should not be so revolutionary for a woman to earn a tenured faculty position in mathematics at the University.
From elementary school onwards, studies have shown that women face systemic barriers to success in mathematics. Cultural attitudes often tell girls and women that they are not cut out for the field, causing them to lose confidence and leave higher-level mathematics classes. This achievement gap is evident in our own community, where Math 55: “Honors Abstract Algebra” enrollees have been 100 percent male, and women have been asked to leave the department’s common room because they’re assumed to not be math concentrators.
Appointing women to more teaching and research positions in the department is essential to combatting this culture. Female and non-binary students deserve to have role models that share their identities and experiences and that can mentor them through a field still heavily dominated by male voices. Moreover, the important work of female academics such as Williams deserve the equal recognition and continued support that is afforded to so many male faculty members.
While Williams’s appointment is a much-needed step toward diversity, one must not overlook the value that Williams brings to our institution as an academic. We are deeply concerned at the potential for her appointment to be tokenized and for her accomplishments—in fields such as cluster algebras—to be overshadowed or ignored due to her gender. Williams should serve as an example of how women are equally capable of achieving great things in mathematics, and her having done so should be celebrated, with attention paid to her highly impressive resume and accomplishments.
Past reports indicate that minority faculty members often must take on the burden of serving as advocates and mentors for students who share their identity—an unfair additional expectation placed on their already overworked shoulders. So while we hope that Williams will serve as an example, role model, and perhaps an advocate and mentor while at Harvard, it would be inappropriate for the University to expect that these are all roles she is obligated to assume. We expect Williams to be given the freedom to navigate her own path as a newly tenured faculty member.
The Math Department must continue taking on the necessary burden of supporting its female students and building a culture where female affiliates feel valued. An important next step toward this constitutes the provision of appropriate diversity training to discuss scenarios in which non-male students may feel unwelcome. Commendably, the department has instituted two relatively new programs focused on hiring more women for teaching roles ranging from tenured professor to teaching fellow. Indeed, there is no contradiction between valuing female scholars for their academic work and specifically targeting them in recruitment efforts. The evidence suggests that women face unique challenges in gaining recognition for their work, and ensuring that this work is given equal consideration is quite different from selecting candidates solely on the basis of their gender—if anything, the latter scenario historically has benefitted men more than women.
We eagerly look forward to welcoming Williams to our community and classrooms. Her experience and innovation in mathematics should serve as an example to students of all backgrounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Phillips Brooks House staff members and College students affiliated with a variety of campus public service organizations are working together to create a new public service initiative.
The goal of the new program, dubbed the “Seamless Service Pathways Process,” is to make public service options more transparent to students, as well as to remove barriers that prevent low-income students from participating.
The initiative is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and seeks to strengthen relations between programs hosted by the Center for Public Interest Careers, the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship, the Phillips Brooks House Association, and Public Service Network.
One of the new program's guiding principles is to bring public service to the forefront of the College experience, Assistant Dean of Student Life for Public Service Gene A. Corbin said.
“Could we develop one loud voice that would move public service from the margins to the center of what it means to be a Harvard College student?” Corbin said.
Discussions which ultimately led to the Seamless Service Pathways Process began in the summer of 2016, when Phillips Brooks House leaders met with Priscilla Chan ’07 to discuss funding for programs, Maria J. Dominguez Gray, the executive director of PBHA, said.
“[Chan] was like, ‘How does this all fit together?’ So it was a good opportunity to think,” Dominguez Gray said.
“There was a great deal of discussion around the public service ecosystem at the College, and how the many terrific opportunities that are available to students fit together to represent pathways for students to be lifelong citizens and citizen-leaders,” Corbin said.
Transparency was also a concern, Dominguez Gray said.
“The end goal is for more students who want to be aware of and be able to take advantage of service experiences during their undergraduate and postgrad years,” she said.
In addition to several Phillips Brooks House staff members, 19 student representatives from various PBHA programs, the Institute of Politics, and the Undergraduate Council sit on the steering committee for the new initiative, which began meeting at the start of the 2017-18 school year.
“We wanted it to have a strong student voice,” Corbin said.
Steering committee member Saim Raza ’19 said students are involved in every part of the process, from identifying shared core values between programs to figuring out ways to make service experiences more accessible.
“When Dean Khurana talks about being a citizen and a citizen-leader, we’re trying to give some teeth and give some understanding to what that means to every Harvard College student,” Raza said.
Connie C. Cheng ’18, who also serves on the steering committee, said many of the students involved in the initiative had participated in multiple public service programs across the separate offices.
“The fact that there are organic overlaps in all of our experiences really testifies to the importance of formally defining these relationships and interconnections between the offices,” Cheng said.
“My own experiences managed to cross all of these places,” she added. “So making sure that we’re setting up a structure so that future generations of students have it laid out for them and have all the barriers removed…is super rewarding.”
Corbin said discussions with the FAS Standing Committee for Public Service about potentially combining “a range of experiences that would lead to some sort of citation or certification” were in early stages.
Though Corbin will step down from his position at the end of this semester, he said work on this initiative will continue.
“The Seamless Service Pathways Process has been a terrific collaboration between student leaders and staff representing all the public service offices at Harvard College,” Corbin wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.
“This important work will continue without me, and I will be excited to hear about the results and the impact on the future of public service at Harvard College.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Counseling and Mental Health Services at Harvard University Health Services recently appointed a clinician dedicated to helping counselors schedule sessions with students in an effort to expedite treatment.
The clinician, Brandin Dear, already worked for CAMHS and just recently took on this new role. CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis said she hoped the new internal coordinator position will allow CAMHS to increase the number of weekly counseling sessions for students it can provide.
“He’s meeting with individual clinicians as a way to try to help them manage so that their schedules are freed up to actually work with students in a more ongoing way,” Lewis said.
The move comes after CAMHS launched a new system this semester to reduce the wait times for students requesting therapy appointments. Before the new system, CAMHS had trouble keeping up with the high volume of requests. Currently CAMHS is trying to manage clinician schedules more effectively so that students who have had a 30-minute session can continue working with the same therapist in subsequent sessions.
“The clinicians were finding it was best to take in the student they saw for 30 minutes to their own caseload and continue to work with the student,” Lewis said.
To this end, Dear will work as an internal coordinator. His role will involve attending team meetings and meeting with clinicians to optimize their schedules.
The goal of this new position is to help clinicians see students and meet their needs in a more organized fashion. Lewis said her hope was that students would be better helped by this update.
“Sometimes students come in and they may be seen infrequently or they may have multiple appointments that they haven’t come for” Lewis said. “Brandin is really trying to help the clinicians and the service be able to see students, meet their needs and then, if they’re finished, let them finish so other students can come in.”

UPDATED: April 20 at 12:45 a.m.
Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie visited the Institute of Politics Tuesday for a conversation about  policy responses to the opioid crisis in America.
Ed Gillespie, a current IOP resident fellow, hosted Christie for an off-the-record study group. The lotteried event, held in the FDR room at the IOP, was open to a select group of participants. Christie also attended a Director’s Dinner after the study group with IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78.
“Audiences at both of these sessions will be composed of Harvard undergraduate and graduate students, IOP Fellows and staff, local Republicans, and friends of the IOP,” Kennedy School spokesperson Thoko Moyo wrote in email Tuesday before the events.
Christie served as New Jersey Governor from 2010 to 2018. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for president but dropped out of the race by Feb. 2016 after falling short in the Republican New Hampshire primary.
Christie chairs President Donald Trump’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. During his time as New Jersey governor, he rolled out plans to provide $200 million in additional funding to addressing the epidemic.
At the study group, Gillespie moderated a conversation with the former governor, discussing what “the current status on the opioid epidemic is” and solutions that state and federal governments can implement, according to the event description on Facebook.
After the discussion, about 40 minutes were allotted for student questions to Christie. Several attendees declined to comment on the details of the conversation.
Christie is among several Republicans who have visited the Institute of Politics in the past few weeks. Last week, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer spoke at an off-the-record study group hosted by current resident IOP fellow Scott Jennings, former special assistant to President George W. Bush.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf recently said in an interview that HKS would benefit from having “more prominent conservative voices.”
“I do think about how to present a full range of views at the Kennedy School and make sure that people who don’t agree are talking about those disagreements and not just ducking each other,” Elmendorf said.
Tuesday’s event was the last study group held by Ed Gillespie this semester.
Christie’s event comes as Harvard faculty and students have increasingly focused on policy solutions to the opioid epidemic. Last week, a panel of five former governors spoke about state level responses to the crisis at an event hosted by the School of Public Health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust will meet with two members of Congress this week to discuss a proposed bipartisan repeal of the endowment tax passed in December.
The endowment tax passed last December would require private colleges and universities with endowments greater than $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent excise tax on endowment gains. Harvard—among the 35 institutions affected by the tax— would have paid nearly $43 million if the tax were in effect in 2017.
Faust will meet with Alabama Republican Congressman Bradley Byrne and Maryland Democratic Congressman John Delaney, who jointly proposed a bill last month seeking to repeal the tax. The bipartisan bill is also garnering support from a higher education lobbying contingency that includes Yale University, according to  Bloomberg News.
In a statement Tuesday, Faust wrote that 36 percent of Harvard’s annual budget is dependent on endowment income, including the College’s financial aid program, which allows students from families earning less than $65,000 to attend the college tuition-free. Faust wrote that she will be “encouraging elected officials to undo this damaging and unprecedented tax” this week.
“Endowments are a crucial way in which colleges and universities fund financial aid that expands affordability and access, groundbreaking research that leads to cures and scientific discovery, and campus development projects that create jobs and economic growth locally, among other things,” she wrote.
In February, business experts said the effect of the endowment tax will remain unclear until the Internal Revenue Service irons out the the details of the law, like how to measure endowment assets or define endowment gains.
Faust has repeatedly criticized the endowment tax in recent months. When Congressional Republicans passed the law in December, Faust wrote that she was “deeply concerned” about the “unprecedented” tax. Faust said in a February interview the bill would have a “pretty significant” impact on the University’s endeavors.
In March, Faust wrote a letter with 48 other higher education leaders expressing “deep objections” to the endowment tax and urging leaders in Congress to “repeal or amend” the tax.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia’s graduate student union voted to authorize a strike as a response to the university’s refusal to collectively bargain with students. Unless the university meets their demands, student teaching and research assistants will begin striking next week.
The development comes after the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Automobile Workers became a certified union in Dec. 2017. A year prior, in a Dec. 2016 election at Columbia, 72 percent of voters cast ballots in favor of the union. Union members will begin striking on April 24 and continue through the end of classes on April 30, according to GWC-UAW organizer Olga Brudastova.
Harvard will hold its own unionization election Wednesday and Thursday to determine whether Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers can collectively bargain over wages and benefits. The question of what a strike would look like on Harvard’s campus has been a point of contention in the run-up.
Sam S. Klug, a History PhD student and union organizer, said Columbia’s strike authorization was a “last resort” action, maintaining that most instances of bargaining do not end in strike.
“It's absolutely an extreme case. Harvard administrators have said on multiple occasions that they will bargain in good faith if a union is formed here, and I would hope that they're as good as their word,” Klug said.
“Columbia's graduate students—again, in a considered action that 93 percent voted to support–have taken this only after all of their other channels were exhausted,” he added.
Support for the strike was “overwhelming,” according to the union’s website, with 1,832 votes cast in favor of authorization and 136 against.
Brudastova wrote in an email that the decision for the strike came after many other movements in which the graduate students appealed to the university to collectively bargain with students.
“Ever since the NLRB election, we have been organizing to put pressure on Columbia's administration in less disruptive ways: we held rallies, a workers' rights forum, we did outreach to other members of Columbia community and elected leaders,” Brudastova wrote. “We asked for many meetings, and they had many, many chances to respect the results of our democratic vote and start bargaining.”
“We see from our conversations on the ground that people are ready to continue with the strike if the university keeps disrespecting us as workers” added Brudastova.
Columbia announced that administrators would not bargain with GWC-UAW in February. In an email to union representatives, Columbia University Provost John H. Coatsworth wrote that introducing a graduate student union may impede the university’s ability to pursue their “core mission” to provide graduate students with the resources to successfully complete their academic programs.
“This fundamental legal question is one that should be decided by the courts; only that outcome will bring clarity and stability to the operations of universities and colleges in the United States,” Coatsworth wrote.
Columbia University spokespeople declined to further comment on their refusal to bargain or on the impending strike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Declining to take a side on student unionization, Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 urged eligible students to “go out and vote” in an election that will decide whether over 4,000 graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants gain the ability to collectively bargain with the University.
The two-day election, which begins Wednesday, may mark the end of a cumbersome, protracted legal battle on the issue of whether students may unionize. The process has seen a back-and-forth of appeals between the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers ever since a November 2016 election, in which students narrowly voted down a bid for unionization.
After a lengthy legal dispute, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the eligible voter list generated by the University did not meet the agency’s requirements and mandated another election.
“Hopefully, people will turn out to the polls and we definitely encourage them to do so,” Zhang said.
Despite these appeals to prospective voters, Zhang and vice president Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 refused to take a position on the unionization debate.
“As far as the Council goes right now, there’s not any initiative to take any specific side as a Council,” Boucher said.  “But at the end of the day, I think one thing we’re all in agreement on is that we want a fair election and we want people to be informed.”
Zhang and Boucher also addressed the ongoing legal dispute over student admissions documents, the latest clash in an ongoing lawsuit brought by Students for Fair Admissions—an anti-affirmative action group — against the University.
On April 10, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a small, redacted portion of more than 90,000 pages of admissions documents submitted by the University—including admissions files and internal correspondence between admissions officers—would soon be released to the public.
“It would seem problematic if it became public record, all of what presumably are very personal statements and personal pieces of information that students and applicants to the College put forward in their applications,” Boucher said.  “I think it’s fair to say that our role is to serve the students and we want to represent the students’ best interests.”
The duo would not comment on the merits of the lawsuit, though, saying only that “diversity” is something the University should strive for.
“I think this lawsuit is nuanced and complicated and I don’t know that we’re qualified to say anything on the lawsuit,” Boucher said. “But we recognize the values that come from a diverse community.”
Zhang also said she and Boucher have spoken to University president-elect Lawrence S. Bacow in an informal capacity and look forward to working with him this fall.
“I think he’s a very honest and genuine person,” Zhang said. “He’s someone...who does really put the undergraduate experience at the forefront.”
Boucher echoed Zhang’s praise for Bacow, saying he is someone who “cares about students.”  Boucher added that he appreciated the work President Drew G. Faust has done during her tenure.
“It’s been a pleasure working with President Faust,” Boucher said. “It’s sad to see her go, but we’re excited for the opportunities that will come with President Bacow coming in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2018 at 3:40 p.m.
Two Harvard Law School professors are now representing the black Harvard undergraduate whose arrest Friday by Cambridge Police Department officers has sparked allegations of police brutality and drawn national headlines.
Professors Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Dehlia Umunna, who serve as faculty director and deputy director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute, respectively, will represent the College student in court, according to a press release Sullivan and Umunna published Tuesday.
In the press release, Sullivan and Umunna wrote that the student is still recovering from injuries he suffered during the arrest.
“He is currently recovering from injuries sustained during his encounter with the Cambridge Police Department,” Sullivan and Umunna wrote. “This has been and continues to be a trying ordeal for [the student] and for his family.”
Before the student’s arrest Friday, the undergraduate and four members of local law enforcement—including three CPD officers and one Transit Police Department officer—engaged in a physical confrontation. The officers tackled the student, who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics, to the ground.
A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and began making aggressive moves toward the officers, prompting them to tackle the undergraduate. But eyewitnesses of the incident—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated that CPD’s version of events is incorrect and have stated the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times shows the student standing still surrounded by four officers while the officers talk to him for several seconds. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
BLSA has called the incident an instance of police brutality, and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Harvard University President Drew G. Faust later called the incident “disturbing.” In the days following the arrest, hundreds of Harvard students gathered across campus to discuss the incident, reflect, and plan a response.
Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. said at a press conference Monday he “absolutely” supports the officers involved in the arrest. CPD plans to conduct an internal review of the arrest per CPD policy, which stipulates reviews must take place following any use of force.
Sullivan and Umunna wrote in their press release that, while there has been significant public interest around the arrest, they do not intend to “litigate” through the media. Since the student’s arrest Friday, national publications including the New York Times and the Washington Post have published articles describing the incident and the backlash.
“Although there has been significant extrajudicial commentary on [the student’s] case, we do not intend to litigate these matters in the media,” Sullivan and Umunna wrote. “As the public is aware, several students captured the incident on their cell phones.”
“The video speaks for itself,” Sullivan and Umunna added.
The statement goes on to say that Sullivan and Umunna’s main focus is the student’s “health and well-being” and that the two lawyers will not comment further until they feel it is “necessary.”
“We hope that the public will respect his privacy and afford him time and space to heal. We will not have further comment until such time as necessary,” Sullivan and Umunna wrote.
Sullivan has a history of representing high-profile individuals facing legal charges. In 2016, he defended former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in his double murder trial. Sullivan has also represented the family of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black male who was shot in Ferguson, MO in 2014. Brown’s shooting ignited significant unrest in Ferguson.
Asked to discuss her decision to represent the College student, Umunna wrote in an email that she could not discuss the situation further and instead provided a copy of the press release.
“Unfortunately I am unable to make further comments beyond the press release sent out yesterday,” Umunna wrote.
Sullivan also responded to requests for comment with a copy of the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students in the Longwood Medical Area held a demonstration against police brutality Tuesday in response to the killing of Stephon Clark in Sacramento, Calif.
Roughly 100 demonstrators clad in white lab coats lay down on the floor of the Tosteson Medical Education Center’s atrium in silence for the “die-in,” which was organized in coordination with other American medical schools as part of the “White Coats 4 Black Lives” movement.
Clark, a 22-year-old black man, was fatally shot by Sacramento police in his grandmother’s backyard after officers responded to a vandalism complaint. He was unarmed.
Many students and professors draped signs over their bodies, some of which read “respect existence or expect resistance” and “racial profiling kills.” Others held cell phones in the air to symbolize the cell phone that Clark was holding when he was shot by police.
As sunlight streamed in from the atrium’s ceiling, the demonstrators remained lying down for 20 minutes, one minute each for the 20 rounds fired at Clark. Students and professors gazed down at the protest and snapped pictures from the balconies above.
Several Medical School faculty and administrators, including Dean George Q. Daley, joined in the protest. Daley lay down in the middle of the crowd with a sign that read “Harvard White Coats 4 Black Lives” draped across his body.
Before the students’ die-in began, audience members circled around the atrium to listen to Ayotomiwa “Tomi” Ojo, a first-year medical student, who opened the event.
“The White House has claimed that this is a local issue,” said Ojo, referring to statements made by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “Today I stand before you to emphasize that this is not just a local issue. This event did not happen in isolation.”
Though the Longwood protest was planned well in advance and was specifically in response to Clark’s death, it comes just days after the Cambridge Police Department forcibly arrested a black undergraduate—an incident which has sparked conversations about police brutality at Harvard.
In her speech, Ojo mentioned the arrest, saying the student was “a victim of excessive police force.”
CPD officers arrested the student Friday after responding to several calls about the undergraduate, who was standing naked at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse St. A later police report states that three CPD officers and one Transit Police Department officer tackled the student after he made aggressive moves toward law enforcement.
But eyewitnesses, including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, have stated the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times and other outlets shows the student standing still surrounded by four officers while the officers talk to him. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before stepping back and raising his arms to his chest. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
“When the events on Friday happened, it brought it a lot closer to home,” organizer Nambi J. Ndugga said in an interview after the event. She added that attending an elite institution does not provide “protection” against racism and other forms of discrimination.
In her speech, Ojo also called for required implicit-bias training for new police officers and increased resources to reduce police brutality.
Diana Ha, a School of Public Health student and University of California Davis medical student, spoke to the crowd after the designated 20 minutes when participants lay on the floor had elapsed.
“What we need is not just events like this, but real, institutional change,” she said.
David Hemenway, a professor at the School of Public Health and director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, then addressed the audience. He discussed the higher rates of gun deaths in the United States than in other developed countries.
“Guns really matter,” he said. “Guns in the United States destroy communities.”
Several other students from the Medical School and School of Public Health also spoke, some with prepared speeches and others extemporaneously.
Finally, Daley took the microphone, telling the demonstrators he did not originally plan to speak, but decided to do so while he was lying on the floor.
“That 20 minutes was a welcome respite for me to be thinking about this issue,” he said. “Looking at all of you, I feel hopeful, I feel very hopeful for the future.”
He called on students to research implicit biases, especially in healthcare, in order to find ways to reduce their effects.
“Please make Harvard proud. You have made me very, very proud today,” he said.
Ndugga said demonstrators wanted to leverage the prestige of their institution and career to compel change.
“Our main job is to go out and to serve our communities. We can’t do that if we don’t understand what they’re going through and how implicit racism and other forms of discrimination affect their health and well-being,” she said.
White Coats 4 Black Lives—a national organization of medical students that demonstrates against racism in policing—released a petition in response to Clark’s death. It calls for policies from the healthcare community “that will put a stop to this national crisis.” It claims almost 400 signatories, including students from the medical schools at Harvard, Yale, Brown, and Tufts.
“To address community trauma and violence, it is critical to mobilize health and mental health resources, build partnerships with the community, and understand systemic racism,” the petition reads.
This die-in was not the first protest of its kind at the Medical School. In December 2014, students held a “die-in” in the same location to protest police officers' use of lethal force against Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final days before Harvard’s second unionization election, University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran sent a rapid-fire series of emails to eligible voters highlighting three key concerns often raised by campus anti-unionization students.
In three emails to eligible voters—sent Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday—Curran discussed union dues, the composition of the proposed bargaining unit, and the impending strike threatened by graduate workers at Columbia.
This week’s unionization election is the University’s second vote on the issue; Harvard also held an election in Nov. 2016. The results of that election, which saw a final tally of 1,526 votes cast against against unionization and 1,396 cast in favor, eventually generated two years of legal debates between the University and the union in front of the National Labor Relations Board.
After three rulings by the regional and national chapters of the board and two separate appeals, the board ultimately invalidated the first election result, mandating a second vote. The vote will take place April 18 and 19; at stake is whether eligible graduate and undergraduate students will earn the right to collectively bargain with Harvard.
Curran wrote in two of the three emails that he sent the missives in response to questions students had emailed him. In Sunday’s email, Curran referenced dues that will come with the formation of a union—a longstanding point of contention between pro- and anti-unionization groups on campus.
If the April vote falls in favor of unionization, members of the union will eventually be required to pay dues.
Curran wrote in his email that United Auto Workers Union—a group that in Sept. 2015 partnered with a movement at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to form Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers—requires dues of at minimum 1.44 percent from its membership, adding that approximately 60 percent of dues and fees collected go directly to the international UAW, not to local Harvard students.
HGSU-UAW organizer Andrew B. Donnelly criticized Curran’s comments in an email, writing that, “We do not pay our dues of 1.44 percent until after we have democratically approved a contract.”
Curran’s second email, sent Monday, referenced the possible Columbia strike. Members of Against HGSU-UAW, a Facebook group for anti-union students, in recent days wrote social media posts calling the Columbia strike “unfair” and arguing that a bargaining unit would be unrepresentative of all students.
Columbia’s graduate student union voted 1,832 to 136 in favor of a strike on Saturday. The vote followed weeks of attempts by the union to force Columbia administrators to begin bargaining, including protests and threats of legal action.
If University officials do not respond to the bargaining request by April 24, a large number of Columbia’s roughly 4,000 graduate students say they will stop teaching and grading papers. Columbia’s union will not require all members to participate in the strike.
In his Monday email, Curran wrote that Columbia’s strike would affect its bargaining unit members regardless of their position on unionization.
“This strike potentially affects all members of the bargaining unit at Columbia, including those who did not vote to approve a strike or sign union support cards,” he wrote.
HGSU-UAW organizer Sam S. Klug said Curran’s email about the Columbia union’s strike “does not acknowledge” all relevant information.
“His email today, again, does not acknowledge the fact that Columbia’s administration is breaking the law by refusing to bargain,” Klug said. “[It] does not acknowledge the fact that 93 percent of the people who participated in the vote voted to authorize this strike.”
“The email also does not acknowledge all of the many steps that were taken before the strike that show that this is a last resort action,” Klug added.
Curran’s final email, sent Tuesday, responded directly to a question he wrote a student had asked about the makeup of Harvard’s proposed union. Inclusion in a bargaining unit is usually determined by the group petitioning for representation. Harvard’s proposed union includes graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants.
Curran noted that the defined unit aims to represent a wide variety of programs across the University.
“At Harvard, the United Auto Workers decided to try to represent a unit that includes undergraduate and graduate students from 11 schools and over 60 different degree programs—from PhD students serving as full-time research assistants in labs to undergraduate course assistants and hourly graduate student researchers,” he wrote.
Donnelly wrote in an email Tuesday that he thinks Curran’s three emails are troubling.
“Students all around this campus are having a robust discussion about whether we want a union,” Donnelly wrote. “For Paul Curran to intrude on this conversation with these short, misinformed, fear-mongering emails is startlingly inappropriate.”
Responding to HGSU-UAW organizers, University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote that the issue of unionization will have far-reaching effects on both current and future students.
“The issues surrounding unionization and whether students wish to be represented by the United Auto Workers are important and consequential for current students and for those who will come to Harvard in the future, yet will not have the opportunity to vote,” she wrote. “The University encourages eligible students to investigate both sides of this important issue and above all go to the polls and vote on April 18 and 19.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kennedy School students and professors expressed their concerns about the lack of minority representation at the school at a town hall with the school's recently hired diversity dean Tuesday.
The Kennedy School hired Robbin Chapman as its new Associate Dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging per the recommendation of a 2017 report by the Kennedy School’s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion. The report, which detailed low percentages of underrepresented minorities at the school, said this new position would “monitor the progress of diversity and inclusion activities across the school.”
Chapman’s first day at the Kennedy School was last week. Students welcomed Chapman at a reception Monday which Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf and Academic Dean Archon Fung—who chaired the task force—attended.
The following day, approximately 50 students crowded into a conference room at the school for the town hall hosted by the HKS student government. During the town hall, students voiced their concerns to Chapman, who took notes, offered comments, and asked questions throughout the meeting.
President of the Kennedy School Student Government Gessika M. Innocent said the town hall was open to all students.
“We have decided to invite Robbin to give her an opportunity to hear about what KSSG works on as well as for students to have an intimate conversation with her,” Innocent wrote in an email Monday.
Certain students were given a few minutes each to express their specific requests and thoughts about the state of diversity and inclusion at the school. Attendees raised concerns ranging from the lack of ethnic and gender diversity in the faculty to insufficient childcare to a need for compensation of students who work on these issues at the school.
Dena H. Elkhatib, a Master in Public Administration student and the co-chair of the school's Diversity Committee, said their presentation to Chapman at the meeting outlined issues which many students face and are speaking out about.
“They are cultural changes that we would like to see the school work on and fix going forward,” Elkhatib said.
Students also presented the new diversity dean with an open letter expressing their concerns and included the need for “accountability and transparency” and “student input” within diversity concerns.
Chapman said she wanted to hear student perspectives, even those who may be critical.
“I do like to hear what people are thinking,” Chapman said. “I rarely take it personally unless it is personal, and I get over it. I’m resilient.”
Chapman also said she “can absolutely agree” that she will “stand [her] ground” when advocating for students.
Professor Khalil G. Muhammad, one of the two African-American tenured professors at the school, attended the meeting. Muhammad said the “retention” of minority faculty at the Kennedy School is an issue the school must address, even if it is not an issue that he said all faculty are “in agreement” over.
He also referred to the departure of  Karen Y. Jackson-Weaver, who stepped down from her post as the Kennedy School’s dean of students last spring, as an instance in which the school “erased the past.”
“We’re pretending as if she didn’t actually have students, have an agenda, have a program, and to me, that is not a personnel matter,” Muhammad said at the town hall.
Responding to Muhammad, Chapman said "we have a lot to talk about."
The Kennedy School lost three prominent African-American women leaders in the past year, including Jackson-Weaver. One of the women, Alexandra Martinez, who worked as the assistant dean for the diversity and inclusion office, said she left because of a“lack of support” she received from other school leaders.
Nadia Niven, the student government's vice president for academic affairs, said the meeting was “constructive.” She also said that though Chapman is new, students “have hope” for the future.
“This is a very timely move for Dean Chapman to come,” Niven said. “It’s a huge, huge responsibility that she is undertaking, but I think what will be important is for Dean Chapman to be supported by the administration, by the staff, and by the students because diversity is not a small issue.”

On April 18 and 19, after two years of legal battles between Harvard and union organizers, the University held its second unionization election.
At stake was whether or not over 4,000 eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants could begin to collectively bargain with the University. 
The results of Harvard's first election, held Nov. 2016, showed more votes against unionization than in favor; but union advocates later questioned the validity of those results, sparking months and months of debate. After three rulings by the National Labor Relations Board and two separate appeals, the NLRB ultimately ruled Harvard must hold a second election.
The Crimson live updated this online-only article throughout the day April 18 and 19. Read below to relive two historic days on Harvard's campus.
_________________________________________________________________
April 20, 3:34 p.m.: The National Labor Relations Board's final tally of ballots shows 1,931 votes—or roughly 55 percent—in favor of unionization and 1,523 against. In a historic move, Harvard teaching and research assistants have officially voted to form a union. The installation of a student union is unprecedented in Harvard history.
April 20, 5:00 a.m.: Exit polling data gathered and analyzed by The Crimson shows the results of the unionization election are too close to call. The data—adjusted for response bias—shows a small majority (50.6 percent) of students voted in favor of unionization.
April 19, 8:00 p.m.: All polls are now closed, officially ending the voting period for Harvard's second unionization election.
April 19, 2:00 p.m.: Harvard Business School polls close.
April 19, 1:19 p.m., Longwood: The rate of voters is picking up after the lunch rush. 
April 19, 11:49 a.m. HBS: Rate of voters remains slow. One female international student—who declines to be interviewed—remarks to a friend that this is the first time she has voted for anything in her life.
April 19, 11:00 a.m., Harvard Business School: Not many voters passing through. Only five in the last hour.
April 18, 2018, 11:59 p.m.: The Crimson wraps up the first day of voting in Harvard's second unionization election.


April 18, 8:00 p.m.: Polls are now closed for the day.
April 18, 6:58 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Richard Childers declines to say how he voted. But he says he thinks there has been less "buzz" among students about the election this time around.
April 18, 6:30 p.m., Longwood: Stephen C. Thornquist, a graduate student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, stops to explain why he cast his ballot in favor of unionization.
"Honestly, I feel like there were really only weak arguments against it," Thornquist says. "It doesn't seem to me plausible that it could be worse to be able to negotiate and have some sort of say in decisions that affect us so dramatically."
He notes a union will give students "leverage." 
Thornquist adds he has found the tone of University administrators' emails in recent days "frustrating." On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Harvard's Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran sent a rapid-fire series of emails highlighting three key concerns often raised by campus anti-unionization groups. 
"I don't know," Thornquist says. "It's not like me commenting on it does anything."
Around the same time, a student taking one of The Crimson's exit polls reaches the section asking respondents' opinions on various University administrators. 
"Man, I wish you had put Paul Curran on here," he says.
April 18, 6:24 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: Voters are streaming in in small groups of friends. Clumps of people chat in English, others in Spanish, and still others in Chinese.
Some propose going out for drinks after voting.
April 18, 5:22 p.m., Longwood: Harvard's Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran stops by and stands outside the building housing the voting station.
April 18, 4:45 p.m., Longwood: Voters are streaming in slowly but steadily, usually in groups of two every couple of minutes.
April 18, 2:30 p.m.: Polls have now closed temporarily until 4:30 p.m.
April 18, 1:58 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: Harrison H. Li '18—an undergraduate who says he serves as a Course Assistant for a statistics class—says he voted against unionization. He notes he believes unions are a good thing in general but that unionization might not be the best path forward for Harvard in particular. 

"I just feel that the union would not be representing our particular interests," Li says. "Unionization is generally a good thing but not necessarily for CAs in sciences and math who I think would benefit from not being represented by this broader union."
April 18, 1:55 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: Students are now voting at roughly a rate of three per minute.
April 18, 1:24 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: A group of union organizers gathers outside the door to the voting station to chat. 
Aad Liaqat, another graduate student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, says he voted for unionization in the last election and he's voting the same way this time around.
He says he thinks that, "a lot of the time" on campus, the power balance can swing against students. 
"I wanted students to have more voice in decision-making for our students," he says. "I felt, during my four years here, that we were often not in a position to state our concerns openly and having a union would enable us to do that."
April 18, 12:38 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: Many students arrive with friends; friend groups stand around and members speculate about the results of the election. A question often overheard—"How do you think it will go?"
April 18, 12:19 p.m., Longwood: John L. Pulice, a graduate student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, says he is familiar with unions. 
Pulice says he was previously a member of a service union, back when he used to work at a grocery store. He says he really likes unions—but that he is not sure he trusts HGSU-UAW. 
He says he was working as a lab technician during Harvard's first unionization election, and says he did not particularly like the way some union organizers attempted to get out the vote at the time. Pulice also notes he thinks the union mandate HGSU-UAW is seeking is "remarkably broad." Harvard's proposed union includes graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants.

"I have not been satisfied by the explanations provided by the union in terms of the actual concrete benefits they'd provide, and I think it would actually deprive students of a lot of ways to communicate with the University and have, kind of, the freedom to represent ourselves," Pulice says.
April 18, 12:19 p.m., Queen's Head Pub: After a lull, the rate of voters passing through the station peaks again around noon. Several students exiting the booths outline their rationales for casting ballots one way or the other. Kevin Tian, the president of the Harvard Graduate Council, says he voted against unionization.
"I voted no because I'm not convinced I can trust the [United Auto Workers] to fairly and accurately represent graduate students," he says.
Others, though, take the opposite view. Jack M. Nicoludis, a chemistry graduate student living in Somerville and a Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers organizer, says he would be "excited" to officially join UAW.
He notes UAW has "a lot of experience" negotiating contracts with universities and other nonprofit organizations.
"I voted for unionization," Nicoludis says. "I hope with a union we can get better wages, better healthcare, better benefits, better protect students from faculty that exploit them or sexually harass them."
Elizabeth V. Harple, a student at the Graduate School of Education, says concern for Harvard's international students prompted her to vote yes.
"I want to protect my international student friends, who face a lot of challenges," she says.
April 18, 11:45 a.m., Longwood: Voting spikes for a few minutes—up to 20 people at one time—but then slows to about one to two voters per minute.
April 18, 10:50 a.m., Queen's Head Pub: One passing student, Simos Zenios, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, says he voted for a union. "As a young person and an international student, I voted in favor because I think Harvard's benefits are not sufficient, especially in relation to health coverage for my dependents," he says.
April 18, 10:42 a.m., Voting Center at Longwood Campus: Roughly 4 Harvard affiliates are exiting this voting station—located by Harvard Medical School—every minute or so. Many walk out quickly, saying they need to rush to class.
April 18, 10:30 a.m., Voting Center Near Queen's Head Pub: Roughly 10 Harvard affiliates are exiting the voting station every minute or so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The First Generation Student Union plans to change its name by early fall, following recent board elections that resulted in an almost full turnover of power.
FGSU leaders announced via email last month that they will officially change their name “to better reflect the community [they] have always served since [their] inception five years ago.”
The core mission of the student-led group—which formed five years ago— is to distribute knowledge and resources to students who feel unprepared when they first arrive on campus.
Andrew Perez ’20, the former president of FGSU, said the name change has been in the works since Visitas last year, when multiple students asked about the definition of the ‘first-gen’ label.
“There were all these different complicated questions that came with being first-gen. First-gen is an identity, but it's more than anything a feeling. It's a feeling of not understanding how institutions of higher education work,” Perez said. “We realize that that feeling doesn't specifically pertain to that specific identity but kind of that general circumstance of not belonging.”
Charity E. Barros ’18, former vice-president of FGSU, said the organization decided to pursue the name change so that all students who shared those feelings of “not belonging” would feel that they had a space in FGSU.
FGSU President Brandon Buell ’20 said he and several other members of the group initially opposed changing the group’s name, but hearing from students who felt excluded from the group changed their minds.
Buell said that while he identifies strongly with being a first-generation college student, he understands how other students from under-resourced backgrounds may not use the term to classify themselves.
“The problem I suppose with that is there are people who are very much not first-gen—there are people who identify only as low-income or specifically from an under-resourced community—they feel they've always felt that even though we've been fighting for them, they don't belong to the group just because of the name,” Buell said.
Buell said this emphasis on inclusivity is reflected in the new board, which group members elected April 1. The entirety of the new board—with the exception of Buell—are first-time board members, and they come from a variety of backgrounds.
“A lot of racial minorities are well-represented, sexual identities well-represented, and the people on the board are not necessarily first-gen anymore—some identify with the low-income, under-resourced community statuses instead,” he said.
Buell also said FGSU is connected to First-Year Retreat and Experience, or FYRE, the new pre-orientation program created to serve first-gen, low-income, and under-resourced freshman. He said FGSU does not oversee FYRE, but that the programs are “closely related.”
Perez, now one of the program chairs for FYRE, said he is also interested in developing the relationship between FGSU and FYRE, especially since they will serve the same students and provide them with similar resources.
“The biggest thing is figuring out how we form a cohesive body that is big but also caters to the individual. Those powers and those ideas are consolidating into one which will make it helpful to be able to move forward,” he said.
FGSU’s decision to move away from the ‘first-generation’ label comes a month after FYRE’s program name announcement, which also deliberately leaves out the words “first generation.”
James A. Bedford ’20, co-director of FYRE, described the decision in an interview last month as a way to increase outreach to under-resourced students.
Barros, who has served on the FGSU board since 2016, said that while the organization is changing on paper, it will remain true to its original purpose of uplifting students and providing them with resources necessary to thrive.
“Something we really want to preserve in the new name is that being first-gen, low-income, under-represented, all of those things, that identity is not defined by its obstacles. That identity is identified by the pride in overcoming those obstacles,” Barros said.
“Being on the board, you can sometimes lose sight of that because you have to advocate so hard and so frequently,” she added. “At the end of the day, my unofficial goal, my dream for FGSU, or whatever it's named in the future, is that people will leave that space or that community feeling proud of where they come from, where they're going, and where they are now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard softball’s junior class has played an integral role in the team’s success from its initial foray into college softball two seasons ago to its current chase for an Ivy League championship. The anchors of the pitching rotation are both in their third years in coach Jenny Allard’s program. The infield during any given game is almost entirely comprised of juniors. And one of two co-captains, outfielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer, is also a junior.
So it is only fitting that in crucial games, like this past weekend’s Ivy League series tilt against Penn, the junior class steps up in a big way. This week, it was shortstop Rhianna Rich and pitcher Katie Duncan who answered the call.
For the third time this season, Rich earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors for her performance. In the three-game set, the El Segundo, Calif., native went three-for-four in each contest, to go along with five runs and three RBI, all while battling the elements.
“It’s about tuning out the cold,” Rich said. “Coach always talks about us tuning out the weather and control what you can control. And obviously we can’t control the weather so it’s about buckling down and just focusing on the ball.”
Rich has racked up the most plate appearances on the team as its customary leadoff hitter. Unsurprisingly, she also leads the team in runs scored due to her natural speed and the stacked lineup of hitters that follow her. Rich has scored 37 of the team’s 161 runs this season, and she leads the Ivy League in runs—the next best tally is 26. She also paces the Crimson in on-base percentage and slugging percentage with .483 and .638 marks, respectively.
Perhaps most interesting, though, is Rich’s penchant for triples. In her rookie season, she racked up four three-baggers. Last season it was seven. This year she is at five, which is tops in the Ivy League. In the middle game of the Penn series, a Rich triple in extras proved to be a huge factor in the outcome of the game. Leading off the bottom of the eighth, Rich knocked a pitch deep into right field, motoring all the way around to third. Co-captain Maddy Kaplan followed with a line drive to center field, deep enough to allow Rich to tag and score to give Harvard the walk-off victory.
“For her to lead off with a triple in the bottom of the eighth, that was huge,” Allard said. “She set a tone offensively. She just really was consistent at the plate and made every defensive play.”
Duncan was tabbed the conference’s Pitcher of the Week. The rubber-armed left-hander pitched in all three contests, earning the win in the first two and recording a save in the finale. In the opener, she tossed all six innings and allowed just one unearned run. She came on in relief in the following two games, pitching 5.2 and 3.0 innings, respectively. None of the four total runs that scored off Duncan were earned, so she closed out the weekend with a clean 0.00 ERA and a .179 batting average against.
“Game 2...we brought Katie in, and she did a good job,” Allard said. “They stayed really strong and were able to pull out a win, which was great. We could have easily lost that game. And then Game 3, Sarah [Smith] did a great job. Set a great tone from the beginning. Katie came in to get the save, and offensively we allowed our bats to work and made really great defensive plays.”
After a solid sophomore campaign, Duncan has taken the reins of Harvard’s pitching staff. The Allendale, N.J., native has a 2.58 ERA and has struck out 63 batters. She is 12-7 with two saves, and has seven complete games in her 15 starts.
Duncan and fellow junior Sarah Smith form a daunting combination in the circle. Smith has been just as dominant when she has played this season, as the two have nearly identical ERAs, but the Somerset, N.J., native has pitched just 35.2 innings to Duncan’s 106.
With just six games remaining on the Ancient Eight schedule—three-game weekend series at home against Dartmouth and in Providence, R.I., against Brown—Harvard softball’s junior cohort will look to continue its tremendous impact on the team’s ascent to the top of the Ivy League this season.
“We know that we’re a great team and we have the ability to beat every team in the Ivy League,” Rich said. “So it’s about us trusting ourselves and sticking with the process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, April 14, the Harvard Radcliffe women’s rugby team (12-3) took on Dartmouth in the Ivy League 7s finals,  in pursuit of its third consecutive crown. However, the two-time defending champion was ultimately bested by the women from New Hampshire in a 29-0 scoreline, relegating the Crimson to a second-place finish in the Ancient Eight championship.
Harvard had previously faced off against the Big Green last year, when the Crimson claimed a 10-5 victory over Dartmouth to secure a Ivy 7s Championships title after defeating Princeton in the semifinal, and besting Penn and Columbia in group play.
Despite suffering a loss to the Big Green during group play, Harvard came back to secure the championship victory, an effort the team hoped to repeat on Saturday.  Despite falling behind in the first half against Dartmouth, the team hoped its experience and stamina would life it to a third consecutive championship.
“Though we don’t have as many competition days, the tournament style takes a different kind of focus and energy because we play many short games over 6-8 hour days,” sophomore Dominique Cantave said. “We’ve certainly been focusing on our play, shoring up our defense and attack. But, another component to our training has been making sure we can last through five games. We’ve done a lot of mobility and conditioning so our bodies can take the contact, and also mindfulness training to have intense focus throughout the day.”
Early on in the 2018 championship match, however, it was evident that the Crimson was facing an extremely difficult Big Green squad. Harvard proved unable to surmount Dartmouth’s early lead, and was shut out in the championship match. After falling behind 17-0 at halftime, Harvard proved unable to scratch the score sheet to conclude its Ivy 7s campaign.
This year, the Crimson opened group play by facing off against Columbia, Cornell, and Brown, the teams comprising Pool A. The team rolled past the competition both in group play, and the semifinal against Princeton. The women from Cambridge tallied an impressive total of 174 points, while holding their opposition to a mere 14 points.
In the opening match of the tournament against Cornell, freshman Arianna Romero and junior Rachel Harkavy both scored three tries apiece to lead the team in scoring. However, the tries were not limited to that pair alone, with sophomore Delia Hellander scoring in the opening minute. Harvard’s momentum only increased after a successful try from junior Genevieve Quirion. The defending champions coasted to a 64-0 opening victory, with further tries from sophomore Robyn Beese, freshman Sabrina Kim, and conversions from junior Susie Clements and Hellander. The Big Red appeared overmatched by the Crimson, who appeared set on a third consecutive championship run.
The winning momentum continued for the Crimson into its second match of the day, against the Lions of Columbia. The defending champions sealed a 40-5 victory, with Hellander tallying 16 points off of two tries and three conversions, supported by more scoring from Romero and Quirion. In the final group play match, against Brown, Harvard closed out the match in a 24-7 victory. The scoring was kicked off with Romero scoring the first try of the match, putting the freshman at the top of the team’s scoring. Not to be outdone, Romero’s fellow freshman Kim added tries as well, ending the match with 15 points to become the match’s top scorer.
“Going into the Dartmouth game, we were really trying to focus on running our pattern and staying calm and composed throughout the entire match,” Hellander said.
Despite a disappointing second-place end to the Ivy 7s championship, the Crimson’s season will continue into April, and potentially May, depending on the team’s performance.
Harvard will have a quick turnaround, as the squad will take on Army, Norwich, and Northeastern in the Bowdoin Polar 7s invitational. The Crimson will be looking for revenge, after dropping a 34-10 contest to the Black Knights earlier this season.

We brought you the types of Visitas hosts, now see if you can spot all these types of prefrosh.
The Overloader
This prefrosh has done all of their research and is ready to attend as many sessions as physically possible throughout the weekend. They’re an active member of the Class of 2022 Facebook page and have kept up to date with everything you can slap a -tas on since their acceptance. You can find this prefrosh posing for a photo on the Widener steps with their Harvard 2022 banner, and their lanyard hanging proudly around their neck. Various pamphlets and pieces of merch will be spilling out of their red Visitas drawstring.
The Stanford-Reject
This prefrosh had their heart set on another school and unfortunately had to settle for Harvard. They spend the whole weekend complaining and dropping hints that it’s so much sunnier in Palo Alto. 
The Elsewhere Commit
This prefrosh just wanted some extra days off their senior spring semester. In the process, however, they constantly bring that up they’re actually going to—and maybe even already committed to—another Ivy when introducing themselves at events. While others are scared of getting rescinded, this prefrosh will try to smash their host, convince as many others to partake in their debauchery, and overall be the worst influence on the 2022’ers.
The Soon-to-be-Rescinded
You can find them being goaded by the Elsewhere Commit to drunkenly pee on John Harvard. Whether they tote an unusual inclination to dank meme, or a vodka-filled water bottle, you already know they won’t be on campus come fall.
The Mama’s Boy/Daddy’s Girl
They took the “parents are invited” thing too seriously, and when you meet them you’ll also have to introduce yourselves to James or Susan, who insist that you call them by their first name. As if that encounter wasn’t cringey enough, chances are you’ll find yourself sitting next to their parent on whatever bus/train/plane you’re going home on.
The Prep School Posse
The prep school world is a small world, especially at Visitas. These prefrosh can be found hanging out with their upperclassmen friends and walking around with a massive squad on the very first day. They can also be overheard discussing the impact of this year’s record low acceptance rate—only 12 of their friends got in instead of 16.
The Conflicted One
This prefrosh is sort of a mess, and pretty torn about everything going on that weekend. Whether they are let down because they had the false expectation that Harvard was known for its crazy parties, or are going back and forth between a few schools, they’re noticeably whiny and bitter. They might lament at Partytas, “Bulldog Days was fun but I feel like I'm definitely getting a different vibe here.” They can be spotted donning a Yale hat, a Stanford sweatshirt, and MIT sweatpants, and won’t stop griping about the difficult decision they face.
Visitas is an exciting weekend for all but can definitely be overwhelming—even for you overeager types, who think you have it all figured out. Fear not, whether you ally with your prep school buds, fellow complainers, or that bad influence, Visitas is not the be-all, end-all decider of your identity or friend group. Live a little, and don’t worry about trying to (actually, please don’t try to) fit into one of these types.
