After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, the Cambridge Public School district announced that it will cancel school not only for Jewish and Christian holidays, but also on either Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha, both Islamic holidays. This decision was a step toward cultural inclusion and conveys  positive recognition of the needs of Muslim students. At a time when anti-Islamic sentiments and fear of Islam are pervasive throughout American society, Cambridge’s demonstration of acceptance and tolerance is a significant and positive step toward making sure all citizens feel accepted.
Eid al-Fitr, the celebration at the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice at the end of the Hajj, involve traditions of visiting relatives, exchanging gifts and giving to charity, and going to mosques for prayer services. Now students who observe the holidays will not have to choose between their religious duties and keeping up with their schoolwork; instead, they can celebrate their faith without the fear of missing class hanging over their heads.
Yet the idea itself of closing schools on Islamic holidays is not completely radical. Cambridge public schools will not be the first to do so, as public schools in Dearborn, Mich., and Burlington, Vt., have already closed schools for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha in response to demands from the Muslim populations in their respective areas. Moreover, Cambridge will not close for both days; whichever falls within the school calendar will be the one observed, and if both happen to be on school days, only one will be chosen.
In addition, the practice for canceling school for other religious holidays is already well established: Many schools do not meet on Christian holidays such as Easter, Good Friday, or Christmas, as well as some Jewish holidays, such as Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. Even as America becomes increasingly less religious, these cultural days are treated as mainstays of American society on which it is appropriate to give students a day off. It seems only fair to similarly recognize Islamic holidays and allow Muslim students to observe according to their customs, just as Christians—and often Jews—are allowed to do on their holidays.
Additionally, many students already have no school on national holidays such as Columbus Day and Labor Day, which, generally speaking, serve only to prolong the weekend. If granting this holiday actually benefits of benefiting those who practice religion and reflects the religious tolerance that America defends as a First Amendment right, then other public schools ought to follow suit in recognizing Islamic holidays as worthy of canceling school.
Still, as this trend of increased Muslim presence continues, the decision regarding Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha should continue to be made on a district-by-district basis instead of by state or federal mandate. Right now, school districts have the best sense of the needs of their neighborhoods and have relative ownership of their calendars. That reasoning, although recognizing the Muslim holidays is about more than just the existence of a Muslim population in an area, in the event that there is no Muslim population in the school district, a school district should necessarily give students the day off. Ultimately, it is a judgment call for each school district, and we hope those with Muslim students trend toward inclusion.
One argument against recognizing the Islamic holidays is that Christians and Jews would not receive similar treatment in Muslim nations. Yet this line of reasoning is flawed: The political systems in America are quite different from the political systems in place in many Muslim nations. America prides itself on tolerance—specifically, religious tolerance—and so should be ahead of the curve in recognizing cultural traditions. In that regard, we applaud the Cambridge Public School System for demonstrating a spirit of cultural inclusion and religious tolerance by including an Islamic cultural mainstay in its calendar.

Although it is the capital of the largest democracy in the world, Delhi failed India in the Commonwealth Games this October—a quadrennial set of games that unite 71 teams from former states that were once under the British Empire. While the opening ceremonies received international acclaim, and the city’s new state-of-the-art airport was built with inspirational efficiency, the Games’ organizing committee did not uphold India’s international image as modern nation of innovation and excellence; instead it shamed the nation’s citizens with its blatant corruption and incompetence.
Delhi, perhaps in its drive to accommodate  the tourists following the Games, failed to ready itself for the competing athletes. Most visibly, the Commonwealth Village, which housed the nearly 6,100 athletes, boasted leaking bathrooms, scattered feces, and wild dogs. Ticket sales were reportedly lower than expected. These embarrassing stories legitimized the quiet and loud ridicule by other governments and their athletes concerning the lack of discernable official concentration toward the Games. Although the Western media might have been overly critical, the seeds of their criticism were still rooted in truth.
And how can India defend itself? The Indian Olympic Association’s initial estimation of hosting costs total less than six percent of the newly reported price tag. Although miscalculation is one possible cause for this massive overspending, widespread corruption seems to have been one of the reasons for this strong underestimation. As per reports of treadmills costing $20,000, air-conditioners at $8,900, and umbrellas at $130, corruption seems to have jacked up pricing. The Organizing Committee appears to have adopted the habits of poor bureaucracy from the national government—an issue that has long frustrated Indian citizens. Now those citizens have seen those federal ineptitudes on an international stage, as the national media exposed each of the disappointing and avoidable failures during the preparatory stages.
Admittedly, Delhi made tremendous infrastructural steps during its preparations toward becoming the kind of refined portal India needs to greet foreign dignitaries. As a result of the Commonwealth Games, the city now has perhaps one of the most sophisticated subway systems in the world. Cleaner buses now drive through the streets. And, of course, the new, $2.7 billion Terminal 3 in Delhi Indira Gandhi International Airport will boost passenger traffic to 60 million visitors a year—and was even constructed in 37 months compared to the 45 months it took China to build its new Beijing terminal. Nevertheless, these changes, while admirable, were due a while back, and they were only forced to occur due to the international scrutiny that came from hosting an international sporting event.
And Delhi’s preparations do provide a distressing comparison, cliché though the juxtaposition might be, to Beijing’s pre-Olympic renovations. Communist capital of the world’s largest state, Beijing secured international recognition for its near-flawless execution of the 2008 Olympics. While China benefits from an authoritarian government—one so strong that it decided to ban domestic text messages bearing the most recent Nobel laureate’s name—its level of commitment toward presenting an incredible image of its country showed a level of pride and unity that was lacking in Delhi this year.
As an Indian-American who has spent a great majority of his vacation time traveling in India, experiencing the grassroots culture in many (but far from all) regions, I know that India is a complex nation. Its diversity is at times nearly overwhelming and makes the country sometimes feel more like a continent. But the nation still stands together—the nation still is proud. But the mismanagement of an event of such international note obscures that pride. That disservice is inexcusable.

Harvard has many leaders. As students at a prestigious university, we can assume that in one way or another, all of us are leaders. I have had the opportunity to witness young leaders of every race, geographic origin, personality type, and skill level over the past four years as I’ve directed Minga, a nonprofit organization that my friends and I founded in 2006. Minga works to educate teens about the global child sex trade and to empower them to take action against it. My community defines me as a leader, but as I manage  $80,000 budget and provide programming for 10,000 plus youths annually, I find myself wondering why I am a “leader.”
My high school offered a class called “Leadership and Diversity.” While the course and its instructors were well intentioned, the class aimed to make students leaders without letting them lead anything. Sure, we can learn about leadership styles by studying examples of great leaders, but leadership is something we learn by doing, not just by discussing. I’ve been trying to understand what good leaders actually do for a while, and I still cannot tell you a list of traits, skills, or experiences that good leaders have beyond what “Leadership for Dummies” might suggest. My understanding of leadership as it pertains to public service, community enrichment, and business is best described through the exploration of cupcakes and young social entrepreneurs.
A cupcake is made of flour, sugar, eggs, and butter—common ingredients. Assembled correctly, these ingredients form a delicious cake base and a fluffy frosting topping. Now, imagine you are biting into a perfect cupcake. Yes, you’ll need a napkin or 10 because you will have frosting on your fingers and your face. Eating your cupcake is messy. So is dissecting leadership. A good leader is able to take common ingredients—intellect, a team, objectives, and resources—and make his or her project look as sexy as a deluxe cupcake. But good leaders are constantly cleaning up the messes that they make. Leaders are always struggling to trust their intellect, to motivate their teams, to reach objectives, and to find enough resources.
Good leaders exhibit professionalism. They are able to use their core competencies to overproduce. From my experiences, not from readings, or lectures, or academia, I’ve come to define leadership as the ability to motivate individuals to combine assets in order to exceed the potential of any one individual.
Nancy Lubin, CEO and “Chief Old Person” of Do Something, a New York City based nonprofit that helps teens rock social causes, directs programming for over two million teens annually. Nancy sees every basic ingredient, from high school interns, to politicians, to employees at major banks, to notebooks at Staples as opportunities to create more from less. Her book, “Zilch,” explores 11 lessons that for-profit leaders can learn from the non-profit sector. Nancy epitomizes my concept of a teacher of leadership. She invests in people that she works with not by paying them exorbitant salaries or sending them to global leadership conferences but by giving them responsibility. She holds her staff, the young activists with whom she works, and her business partners accountable. She trusts “leaders” who are 13 to 20 years old with the responsibility of working to solve some of our world’s most pressing social pandemics.
Organizations like The Unreasonable Institute, StartingBloc, and EchoingGreen give young social entrepreneurs a chance to expand their impact. Matthew Kochman is the founder of the M.E.S.S. Express, a transportation service that is Moving Every Student Safely. To date, Matthew has provided over 15,000 students with safe transportation. His venture is not only sustainable, but also inherently good for his community. In 2001, an estimated 2.8 million college students operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Thanks to Matthew’s vision, thousands of students have chosen to use M.E.S.S. Express transportation services instead.
Sejal Hathi is a sophomore at Yale University. At age 15, Sejal founded Girls Helping Girls, a California-based organization dedicated to pairing girls in the U.S. with girls in developing nations to address community issues through microlending projects. Sejal and her team of girls have trained and mobilized over 30,000 girls worldwide to explore the possibilities of entrepreneurship.
Our generation is full of outstanding young leaders who produce impressive solutions to global plagues.  We can try to define leadership with words or with cupcakes, but these definitions do not give leaders like Nancy Lublin, Matthew Kochman, or Sejal Hathi the credit they deserve. We can try to teach leadership in classrooms, and we might come out of class thinking about leadership in a more academic way. But we can only define and learn leadership by doing it. Choose a cause, our world offers many issues—find some friends who share your interest, and do something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In arguably the world’s poorest country, on an island four times the size of Manhattan, exists a population of 250,000 people invisible to society and, in a sense, forgotten.
This island—Idjwi—is a six-hour boat ride from the mainland of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the middle of Lake Kivu.
Many Harvard students travel the globe to pursue their own projects each summer, but in this project, a team of seven students from the Graduate School of Design, the School of Public Health, and the Kennedy School joined forces and traveled to Idjwi to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the island and to design a preliminary framework for a healthcare facility. They hoped their efforts would also raise awareness of the island’s needs and gain international support.  This collaborative effort between the schools at Harvard is a great way to foster innovation and amplify impact; hopefully, other Harvard students will follow suit.
In the fall of 2009, Dr. Jacques Sebisaho, a native of Idjwi and now the Executive Director of Amani Global Works, approached the Student Alliance for Global Health at Harvard (SAGHAH) about doing research on the island. Together they began planning the trip to Idjwi that would provide the first thorough and comprehensive description of the island and its inhabitants.  Each student would be responsible for designing their own research agenda as part of this project.
After arriving on the island this past June, the team became familiar with the local customs. The more educated on the island spoke French and Swahili, but the common language was Kihavu. The islanders are devout Christians and find religious meaning in even the smallest daily occurrences. Social life centers on church and the biweekly markets. Groups have come and gone before, and the people of the island don’t want to be given false hope. “Please come back and do something, don’t just ask questions and leave,” they would say. The team reassured the Bany’Idjwi that if they could secure funding for the project, this would be the first of many trips to work with the local community to plan and deliver a better healthcare system.
Traders take vegetables and fruits to sell on the mainland, but most residents never leave the island. Poverty is extreme and most families have 10 to 12 mouths to feed. Kwashiorkor (protein malnutrition in children) is common, and there are an estimated 3,000 preventable deaths per year.  Though there are schools on the island, many of them cost money to attend—money that most families don’t have (islanders usually use barter, rather than currency).  The few children who get a good education leave, as there are few opportunities for them on Idjwi.
Michael B. Hadley, a HSPH student, designed and conducted a health survey, while fellow HSPH student Thomas A. McHale conducted a qualitative survey on men and women about gender-based violence and access to healthcare and education. Dana R. Thomson used satellite imagery to map infrastructure across the island and come up with randomized areas for the survey team to visit; Shu-Chuan Tseng collected data from existing healthcare providers.  Sunkyo Im at HKS assessed the how the healthcare system fits into the healthcare policies of the country. Marika Shioiri-Clark and Daniel S. Sullivan at the GSD assessed the island’s infrastructure—the designs of the buildings, waterways, and land use practices.
By the time the team was done with its initial assessment, they had over 44,000 pages of data. And although they are just beginning the data analysis, there are already some interesting findings. Gender-based violence is a common problem, most likely due to mens’ joblessness. The total fertility rate is 9 -10 children per family, higher than Sub-Saharan Africa’s average of 7-8 children per family. Health data from this region does not yet exist.  This assessment should shed light on more specifics of the health and medical status of the residents.
The identification of the needs on the island may be helpful in attracting more NGO and international support to Idjwi. Dr. Sebisaho’s organization that supports the SAGHAH Idjwi project, Amani Global Works, was able to achieve 501(c)(3) status this year.  This will be the first health-focused NGO to establish a lasting presence on Idjwi. Though there is still much to be done, SAGHAH is very excited about the headway it has made in collecting data and establishing ties in Idjwi. This is only the beginning. The group is planning a trip next summer to continue the next round of data collection and to begin preliminary planning of health care interventions. As global health is such a popular subject among undergraduates (I’m talking to you, Societies of the World 25), those brave enough to venture into this uncharted territory, or help from afar, can join SAGHAH to get involved in this exciting project that, as Hadley puts it, “uses the lens of health to connect other disciplines.”

CORRECTION: OCTOBER 18, 2010
An earlier version of the Oct. 14 article "Harvard Without Borders" incorrectly referred to Jacques Sebisaho as an Earth Institute Official. In fact, he is now the Executive Director of Amani Global Works. The same article misspelled the name of a student at the Graduate School of Design. It is Marika Shioiri-Clark, not Marika Shiori-Clark. The Crimson regrets the errors.

Philosophy and Classics Professor Gisela Striker—who attempted to foster an interdisciplinary graduate program in the study of ancient philosophy during her nearly two decades at Harvard—will retire after the end of this academic year.
Striker said that the program “never really got going” because it required more faculty members who were never hired. As a result, she said, the program has had only six Ph.D. students in the past 20 years—four in the classics department and two in the philosophy department.
And these low enrollment figures, she added, are due to the limited number of Harvard faculty capable of teaching ancient philosophy at the graduate level. Aside from Striker, only Rusty Jones, a newly hired assistant professor in the philosophy department, and her former doctoral student Mark J. Schiefsky, the classics department’s director of undergraduate studies, specialize in the field.
“Graduate students prefer to go to places where there are four, not just one-and-a-half people,” Striker said, referring to Princeton’s four senior faculty members in the field of ancient philosophy.
According to Schiefsky, Harvard’s graduate program in ancient philosophy currently has no students enrolled, either on the philosophy or classics side. Peer institutions across the country, though, boast stronger enrollment figures.
According to Josephine Kelly, graduate administrator for Princeton’s philosophy department, 12 students are currently pursuing Ph.D.s in the field of ancient philosophy, while Yale has four ancient philosophy graduate students, according to Yale Professor Verity Harte.
“At Harvard, I appreciated the fact that I could work in the original languages of Latin and Greek, and the students here are the best in the world,” Striker said. “But what this illustrates is that so-called interdisciplinary programs which are always said to be welcome don’t have much of a chance because they tend to be understaffed.”
Schiefsky expressed concern about the future of Harvard’s program after Striker’s departure.
“If there’s to be a really thriving program, there needs to be another person, ideally with a joint appointment in both departments,” he said. “I don’t think many prospective graduate students in ancient philosophy will choose Harvard if there are only two of us here.”
He also voiced regrets over the departure of a friend, fellow colleague, and former dissertation advisor. In the 1990s, Striker had supervised his research on ancient medicine, specifically on the ways in which Hippocratic texts influenced Plato and Aristotle. And since Schiefsky earned tenure in 2007, the two had taught together in the ancient philosophy program.
“For me, it’s a tremendous loss, just personally,” said Schiefsky.
For her part, Striker—who will officially retire in June 2011 after spending the spring on sabbatical—said she is contemplating a return to her native Germany.
“I’m not quite sure what comes next,” she said. “I thought there might still be some students I would work with, but that is clearly not the case. I may go back to Germany because my children live there and my grandchildren, and that’s the place where I want to die.”

Mark Vonnegut spoke yesterday at the Harvard Book Store about his experience overcoming mental illness, drawing from his experience as both a writer and a doctor.
Vonnegut, the son of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Kurt Vonnegut, sat for a book-signing for his most recent work, “Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So: A Memoir.”
He said the book continued the narration of his first memoir, “Eden Express: A Memoir of Insanity.” Completed nearly 40 years ago, that book recounts his diagnoses and recovery from schizophrenia during his years as a self-described hippy in the late 1960s.
“My first book wrapped up the complexity of mental illness in a neat little bow: guy is schizophrenic, guy recovers, guy gets married and lives happily ever after, but there’s more to the story than what I wrote,” Vonnegut said. “So, I wrote more.”
His new memoir chronicles his life following the mental breakdown depicted in “Eden Express.” The product of 40 years of writing, he said, Vonnegut’s new memoir recounts the return of “the voices,” a battle with alcoholism, and his experience as a pediatrician in Quincy, Mass., where he still runs his practice.
Vonnegut, who graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1979, spent the evening responding to Cambridge locals and Harvard affiliates alike with wit reminiscent of his late father’s lauded satires.
“Having a famous father is like having a leg up to nowhere,” Vonnegut said. Throughout the discussion he spoke about his father’s influence on his own appreciation for the arts.
“I learned the rhythms of how to write. I watched my father and saw that sitting in a chair and banging on your typewriter and crumpling and throwing away bits of paper were legitimate ways to spend your time,” said Vonnegut.
But the young Vonnegut, who said his father would have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after his experiences in World War II without the influence of art, said that his family has a history of using writing as a therapeutic measure.
He emphasized the importance of using such therapeutic measures and treating people on an individual basis, determining what works best for each individual. “The medical model has morphed into ‘shut up and take your pills,’” Vonnegut said.
He criticized current medical practices that he said depend heavily on the diagnosis rather than a holistic approach to the individual’s wellbeing.
But he also recognized his anti-institutional views.
“I’m not even a little bit sorry that I was a hippy and tried to start a commune. The wisdom I gained was completely worthwhile.”

Mentioning friends elicits a stronger brain response in subjects than mentioning strangers, according to a study published yesterday in the Journal of Neuroscience.
The study, conducted over two years ago at the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at Harvard, sought to determine whether social alliances or social similarities had a greater impact, psychology graduate student and lead author Fenna M. Krienen said.
Though Krienen had hypothesized that mention of similar people would stimulate the brain more than mention of dissimilar people, the study found that only social closeness affected the strength of the brain response.
Subjects were required to answer online questions and write short biographies of themselves and two friends before participating in the study. Researchers then synthesized biographies of two strangers and used the two fictitious strangers and the two friends submitted by the subject to conduct the study.
Krienen asked participants questions about similar friends and strangers.
Krienen said the fictitious strangers were as similar to the subject as the friends the subject described.
She said that in order to get the participants deeply engaged, she asked the participants questions about day-to-day preferences like "would this person prefer doing laundry to grocery shopping" or "would this person rather sit in the aisle seat or the window seat on an airplane."
When researchers asked subjects questions about the friends they submitted, brain activity increased, but when researchers asked subjects about strangers, even those who were similar to them, there was no activity.
Additionally, Krienen said the research indicated that the same area of the brain involved in speculating at friends’ decision-making and preferences also processed personal preferences. 
Krienen suggested that this data could be used in future studies to examine whether subjects with social disorders like autism and schizophrenia took a different approach to comparing others’ preferences with their own.
According to Krienen, the study might also lead the lab to conduct future studies to determine whether non-social tasks trigger the same area of the brain as social tasks.

When Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 thumbed his nose at Harvard’s administration and created a social networking site he, now famously, declared “I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.”
But Harvard may be finally catching on to the social media revolution with its launch this semester of an open source mobile application for the iPhone and a cell-phone friendly version of its website.
The free application has generated significant interest in recent weeks, registering 5,200 downloads from the iTunes application store, and the mobile site has surpassed 75,000 pageviews since its launch in September.
The application allows users to access an interactive map of the campus, the University events calendar, dining hall menus, and a smattering of other campus related features. The mobile website provides a similar interface and the same functions.
“It’s definitely convenient to have,” Ainsley E. Faux ’13 said. “It’s good to be able to quickly see what’s being served in the d-hall.”
In coming weeks, administrators say they will integrate the shuttle tracker application, which allows users to see Harvard shuttles’ locations in real time, into the official Harvard application.
Since the advent of the internet, University departments have established a presence online as each sub-division and program has launched its own website and, more recently, a Twitter account.
The University’s effort to expand and corral its presence in what Perry S. Hewitt ’87-’88 calls “the digital space,” has been spearheaded by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. As the University’s director of digital communications and communications services, Hewitt speaks with a degree of fluency about modern media and technology rarely seen among Harvard’s administration.
“I went here and I work here, and the idea that I can look up someone’s phone number wherever I am is hugely helpful, and the more services that we can overlay here the better,” Hewitt said, referring to the iPhone app.
Hewett said that administrators chose to create an application for the iPhone and not another operating system like Android because the traffic on the Harvard network comes overwhelmingly from iPhones. Of mobile traffic on the network, 35 percent comes from iPhones and less than 10 percent from Android.
Several other universities have launched mobile applications in recent weeks, and many of those have used closed-source template for their applications. But the code for the Harvard application was developed by a smaller programming firm, and is open source, meaning that other programmers have the ability to contribute to the application.
“Mobile apps is the first thing that is with you at all times—it’s an incredibly intimate thing,” Hewitt said. “To have a solution that accommodates things down the road or mobile transactions to me was more interesting than the generic app,” referring to the potential of open source programming.

The English Department is considering closing or reducing the hours of its departmental library on Widener’s third floor in an effort to cut departmental spending.
As the department finds itself still pressed for funds, members of the department are weighing whether the Child Memorial Library is worth approximately $28,000 in annual costs, according to English Department Chair W. James Simpson.
As of last month, library-goers are asked to sign in as part of the department’s efforts to collect information on the library’s use. “Once we get that at the end of the semester, we’ll take stock about how we can best deploy our own resources to keep that library open,” Simpson said, adding that he does not expect to have to close the library altogether.
This past Monday—a University-wide holiday—32 students had signed in over the course of the day. And as of yesterday afternoon, 11 students had signed into the library for the day.
Within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, departments and centers administer more than 30 area-specific libraries separate from the school’s Harvard College Library—the largest unit in the University’s sprawling library system.
But as many of these FAS departments face continued pressure to reduce their expenditures, the libraries have been among the primary areas to fall under the budget-trimming scalpel.
In the year after the 2008 financial crisis, when departments were asked to trim as much as 15 percent of their budgets, some looked to possible extraneous spending on their libraries.
The History Department, for instance, eliminated the paid graduate student library position, leaving the library open to students asked to abide by an honor system not to remove the non-circulating books.
The Philosophy Department limited hours of operation for its library in Emerson Hall and temporarily reduced the number of new acquisitions.
“Like all departments we made dramatic cuts in our operating costs, and some of these cuts affected the library,” wrote Philosophy Department Chair Sean D. Kelly in an e-mail. He added, “That said, the library remains a vital resource to the Philosophy Department and to the Harvard community at large, and we have no plans to cut library hours further.”
Though the economic climate has improved, FAS still faces a deficit of $35 million, which FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has said he will work to clear by the summer of 2012.
The Child Memorial Library is just one of a limited number of departmental libraries that is still open to all students.
The library pays graduate students to check bags and ensure that none of the library’s books are removed.
Open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and for reduced hours over the weekend, the English department library houses an extensive, non-circulating collection of prominent and historic English texts including works in Old English.
But the carpeted room facing the center of Harvard Yard is also open as a study space, with tables and armchairs for student use.

Richard Tuck, chair of the committee on degrees in social studies, offered an unusually humane portrayal of Jeremy Bentham, an eighteenth-century British philosopher who is often perceived as a cold utilitarian.
Tuck, an expert in social theory, delivered his interpretation as part of the Master Class lecture series at the Humanities Center.
“Jeremy Bentham,” Tuck said, “is often held up as a straw man for an often despised tradition of moral philosophy. What I want to show you tonight is more or less the opposite case.”
Tuck turned to an excerpt from an obscure early work of fantasy by Bentham called “The White Bull.” An English language adaptation of a similar fantasy novel by Voltaire, the book is part a tale of witches and exotic lands and part social commentary.
When Tuck asked if anyone in the audience had heard of the text before the event, no one raised their hands.
Unfazed, he suggested that the work provides valuable insights into Bentham’s larger ideas.
“The White Bull,” he said, is “an interesting warning about taking Bentham at face value.”
Tuck then analyzed the novel to interpret Bentham—often associated with a cold utilitarian calculus—as a thinker skeptical of judging the sources of people’s pleasure, sexual or otherwise.
“In a number of Bentham’s early writings,” he added, “the principle argument is an argument in favor of pleasure and against moralizing.” He substantiated that idea with a careful scrutiny of Bentham’s treatment of ostensible “crimes” such as sodomy and pedophilia.
“He gave a more sophisticated interpretation than I was familiar with,” said Joanne Baldine, a philosophy lecturer in the extension school. “It was a surprising and interesting understanding of Bentham’s egalitarianism with respect to pederasty and homosexuality.”
Of the approximately 40 people in the audience, some—including Professor Michael J. Sandel—took good-spirited issue with Tuck’s claims, most of which centered on the perceived speculative aspects of Tuck’s claims.
According to Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Humanities Center, the Master Classes afford opportunities to “allow for the pleasure of a slow and serious working away at the details of textual construction.”
“We often do very large themes,” Bhaba said. “But one of the great things about the humanities is that they teach you to read slowly, carefully, and meticulously.”
“In Professor Tuck’s lecture, the unit of analysis was often the sentence and occasionally the word—the nitty gritty. That’s absolutely crucial, central to the importance of the humanities,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School announced Thursday that it will embark on two major construction projects in Allston: a new executive education building on the school's campus and a Harvard Innovation Lab in a University-owned property on Western Ave.
The executive education building will cost somewhere between $90 to $100 million, according to HBS Dean Nitin Nohria. The building will be constructed with the help of a $50 million gift from Tata Trusts and Companies, philanthropic entities of India’s Tata Group, a conglomerate with a combined market capitalization of $80 billion.
The gift is the largest from an international donor in the history of the Business School.
The executive education building, which will be named Tata Hall, will be used for a combination of academic and residential purposes. Construction will hopefully begin next spring and open for use in the fall of 2013, according to Nohria.
Ratan Tata, the Chairman of Tata Sons Ltd., attended HBS School of Advanced Management Program, an executive education program, in 1975.
In addition to the new executive education building, HBS announced that it will renovate the old WGBH building on Western Ave. to open a lab for innovation and entrepreneurship. Nohria said he hopes that the lab will encourage innovation ventures across the University.
The price tag on the renovation is somewhere between $15 to $20 million, and the project will ideally begin in the spring, according to Nohria. But he noted that the timeline is an “aggressive” goal, and that it was subject to approval by the City of Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thus far this year, the Harvard men’s soccer team has seemed to raise its game against its toughest competition.
On opening night against then-No. 13 Stanford, the team rallied around forward Brian Rogers’ late goal to earn a 2-1 victory.   A week later, the team was able to pull out a tie in a hostile environment on the road against then-No. 10 Connecticut.
Maybe a matchup against another ranked opponent—and Ivy League rival—in No. 15 Brown in Providence Saturday night will be the spark that ignites the fire for the Crimson (4-3-4, 1-0-1 Ivy) and gets it headed towards a second-straight Ancient Eight title.
“There are no secrets or illusions for our team,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “This is potentially the most pivotal match of the year.”
But pulling out a win will certainly not be easy.  The Bears (7-1-2, 1-1-0 Ivy) possess a strong defense that only allowed one goal in its first nine games before giving up three in its first loss to Princeton last Saturday. Brown goalie Paul Grandstand ranks fourth in the nation with a 0.38 goals-against average and second in the nation with a 0.90 save percentage and a 0.80 shutout percentage.
“[Their defense is] not a concern for us,” junior midfielder Jamie Rees said. “In terms of scoring, our team is confident that we’ll be just fine.  We know our defense is as good if not better than theirs, so we only need one or two goals to get a good result out of the game.”
But scoring could be especially tough for the Crimson Saturday, as the team may again be without Rogers, the team's leading scorer who injured his shoulder Oct. 2 against Yale.  The sophomore was medically cleared to play this week, but Junot said Tuesday he hadn’t yet decided if he would play Rogers against Brown.
Since Rogers first went down, the team has managed just one goal per game and has lacked the scoring spark that the forward provided, but Junot has seen positives in his team’s production during that time.
“Since Rogers has been out with an injury we’ve had two goals from two different people,” Junot said. “I actually think our overall productivity as a team has increased, at least in terms of the different players who have contributed to our offense.”
The Bears have been better offensively thus far, averaging 1.60 goals per game to Harvard’s 1.09. Sean Rosa leads the squad with four goals and 11 points, while Jon Okafor and T.J. Popolizio have contributed three goals apiece.  Austin Mandel leads the team with four assists.
For the Crimson, after Rogers, sophomore midfielder Scott Prozeller is second on the team with two goals, while Prozeller and freshman Kyle Henderson are tied for second with five points each.  Henderson’s classmate Connor McCarthy is coming off his first Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor after scoring the game-winning goal against Holy Cross.
In net for Harvard, junior Austin Harms sports a 1.14 goals-against average and has two shutouts in his last three games.
“Austin’s playing at a very high level right now,” Junot said.  “He’s playing with a lot of confidence.”
One thing the Crimson will have to tidy up is finishing each half strong defensively.  Last week against Cornell, the team gave up a game-tying goal in the 89th minute.  Earlier in the season, Providence scored the eventual game-winning goal with just two seconds remaining in the first half.
“Certainly within the Ivy League every game and every minute matters, and I think we’ll be a lot more focused,” Rees said. “It certainly won’t be a problem again.”
Last year, the two teams met on the same October weekend in Cambridge.  Brown was again the No. 15 team in the country at that point, while Harvard was No. 6, a ranking they held earlier in this season.  In that game, Harms recorded a 1-0 shutout with the winning goal coming when graduated leading scorer Andre Akpan ’10 took a pass from Rogers and beat Grandstand.
But this year, there will be no Akpan and maybe no Rogers to bail out the offense.  If Harvard is going to knock off its second ranked opponent this season and pick up a crucial Ivy victory, it will be someone else’s turn to step up.  Despite his offense’s recent struggles, Junot believes in his team’s ability to pull out a win.
“[Brown] lost their game against Princeton 3-0 which I think exposed a lot of their weaknesses,” Junot said. “I think we’re carrying a lot of confidence into the game...we’re potentially one win away from being [considered] the top team in the Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard students will be preparing for midterms or getting the weekend started tomorrow night, many students at big-time college basketball schools will be gearing up for Midnight Madness, as, at 12 a.m., teams will be allowed to practice for the first time per NCAA regulations.
So, though the men’s basketball season starts Nov. 13 when the Crimson travels down to Fairfax, Va., to face George Mason, Harvard’s quest for its first Ivy League title begins in earnest this weekend.
If only we had a chance to be there.
Midnight Madness, a large event at other college campuses, has yet to land in Cambridge. Other schools, namely those from the power conferences, will fill their gymnasiums late tomorrow night so that students can come together and meet their team. In what is closer to a pep rally than a practice, players are introduced and then compete in dunk contests, three-point shootouts, and split-squad scrimmages.
(Last year at Kentucky, John Wall—now an NBA point guard that occasionally gets worked by Jeremy Lin ’10—dropped the “John Wall Dance” at “Big Blue Madness.”)
I know that Harvard hardly qualifies as a big-time college basketball program, but I have a hard time believing that Midnight Madness at Lavietes Pavilion would not be a huge hit.
First of all, the success of night games has demonstrated that students are actually very interested in going to Crimson athletic events.  Harvard might not have the most passionate fan base, but undergrads turn out for these games. I suspect part of this appeal is that students want to come together instead of listlessly wandering between River Houses and final clubs. Given a once-a-year event like this, Midnight Madness could definitely gain a critical mass of support and garner a big crowd (provided that football and other fall sports teams could come).
Skeptics might say that no one will want to go across the river unless an actual game is taking place. They’re wrong. The game hardly matters. At a given Ivy League basketball game, one-third of the student section is interested in the play on the court, one-third is drunk, and one-third is there because the other two-thirds are there.
Midnight Madness would appeal to all three groups. Who could look away as Kyle Casey (get well soon) skies for a tomahawk jam or Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster launch the last bonus ball in the three-point contest? It would be like an All-Star weekend the first day of the season.
Not only that, students would get to know the players themselves. Instead of chants like “Let’s Go, Harvard,” fans would cheer for the stars, the benchwarmers, the seniors, and the freshmen, individually. “Ug-o O-kam” (clap, clap, clapclapclap). The team would ingratiate itself to the whole community in the process and begin to build an identity.
The spirit of Midnight Madness fits so well with this team. The coaching staff continually advertises its “exciting brand” of basketball—its up-tempo, aggressive style of play. It should seize the opportunity to jazz up the student body with some showmanship.
The women’s team should jump on this bandwagon as well and team-up with the guys for a coed full-court run. Kathy Delaney-Smith could match wits with Tommy Amaker on the sidelines (of course, she’ll still have bragging rights with her 11 Ivy League titles).
As of now, the closest the Crimson comes to hyping up its fans for the coming season is its annual Coaches’ Clinic, taking place this year on Oct. 30 with former NBA head coach and current Celtics assistant Lawrence Frank as the guest lecturer. Harvard students might love school, but even they prefer to keep their studies and their sports unmixed, I think.
Harvard’s basketball program has done a lot of things right lately. The men have nabbed recruits from the likes of Colorado, USC, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Boston College, Gonzaga, Arizona State, Utah, BYU, UNLV, Penn, and Cornell so far this fall.
Bringing Midnight Madness to Cambridge would be another step in establishing the Crimson as a legitimate college basketball destination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following Harvard football this season has been a little bit like watching my beloved Red Sox in 2010. Things started off well enough, although there were some early bumps in the road (the Crimson lost Collier Winters and was embarrassed at Brown, the Sox lost Jacoby Ellsbury and got swept by the Rays at home). And then the sporting gods decided that the team had experienced enough recent success and decided to dole out a plague of injuries.
Harvard has started its third-string quarterback in the last two games, is playing without two of its starting wideouts, and has seen its linebackers and secondary decimated by injury. Looking at the starting lineup from the Cornell game brought me back to the dark ages of July when a typical Sox lineup included Kevin Cash, Darnell McDonald, and Bill Hall.
The injury plague hasn’t just been limited to the Crimson, though. The Bears lost their starting quarterback for the rest of the season two weeks ago against Rhode Island when Kyle Newhall-Caballero went down with a broken wrist, and Princeton’s defense took a huge hit in Week 1 when co-captain and linebacker Steven Cody broke his leg.
Now the big question is how each team will respond. Who will step up and play like Victor Martinez in a contract year? Which young gun will be Ivy football’s version of Ryan Kalish? And who will pull a Josh Beckett and doom his team’s fans to a season of agony and thoughts of what could have been?
We won’t learn too much this week, as all eyes will rightly be on a matchup of Ivy unbeatens—Columbia and Penn—in Philadelphia. Which team will fall victim to the wrath of the sporting gods next? Maybe that’s the better question.
Let’s take a spin around the Ivies.
FORDHAM (2-4) at YALE (3-1, 2-0 Ivy)
Yale’s on a roll. Fordham...not so much. The Rams have lost three straight, including a pair to Patriot League foes Holy Cross and Lehigh. But Fordham does have a big positive on its resume: it’s the only team to beat Columbia this season with a 16-9 win way back on Sept. 18.
Meanwhile, the Bulldogs picked up a big road win at Dartmouth last week with a last-minute field goal. The jury’s still out about whether beating the Big Green is something to brag about or if Yale should be embarrassed that it almost lost to once-lowly Dartmouth. But regardless, quarterback Patrick Witt is averaging 277 yards per game, the Bulldogs have two established running backs, and the Rams are reeling. Seems like that decision to start awarding athletic scholarships hasn’t paid off for Fordham yet. Advantage Yale.
Prediction: Yale 31, Fordham 17.
COLGATE (3-2, 1-0 Patriot)                       at CORNELL (1-3, 0-2 Ivy)
Please. This is Cornell, the team that recovered a fumble on Harvard’s five-yard line last week and only got a field goal out of it. Is there even a question? The Raiders should roll to a second-straight Ivy win.
Prediction: Colgate 35, Cornell 10.
HOLY CROSS (3-3, 0-1 Patriot)                   at DARTMOUTH (2-2, 0-2 Ivy)
Ah, Dartmouth. How you toy with my emotions. After I raised a hullabaloo last week about how the Big Green was the dark horse of the Ivy League, the team went and lost to Yale. So much for that.
Meanwhile, Holy Cross has put together two straight wins to bring its record back to .500. That includes a 17-13 victory over Brown last weekend, when Ryan Taggart picked apart the Bears’ defense to the tune of 331 passing yards.
The Crusaders’ defense seems suspect, and Dartmouth tailback Nick Schwieger is a serious threat on the ground. This one should be close, but my faith in the Big Green is gone.
Prediction: Holy Cross 31, Dartmouth 28.
BROWN (2-2, 1-0 Ivy) at PRINCETON (1-3, 0-1 Ivy)
Brown is now a Newhall-Caballero-less team again, and that is good news for the rest of the Ivy League. The Bears had to turn to their third-string sophomore quarterback, Patrick Donnelly, last week (sound familiar?) after backup Joe Springer failed to get a first down in the opening quarter against Holy Cross, and Brown sputtered to a loss.
The Bears are still an undefeated Ivy team, but they will have trouble keeping that unblemished record intact without Newhall-Caballero. Still, that perfect record should remain standing after this Saturday. Princeton has been outscored, 86-24, over its last two contests. Depleted as they are, Brown should pick up another W.
Prediction: Brown 24, Princeton 10.
COLUMBIA (3-1, 1-0 Ivy) at No. 25 PENN (3-1, 1-0 Ivy)
If you’re going to pay attention to any Ivy football game this weekend, make it this clash in Philadelphia. Columbia is looking darn good, and its sophomore QB Sean Brackett has won two straight Ivy Offensive Player of the Week awards. Brackett has thrown for eight touchdowns in the last two games, and he added a rushing score of his own in a win over Lafayette last week.
But the Lions’ offense is coming up against the top defense in the Ivy League, a team that’s allowed an average of just 165 passing yards per game this season. Penn isn’t flashy—it’s just good. And the Quakers haven’t lost to Columbia since 1996.
Brown’s down for the count, and the Crimson has already picked up a league loss, so this game is going to determine who the rest of the Ancient Eight is going to be chasing. Call me crazy, but I’m putting my proverbial money on Brackett and his Lions.
Prediction: Columbia 24, Penn 22.
LEHIGH (3-2, 0-0 Patriot) at HARVARD (3-1, 1-1 Ivy)
Last year, Harvard rolled over Lehigh and Cornell before being handed its worst loss of the season at home at the hands of Lafayette. This year, the Crimson has steamrolled the Leopards and Big Red, and now it’s facing a bigger test in the visiting Mountain Hawks.
Lehigh is much better than the 4-7 team that Harvard dominated last year—its only two losses have been against nationally-ranked Villanova and New Hampshire. But the Mountain Hawks aren’t a great team, and they’re giving up an average of 427 yards of offense per game. This is a perfect test for the injury-battered Crimson to find out what it’s made of before plunging head-first into the rest of its Ivy schedule.
Prediction: Harvard 21, Lehigh 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ah, October. The leaves are falling, the air is becoming crisper, and the midterms are here. For all of you students who have been hibernating in Lamont for the last week (it’s okay, just keep telling yourself that you don’t really need to shower every day), don’t worry—you haven’t missed much in Ivy League sports. The more things change, the more things stay the same: smart kids go to Harvard and Princeton, Brown only excels in the most obscure of sports, and there’s nothing to do in Ithaca. Seriously. Let’s take a trip around the water cooler—you know it’s a lot more fun than that orgo pset anyway.
Who knew that Bears rode horses? Brown’s equestrian team picked up its second straight victory at the Brown Show last weekend. Senior Allegra Aron was the top performer for the Bears, winning the first class in the Open Flat and coming in second in the Open Fences first class. Brown stands 18 points ahead of URI in the regional rankings, making the equestrian team one of the only bright spots for the Bears’ athletics program last weekend. Every other fall team, save women’s golf, lost.
A pair of freshmen football players—Harvard’s Ricky Zorn and Princeton’s Max Coale—were honored as winners of the 2010 NFF National High School Scholar-Athlete Awards, the schools announced this morning. The award recognizes outstanding high school performance in the classroom and on the gridiron, selecting one winner from each of five regions around the country. Zorn and Coale are joined by Bowdoin’s Lonnie Hackett, Duke’s Tevin Hood, and Johns Hopkins’ Daniel Wodicka on the list of honorees. The quintet will be honored at luncheon in December at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.
Dartmouth has a new softball coach—the Big Green announced the hiring of Rachel Hanson, the former head coach at the University of Dallas, yesterday. Hanson set a school record for career coaching victories (80) with the Dallas softball team and also served as head coach of the women’s volleyball team, which stands at 12-1 as Hanson leaves the school to start her job with the Big Green tomorrow. Hanson takes over for Christine Vogt, who resigned last month, and will inherit a squad that finished second in the Ivy League North Division last year.
Meanwhile, up in Ithaca, things must be getting really boring, since the athletic department has started a “Break the Berman Record” campaign ahead of Cornell men’s soccer’s contest with Yale Saturday night. A series of promotions, including free t-shirts and drawstring backpacks, are aimed at drawing enough fans to break the nearly-nine-year-old attendance record: a whopping 876 fans. Woah there. Sorry to burst your bubble, Big Red, but here at Harvard, we can get thousands of fans in the stands even without the allure of cheap backpacks.

Cornell won’t be the only opponent the Harvard women’s field hockey team faces on Saturday. It will also take on the fight against breast cancer, dedicating the game and its funding to cancer research and support.The Stick It to Cancer game will feature trivia, contests, and awareness bracelets. Ribbons and cancer fact sheets will be available at the marketing table sponsored by Harvard Athletics.
The Crimson (3-9, 1-2 Ivy) is coming off of a close 3-2 loss to Cal this past Sunday, with junior Georgia McGillivray and sophomore Emma Keller registering goals for Harvard. Standout goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos recorded nine saves on the game, and is currently ranked 20th nationally with 6.58 saves per game and tied for second with a .789 save percentage.
Cornell (8-3, 2-1 Ivy) has won three consecutive non-conference matches and is looking to bounce back in the Ivy League after a 3-2 loss to Yale earlier this month. Game time will be 2:00 pm on Saturday, and although there is a Ivy League match to be won, there is a much bigger opponent that needs to be defeated. Come out and support the Harvard team and the fight against cancer.

If you received an e-mail from FAS IT on Tuesday about a change in your Harvard directory e-mail listing from your @FAS to your @College address, this post will tell you why. If you didn't receive the e-mail, read no further.

"During a recent upgrade of the FAS e-mail account management system your official listing in the Harvard University directory was changed to use your @College address," the e-mail stated.
According to Noah S. Selsby '95, senior client technology advisor for FAS IT, the change was due to an "error in logic" of the new FAS e-mail account management system, which assumed any student with an @College account should have it officially listed in the directory.
As a result, those members of the the two classes who participated in the original @College pilot two years ago and decided not to keep the @college address as their primary address received this change.
"It is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functionality of either account," Selsby wrote in an e-mailed statement. "It simply changes which address is listed in the directory."
The e-mail on Tuesday was sent to notify the affected students in case they should want to change their official listing back to their @fas address. Any students wishing to do so should reply to the FAS e-mail by Oct. 15. Changes will be made to the directory listing on Oct. 19.

Has midterm season reduced your social life to bagged meals from Fly-By (no, the other one) and territorial struggles at Lamont?  If you have unsurprisingly answered "yes" to either of the above, you’re probably looking for a way to blow off some steam this weekend. One possibility: the Club Ex party this Friday night at Adams dining hall, which has been promoted in a recent YouTube ad.
In the video, the dance organization Expressions portrays a group of Harvard students who sit together twiddling their thumbs in silence as a melancholy chipmunk croons Akon’s “Lonely” in the background. Mid head-scratch, one friend suddenly arrives at the solution: “Hey, wait! Isn’t that Club Ex party tonight?” he says. Donning some colorful sneakers, the troupe heads to Adams for—what else?—a raging good time.
If you choose to attend, entrance costs $5 in advance or $7 at the door. The festivities will run, in typical fashion, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.—which might be just enough time to get your groove back.

Recently, Harvard students working late at night have been freed periodically from the distractions of the Internet—or hindered from lack thererof—and will continue to be until FAS IT can figure out the problem.
You may have noticed that nightly, around 11:50 p.m., Harvard's wireless Internet stops working for roughly 15-20 minutes. According to Noah S. Selsby '95, senior client technology advisor for FAS IT, this is not routine maintenance, and the IT department is working to determine the cause of the problem and fix it.
“Our technicians are working on the problem diligently and will be monitoring the situation tonight to further pinpoint the cause and hopefully find a solution as soon as possible,” Selsby said in an e-mailed statement.
Until then, you can take a well deserved brain break at 11:50 p.m.—or pull yourself away from Gmail long enough to get some work done.
