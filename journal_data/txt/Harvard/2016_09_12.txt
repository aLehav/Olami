After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a child, I loved to swim. I found the feeling of gasping for air to be exhilarating, because it reminded me that I was alive. As I felt my heart pump harder to percolate oxygen to my fatigued muscles, all I knew in that moment was the pain. Nothing else mattered—it was a struggle against myself, a struggle to beat back the relentless waves of fatigue and fear of failure. My father taught me what to think in those moments of seemingly everlasting weakness—“dulyeoumen ma-eum ae,” Korean for “fear exists only in the mind.”
Heeding his own advice, my parents brought me to the United States when I was seven. They had everything they wanted in South Korea—a stable job, a loving family, and a country they knew to be home. Yet they were unsatisfied. They wanted to give me a better life and to experience how big the world is. We left with three suitcases filled with clothes and two photo albums—one with pictures from Korea and one for the memories we were going to make in America.
We settled in an area of Queens highly populated by immigrants. I began second grade and discovered an early passion for science. After school, I stayed buried in my phonics book, trying to learn the squiggly letters of the alphabet, while waiting at the cosmetics store where my mom worked. When we got home, I spent hours every day after dinner watching shows like “Ed, Edd n Eddy” and “Dexter’s Laboratory,” repeating each sentence aloud to desperately try to mimic every syllable, sentence structure, and sound.
I was bolstered by a community that rewarded and fostered hard work. Throughout elementary school and junior high, however, I had always known that our presence here was not welcome. One summer evening, I remember hearing my mother’s sobs from the kitchen table in our small one-bedroom apartment. It was late, but not late enough that my father had returned from working his double shift at the Korean restaurant. “Wae ge rae?” I asked. (“What’s wrong?) I gingerly embraced her as she told me there had been “problems with our papers.” I didn’t have the first clue about what that meant, or how it would impact our future. Throughout my childhood, my parents intentionally hid concerns about our status from me. We never spoke of it much; “the problem”—that was how we referred to it, with no explanation or elaboration.
When I was a sophomore in high school, I was accepted to a summer internship at a prestigious research institution in Manhattan. In the middle of the program, the director approached me during lunch with a concerned look on her face. “Could you please come with me?” The sharp clicks of her heels turned into thumps as we entered the carpeted floor of her office. She sighed and looked at me—“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid our institution doesn’t allow foreign aliens to participate in our program.” The words hovered in the air, delayed only by my brain’s refusal to take in their meaning. I felt the confidence and determination drain out of me. I could only manage a feeble “Okay, I understand.”
I confronted my parents that night about what I had been told, and it devastated them. That night was the only time I saw my father cry. To my parents, my success and future was the reason they left their home; my success was inextricably linked to their happiness.
When my parents and I immigrated to the States, we came legally. We petitioned the government and made arrangements to adjust our status through a sponsorship from an eligible American citizen. It turned out that the individual who had sponsored us (my mother’s employer) was not eligible to do so in the first place because she had not paid her taxes promptly. My parents had done nothing wrong. They had followed legal procedures and came to this country to claim a share of America’s promise—the idea that if you work hard and are honest, you can make it. Yet, only a few months after we filed for permanent residency, we were informed of our sponsor’s transgression and ineligibility, and told that the only legal option was to leave the States, and wait out the 10-year ban before re-applying.
For many, undocumented by definition means “border crosser” or “criminal.” However, a substantial portion—between 33 and 50 percent—of undocumented immigrants are visa overstayers. For many, this makes no difference—whether one crossed the border or overstayed their visa, a criminal is a criminal. Legally, however, overstaying a visa is a civil offense—akin to not paying your bills or violating a formal contract. This distinction is especially relevant during this election cycle, where presidential candidates and news organizations alike seemingly throw around these terms without nuance.
The distinction matters because being undocumented is not a singular experience. How an undocumented immigrant experiences her status depends on a multitude of factors, including country of origin, port of entry, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, gender, sexual orientation, and more. This is why calling an undocumented immigrant an “illegal” is not “calling it like it is”—it’s factually inaccurate, and contributes to the inflammatory rhetoric that surrounds the issue today.
Ultimately, my story is one of millions. Millions of lives, experiences, and challenges. But for me, this is personal. I feel a responsibility to share my story because many undocumented immigrants are voiceless, including my parents. They face discrimination, lack of access to health care, and a perpetual fear of the unknown. And many, like my parents, have been swept up by an immigration system that makes it impossible for people to “get right with the law” even if they wanted to. This issue affects real human beings; future discussions must reflect the dignity that they deserve.

As Harvard students returned to campus this fall, they were presented the option of registering to vote as they completed a mandatory online check-in. By virtue of a collaboration between the Registrar's Office and the Institute of Politics, students could either register to vote or request absentee ballots using TurboVote voter registration software. The program proved a success, with 1,400 participants.
This initiative tackles a very real problem: The process of registering to vote can be complicated and daunting, especially for students, many of whom don’t vote in Massachusetts and may also be first-time voters. The University’s proactivity will help pare down the bureaucratic hoops students must jump through, which can oftentimes make the difference between voter apathy and participation.
These efforts at voter registration are not unprecedented. The Institute of Politics has been using TurboVote for years during campus-wide efforts to register students to vote. Similarly, partisan groups on campus have also made their own efforts by canvassing dorm rooms. Voter registration, however, is not a partisan cause, and the College is responding in a centralized manner to an issue that on-campus groups have sought to address  for years.
This problem, however, is not unique to Harvard. Millennials—a demographic which includes college voters—now make up almost a third of the electorate. Despite the political power they wield, millennials are known for their low voter turnout. According to census data, only 46 percent of eligible millennial voters participated in the 2012 presidential election, a number that pales in comparison to 72 percent participation rate among eligible voters from the oldest generation of the electorate.
Given these unfortunate statistics, Harvard's goal of using this new program as a template for other institutions of higher learning seeking to bolster voter turnout is particularly commendable. Voter participation at Harvard aside, the possibility of nationwide reverberations as part of the IOP’s National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement make this initiative all the more worthwhile.
Democracy works best when more people are included, and the College’s voter registration efforts help to ensure this. The 2016 presidential election is highly polarized one, with candidates offering starkly different perspectives on the state of the nation and the direction it should pursue after President Obama leaves office. November’s results will play a large part in dictating the kind of future that young people will work towards in this country. In light of Harvard’s aspiration to educate responsible citizens and even the civic leaders of tomorrow, it is part and parcel of Harvard’s mission to encourage active democracy among its students at such a consequential moment in our history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I grew up a Republican and have slowly edged towards the center—the sort of conservative moderation for which I’ve felt the faux-persecution at Harvard with which only the wolf-criers gallantly risking it all for the establishment can commiserate. But even RINO types like me thought this campus could use a bit of ideological diversity, and we figured ourselves just out-of-step enough with the prevailing winds to feel superior championing that cause. It wasn’t difficult, especially when the face of the right was a garden-variety Bush.
As a result, I have always viewed any sliver of ideological diversity in Cambridge as an unalloyed good. Harvard isn’t exactly an ideological cross-section of the country. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney (a man with not one, but two, degrees from this august institution) barely cleared the double digits among students, and this year, 91% of faculty donations were bound for the Clinton camp.
Of course, ideological diversity gets endorsements in the occasional convocation address by President Drew G. Faust—and from the Republican Club and a few right-wing professors. But, on the whole, inertia and apathy rule the day.
This has always frustrated me, because I believe that a more diverse set of views makes for better debate, richer discussion, and wider outlooks. To be sure, this is painting in broad strokes, but I can’t help but think that section in my government courses would be more dynamic if half of the country were more vocally represented. Let me put it another way: The folks who Dean Khurana loves to say are the citizen-leaders of tomorrow often appear to only be looking to lead those citizens from blue states.
Traditionally, the university resolves these issues by adding a tablespoon of Republicans and stirring. Witness the IOP fellows, where invariably two or three of the six are the token conservatives. Indeed, ideological diversity is often equated with bi- or non-partisanship. It’s why the temporary decamping of IOP Director Maggie Williams to Hillary HQ in Brooklyn has some conservative alumni up in arms.
I could imagine a 2012 version of myself being worked up about those sort of dust-ups. That was before the Donald stepped onto that escalator—and upended my conception of ideological diversity.
In the long, gold-plated list of things to deplore about Donald Trump, the cognitive dissonance he gives me is a pretty minor footnote. Nevertheless, put simply: I don’t know where my policy preferences stop and my principles start.
I’ve sadly found my commitment to ideological diversity fraying. I don’t think my politics have changed, and neither have my arguments for why Harvard needs a loyal opposition. But once mine eyes had seen the coming of the Trump, there was no going back.
Usually, in our firmly entrenched two party system, if I merely dislike the name next to “Republican” on the ballot, my instinctive response is have a lively debate and then cross the aisle. When that name is anathema, and for bigotry and ignorance no less, I simply have no wish to hear the apologists.
For a while, I wondered if that was intellectual cowardice, a desire to curl up in a Fox-free zone. (Dare I say safe space?) Some are anxious to seek out the “true” conservatives as sparring partners, but this too is an exercise in intellectual half-truths. The base voted for the elephant in the room, and it is orange. Sure, he may be a bigot, but is there not some threshold of support and respectability and mainstream-ness – he is the nominee of one of this country’s two major parties, after all – that he has earned? And are universities not places where ideas can be freely debated?
Let me be clear: I think anyone, including Harvard students, has the right to speak in Trump’s defense. Yet the outer bound of the legally possible ought not to be the limits of the desirable. Especially in an academic environment, it is not censorship to tell racism to get lost any more than it was when Bob Dole, George W. Bush, or John McCain did it.
Therein lies the difference between this election year and every other: The Republican nominee’s proposals are so fringe, so offensive, so misguided, and so un-American that their inclusion serves only to push the conversation towards what a recent article in the Columbia Journalism Review called “deviance.”
Trump’s danger is that he drags the deviant into the arena of legitimate controversy. When budget policy and the President’s birth certificate can share a stage, the merger of the fringe and the mainstream is complete, thoroughly complicating any attempt to argue for political balance in an academic discussion. I can keep wishing for more ideological diversity at Harvard, but it’s an impossible ask when separating conspiracy theorists from the “true” Republicans requires a fine-toothed comb and a pair of tweezers.
For me, this isn’t an election to count the number of Ds and Rs on the faculty. It’s an election to be counted, to stand up in favor of principles held even more deeply than any musings on partisan balance. If a commitment to some platonic ideal of ideological diversity requires putting Donald Trump next to Hillary Clinton, treating him like an ordinary conservative, and asking ourselves with a straight face whose tax plan we’d prefer, count me out.

UPDATED: September 14, 2016, at 10:01 p.m.
Campaigning and voting begin Monday for the Undergraduate Council’s fall election 2016 cycle, and 95 students declared their candidacy for the 42 open seats on the body, according to Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
Candidates who are elected to the Council this election cycle will serve on the UC for the remainder of the academic year. Each House and freshman yard typically elects three candidates to the Council, although some Houses have fewer seats open this year because committee chairs, elected during last academic year, hold their positions until the end of this semester.
The total number of candidates running for the UC is lower this cycle than it was last fall, when 136 candidates ran for open seats on the UC. Freshmen—who make up 60 of the 95 total candidates this year—continue to represent the largest group of candidates for the Council. Eighteen sophomores declared their candidacy, along with 13 juniors and four seniors.
Several races will not be competitive this fall. Mather, Kirkland, and Cabot House each have three open seats up for election, and each have only three students who declared candidacy. Meanwhile, each of Dudley, Lowell, and Adams House has one available seat and one student running for office.
In addition, four seats on the UC will be left vacant this fall. In Quincy and Eliot House, three seats are available each, but only two students declared candidacy in each House. In Leverett House, where there are also three available seats, only one student declared her intention to run.
The most competitive elections are those in each of the four freshman yards—Crimson Yard, Elm Yard, Ivy Yard, and Oak Yard. Each yard has three open seats on the Council, and anywhere from 12 to 18 candidates.
Outside of the Yard, the most competitive races are in Currier and Dunster House, each of which has six students running. In Dunster House, where three seats are open, four of the six candidates have previously served on the UC; in Currier House, where two seats are open, three of the six candidates have previously served.
Voting begins Monday at noon and will conclude Friday at noon. Election winners will be announced Friday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some of journalism's biggest names commanding the nation’s most pressing news stories, along with dozens of renowned writers and artists, flocked Sanders Theatre this weekend for a star studded celebration of the Pulitzer Prize’s 100-year anniversary.
Hundreds came out for the event, which the Harvard Nieman Foundation for Journalism coordinated. Ann Marie Lipinski, the organizations Curator and a Pulitzer-winning journalist herself, opened the centennial event Saturday evening, reflecting on the history of the Pulitzer award, the accomplishments of its recipients, and the prize’s “rare position in our cultural landscape.”
University President Drew G. Faust, a 2009 Pulitzer finalist for her widely acclaimed book on the Civil War, followed Lipinski and introduced Wynton Marsalis, the first jazz musician to receive a Pulitzer and the night’s main speaker. He spoke about his award-winning jazz oratorio “Blood on the Fields,” which tells the stories of two enslaved people and their journeys in and out of freedom. He punctuated his speech with joking anecdotes, lessons on the fundamentals of jazz and of life, his own performances with his band.
“Like our Constitution, music calls us to use reason and compromise in pursuit of harmony. It shows us how to balance freedoms with responsibilities, how to seamlessly transition between leading and following, and how to rely on instinct and training to find, nurture and maintain the common ground,” Marsalis said.
Sunday was a three-part program focusing on power at local, national, and international levels. Former Nieman Fellow and Pulitzer winner Mary C. Jordan emceed the day’s sessions.
Journalists Sara E. Ganim and Sacha Pfeiffer spoke in a moderated conversation about their work reporting on sex abuse scandals. Pfeiffer, a member of the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team that exposed decades of covered-up abuse in the Boston Catholic diocese, emphasized how “systemic and systematic” abuse of power can be.
New York Times executive editor Dean P. Baquet moderated a heated discussion with Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and documentary maker Laura Poitras focusing on abuses of government power, the future of journalism, and the responsibility of journalists. Woodward received a Pulitzer for his reporting of the Watergate scandal, as did Poitras for her coverage of disclosures of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs that Edward Snowden leaked.
Other speakers included war photographer Stan Grossfeld, and cartoonist Mark Fiore. Writer Junot Díaz read a selection from his book “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” which explores familial and national life in a country under dictatorial rule.
The day’s programing also featured a videotaped interview between Lipinski and “Hamilton” playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, who reflected on the ability of the arts to tell stories of power and find one’s voice.
Miranda’s interview was a highlight for Aidan M. Fitzsimons ’20, one of a handful of students at Sunday’s event.
“The opportunity to see famous speakers and minds who have hot takes on the broader themes of power is something you can’t miss,” he said.
The event ended with a performance of “The Transmigration of Souls,” which composer John C. Adams ’69 wrote to commemorate the victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
The weekend, entitled “Power: Accountability and Abuse,” was the last of four events held throughout the country over the last year to celebrate the Pulitzer’s centennial. In an interview, Lipinski emphasized how appropriate it was for Harvard and the Nieman Foundation to host the discussion on power and its responsibilities.
“I think every issue that we’ve heard addressed are issues that are at the core of someone’s research here at Harvard,” she said. “They’re about the same questions we are asking as a campus, as a nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pforzheimer House will, this fall, invite three visiting scholars to lead talks and excursions related to historical and contemporary Native American culture.
The program, called the Native American House Fellows program, rolls out at a time when some student advocates have sought to increase its limited offerings in Native American and Indigenous studies. When Harvard’s charter—which remains in effect today— was signed in 1650, the institution made a commitment to educate Native American students.
Shelly C. Lowe, executive director of the Harvard University Native American Program and a new House fellow, said she hopes to bring undergraduates to meet leaders of various Native communities in New England. But because there are few large reservations in the area, students may visit urban Native centers or the Mashpee Wampanoag tribal area in Cape Cod.
One of the new fellows, J. Cedric Woods, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and the director of its Institute for New England Native American Studies, said he has worked with Lowe for seven years and that he looks forward to the residential nature of new House fellows program.
“From day one Shelly [Lowe] and I have been trying to figure out ways to build capacity related to Native American Indigenous studies and support for Native students and Native communities in the region,” he said.
Meredith Vasta, another fellow and the collections steward at the Peabody Museum, said she plans to engage informally with students in Pforzheimer. Because her job as collections steward primarily involves interacting with non-Harvard affiliates, she is looking forward to working with undergraduates.
“I also think it’s a nice opportunity to be able to share sort of what I do and the resources at the Peabody Museum for students,” she said. According to Vasta, half of the museum’s collection is from Native North America.
Lowe said that the residential aspect of the fellows program will allow students to learn about parts of Native culture that may not be discussed in an academic setting, such as traditional food and film. She emphasized her hope that students learn about modern Native life instead of solely placing it in a historical context.
“[I hope] to get students to understand that Natives are here, Natives are contemporary,” she said.
Although none of the fellows could verify that the fellowship program would continue beyond this year, Woods said he hopes that it can and that it inspires similar initiatives throughout Harvard.
“I think that this definitely demonstrates an interest on the part of the House as far as looking to connect and provide broader exposure to their students to Native peoples,” Woods said. “I hope that this inspires other people on campus to do similar type things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 100 people—including young children, undergraduates, faculty, and Harvard staff—crowded the steps of Memorial Church on a windy Sunday afternoon to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Featuring a wreath-laying ceremony and remarks from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, the memorial service, sponsored by the Harvard Reserve Officer Training Corps Association, focused on the power of unity in the face of loss.
Although the deadliest attack on American soil since the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor may feel distant for some undergraduates—most of whom were young children at the time—Luke I. Pumiglia ’17, an Army ROTC cadet and member of the Harvard ROTC Association, said it is important to continue to reflect on the attacks.
“I think it’s easy being on campus, and sort of being in your day-to-day experience, especially for students to forget a lot about what has happened,” he said. “It’s nice to give everyone a little bit of a perspective.”
Pumiglia specified he was speaking individually and not on behalf of the ROTC or the military.
The short ceremony began with the singing of the national anthem by Opportunes member Toni Divic ’17 and ended with a benediction from undergraduate Catholic chaplain Mark W. Murphy. Delivering the main remarks of the event, Khurana affirmed the importance of unity and helping others even in the face of tragedies like Sept. 11.
“Grief and loss are powerful emotions. They’re emotions that have the power to unite us and bind us in both time and space,” Khurana said. “And while they’ve created a sense of unity around this day, and remembrance and reflection, they also inspire us to remain united as a community whenever we face difficult issues.”
Although the ceremony typically takes place within Memorial Church, ongoing renovations led organizers to relocate the event this year.
Matthew Goodman ’18, who is from New York City, said the commemoration was important as he reflected on his childhood memories of that day.
“9/11 was my first day of kindergarten, and I was very fortunate that nobody in my family was directly affected by the attacks, but other members of my school community weren’t as lucky,” he said.
Remembrance of the Sept. 11 attacks was also incorporated into the closing ceremony of the Nieman Foundation’s Pulitzer Centennial celebration, which featured the performance of a musical composition by John C. Adams ’69 originally dedicated to commemorate the first anniversary of the attacks.
An installation of American flags, each representing one of the 2,977 lives lost in the attacks, was also displayed in front of Annenberg Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s bargaining unit is optimistic that it will avoid a strike with its dining services workers this week, but it has a “contingency plan” in place in case negotiations reach an impasse.
According to Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin, the University has a “contingency plan to ensure a minimum of disruption for the community” if its employees go on strike. She did not elaborate further on what those plans would look like. Paul R. Curran, director of labor relations for the University, said meanwhile he thinks he will be able to hammer out a contract with UNITE HERE Local 26—which represents HUDS workers—though the negotiations have already been extended from June. 
“I’m going to stay there as long as they need to get a deal done,” Curran said. “I’m always optimistic that I’ll get a deal done.”
HUDs workers are demanding an increased minimum salary—requesting at least $35,000 per year despite hours worked—and altered health benefits, a topic that has previously been contentious not just with HUDS negotiations, but also with members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Laquiesha N. Rainey, a union organizer and HUDS worker, said last Thursday that she believes Harvard is likely to either hire temporary contractors to supplement any non-union employees within the dining services, or provide undergraduates with vouchers to dine at Harvard Square venues.
A voucher program could be similar to a grant Harvard provided to students on financial aid who stayed on campus over spring break. That grant allocated a total of $225 for the week—$25 per day—to each student to pay for food. Should a similar $25 per day system be implemented, the College could stand to pay almost $167, 500 for the undergraduate student body each day to subsidize dining in Harvard Square.
According to Curran, the threat of an impending strike only minimally affected a bargaining session between Harvard and Local 26 last Friday, days after HUDs workers rallied in support of a strike. He commended the composure of Local 26’s union representative, Michael Kramer, during the session.
Strikes have been few and far between throughout Harvard’s relationship with organized bargaining units, though in 1983, at least 500 food service workers walked off the job.
Peer institutions have previously seen conflicts with their dining services staffs. The most recent food services strike at Yale in 2003 prompted the university to cease dining hall operations entirely. In lieu of preparing food, Yale provided “rebates” for restaurants in New Haven to its undergraduate population for the duration of the three-week strike.
A similar event occurred in 1971 at MIT, when the school was forced to close all but one of its dining halls in 1974 after its cooks embarked on a 26-day strike.
Local 26’s current contract with the University was initially set to expire in mid-June, but the deadline for expiration was extended to Sept. 17 as Harvard and the union continued to bargain over health care and wage increases.
Curran said Harvard has proposed a few bargaining sessions past Sept. 17, but as of Friday had not heard back from the union about whether they will meet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William D. “Bill” Delahunt, a former U.S. Representative for Massachusetts, will serve as the interim director of the Institute of Politics, filling in for Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams while she works for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton.
Williams will take an unpaid leave of absence to co-chair Clinton’s transition team, a move some University alumni have criticized. Williams will begin her leave on Oct. 1 and is expected to return to the IOP after the end of the current calendar year.
In the House of Representatives, Delahunt, a Democrat, represented the 10th Congressional district—which covered Cape Cod, portions of the South Shore, and the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket—from 1997 to 2011, after 21 years as Norfolk County’s district attorney. The 10th district ceased to exist after redistricting from the 2010 census went into effect for the 2012 midterm elections.
A veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard Reserves, Delahunt co-chaired the bipartisan Coast Guard Caucus. He also served on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
According to a press release from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Delahunt has “been a long-time member of the IOP Senior Advisory Committee."
Kathryn A. Bussey ’17, president of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee, wrote in an email that the student leadership team will meet Delahunt when he begins in October and that they are “very excited to welcome him to the Institute of Politics.”
Williams was not the only IOP leader to step away this semester. Executive Director Cathy A. McLaughlin resigned last month to work on the presidential election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students who have been sexually assaulted and want medical professionals to perform an evidence collection kit, which documents physical traumas from the assault, must travel to Boston-area hospitals for the procedure.
Last week, an anonymous op-ed in The Crimson drew attention to one student’s experience seeking medical resources at Harvard after she had been sexually assaulted, detailing how she could not obtain a sexual assault evidence collection kit—sometimes referred to as a “rape kit”—from the University. Her difficulty having an evidence kit performed, according to Harvard officials, is not unique to the University, but a result of Massachusetts law and the absence of emergency facilities at Harvard University Health Services.
“Evidence collection kits are done, and this is true in the entire state of Massachusetts, they are done in emergency facilities,” said Alicia Oeser, the director of Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, which offers counseling and sexual assault prevention resources. She emphasized that Harvard does not offer emergency medical services.
In Massachusetts, a specialized set of nurses conduct the evidence kits at a select number of emergency centers in the state. The regulated governmental process helps ensure that the evidence the nurses collect can be used in future criminal processes, according to Oeser. If there is any error in the evidence collection procedure, the kit’s utility as evidence could be jeopardized.
“It won’t get tested at all until a criminal charge is present,” Oeser said.
Because these kits are police evidence, they do not frequently play a role in University investigations into sexual assault complaints. The results from an evidence collection kit only play a role in the investigation when a student presses criminal charges and decides to share evidence from the criminal proceedings with Harvard’s Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which investigates complaints of sexual assault.
“When you’re talking about these kits, unless there is a criminal proceeding, that kit is not being processed and therefore the complainant doesn’t have kit results to share with ODR,” said Mia Karvonides, the director of ODR and the University’s Title IX Officer. “And so there are no conclusive findings from processing the kit unless it has gone forward in a criminal proceeding and the complainant decides to share it with ODR and then the other party."
The op-ed brings renewed attention to sexual assault at Harvard and the University’s processes for investigating complaints of sexual assault. Last semester, a University task force recommended a number of new programs for preventing sexual assault. A recent graduate also sued Harvard, arguing that it had acted with “deliberate indifference” to her sexual assault complaint. The federal government continues to review the College’s compliance with Title IX.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 12, 2016, at 1:15 p.m.
In the battle for Harvard undergraduates, enrollment numbers from this semester may show Wall Street still has some clout over Silicon Valley.
Continuing a traditionally close competition in enrollment numbers played out each fall, Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” drew slightly more undergraduates than the College’s flagship computer science course Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.” 
According to data released by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office on Sunday, 642 undergraduates are currently enrolled in Ec 10a this fall, just six students more than the 636 taking CS50.
However, when graduate and other non-undergraduate students are counted in the tallies, CS50 enrolled almost 50 students more than Ec 10a, totalling 702 and 647 respectively. Ec10 has traditionally been the College’s most popular fall course, although CS50 did outpace it in 2014.
The third most popular course was the perennially popular Ethical Reasoning 18: "Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory,” with 567 undergraduates and a total of 572 students.
Chinese history professor Michael J. Puett, who this semester is teaching ER 18 for the seventh time, said while introductory courses in economics and computer science give students a foundation for future study, materials in his class delve into topics that relate students’ lives outside the classroom
“It’s a great way for students to—during this formative period—rethink a lot of their basic assumptions about how they live their lives,” Puett said.
The College’s fourth most popular course, Economics 1017: “A Libertarian Perspective on Economic and Social Policy,” saw a significant jump in enrollment to 497 undergraduates from 251 undergraduates last year. Economics senior lecturer Jeffrey A. Miron, who teaches Ec 1017, attributed the course’s jump in popularity to the current election cycle, which has seen Libertarian presidential candidate Gary E. Johnson in the spotlight and rising in the polls.
Miron said topics in the course, like the immigration policy and the legalization of drugs in the context of economics, have attracted students during this year’s presidential campaign—which has featured candidates with significantly varying styles and ideologies.
“These are all things that are discussed actively in the political stage, and I think lots of people are interested to be hearing different perspectives,” Miron said.
Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” maintained its place from last year as the fifth largest course in the College, with 414 undergraduates.
“It’s been increasing, steadily growing every year,” said Statistics Professor Joseph K. Blitzstein, who has taught Stat 110 every year since 2006 except during his sabbatical.
Blitzstein credited the general increasing popularity of statistics for the growth of Stat 110.
“I think the interest in statistics is growing a lot because there’s a growing recognition that everywhere in the world where there’s randomness or uncertainty or data, you need statistics,” Blitzstein said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification: 
CLARIFICATION: September 12, 016 
A previous version of a graph association with this article implied that the course LS1a is the fifth highest enrolled in the College. In fact, that is Stat 110.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team was unable to turn things around after its slow finish in the Beantown Challenge, dropping four games in its road trip to California for the Baden Invitational.
In its four contests, the Crimson only managed to pick up sets in its tilt with Pepperdine, as the squad was swept by Duke, Loyola Marymount, and Arizona State.
“It was a great learning experience...being able to play such high-caliber teams,” sophomore Christina Cornelius said. “We got to see different talent, different plays, and how we can hang with these teams...to help us with our Ivy League season.”
DUKE 3, HARVARD 0
Jordan Tucker led the Blue Devils with 10 kills on the day as Duke rolled through the Crimson defense in a straight-set victory. Cornelius had a game-high 11 kills for Harvard.
“The coaching staff wanted to try me out in a new position,” Cornelius said. “I’ve been working on my passing, as a middle you usually don’t play all six rotations….It’s been tough, but it’s also been a great experience.”
The Crimson failed to eclipse 20 points in any of the three sets. The weekend, however, provided good exposure to the new freshmen on the team.
“At one point, I looked at the court and it was me, Corie, and four freshmen,” junior Paige Kebe said.
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 3, HARVARD 0
With the Crimson still looking for its first set in the contest, a kill from junior Caroline Labanowski late in the first frame on an assist from co-captain Corie Bain evened up the score at 23 points apiece. But the Lions (6-3) roared back, as a kill from Jamie Lea gave Loyola Marymount a one-point advantage. A Crimson attacking error ended the first set in the Lions’ favor.
Victory proved much more elusive in the latter two sets, with Harvard only tallying 14 and 19 points in the second and third frames, respectively. Led by Sarah Sponcil’s game-high 13 kills, Loyola Marymount cruised to a straight-set victory.
Kebe and Cornelius led the charge for Harvard on the offensive side, both totalling seven kills on the night.
ARIZONA STATE 3, HARVARD 0
Down two sets to none late in the third, the Crimson seemed poised to turn the momentum around in its favor. Harvard was able to force extra points in the third set, but a late charge from the Sun Devils (6-3) confirmed the Crimson’s fate, turning the third frame into the final one of the contest.
Cassidy Pickrell and Oluoma Okaro both registered double-digit kills for ASU and only combined for five errors over the course of the contest.
Cornelius and Labanowski topped the Crimson’s attack with seven kills apiece. Rookie Maclaine Fields also notched four of her own.
PEPPERDINE 3, HARVARD 2
WIth the Crimson down 10-8 in the penultimate set, a service error and attacking error by the Waves brought the score to a 10-all tie. But kills from Hannah Frohling and Jenna Tunnell, coupled with an attacking error by the Crimson, gave Pepperdine the separation it needed to close the door on Harvard’s hopes of leaving the the Baden Invitational with a win. Another Tunnell kill and Harvard error handed the set and the game to the Waves.
Harvard had a chance to take an early two-set lead, as the Crimson sat with a 23-22 lead in the second frame. But two straight errors saw Harvard’s one-point advantage turn into a one-point deficit. Another error—this time by the Waves—evened the game, but a kill from Tarah Wylie followed by yet another Crimson error allowed the Waves to tie the game at one set apiece.
The Crimson turned the tables in the third set, breaking a 26-all tie with kills from Cornelius and Bain. Freshman Grace Roberts Burbank forced the extra points with a kill set up by Bain with the Waves leading 25-24 at that juncture.
“Grace adds so much to our team,” Cornelius said. “She’s a great passer and hitter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You can beat them once, but a second win in a row is a little tougher to come by.
Late last season at the Varsity 7s Championships, the Harvard women’s rugby team suffered its first of three loses at the tournament to the Navy women. Even though the Crimson jumped out to an early 10-0 lead, the Midshipmen came back to beat Harvard.
Things ended a little differently this time around. The Crimson won its season opening match this weekend, beating Navy 32-7.
“It was a tough game,” junior captain Maya Learned said. “We drove nine hours [which] is really tough on your body. To come out after just a few weeks of practice to be able to do what we did...I was really proud of us.”
Though Learned was elected and served as captain during the 7s season this past spring, this was her first 15s game as captain. She was joined as on-field captain by senior Claire Collins.
“[Learned and Collins] contributed a lot in leadership and in keeping the team in the right mindset,” sophomore Caitlin Weigel said. “They just did a great job of being leaders by example.”
An important factor for the Crimson was the contributions of the more experienced players on the team. Collins opened scoring in both halves, tallying two tries on the day. Junior Haley Langan and 7s standout Weigel both recorded tries on the day as well.
“Claire had an incredible game,” Learned said. “She is able to control the field of play...to make herself get across that line. She’s been really fantastic. She’s really taking on a huge role in being a leader on the team.”
While the leadership and experience of the older players certainly helped Harvard, the newcomers were not to be outdone. Even with only a few weeks of practice under their belts, they provided a significant contribution. Min Kim, a sophomore who joined in the spring and therefore has yet to play true 15s rugby, scored a try to match Collins’ and Langan’s in the first half. Freshman Robyn Beese tallied the final score of the day.
“We have several girls coming in with a lot of experience…. We also have a whole new group of walk-ons” Learned said. “The level of excitement and willingness....creates a really good environment for success.”
That being said, class year goes out the window when the players step between the lines. After jumping to a 5-0 lead early in the game, Harvard retained the lead throughout the match. In fact, the Crimson never let Navy  within one try after going up 10-0.
“Our work ethic is [a] big factor in our success,” Learned said. “Everyone was trying really hard on the pitch.”
That was evident early in the match. After Collins’ opening score, junior Langan and Kim each built on the early lead with a try apiece making the score 15-0.
Being the first game of the season, it wasn’t perfect. Though Harvard jumped out to an early lead, the Midshipmen cut into the Crimson lead by scoring and converting a try to make the score 15-7 just before halftime.
“We had quite a lot of handling errors, dropped balls and stuff,” Weigel said, “but that’s to be expected when it’s your first time playing with each other…you aren’t sure who’s running where or at what speed.”
Navy’s momentum wouldn’t last long, though. The Crimson shot out in the second half to extend its lead, riding the power of Collins to make the score 20-7. Weigel scored the lone conversion of the day for Harvard as she extended the Crimson’s lead to 20. Beese sealed the victory for Harvard in the final minutes, propelling the Crimson to an undefeated start.

Playing in their third road game in eight days, the Harvard women’s soccer team had as good of an excuse as they have had all season to start out flat against Providence on Sunday afternoon.
Instead, the Crimson did just the opposite, overcoming fatigue and the Friars’ momentum coming into the game to launch 10 shots in just the first half. The consistent offense turned into a goal right before intermission, as sophomore defender Leah Mohammadi converted an opportunity in front of the net to put Harvard up 1-0.
Senior forwards Rachel Garcia and Midge Purce added goals in the second half before Providence pulled one back. From there, the Crimson saw out its 3-1 advantage with ease.
The win marks Harvard’s (3-3-0, 0-0-0 Ivy) first road victory of the 2016 campaign, as it had lost its two previous games away from Cambridge, to Louisville and Boston College. The Crimson are now in a position to salvage a split in its string of four straight road games when it plays at New Hampshire on Thursday.
“Playing three games in a little more than a week was obviously a challenge for us,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “But we took away good lessons from the two losses before this game and applied them to win tonight.”
The Friars (4-3-1, 0-0-0 Big East), meanwhile, fell back to earth after recording four straight shutout wins. Over that stretch, they had outscored their opponents 9-0.
Against the Crimson, however, they had trouble jumpstarting their offense. While Harvard had 10 shots in the first half, Providence only had two in that same time frame. The Friars finished with seven shots and just three corners for the entire game.
“All over the field, we were extremely compact and each line worked well together and stayed connected,” Crimson co-captain Carly Rotatori said. “Being able to transition together effectively was key to preventing them from breaking through and having chances on goal.”
The low offensive output by Providence marked a turnaround for not just the Friars, however. Harvard’s defense also rebounded well from its previous two matches, in which it allowed a combined six goals.
On the other side of the field, Purce led the Crimson offense just as she has all season so far. She recorded an assist to go with her late goal, bringing her total output to five goals and one assist in six games.
Harvard’s first tally, which came in the 42nd minute, featured a great centering pass from Purce. She rolled a dangerous ball into the box and across the goal, and Mohammadi capitalized to put the Crimson up. For Mohammadi, who has mostly been used as a defensive substitute in her two seasons, the goal was the first of her collegiate career.
Then, in the 84th minute, Purce did it all herself, as she took the ball at midfield and ran all the way into the box before slotting past Providence senior goalkeeper Kristyn Shea. The goal was Purce’s third unassisted score of the year, continuing to show her ability to create her own shot.
Garcia also added a goal, making her the team’s second leading scorer this season after Purce. Garcia now has two goals to go with an assist. On the other side, senior forward Rachel Ugolik was responsible for the Friars’ only goal, and the Providence attack did not challenge the Harvard goal–which was missing co-captain Lizzie Durack–much beyond that.
“[Starting senior goalie] Lizzie [Durack] didn’t play, but we have faith in all of our keepers and they played well today,” Hamblin said. “Dani [Etzel] and Kat [Hess] both did a great job for us.”
Each goalie played one half, with each making one save as they worked with the defense to neutralize the Friars’ attack. Together, Etzel and Hess guided the Crimson to the victory.

Harvard faced a 4-0 loss against some of its stiffest competition of the past few years this past Sunday against No. 4 Connecticut (5-0). This is the first ranked team the Crimson (2-2) has played this season and their highest ranked competitor until they play No. 13 Boston University in a few weeks. Harvard last played the Huskies in 2009, falling 6-0. Despite the one-sided scoreboard, Harvard came away from the game with a performance that proved it could compete with the ranked teams on their program.
“I think the biggest takeaway for the season that we have from the game today is that we should not have to pay respect to any team out there,” said coach Tjerk van her Waarden. “We should not be intimidated because we can compete with every team on our schedule for the rest of the season.”
The Crimson entered the second half of the game down 0-2 but gave a better offensive performance with three attempts at goal from freshman forward Maddie Earle, junior midfielder Hannah Wellington and freshman forward Bente van Vlijmen. The Connecticut home team proceeded to score twice within three minutes despite sophomore goalkeeper Libby Manela making a string of saves.
“Even though the score didn’t show it, I think that walking away from today really showed us that we can compete with a top scoring team in the nation,” captain Sarah Finnemore said. “It’s a great takeaway from the game.”
The second period of the game also saw Harvard gain two penalty corners compared to the Huskies’ one.
“For such a top team, really had a great showing,” Finnemore said. “Since freshman year our team has really grown and improved a lot, I think everyone at different points stepped up and pulled their role on the team, I think it just worked really well.”
Earlier in the game, sophomore Amanda Collins of the Huskies led Connecticut shut out against Harvard by scoring nine minutes into the period. She proceeded to record her second multi-goal game of the season by slotting another goal into the back of Harvard’s net three minutes later.
“I think overall we held ourselves well,” van her Waarden said. “We made a couple small mistakes and knew ahead of time that it would be the details that made all the difference and where we could prove ourselves well. Small details is where we’ll work hard on – we need to be more effective in the circle and on both ends of the field we give [the opponent] too much space defensively. That space is what a top team is going to capitalize upon.”
The Crimson looks on to play Northeastern and Massachusetts on Friday and Sunday respectively. Both teams bring different challenges for Harvard – the Crimson and Northeastern have traded victories over the past few years. On the other hand, the Massachusetts Minutewomen lost by only 1-0 against the Huskies last week.
“They’re two local teams which makes the games very exciting,” van her Waarden said. “Northeastern is a very well coached team and they have a playing style that works well with us and I think it will be an exciting time on Berylson Field on Friday evening. UMass is the next stage of opponents that we want to measure ourselves with so I’m very excited to get after it again and show what we can do as Harvard Field Hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a season that culminated in its first Ivy League championship in 41 years, the Harvard men’s golf team kicked off its campaign with a sixth-place finish at the Doc Gimmler. The event was hosted by St. John’s University, and took place at Bethpage State Park’s Red Course in Farmingdale, N.Y.
The Crimson walked away with a score that put the group at 12 strokes over par overall. Rhode Island came out champions, finishing at 15 under par after 72 holes of play, while Seton Hall took home the runner-up position, five strokes off the leader’s pace.
“Building on a lot of the momentum we picked up during the season last year, a lot of the upperclassmen are already dialed in,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Being super sharp is pretty necessary as far as when scoring will come along, and right now we are medium sharp…but I am comfortable with how our progression is coming along.”
The Bethpage Red Course measured at 7,092 yards and played at a par 70 for the tournament. Two rounds were played on Saturday in humid weather conditions with temperatures hovering near 90 degrees for most of the day. Sunday featured one morning round.
Taking third was Harvard’s Ancient Eight rival Yale, who arrived at Bethpage as the defending Doc Gimmler champions. This time, the group combined for a 9-under par score of 831. The only other school to finish below par was UConn at seven shots below par.
Villanova rounded out the top five, finishing one shot ahead of the Crimson.
On the individual side, Harvard was led by junior Greg Royston. Royston used a round three 66 to carry himself 20 spots up the leaderboard Sunday, earning a share of seventh place at 2-under par. Royston was particularly strong on par five holes, carding a cumulative score of 5-under par, the second-lowest mark for any participant.
“One of the great things about last year is the success we experienced really enhanced the excitement we all feel about this team and its potential,” Royston said. “We are all very much on the same page, buying in to our coach’s message, and ready to give it our all for this season.”
Senior Kendrick Vinar channeled his inner Royston in round three as well, shooting 15 slots up the standings Sunday en route to a tie for 19th overall. Sophomore Seiya Liu came out of the gate hot in round one, firing a 69, good enough for a ninth-place tie after the opening 18 holes. He would finish the weekend in the 39th position after rounds of 73 and 75 to finish his tournament.
Just behind Liu was freshman Rij Patel, checking in at 42nd in the field of 78 competitors. Rounding out the team for Harvard was captain Daniel De La Garza.
“One thing I think is really fortunate for us right now on the men’s side of things is that we are very deep from a personnel perspective,” Rhoads said. “Everyone on the team now really knows what they are doing and how to go about doing it.”
UConn’s Jimmy Hervol came away with the individual title, riding a round three 65 to overcome the challenge of Rhode Island’s Dawson Jones, who finished three strokes back.
Harvard did its best work in the short game, ranking behind only Rhode Island and Yale on par threes. Despite Royston’s par five success, the Crimson as a team could only manage an eighth-place ranking in that department.

Opening up its fall slate of play, the defending Ivy League champion Harvard women’s golf team traveled to Annapolis, Md., to take part in the Navy Fall Invitational. Building on the strong finish to last season, the Crimson walked away with the first-place finish, leading a pack of 16 schools from across the nation.
“It’s always huge for us to get out of the gate with a good finish early on in the season,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It’s really a confirmation of what we’ve been working on, and it provides us with a good opportunity for confidence building in the form of tangible results.”
The tournament featured two rounds of play over the weekend. Harvard came out of the gate hot, firing a round one 304 on Saturday, good enough for a six-stroke edge over Towson, Penn, and host Navy. That round one score, at 16 strokes over par, was the lowest single round score for any team at the event. The Crimson’s Sunday score of 311 was tied for the top slot with Towson, sealing a six shot Harvard victory.
Penn finished third overall, eight shots off the Harvard pace and two behind Towson. Also comprising the top five were Sacred Heart and Navy, finishing at 626 and 630, respectively.
The Naval Academy Golf Course, measuring at 6,085 yards, played at a par 72 for the weekend. Only two players were able to turn in under par rounds in the tournament. Sacred Heart’s Ellen Nighbor and Wagner College’s Pascalle Tego each carded a 71 in the first round.
The event was the first time the Harvard women have played at the course during Rhoads’ tenure.
“We were very impressed with the layout of the course, but the course played a little tougher on day two in the second round,” Rhoads said. “The scores were relatively high, which reflects a number of different factors. The greens played a lot slower that what we are used to, so that in combination with the wind being a bigger factor on Sunday probably had an influence on what the scores ended up being.”
On the individual side, captain Anne Cheng led the charge for Harvard. Despite missing the Friday practice round due to the MCAT exam, Cheng finished in a tie for fifth place with Yubin Huh of Penn. Both players were models of consistency, shooting plus-4 76 on both Saturday and Sunday.
“A lot of us actually didn’t get to play that much golf over the summer,” Cheng said. “So it’s important for us to work on sharpening our games early on in the season. We work with each other and our coaches especially on some of the more technical aspects and the mental part of the game.”
Fellow Crimson senior Nina Fairbairn and sophomore Michelle Xie both ended as part of a four-person tie for eighth place overall, joined by Wagner College’s Ariana Furrie and Quinnipiac’s Alexandra Sazhin.
Sophomore Anna Zhou finished tied for 17th, while freshman Chloe Belle Hooton rounded out the Crimson squad, riding a round one 76 to a tie for 31st place.
The women will take a two-week hiatus before traveling to the Princeton Invitational at the outset of October.
“This is definitely a great starting point to our season to come out with a strong finish out of the gate,” Cheng said. “But obviously we have plenty of room for improvement, and we are going to keep going out and trying our best to strengthen our game and adapt to new courses and challenges in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to set the tone for the young fall season with strong performances across the board, the Harvard sailing team posted four top-10 finishes in five regattas in its first weekend of action.
“We definitely have a young team this year, so we’re just looking to getting to face that good competition and do as well as we can,” sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky said.
With spots in key positions having been vacated by last year’s graduating senior class, the Crimson’s youth was on display throughout the weekend. But members from all experience levels of Harvard’s squad kicked off the season with a solid effort.
“We want to maintain our level of excellence from past years,” junior crew Kevin Coakley said. “Despite losing a very talented senior class, we brought in a promising freshman class, and everyone across the board is trying to rise to the occasion and fill up some open spots that we have.”
PINE TROPHY REGATTA
Racing for a spot in the New England Match Race championship in an in-conference regatta hosted by the Coast Guard Academy, fellow juniors—co-captain skipper Nick Sertl, crew Dylan Farrell, Coakley, and crew Taylor Ladd—finished in second place in the eight-school field.  Needing to claim fourth place to qualify for the championship, the Crimson was able to do just that.
The current on the Thames River in New London did not play much of a factor in the final outcome. Variable wind conditions ranging from 5-10 knots on Saturday and 10-18 knots on Sunday were more impactful, but the group fared well considering that they were racing in a relatively unfamiliar type of vessel.
“J70s are a type of boat we don’t normally sail in college,” Coakley said. “And for finishing second we qualified for the New England Match Race Championship in October. So we’re pretty happy that we did really well there.”
Yale was the ultimate victor of the contest after scoring 45 total points. Harvard and Dartmouth tallied 51 and 58 points, respectively, to round out the top three.
TONI DEUTSCH REGATTA
The Crimson also raced to a solid result in the weekend’s only all women’s regatta hosted by MIT on the Charles River, finishing in sixth out of the 13 schools at the event. The B-Division led Harvard in the event with its 59 total points and four first-place finishes in 13 possible tries.
The A-Division placed more consistently than its Crimson counterpart in its 10th-place, 103-point divisional result, helping Harvard to its 162-point tally.  Brown, Yale, and Connecticut College placed in the top three spots with their 67, 69, and 77-point performances, respectively.
HARRY ANDERSON JR TROPHY
The Crimson was unable to live up to last year’s fourth-place result in this Yale hosted inter-conference, bi-divisional regatta, after finishing in 12th place in a field of 17 teams this weekend. Although the B-Division picked up steam towards the end of racing, it was not enough to make up for the hole that the squad had put itself in.
Both Harvard divisions combined for 320 points in 30 total Z420 races throughout the weekend, well behind Boston College’s winning mark of 153.
LARK INVITATIONAL
In a bi-divisional promotional regatta hosted by Tufts, the Crimson claimed its only regatta victory on the weekend.  Freshman skipper Jessica Williams helped lead the charge and pulled out her first career win for Harvard in the event.
In the early goings of the regatta, it seemed as if the weather might have made for some tough racing, but it soon turned and conditions became much more satisfactory.
“[Saturday], right as we went out start racing, we got held up by [the conditions] and ended up having to wait about an hour for that to clear,” Karnovsky said. “But after that it brought in beautiful breeze for the rest of the day.”
Karnovsky’s pairing posted 63 points in the A-Division, while Williams and sophomore crew Divya Arya tallied 76 in claiming victory in the B-Division. The group’s combined 139-point mark was good enough to best second place Tufts by 40 points.
FJ INVITATIONAL
A single day home regatta on the Charles River did not help guide the Crimson to a victory in its final racing of the weekend, as this contingent of sailors posted a 66 points en-route to an eighth-place result.
Racing in only 10 total events throughout the regatta, the stakes were high as any individual event could affect the entire outcome of the race. But Harvard’s results in both the A-Division and the B-Division in consistently were the fifth-to-seventh place range.
Tufts brought home gold in the regatta, as Boston College and Northeastern finished close behind for second and third, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 12 Harvard swept the weekend to go 3-0 at the Princeton Invitational in its second weekend of play on the season. The Crimson has had an unprecedented start to its season, dropping only one game out of the first seven and notching four wins against nationally ranked opponents.
“It’s the second week in a row that we’ve beat the tenth rank team in the nation. Last week we beat UC Davis who was the tenth ranked team at the team this week we beat UC San Diego,” sophomore Grant Harvey said. “We were ranked 14th now we are ranked 12th is the best starting position Harvard has ever had.”
Harvard 15, Fordham 4
Harvard dominated against Fordham on Sunday to complete a weekend sweep. Chiapello and Harrison led the offensive attack with four and three goals respectively. Harrison recorded his fifth hat trick on the year. Colton, who leads the team with 17 assists, guided the offense with a game-high four assists.
Sechrest, Bunn, and freshman Charlie Owens each got on the board multiple times. Colton and freshman Bennie Seybold each scored to round out the goals.
Defensively, the Crimson shined letting up a season-low of four goals and recording 14 steals as a defensive unit. Wrobel, Harrison, Bunn, Sechrest, and Owens collected two steals apiece. Suri and sophomore Anthony Ridgely split time between the pipes totaling five saves together.
“We played three good games. We are playing good defense and scoring enough goals to win,” Harvey said. “We have plenty of offensive power, our team issues are definitely defensive so focusing on our defense instead of having just pure offense is important. So we played well, and we are very happy with how we played this entire weekend.”
Harvard 12, UC San Diego 10
Harvard displayed its depth in its win over No. 10 UC San Diego earlier in the tournament. Five different Crimson players got on the board twice while junior captain Harry Tafur and Chiapello tallied three assists apiece.
“A good thing about this year is that we have our all stars from years passed, Joey Colton and Noah Harrison. But something special about this year’s Harvard team is that we all just play together as a team,” Harvey said. “There weren’t any breakout performances from this weekend we just played good team water polo, as Ted Minnis referred to, good family ball.”
Colton led the offensive attack in the first quarter scoring two goals to give Harvard a 4-3 lead. Senior Dan Stevens scored the only goal in the second quarter to match the Tritons and tie up the game 5-5 at the half.
The Crimson came back strong after the intermission with two goals from Wrobel and one from sophomore Nick Bunn to gain back the lead 9-7. One more goal from Stevens and two from Harrison in the final quarter secured the victory for Harvard.
Harvard 13, Air Force 12
The Crimsn defeated No. 15 Air Force in overtime on Saturday. Harvard took the lead early in the game, controlling the play for most of the first half. Seniors Viktor Wrobel and Joey Colton scored two goals apiece to end the second quarter 6-2 in the Crimson’s favor.
The Falcons bounced back, narrowing the deficit to 8-6 in the third quarter. Air Force continued to chip away at Harvard lead in the fourth and took it late in the contest. The Crimson responded and tied it up at 10-10 when captain Joey Colton found classmate Noah Harrison late in the fourth.
Harrison scored in both the first and second overtime to force a sudden-death. Harrison came up big again when he forced a steal in man down situation allowing junior Colin Chiapello to score on the counter-attack and win the game.
“Our standout moment was taking Air Force to double overtime and winning it in sudden death,” sophomore Nathan Ondracek said. “Which was great, it was a big win for us.”
Freshman Austin Sechrest had an impressive four point performance with a career-high three assists. Classmate Nikhil Suri dominated in the goal, stopping eight shots.
