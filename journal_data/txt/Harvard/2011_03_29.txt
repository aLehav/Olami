After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Artwork about religion is never neutral. There is always some message that the artist feels the need to communicate with his or her audience. This is not a bad thing: some of the greatest artwork ever created was prompted by the desire to communicate intense feelings of spirituality. Even outside the category of explicitly religious works, art has been used to express and explain philosophies from atheism to multi-culturalism. “Skinwalking,” the senior thesis of writer and director Cecelia A. Raker ’11, places itself within the discussion of art and religion not as a vehicle for expressing religious sentiment, but as a way of exploring the similarities between Judaism and Christianity. It’s an intriguing concept, but the play gets bogged down in needless obscurity. In the end, the work’s central themes of love, faith, and religion are only partially addressed.
“Skinwalking” centers on Mari (Xanthia  A. Tucker ’13), a young lawyer who comes back to her rural hometown after her grandmother’s death to reoccupy the family house. As she rejoins the community, her rational atheism is shaken to the core by encounters with people who may or may not be analogs of biblical characters. These include José (Eduardo J. Perez-Torres ’12), who might be Joseph, and Blessed Mother Mary Full of Grace (Jasmine J. Rencher ’11), both of whom are first encountered in a Dunkin’ Donuts. Mari slowly begins to see that religion does not necessarily stand in contrast to rationalism, and her faith rekindles. Intermittently throughout the show a ‘skinwalker’ (Rebecca H. Kwan ’14), a physical representation of the characters’ doubts and fears, creeps across the stage in an attempt to take their skin—a diverting device that is never fully explained.
Overall, the acting in “Skinwalking” was solid, but it was hard for many of the characters to shine given the roles that they were playing. Both Rencher and Perez-Torres played their parts admirably, but were unable to  explore their respective characters fully because the script doesn’t let them develop. They remain in stasis throughout the entire show. This same problem affects Ana (Sara S. Lytle ’13), the ghost of Mari’s mother. Towards the beginning of the first act she acts out, for the most part silently, the story of her love affair, drug addiction, and eventual suicide. However, this scene comes not only before we have been given an opportunity to sympathize with the character, but also before we can even place her within the overall framework of the play. What could have been a heartbreaking scene ends up looking like it was included purely for its shock value.
The suicide scene was very well-executed and the use of physicality rather than dialogue to move the plot forward was refreshing. Throughout the play, the director incorporated physical theater into the action on stage. By far the best example of this, and the best performance in the show, was by Kwan as the skinwalker. She used the grace and physical control of a dancer to create a creature that was scary, animalistic, and oddly compelling. She immediately grabbed the audience’s attention every time she went on stage.
The most fundamental problem with the play, though, was its unnecessary theatrical pretension. There is no apparent need for half-English, half-Spanish conversations, or for the language to abruptly switch to Shakespearean English when modern English is just as beautiful. Most frustrating of all, Raker is clearly a very talented writer. The best scenes in the play by far were the ones where two characters are simply having a conversation because the writing was clear and the characters could develop. During large sections of the play this quality of writing was buried underneath overwrought literary devices.
Thus “Skinwalking” is the disappointing end result of a very good original idea. The themes of personal love and loss used to describe and explain the relationship between humanity and God is fascinating. However, it is impossible to appreciate these central themes when they are obscured by superfluous affectations.

Elusive French writer Georges Perec may have died in 1982, but thanks to the recent reissue of an oft-forgotten literary experiment from his later years, his humor and his cunning live again. Published in book form for the first time and translated into English by Perec’s biographer, Princeton’s David Bellos, Perec’s delightfully odd “The Art of Asking Your Boss for a Raise” paints a playful portrait of the neurotic corporate mind as it attempts to construct a logical template for financial success and—in a more abstract sense—human recognition.
Originally published in 1968 in the French journal “Enseignement programmé”—and subsequently adapted into a later chapter of what is perhaps Perec’s masterpiece, “Life: A User’s Manual”—“Asking Your Boss” will interest any reader who has ever worked in a large bureaucracy and considered himself underpaid.
With Perec’s signature irony, the deep philosophical questions this little small book poses have little to do with the often overwrought themes of anonymity or alienation that others have emphasized in their own depictions of corporate culture. Indeed, for Perec, those questions are merely as follows: what day would be best for me to see my boss? What do I do if he doesn’t ask me to sit down when I come in? Should I or should I not attempt the personal angle by asking some half-baked questions about his daughter?
On that superficial level, at least, “Asking Your Boss”—just 80 short pages from start to finish—will tease as much as it entertains. But due to the book’s brevity, its subject, and its cheekiness, it might be too easy to read the latest iteration of the great Georges Perec simply as a mischievous indictment of the corporate mind and the culture that has spawned it. Although “Asking Your Boss” is certainly such an indictment on a superficial level, its real value comes not from its subject but rather from the mode in which that indictment is expressed.
Without any capitalization or punctuation, “Asking Your Boss” might seem at first like an 80-page run-on sentence, especially given that, in large part, the text—which amasses thought after thought after thought without any pause or break—requires a fair amount of concentration to decipher. But this, in a sense, is precisely the significance of Perec’s project in “Asking Your Boss,” and the book must be understood and celebrated as a rare literary artifact of the Oulipo movement, which was just establishing itself in the 1960s. Ouvroir de littérature potentielle—“Workshop for Potential Literature” in English and “Oulipo” for short—was founded by novelist Raymond Queneau and and mathematician François Le Lionnais in 1960. The attempt by several European writers and mathematicians, mostly French, to gauge the implementation of mathematics in literature created a new form of expression, informed by logical process and quantitative patterns. In the words of Bellos, Oulipo “sought to invent new kinds of rules for literary composition, and also to explore the use of now-forgotten forms in the literatures of the past.”
In the works of the Oulipo writers, these “new kinds of rules for literary composition” often included devices such as the palindrome; the “S+7,” a construction in which every noun in a given text is replaced by the noun seven entries below it in the dictionary; and the lipogram, a word game in which long passages are written without a particular letter. Among his other accomplishments, Perec is said to have immortalized the lipogram throughout the course of his work.
It makes sense that Georges Perec—born in Paris in 1936 and coming of age around the time when Queneau and Le Lionnais were experimenting with mathematical literature—would take so well to Oulipo. By the mid-1960s, Queneau had already written “A Story As You Like It,” a narrative experiment in which the reader is presented with a sentence and then prompted to choose one of two responses that dictates the length and content of the story he or she ultimately receives. The result is a construction that contains within itself the permutations for a multiplicity of narrative threads.
According to Bellos’s account of Perec during these years, the writer was intrigued by the idea of creating a story that generated itself from a body set of programmed choices that occurred at what might be called “plot points.” And we see that interest throughout the brief duration of “Asking Your Boss,” which, as Bellos has noted, mimics the “progress of an imaginary computer-mind as it iterates a set of choices in pseudo-real time.” Hence the lack of punctuation and capitalization: the text is a deliberate attempt to imitate the linear jumble and logical string of corporate thought, rendered here in the language of a computer.
Take, for instance, the first few lines of the book: “having carefully weighed the pros and cons you gird up your loins and make up your mind to go and see your head of department to ask for a raise so you go to see your head of department let us assume to keep things simple – for we must do our best to keep things simple – that his name is mr xavier that’s to say mister or rather mr x…”
The idea of weighing the “pros and cons,” the phrase “let us assume,” and assigning a variable name to the unknown “mr x”—these are immediate signals that Perec’s imaginary employee approaches his dilemma just as any functioning computer would. Indeed, he identifies his problem, isolates his variable, and, from there, determines the proper course of action as dictated by logical progression.
What is perhaps most intriguing about Perec’s experiment in “Asking Your Boss,” however, is the way in which he uses his form and his content as a means of commenting on the very bizarre relationship the two share in his text. In fact, a strange effect of reading this difficult and witty exercise is that the reader is teased into believing that there is hardly a distinction between the one and the other. For Perec, it seems, content is form, and form is content. On the one hand, “Asking Your Boss” is ostensibly ‘about’ the neuroses of the corporate mind. But on the other, what matters about that mind the most is the transcript of its thought processes, the roadmap of its progress from cubicle to boss’s office to cubicle. In a sense, the mind is its paper trail, an idea that gets at the heart of the Oulipo ideology.
As a witty indictment of corporate culture and an artifact from one of the 20th century’s most bizarre literary movements, “Asking Your Boss”—as with all the works of Georges Perec—is a puzzle too absurd not to explore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A convoluted scheme to win a lifetime of true love is perfectly executed—but all for naught—in “Yeomen of the Guard; or, The Merryman and His Maid.” The theme of ironic hopelessness is the target of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ (HRG&SP) Spring 2011 production, which opened on Thursday and runs until April 3 in the Agassiz Theatre. As the 11th of the duo’s 14 collaborations, “Yeomen” is one of librettist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan’s most critically acclaimed works—but this production could have done it a bit more justice.
The plot of the opera revolves around  Colonel Fairfax (Ian H. Clark ’12), an alleged alchemist who has been sentenced to die in one hour. But an adoring fan of his, Phoebe Meryll (Cassandra L. Rasmussen ’13), will have none of it. With her father (Eric Padilla ’14) and brother Leonard (Dylan J. Nagler ’14), she hatches a scheme to save his life. But when jester Jack Point (Daniel W. Erickson ’14) and his lady Elsie Maynard (Marit A. Medefind ’12) get involved, the chaos begins.
Both the vocals and hilariously over-the-top performances are impressive. While the opening number, sung by Rasmussen, gets the show off to a slow start, the casts’ performances improve soon thereafter. A number of performances stand out above the rest. With a part whose size does not adequately exhibit her gorgeous singing voice, Katherine E. Moon ’14 shines as Dame Carruthers. As two of the male leads, Clark and Padilla display vocal and dramatic savvy.
But the performances of Erickson as the theatrical jester and Benjamin T. Morris ’09 as the pathetically desperate assistant torturer deserve the highest praise. These two masters of physical and vocal comedy command the stage and do much to preserve the humor of the play—which, as implied by a note in the program from director Devon H. Dunn ’12, was not the central focus of this interpretation. “For this production I wanted to play with the bittersweet plot and emphasize the dark setting,” Dunn writes. It could be precisely this divergence from a comedy-centric approach which accounts for the production’s lackluster quality.
Moreover, blocking and choreography seem to have been given very little attention. Actors display a lack of directorial awareness when they are left with awkward moments devoid of motion at the heads and tails of songs. Furthermore, the would-be grandest of the numbers are rather drably executed, with cast members either singing in a straight line with no movement, or clumped in awkward, aesthetically unpleasant groups.
The set, designed by Matthew G. Warner ’13, does not do much to alleviate the situation. While the walls of the tower are impressively realistic in texture, their design disorients any sense of interior and exterior. The rest of the set feels similarly unmatched to the show’s dramatic requirements. A large but relatively short platform takes up the majority of the floor space, leaving little standing room; it is rarely used, and never to great avail. The platform occupies space that could otherwise have been used for more engaging choreography.
Though music director Ethan T. Addicott ’14 adeptly controls the dynamics and phrasing of the pit orchestra, its position behind a wall on the stage leaves the music sounding weak and muffled. The string section struggles to keep up with the challenging opening overture and suffers other tempo-related setbacks throughout the play. Overall, however, the score—often praised as Sullivan’s best—is relatively well-executed.
In typical HRG&SP fashion, the Janice J. He ’11-designed costumes are period-perfect and impressive. These are complemented by a range of convincingly intimidating torture devices procured by properties designer Susanna B. Wolk ’14.
Ultimately, this year’s “Yeomen” shows all the signs of great potential not used to its capacity, and a lack of directorial experience is seemingly to blame. The fine efforts of the cast allow for an enjoyable experience, but the staff’s failure to match up to their players results in a production that does not deliver the spectacle for which Gilbert and Sullivan so consistently strive.

‘The environment’ is a loaded term. Bring it up in conversation and expect absolutism on either end of the political spectrum—or, the listener will just tune out completely. But in the past five years, the environment has surprisingly dropped out of the national conversation, a trend that quickened about contemporaneously with the 2008 recession.  Environmental consciousness, it seems, is a luxury. Reflecting on the attention paid to Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth,” it is clear that the environmental zeitgeist has subsided. With this in mind, T.C. Boyle’s latest novel, “When the Killing’s Done,” is like a relic from days of yore. Here is an intelligent novel that not only succeeds as a work of fiction, but also aims to raise cultural awareness about the fine distinctions between environmental conservation movements.
“When the Killing’s Done” is essentially an extended love letter to the Channel Islands off the Santa Barbara coast in California. Returning to the multiple perspectives he uses in his previous works, Boyle introduces and develops an array of characters, who all have some intimate association with the islands. Boyle spans ages and generations in this portrait of the locale. But the core dramatic tension is between National Park Service biologist Alma Boyd Takesue and local businessman Dave LaJoy. Alma wants to systematically remove ’invasive’ animal species such as rats and wild pigs from the islands, while LaJoy, a self-appointed protector of all animals, will stop at nothing to save them.
The narrative structure is digressive, which allows the reader to understand the full complexity of the various characters’ relationships with the Channel Islands and with one another. As in his last novel, “The Women,” Boyle has a strong interest in the female experience, especially when his female characters come into conflict with men who are unreliable or overly confident of their knowledge and abilities. He conveys the individuality of his characters in a remarkably fluent manner by changing his intonation from character to character from the breathless exuberance of Alma’s grandmother, Beverly, to LaJoy’s ramblings, which invariably escalate into rage.
“When The Killing’s Done” has many commendable qualities. His writing exudes a passion for storytelling and nature alike. But at times the scope of the novel stretches the reader’s stamina to its limit. Boyle’s digressions into his characters’ psyches gives the novel an immense emotional depth, but sometimes punctures the narrative’s momentum. For example, when Beverly is shipwrecked at sea, Boyle embarks on an extended description of her memory of seeing a shark strung up on the pier. His descriptions, while deeply impacting, tend to become redundant.
Boyle’s heavy-handedness extends to the plot, as well: the tussle between Alma and LaJoy is transparently allegorical. Alma, representing order, is so rigid about population control that at the start of the novel she includes humans in her list of ‘parasitic’ species. The troublemaking LaJoy expresses a more liberal temperament by sporting dreadlocks, a renegade attitude, and fury: “Yes, he took his blood-pressure medication and no, he didn’t take—will never take—the Xanax.” LaJoy is clearly the more imbalanced of the two. But as any high-school chemistry class will tell you, entropy dictates that natural systems tend towards greater disorder. The conclusion is forgone: once the forces of nature have been set in motion, it is impossible to stop them. Boyle illustrates this with the counterpoint of the island of Guam, which is irrevocably overrun with snakes.
Contingent to the issue of uncontrollable nature is the degree of human prerogative in ordering the natural environment. This is expressed in Alma and LaJoy’s escalating quarrel; Alma wants to atone for humankind’s interference and destruction of nature. Her version of ecology is ‘shallow,’ focusing on concrete, achievable goals. But even her solutions are inadequate. One of the cleverest tricks of the book is that at first it seems like Alma’s only interest is eradicating the rats—but then she wants to remove pigs. It becomes clear that, despite the novel’s title, the killing will never be done. And even though she is successful in eradicating target animals, removing them from the already changed environment has unforeseen effects. LaJoy wants to leave everything as it is, which is arguably not such a bad solution, since Boyle implies that the island can never be restored to its original state anyway. Boyle’s outlook on the conflict is ambiguous and suggests that there is no right answer.
The ambivalence of the novel leaves the ultimate moral of the story up to the reader. Boyle, who indulges in gorgeous descriptions of the islands, is always quick to undercut any incipient sentimentality about them. Despite the fact that nature has been changed as a result of human intervention, Boyle shows that nature is not a passive victim. Humanity’s seemingly firm mastery over the natural world is illusory, despite the reassurances of running water, electricity, and available shelter. A lobstering cruise out to the Islands turns deadly when the weather turns; ignoring warning signs by crumbling cliffs leads to a character falling off a cliff. Although all the characters in the novel are aware of and—to varying degrees—embrace the unfriendly side of nature, they cling to the idea of wilderness as Eden. They allow natural beauty to lull them into a false sense of tranquility. But that is, in a way, Boyle’s point: removed from nature, human existence is safer and more predictable, but so antiseptic that nothing is really left: hence the constant attraction of the inviolate and remote Islands. Boyle does not browbeat the reader into environmental consciousness, but rather engages her in relevant environmental issues.

Bathsheba Monk is generally talented at toeing the line between platitude and profundity. But the prose in her debut novel, “Nude Walker,” occasionally stumbles across that line, and the results can be nauseating: “The North is the land of ice; the South, the land of fire and passion. If ice mates with ice, there is only more ice. And if fire mates with fire, there is a conflagration. But ice and fire make water and life.”
To be fair, not all of  “Nude Walker” is so painfully cliché. It does, after all, have a scene in which a naked schizophrenic—the main character’s mother—struts around rural Pennsylvania bedecked with little more than a handbag and red lipstick. But by indulging in this kind of purple dialogue so early in a love story, Monk writes herself into a stylistic predicament that is hard for the novel to recover from. Especially when it’s a love story between an American woman and Lebanese man, a supposedly smoldering tale of doomed passion, East and West, North and South, so familiar that the book seems to almost be a parody of itself. Certainly, parts of the story are intended to be tongue-in-cheek, especially the aforementioned schizophrenic and her litany of medications; her husband, who embezzles $30,000 from his wife’s steel company; and the last Lenape Native American, running a love-shaman enterprise, complete with spirit bears. The simplicity of the characters in “Nude Walker” adds to the sense of parody; few of them have credible levels of emotional complexity, in spite of their idiosyncrasies. Yet despite Monk’s cheeky attitude toward her characters, “Nude Walker” does not quite cross the line into actual parody. There is something too earnest in the love story and its tragic end, in Monk’s clear affinity for the inhabitants of Warrenside, Pennsylvania. The reader instead is left with the creeping horror that she might actually be serious. Ultimately, her paper cut-out characters and the lack of depth in the narration leave this matter ambiguous. Though the story Monk narrates is at times wonderfully wise, and her characters consistently entertain, the inconsistency of her tone prevents “Nude Walker” from succeeding either as humor or a serious novel.
The novel begins in Afghanistan, where Kat, a female soldier descended from wealthy steel entrepreneurs in Warrenside, falls in love with Max, her unit’s translator, from the same town. Of course, Kat has a childhood sweetheart to whom she is practically betrothed, and her schizophrenic mother would be absolutely horrified if she brought home an Arab-American. And, of course, Max’s hyper-traditional father has already arranged a marriage for Max with a beautiful Lebanese girl, and wants him to take over the family business. Instead of developing a believable romance between Kat and Max, however, Monk relies entirely on familiar clichés—Max is a dark, exotic stranger, sensitive and and intellectual, gifted at quoting Arabic love poetry. Chick magnet.
But thankfully, the scope of ”Nude Walker” is not totally confined to their fate. Instead, as they return home from Afghanistan, the story blossoms into a narration of the tensions between their families in Warrenside. As the events unfold, Monk offers the perspectives of a range of characters. While each character seems blown wildly out of proportion, at least each is interesting, and each is treated with equal humanity. There are many stereotypes in this book—among them a Native American “love-guru” who induces dreams of dancing bears in her clients through “shamanic methods,” and an crazy, rich, old woman absorbed by her family’s role in the history of the town. Yet, the author’s attitude toward them is affectionate and thoughtful, even if it is occasionally fraught with stereotypes. Monk seems to examine each stylized man or woman as they come into the story with care, then to send them into the mysterious wheel of fate. The story Monk weaves is one that is genuinely interested in people and how they live, and though her characters lack real dimension, their anguishes and motivations are plausible. The arbitrariness of fate in “Nude Walker” rings uncomfortably true in the midst of all the clichés, because the way each character is served in the end does not align with any predictable plot or poetic justice. Rather, fate in this book has an ironic authenticity—no one gets what they deserve, because life is not fair, only surprising. It is an uncomfortably realistic and thoughtful end for a book wavering on the edge of parody. The final product is discord and confusion about Monk’s intentions.
There is some genuine warmth and wisdom in Monk’s ideas, in the things her characters are searching for, and the malicious hand that guides the fate of each.  But, ultimately, it seems to be the warmth and wisdom of someone who likes telling too many stories in a coffee shop without ever probing the humanity of the people who inspired her stories. Monk may be making fun of her characters in the wry way she constructs their streams of consciousness. But in doing so she asks us to identify with their yearnings and believe in the wisdom of the destinies they’re dealt. Sadly, without the necessary depth in any of her characters, these ambitions prove too lofty for Monk to surmount.

As the glittering chandeliers dim in the Lowell House Dining Hall, the lemon-yellow walls and checkerboard floors recede out of view and the chorus begins: “Fa Re Fa Si La Sol Fa Fa / Be welcome in Westphalia! / A scene of sweet simplicity, / Teutonical rusticity: / All hail, Westphalia!” If anything, “sweet simplicity” is a cruel joke for the unsuspecting operetta-goer. “Candide” is, in fact, a rigorous exercise in absurdity—a series of unfortunate events that takes its players on a ridiculous journey through Lisbon, Paris, Cadiz, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, “Eldorado,” and Venice on sinking boats, flying machines, and various other means of conveyance. A humorous and versatile cast overcomes the technical and spatial limitations necessary to producing such a globe-trotting show in a dining hall to deliver the operetta’s bawdy mockery of ‘l’optimisme.’
The work has a rather turbulent history, much like its naïve protagonist. “Candide” is one of three operatic works by Leonard Bernstein ’39, a towering figure in 20th-century music who is yet remembered more for his contributions as an influential conductor and public cultural icon than as a composer. Based on Voltaire’s satiric novella “Candide, ou l’Optimisme,” the operetta opened to generally unfavorable reviews as a Broadway musical in 1956. The libretto was then rewritten by Hugh Wheeler in 1973, with additional lyrical contributions from Stephen Sondheim, John Latouche, Lillian Hellman (who authored the initial libretto), Dorothy Parker, and Bernstein himself. This production of “Candide,” directed by Erin Huelskamp, music directed by Lidiya Yankovskaya and Aram V. Demirjian ’08, and produced by Ashley N. Kaupert ’12, Anh M. Lê ’12, and Chappel L.W. Sargent ’12, is the first for the Lowell House Opera.
The work chronicles the trials and tribulations of Candide (James B. Onstad ’09 in three of the six performances), the bastard nephew of a Westphalian baron (Brandon Milardo), as he attempts to court and marry the baron’s virginal daughter Cunégonde (Liv A. Redpath ’14 in this performance). Throughout his journey, Candide seeks to reconcile the brutal ugliness of human nature with the optimist teachings of his private tutor, the philosopher Pangloss (Anthony Garza). After years of globe-trekking, war, torture, slavery, wealth, poverty, and sexual abuse, Candide and Cunégonde ultimately retire to the Venetian countryside to live as subsistence farmers.
Several individual performances characterized by great comedic timing and vocal finesse propel this production forward and provide its main source of entertainment. Redpath is the clear vocal standout. Her crystal-clear tone, near perfect intonation, and a tragic-cum-endearing ethos in the classic showpiece “Glitter and Be Gay” turn it into the evening’s musical highlight. Ana Maria Ugarte is hilarious as the Old Lady, the daughter of a Pope and one-time princess who is missing half her buttocks but who maintains a cheerful outlook despite years of rape at the hands of pirates and an overambitious eunuch. Garza is tasked with creating not only Pangloss, but also several other roles, including the pessimist Martin and Cacambo, Candide’s manservant acquired somewhere between Buenos Aires and “Eldorado.” Garza’s Pangloss is unctuous, his Martin ghoulish. His campy Cacambo bears an eerie resemblance to Agador Spartacus from “The Birdcage.”
The production’s design reinforces the latter comparison: as if to emphasize the tongue-in-cheek naughtiness of Wheeler’s libretto, the Mark Buchanan-designed set resembles a cabaret, or even a gentleman’s club. With red velvet draping, vanity lighting, and a wall of mirrors, this backdrop underscores the sexual innuendo that pervades “Candide.” If the cabaret setup is clever, other staging choices are hit-or-miss. When Candide and company sail to the New World at the end of Act One, a chorus of supporting actors holds scrolls of glossy blue fabric high above the cast in a rather stale representation of the ocean. When Candide buys and sells golden sheep from the magical world of “Eldorado,” however, these fuzzy friends were humorously depicted as Beanie Baby-like stuffed animals tossed across the stage to enact the trade of goods. So while some aspects of “Candide” were kitschy or conventional, others work perfectly well as humorous commentary.
“Candide” does have some shortcomings. In a small dining hall where the orchestra pit and audience occupy the same floor space, the orchestra’s blare can easily overwhelm the singers. And some vocalists certainly had trouble projecting above their accompaniment. The orchestra, skillfully led by Demirjian, also experienced some problems with intonation, especially in the string and brass sections in the “Overture” and Candide’s lament in Act One. Still, these faults do not detract significantly from an otherwise engaging production, the merits of which are due in most part to Bernstein’s witty and melodically striking songs, straddling the line between high art and slapstick comedy.

April 1-3, 7-9, 8:00 p.m.
Loeb Mainstage
Directed by Illinca Radulian ’11
Produced by Annie E.M. McGrath ’13
With actors splashing paint and navigating through water onstage, it’s safe to say that the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s (HRDC) version of Christopher Marlowe’s “Faustus” is anything but traditional. “Faustus” is the story of a man who, in a search for eternal knowledge and power, sells his soul to the devil but is soon plagued by regret and uncertainty. The production uses aesthetic elements to convey the characters’ predicaments visually. “The staging isn’t realistic, or particularly natural. We’re trying to make it as metaphorical as possible, and paint is a fantastic medium for that,” says director Ilinca Radulian ’11.
HRDC’s adaptation of the show also breaks with the traditional by placing females in conventionally male roles. Isabel Q. Carey ’12, who plays Mephistopheles, a devil summoned bv Faustus,  says that this feature brings a different perspective to her role in particular. “I think it colors the relationship between Mephistopheles and Faustus in a very interesting way. It helps me make the character more dynamic as I navigate between being both a symbol of evil and a former human with personable qualities,” she says. Also playing traditionally male roles are Vanessa B. Koo ’12, Kelly E. Perron ’11, and Darcy C. Donelan ’14, who together play Lucifer. “There are a lot of power imbalances and power struggles in the show, and playing around with gender roles makes it a lot more interesting,” says Koo.
The version of “Faustus” premiering in the Loeb next week is a radical adaptation of the original, which allows for more comedic moments and a different tone altogether. “We tried to make it as simple as possible,” says Nasir W. Husain ’12, who plays the title character. “What I would hope is that the audience is moved by a love story built out of a text that wasn’t necessarily designed to be a love story."

Despite the myriad movie adaptations of Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” dating back to 1914, both director Cary Fukunaga and actress Mia Wasikowska of the 2011 cinematic update of the novel claim to have been utterly ignorant of their existence. “I was amazed there were so many versions of film,” said Fukunaga, though he sees no reason to end the trend. “Why do we do anything? Because it’s good storytelling,” he added.
For those unfamiliar with the book, “Jane Eyre” tells the story of a young orphaned girl who lives in the moors of England with her cruel cousins and unloving aunt. She is eventually sent to an even more inhospitable boarding school, where she comes to learn that her vitality and passion for life are frowned upon among her gender. After graduating, she takes a job as governess at Thornfield Manor, the estate of the mysterious and intimidating Mr. Rochester. As Jane looks after his illegitimate foster child Adele, she begins to explore the secrets of Thornfield and its inhabitants, particularly Mr. Rochester.
Most importantly, though, “Jane Eyre” is a powerful love story centered around the principles of trust, vulnerability, and equality—qualities to which Fukunaga stays true.  Fukunaga recalled that when he was growing up, “there were no racial minds or class lines in [Berkley, California].” This relative equality left him unaware of the depths of social inequality and exploitation around the world until further education in high school, college, and his time in the United Kingdom. “In the U.K., they are hyperaware of class,” he said. “I began to pick up on the sort of unspoken class prejudices there.”
In his movie “Jane Eyre,” Fukunaga emphasizes the aristocratic structures that separate Jane and Rochester. Through most of their interactions, Rochester speaks in convoluted and cryptic sentences, employing a wider vocabulary than Jane and often leaving her confused. Fukunaga also populates his film with many shots of Jane observing Rochester from afar, unable to engage fully in his life of privilege.
In her novel, Brontë portrayed Jane as a woman frustrated by her lack of physical and social mobility, and this aspect is taken up by Fukunaga in “Jane Eyre,” whose script includes key lines expressing Jane’s desire for action, her desire to be like men as well as to be around them. In her portrayal of Jane, Wasikowska delivers these lines with the urgency of someone who fears that life’s best experiences will pass her by.
The pale-faced and wide-eyed Wasikowska does an excellent job of embodying the strong yet naïve Jane. The 21-year-old actress from Australia, who resembles a cross between fellow Aussies Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett, is best known for her work in Tim Burton’s visually elaborate “Alice in Wonderland” and the Academy Award-nominated “The Kids Are Alright” (dir. Lisa Cholodenko). But this role has a more personal resonance; Wasikowska sought it out before she even knew if there was a film adaptation in the works. “I hadn’t actually read [“Jane Eyre”] until I picked it up in 2009,” she said. “I was halfway through and thought it was incredible, so I got in touch with my agent and asked if there was a script around.” Two months later she received Fukunaga’s script and joined his project.
The role of Wasikowska’s romantic counterpart, Rochester, however, took some searching. After seeing Michael Fassbender’s work in Steve McQueen’s “Hunger,” where he portrayed the Irish republican hunger striker Bobby Sands, Fukunaga was piqued and eventually cast him for “Jane Eyre.” Asked about her co-star, Wasikowska said that Fassbender is ideally suited for Rochester because he “has the qualities of being both potentially dangerous and also really vulnerable and loving. It’s easy to work off of him because you believe him. He’s so natural.”
The film’s strongest supporting performance comes from Hollywood veteran Judi Dench (“Quantum of Solace,” “Pride & Prejudice”), who plays Rochester’s housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax, a woman whose benevolent veneer conceals her sharp, perspicuous judgment. Dench’s Fairfax offers a sturdy anchor for Wasikowska’s Jane not just in the film, but on set as well. “She instantly disarms you,” Wasikowska said of the 76-year-old Dench, “so the intimidation didn’t last long. She’s a young spirit.”
Though the cast is strong in its own right, their characters also come alive due to the environment they inhabit. Filled with shadows and flickering candlelight, the feel of the film preserves Brontë’s gothic tendencies and casts an alluring yet frightening pall over the proceedings. “I just want to keep it as naturalistic as possible,” said Fukunaga. “You know, just keep it raw and simple.”
Fukunaga’s experience as a cinematographer becomes apparent over the course of the movie. The director said he wanted “the film to be centered around the tete-a-tete between Jane and Rochester,” and in this he succeeds. Oftentimes the audience feels as though it is intruding on the intense conversations between Jane and Rochester, as the two lean towards each other and the camera swings perilously between them and their tumultuous emotions.
Living up to Brontë’s iconic novel is a difficult task, something not lost on the makers of “Jane Eyre.” “Literary [adaptations] are more of a risk,” said Fukunaga. “You just have to hope people accept your interpretation.” Ultimately, the hope is that the film’s unique qualities of cast and production will justify it. By placing Wasikowska and Fassbender in a world full of foreboding mystery and poignantly illustrating their attempts to accept their respective vulnerabilities, Fukunaga looks to have his “Jane Eyre” do justice to its classic namesake, and take a respectable place among the long line of film versions of the story.

For a legal drama starring a man best known for running around shirtless on the beaches of Malibu, “The Lincoln Lawyer” is surprisingly engaging and suspenseful. Matthew McConaughey has woken up from his B-movie coma and proven that he can act in a serious dramatic role.
The film, directed by Brad Furman and based on the book of the same name by famed crime novelist Michael Connelly, stars McConaughey as Mick Haller, a street-smart criminal defense lawyer who works out of his Lincoln Town Car in Los Angeles. While casting McConaughey as a stiff corporate attorney from New York would never have worked, he makes for a superb smooth-talking lawyer with a southern drawl, as charismatic and comfortable on the streets as he is in the courtroom.
At the beginning of the film, Haller learns that Louis Roulet (Ryan Philippe), an arrogant but desperate young real estate mogul accused of murdering a prostitute, is willing to pay him a large sum of money to defend him in court. Haller accepts, and his own life thus becomes dangerously tied to Roulet’s intricate crime family, which includes his scheming and controlling mother, Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher). Roulet himself appears manipulative but innocent; Haller, however, soon unearths his true motives, motives that force him to confront his own personal ethics and history.
For a movie with so many intertwined plots and flashbacks, the acting is fairly straightforward and, for the most part, authentic. Ryan Philippe is not particularly likeable as a Beverly Hills ‘bro,’ but most self-entitled, apathetic young men from 90210 are not. His character is believably poised between lackadaisical and frantic—he can’t go to jail, just can’t, not when there are Maseratis to drive and women to woo at bars. Marisa Tomei, as Haller’s ex-wife, plays a hard-edged career woman with little artistic creativity, but it is a character so hackneyed that none is expected—and her surprising candor and chemistry with McConaughey is refreshing.
It is McConaughey whose latent, unexpected ability to act—or maybe just choose a film with a good plot—carries “The Lincoln Lawyer” to surprisingly thrilling heights. He is best when allowed to stretch his comedic wings instead of brooding over legal documents. Whether popping a bottle of Ibuprofen to cure a hangover or outsmarting his client in the courtroom, McConaughey’s bad-boy affectation is pitch-perfect. His character brings to mind Josh Holloway on “Lost,” whose portrayal of James “Sawyer” Ford, another slick Southerner with a penchant for ladies and drinks, was coupled with surprising intellectualism and wit.
For all his efforts, McConaughey can’t always overcome John Romano’s somewhat uninspired script, whose dialogue can’t quite keep pace with its plot. Forced to make earnest emotional statements like “I’ve got to make it right!” and “You know what I’m afraid of now? Evil. Pure evil,” a few of his lines can seem stilted and unnatural. Some heavy-handed courtroom testimony, especially from Mary Windsor, hurts the script with its unintentional hilarity. That said, for the most part, the film’s exchanges—especially Haller’s legal machinations and interactions with his ex-wife—are believable and well-written.
The cinematography fluctuates between the pseudo-artistic and the sweepingly grand. On the one hand, director of photography Lukas Ettlin is overly fond of close-ups and use of the hand-held camera. Both techniques make sense in certain scenes, as when Haller wakes up hung-over or goes on an emotional visit to see an incarcerated former client. There, the immediacy of the camera forces the viewer to relate to his troubled perspective. At other times, though, these gratuitous techniques are disconcerting and erratic—why the viewer needs to feel dizzy while walking through office cubicles, for example, remains a mystery.
Where the cinematography works is at its bombastic best. With its sprawling overhead shots of Los Angeles’s maze of highways, gritty scenes of street life, and pulsing bars and clubs, “The Lincoln Layer” successfully evokes a sense of urgency in the city’s dry heat. Majestic confrontations between Haller and Roulet are set against the city skyline, giving their battle of wills a larger-than-life feeling, while the impressive view from Haller’s bedroom of the city nightscape makes his own decisions resonate beyond the scope of his personal battle.
The film’s inexhaustible supply of plot twists and unexpected outbursts of violence is jarring but admirable in its efforts to confound the viewer. It would be easy to mock Roulet’s last name, a seemingly obvious allusion to the deadly Russian game. Yet unpredictability defines every aspect of “The Lincoln Lawyer,” from Haller’s unconventional relationship with his ex-wife to horrifying revelations about clients he has promised to defend at any cost.
And, what is most surprising, in nearly every scene, McConaughey is wearing a shirt. Did the famous fitness aficionado tone down his workout regimen while filming? Or has he actually decided to start relying on his talent rather than good looks to get by? Whatever the truth, his performance is superb. And that may be the film’s most astonishing twist of all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In  2006, director Zack Snyder decided to pull out all the stops of traditional cinema. He determined that the world needed more gory comic-book style battle sequences, he realized that the best commentary on the oversexualized nature of our media today was to inflate that characteristic to an unrealistic level, and he discovered that short, memorable one-liners are the most important aspect of dialogue—and so he made “300.” Unfortunately for “Sucker Punch,” these very same techniques did not work their magic the second time around.
Snyder first introduces protagonist Baby Doll (Emily Browning)—a girl framed for the murder of her sister—when she is entering a mental asylum. The stepfather who brought her there pays extra for a quick lobotomy, but as the doctor (Jon Hamm) is about to do the deed, her consciousness frees itself—and Baby Doll finds herself in an imagined brothel with no way out.
The sets for the brothel and the madhouse are exactly the same, the people in charge and their purposes are the same, and the inmates are the same people. The only visual difference between these two realities is that the characters get to wear sparkly clothing in one, and marginally less revealing clothing in the other. All of which begs the question: why does Baby Doll create an alternate reality for herself which is also, essentially, a prison?
But instead of addressing this tantalizing concern, the film continues to further confuse the matter and its viewers. In order to get out of this new entrapment, Baby Doll accesses another dreamworld—that is, for those keeping track, a dreamworld within a dreamworld within reality. Cycles of senseless violence ensue. Wait, haven’t we seen this movie before? For a director who prizes conceptual and visual originality, Snyder proves surprisingly derivative in “Sucker Punch.”
Each time the movie transitions to a different reality, with the music thumping in the background, one half expects a “Level 2” graphic to pop up and a video game controller to materialize out of nowhere. But this is a movie, and it often seems as though no one had any control over its next move. The script is of little help; even its wise old man figure (Scott Glenn) provides scant guidance. “You have all the weapons you need,” he tells Baby Doll and her companions, “now fight.” Unfortunately, this is about as profound as “Sucker Punch” gets.
Dialogue is not the only vacuous element of the film. Somehow, Snyder has managed to take good actors and make them shallow. As Baby Doll, Browning betrays no facial expression throughout the movie, and her big blue puppy-dog eyes look vacantly up at the audience throughout, as though asking for some sort of artistic pity. Oscar Isaac, who plays the pimp of the brothel dreamworld, somehow turns his stereotypically sleazy role into a pitiful shadow of the real menace that his character could have become. And Carla Gugino’s performance as multiple characters is so confusing that one gets the impression that the actor had no idea what it was about either.
The film’s few performance highlights are Abbie Cornish as Sweet Pea and Jena Malone as Rocket, sisters who accompany Baby Doll and evince actual emotion, seeming to genuinely care about each other. Cornish and Malone are but two of Snyder’s pants-averse posse of femme fatales who battle their way through his virtual realities with all the realism of Lara Croft. Accordingly, the film’s visuals are stunning and rival the best of today’s video game imagery, even offering occasional moments of truly comic destructive glee—as when former Disney sweetheart Vanessa Hudgens hacks into zombie Nazis with a battleaxe.
Snyder and company have the right ideas—they just have too many of them. “Sucker Punch” had the potential to be a superb and inventive commentary on the objectification of women or on the human mind, or even just a fun anime-style action flick. Instead, it becomes a mess of video-game references, sequins, and general confusion. The wise old man’s clichéd advice to the girls before they go into battle is sadly too pertinent for the film itself: “If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything.”

“Win Win” is a winner. Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy delivers with his third feature, thanks to the superb performances of Hollywood stalwart Paul Giamatti and newcomer Alex Shaffer. An unconventional family drama, the film tugs at the heartstrings while making use of authentic characters and quirky dialogue to avoid the pitfalls of cliché and its story’s occasionally implausible plot points.
Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty, an elder care lawyer who coaches high school wrestling at night. Short on cash, Giamatti commits to becoming the legal guardian of his most wealthy client, Leo—played by the wry and cantankerous Burt Young—after he learns that it will net him an extra $1,500 a month.
Even then, everything seems to be falling apart for Giamatti. In addition to struggling with his law practice and failing wrestling team, he has stress-induced chest pains and a smoking habit. Matters continue to worsen until the arrival of Leo’s 16-year-old grandson Kyle Timmons (Alex Shaffer), a troubled wrestling prodigy trying to escape his drug addict mother (Melanie Lynskey).
“We have kids, Mike, I’m not taking chances with Eminem down there,” Mike’s wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan) says, as Kyle shacks up in the basement. Despite the potential danger of hosting the tattooed teen, the family takes him in. Writer/director Tom McCarthy’s Eminem reference is particularly apt, as Shaffer has said he would listen to the rapper to channel the anger required for Kyle’s character. Like the Flahertys, McCarthy took a leap faith in taking on Shaffer, whose acting resume consisted only of his 6th-grade appearance in Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance.” His lack of dramatic experience, however, is easily balanced by his real-life experience: Shaffer became a New Jersey state wrestling champion just before production for the film began.
Though Shaffer is new to the acting game, he becomes the angsty Kyle effortlessly, forming a “Blind Side”-like bond with Giamatti, whose progression from self-sabotaging lawyer to proud father is both heartwarming and genuine. These performances are crucial, as with a low budget and improbable storyline, “Win Win” is highly dependent upon quality acting—making McCarthy’s casting choices of Giamatti and Shaffer inspired ones.
Candid and authentic supporting characters also drive McCarthy’s writing forward. Giamatti’s quick-witted young daughter (Clare Foley), who opens the movie with a series of profane remarks, and Giamatti’s best friend Terry Delfino’s (Bobby Cannavale) cheating wife and subsequent mid-life crisis both provide much-needed comic relief.
These actors’ genuine delivery on screen can be attributed to McCarthy’s painstaking work habits and devotion to the messages conveyed by his writing and filming. A famed perfectionist, McCarthy is known to agonize over an individual line for hours simply to ensure that it is something that one of his characters would utter in real life. His determination to make the film’s characters perfect—and therefore, imperfect—surfaces throughout “Win Win.” The people in the film feel real, even on those occasions when the story does not.
McCarthy’s careful effort clearly pays off. His third feature project is both surprising and witty, striking the perfect balance between high school sports movie and family drama. It is the rare film that can comingle laughs and an improbable plot with deeper themes of masculinity, familial loyalty, and the responsibilities of parenthood. Refreshing and inspiring, “Win Win” will likely move even those moviegoers who showed up just for the wrestling rush.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In spite of the thousands of words ... recorded in our ponderous dictionaries, there are some that seem still to be needed, among them one to define the modern taxidermist ... whose work can only be considered as art because it certainly is not nature.” So wrote Frederic Lucas in 1927.
Lucas, who was a natural historian, a taxidermist, and the Director of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)in New York, struggled to assign artistic implication to taxidermy, a term which etymologically means ‘moving skin.’ The attempt to situate taxidermy in the realm of creativity is complicated by the conflicting roles involved in its creation and appreciation. The artistic nature of taxidermic preparation depends on the intent of an object’s creator. Moreover, a taxidermied object itself can be understood alternatively as art, trophy, or research specimen based on the context in which it has been placed.
LIFELIKE IN THE DETAILS
In his early adulthood, Lucas worked as an assistant for Ward’s Natural Science Establishment, the business that supplied Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) with many of its taxidermied specimens in the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. Founded by Louis Agassiz, the MCZ is an institution dedicated to the understanding of evolutionary and ecological relationships between organisms. It falls under the umbrella of the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH), the public face of three research museums. Largely due to expeditions taken by Ward’s Natural Science Establishment and other companies centuries ago, the HMNH has a collection of taxidermied primates, as well as many endangered or extinct animals now protected from hunting. In an age of nature documentaries and zoos, museums such as the HMNH still provide academics and members of the public alike with the opportunity to come face-to-face with animals they would otherwise never encounter.
“Taxidermy is brilliant,” says Judith Chupasko, Curatorial Associate in Mammology at the MCZ. “It’s a good way to preserve an animal so people can see what it looked like when it was alive, and a good taxidermy mount can last hundreds of years.” Successful taxidermy is often considered the ability to make a specimen appear as lifelike as possible, whether the intent is to depict accurately its size, features, and posture, or to represent the ‘essence’ of the animal. “You have to be an artist to make an animal look lifelike,” Chupasko says. “Animals are fluid and move gracefully. To capture that movement in a dead animal means that in some way you’re bringing the dead back to life.”
Working for commercial, scientific, or artistic purposes, taxidermists abide by essentially the same technical process. First, they receive an animal that has died after being shot by a hunter, injured in an accident, or collected for scientific study. An intensive procedure ensues. The taxidermist skins the animal, takes precise measurements of its carcass, and tans the animal’s hide in order to preserve it.
The category of scientific taxidermy includes specimens made for both public displays and research collections. For the latter, preparation differs slightly; skins are often simply flattened, and there is no attempt to recreate the appearance of a living animal. Research collections also preserve the skeleton and a tissue sample, from which DNA can be extracted. “With research preparation, you’re a little stymied in terms of being creative, because the point is to produce specimens that all look the same,” says Professor Hopi Hoekstra, Curator of Mammology at the MCZ.
On the other hand, Hoekstra says, specimens prepared for public display offer opportunities for artistic expression. Created for museums, homes, and competitions, these objects require an armature to be built precisely following the measurements taken from the original animal. While modern-day warehouses supply Styrofoam forms with a degree of particularity that differentiates between upright whitetail deer and semi-upright whitetail deer, taxidermists a century ago made their own mannequins from wood wool, plaster, and wire. Details have remained important: glass eyes, for instance, must be species-specific. Taxidermists often have hundreds if not thousands of reference photographs of animals—their eyes, ears, noses, fur patterns, and muscle structure.
THE PLASTER UNDERNEATH
“Taxidermy is in a way like a particular kind of sculpture,” says Professor Ivan Gaskell, whose class—United States in the World 30: “Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History”—examines how objects other than texts can be used to explore and write history. The course incorporates an exhibition, housed in the Science Center’s Collection of Historical Instruments, featuring several taxidermied specimens. “Taxidermied animals have the appearance of tremendous verisimilitude,” Gaskell says, “but they also make you think about artifice ... The whole of the interior is completely different from that creature when it was alive. In some of the older specimens in the MCZ, you can see that artifice because the specimens are decaying.”
Indeed, while mounts can last centuries, they often have to be renovated: teeth crack, fur dulls, and skin decays, revealing the plaster underneath. The giraffe at the HMNH, for example, now has duct tape reinforcing the hide on its neck. However, because of animal protection regulations, the museum cannot simply commission a new giraffe, meaning many of the decaying animals on display are the only ones available for public viewing. This problem raises a question: is the art of taxidermy found in its product—the lifelike specimen—or is it in the act of artificially reproducing the animal?
According to Gaskell, the desire to make specimens appear as lifelike as possible resulted in the production of dioramas, such as those in the famous Akeley Hall of African Mammals at the AMNH. Regardless of how those who engage in taxidermy view its position in the art world, a move to create beautiful naturalistic settings around specimens reveals a desire to motivate viewers to perceive art.
“People talk about the dioramas as art,” says Michaela Thompson, a doctoral candidate in the History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Thompson created an online archive for “Tangible Things” that explores the history of the Bengal tiger specimen in the HMNH. “[The dioramas] are supposed to represent the habitats of the animals and transport you,” she says. “It may be harder to look at the mounts themselves and say they are pieces of art too.” According to Thompson, the way in which a viewer perceives a specimen depends largely on its curation. In the HMNH, most of the older mounts are arranged in glass cases, and the rooms—usually dimly lit—are divided by continent. Recently, attempts have been made to cast the collections in a more textured setting: some of the walls behind the cases have been painted a bright, solid color, and embellishments such as woodchips have been scattered on the floor.
Indeed, museums have employed various methods in an attempt to aestheticize taxidermy. “The Language of Color,” which opened in the HMNH in 2008, is an exhibition that crosses taxonomic boundaries and features organisms that have evolved color for camouflage, mimicry, and sexual selection. According to Thompson, many specimens in the menagerie of beautifully colored creatures featured in this display have been carefully selected for both aesthetic and educational reasons. “It’s about spectacle. Museums want people to come and say, ‘oh that’s beautiful,’” she says. “I bet the people who come into this exhibit have a different reaction to these specimens than to some of the other animals.”
This desire for spectacle may be as important as the need for realism. When animals were commissioned for the MCZ, a teaching museum, they were intended for biology students first and the public second. But Thompson points to a specimen like the Bengal tiger that evokes drama as much as it exists as a teaching tool. Outstretched, with its teeth bared, the tiger seems to manifest its description on the label beneath it: “Many districts of India have been terrorized by this species which has acquired a taste for human flesh.” The labels likely date to the late 1800s or early 1900s, Thompson says. “These exhibits reflect an aesthetic sensibility but they also subtly reflect political, cultural, and social sensibilities of their time. In the case of the tiger, the cultural understanding of the tiger was that they are fierce, so they have their teeth bared. Other animals could do as much damage to you, but they look benign in their cases,” she says.
According to Hoekstra, however, seemingly aesthetic components of taxidermy may in fact serve a scientific function. Apart from making a specimen look lifelike, taxidermists responsible for public museum displays also seek to emphasize an aspect of the animal’s biology. Therefore, carnivores bare their teeth not so they seem menacing, but rather because teeth are a distinguishing feature of this group of mammals.
“POSSESSION AND PRIZE”
Compared to taxidermy displayed in museums, commercial taxidermy—in the case of hunters who want models of the animals they have killed—reflects an intimacy between a taxidermied object and its owner. “Part of how people present taxidermy has a lot to do with how they view their relationship with the animal,” says Justin A. Rice ’99. In 1998, Rice and the nine other students in Visual and Environmental Studies 50: “Fundamentals of Filmmaking” shot a film titled “Instructions for Collectors.” The film explores the work of commercial, scientific, and artistic taxidermists. “A hunter is really proud he killed the animal, while a scientist is trying to make sure a dead animal didn’t waste its life,” Rice says.
For Amy Stein, a New York-based photographer whose series “Domesticated” ran in the HMNH in 2010, hunting was the gateway to taxidermy. While completing a series on women and guns, Stein came into contact with animals that had been killed in hunts and followed them to the taxidermist. She would later borrow specimens from a local taxidermist to construct “Domesticated,” which is based on encounters between animals and the citizens of Matamoras, Pa., a town that borders a state forest. “The original intent of the taxidermist and the client, the hunter, is to create a trophy for the client’s home. It represents the hunt and the hunter’s success,” Stein says.
“We have dominion over animals whether we like it or not, dead or alive,” she continues. “Taxidermy in a sense is that kind of possession and prize. But trophyism and art—maybe it’s all the same thing. People who have taxidermied animals usually have more than one; it’s the evidence of their successes. It is art collecting in a sense.” Yet while art collectors are almost never involved in the creation of the pieces they purchase, hunters who commission taxidermied specimens usually control some aspects of the artistic process itself. According to Stein, one of the obstacles she faced in shooting “Domesticated” was having to borrow animals that hunters had commissioned in specific and often aggressive poses, rather than dictating how she wanted the specimens to be displayed.
While the century-old mounts in museums such as the HMNH have outlived those who were personally involved in their acquisition, a sense of achievement with regard to a collection exists for institutions as it does for individual hunters. “It’s all about possession for the museum too—[being able to say] ‘we have a complete collection,’” Thompson says.
CONTEXT OVER CONTENT
For those who know little about taxidermy, however, the significance of a given object may lie outside that object itself. While the artistic value of a taxidermied specimen depends on its ultimate function, the meaning a viewer derives from a piece is influenced by its surroundings.
For Carlin E. Wing ’02, engaging the HMNH in a novel way provided the impetus for last year’s Bizarre Animals, an event that featured contemporary artists using the museum as a medium to display their works. According to Wing, Bizarre Animals was an attempt to encourage audiences to view the existing space of the HMNH and its collections in a different way. “When taxidermy is put up in homes, it may be read as decoration or trophy,” says Wing. “In the case of a museum like the HMNH, I’m not sure that people approach it the way they would an art museum.”
“That was why it was interesting to bring contemporary artists into the museum,” she continues, “because the space could be activated with contemporary art works. In this case artists could make people re-see the museum. People might come with assumptions and leave and say, ‘actually, the way I was looking at the color and form of the specimens, is not that different from how I look at art.’”
Similarly, one aspect of the “Tangible Things” exhibition involves introducing 16 ‘guest objects’ from various Harvard collections into existing displays. According to Gaskell, these guest objects are meant to effectively defamiliarize the original pieces. In the HMNH, the instructors placed a glass vase in the shape of a flower amidst the famous Blaschka Glass Flowers. Louis Tiffany fashioned the vase in the late 19th century, around the same time glass artisans Leopold and Rudolph Blaschka created lifelike models of flowers for the purpose of teaching botany. “The vase is made of the same material [as the glass flowers], but it’s an ‘artwork,’ a highly stylized flower,” Gaskell says. “Why is the vase an artwork and the glass flowers not? It was a similar way of working with the same material, and there’s the flora aspect for both, but one is highly stylized and the others are extremely realistic.”
Ultimately, the myriad priorities of taxidermists and their creations complicate how the form itself may be seen as art. However, this very ambiguity illustrates the extent to which the mindset and surroundings of a viewer influence the effect of a given object. For taxidermy, the relationship between a specimen’s intrinsic artistic qualities and its advertised purpose determine how it is perceived on an individual basis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you work without pay at a for-profit company this summer, the federal government should fine your employer. At least that’s the position of many academics who have argued that unpaid internships unfairly advantage wealthier students who can afford to work for free. It was about this time a year ago that the Obama administration announced a crackdown on unpaid internships in the for-profit sector, sparking a debate at Harvard and other campuses about the scope for regulation of these on-the-job training experiences. While unpaid jobs might disproportionately benefit the upper class, enforcing restrictions on internships undermines labor market protections for those who most need them.
The New York Times reported last April that unpaid internships have proliferated over the past two decades, accompanied by violations of federal employment law. The U.S. Department of Labor has hired 250 more investigators to bring firms into compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, which establishes a minimum wage and stipulates circumstances under which compensation for work in the for-profit sector may deviate from the legal wage floor. The Labor Department has developed six guidelines based on the FLSA that must be fulfilled for such jobs to be uncompensated, including that the intern must not displace paid workers, and that the employer must derive no immediate benefit from the intern’s work. Any labor that directly benefits a for-profit company, in other words, must be compensated even if the employee is willing to work for free.
College students accept unpaid short-term positions in exchange for experience and contacts in their prospective professions, but some have objected that unpaid internships provide an unfair advantage to certain students. The Crimson staff noted last spring that socioeconomic class determines, in large part, one’s ability to procure an internship, since less well-to-do students may not be able to forgo wages during the summer. These underprivileged students may face “de facto discrimination when applying for jobs for which an internship is deemed a stepping-stone.”
No doubt wealthier students find it easier to get both paid and unpaid employment. But requiring that all internships be compensated would result in substantially fewer of them being offered due to the expense to companies in terms of wages and paperwork associated with hiring paid employees. Even if the government eliminates this small instance of unfairness at the price of fewer on-the-job training experiences, it cannot expect to eliminate the role of interpersonal relationships in hiring decisions that inevitably advantages the well-to-do. Upper-class students will continue to have connections that afford them greater access to paid internships, as well as real jobs after college.
In the end, however, the debate about equity of internship opportunities within the collegiate community is largely beside the point. The very fact that interns are in college indicates that they are far more privileged than the people the federal minimum wage is designed to protect. The Labor Department’s unpaid internship guidelines are derived from the 1947 Supreme Court ruling in Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., which involved the payment of participants in a seven to eight-day course on the duties of a railway yard brakeman. The minimum wage was established to maintain a basic standard of living for the poor by ensuring that the wages of blue-collar workers—the kind of people who stop freight trains for a living—do not fall below a certain level. It was not intended to protect future college graduates, who will make far more than $7.25 an hour regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds.
This is relevant in part because of how difficult it is to regulate the internship market. The Times notes that it is hard to mount a major enforcement effort because “interns are often afraid to file complaints,” worried they will endanger their chances with a potential employer. A ban on unpaid internships breeds disrespect for employment regulations in general, including those that benefit the poor, since its unenforceability demonstrates to firms that those who ignore the law benefit by employing free labor without consequences.
Even assuming the law could be perfectly enforced, the personnel and other resources used to monitor compliance must be diverted from other government functions. As Ivy League intellectuals wring their hands about equality of opportunity among America’s most privileged youth, many employer abuses of menial labor go unprosecuted. The most egregious manifestation of this is human trafficking, which is surprisingly prevalent in the United   States and has elicited a woefully inadequate response from the federal government. Given the extent of demands on the government’s finite resources, ensuring equity among elites should be a low priority.
A more legitimate objective is to prevent unpaid interns from displacing paid employees, but the sort of tasks performed by summer law clerks and medical research assistants, as well as the temporary nature of many positions, suggests that interns’ willingness to work for free will rarely impact minimum-wage earners. What is needed is not stricter enforcement of current regulations, but a reworking of the regulatory regime, and possibly the FLSA itself, so that government efforts are targeted at protecting lower-class workers who live paycheck-to-paycheck—not college students and middle-class employees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week’s New York district court ruling on Google’s information plans to digitize every book ever published is important news here in Cambridge. The judge in the case, Denny Chin, ruled against Google’s 2008 settlement with the Author’s Guild and Association of American Publishers as a “de facto” violation of anti-trust law. The settlement had paved the way for the digitalization of some 15 million books. In ruling as he did, Chin has established a serious roadblock in Google’s lofty aims. Of course, the matter will likely now proceed on a national level, as Chin has advised that Congress consider the issue of a monopoly on digital information. Despite all these setbacks, however, Google remains keen to expand the number of books it has made accessible on the Internet without cost.
Harvard, too, is eager to expand the body of digital information. True, the ruling is less important at the moment to the University, which severed its ties with Google’s project in October 2009. In the meantime, Harvard professors—generally opposed to a quasi-joint venture with the internet’s corporate behemoth—have advocated a project of their own, setting up an online library known as the Digital Public Library of America in conjunction with other universities.
In our view, regardless of the convictions shared by defenders of Google and the DPLA, what is important here is that the information in question be digitized and made publicly available as quickly as possible. Given that this week’s ruling places many obstacles in Google’s path, it is time for Harvard to throw even more weight behind the DPLA project.
With the world’s largest library after that of the Library of Congress, Harvard occupies a key position to deliver lasting benefits to the world of online content. As an institution whose role has traditionally been defined by teaching and producing high-quality information, Harvard should to work with the entity that stands the best chance to deliver these goals. In that sense, the community should thus come to view the question of the DPLA vs. Google not as an ideological issue but rather in practical terms. In short: Which solution is more likely to succeed in sharing the most amount of information possible in the shortest possible timeframe?
After the recent ruling, that solution seems to be the DPLA.
As Google’s digital expansion efforts are under tremendous legal scrutiny, not to mention the scores of publishers, it hardly seems as though a Google-generated digitalization of Harvard’s vast collection is even a remote possibility. Having already turned its back on the partnership with the company, Harvard should now take this ruling as further validation of its own independent digitalization plans. Besides, it is futile to deny that problems could not arise from a situation that could ultimately lead to a monopoly over scholarship. While Google certainly has the money and the equipment to scan information fast, it might not be the worst thing for Harvard to chart its own course in content digitalization with other non-profit institutions.
Additionally, the question of copyright ownership and, fundamentally, whether Google is depriving publishers and authors of a fair deal seems important to keep in mind throughout the larger debate. In the rush to take advantage of the capabilities afforded by the information age, it is far too easy to marginalize the interests of producers and content copyright holders. The Internet has left authors and publishing houses in far less control over how their property is distributed. Harvard must remember its own function as a major producer of such information and work to secure the best interests of those who at the end of the day own the rights to the content to be transferred online.
The accessibility of information is vital to education, to academia, and to the intellectual process in general. Harvard is right to strive toward making its own information widely accessible. Even though the DPLA project appears confined to infancy, we hope that the current legal issues Google faces do not deter the library’s administration but instead spur them on, and, in doing so, encourage universities and institutions everywhere to embark on initiatives of their own.
The digital age is here to stay, and content digitalization is here to grow. Harvard had better not miss out on education’s next race to the finishing line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, I was one of thousands of NYTimes.com readers who visited the site's homepage to learn that the publication would soon be introducing a pay model for its online content. As a devoted reader and fan of The Times, I must conclude that the step toward a pay model was regrettably inevitable, and indicative of not only a large change in the role The Times will play in the world, but also the continuing evolution of journalism in the digital age.
In the business section, The Times reports that the paid online subscription was “in the works for years,” which speaks to its inevitability. The recession of the past few years hit many industries hard, but few were hit as hard as online advertising. Even as the world slowly recovers from the downturn, the now-former system does not seem to be economically sustainable, so it is hard to blame The Times for wanting to make a profit-minded change. With the failure of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer fresh in executives’ memories, the cost of doing nothing is clearly too large.
However, it would be a mistake for us to accept this change as unavoidable without at examining the social cost. The Times' online pay model is the beginning of a divide in journalism. On one end, there will be the high-quality, in-depth, comprehensive journalism that The Times has provided for years, and on the other end will be a lower-quality alternative. As readers realize that they must pay for high-quality content, fewer will be willing to do so. As a result, there will be more consumers in the market for low-quality journalism, and so the two varieties will diverge further.
But it is clear that the New York Times Company did its best to mitigate this divide. It avoided the traditional pay wall model employed by other publications such as the Wall Street Journal. Furthermore, the flexibility of The Times model allows it to control the limit of free articles, so that in an emergency that limit might be lifted. Lastly, they embrace social media by allowing access to all content through social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. These aspects of the model demonstrate The Times' understanding of the potential risks of the pay model, and should be commended.
Despite these efforts, there will still be a limit on journalistic content, and the consequences of this limit and the resulting segmentation in journalism are potentially very serious. The average reader will likely be less informed. Perhaps worse, the poorer reader will likely be less informed. While there might be few differences between the news content on sites like NYTimes.com and other free alternatives, it is clear that these differences will grow as the divide between high and low quality journalism widens. This divide in journalism threatens to create worsen the information gap between the rich and the poor.
On this level, it is socially inefficient to think of the New York Times Company, or any other company that engages in journalism as “just a business.” Whether this move will make business sense remains to be seen (the company's earlier venture with paid online content, TimesSelect, was quickly discontinued after an internal study deemed it unprofitable). However, The Times as a national leader in journalism has a mandate to benefit the public, as a well functioning democracy demands a open press. Therefore, it might be helpful to think of journalism as a type of public good, roughly akin to national defense. It is ineffective when one tries to exclude people from it, and its value isn't diminished when more people consume it.
Considering journalism a public good suggests that it might not best be provided by a profit-seeking entity like a company. For instance, the BBC, a world leader in journalism is run by the British government. Wikipedia, one of the most influential online information providers, operates as a nonprofit. Neither of these are suitable solutions now for The Times, but the evolution of online journalism suggests that these may be the socially optimal solutions of the future.

From the grass in Harvard Yard to the Dunster/Mather dining hall to the bright green levers on all Harvard toilets, the mantra “Green is the New Crimson” certainly seems to apply to Harvard’s environmentally conscious mindset. But although Harvard ranks in the Princeton Review’s “Green Honor Roll” of environmentally friendly schools, one rather large obstacle stands in the way of knowing whether Harvard is as green as it appears. After all, this University’s biggest asset is its now 27 billion dollar endowment.
With such a large endowment, Harvard has the potential to put enormous pressure on unsustainable corporations to improve their environmental practices and support companies committed to sustainability. But due to the Harvard Management Corporation’s lack of transparency, donors to the University and students like me have absolutely no idea if Harvard is investing in environmentally friendly companies.
Harvard  College certainly boasts many green student organizations, from Green ‘14 to the Environmental Action Committee. Most of these groups focus on student education initiatives and changes in Harvard’s day-to-day operations. However, while they do important work, Harvard must adopt far-reaching sustainable investment policies in order to become truly “green.”
The only way to hold the University accountable for the sustainability of its investments is transparency. The Harvard Management Corporation, which controls Harvard’s endowment, must allow students and potential donors to investigate its investment portfolio.
The 2010 College Sustainability Report Card rates American universities on a grading scale from A to F in different aspects of environmental sustainability. Although Harvard earned mostly A’s in areas ranging from “Food & Recycling” to “Administration,” we received a measly C in the “Endowment Transparency” section.
The Report Card noted that Harvard does have an Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (ACSR) and a Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (CCSR). The ACSR listens to proposals from students and faculty about ethical investment choices for Harvard, and the CCSR votes whether to accept those proposals. However, although an overview of the decisions of Harvard’s Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility is available upon request, the University only reveals its list of endowment holdings to trustees and senior administrators. This does not allow students, faculty, or potential donors to assess the sustainability of Harvard’s investments for themselves.
Furthermore, the CCSR’s 2010 report reveals little beyond requests to companies like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to provide reports relating to environmental and human rights issues and plans for greenhouse gas reduction. While these steps are a good start, the CCSR could do much more to ensure the ethical nature of Harvard’s investments. Additionally, the Harvard Management Corporation provides no information about whether companies actually follow through on these proposals or how much money Harvard invests in these and similarly unsustainable corporations. If the CCSR took stronger stances on environmental issues or addressed more companies, it could actually ensure the responsibility of Harvard’s investments. And if its proceedings were more public, students and donors could hold the CCSR better accountable to its mission of sustainability.
Fortunately, the Higher Education Transparency Act , a bill introduced recently to the Massachusetts State Legislature, would require that Harvard and other private universities in the state make information about their investments available to the public. This increased transparency will allow more critical discussion about the ethics of Harvard’s investments and hopefully lead to a more socially just endowment. Students, faculty, and administrators alike should support and encourage increased transparency not only as a means to financial accountability, but as the only way for Harvard to become a true green University.
Transparency is important to enable an assessment of how “green” Harvard and its investments really are.  Indeed, if Harvard truly wishes to be green, it cannot invest in companies that follow business models incompatible with sustainable energy and green industry. Furthermore, the Harvard Management Corporation must be more transparent about its investments so that concerned students and student groups can evaluate the University’s portfolio and petition for more ethical investments.  Lastly, the CCSR must be more responsive to concerns about sustainability and take more drastic actions against environmentally destructive companies, such as reprimands and divestment.
So, what should environmentally conscious students do? Most importantly, we should speak out in support of the Higher Education Transparency Act: it’s possibly one of the most important environmental laws that will come out of the Massachusetts legislature this year. And in the meantime, we’ll just have to continue using our travel mugs and taking shorter showers—because without investment accountability, that’s about all we can do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The judge who will preside over the trial of Jabrai Jordan Copney—the alleged gunman in the 2009 Kirkland shooting—announced his intention yesterday to separate into a different trial the charges pertaining to Copney’s involvement in an earlier armed robbery, but to allow evidence of that incident in the Kirkland case.
At a hearing held in Essex Superior Court in Salem, Judge John T. Lu heard a wide range of motions from Copney’s defense attorney John A. Amabile and prosecutors Daniel J. Bennett ’85 and David M. Solet, Harvard Law School ’01.
Copney has been charged with crimes relating to the murder of Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway, as well as an alleged armed theft of marijuana from two Yale students.
According to prosecutors, Jason Aquino and Blayn Jiggetts—the two other men indicted for the murder—say that the robbery of the Yale men in 2008 was a model for the attempted “drug rip” which led to Cosby’s slaying.
Bennett and Solet motioned to join the two sets of charges in one trial. Amabile countered with a motion to sever the two crimes into different trials and a motion to forbid the earlier robbery from being mentioned at the Kirkland murder trial.
“It would be completely inappropriate to bring them up at the same trial,” Amabile said in court. “They’re not related offenses, and they do not arise out of the same transaction or event.”
Amabile argued that the jury would be unfairly biased against his client’s character if evidence of a previous wrongdoing were to be included.
“Allowing this would be grossly prejudicial and would be illegal,” he said.
Lu said he will likely agree with Amabile’s contention that the charges should be severed but will not accept his argument that all discussion of the earlier robbery should be suppressed in the Kirkland trial.
“It may well be that I will order the robbery case severed from the trial of the murder—and admit a carefully sanitized version of the robbery incident at the murder trial,” Lu announced.
In one of the many other motions proposed during yesterday’s hearing, Amabile asked that Jiggetts’ docket be unsealed.
The prosecutors and Lu agreed that Jiggetts’ case file, which had been kept secret until yesterday, should be unimpounded.
Bennett said during yesterday’s hearing that Jiggetts, who was charged with first-degree murder, has pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter but has not yet been sentenced. He will testify at Copney’s trial.
Aquino pleaded guilty, also to manslaughter, last Thursday.
In other motions—more than 10 were brought forth in rapid succession—each side moved to suppress certain evidence from being heard by the jury in the upcoming trial, which will begin Monday.
After argument from both sides, Lu allowed several motions on the spot and decided that the remainder merited further consideration.
Amabile also introduced a proposed questionnaire for potential jurors which he had drafted.
Prosecutors argued that the 15-page document—which includes inquiries about jurors’ favorite books and movies, frequency of religious observance, and attitudes towards their children’s activities—is unnecessarily intrusive.
“The number of questions on this and the detail of issues some of these questions go into is far beyond what we have a right to go into,” Bennett said.
Copney, who was present for the hearing, was attentive to the proceedings, turning the pages of the memoranda despite the handcuffs restricting his movements.

Students at Harvard and Stanford are working to explore the future of the internet as part of a six-week course.
The course—which connects two classrooms at Harvard and Stanford via video communication—is part of an effort between Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society and the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.
The class, called “Ideas for a Better Internet,” is comprised of approximately equal shares of law school students and undergraduates concentrating in computer science.
It is a part of a larger program that is currently being developed, which aims to address perceived problems with the internet, including user privacy issues and issues of government interference.
Harvard Law School Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain is coordinating the class at Harvard, and Yale University Computer Science Lecturer Elizabeth Stark is coordinating the course at Stanford.
“I think we’re trying to push the envelope with East Coast, West Coast collaboration—using technology to collaborate, especially [considering] the class embraces technology,” Stark said.
The course is the product of a partnership between the two centers, which Zittrain helped foster after he worked as a visiting professor at Stanford Law, according to Stark. As part of the partnership, Harvard students have flown to Stanford for the last two winter breaks to collaborate with Stanford students in a short course, which required them to deliberate on problems with the internet and propose solutions.
Stark said that the winter course asked a lot of students in a short period of time, hence the incentive to extend the program to an entire year.
“The [spring] course is part of what may become a regular year-long process to identify and refine ideas for a better Internet,” Zittrain said.
Instead of asking students to fix problems they see with the internet, the spring course will require students to solicit ideas from users on the internet for ideas.
Stark said that she thought the ideas that students have brainstormed will probably be similar to ideas that will be submitted on the internet. She said that, according to their applications, the students are especially interested in improving internet access and privacy. In light of governments in Libya and Egypt shutting down the internet in attempts to stem public uprisings, Stark said that students were interested in researching the possibility of creating sources for network access that could not be shut down by oppressive governments.
Students are also interested in protecting internet users’ private information and giving users more information about how their information is distributed, she said.
Stark called the spring course a “work in progress,” and added that once her and Zittrain have further developed the program, she would like to inspire other universities to develop similar programs.
“I’d love to see more academic programs involve students working on real problems,” Stark said.

Last night the Cambridge City Council took a break from its normal order of business to hold a roundtable with the Elections Commission to discuss councilors’ concerns with the voting process.
Election Commissioner Polyxane S. Cobb answered hypothetical questions councilors posed regarding the designation of a voter as inactive and the process for requesting an absentee ballot.
“Don’t tell him too much,” said Mayor David P. Maher, winking at the Election Commission after Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves’ 72 asked the commissioners to explain the process for accessing information about the number of absentee ballots requested.
The Election Commission is also responsible for redrawing the precinct lines within the city of Cambridge. Commissioners indicated that Cambridge has seen an increase of 3,800 voters since the precincts were last examined­­, which is correlated with a spur of residential development.
Regulations require that the Commission is not  break up minority enclaves in their reconfiguration of wards and precincts. Cobb also indicated that the Commission will be seeking public comment and input from the council.
Commissioner Peter Sheinfeld, responding to a question posed by Councilor Leland Cheung, indicated that the council should not expect too many modifications. One major limitation, Sheinfeld said, is finding polling locations that are handicapped accessible.
“Voting has to be convenient as well, and that was a loss for a number of people in this community,” said Councilor Marjorie C. Decker, expressing dismay regarding the loss of voting precincts ten years ago. She called on the Election Commission to maintain or increase the number of precincts currently in the Cambridge. She also expressed concerns about the State’s plan to change legislative districts and the impact on the number of representatives native to Cambridge. Cambridge currently has six state legislators representing the district, with only two residing within its borders, Decker said.
Reeves suggested to the Election Commission look at the “evolving sociology of the city” and reconsider placing polling places in areas that have higher densities of eligible voters, noting that some new developments that were designed to house foreign students who are ineligible to vote. Commissioners stated that state laws require precincts to be determined by population, rather than actual registered voters.
The roundtable concluded with a discussion about possibilities of improving election result reporting. Maher leaned over his table and looked at the members of the press in the audience, joking  about the existence of willing co-sponsors for such a program. Councilors disagreed however as to whether or not reporting should simply be of results or also include commentary.
Local bloggers and reporters weren’t all enthusiastic about the conversation, with one individual being heard saying the discussion was “so stupid it’s insulting,” that the Council was trying to decide the terms of the media coverage of their own election.
No votes were taken at last night’s meeting.

Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas joined students, parents, and other Massachusetts professors yesterday evening at a public hearing at F.A. Day Middle School, urging the Newton Public School Committee to reconsider the implementation of a proposed budget that would eliminate Latin courses at the middle school level.
Besides Latin, the school committee is also considering cuts in the arts, foreign languages, and special education programs.
“What is important here is that it is the middle school Latin experience that sets up the value of Latin and however much or little the student will pursue in the following years,” Thomas said.
Addressing the superintendent, committee members, and concerned parents, Thomas said that, as the father of two children, he and his family moved to Newton because of the exceptional public school system in 1987.
“It should be a source of pride that some 300 of our seventh and eighth grade students are allowed to take Latin,” he said. “We should see this as one of the real jewels of our educational system and preserving this experience should be, in my opinion, a priority.”
The School Committee voted initially last Thursday in a straw poll to support the proposed $171.6 million budget, which requires more than 30 positions to be cut. The public hearing was aimed to gauge the reaction of residents prior to a formal vote, which will take place within the next month.
School Committee Chairperson Claire Sokoloff told the audience that these cuts were difficult, but were the best options to address anticipated budget increases in the next fiscal year.
“There was a $4.4 million gap that the superintendent did manage to close, but not without program cuts and other losses,” she said. “We have been able to preserve a lot in our schools given the magnitude of the cuts that we have had to make.”
Audience members volunteered in advance to address the committee members and superintendent, advocating against the elimination of middle school Latin courses. A Newton North High School student stood and read a letter from her friend in college, who could not attend the meeting in person.
“The greatest benefit that I received from taking Latin was that it gave me something to be passionate about,” she read. “It made me feel like I was special. There aren’t many ways that you can stand out in middle school, but here I was a crusader and a protector of a higher level of learning.”
Sherley Blood Thom, a Latin teacher at Newton North High School, told the committee and superintendent that although many people were surprised that Latin was still taught in schools, the benefits from the courses were indisputable.
“Middle school enrollments are critical to the survival of Latin departments in high schools,” she said. “Do you want to be the ones who break the link between these children and an ancient legacy that has done so much good?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nigerian Ambassador Adebowale I. Adefuye said that Nigeria is the key to establishing peace and stability in Africa during a talk at the Barker Center yesterday.
The ambassador discussed American intervention in Libya, Nigerian-American relations, and upcoming Nigerian elections slated to begin April 2.
“We [the government of Nigeria] don’t take no nonsense,” he told the audience during the latest event in the “Nigeria in the World Seminar Series” sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
The Ambassador had strong words for the U.S. on the subject of the conflict in Libya.
While he appreciated international support of the region, he was adamant that the U.S. should not overstep its boundaries.
“We don’t want a post-Saddam [Hussein] situation with Iraq in Libya,” Adefuye said, later adding, “We don’t want to see America dropping bombs on Africa.”
Adefuye stressed the mutual economic and social interests of the U.S. and Nigeria, arguing that the country must serve as an agent for peace in the region.
“We are committed to a nuclear proliferation-free, democratic, terrorism-free world,” he said. “For there to be peace and security in the world, there has to be peace and security in Africa, and if there is to be peace and security in Africa, it has to start in Nigeria.”
Students said the event helped them understand Nigeria’s role in African politics and beyond.
“It was great to hear about how change is coming to Nigeria from within,” Oluwatobi “Tobi” T. Tikolo ’14 said.
Kennedy M. Opala ’12 said the talk informed his view of Nigeria.
“It’s cool that Nigeria is ready to be an integral member of the world community,” he said.
Adefuye, who said he is not a politician, wanted students to understand that the relationship between the U.S. and Nigeria is better than many people realize.
“We have many goals in common,” he said. “We succumb to the same ideals.”

Applied Mathematics 50, a survey course with more than 100 students, may undergo restructuring next fall as faculty members reconsider its future within the concentration curriculum.
Professors said that course size may be limited to 40 to restore the faculty-student engagement initially incorporated into the course design.
The course was conceived five years ago as a discussion-based class with 20 to 30 students. Created by applied mathematics professor Michael P. Brenner, it sought to introduce potential applied math concentrators and enthusiasts to the many diverse applications of mathematical modeling.
Enrollment has since exploded. According to Margo S. Levine, assistant director for undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics and a co-teacher of the course, there are just over 100 students currently enrolled—20 more than were expected from pre-enrollment figures.
The course’s initial small size allowed faculty to evaluate students without assigning homework or administering exams, said Levine—a model that is no longer plausible with so many students.
“We’re thrilled that it’s so large; obviously it’s serving a need,” said Marie Dahleh, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences assistant dean for academic programs.
“We really just want to make sure that people are in there for the right reasons,” she said.
In addition to possible size limits, the department is considering restricting the course to primarily freshmen and sophomores, with a few spots available to upperclassmen by application.
Levine said she thinks the jump in numbers could be attributed to the popularity of both Dahleh and Brenner, who have taught the course in the past.
But Dahleh also said she thinks the purpose of the course has changed—and not necessarily in the right direction.
“It evolved into satisfying a ... requirement,” she said.
The course has a traditionally light workload, according to Anna M. Wagner ’11, who took it two years ago and was a teaching fellow in the class as a junior, when enrollment almost tripled.
Professors have added a laboratory component and homework assignments to supplement student presentations already structured into the course.
“I honestly don’t think it would hurt to make it a much more rigorous course,” said Wagner, who cited Computer Science 50—a demanding introductory course still taken by many students—as an appropriate model. “Make it much more intense and that way cut down on some of the students who are just taking it for an easy A.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have recently discovered a novel method for fire suppression using electrical fields—a finding that may have implications for firefighting because it does not rely on the rapid delivery of physical suppressants such as water, powder, or carbon dioxide to the site of a flame.
The scientists discovered that by applying an oscillating electrical field, they could trigger stronger interactions between the electrical field and the charged flame particles. The effects were strong enough to put the flame out, according to Ludovico Cademartiri, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of chemistry and chemical biology who worked on the study.
The scientists took a piece of metallic electrode in the shape of thin metal wire and connected it to a high voltage power supply and positioned that wire in the proximity of a controlled methane gas flame. Then, they turned on the high voltage source which sinusoidally raised and lowered the voltage.
“Think of it as blowing out a flame,” said Kyle J. M. Bishop, a former postdoctoral fellow at the George M. Whitesides Research Group who continues to collaborate with Cademartiri and the Harvard team. “The [electrical field] pulls to separate the region that’s hot and burning from the unburnt fuel, so that fuel will not continue to burn.”
In their experiments, the scientists used time-varying electrical fields to extinguish small flames—the kind of electromagnetic radiation that could act at a distance. Their success so far suggests that their novel method may enable firefighters to combat a flame from afar in the future. It also increases speed of address, since it takes electrical fields a matter of milliseconds to put out a fire, said Bishop.
“We like to think that what we have here is essentially a new way to affect fires,” Cademartiri said. “Our hope and belief is that if we can find novel ways to address fires that are more sophisticated than just throwing water at it.”
“It’s certainly a new phenomenon,” said Applied Mathematics Professor Michael P. Brenner, adding that his colleagues’ findings were promising.
At the moment, however, the researchers still need to iron out some kinks and begin to work with electrical engineers and combustion scientists to design an effective firefighting device using electrical fields.
The team faces further challenges when converting its experimental ideas into practical tools. Although the electrical field itself is not dangerous to humans—the magnitude of the field the experimenters used is similar to the experience of a spark when touching the handle of a car—high voltages do carry the danger of making electrical discharges, which could potentially be hazardous.
The Whitesides Lab is also working on an a project that involves the use of sound, or acoustic waves, for flame suppression.
“They’re taking giant speakers and aiming them at flames,” Bishop said. “It’s a testament to [Professor] Whitesides for coming up with these crazy ideas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s decision to bring back early action has received mixed reviews from admissions experts.
Some observers questioned what changes occurred in the last five years to cause the University to reverse its position on early action, which it once argued hurt underrepresented groups in the admissions process.
Harvard announced on Feb. 24 that non-binding early admission will return for the class of 2016. The College decided to eliminate the program five years ago in a move that administrators hailed as a progressive step to increased access to highly selective institutions for underrepresented groups.
At the time, proponents of the program’s elimination argued that more affluent students had better access to the resources needed to apply early.
“Early admission programs tend to advantage the advantaged,” then president Derek C. Bok said at the time. “Students from more sophisticated backgrounds and affluent high schools often apply early to increase their chances of admission, while minority students and students from rural areas, other countries, and high schools with fewer resources miss out.”
Bok declined to comment for this article.
According to University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the circumstances have changed dramatically in the past four years.
“As we have transformed the pool and the class in recent years we have found that large numbers of our less advantaged students were also seeking the certainty of an early possibility,” Faust said in an interview last month. “One of the circumstances that has changed is the financial crisis... It’s made individuals want to understand fully and definitely what their choices are.”
Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who has been a critic of early admissions, said that Harvard’s arguments against early admission from five years ago are equally true today.
“Harvard did the right thing several years ago by trying to make the system more equitable and eliminating early action,” he said. “I’m not sure why that would change dramatically over the last few years.”
Kahlenberg said that he is yet to see any data to support the University’s claims.
Sandy Baum—a professor emeritus at Skidmore College who works as an analyst for the College Board—said that while she supports efforts to make admissions to highly selective institutions more open, she is less concerned about the return of early admission.
“It is certainly true that low income students are less like to apply early action or early decision than others,” said Baum. “That said, I don’t really believe early is the problem.”
Baum believes that the admissions process at highly selective institutions would benefit from a complete overhaul to make it less competitive.
The University said that in recent years its financial aid initiatives have encouraged low income applicants to consider Harvard, and argued that it did not believe re-introducing early action would diminish those efforts.
“There’s been a lot of effort to get the word out that there is financial aid and there’s been a lot of effort to get lower income students to think about elite colleges,” Baum said. “The test will be whether the representation of low income students will be higher than before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As rebel forces continue to battle the army of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi, some Harvard professors remained undecided about the United States’ involvement in the Libyan conflict.
Professors from the History and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations departments recognized the nuanced diplomatic situation the administration faces hours before President Obama defended U.S. military intervention to the nation.
“There are compelling reasons why we did what we did ... there are probably equally compelling reasons why we should not have gone in,” Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Professor William E. Granara said. “Only time will tell.”
Last month Libya broke out in full-scale revolt against the four-decade long rule of Gaddafi, following the successful pro-democracy protests in Tunisia and Egypt, Libya’s neighbors to the east and west.
After violence between insurgents and Gaddafi’s forces escalated, the United Nations passed a resolution to establish a “no-fly zone” over the country, and on March 19 military action began, led by the U.S., France, and Britain.
“The use of military of force is a last resort,” history Professor Erez Manela said, adding, however, that U.S. involvement has “prevented a bloodbath” in the region.
“On the one hand, the U.S. is already engaged in two Muslim countries. To be engaged long-term in a third country could potentially be a problem,” said Granara.
Perhaps Western European countries, who have greater economic stakes in the country, should have led the military effort, Granara said.
Critics have also questioned the use of U.S. military force in Libya but not in Bahrain and Yemen, Arab countries also undergoing pro-democracy revolts.
“I think you have to take each case on its own merits ... you look hypocritical, but in terms of national interests I think I agree with the State Department,” said Professor E. Roger Owen, who specializes in Middle Eastern history.
“It is a valid question to ask why we aren’t doing in Bahrain and Yemen what we are doing in Libya,” Granara said.
However, crafting appropriate foreign policy involves consideration of subtle differences in historical and economic context.
Yet ultimately, the professors all acknowledged that foreign policy involves an element of the unforeseeable.
“We have other examples from history where the U.S. remained on the sidelines and ... found itself regretting its lack of involvement,” said Manela, who studies international history and has academic interests in the Middle East.
“If Gaddafi leaves and Libya evolves into something more like a democracy, Obama and the French and the British will come out looking like heroes,” said Granara. “If Gaddafi doesn’t leave, Obama could go down in history as a one-term president.”

Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim-American member of Congress, challenged his audience to take an active role in combating anti-Muslim discrimination by speaking out in favor of the American dream of “liberty and justice for all” during a speech at Harvard Law School yesterday.
“We are in a moment of crisis in democracy in America,” said Ellison in a speech co-sponsored by the Harvard Islamic Society and the Harvard Muslim Law Students’ Association. “What I’m asking you to do is use everything in your power to talk about justice, to talk about inclusion, to talk about who’s included in this country, and to stand up against those people who are saying [Muslims] are not among us and [Muslims] are not welcome.”
Ellison’s speech comes on the heels of recent controversial Congressional hearings led by Republican Congressman Peter T. King of New York on alleged radicalization in the American Muslim community and the Muslim community’s response to extremism. Ellison said he opposes the hearings because they unfairly target one group.
In his talk, Ellison recounted a story he had told during these hearings about Mohammed Salman Hamdani, a young Muslim-American who was a first responder and died during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. When Hamdani was first reported missing, he was declared a “person of interest,” insinuating that he may have been involved in the attacks in some way.
“Here’s a guy who gave everything anybody could ever give, his life, to try to help his country be safe and yet he and his mother have to fight to be included in phrases like ‘we the people’ or ‘liberty and justice for all,’” Ellison said.
He categorized the hearings as an instance of “demagoguery” where political leaders manipulate fear for their own end of gaining political support.
“The impulse in American politics and in society is to whip up us versus them sentiment to win people to your side,” Ellison said. “[King] is trying to make Americans fearful so they will look to him and for that you need a scapegoat.”
Ultimately, Ellison was optimistic about the future of America as he compared the current struggle of Muslim-Americans to groups in the past who overcome discrimination whether that be Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor or women who were denied the right to vote.
Event attendees said that Ellison provides an important example, especially to the Muslim-American population, of how an individual can engage in government in order to fight for what they believe in.
“His vision of including Muslim-Americans into the dialogue of American and the discourse of America is just incredibly inspiring and gives us a voice within the system,” said Farhan Murshed ’11, a member of the Harvard Islamic Society and one of the event’s organizers. “He’s the anti-hate.”

Despite expressing some concerns with United States policy in Libya, former Democratic Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson affirmed his support for the intervention at a “Pizza and Politics” event last night in Kirkland House.
Richardson—a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics—also expressed his overall support for the Obama presidency.
“I think the president is going in the right direction,” Richardson said. “The intervention of our airstrikes with NATO prevented a humanitarian disaster.”
But Richardson said he was concerned about potential instability that could result from removing Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi from power.
“Nonetheless, I worry about the endgame,” he said. “Where are we going to be if Gaddafi leaves?”
Richardson added that he thought there have been differing voices on what the United States should do in Libya.
“I think the policy was not clear, but I do believe it’s the right policy,” he said.
Richardson—who is of Mexican-American descent—also criticized the way both parties interact with Hispanic voters.
“Democrats sometimes ignore Hispanics, and Republicans are preaching too much hardline solution, especially on immigration.”
Richardson said he was concerned that one of three rising Republican Hispanic leaders—Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Gov. Brian E. Sandoval of Nevada, or Sen. Marco A. Rubio of Florida—could make the 2012 Republican ticket more appealing to Hispanic voters.
He contrasted these prominent Hispanic Republican figures with what he said was an absence of Hispanic leaders in the Democratic party.
“We don’t have that real entity that can make a difference for the Hispanic voter,” he said.
Richardson said that in order to defeat a Republican challenger—who he predicted would “probably” be Mitt Romney—the Democratic party must energize its base constituency.
“I think it’s important that we not neglect our base—environmentalists, unions, women’s groups, progressives, and gays and lesbians—at the expense of special interest groups,” he said.
Richardson said that despite these challenges, he believes that Obama will be reelected in 2012.
“On the whole, I believe [Obama]’s done a very good job as president,” he said.
“But I think it’s important that we try to push the party and our administration in the right direction,” he said, emphasizing his desire to see more aggressive immigration reform and an energy bill from the Obama administration.
Audience member Zachary W. Sherwood ’13 said he thought Richardson’s speech struck a balance between critical analysis and support of the administration.
“He does disagree with the Obama administration on some issues, but he’s still a huge supporter,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With March Madness just about as mad as it’s ever been, there’s no doubt many of Harvard’s basketball fans will be watching to see which unexpected member of the Final Four will cut down the nets in Houston next week.
But members of Harvard’s men’s club basketball team will be travelling down to the Lone Star State this weekend for a different reason.
The eight-member team will have its own the chance to cut down the nets at the National Campus Championship Series Basketball Championships on April 1-3, at the University of Texas in Austin.
The club team’s path to the NCCS National Championships was also rather unexpected as well. When a team dropped out of the NCCS Regional Tournament at Boston University at the last minute last month, the Harvard squad got a spot in the 24-team competition.
Harvard dominated its opponents, including last year’s regional champion Villanova, and ended up winning the tournament in a 50-36 blowout over Penn State, earning a spot at the National Championships.
As for the competition it will face in Texas this weekend, Harvard’s not quite sure what it will be up against—but then again, it might not really matter.
“We’re just excited about going to a warm place and finally being able to wear shorts again,” said freshman team member and Crimson contributing writer, Darren McLeod.

Already off to a strong season, Radcliffe rugby padded its season performance, winning in the Four Leaf 15 Tournament last weekend outside New York City. The team faced brutal winds and 40 degree weather in the single-day tournament, and players had no time to warm themselves up in between matches in the tightly-packed schedule.
"It was a physical and mental battle to stay focused despite the cold," senior Madeleine Ballard said.
But despite the adversity, Radcliffe managed to dominate Fordham and Northeastern in pool play, beating them 45-5 and 35-5, respectively, to catapult itself to the semifinals. Radcliffe then faced Yale, a team had beaten Radcliffe in the past three meetings between, including a loss in the spring of 2009 that dropped Radcliffe from Division I to Division II.
The Bulldogs scored first, but were unable to pull away. With help from the strong kicking of junior Maria Centeio, Radcliffe finished on top, 14-10, to move to the championship game.
A red-hot Radcliffe stepped into the finals match against Marist. Freshman Alexandra Brown scored first, and the team never relinquished its lead, ultimately cruising to the 50-10 win to take the tournament.
Radcliffe has also already qualified for Nationals, which take place on Apr. 16-17.
"This [tournament win] sets a strong base for us as we continue to train in anticipation of [Nationals]," Ballard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two-meter player and junior co-captain Devan Kennifer returned to her home state, California, for a competitive spring break. While there, Harvard women’s water polo (12-8, CWPA 1-0) went, 2-5, in tight matches against top-ranked teams, but ended its trip with four consecutive losses.
Back in Cambridge, the squad was determined to turn the California losses into lessons and use what it learned to defend Blodgett Pool on Sunday night.
No one was more determined than Kennifer, who helped the team snap its streak with five goals and five steals in a 12-8 victory over Wagner.
“Our record sounds pretty abysmal in California, but I think we played really well there,” Kennifer said. “Even though we had a four-game losing streak, we were playing such high quality teams and playing against them so well I think it was relieving, for one thing, to know that we brought that [quality] back from California.”
In the Crimson’s only game of the week, Kennifer dominated the water with plenty of help from her teammates. Harvard’s offensive formation cleared out the middle to leave Kennifer with plenty of open water to work with, and provided the junior the ample opportunity to get the ball in the back of the net. One such opening came off a textbook assist from junior Shannon Purcell, who set Kennifer up for one of her five goals on the evening
“It was really interesting because it was like déjà vu from practice the day before,” Kennifer said. “She was in the exact same position, and I was in the exact same position, and she gave me this really great pass that she had given me the day before. It directly translated from playing well in practice. She knew where I wanted the ball, when I wanted the ball, and that kind of thing, so it was kind of cool to see that in the game too.”
But, before arriving at a Crimson victory, the team faced setbacks, as controversial calls and momentum shifts threatened to destabilize the Harvard lead. Yet, Kennifer, who was the CWPA Northern Division Rookie of the Year her freshman year, gracefully dealt with these obstacles and managed to pull out a stellar performance.
“She’s our main offensive player, she’s our two-meter player, so our offense does revolve around her position,“ junior Monica Zdrojewski said. “And yesterday she just did an incredible job of adjusting. We probably weren’t getting calls that we should have been getting from the referees, for example, but she was able to score a lot of goals and finish her opportunities despite that fact.”
Kennifer proves to be a consistent goal-scorer, usually finding the back of the net at least once each game. But she leads the team in goals, with 50, for good reason—Kennifer is no stranger to high scoring.
Sunday’s spectacular showing paralleled Kennifer’s success at the Marist Tournament in Poughkeepsie, New York where she scored four goals against Siena and five against Marist the next day, securing two victories for Harvard. Similarly, Kennifer racked up five goals to defeat Brown and Iona in February.
Kennifer has undoubtedly been a force to be reckoned with throughout the season. She averages 2.5 goals per game and 2.8 steals per game. Her accomplishment Sunday further revealed her well-rounded skill set. She has had several performances with high goal scoring and others with an impressive number of steals, but Kennifer outdid herself when she put the powerful pieces together this weekend.
Last year, Kennifer earned spots on the All-Northern Division first team and Eastern Championship All-Tournament second team, led the Harvard team with 67 goals on the season, and was Harvard’s Most Valuable Player Award recipient.
This year as a captain, Kennifer appears to be on track to lead the Crimson to more success through her individual accomplishments.
“As our captain, she’s a great leader both in the pool and out, and I think that’s been a huge force for us this season,” Zdrojewski said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding on tonight’s men’s lacrosse showdown is more than just a win.
The Crimson (5-2, 1-1 Ivy) faces off against No. 14 (USILA Coaches Poll) University of Massachusetts (5-2, 2-3 CAA) in a night game between two early-season powerhouses.
“I think this game is always for bragging rights for best team in the state,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik said.
With the Minutemen’s national ranking, tonight’s game takes on meaning beyond the standings. The Crimson is looking to regain its own national ranking, and a win against UMass could push the team back into the top 25.
Despite strong starts for both teams in the early going, Harvard and the Minutemen are coming off of disappointing losses, and both need the game to bounce back quickly before the full swing of conference play.
The Crimson lost its second game of Ivy League play against Dartmouth on Saturday, 9-8. After a back-and-forth game that featured four lead changes, the Big Green broke the tie with one second remaining on the clock to beat Harvard.
The loss ended the Crimson’s four-game win streak and dropped the team to 1-1 in league play.
“One thing our coach always tells us is that every game is an opportunity to play the best we can and play better than we did the last game,” sophomore defenseman Jason Gonos said.
After Harvard’s only other loss of the season, it came back in its following game to best then-No. 20 Georgetown. The Crimson once again looks to take down the ranked opponent to generate momentum into the second half of its season.
UMass lost a nail-biter of its own on March 19, falling to Penn State, 8-7.
Instead of losing on a last second shot, however, the Minutemen missed their own opportunity to score in the final seconds. Down by one and with time running out, Ryan Hantverk ripped a shot at the Nittany Lions’ net. But the ball ricocheted off the crossbar, ending UMass’ chance at the game.
“I think I can tell you [until] I’m blue in the face,” said Minute Men coach Greg Cannella in a post-game interview to umassathletics.com. “You have to score in the double digits if you’re gonna win college lacrosse games.”
In all four of the combined losses between Harvard and UMass, the losing team finished with a single-digit goal total.
But unlike the Crimson, the Minutemen have had a long time to recover with a 10-day hiatus since the loss against Penn State.
Harvard sees its own quick turnaround—its last game was on Saturday—as a distinct advantage tonight.
“Losing Saturday definitely left a bad taste in our mouths,” Gonos said. “It’s nice having a quick turnaround and [to have] the opportunity to play a good team to try to prove ourselves right away.”
After shooting only 8-of-41 against Dartmouth, the Crimson hopes to capitalize on its opportunities and finish its chances. Co-captain Dean Gibbons leads the Harvard squad with 26 points, 15 goals and 11 assists, and junior Jeff Cohen follows with 20 points, 18 goals, and two assists.
Both the Crimson and UMass are prolific with the stick, averaging more than 40 shots per game. This will be the 42nd time the two teams have played each other. The Minutemen lead the all-time record of 29-12, but Harvard has won two out of the last three games, including a 14-13 victory last season.
“We need all of our players to give their best efforts and to play their best team lacrosse in order for us to be successful tomorrow night,” Wojcik said. “Our game plan is just getting back to playing Harvard lacrosse.”

In a weekend packed with five trophies, four competitions, three divisions, and two different states, the Crimson took to the water with only one goal in mind: smooth sailing.
Coming off two ninth-place finishes last week, the Harvard sailing team put in strong performances in its recent slate of competitions, recording a first-place finish to claim its second win of the season and climbing to the top of the Ivy League once all was said and done.
71ST OWEN & MOSBACHER-KNAPP TROPHIES
Competing at Kings Point, N.Y., against the likes of Ancient Eight rivals Yale and Princeton, the Crimson turned in outstanding performances when the pressure was highest.
Senior skipper Alan Palmer and his crew, sophomore Alan Byrne and senior Meghan Wareham, set Harvard up for victory, finishing first in two of its 16 races and top three in seven to win the A-division.
Not to be outdone, the B-division squad, skippered by senior Teddy Himler alongside crew Wareham and freshman Sarah Pierson, also dominated its competition, recording 12 top-three finishes, including two wins, to take first-place, edging the rival Bulldogs by three points.
Together, the Crimson teams ended the day at 118 points—66 from Palmer’s crew and 52 from Himler’s—winning the whole regatta by 23 points over Yale’s141, and clinching the top spot in the Ivy League.
“I think it’s definitely going to be a good boost for morale,” sophomore Alma Lafler said. “We’ve been getting some pretty good results back and this validates what we feel. We’re a strong team this season.”
82ND BOSTON DINGHY CLUB CUP
Back on home waters, Harvard hosted the 82nd Boston Dinghy Cup on a cold and windy weekend on the Charles River.
But the home-course advantage proved to matter little, as the neighboring Terriers from Boston University got off to a great start in the A-division race, recording a low 78 points, and leaving the 13th-placed Crimson in their wake.
Still, the Harvard sailors managed to fight back with a first-place finish in the B-division. Lafler and junior Brendan Kopp won six of their 18 races on the weekend, putting up a strong showing, which ended in an 84-point finish for the Crimson.
“I think we just had a lot of good communication in our boat,” Lafler said. “The conditions were tough, and the wind made it pretty easy to capsize, but we kept talking to one another and adjusting the rate shifts.”
But in the C-division races, things just didn’t seem to go Harvard’s way. Only cracking the top three once in 18 races, sophomore Jason Michas and junior William White, a Crimson news editor, finished 14th with a score of 179, dropping the team’s overall rank to seventh-place on the day.
B.U. BRIDGE INVITATIONAL
Not too far away, the Crimson also participated in the Boston University Bridge Invitational, bracing wind up to 21 knots on familiar territory.
In the A-division, sophomore pair Nick Waldo and Jinyan Zang failed to finish any higher than fourth in their 14 races, tallying 123 points and ninth place out of 15 teams.
For the freshman combo of Ames Lyman and Alice Kenney, the B-races yielded more of the same.
Despite finishing consistently in the top half of the standings, Lyman and Kenney never broke into the top three spots, closing the day in sixth place with 100 points.
Overall, Harvard finished eighth on the day.
32ND WOMEN’S DUPLIN TROPHY
In its last competition of the weekend, the women’s team trekked over to Tufts’ Duplin Trophy regatta, in a contest that pitted the Crimson against opponents from across the East Coast. Harvard went 10-11 on the day in the team-racing event, good enough for a fourth place finish out of seven in the regatta.
“We were really just trying to get everyone up to speed this weekend,” junior Alex Jumper said. “We’ve got a pretty wide range of skill levels in team-racing, and this gave us a chance to give it some more practice in a more structured environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team missed its chance to be a part of March Madness.
But the team also missed out on the chance to call a 2011 Final Four coach among its alumni. According to Slate.com, Shaka Smart, the coach of Virginia Commonwealth University, turned down Harvard to play basketball at Kenyon College in Ohio.
Smart’s 11th-seeded VCU team—the clear Cinderella of the 2011 tournament—will square off against Butler on Saturday night in the national semifinals.
Based on his collegiate performance, Harvard could have used Smart during his years as a player. Smart attended Kenyon between 1995 and 1999 and was named to the All-USA Academic Team as a senior.
Crimson basketball had some of its better years in the late ’90s, but the historically unsuccessful program never seriously made a bid at the Ancient Eight title. Harvard only managed to finish above .500 once in league play—the team finished tied for second at 10-4 in the Ivies in 1997, but never posed a threat to a Princeton team that didn’t lose a league game.
Sydney Johnson, Princeton’s current head coach, was a senior during the Tigers’ undefeated campaign. His current Princeton squad lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to another of this year’s Final Four teams, fourth-seed Kentucky.
In the other three years during Smart’s collegiate career, Harvard finished 7-7, 6-8, and 7-7 in league play during the 1996, 1998, and 1999 seasons, respectively.
So Smart may not have been able to lead the Crimson to an Ivy title a decade ago. But we can pretend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring, at long last, has arrived. Yes, the ground looks like the head of a man in desperate need of some Rogaine, but it’s a start. Likewise, in the world of Ivy League sports, we’ve finally closed the book on the winter season, as Yale unexpectedly fell in the second round of men’s hockey’s version of the Big Dance, and spring sports are now in full gear. We’ll explain it all in another edition of Around the Water Cooler.
After one of the greatest seasons in school history, the Yale men’s hockey team couldn’t find a way to keep up with the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) on Saturday night. The top seed coming into the NCAA Men’s Ice Hockey Championship, the Bulldogs narrowly escaped Air Force on Friday, winning 2-1 in overtime.
But the following night, Yale didn’t get quite as lucky.
An unseeded UMD team easily defeated the Bulldogs, 5-3. After UMD opened up a commanding 5-1 lead by the end of the second period, Yale halved the goal differential in the final frame on two power-play goals, but that’s as close as the Bulldogs would come.
With the loss, Yale will have to wait another year to try to claim the school’s first-ever men’s hockey national championship. Only two Ancient Eight schools—Harvard and Cornell—have ever accomplished the feat.
And with that, winter sports in the Ivy League came to a close.
But while the spring is still young, we already have a pretty good idea of who’ll be the movers and shakers this season.
It’s hard to dominate much more than Harvard junior pitcher Rachel Brown has. In the first three weeks of the season, she earned the Ivy League Player of the Week accolade twice. And she doesn’t seem to be slowing down much.  Her last two starts before this afternoon have been dominant: she allowed just one run in 14 innings of work while striking out 25 batters. Not too shabby.
In total, Brown boasts a disgusting 1.56 ERA and a solid WHIP of 0.94. The junior also leads the team in innings pitched (85.1), strikeouts (147), and wins (nine). By herself, she has more wins than six of the other seven Ivy League teams.
Indeed, the other seven squads in the Ancient Eight look pretty weak so far, as no team other than Harvard holds a winning record. At the very least, the Crimson looks like the safe pick to take the North Division for the second year in a row.
While league play has yet to begin in softball, men’s and women’s lacrosse are already duking it out in the Ivies. On the men’s side, last year’s Ancient Eight champion Cornell looks like the team to beat. The only squad still undefeated in league play, the Big Red has already earned its share of recognition—in three of the past four weeks, the Ivy League Player of the Week has gone to a Cornell player.
In women’s lacrosse, Penn, Dartmouth, and Princeton are all tied atop the league standings. But Harvard doesn’t look too bad either, thrashing Yale 19-3 on Mar. 26. In the contest, nine different Crimson players found the back of the net.

For those of you who wondered what British alternative rock band Radiohead meant when they announced last February that they were releasing the world's first "Newspaper Album," ponder no more. "The Universal Sigh," a bizarre conglomeration of short stories, poetry, lyrics, and art in a style similar to the album cover of their latest album, "The King of Limbs," is being released today, March 29, in conjunction with the physical album release of "Limbs." You can pick up a physical copy of the paper for free at Newbury Comics, according to the paper's official website.

B.good is offering a special deal this week to support the Harvard Classics Men's Club Basketball Team's efforts to raise funds to send 10 of its members to the Men's Club Basketball National Championship.
Gift cards valued at $20 can be purchased online for $12 through Sponstir, a new group-buying website created by former Harvard Classics member Daniel A. Sack '10 and his two brothers Matthew P. Sack '12 and Benjamin M. Sack '07. Four dollars from each purchase will go toward financing the team's trip to Austin, Texas for the championship games. Only 200 gift cards are being offered.
"If you like b.good, please, please, please get some of these gift cards," Nicholas G. Purcell '11 said. "We really need the help, and you get some delicious burgers."
In their first year playing in the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Regional Basketball Championship at Boston University, the Harvard Classics beat 23 other college teams to win the tournament. Their victory qualified them for the national championship in Austin.
"We ran a JV program until two years ago, so we weren't allowed to participate in the tournament," Purcell said. "This is the first year we're playing in it at all. It's kind of surprising that we made it at first try."
The Harvard Classics will be playing against teams from seven different regions at the Men's Club Basketball National Championship at the University of Texas at Austin from April 1-3. The team needs $7,500 to cover the cost of airplane tickets, rental vans, hotel fees, and other expenses.

Imagine this: you walk into the dining hall, stomach growling, and realize to your dismay that Korean BBQ really has vanished. Instead of reaching for yet another plate of squash, you can now spice up your dining experience thanks to "The FLP Cookbook: A Field Guide to Dining Hall Ingenuity," which may be the answer to your dining hall blues.
"HUHDS, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services, provides so many ingredients," said Celia Y. Zhang '13, Dunster House FLP rep.
"You look at the entrees, you look at the sandwich bar, the salad bar, the grill bar—it's just amazing how many raw materials there are. With so many different choices, the combinations are pretty much limitless," Zhang said.
Now available in all Harvard dining halls, the colorful hard-cover cookbook features a plethora of recipes for breakfasts, sandwiches, paninis, salads, entrées, sides, snacks, desserts, sauces, and dressings that can all be made with staple ingredients found in the dining halls.
According to Zhang, the cookbook was compiled from a variety of sources, including favorite dining hall recipes from FLP reps, student submissions, and winning concoctions from Harvard's "Top Chef" competition.
"I definitely encourage people to look through it and find a new favorite dish," Zhang said. "Be amazed at the amount of creativity you can get out of the dining hall."

Ever wonder what the mastermind behind the "Nutty Professor" is up to these days? Come to Boylston Hall from 6:30 p.m. - 8:30 p.m. on Thursday to see an advanced screening of "I AM," the newest work of Tom Shadyac, director of classic comedies such as "Bruce Almighty," "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," and the "Nutty Professor."
The screening, to be held in Fong Auditorium, will be followed by a brief question and answer session with Shadyac. Slots are limited, so email HUTVevents@gmail.com as soon as possible to RSVP for the event.
"I AM," Shadyac's first foray into non-fiction, is, according to the documentary's official website, "a prismatic and probing exploration of the world, what's wrong with it, and what we can do to make it better." The film chronicles Shadyac's search for truth and meaning in life after a cycling accident nearly killed him in 2007.
Sanyee Yuan '12, executive of events and strategy for HUTV, strongly encouraged students to attend the screening and question and answer session. Yuan felt that the message of the film would resonate strongly with the lives and experiences of many undergraduates.
"It [the film] shows that sometimes what we are striving so highly for is not something we should care a lot about—we should care about the people around us," Yuan said. "It's funny that it's called 'I AM,' because the message that comes across is 'we are.'"
