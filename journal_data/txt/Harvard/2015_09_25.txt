After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Some people claim that life is not making love to them… I thought: one must want to make love to life,” muses Frances, one of the protagonists in Rebecca Dinerstein’s thoughtful debut novel, “The Sunlit Night.” Echoing this sentiment, Yasha, the novel’s other protagonist, questions the claims that “some people” make about life. Frances and Yasha also both take action when, through no fault of their own, their lives become challenging and stressful. Set against a backdrop of a remote island in the Far North, the novel follows the pair as they not only take solace in one another but also strive “to make love to life,” messy though it may be. Dinerstein artfully arranges her language in simple yet touching sentences throughout “The Sunlit Night,” and, in doing so, she masterfully explores the tentative love between these two grieving strangers.
Dinerstein opens the novel with the two disparate yet equally powerful backstories, priming the reader to meditate on Frances’s and Yasha’s acute loneliness. Stifled by her parents in a Manhattan apartment and jilted by her college beau, Frances decides to escape to an artist colony on Lofoten, an archipelago off the coast of Norway. Aside from previously learning about the colony’s only artist, Nils, Frances has little to justify her flight except her desire to leave her parents and their bickering about her sister’s impending marriage behind. “Maybe I could learn something about the world’s brightness from that man [Nils] and his yellow paint,” Frances thinks, initially more to reassure herself than from genuine excitement about the trip. “Maybe I could learn to be alone.” Across the East River in Brooklyn, eighteen-year-old Yasha also feels alone. Abandoned by his mother, he and his Russian immigrant father, Vassily, run a bakery in Brighton Beach until Vassily dies from heart failure. Out of place in the city and now without a family, Yasha travels to Lofoten because Vassily wished “to be buried at the top of the world.” Leaving behind their separate New York City experiences—and the places and faces associated with their painful memories—ultimately does not guarantee Frances and Yasha relief from their own problems. Instead, Dinerstein uses this escaping-one’s-life structure to create a logical path which leads the two to connect in Lofoten.
Throughout the novel, Dinerstein’s simple language packs a punch, highlighting the characters’ believable motivations to leave their dysfunctional homes and to learn how to deal with themselves. When Yasha works at the bakery after his father has died, for example, he simply goes through the motions of day-to-day activities without connecting to his life in the present: “Saturday. Swarm of bagel customers, dearth of poppy seeds, Vassily’s pants drenched in a bowlful of spilled eggs, Yasha’s shoes untied, Yasha’s shoelaces dragging through the egg yolks, the cat licking the floor all morning, Vassily many times kicking the cat, Vassily apologizing, talking to the cat, frightening the customers. The customers, usual. The Danishes, a little sour. No mother, no mother, no mother.” Alone and in pain, Yasha makes observations but does not log them in his brain. And he certainly does not connect with others. Dinerstein draws out this theme of isolation throughout the novel, and her choice to do so ultimately works in setting the stage for events that follow.
Dinerstein’s lyrical prose first focuses on Frances and Yasha independently as they struggle with their own issues and long for a change of scene. Indeed, in Lofoten the two do not meet right away. Frances arrives several weeks before Yasha and has time to acclimate to the people-less island and to her patchwork routine in a local artist colony under the direction of Nils. But thinking about being alone and actually being alone do not prove to be the same. Dinerstein here uses curt, charged sentences to illustrate Frances’s budding discovery that being by herself is not all that she hoped it would be: “‘Where are you going?’ [Frances] said. ‘Town,’ [Nils] said. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Town,’ [Frances] said, thrilled that there was such a place.” Without extraneous description or explanation of each word spoken, Dinerstein crafts distinct characters and carefully shapes their personalities throughout the novel in many similar exchanges. More than the characters’ actions, the conversations here speak for themselves.
A tight read, “The Sunlit Night” delves into Frances’s and Yasha’s individual thought processes and actions rather than the exact words they say. Giving her characters breathing room, Dinerstein peppers the novel with punchy one-liners, bursting with stripped-down, unpretentious insight. Take, for example, one of Frances’s and Yasha’s first encounters, where only one full sentence passes between the two. What comes out seems trivial, but Dinerstein shows that the deeper feelings reside realistically in their heads: “‘What’s your name?’ Yasha asked. ‘Frances,’ she said. She didn’t seem to have any interest in him…. He had nothing in particular to say to her, but he wanted to keep her attention—her level, undemanding attention.” Yasha’s churning thoughts are weightier than what he asks Frances. The unspoken words make his question all the more poignant. In the silence between them, Frances and Yasha learn to lean on one another, even if doing so means that they must at times be apart.
At one point, Frances overthinks what her future with Yasha might look like. Dinerstein, however, succeeds in making sure such big-picture musings do not feel cliché: “If we both go back to New York, will we be going back together?” Frances thinks to herself, imagining Yasha’s voice taking over her restless mind. “If I am younger than you for the rest of my life, will you get older, and older, and older?” With these “what ifs” of life, Dinerstein skillfully paints a picture of two young people who have left it all behind to figure it out on their own. In a powerful—albeit expected—turn of events, Frances and Yasha realize that “to make love to life” they need one another. “The Sunlit Night” ultimately triumphs because of this no-frills premise, which Dinerstein uses effectively to strike an emotional chord.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Independent’s Sex Survey is an annual source of amusement for me. I love reading about my anonymous classmates’ sexual exploits, but it always gets me thinking: How many of us are actually aware of what safer sex looks like, and how many of us properly put that safer sex into practice? How many of us know what consent looks like in practice? While educational standards in subjects like math or English tend to be relatively standardized across the country, the standards for sex education in the United States are all over the place—a “hot mess,” so to speak.
Let’s be honest. Sex happens. It happens to college students. It also happens before college. We don’t talk about it, but it happens. How many Americans under 21 are denied a proper education before they have sex for the first time?
Let me pause here and explain what I mean by a “proper education.” Proper sex education is medically accurate. Proper sex education is culturally appropriate and age appropriate. Proper sex includes information on multiple forms of STI and pregnancy prevention–not just abstinence. Proper sex education teaches us how to ask for and give affirmative consent. Especially in light of recent survey results, I’m inclined to say that we’re all deserving of a proper sex education.
Other countries have beaten us to the punch on this one. The Netherlands made headlines earlier this year for their comprehensive sexuality education curriculum, which starts in schools when kids are as young as four years old. The conversation begins with having crushes and giving consent to hugs and other forms of nonsexual intimacy. In later years, the curriculum introduces conversations about self-image and gender, finally arriving at conversations about sexual orientation and contraceptive options. Seems legit.
The results speak for themselves. The World Bank reports that the 2013 teen birth rate in the Netherlands was close to one-seventh of the U.S. teen birth rate. I’d like to hope that there’s a causative relationship between unplanned pregnancy in adolescents and the quality of the sexuality education that they receive in school. What is the U.S. doing wrong?
Let’s take, for example, my home state. New York—a seemingly progressive place. I did some research to contextualize my own disappointing experiences with sex education in school. The shocker: Sex education actually isn’t mandated in New York’s public schools. Further, New York has no legislative requirements for sex education when public schools choose to provide it. Though it was vastly incomplete, I received any sexual education at all only because I happened to attend a public school, one that radically decided to give its students an awkward briefing on their sexualities. In fact, only 22 states plus Washington, D.C., mandate sex education. Only 13 states require that sex education be medically accurate. I guess the rest of the nation’s sex educators can pull their information from simply wherever—and I’m not confident that our parents can handle the medically accurate conversations that we need answered on their own.
I’m sure that some New Yorkers receive age appropriate, culturally competent, inclusive sexuality education. I just wasn’t one of them. My sex education emphasized abstinence, focused on grossing me out with pictures of sexually transmitted diseases, and taught me nothing about how to have safer sex as a lesbian. I walked away from health class with a vague understanding of the risks of sex, the importance of condoms in HIV prevention, and the value of abstinence in preventing the spread of STIs. That’s a good sign, since New York does mandate discussion of HIV prevention that includes information on condoms while stressing abstinence. But there is so much more to say about sex.
In addition to information gaps in sex education, there’s an awkwardness that surrounds the conversation. If we’re just talking about how to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy, we’re having an incomplete conversation. How can we normalize sex and sexuality? Why do sex education programs mobilize fear as a teaching tool? Why aren’t sex education programs required to emphasize consent in each and every sexual and nonsexual encounter we have? How can we include diverse sexualities and gender identities in conversations about STIs and unintended pregnancy prevention?
I’d like to see sexuality education that focuses on sexuality as a part of a broader humanity. Most humans are sexual beings. Humans experience sexual attraction in different ways, and those differences are completely okay. There are safe and unsafe ways to act on sexual attraction, and partners should have a conversation about how they will be safe in their sexual encounters beforehand. Acting on sexual attraction should only occur when everyone gives consent to those actions. It’s normal to take pleasure when safely and consensually acting on sexual attraction. It’s really that simple. There are clear ways to translate these concepts into different age-appropriate and culturally competent contexts. In fact, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States has already done it.
Learning how to talk about my body without blushing, learning that saying no and saying yes are important parts of sex, and learning that my attractions are normal—these are really basic components of the comprehensive sex education that I didn’t receive. Comprehensive discussion of my identity, my body, my safety, and my rights would have been incredibly helpful for high-school me. I’m glad we’ve got Sex Week and Sexual Health And Relationship Counselors (formerly PCC) on campus, but our pre-college sex educations could have probably been better, right? Advocating for standardized comprehensive sexuality education is the next step toward removing the awkwardness and increasing the safety, pleasure, and comfort of each and every encounter we engage in.

Confession: When I feel shitty, I shop.
This past summer, I battled mono for a few months. Chronically fatigued, I found that I rarely had the energy to do things I’d previously found enjoyable and relaxing, like taking my sister to our favorite department store in New York City.
After being quarantined for weeks, I rallied one day and left my house to make the pilgrimage from 88th St. to Bloomingdale’s on 59th. I arrived at the department store in one piece, but the travel left me feeling depleted. My mood began to spiral. Could it be that after weeks of being sick, I still wasn’t better? Would I ever again be able to take a walk or hold a conversation without feeling worn out? Why me? Melodrama engulfed my thoughts like an oversized sweater—specifically, the kind that envelops you in comforting softness and is conducive to mourning lost love or simply moping. I’d been wearing something like that earlier. 
The point of this shopping trip had been to shed my sloppy sweater and the self-pity that I always seemed to wear with it. Clearly, that wasn’t happening. Imagine my surprise, then, when I absentmindedly slipped my foot into a sky-high wedged sandal—clunky, funky, and covered in what looked like couch upholstery—and instantly felt uplifted. Emotionally, that is.
I know what you’re thinking: I’m superficial. And I am, a little.
But I am claiming ownership, once and for all, of my right to feel high—on life—in a pair of heels. And I’m insisting that I need not be embarrassed about it.
Because guess what? You’re superficial too.
Whether or not you’re willing to admit it, your mood is just as malleable as mine, and likewise incredibly responsive to seemingly trivial cosmetic changes. Because all it takes for your psychology to be profoundly altered by a sweet pair of kicks is for you to put ‘em on.
After centuries of believing that the mind and body were separate entities à la Descartes, scientists everywhere began uncovering compelling evidence to the contrary. At Northwestern University, Dr. Adam Galinsky recently determined that people adopt certain mental capacities depending on the connotations associated with their clothes.
In a study conducted in Dr. Galinsky’s lab, researchers directed two groups of participants to don identical white coats. Group One was told that these coats belonged to a doctor, while Group Two believed that the coats belonged to an artist. Remarkably, the group who believed that their coats belonged to doctors showed a drastic improvement in their ability to pay attention, while the other group showed no such psychological change.
This idea that our bodily circumstances affect our mind is called “embodied cognition,” and it’s a relatively new theory to the world of science. This principle is exactly what governs my shoe department scenario. Though I didn’t know it at the time, there is a reason why I felt less slovenly when I buckled those awesome party shoes to my feet. Simply because I assumed that their wearer would be fun-loving, confident, and energetic—the opposite of sickly, lethargic me—I subconsciously allowed those shoes to influence my feelings and positively alter my psyche.
I bet you’ve experienced this too. Think about how your mood transforms as you get ready for a party. It’s hard to feel bored or blasé once you’ve donned a sharp tuxedo or put the finishing touches on a sick smoky eye.
Further experiments by Professor Karen Pine at the University of Hertfordshire produced fascinating implications about the relationship between dressing and mental health. It turns out that certain patterns of dress strongly correlate with emotional states. For example, women tend to wear baggy, formless clothing when they feel depressed in order to draw less attention to themselves. The same study suggested that a simple outfit change might make it more likely for these women to feel like they can proactively address mental health issues and ultimately overcome crushing sadness.
This is remarkable. Sure, changing out of sweatpants won’t cure serious illness. However, this is empowering knowledge. Taking the time to fashion an outfit that makes me feel confident seems less trivial when I know that, in so doing, I’m reinforcing my self-confidence. And in light of Dr. Galinsky’s white lab coat studies, I’m apt to believe that I could engineer my outfit to induce any number of moods based on the memories I associate with my different articles of clothing.
Clothing, like all material goods, has limited intrinsic power. When I slide my foot into a show-stopping shoe, the rest of the world doesn’t shudder or shift on its axis.
But I, the wearer, do. I teeter and totter for a second—these wedges are extremely high, mind you—and then I right myself, and find that I’m equipped to reach for goals that had before seemed just beyond my reach.
Six inches beyond my reach, to be exact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the beginning of a new fiscal year for the federal government approaches—and with it, the need for at least a stopgap funding bill—Republican leaders are doubling down on their opposition to any government funding package that continues to support Planned Parenthood, the women’s healthcare group that has been a point of partisan divide in years past. Taxpayer money, conservatives in Congress have argued, has no place flowing to an organization that provides abortion services.
While Republicans—with majorities in both the House and the Senate—hold the government’s budget in the balance, they are putting forward a deeply flawed argument, grounded not in facts but rather in their disdain for abortion, that is proving ever more dangerous as the September 30 budget deadline nears.
Republicans have levied a number of arguments against federal support of Planned Parenthood, including the claim that taxpayer dollars are bankrolling abortions. Absent from Republican talking points, however, has been the fact that the federal government’s funding of Planned Parenthood does not contribute to its abortion services. Federal law bars the use of federal funds from paying for abortions; instead, the government helps support Planned Parenthood’s other services, including family planning and screenings for both cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. Furthermore, abortions make up only three percent of the services the non-profit provides.
Congressional Republicans have also turned to sensationalist tactics during the current budget stalemate. Conservatives have pointed in recent weeks to a the series of viral YouTube videos, which allegedly show Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of fetal tissue after partial-birth abortions, while conveniently ignoring the fact that the donation of this tissue to scientific research is in fact a legal practice. And, in the unedited version of the video, the Planned Parenthood employee makes clear that the sale is not for the sake of profit, but rather to cover the clinics’ costs. In short, any fair-minded examination of the evidence arrayed against Planned Parenthood shows the obvious inadequacy of those arguments.
That Republicans are threatening another government shutdown purely out of their contempt for abortion shows striking thoughtlessness and irresponsibility. It also highlights the GOP's foolishness: The 2012 presidential election marked the largest gender gap in American history, as the Democrats won over female voters by a 12-point margin. Should Republicans continue to endorse policies that trivialize women’s legal rights, there is little reason to think that 2016 will yield a different result.
Republicans presidential candidates have spared no rhetoric on the issue. Carly Fiorina called the current fight in Congress a test of “the character of our nation,” and Senator Ted Cruz described it as a “war on faith.” More than anything, however, the Republican’s stalwart position in budget negotiations has proven a war on effective government. Republicans’ refusal to pass a budget unless Planned Parenthood funding is removed signals a lack of fiscal stewardship and an irresponsible approach to governing. As the fiscal deadline approaches, it is high time for the Republicans in Congress to abandon their fabrications about Planned Parenthood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The following remarks were delivered at Morning Prayers at Memorial Church on Thursday, September 24, 2015:
In this season of atonement and new beginnings, amidst a visit from my Pope, I have a confession to make today: I am part of a problem.
Perhaps it all began my sophomore fall, 25 years ago, when I attended my first “punch” event at a final club. Such a peculiar word—“punch”—at once a term of belligerence and violence but also, at Harvard, of deliverance and privilege. To be “punched” is to be invited, chosen, distinguished from the rest. When I was an undergraduate here, it also meant you were a man.
I came to Harvard with a lot of baggage: I was a working class kid, an athlete and financial aid student, the product of public schools. I had a deep suspicion that I didn’t deserve to be here, that I would never fit in. My social and intellectual fears were deeply rooted in class anxiety, and this resulted in self-destructive behavior: worrying too much about what others thought of me, drinking too much on the weekends, silencing and sabotaging myself in the classroom.
Getting punched, I thought, would fix everything. This secret invitation was a sign of social acceptance, and I was all too eager to be accepted. Still, I was conflicted, in part, because so many of my friends, among them women and feminists, were opposed to my participation in this ancient patriarchal ritual.
It was because of this peer pressure that I dropped out of the punch process that year and worked to find other forms of community. But my desire for acceptance persisted, in part, because I had drunk too many beers in club basements, and spent too much time longing to go upstairs, envying those who could, and waiting in lines outside while friends whisked by me through those imposing doors. When I got a second chance my junior year, I jumped at the opportunity to become a member of the Phoenix. As absurd as it all seems now, at the time, I was relieved. I finally belonged here.
The truth of the matter is that I was now like David from today’s scripture (2 Samuel 11: 2-4), prowling atop the palace, leering at the lovely sights down below, sleeping with whomever was willing, then sending them home. Suddenly, the blue-collar boy who wanted to be someone—something—else had become a blue-blood pretender who could no longer recognize himself. Funny thing, privilege: It distorts even as it distinguishes.
This is what happens when younger men use older men’s mansions as private playgrounds, inoculated from accountability, free of the rules and regulations of both the College and the larger community. Now, women have some playgrounds of their own—and this fall, a handful of them have been invited to share the Spee.
It’s tempting to see the more recent examples of women getting access to this privilege as a sign of “progress,” but this week’s troubling revelations about the prevalence of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus offer a sobering reminder of our own incapacities. According to results from a 27-school sexual conduct climate survey released by the Association of American Universities on Monday, 29.2 percent of Harvard’s senior undergraduate women reported experiencing “non-consensual sexual contact” since coming to college (this includes attempted or completed penetration and sexual touching). Nearly three out of four—73 percent—of female undergraduates report having experienced some form of sexual harassment during their time at Harvard.
These are our students. To no one’s surprise, alcohol was cited as a “potent risk factor” in over 60 percent of instances that involved “force” and over 80 percent of those that involved “incapacitation.” 75 percent of sexual assault cases take place in residential dorms, while at least 15 percent of incidents occur at “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities.” In other words, final clubs are the second most common location for sexual assault at Harvard.
As my colleague David Laibson noted: “That result surprised me because I associate final clubs as non-residential spaces, and of course our students do not spend nearly as much time there as dormitories, and of course only a fraction of students have an affiliation. That number was an alarm bell for me.”
Equally alarming is students’ reported lack of faith in Harvard’s ability to deal with any of this. Only 16 percent of women surveyed said that the University is “very or extremely likely” to take action in sexual assault cases. This is a crisis of confidence that both comes from and compounds the crisis of violence. What’s more, Harvard students reported that they had failed, as bystanders, to intervene when they “witnessed a drunk person heading for a sexual encounter” (80 percent) or when they had “seen or heard someone who was acting in a sexually violent or harassing way” (54 percent). There is an unmistakable take-away from these findings: Harvard, we have a problem—and final clubs are part of the problem.
Now don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that all members of final clubs are rapists. Far from it. Some of my best friends, and favorite students, are in final clubs. These are complicated institutions, full of contradictions, like Harvard itself. For example, the Spee is not the first club to contemplate changing its single-sex membership policy. We had this debate when I was in college, but the graduate boards made it clear that they would never allow this to happen.
Patriarchy played a big role in this, of course, but it wasn’t the whole story. For instance, I know that the all-male clubs provided a “safe space” for closeted gay men from a different era who did not or could not “come out.” In more recent years, I’ve witnessed more intentional, internal efforts to combat the institutionalized racism that has long plagued the clubs, which has resulted in some being more racially and ethnically diverse—and integrated—than many formally recognized student organizations. And it remains true that on a campus that struggles to create vibrant social spaces, the clubs continue to fill a void that the College hasn’t fully addressed.
But complexity should never exempt us from criticism. And that is why I refuse to let the final clubs and their members—past and present, myself included—off the hook. I’ve been at the parties and gone through the punch process. I’ve laughed at the jokes and listened to the rumors. I’ve stood idly by in the face of elitism and exclusion, and contributed to the toxic culture that creates the conditions for harassment and assault. I know that sex, both consensual and forced, has taken place in those spaces. And I know that sexual violence is the product of social violence. The final clubs are incubators of both.
That is why they must change. They must abolish the “punch” process, now underway, and become open to all genders and backgrounds—or they must cease to exist. We live in the 21st century. It is time for us to stop clinging to the past and start embracing the future.
I, too, must change. That’s why I’ve chosen this week to say that I am no longer a member of the Phoenix.
My prayer this morning is complicated: that you will accept my resignation from—rather than to—this particular Harvard problem. I will not, however, pray for your mercy or forgiveness, because I deserve neither. I know that some people will dismiss or deride what I’m doing here today, but I hope that they might see it for what it is: not an act of bravery—far from it—but rather a belated attempt to resolve a burning contradiction between my stated values and the cowardice and complicity that have compromised them ever since I first stepped foot on this campus a generation ago. May all of us respond to this week’s disturbing revelations by rising from the ashes of assault into a new awakening, where we work harder than ever to end the violences—and silences—that have destroyed too many lives for far too long in this beloved community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, History professor Alison F. Johnson’s already-frenetic schedule was punctuated with numerous meetings to consult with undergraduates, and other affiliates of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, as she prepared the school’s new sexual harassment procedures.
Monday—more than nine months after Johnson presented a final draft of those procedures to the Faculty—Harvard released the results of its sexual climate survey, pushing Johnson once more into action. Again, she engaged in those somber conversations with undergraduates, beginning her History seminar Tuesday by explaining the resources available to undergraduates who have been sexually harassed or assaulted.
“I just walked into the classroom, and I said, ‘OK, here’s what you need to know before you leave this class today,’” Johnson said.
A day earlier, shortly after the findings were released in a University-wide email, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith sent an email of his own, addressed only to the Faculty. In it, he urged faculty members to support students and new school-wide programs aimed at tackling the problem of sexual assault.
He wrote, “I hope you’re thinking, ‘What can I do?’”
The answer to that question was not immediately clear to faculty members, many of whom, like Johnson, say they are committed to effecting change in the wake of Monday’s news that 31 percent of senior women at the College surveyed reported being victims of some kind of sexual misconduct. While the roles of administrators and students in addressing issues of sexual assault are scrutinized, faculty members have found themselves on uncertain ground, not sure of their own role in solving an issue that Monday revealed affects so many of their students.
Many professors insisted, like Johnson, that they should not and would not remain on the sidelines. They have a legal obligation under Title IX to report cases of sexual assault to proper authorities if students tell them they have been sexually assaulted. It starts there, faculty members said: That spirit of being present in a time of need underpins their role.
Faculty members of all departments and with varying degrees of involvement with crafting sexual assault policies on campus felt compelled to speak to undergraduates in their classes this week about the many facets of the crisis. They include professors from a wide range of fields and schools, all of whom teach undergraduates—University professor Laurel Ulrich, History of Science professor Sophia Roosth, Harvard Divinity School professor Ahmed Ragab, Applied Physics professor David Keith, and Kennedy School of Government lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, among others.
Faculty members’ responsibility moving forward, then, folds into a central duty of their profession, said Divinity School professor David L. Carrasco: to connect with students outside the classroom.
“Students are on campus for their whole day,” he said. “It’s a very different world from lectures and sections.”
This non-academic world is one with which Johnson said she is already partly familiar. Because she consulted with many students while creating FAS's Title IX procedures, she said she was not surprised with the survey's results.
She said she is disappointed, though, that a low percentage of students did not know how to report a case of sexual assault. Johnson said she feels it is her responsibility to be available for students who may need guidance and point them to on-campus professionals.
Of course, Johnson said, the end goal is to prevent sexual assault from happening in the first place. But having constant conversations is a good place to start.
“It’s important for me to help make this a topic that seems like a normal thing for us to talk about in the course of our training students and the course of our interacting with students,” Johnson said. “Rather than a special conversation when it hits the news in particularly explosive way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two undergraduates sat in an otherwise empty Lamont Library classroom. Buzzwords from earlier sections remained scrawled and smudged on the blackboard: “outlier,” “sufficient data,” “confounding variables,” “robustness.”
It was 7:05 p.m. on Tuesday, and the Economics Question Center was not hopping with p-setters.
One of the two students was Connor A. Denney ’15, the EQC peer tutor on duty. The other student was Denney’s friend, who does not take any classes in the Economics department.
“There’s going to be a lot more people coming by later in the semester,” Denney said. “This is only my second day working.”
The EQC, which debuted without much traffic last semester, was designed to serve as a central hub for tutoring in select foundational economics courses. Open Sunday through Thursday from 7 to 9 p.m., the EQC offers students “additional help on homework questions and tricky economics concepts,” according to its website.
The EQC’s courses of instruction include Economics 1010: “Intermediate Microeconomics,” Economics 1011: “Intermediate Microeconomics: Advanced,” Economics 1123: “Introduction to Econometrics,” and Economics 1126: “Quantitative Methods in Economics.”
Trent A. Nelson ’16, one of the center’s student founders, had not responded to a request for comment as of Thursday afternoon.
A little later into the evening on Tuesday, Seth A.G. Brand ’19 arrived at the EQC, questions for Denney in tow. “Do you guys get a lot of people?” Brand asked. “Do you know if the third problem set is up?”
Brand said he found the EQC by looking online and wanted to “come and try it out.”
“I’m here because I thought the [Ec 1010] questions would be up,” he said. And when Brand and Denney discovered that the questions had not been posted, Brand added, “I think I’m going to go to the Writing Center.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students debate the College’s responsibility to provide them with social spaces on campus to combat the dominance of off-campus groups, administrators are putting their money where their mouths are, initiating several new projects in attempts to bolster social life in the Houses.
Both Cabot and Adams Houses are opening renovated spaces for students to book parties and events, and the Queen’s Head Pub now offers new programming specifically tailored to undergraduates.
On a campus where extracurriculars are social currency and “social space” is a new buzzword, administrators are pushing to move the center of social life back to the Houses, which have struggled to establish themselves as the purported “cornerstone” of undergraduate life. 
Among other initiatives, Cabot House will soon open up a renovated version of its junior common room, according to co-master Stephanie Khurana. It has been dubbed “The Aquarium” (the House’s mascot is a fish).
Khurana said the space will serve as an open place where undergraduates can convene or register to host events. Within the past year, undergraduates and administrators alike have argued about perceived exclusivity in the College’s social scene and the lack of open social spaces on campus. According to Khurana, the Cabot space aims to address those issues.
“It’s clear that there’s a demand for open, inclusive spaces, not ones where you have to be a member or know somebody to go to,” she said.
Tyler W. Creamer ’16, the treasurer of Cabot House Committee who helped plan the space, said the idea came about last year when some seniors in Cabot hosted a series of large parties. They held one in the House’s junior common room.
Last spring, Creamer said, he and House administrators including Rakesh Khurana—Cabot’s other House master, and the dean of the College—met to plan the renovations. Over the summer, the House removed two of the room’s windows and repurposed a small kitchen into a dark-stained wooden bar, according to Creamer. Planners also added a granite countertop and kegerator—used to refrigerate kegs—to the area, he said.
The space has two main purposes, according to Creamer: to house recurring large parties in Cabot with student bands, and to serve as a “turnkey” room for students to host their own events. The House will probably fund large events at least in part, said Creamer, a former Crimson business associate.
Creamer hopes “people will throw more parties in the Houses and seek to go off campus to do events less than they otherwise would” because of the space, he said.
Adams House, meanwhile, also plans to open up a room for undergraduate residents to use on the weekends for private parties. Called “the Molotov” and tucked behind a door marked with the word “Explosives” in Adams’s D Entryway, the red-and-yellow painted room underwent renovation following student requests, according to Adam Muri-Rosenthal, the resident dean in Adams. It will include a bar and refrigerator, and new furniture is on its way.
If the pilot program goes well, Muri-Rosenthal said, the House may open up similar spaces in the future.
“Most of the really nice social spaces are exclusive social spaces,” Muri-Rosenthal said, referring to existing locations. “We’ve been hearing a lot of students call for new safe social spaces on campus.”
Santiago Pardo Sanchez ’16, Adams House Committee co-chair, said plans for the room were in the works before the campus-wide debate over social spaces reached its now-fevered pitch; he called it “a very convenient coincidence.” The room’s inaugural party is this Friday.
Along with a push to bring social life back into the Houses, the Office of Student Life is also offering more programming—including live student bands and DJs—in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, located in the basement of Annenberg, according to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
“There's been a perception that it is a space for graduate students,” Friedrich said. “We're really trying some new strategies this year with the leadership of the pub to really carve out ways to say to undergraduates, 'This is a space for you.’”
Final clubs, meanwhile, continued to host first-round punch events this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Women’s Center will relaunch the Women’s Cabinet, a group consisting of leaders from the College’s women-focused organizations, this October. The cabinet will meet once a month to discuss issues around women and gender on campus.
According to Eesha Khare ’17, one of the student leaders developing the Women’s Cabinet, the group will address topics including Harvard’s final clubs, the Hasty Pudding Club, and the recently published results of the sexual conduct climate survey.
These discussions come shortly after the Spee Club, one of Harvard’s final clubs, announced it would invite women to participate in its punch process for the first time this fall.
Khare said the Spee’s decision to go co-ed highlights the need for different women’s groups to have a constructive dialogue together about these issues.
“In my opinion it’s actually really hard to get a single opinion from women’s groups on campus,” Khare said regarding women students’ reaction to the Spee’s move to add women.
“There are a range of opinions that we often don’t get to hear about,” Khare said, adding that the Women’s Cabinet will help give the Women’s Center a broader understanding of issues concerning female students.
For her part, Naisha Bradley, the director of the Harvard College Women’s Center, said she is excited about “bringing light to the issues that are on women’s minds here and strengthening the voice of women” across different classes, races, and religions.
“What I’m trying to do is allow the Women’s Cabinet to be a restorative space for those students,” Bradley added.
Although women’s groups are still in the process of joining the Women’s Cabinet, Bradley said about 21 groups on campus have expressed interest in participating.
According to Elaine Dai ’17, another student leader who is organizing the cabinet, student groups have until Monday to apply for membership.
In order to strengthen the voice of women at Harvard, the Women’s Cabinet will be “sharing best practices for organizational longevity, providing funding for cosponsored programming, and increasing dialogue amongst women students to build bridges of understanding across areas of interest,” according to its website.
The Women’s Cabinet’s first official meeting will take place on Oct. 19. The cabinet will host an initial welcome event on Oct. 15.

What started as a plan to host a formal party event amidst fresh vegetables and garden hoes on the patch of grass and dirt in front of Lowell House last weekend went awry when it drew interest from many hundreds of students, prompting concern from College administrators.
The proposed party, dubbed a “Farmal,” was supposed to host undergraduates and others at the Harvard Community Garden last Saturday night, but it was canceled after nearly 4,000 people indicated plans to attend on Facebook.
The garden, located on a patch of land in front of Lowell House on Mount Auburn Street, has a capacity of about 100 people, according to Margiana R. Petersen-Rockney, an adviser to the garden. In an effort to control the number of attendees, students organizing the party moved to a ticketing system, offering 400 free tickets to Harvard students and 200 $5 tickets to area residents, according to Logan N. Balliett ’16, a student involved in planning. They ran out in 24 hours.
They could not, however, ticket the event without a one-day entertainment license, per Cambridge city policy. With so much interest, organizers turned to the College’s Office of Student Life for guidance on how to obtain the necessary license.
Their request, however, was met with concerns from administrators. According to Amy L. Vest, the OSL’s director of student programming, in discussion with organizers, she questioned the feasibility of the event, due to challenges related to space constraints, nearby construction, potential damage to the garden, and the sheer number of people expected to attend.
According to Balliett, Vest was specifically uncomfortable with the possibility that an unruly crowd would show up to the party. She declined to seek a license for the event.
Without funds from tickets sales, Balliett said, organizers could not pay for security, among other things, and recognizing Vest’s concerns, they decided to cancel the event.
“Imagine 4,000 people showing up, and there’s four garden kids trying to corral them all and try to control the situation,” said Camila Victoriano ’16, the publicity chair for the garden. “I mean, it would have been impossible.”
While event organizers say they understand the concerns about the party that the College raised, the cancellation nonetheless prompted questions about administrative support for inclusive social events. In canceling it, organizers updated the event Facebook page description to read that they were “saddened to announce this change since we were very excited to provide an open, inclusive event in a university where that is hard to find.”
In recent weeks, students and administrators alike have scrutinized the role of social space at the College. Specifically, administrators have criticized single-gender final clubs, raising concerns about the potential for alcohol abuse and sexual assault to occur on their off-campus properties. Students have also critiqued House renewal construction plans and the move away from private common rooms and bathrooms.
The Office of Student Life hosted a forum for student group leaders last week, and according to Vest, one student asked Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana a question about the party’s cancellation in relation to the ongoing conversation surrounding social spaces on campus.
For now, organizers plan to reschedule a smaller version of the event for next semester and limit it to Harvard students.
“I think we were all just surprised of how much interest there was, and I think this demonstrates, hopefully, that people are interested in the garden and also interested in the type of inclusive space the garden represents,” Petersen-Rockney said.

Two summers after the initial launch of HBX CORe, the Business School’s online “primer” on business fundamentals, College students who participated in the program reported general satisfaction, citing only few specific criticisms.
Since last year, HBX CORe has made a concerted effort to reach out to students at the College, partnering officially, and somewhat controversially, with the Undergraduate Council to inform students about the program.
Kylie Hung ’18, who took the course while interning in New York and, later, tutoring in China, said that CORe covered material that she wouldn’t have learned during the year.
“I definitely recommend it if you’re interested in learning about business, because I don’t think I would have taken any accounting courses in Harvard,” said Hung.
Uliana V. Savostenko ’16, who took the course from Armenia during her internship over the summer, praised HBX CORe as much more effective than her previous online experiences. She cited the combination of “videos, texts, and practice problems” that HBX CORe employs instead of a more traditional block of lecture.
Alina G. Muñoz ’18, who took the course from her home in New York, said that she enjoyed the community both virtually, through the course Facebook group, and physically, through HBX CORe networking events in New York. She also praised the peer-based academic support, offered through a unique chat feature throughout the modules.
“Whoever’s online [in the chat] would answer it pretty quickly,” said Muñoz. “There were always about 100 people online. You could see who was online at all times and where they were in the world.”
But while students were, on the whole, positive, they cited some criticisms ranging from false advertising about the amount of time the program would take to frustrations with the online learning environment.
Savostenko reported that the the program took her around 15 hours per week, significantly more than she had anticipated.
“I feel like when they advertise it, it’s like ‘12 hours per week,’ [but] in reality it’s not that easy to combine an internship and the CORe classes,” said Savostenko.
According to Hung, peers often complained of technical difficulties with CORe.
“The site crashes a lot, but it didn’t affect me because I guess I was [online] when no one else was on,” said Hung. “But the site did have technical issues and crashed during some of the most important times. It kind of messed up people’s schedules.”
Hung said that she also found communication within an online environment challenging.
“I realized that I was not a good virtual learner. [HBX CORe] was my first time taking an online course, and some of the material was a bit new to me,” she said. “It’s kind of difficult if you have no one to ask.”
At press time, HBX representatives had not responded to a number of questions sent on Wednesday night, including a request for statistics on the number of students at the College who enrolled this summer and the performance of last summer’s College students in the CORe program.

David R. Odo, a research curator and director of student programs at the Harvard Art Museums, discussed the tie between photography and cultural studies during a lecture and book signing Thursday evening at the University Museum.
Odo pointed out the value of early photography in studying the interaction between Japan and the West in the 19th century, a subject in his new book, "The Journey of 'A Good Type': From Artistry to Ethnography in Early Japanese Photographs."
He argued for a closer relationship between art and scientific study, adding that he believes that more interdisciplinary study can lead to greater insight into human experiences.
“The contemporary way of separating things into such discrete disciplines might not be the best approach to thinking about all the work that human beings do,” he said. “Wonderful new things can come from breaking down those barriers and thinking about, in my case, photographs or objects from a lot of different vantage points.”
Odo discussed the inspiration for his book, a photograph by a Western photographer of a Japanese geisha in a kimono that he found at the Peabody Museum archives. The collector, William Sturgis Bigelow, had written on the photograph that it was a “good type” of anthropological print representing Japan.
“He essentially transformed this souvenir or tourist photograph into a scientific image,” Odo said.
He said that this picture caused him to consider the way that the manner and framing of 19th century photography portrayed Western attitudes towards Japan. He added that these photographs staged the Japanese as exotic.
The photographs that Odo studied are also part of an exhibit, “From Artistry to Ethnography in Early Japanese Photographs,” at CGIS.
Portrait artist Bettina K. Burch, who was present at the lecture and had helped Odo design the exhibit, said the experience of helping with the project challenged her to consider photography’s anthropological value.
“It gets me to think about how my art might be viewed in the future,” she said.
Odo’s exhibit at CGIS will run through September 27.

Students supporting the frontrunners for the 2016 Democratic nomination for President, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, met Thursday evening to debate the merits and viewpoints of the rival candidates.
Hosted by the Harvard Political Union, the debate covered topics ranging from income inequality to campaign finance to foreign policy, questions that have repeatedly surfaced in the two candidates’ campaign rhetoric. Ana Moran ’17 and Wright Smith ’17 debated in favor of Clinton, while Alex Young ’16 and Jonah Saltzman ’17 represented Sanders.
Though the first primary is months away, the Harvard Political Union is aiming to inform Harvard students and affiliates about their choices in the Democratic race.
“We’re trying to highlight the differences between candidates,” Raya Koreh ’18 said. “I want people to know what they’re supporting.”
Doubting one of Sanders’s most visible opinions—against the use of corporate and super PAC money in politics—the Clinton supporters said that to reject money from large corporations and millionaires would be tantamount to handing Republican opponents the election.
For their part, Sanders’s supporters criticized Clinton on her foreign policy record, saying she was doing the same as the politicians before her and that her willingness to use military action would result in even more violence against Americans.
Moran and Smith returned, however, with criticisms of key policy objectives of the Sanders campaign, saying that his status as an independent leaves him without any connections to Congress or any way to work with members of Congress to pass legislation.
Although the event highlighted divisions among the Democratic Party’s top candidates, it sought also to provide a forum for unity. Koreh opened the floor for audience members, some of whom proceeded to strategize the best way to secure a Democratic victory over Republican opponents in 2016.
The four debaters said that their interest in partaking in the event was a result of their passion for politics and their enjoyment of debate. They also wanted to inform audience members of each candidate’s viewpoints and the ways in which they differ. Representatives from both sides also said that they considered their debate opponents friends.
“I’m very satisfied,” Smith, one of the Clinton debaters, said in regards to the outcome of the debate and the audience participation. “I think we both did fantastically.”

UPDATED: October 2, 2015, at 2:20 a.m.
Twelve more Harvard College seniors were named to the Class of 2016’s Senior Class Committee on Thursday, representing several upperclassman Houses, but overwhelmingly hailing from the River.
The 12 new committee members—six elected “program marshals” and six marshals appointed to oversee the annual Senior Gift fund—are tasked with representing their classmates this year alongside First and Second Class Marshals Reylon A. Yount ’16 and Jessica A. Barzilay ’16, who seniors elected last week. 
The Harvard Alumni Association announced the marshals’ selection in an email to undergraduate seniors early Thursday evening. Only one lives in the Quad and seven are women.
The six program marshals, who were chosen in a round of voting on Tuesday, will plan class-wide events, including senior bars and other social events leading up to graduation.
“I love event planning, so it’s such a great honor to be able to do it for my class instead of just Adams House,” said Annie V. Dang ’16, a newly elected program marshal who also serves as Adams House Committee co-chair.
As in previous years, many of the marshals said they want to focus on planning events that are both physically and financially accessible.
“I would really like to get out into Boston as a class, whether that’s through outings like sporting events or pub crawls, having some sort of way of getting out there, but also making it accessible,” Irfan Mahmud ’16 said.
The gift marshals, who in the past formed a separate gift committee loosely associated with the other marshals, now fall directly under the Senior Class Committee, according to Barzilay, who is also a Crimson editor. The gift marshals were selected through an application and interview process by the Harvard College Fund with the approval of the first and second marshals and will now coordinate fundraising and solicit donations from classmates for the Class of 2016’s Senior Gift fund.
“The thing I’m the most excited about in this position is to use the Senior Gift as a way to bring the class together in terms of reflecting on our Harvard experience,” gift marshal Kia C. Turner ’16 said. “I don’t think we get a lot of opportunities to do that as undergraduates.”
Although Senior Gift has been criticized in the past, for Kevin Liang ’16, becoming a gift marshal is personal.
“One of the main reasons why I am able to come to this College is because of financial help from alumni donors and sponsors,” Liang said. “So having that connection to alumni giving back to the College made me really in touch and dedicated to the position.”
Along with Yount and Barzilay, the marshals will together appoint a secretary, treasurer, media team, and House representatives to round out the group. 
Program Marshals
Annie V. Dang ’16, Adams House
Jenny Gao ’16, Kirkland House
Jennifer F.N. Kizza ’16, Winthrop House
Jen J. Liu ’16, Quincy House

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 25, 2015, at 3:11 p.m.
From returning key players to maintaining game strategies to repeating season goals, the dominant theme for the 2015 Harvard football team is continuity.
Perhaps no group illustrates this trend more clearly than the collection of skill players who will catch passes, find holes, and throw blocks this season.
The continuity is staggering: Seven of the eight leading receivers from last year have returned, and the Crimson brings back the players responsible for 79 percent of its rushing yards.
Back is senior Paul Stanton, the All-Ivy rusher who averaged 110 yards per game and led Harvard with 11 touchdowns.
Back is senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer, the man who won the Harvard-Yale game by hauling in a last-minute touchdown.
Back is junior starting tight end Anthony Firkser, fifth-year wideout Seitu Smith II, and a slew of other experienced offensive weapons.
In fact, maybe the only thing that is new is a preseason conviction that the 2015 offensive unit can reach historic heights.
“With our depth this year, we have the potential to be one of the best offenses that this program has ever seen,” Smith said. “We have all our skill guys returning…. We’ve won three titles since I’ve been here, so I stick to the claim.”
Much of this hype depends on the play of Smith and Fischer, the pair of off-field friends who have competed both with and against each other since Fischer arrived on campus in 2012. Even back then, Smith said that he saw potential in Fischer, but it would have taken a true yogi to envision this level of success three years later.
“I’ve known Fisch since before he even got in and that he was going to come in and have a major role,” Smith said. “From there, it’s just me and him, and we’ve been rolling since.”
For the second-consecutive season, Smith and Fischer will crouch down at the line as the team’s starting wideouts. In 2014, they combined for 75 catches and they show no signs of slowing.
Fischer is the more talkative one, bouncing up and down the sideline during end-of-practice scrimmages and chirping at any unlucky cornerbacks. Last Saturday, when the Crimson squared off against Rhode Island in Kingston, R.I., he was one of the first players out of the halftime locker room, and he sprinted out the full 100 yards before pulling into the team’s bench.
By contrast, Smith seems to have adopted the demeanor of the team’s elder statesman. In a group interview with other receivers, he spoke first and immediately placed attention on “the young guys.”
“As a unit, we haven’t lost too much at the skill positions,” he said. “Justice, Adam Scott, and a couple others have been really explosive for us, and we have a promising future.”
A promising future, yes, but also a promising present. Against the Rams, senior quarterback Scott Hosch targeted the duo early on, as both Smith and Fischer topped 50 yards.
Off-field closeness complements on-field success. As blockmates, Smith and Fischer spend much of their time together in what they described as an atmosphere of “friendly competition” in just about all spheres of life—even when playing EA Sports's FIFA.
“It’s just the competitive drive regardless of the activity,” Fischer said. “That’s the mentality that we both have, and that’s what allows us to be so successful.”
Yet the unique aspect of this year’s team is that the expectations extend beyond this pairing. Take the senior Stanton, who has now scored 30 touchdowns in his Crimson career, second-best in school history.
Stanton has seen heavy usage since his freshman year, when he had just 28 carries for 171 yards and a touchdown. He is a tough-nosed running back that hits holes hard and opponents harder.
Last season, Stanton finished with 990 yards on the ground, behind only Tyler Varga, the former Yale standout who signed with the Indianapolis Colts after graduation.
Stanton is also a receiving threat out of the backfield, topping 100 yards in each of the last two years. This ability has special value in an offensive scheme that values short routes early in the game to establish an offensive rhythm.
“Overall we have a lot of dynamic athletes,” Fischer said. “The depth allows us to do more with our offense, get away from the bread-and-butter plays, and expand our playbook.”
And Harvard returns yet another more skill-position starter from last year’s Harvard-Yale game. In 2014, Firkser tied Fischer with four touchdown catches; in the season opener against Rhode Island, the 220-pound tight end racked up 78 yards.
Fellow tight end Ben Braunecker was not far behind. On Saturday, he scored a late touchdown—a lofted pass from the 19-yard line—to build on a strong 2014 campaign in which he totaled 227 yards.
Experience lies up and down the rest of the roster, as tight ends Ryan Halvorson and Jack Stansell—a junior and sophomore respectively—and junior wide receiver Joseph Foster have also returned.
The positional depth is so great that as a reporter, it is difficult to know who to talk to. Any of eight or nine players could answer questions about personal development, team psyche, and season expectations.
However, it makes life easier when multiple players give the same answer. Such was the case last week when Fischer, Smith, and Foster were asked about individual goals for the season.
Foster stepped forward on that one: “Get a ring,” he said. “Same thing every year.” Fischer nodded, Smith nodded, and the interview ended like that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 25, 2015, at 2:57 p.m.
The defining moment of the 2014 Harvard football season came with 60 seconds left in The Game. A 35-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Conner Hempel to junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer propelled the Crimson to a 31-24 victory, an Ivy League championship, and an undefeated season.
In that moment, it was all about the offense. But the iconic sequence belies how Harvard actually arrived at that point.
Indeed, throughout the 2014 campaign, it was the defense that kept the Crimson within striking distance when the offense was struggling to click. It was the defense that finished the season allowing an average of just 12.3 points per game, good for the lowest total in the FCS.
As Harvard football enters 2015, it will rely on its defense once more as the program seeks its fourth Ancient Eight title in five years. A veteran unit anchored by the leadership of captain and linebacker Matt Koran will seek to provide the stability last year’s defense brought every Saturday. The squad hopes to play with the mentality that, no matter who suits up on the other side of the ball, the Crimson will play lights out from the first snap.
“I think all around defensively, we’re just one really good unit,” Koran said. “I think a huge part of that is just our energy and the leadership we bring on the field…. We’re flying around, we’re talking, we’re yelling, and we’re making big plays, big hits.”
Entering last season, Harvard had a number of question marks on the defensive side. While the defensive line boasted several established playmakers, the secondary featured considerable turnover and a host of unproven faces.
This year, most of those question marks are gone. To be sure, the unit loses the leadership and playmaking abilities of a host of 2015 standouts: defensive linemen Zack Hodges and Obum Obukwelu, linebacker Conner Sheehan, and defensive back Norman Hayes. But overall, the continuity is striking.
The top-ranked FCS scoring defense returns a trio of starters at linebacker, as well as three more in the secondary. Among these, senior linebacker Eric Medes is a three-year starter, and senior defensive back Sean Ahern was named First Team All-Ivy in 2014. Koran’s leadership, both on and off the field, has received praise from his coach and teammates.
When Harvard suits up Saturday under the lights against Brown, the Crimson faithful can rest slightly easier knowing that five of the team’s six leading tacklers last year will still be on the field.
“We’ve all played together before; we all have been on an undefeated team,” senior defensive back Chris Evans said. “Because of that, we know what it takes to win, [and] we know how to instill what we do every day in practice into the younger guys and make the team cohesive as a unit.”
If the defense has any outstanding question marks, they reside on the defensive line. No longer will opposing coordinators have to design their entire protection schemes around stopping Hodges.
But Harvard coach Tim Murphy emphasizes that while the program’s all-time sack leader cannot be replaced, the team possesses proven players ready to step up. Some of them—like seniors James Duberg and Doug Webb, who combined for five sacks last season—have received significant playing time in the past.
“I think [the defensive line is] really going to surprise people,” Murphy said. “It’s not like we’re playing freshmen or sophomores; these kids are juniors and seniors. They know the drill, and they understand the challenge.”
In its season-opening win last weekend, Harvard had little trouble containing a struggling Rhode Island offense. Despite surrendering 10 points in the second quarter, the Crimson defense forced either punts or turnovers-on-downs while shutting out its opponents in the second half.
Of course, the most potent offenses Harvard will face this year are still to come. Despite losing several weapons, Yale’s top-ranked 2014 Ivy offense returns a quarterback, Morgan Roberts, who led the Ivy League in total offense last year. Dual-threat quarterback Dalyn Williams of Dartmouth is having his name thrown around as a potential pro prospect. Ultimately, the legacy of the 2015 Crimson defense will depend on its performance in those contests.
“I think at the end of the day, the offense isn’t always going to be making plays, they’re not always going to be scoring touchdowns,” Koran said. “You need that solid defense to rely on.”
The identity of last year’s undefeated Harvard team was undoubtedly its defense. But Murphy cautions that continuity does not guarantee similar results. Perhaps the true measure of the unit’s success will depend on its ability to adjust to unforeseen obstacles and the challenges Ivy League coaches will throw its way—the whole time bending, but not breaking.
“This defensive unit has tremendous potential,” Murphy said. “But we have to go out and earn that reputation, earn that identity, and earn those wins one game at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The moment the ball is snapped, it becomes the center of attention for most of the players on the field.
On a run play, attention is concentrated on the handoff between the quarterback and running back and the subsequent movement of the ball downfield. In a passing sequence, receivers are locked in a carefully synchronized dance between themselves, the ball, and the passer.
The 11 players on the other side similarly have an interest in the pigskin—whether to sack the quarterback before he can air it out, pick the ball out of midair, or pry it out of a running back’s hands.
While each position may serve a unique purpose, if a different-colored jersey ends up with the ball at the end of the play, it’s a good sign for the defense. But there are, on every play, five players whose job will always be the exact opposite. That is, rather than seek the ball, it is their sole duty to keep the other team away from it. They may not fill “skill positions,” but anyone who sees them face up against charging 250-plus pound defensive linemen would be hard pressed to deny their abilities, despite their absence from the box score.
They are the offensive linemen and, for Harvard football, they are a critical component of the team’s current 15-game winning streak, second only in Division I football to Ohio State’s 16.
Given the injuries to many of the offense’s skill position players throughout the 2014 season, the undefeated record is slightly surprising. The starting quarterback appeared in only four games all season; Each of the two leading rushers missed significant portions of the season due to injury; And before the year even began, a receiver and tight end—both of whom were seniors expected to have productive seasons—were sidelined for the campaign.
A key reason that Harvard’s 10-0 record was at all a possibility given the fluctuation in last year’s attack was the offensive line. No matter who was under center or in the backfield, the 2014 O-line consistently created wide running lanes and protected passing pockets. Largely due to its efforts, the Crimson ended with the second-most prolific offense in the Ancient Eight behind Yale—a team that started a Clemson transfer at quarterback and a running back now suiting up for the Indianapolis Colts.
“It was certainly one of the best [offensive lines] we’ve ever had,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
Anchored by then-senior center Nick Easton ’15, the Crimson was second in the FCS in tackles for loss allowed (behind only FCS national champion North Dakota State) tied for second in the Ancient Eight with 5.5 yards per rush, and allowed just 11 sacks on the year.
Harvard may have graduated left guard Michael Mancinelli ’15 and lost Easton to the San Francisco 49ers, but the 2015 edition of the line will still feature seniors Adam Redmond, Cole Toner, and Anthony Fabiano, all three-year starters. The continuity of the unit’s prowess and wealth of experience was on display last Saturday in the tilt with Rhode Island, when Crimson quarterback Scott Hosch had a career passing day under ample protection from the line, throwing for 336 yards and three scores.
“We’re confident playing together,” Redmond said. “We know what we’re doing on every play. I know where the guy next to me is going to be, he knows where I’m going to be, and that just makes us work as one unit every play, and that makes the job easy.”
Joining Redmond, Toner, and Fabiano are junior right tackle Max Rich and sophomore right guard Larry Allen Jr., both of whom have had limited game-time experience.
Though Rich and Allen Jr. have big shoes to fill, the stability of a group over the last few years that has enabled rushers Treavor Scales ’13 and senior Paul Stanton to notch their places in the Harvard record books predicts another productive offensive line, something Murphy attributes to recruiting practices.
“We want guys that are really tough and competitive,” Murphy said. “It isn’t good enough to be a great athlete, a big guy, if you’re really not a tough guy because it’s one of those jobs that to take pride in it, there’s no real sense of glory…. You have to have that mentality that I’m going to work every day not expecting a big paycheck. But I really enjoy what I do.”
Redmond, Toner, and Fabiano may never score a touchdown, and they may never feature prominently—if at all—in a box score. But for these three seniors, the payoff isn’t in the individual glory. It comes through the unit—“tied together like elephants on a string,” as Murphy puts it—paving the way for the guys around them to move the ball down the field.
“When the offense succeeds, we succeed, so we take pride in all of that on the field,” Redmond said. “We have a lot of fun out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard football team has a target on its back.
Winning three out of the past four Ivy League championships will do that to you. So will notching an undefeated season in 2014. And so will winning 15 straight games, finishing no lower than third in the Ancient Eight since 2001, and being picked to end up at the top of the conference once more this season.
When opponents look across the ball and see Crimson helmets staring back, a new level of intensity emerges. It is no understatement to say that, for nearly every team in the Ivy League, Harvard is the game circled in red on the schedule.
“Who is Princeton’s biggest rival? It’s really us,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Who is Dartmouth’s biggest rival? It’s really us. Who is Brown’s biggest rival? It’s really us. Who is Penn’s biggest rival? It’s really us. You get that every single week. So if you have any hint of sort of looking past a team in our league, you’re dead, because we are everybody’s big game.”
Add the fact that there are no playoffs or postseason games in the Ancient Eight, and every contest suddenly has the potential to be season-defining. With only seven conference games, one loss can be decisive—so you’d better focus on the matchup right in front of you.
That’s the philosophy the 2014 Crimson embraced, when the team’s unblemished final record masked the adversity it faced throughout the campaign. Midway through the season, Harvard managed to outlast a feisty Dartmouth squad in a dogfight. The team needed a furious fourth-quarter comeback to hold off Penn. And it took a 35-yard touchdown pass in the waning moments of The Game for the Crimson to top Yale.
Things won’t get any easier for Harvard in 2015. Both the Big Green and the Bulldogs will likely be improved. Yale returns quarterback Morgan Roberts at the helm of an attack that ranked first in the conference last year in scoring, rushing, and passing offense. Meanwhile, according to the football blog College Sports Madness, Dartmouth boasts both the projected Offensive and Defensive Ivy League Players of the Year in quarterback Dalyn Williams and linebacker Will McNamara.
In years past, the road to an Ivy League championship for the Crimson has often gone through Princeton. But this season, in addition to what will inevitably be a high-stakes showdown with Yale, the biggest game may come under the lights at Harvard Stadium against Dartmouth in week seven.
“If they stay healthy, [these] will probably be the best Dartmouth and the best Yale teams we’ve seen in at least the last 15 years,” Murphy said.
Only time will tell if Harvard is up to the task, but the program can approach the season confidently due to the return of a host of experienced faces on both sides of the ball. Senior quarterback Scott Hosch, who led the Crimson to six victories in 2014, had the best statistical game of his career in a season-opening 41-10 win against Rhode Island, throwing for 336 yards and three touchdowns.
“[Hosch] is a more polished, confident, and productive quarterback than he was a year ago, to the point where I’m going to go out on a limb and say there’s no question in my mind that he’ll be one of the top offensive players in the Ivy League,” Murphy said.
The offense boasts a number of additional threats who will help Hosch light up the scoreboard. Running back Paul Stanton and wide receiver Andrew Fischer are established seniors and are coming off first- and second-team All-Ivy seasons, respectively. Senior wide receiver Seitu Smith II, along with tight ends senior Ben Braunecker and junior Anthony Firkser, add needed depth to the aerial assault.
While the offense has the potential to be explosive, the defense seems equipped to be stifling. It all starts with a senior linebacker corps of captain Matt Koran, Eric Medes, and Jacob Lindsey, which Murphy says may be as good a trio as he’s ever had at Harvard in terms of leadership and production.
Apart from a defensive line that lost the significant talents of Zack Hodges ’15 and Obum Obukwelu ’15, there is continuity at nearly every other position. That can only mean good things, given that the 2014 Crimson ranked first in the FCS in terms of scoring defense, surrendering just 12.3 points per game.
“We basically set the standard for ourselves [last year], and we won’t stop until we become the number one defense in the FCS,” said senior defensive end James Duberg.
“If the offense turns the ball over on their own 20-yard line, the defense needs to go in and hold them to either a field goal or get a turnover,” Koran added. “I think that was a big thing for us last year.”
You can’t improve on perfection. That’s why both Harvard players and coaches have repeatedly emphasized that this is a new season, a new team. And with a new year come different challenges. The 2015 Crimson will need to develop its own identity, and it will need to do so quickly—because each week, the next opponent will be looking to knock Harvard off its throne.
“It’s going to be an extremely competitive league, more so than ever,” Murphy said. “You put it all together, and you just better concentrate on having a good day, because everybody’s good. You can’t take anyone lightly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The last time that Harvard football competed on its home field, the date was November 22, 2014. The opponent was Yale. The result was historic.
Those memories may still linger—but not for much longer.
This Saturday in Cambridge, the Crimson (1-0) will finally fill Harvard Stadium with a new set of sights and sounds when it faces off against Brown (0-1) in both teams’ league opener.
At the 7 p.m. kickoff Harvard will consign the last remnants of 2014 to the past, but what will remain are lofty expectations and loftier goals—in particular the goal of winning a third consecutive Ancient Eight title. No Crimson squad has ever achieved that feat.
“We won the last two, se we have a target on our backs,” said junior wide receiver Joseph Foster. “People know that. We have to come out motivated and hungry, ready to get after it again.”
The first obstacle to three-peat excellence is a deep Bears squad that returns a slew of crucial starters from last year’s 5-5 finish.
Perhaps the most crucial is quarterback Marcus Fuller. A fifth-year senior, Fuller successfully petitioned to earn an extra year of eligibility after a junior-year injury condemned him to watching from the bench.
After that year of inactivity, Fuller exploded onto the scene during the 2014 campaign. He racked up 2,618 yards and 15 touchdowns, good for third in the Ivy League in both categories.
“A year later, he’s a much more polished quarterback,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “The ball’s going to be in the air a lot on Saturday night.”
To complement Fuller, Brown returns running backs Andrew Coke and Seth Rosenbauer, a pair of juniors who saw significant game action last year.
Still the Bears show signs of being a pass-first offense. In the first game of the 2015 season, Fuller threw 403 yards on a whopping 52 attempts.
That effort wasn’t enough to prevent a slouching effort from Brown, which lost to Bryant, 20-16, at home.
Last Saturday, the Bears committed four turnovers in the red zone, including a backbreaking interception in the end zone in the final minute. Fuller threw another interception in the first quarter, and Brown lost three fumbles, two of which came in the red zone.
“They tend to be the team that, at times, looks dysfunctional in their opener,” Murphy said. “But when they show up for their game against Harvard, they look like the Patriots.”
Indeed, in last year’s matchup, the Crimson went down 14-6 midway through the third quarter before rallying for three straight scores and a 22-14 win. That was the closest margin of victory for Harvard all season, aside from a 31-24 triumph in The Game.
In 2014 the Brown contest marked the first start in Scott Hosch’s career; in 2015 he enters the matchup one weekend after putting up career bests with 336 passing yards and three touchdowns. Propelled by that performance, the Crimson beat Rhode Island, 41-10.
If Hosch wants a repeat performance, then he will have to overcome Brown’s defensive line, a group that returns over 100 tackles of talent. Defensive captain Zach Sparber, a second super-senior, will lead that unit.
The Bears’ defensive line is experienced but also aggressive, and the Crimson has spent much of the week preparing for the inevitable waves of blitzes.
“Last week they blitzed the majority of the time,” said junior running back Paul Stanton. “I know I’m going to have to step up my blocking game a lot this week.”
That said, Stanton will also be doing a fair bit of running. In 2014 he turned in 990 rushing yards, second most among Ancient Eight running backs.
The Crimson could use a continuation of this productivity today against the team that Murphy says has declared the returning champions its “biggest rival.”
“When a team says you’re the biggest rival, you know that it’s going to be a tremendously tough, competitive game,” Murphy said. “Our biggest rival is our next game, whoever it is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­BOSTON—After falling behind on a goal late in the first half, the Harvard men’s soccer team came out of the break with a new sense of urgency. They strung together more meaningful passes in the midfield. They pressed farther into the final third. And as they earned a corner after a deflected cross in the 54th minute, the equalizing goal seemed only moments away.
Just a few seconds later, however, the Crimson players found themselves scratching their heads. “2-0,” the scoreboard read here at Boston University’s Nickerson Field.
The hill that they needed to climb was now a mountain.
Anthony Viteri, the Terriers’ star sophomore midfielder, had just scored his second goal of the game. Harvard was caught out on the counterattack after committing too many players to their corner kick, and paid dearly when Viteri calmly slotted home a 1-on-0 with Crimson co-captain and goalkeeper Evan Mendez.
The sequence leading to this second goal basically summed up the game as Harvard (1-4-2) went on to lose 3-0 to BU (4-2-0). The Crimson created multiple scoring opportunities, especially in the second half, but failed to capitalize on any of them.
Its opposition, on the other hand, saw less of the ball but scored on two picture-perfect counterattacks.
“[Counterattacks are] something we haven’t really given up,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We’ll look at that and sort that through.”
On the defensive side of the ball for BU, junior goalkeeper Matt Gilbert, a second-year starter, played the leading role in the shutout. In one of the highlights of the game, he tipped a blazing shot over the bar with one hand in the 85th minute. At that point, Harvard was still clawing to get back in the game.
After the save, however, the wheels fell off the bus for the Crimson.
In one last counterattack, BU’s senior forward Lucas McBride finished a breakaway with a simple flick over Mendez. One Harvard defender pedaled back to oppose McBride on the play, but a precise pass from midfield, coupled with McBride’s speed, rendered him helpless.
The Crimson’s poor finishing was also at fault for its blowout loss. Several players, including senior midfielder Tim Schmoll, had great opportunities to get Harvard on the scoreboard, but could not find the back of the net.
Senior forward Michael Innocenzi saw a good chance go to waste in the 80th minute when he couldn’t quite handle a pass just outside of the box and a BU defender recovered to kick the ball away.
Throughout the game, Lehrer used most of his substitutions to try to find the right combination of players to spear his offense. Yet no combination broke through as the Crimson failed to score for a third game in a row.
“It’s frustrating for everybody,” Lehrer said. “It’s a very good group, but we just haven’t gotten it right yet.”
Harvard’s last goal came on September 13 in the 81st minute of a 2-1 win at Stony Brook. Not counting stoppage time, Harvard’s scoreless streak now extends 298 minutes.
Watching from the sideline, injured Crimson co-captain Mark Ashby appreciated his team’s effort and was impressed by BU’s bruising style.
“I thought we competed really well. They were really physical, but our players put it all out there on the field. We’ll be ready [for next week],” Ashby said.
After being sidelined with a quad injury for the entire start of the season, Ashby also expressed optimism that he will return to the lineup soon. Gaining back the reigning Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year will serve as a confidence boost for a Crimson defense that has struggled to shut down the opposing attack.
While Harvard was unable to come out with the victory, the team now turns its attention to Ancient Eight play. With its opening matchup against Yale looming in the distance, the ultimate goal remains the same for the Crimson.
“We have a great core of guys,” Ashby said. “So far the results haven’t shown that, but our goal is still to win the Ivy League. “
