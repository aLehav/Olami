After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Welcome everyone, just a reminder, our class today will be off the record.”
“Good morning, welcome to this invite-only breakfast, this event will be off the record.”
“Today’s private forum will be off the record.”
“This lunch is off the record.”
“This dinner is off the record.”
Off the record, off the record, off the record. Sean Spicer was publicly offered a Visiting Fellowship here at the Harvard Kennedy School—and then allowed to speak entirely off the record.
During his time on campus, Spicer had closed-door forums with select faculty and fellows, spoke in a few chosen classes, and attended invite-only meals with selected groups of students. In total, 11 events over three days, all off the record, none open to the general student body or public. Not a single word Sean Spicer spoke during his Visiting Fellowship at Harvard was on the record, nor could a single word could be heard without an explicit invite.
This was Sean Spicer’s secret Harvard fellowship. All of us should push the School to not allow this level of secrecy for a Fellow again.
In his memo to the student body rescinding the Visiting Fellowship of Chelsea Manning, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf defended inviting provocative speakers like Spicer to campus, saying, “We do not shy away from that controversy, we insist that all speakers take questions, and these questions are often hard and challenging ones. Hearing a very wide range of views, regardless of what members of our community think about the people offering those views, is fundamental to the learning process at the Kennedy School.”
Why then did Harvard shy away from controversy while Spicer was here on campus? When given the opportunity to have an open dialogue with a controversial figure, the School chose to secretly shuttle Sean Spicer from restricted event to restricted event.  What lessons does this teach future leaders and policymakers about accountability and transparency? And was this secretive policy even successful in allowing Spicer to be more candid?
I was in a classroom session with Spicer and he told the same stories, including several easily refutable lies, that he’s told publicly since leaving the White House (some items were leaked). The classroom session followed the same playbook as his Press Secretary tenure: Dodge hard questions, make a few false statements, attack the media, claim that Trump is treated unfairly, etc. The off the record policy did not make him particularly candid.
The School’s desire to have tight control when a controversial speaker visits the campus makes sense: It’s easier for both the School and the guest. Harvard didn’t have to deal with protestors or worry about negative media attention. Sean Spicer, likewise, didn’t have to worry about being factual in his remarks or confronted with difficult questions. This tight control creates a low risk environment for both stakeholders.
But this low risk environment is also low reward for the community. First, most students didn’t get the chance to hear Sean Spicer out, let alone ask him questions. Second, Spicer’s comments in these meetings aren’t available to fact check and challenge publicly, leaving tweets like this as the final public record. I understand that it’s uncomfortable to invite someone to campus and then have students publicly challenge that person’s actions. However, constructive civil discourse isn’t comfortable and easy; it’s awkward and challenging. Unfortunately, Harvard valued the comfort of itself and its guest more than it valued providing a learning opportunity for its students.
The next controversial Visiting Fellow to grace Harvard’s campus is Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager who physically assaulted a female reporter on the campaign trail. Additionally, according to The New Yorker, “On his first CNN appearance, on June 25th, Lewandowski would neither confirm nor deny having signed a ‘non-disparagement’ agreement of the kind other former Trump employees have,” which calls into question the potential level of his candor and the value of his visit. Students haven’t been notified yet about when he will be here, let alone what opportunities there will be to engage with him. It seems that Harvard plans to give Lewandowski the same secret treatment they gave Sean Spicer.
Students deserve better from Harvard. For Lewandowski’s visit, and any other Fellows in the future, public appearances should be required. If Dean Elmendorf states that civil discourse is “fundamental to the learning process at the Kennedy School,” then the School should let the student body take part in that process, out in the open and on the record.
Let’s put an end to secret Harvard fellowships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Albert Einstein received a message from a bellboy at Tokyo’s Imperial Hotel, the great theoretical physicist, who was traveling in Japan for a 1922 lecture tour, reached for a tip—and found his pockets empty. Improvising, Einstein grabbed a scrap of hotel stationery, scribbled a short note in German, and gave it to the bellboy. “A calm and modest life,” the tip read, “brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness.”
As new policies relativize Harvard space and Harvard Time—with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s move to Allston in 2020 and the new class schedule slated for next fall—students protesting these changes could use this tip from the man who first coined the idea of space-time in 1905.
Harvard’s current timetable, now largely made of back-to-back hour-long classes, will change next fall to four blocks of 75 minute class periods with three 15 minute passing periods between each block. Longer labs and seminars will have meeting periods at designated times during the day. The upshot: The class time required by a normal minimum course load (four classes meeting three times per week) will increase from 12 hours to 17 hours and 15 minutes—three hours of added class time, two hours and 15 minutes of passing periods.
Left out of these revisions, of course, is the College’s unofficial seven minute time dilation between classes—affectionately known as Harvard time. As members of the Harvard habitus quickly learn, every class, social event, or extracurricular club meeting begins seven minutes after the scheduled start time, giving students with color-blocked Google calendars time to travel from one seamlessly scheduled event to the next. Harvard time is a storied tradition and a way of undergraduate life. (It’s even a YouTube channel.) And it’s not going down without a fight.
Crusades to rescue Harvard Time from the administration’s new schedule have ranged from Google Form petitions, to plaintive editorial laments, to fiery statistics-spewing op-eds. The arguments are compelling—not so much for their persuasive force, but for their wholesale devotion to “constant restlessness” over any pause in the Harvard schedule. But Einstein would disagree with most of these protestors. As his tip to the bellboy makes clear, we shouldn’t underestimate the power of passing periods.
The most serious arguments against the new schedule, leveraged in the key terms of Economics 10, claim that the current schedule maximizes efficiency and minimizes the opportunity cost of idle passing periods. They charge that the modified timetable is only efficient for the minority of students commuting from Cambridge to Allston, and otherwise wastes 22 years of student time—and encroaches on meetings for extracurricular organizations.
But what do we mean by efficiency? To many Harvard undergraduates, efficiency means back-to-back-to-back commitments squeezing every last ounce of overextended activity into the daily to-do list. We don’t seem to mind that seven minutes of class time are lost in the logistical maelstrom. We want lectures, sections, lunch dates, practices, and club meetings to run bumper to bumper, so our schedules will be as “efficient” as commitment traffic jams.
But is that why we came to Harvard? We talk about the opportunity cost of extending classes and adding 15 minutes of passing time in between, but what about the opportunity cost of spending four years at a top university, too busy to take full advantage of its intellectual resources?
We become so obsessed by “constant restlessness” that we forget the critical value of passing periods. Moments of reflection—of in-between, unoccupied time—give us the space to digest ideas, chew on questions, strike up conversations, and reflect on what we’ve learned. If we’re too busy always dashing from one contiguous lecture to the next, we’re too preoccupied to let the last sweet notes of a thought, presentation, or discussion hang in the air.
Practically speaking, the new schedule gives us room to do this. The extra minutes before and after class, as well as the time leftover from lectures that don’t take the entire 75 minute block, are opportunities for fascinating conversations and lively debates. The “wasted” minutes in between classes can help us maximize and internalize what we learned during those classes.
The importance of passing periods, of course, isn’t limited to the time between class blocks. The sound-bite “transformative experience” may have become a penniless platitude, but it’s still, fundamentally, what we’re after in our undergraduate careers. But when was the last time a midterm paper or problem set was a transformative experience instead of a box to check before moving on to the next pressing thing? When was the last time we so internalized a lecture, idea, or conversation that it changed the way we think about the world?
Being busy isn’t bad, but relentless occupation with too many things keeps us from having the space and time to make the most of those things that we’re truly passionate about. Constant restlessness is anything but efficient. Transformation requires reflection, which is something an overpacked schedule running on Harvard time can’t give us.
With his special and general theories of relativity, Einstein changed the way we think about space and time. With his note to the bellboy from the Imperial Hotel, he should change the way we think about those same two media in the context of intellectual growth. We need a new system of mechanics if we’re to make the most of our Harvard education. We need both space on our calendars and time between commitments for the thoughtful reflection necessary to really learn. We need rest from constant restlessness to take full advantage of our intellectual opportunities. It’s time we took a tip from Einstein.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, suffice it to say, have it real tough. Our favorite eateries close down weekly. Rare diseases spread across campus. Professors demand class attendance. And, until last week, we had to wait in line before leaving Lamont Library, facing the dreaded bag-checker, indiscriminate in its resolve to ensure that we didn’t steal books that are free to check out anyway. Quelle horreur.
But at last, a ray of hope has shined down on our lives: The removal of the bag checker station. No longer must we suffer the indignity of opening both our laptop case and every single pocket on our backpack—even the small one where we keep our gum or phone charger.
In all seriousness, the bag checking was a minor inconvenience. And yet, we feel overwhelming joy that we can now walk out the doors of Lamont without the little added stress that came with that book check, a check that felt eternal when running late. Although there are concerns of book thefts rising, we hope the Lamont powers that be are able to institute and maintain appropriate anti-book smuggling procedures.
We are glad to see a tangible link between what the student body wants and what the administration is willing to do—especially in a space so commonly tied to gloom, tears, memories of staying up until 4 a.m. writing Government 20: “Foundations of Comparative Politics” papers and the pseudo-productive atmosphere of Lamont Cafe. While this policy change may seem insignificant, we hope it speaks well to the future of communication between students and the administration.
We would be remiss not to praise the other benefits Lamont announced as well: upgraded, high-speed WiFi throughout the building, new water stations, and the addition of more moveable whiteboards. We appreciate these changes, as they have turned a previously soulless building into one marginally more tolerable.
These recent changes to Harvard’s libraries have made them much more open to students. They may have achieved the impossible: making Lamont a space students might actually want to go to. We hope this upward trend of positivity and added benefits continues, making once-feared places across campus like Lamont more friendly.

UPDATED: November 2, 2017 at 10: 58 p.m.
Market in the Square, a popular 24 hour deli frequented by students, abruptly shuttered Thursday morning after the Middlesex County Sheriff’s Department seized the property.
The seizure was a result of the deli’s failure to pay rent, according to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, of which Market was a member.
Officers posted orange “SEIZED” signs and covered the building’s windows. Police from the Middlesex Sheriff’s Department presented a court order to seize the property Thursday morning, taking ownership of all items and assets on the premises.
Elizabeth Y. Lint, executive director of the Cambridge License Commission, said the commission granted a new tenant a license to open at 60 Church St., the former location of Market.
In mid-October, Hello Fresh applied for a license to serve and prepare food at the Church St. property. According to their license application, they plan to stay open 24 hours a day and house seating for 20 people.
“This will be the same continuing operation that was previously there as a market, and there’s going to be very little change in the premises,” attorney Sean D. Hope said at a licence commission meeting yesterday. “A sheriff has been retained and they will be seizing possession of the premises.”
Hello Fresh operates under parent company Wholesome Fresh MA, and will be opening soon as a “very similar operation” to Market, Jillson said. Jillson added that Market’s nonpayment of rents had been happening for quite some time.
“These things don’t happen overnight,” Jillson said. “It was a while that they did not pay rent. I know for sure that the property owner tried to keep the operation going to make sure that the employees stayed there and that the building stayed open because that’s important for the Square, not to have something shuttered. He kept in open in spite of the fact of not collecting rent, so he could have time to find a suitable operator.”
Trinity Property Management,a real estate firm that manages the Market building, declined to comment. Market Manager Peter Whang, a Tufts graduate with several grocery stores in Connecticut, could not be reached for comment.
Kevin Maccioli, Public Information Officer at the Middlesex Sheriff’s Department, wrote in an emailed statement that “the action was pursuant to a court order,” but was unable to provide any further information.
Rigoberto “Rigo” Marcus-Perez, a night-shift cashier at Market, said in a Facebook message that he has “no clue what’s going on” and had been trying to contact his boss to find out more. He also commented “RIP TO ME” in a Facebook meme group frequented by Harvard undergraduates.
Casey R. Goggin ’19 posted the meme immediately after he noticed the sign on Market’s window. In an interview, Goggin said he was headed to Market to pick up his weekly kombucha tea and Haribo peaches candy.
“My reaction was intense shock and then anger at the carceral state specifically, and then confusion and sadness all mixed together to make their own combined emotion,” he said. “I do this every Thursday morning and that cycle was disrupted today.”
Nine hours after posting the meme, Goggin’s post had nearly 700 likes. “I wasn’t surprised at all,” Goggin said. “I expected the community to come out and I was overjoyed to see their care be shown on the meme.”
Many Harvard students said they will remember Market for its sandwiches and employees. They hope that Hello Fresh will bear some similarities to the former tenant.
“I think part of it is definitely the guys that work behind the deli there. If they’re still there, I’ll still go. I think that gave it a lot of the character,” Brandon N. Wachs ’18, who frequented Market about once a week, said. “It definitely leaves a hole for a good place to get a sandwich.”
Jin Park ’18 said that the closure was “devastating.”
“The people who worked there were amazing. I was really close to them,” Park said. “They’re homies.”
Goggin agreed, saying that Market was one of “the most inclusive spaces left on this campus.”
“I think Market is a place that takes care of everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, or what state they’re in at 3 a.m. when they go there for a sandwich,” he added.
Though the closure of the deli was shocking to many, some customers said they could also see indications of financial trouble.
“It’s definitely surprising that they would be forced to close down. Although at the same time, you could tell in the way that their inventory had changed that maybe they were in a little bit of trouble,” Wachs said.
While in business, Market also provided occasional donations to local homeless shelters. According to Kevin E. Eappen ’20, Food and In-Kind Donations Director at Y2Y, the shelter may see an impact in the variety of food that it provides, but most likely will not see much change in the amount of food available.
“We’re just looking forward to a similar relationship with [Hello Fresh],” Eappen said.

Students hoping to travel the world had to first travel across the University’s campuses for “Where in the World is Harvard?” contest, which offered two international travel fellowships as its grand prizes.
Part of Harvard’s first-ever Worldwide Week, the contest invited students to identify where a series of travel photographs—placed around Harvard’s buildings in Cambridge, Allston, and Boston—were taken. At stake: a fully-funded summer international travel fellowship for one undergraduate student and a $2,000 fellowship for one graduate student, plus a selection of Square business gift cards for the runners-up.
“We wanted to think of ways to get people excited about Worldwide Week, so we thought the contest might create some excitement and buzz for students,” said Todd Washburn, senior assistant provost for international affairs.
While no winners have been chosen yet, the odds are good: just 10 graduate and 25 College students submitted entries, according to the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs. Winners of the contest will have until early February to arrange details of their study abroad program, internship, or public service opportunity and submit a written plan for review.
The photographs were displayed through Wednesday at locations on campus including Lamont Library and the Semitic Museum, as well as at the i-Lab in Allston and a School of Public Health building in Boston.
“We purposefully placed the photos in locations that people may not normally visit because one of the themes of global work and international travel is forcing yourself outside your comfort zone and that can be a really enriching, growing experience,” Washburn said.
Camila Nardozzi, director for the Office of International Education, said the OIE helped to curate photos for the travel contest using images Harvard students had taken during summer study abroad programs.
“Our students who went abroad in the past had already taken these photos, so our office thought it would be great to showcase some of them around campus through this contest,” Nardozzi said.
Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, said he hopes to see more students engaging in meaningful study abroad experiences, whether through summer schools, volunteer work, internships, or research.
“I firmly believe that even two weeks abroad, if the program or the experience is structured thoughtfully, is plenty to get somebody a meaningful experience,” Elliott said. “To be in a foreign environment where you don’t understand everything that’s going on and the cars are coming at you from the wrong direction can be disorienting. It’s good to be disoriented.”

Harvard will hold a memorial service Nov. 8 to honor Alexander H. Patel ’17-'18, a Harvard senior who died in late October in a loss “felt deeply” by students and professors, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to students Thursday.
The service will take place in Memorial Church Sanctuary, and will be followed by a reception in Adams House, Khurana wrote in his email.
“Many of us knew Alexander as a brilliant and supportive classmate, and as a true friend,” Khurana wrote. “Both the service and the reception will provide the opportunity for those in our community whose lives were touched by Alexander to come together.”
Patel, a Philosophy and Mathematics concentrator and award-winning former Crimson News editor, passed away unexpectedly at age 22. The Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner found that Patel, an Adams House affiliate who lived off campus, died by suicide, according to spokesperson Felix Browne.
Patel attended high school in Denver, Colo. before coming to Harvard. On campus, he worked as a teaching fellow for various Computer Science classes, conducted research in a lab run by Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83, and held a side-job as an information technology consultant.
He also wrote for The Crimson, covering Harvard Business School and serving on the paper’s data analysis team. A data-based 2015 story on faculty political donations Patel helped report earned him a national award.
Peers and professors remembered Patel as a brilliant student and devoted friend and family member: someone who drove his sister to school every day in high school, someone willing to debug friends’ code at 3 a.m.
“He was an unbelievable friend, and he never hesitated to bring me into his life or to be generous with his time,” said Christopher P. Barry, one of Patel’s high school friends. “He was one of the best people I ever knew. He deserves to be remembered as such.”

More than a dozen handmade stickers reading “It’s okay to be white” surfaced around Harvard Square Wednesday, prompting Cambridge officials to remove them and a Harvard Law School Dean to denounce the signs as “provocations intended to divide us.”
The stickers appeared to be part of a campaign started on the forum website 4chan, which called upon followers to put up posters with the message in their area on Halloween night.  The author of the original post on the site wrote that they hoped the “credibility of far left campuses and media gets nuked” as a result of the incident, adding that they could help achieve a “massive victory for the right in the culture war.”
Similar stickers were spotted in a handful of places around the country Wednesday morning.
“It seems likely that these anonymous postings, made in the middle of the night, were provocations intended to divide us from one another,” Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells wrote in an email sent to Law students Wednesday after the stickers were spotted at Wasserstein and Hastings Halls.
“HLS will not let that happen here. We live, work, teach, and learn together in a community that is stronger, better, and deeper because of our diversity and because we encourage open, respectful, and constructive discourse,” Sells wrote.
In 2015, a vandalism incident featuring pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black professors at the Law School spurred a broader campus dialogue about race on campus.
Most of the stickers appeared to have been removed by Wednesday afternoon.
When alerted about the stickers, Cambridge Police asked the Department of Public Works to remove them from Cambridge Common and Harvard Square, Cambridge police spokesman Jeremy Warnick told the Boston Globe.
Sells confirmed in her email to students Wednesday afternoon that the stickers at the Law School had already been removed.
This is not the first public posting suggesting the plight of white people in the United States at Harvard.  In October 2016,  an email with the subject line “Fight White Genocide - Vote Trump!” was sent to some undergraduates, prompting Harvard to call upon police to investigate.  In November 2015, a Facebook page and posters on campus advertised a “White Student Union” at Harvard.

Freshmen making their way to Annenberg on Wednesday morning passed by a mountain of trash including greasy pizza boxes, rotting food, and crumpled red cups—a pile of the waste those living in the Yard produced in a single day.
Harvard’s Office for Sustainability built the eye-and nose-catching pile, dubbed “Mt. Trashmore,” to coincide its annual waste audit. On Wednesday, student representatives of the office’s Resource Efficiency Program shared recycling and sustainability tips with passerby, encouraging them to take photos—complete with a custom Snapchat filter—with the trash heap.
William C. Belfiore ’19, an inactive Crimson News editor and Sustainability “REP,” said that the event was designed to raise awareness about waste.
“The purpose of the event is just to give students a physical, visual example of what the trash they throw away looks like,” Belfiore said.
At least one freshman, though, was unmoved. Emma V. Stimpfl ’21, who said she recycles but does not compost, said she thought the pile would have been bigger.
“I was not surprised,” she said. “I thought it would be more.”
As part of the waste audit, the REPs also weighed a sample of Harvard’s trash and recycling to determine the amount of waste that was put in the wrong bin, finding that 28 percent of the “trash” was actually recyclable—an improvement from last year. On the other hand, the REPs found that nearly a quarter of items in recycling bins should have just been thrown out.
REP captain Isabelle Desisto ’20 said that one of the main focuses of the event this year is to get people to break down the cardboard boxes they recycle. Often, students will throw away materials that should be recycled because the recycling bins are full of bulky boxes, she said.
“I think the coolest thing I saw was that this same trash can could fit 25 folded boxes, and just five unfolded boxes,” Ethan Taotafa ’21, who passed by the event, said.
Belfiore said that people involved in sustainability efforts on campus are often frustrated by the lack of recycling on campus, adding that students should at least remember to recycle their red cups and pizza boxes.
“Harvard students are so smart, so driven, and often understand the importance of civic values,” Belfiore said. “But really simple things like composting or recycling, throwing things into the right trashcan, Harvard students don’t do, or put a lot of thought into.”

The assessed value of property in Harvard Square nearly doubled between fiscal years 2012 and 2017, an explosive growth that has contributed to rising rising rents and high turnover among Square businesses.
According to data collected by the City of Cambridge, assessed property values in Harvard Square rose from $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2012 to $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2017. And as property values rise, so do rent rates, according to Michael H. Shuman, an expert on community economics, a trend he said poses problems for local retailers.
“That increases the demand for property and that increases the rents,” Shuman said.
Though the City of Cambridge does not publish data about rent rates paid by tenants, the rise in appraised property values provides a window into the economic forces reshaping Harvard Square. High foot traffic, as well as proximity to Harvard and public transportation, have driven property values skyward.
“It’s having a big impact on small and independent businesses that are already struggling to compete in the market that has a lot of incursion by online shopping,” Cambridge City Councillor Jan Devereux  said. “It’s a problem.”
In the last several months, a string of Square businesses have shuttered or relocated. Family-run newsstand Crimson Corner moved several blocks after 54 years at the heart of Harvard Square, the Quad-adjacent University Wine Shop plans to move later this month after 30 years in business, and Schoenhof’s Foreign Books, Wagamama, and Kaju Tofu House have all shuttered within the past year.
Paul DeRuzzo, who owns the University Wine Shop, said that an increase in rent during recent lease negotiations with his property owner prompted his plan to move the store.

“The rent they were asking for was too high and we went back and forth numerous times and it didn’t look like they were going to agree,” DeRuzzo said. “They didn’t agree to lowering the rent until we were going to move.”
DeRuzzo added that he thinks rents in Harvard Square, a brief distance from his store’s location on Mass. Ave., are “absolutely ridiculous.”
“I don’t know how any business can sustain that rent,” DeRuzzo said. “All the people in these neighborhoods are afraid that what happened in Harvard Square is going to happen here, and the rest of the way down the Ave. There’s going to be no small businesses.”
Crimson Corner recently relocated from the corner of Mass. Ave. and JFK St. to 35 Brattle St., partially due to rent increases. Owner Chris Kotelly said that he has seen rises in rents recently.
“Within the last three to five years there’s been a dramatic increase, and I feel that part of that is because the property values of these buildings have gone up dramatically,” Kotelly said. “I think at some point the rents probably would—I hope would—level off, because it’s just not sustainable.”
Crimson Corner’s previous location is currently vacant, joining vacancies at Wagamama’s previous venue on the first floor of 57 JFK St.’s Crimson Galeria, Kaju Tofu House’s location on the property’s second floor, and CVS’s prior location at 1426 Mass. Ave.
Daniel Eastman, the general director of Schoenhof’s Foreign Books, said the data on increasing property values “does not surprise” him. The foreign language bookstore had occupied its Mount Auburn St. storefront since 1983.
“One can see the dynamics that could create those figures,” Eastman said. “Definitely for small businesses, retail, I don’t see too much diversity possible with the prices.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that while the situation could be better, the Square is “healthy”—not overwhelmed by vacancies—and the rents are suitable for the location.
“The truth is that we’re at 95 percent occupied here in Harvard Square,” Jillson said. “I would say that rents are competitive, I think that they’re probably appropriately priced for this particular location. I think the foot traffic that we have here in Harvard Square is incredibly important.”
Still, Michael Kanter—a leader of small business advocacy group Cambridge Local First and an owner of Cambridge Naturals, a natural health store in Porter Square, said rents in Harvard Square are particularly high.
“I think it’s kind of the place to be seen in the area. A lot of businesses don’t really care what they’re paying if they’re big chains, they just want to have a presence there,” Kanter added. “I think that developers see that as a great opportunity. Harvard Square is still iconic, no question about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 defended the Harvard’s decision to appeal a National Labor Relations Board ruling in an email sent to students Thursday, arguing that Harvard facilitated a fair unionization election last fall.
Harvard’s appeal, filed in August, challenges a previous NLRB ruling that said there should be a new unionization election because the list of eligible voters generated by Harvard before the initial Nov. 2016 vote was inadequate. The provisional tally after that election showed more voters opposed Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers than supported it.
With this appeal, Harvard seeks a ruling from the federal NLRB, a five-person board of presidential appointees that decides labor disputes. Some legal experts have speculated that the board’s now-Republican majority could side with Harvard and rule against another election.
In his email, Garber argued that Harvard’s voter list was accurate and complete.
“The University’s goal was always to include all eligible voters on the list,” he wrote. “A University team worked diligently to create the most accurate list possible despite challenging conditions: a University-wide bargaining unit; a tight deadline set by the HGSU-UAW and the NLRB; and information systems that were not designed for this purpose.”
Garber also argued that high voter turnout in the Nov. 2016 unionization election indicated that students were well-informed about the vote.
“Paid and volunteer organizers for the HGSU-UAW had unfettered access to students across our physical campus and through e-mail, social media, and other communications channels for some 18 months,” he wrote. “Students were well-informed, voted in large numbers, and, according to the initial vote count, voted against forming a union.”
Garber’s unionization message drew sharp criticism from union organizers.
Andy Donnelly, a union organizer and graduate student, argued that Garber’s reference to “a tight deadline set by the HGSU-UAW and the NLRB” is misleading, citing the fact that both Harvard and the unionization effort signed an election agreement in Oct. 2016 set the date of the election.
FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven and GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall declined to respond to Donnelly’s comments.
Donnelly also argued that the University’s appeal runs contrary to current labor law, which states that employers have to generate an adequate voter list—a responsibility which, according to him, Harvard did not fulfill.
“Since they can't win on the facts, Harvard’s trying to change the law,” Donnelly said.
Harvard administrators disagree.
“The University believes strongly that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of the majority of eligible voters, should stand,” Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an August email to students announcing Harvard’s intent to appeal.
Garber’s message comes six days before a rally that HGSU-UAW plans to hold to protest Harvard’s decision to appeal.
The federal NLRB, like the Supreme Court, does not rule on every case before it—the board could choose not to take Harvard’s case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-two.
That’s how many seasons the Harvard men’s hockey team has played in its current home rink, now named the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The only exception came in the 1978-1979 season, when renovations to the then-named Donald C. Watson Rink forced the squad to play in local facilities.
In those 62 seasons, never once has the Crimson ventured away from its home ice for more than eight consecutive games—until now. This season, Harvard’s slate includes a record nine-game streak of away contests.
“There’s no doubt that we have a huge upcoming road trip,” sophomore forward Nathan Krusko said. “Those are huge games for us...that we need to rely on at the end of the year to get us in [to the NCAA Tournament].”
In the 2017-2018 season, Harvard will play a regular slate of opponents. Seven non-conference games round out the standard 22 matchups with ECAC foes, with the Crimson visiting and hosting each of the other 11 teams.
The extended road trip, however, is far from ordinary. That stretch runs from early November to the end of the year and features, without a doubt, the stiffest block of competition that Harvard will face all season.
The Crimson will visit Cornell, Minnesota (twice), Boston College, and Quinnipiac, all of whom have cracked the top 20 in the USCHO Division I poll at some point this season. What’s more: These five games are all consecutive.
Since coach Ted Donato ’91 took the reins of the program in 2004, Harvard has seen some comparably long road trips. In 2015-2016, the Jimmy Vesey-led Crimson spent eight straight contests away from the Bright, and in the decade prior, Harvard had three seven-gamers.
In fairness, the length of the road trip is a bit deceptive. After returning from Princeton in early December, the Crimson has its annual four-week hiatus for the winter holidays. So its nine games are relatively spread out, concluding just before the new year.
Besides the copious rest, the team will enjoy a particularly easy Thanksgiving weekend. The “away” game at BC is Harvard’s sole matchup that weekend, as opposed to the usual Friday-Saturday combination. Still, the cross-town rival promises to give the Crimson a run. And playing a third of the season without a home game in between is never easy.
“It’s not like professional hockey where you’re on the road the whole time,” coach Donato said. “We’ll be home quite often in that stretch. We just won’t have a chance to play games at the friendly confines of Bright-Landry.”
Besides, sometimes playing on the road isn’t a bad thing at all.
“I honestly kind of prefer playing on the road,” tri-captain Jake Horton said. “Everything is very structured…. It feels like we’re at home in terms of the hockey aspect and how we’re getting treated, but you just get to focus solely on hockey. There’s none of the other distractors.”
Beyond the sheer length of the “roadie”, Harvard will experience the thrill—and challenge—of playing in some big-time rinks. It’s tough to match the atmosphere inside Minnesota’s 3M Arena at Mariucci, and BC fans always pack the Conte Forum. Plus, Cornell’s Lynah Rink is beyond rowdy for the fish-filled Harvard game each year.
Because of their intense settings, these matchups may present Crimson freshmen with novel and uncomfortable situations. TD Garden in early February is quite possibly the only environment that compares to these fierce barns. But Harvard’s rookies will not have experienced the Beanpot in time for the upcoming away contests.
Subsequently, one of the team’s major tasks in preparation for its long stretch of road play is to ready its youngest players—many of whom play key roles in Harvard’s game—for the big stage. Luckily, the returning players’ experience in the Frozen Four last season should help.
“We’re going to have to do an incredible job talking to [the freshmen], getting their minds right early on, letting them know to be comfortable and be confident,” Krusko said. “Right now, I’m playing with two freshmen, so I really have to carry the load now there.”
And the freshmen are eager to learn.
“It’s really exciting to be able to experience my first taste of other teams’ fan bases and atmospheres, and other college hockey arenas,” freshman forward Jack Badini said. “Nine games is a lot, but hopefully we use it to our advantage…. It’s a great test for us early on this season.”
The Crimson opens the long away spell at Colgate. The Raiders have been an ECAC bottom-dweller of late, so Harvard should have minimal trouble with them. The schedule escalates the following evening, however, when Harvard heads to Ithaca, N.Y.
A senior-led squad downed Cornell, often the Crimson’s toughest Ivy League foe, in all three meetings last season. Nevertheless, this game annually is a toss-up due to the high-energy atmosphere in Lynah. In the last decade, Harvard is 5-7-1 when visiting Cornell, including two ECAC Quarterfinal losses in 2009-2010.
Competition only gets stiffer by mid-November when the Crimson visits the Twin Cities over Harvard-Yale weekend. Harvard has seen Minnesota only once in the last five seasons, but this year the Golden Gophers will entertain the team on back-to-back nights.
“Any time you go to a storied program like Boston College or Minnesota, it’s definitely really exciting considering the history that goes into those programs,” tri-captain Eddie Ellis said. “Being able to…play those teams that we don’t get to play very often and see how we stack up against them is definitely really exciting.”
That weekend is the litmus test of the Crimson’s season. When the two teams meet, the Golden Gophers will have played seven more games than Harvard, and against some of the nation’s best competition. Minnesota also boasts the second-highest NHL draft pick (8th overall) among NCAA players this season in freshman forward Casey Mittelstadt.
Whether the Crimson icemen pass this test or not, a hungry BC team will be waiting for them when they return to Boston. The Eagles are already in desperation mode after going 1-5-1 to start the season thanks to an obscenely difficult first month. All five teams that BC faced in October were ranked, including No. 1 Denver and now-No. 2 St. Cloud State. The Eagles’ early exposure to elite competition will put pressure on Harvard to quickly find its game legs for the contest on Commonwealth Ave.
The meat of the road trip finally in late-November with the Quinnipiac matchup. The Bobcats, led on the blue line by preseason all-ECAC selection Chase Priskie, are frontrunners to compete with the Crimson for the ECAC crown this season.
Ultimately, Harvard’s performance and growth on this road trip will define its season. Formidable opponents, big stages, and the normal adversity that comes with playing on the road all will be working against the Crimson.
“The most important aspect of any team sport is improvement throughout the year,” coach Donato said. “This will give us a chance to really evaluate what we have, what we can do better, and where we’re at. They’re huge games. However, we hope that we’ll play well enough that we’ll have opportunities to have really important games at the end of the season as well.”
The ECAC includes multiple quality teams, but it’s no Hockey East—nor is it the Big Ten or the NCHC. In order to remain atop the NCAA rankings with St. Cloud State and Denver, Harvard needs to prove that it can compete with the best teams. This season’s road stretch is the Crimson’s chance.

“It’s a new year. We lost a lot of great players, a lot of great leadership.”
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, these words from coach Ted Donato ’91 are all too familiar. Each season, and especially the last two, the talent walking the stage in late May seems irreplaceable. And yet, the Crimson is starting to develop a knack for turning over its roster and staying competitive year in and year out.
Last season, the fresh departure of Jimmy Vesey ’16 and Kyle Criscuolo ’16 overshadowed the early portion of Harvard’s 2016-2017 campaign. Vesey was just the fourth Crimson iceman to bring home the Hobey Baker Award, given to the nation’s top player, while “Crisco” was the program’s first two-time captain in over 90 years and a dynamic scorer in his own right.
In a sense, the class of 2016 helped put Harvard hockey back on the map after nearly a decade of irrelevance. Winning ways were mostly ephemeral during this stretch—until Vesey, Criscuolo, Colin Blackwell ’16, and company began laying the foundation for the success they experienced as upperclassmen.
Now, when the Crimson reconvenes after a summer of training, the winning identity cultivated by the outgoing class lingers, and it permeates both new and returning players.
“The teams that we’ve had over the past couple of years, we’ve developed a culture,” tri-captain Eddie Ellis said. “We’ve made it a little easier for freshmen to come in and feel comfortable…. I think all the seniors have done a great job connecting with the freshmen and getting them acclimated to our culture.”
Regardless, the media and fans were skeptical of the Vesey-less Crimson at the outset of last season. Meanwhile, Harvard’s talented freshman class and the team’s capable group of veterans went somewhat underappreciated.
Flash-forward to the following May, and the Crimson was bidding farewell to an even more impactful senior class than the 2016 graduates, Vesey’s Hobey or not. These seven seniors carried the team to its first Frozen Four appearance since 1994, and on its journey the squad captured a Beanpot victory, Ivy League championship, and ECAC regular season and playoff titles.
Despite all the accolades from last season, including a clean sweep of the yearly Ivy League awards and nominations to all three all-ECAC teams, this year’s Harvard squad faces a similar set of lasting questions about its retooled roster. The uncertainty mainly revolves around the forward corps, whose 2017 graduates accounted for 45 percent of the team’s scoring last season.
Before the season, tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen noted the annual underestimation of the program’s rising talent. He doesn’t seem to read into it anymore.
“I think we should give our forwards more credit than they have been getting so far this fall, from anybody,” the netminder said during the preseason.
As Madsen verbalized, the team doesn’t seem too fazed by the task of replacing six forwards and a defenseman, having been through major retools before. Early in 2017-2018, the Crimson will look to last year as a blueprint for maintaining the competitive level that it reached last season.
Just like the players, coach Donato learns with each roster turnover. In March, leading up to a first round game against Providence in the NCAA Tournament, he reflected on the uncertainty his team experienced entering the 2016-2017 season.
“We’ve been fortunate over the last few years to have some talented guys,” coach Donato noted last season. “This year, I don’t think as many people around the country expected us to be as competitive when we lost the Hobey Baker winner [and] when we lost Kyle Criscuolo.”
The Harvard bench boss acknowledged two factors that proved key to one-upping the 2015-2016 squad. For one, last year’s team received more consistent and balanced production than its predecessor. But even more crucial to the Crimson’s improvement year over year was that the players made the most of their larger roles within the lineup.
“I think we’re a different team. I think we’re more balanced,” coach Donato said last season. “We’ve added a couple of very talented young freshmen, and then some of our guys have had a year of development.”
Coach referred to the “development” of seniors Luke Esposito ’17, Sean Malone ’17, Tyler Moy ’17, and co-captain Alexander Kerfoot ’17, who combined to form one of the deadliest attacks in college hockey last season. Senior-led Harvard ranked second among 60 Division I programs in goals per game (4.06) and led the nation in assists per game (6.96), evidence of the team’s elite puck-moving ability.
“It’ll take us some time, like it always does, to establish the identity of the team,” said coach Donato after besting Dartmouth, 5-0, on Sunday. “It’s easy to forget, looking back that last year, at this time we had a bunch of guys who were hoping to take a big step, guys like Esposito and Moy and…Malone.”
As for the seniors specifically, the 2017 graduates finished their final season atop the NCAA in almost every single scoring category. Harvard’s fourth-years led all senior classes in goals, assists, per-game averages for both, power play assists and points, shorthanded goals, and game-winning goals.
“[Last year’s seniors] had the confidence to step up and say, ‘Hey, it wasn’t just [Vesey and Criscuolo], it’s all of us collectively, we've learned a lot, and this is our time to show it,’” sophomore forward Nathan Krusko said. “All of them as individuals did an amazing job showing us, the younger guys, what to do.”
Even after graduating one of the most dynamic offensive talents in program history in Vesey, the team became an offensive juggernaut by replacing its scoring by committee.
Can sophomore Ty Pelton-Byce, juniors Ryan Donato and Lewis Zerter-Gossage, and seniors Seb Lloyd and Jake Horton be this year’s committee? Sadly, it’s not as easy as last year’s seniors made it look.
Seniors no longer dominate the Crimson’s top six. Instead, Harvard will need superlative leadership from tri-captains Horton, Madsen, and Ellis to effectively integrate its freshmen.
As always, the tone in the locker room starts with the captains leading by example. And nobody leads by example by sitting in the stands. Horton, who was battling some nagging injuries ahead of Sunday’s contest, demonstrated his dedication by powering through those ailments and lacing them up on opening night.
“Jake Horton had an unreal summer,” coach Donato lauded. “He’s in beast-mode shape and…he looks like a guy who is on a mission. We’re excited, he’s a leader.”
Even with veteran players like Horton in the top six, surpassing last year’s scoring pace is unlikely. This team draws on experience from the blue line, returning five of last season’s regular fixtures and adding shifty freshman Reilly Walsh to the fold. The keystone of this solid back end is Madsen, who looks to expand his stake in the Harvard record book after a dominant junior season.
Last year’s surge of point production, however, was as obvious a marker of improvement as it was impressive. After all, flashy dangles, needle-threading passes, and six-goal games aren’t exactly the subtlest elements of sport.
Less celebrated than the 396 points scored by last year’s team, and what truly got the group to the United Center in early April, was the timeliness of its scoring. The Crimson potted a league-best 56 goals in the third period last season. Seeing the importance of this clutch factor, coach Donato has already challenged this year’s team to maintain it.
“We’ll certainly be able to be dangerous,” coach Donato said. “The challenge is, can we score when the game is on the line? I think last year we were able to do that, [but] it’s a new year and it’s a new challenge.”
This season will be full of these challenges for the Crimson. Can Harvard channel the winning culture left behind by past players to overcome them?

Before 2016-2017, the last time the Harvard women’s ice hockey team won five games or fewer was its second season. That was back in 1979-1980, when it started the season with six consecutive losses and never quite recovered. The team finished with a record of 4-13.
Thirty-seven years later, the Crimson struggled to a 5-19-5 mark, racking up the most losses in team history. For Harvard head coach Katey Stone, though, the journey is nothing new—entering her 23rd season, Stone has experienced everything from 15-game winless streaks to 33-win seasons.
This is just part of the process.
Heading into the 2017-2018 season, though, the players donning the Crimson have set out to prove that last season was nothing more than an aberration in the rich, decades-long history of Harvard women’s hockey.
To this end, the Crimson has gotten off to the right foot, going 2-1 in three straight matchups against ECAC opponents to start the year. Harvard’s victories have been comfortable, too, as it has outscored its opposition, 9-4.
An even better sign for the team is that these results exclude the Crimson’s exhibition contest against McGill—Harvard dominated a McGill team that picked up 29 wins last season in a resounding 6-1 victory.
Ostensibly, last year’s 5-19-5 record seems like a big step back from the Crimson’s usual winning ways. However, those who watched the 2016-2017 games closely might know that the team was more the victim of bad timing than of bad team play.
Of Harvard’s losses, nine were by just one goal. Of its wins, only one came by the same margin. One stray shot or one extra pass could have been the difference between last year’s record and the one from the year prior, where the team went 17-12-3, ultimately losing to Colgate in the ECAC quarterfinals.
This year, the team is making sure to take the extra steps necessary to put away close games.
“Every week, we’re talking about what we need to do to be better going forward,” co-captain Kate Hallett said. “A big thing that we’re emphasizing is taking last year and learning from it. This year, we want to focus on playing a full 60 minutes, and holding each other accountable.”
Roster composition is another noticeable difference coming into this season. After graduating several key seniors, the 2016-2017 team relied on production from several of its freshmen and sophomores.
In addition, of the 21 members of last season’s roster, six were freshmen. With an extra year of experience under their belts, these players come into this season hopeful to build off their progress from last year.
“A huge piece of playing well is your relationship with the team and the comradery,” Hallett said. “Having another year to be with one another is only going to help us get better on the ice.

One of those players in particular is sophomore goalie Beth Larcom. As a freshman, Larcom was limited to just eight starts, as she was listed behind then-senior Molly Tissenbaum on the depth chart.
However, with Tissenbaum’s graduation this past May, Larcom now holds the reins to the defense and has started every game to begin the year. In three games, Larcom has conceded an average of only 1.68 goals per game. In comparison, last year’s team allowed an average of 2.66 goals per game.
“Beth worked really hard all summer to put herself in the best possible position to help us win games,” senior defender Dani Krzyszczyk said. “Her hard work has definitely translated on the ice and has given her a lot of confidence, especially in high pressure situations. I also think she, like many others on our team, are really focusing on having fun and enjoying the moment”
Larcom has also anchored the team in making 75 total saves, good for a 93.8% save percentage. It is no surprise that she has been a big part in Harvard’s 2-1 start to the season. Larcom is just one example of how an extra year of growth and opportunity will help this year’s team going forward.
Bolstering the play of the team’s returners are eight rookies new to the Crimson roster. Although it’s expected that it will take time for freshmen to adjust to playing at the collegiate level, the Harvard freshmen this year have exceeded expectations.
In fact, the newcomers have been key to the team’s hot start. Freshman forwards Lunasa Sano, Keely Moy and Brooke Jovanovich were the reason Crimson beat Princeton 3-2 on Friday—the three rookies scored one goal apiece to make up the totality of the offense.
With only a few graduated players, the Tigers team is essentially the same one which defeated Harvard in both of its matchups last season. Friday’s result provides yet another look into the team’s potential as the season picks up.
Helping to oversee this change and acclimate the freshmen are the team’s three captains. Senior forwards Lexie Laing and Haley Mullins join Hallett in serving as the team’s newest tri-captains.
Laing enters the season a year after leading the team in points, scoring eight goals and contributing 13 assists last season. Following this season, she plans to join the Boston Pride in the NWHL after being selected with the 12th overall pick in the 2017 draft.
Mullins enters the season hoping to build off her career year last season, where she picked up 13 points off nine goals and four assists.
After contributing three goals and two assists in her sophomore season, Hallett finds herself as the Crimson’s first junior captain since the 2014-15 season.
“Having been elected captain was an incredible honor; there’s no words to say as to how much it means to me,” Hallett said. “In regards to preparing myself, I made sure that everything in my life was in check so that I could give myself fully to my team. That way, I can be there for all of my teammates and try to put them before myself.”
Amidst the changes and development of the players, Coach Stone remains the one constant. Anointed the Landry Family Head Coaching position just before the 1994-95 season, Stone has amassed over 450 victories en route to becoming the winningest coach in Division 1 women’s hockey.
In her career with the team, Stone has led the Crimson to four NCAA Division 1 championships, 11 tournament appearances, six ECAC tournament championships, and eight Ivy League titles. Stone’s only time away from the team came in 2013-14, when she served as the head coach for the United States Women’s Ice Hockey team at the Sochi Winter Olympics.
With all of these elements in place, Harvard is poised for success in the upcoming season. However, the team will need to maintain its high level of play if it wishes to stay competitive in the ECAC, which has traditionally been one of the toughest conferences in Division 1. The Crimson remains confident in its ability to rise to this challenge.
“Our team wants to win a national championship, but we also understand that that is not achieved overnight,” Krzyszczyk said. “This year we are really just trying to focus on one game at a time and not looking too far ahead. Every point is important in this league and we are truly focusing getting the next point.”

Historically, our friendly neighbors to the North have been characterized by several stereotypes: hockey, maple syrup, Tim Hortons, and excessive politeness.
A new cultural phenomenon, however, has begun to define Canada in the past few years: a craze for basketball.
Centered largely in the eastern province of Ontario and the metropolis of Toronto, Canadian basketball has hit record levels of popularity, both culturally and professionally. From the “We the North” movement spurring sold out crowds at Air Canada Centre—home of the NBA’s Toronto Raptors—to the hotbed of talent in the area propagating stars such as Andrew Wiggins and Tristan Thompson, Canadian basketball is no longer an afterthought for college and professional scouts.
Under head coach Tommy Amaker, Harvard men’s basketball has certainly taken notice.
This year, three Crimson players hail from the province of Ontario: senior captain Chris Egi, junior guard Corey Johnson, and freshman forward Danilo Djuricic. Additionally, Amaker secured a verbal commitment this fall from Noah Kirkwood, a 6’6” guard from Kanata, Ontario.
“We are really fortunate to have a number of kids from Canada and are hoping that it won’t stop,” Amaker said. “They have all been terrific players and even better people. Now having Danilo in that line, we think he will be exactly like those guys.”
Harvard basketball fans from previous years are certainly aware of the significant contributions that Egi and Johnson have made to the team. An important player for the Crimson early in the 2016-2017 season, Egi started seven games and averaged 8.8 minutes per game as a tough, interior-minded player. Johnson has been one of Harvard’s main weapons from the three-point range, knocking down 62 triples last season off 18 starts.
“We expect Corey to be a good player for us,” Amaker said. “We need him to think of himself as a key guy for this team because he is. We are hopeful that he will get off to a good start and gain that confidence and momentum that he had a good portion of last year.”
Interestingly for Egi and Johnson, both players followed similar pre-college paths. Egi played varsity basketball at St. Andrew’s, a boarding school in Aurora, Ontario, for four years before accepting an offer to play a post-graduate season at Montverde Academy in Central Florida. There, Egi played alongside several notable players, including current NBA point guards Ben Simmons and D’Angelo Russell.
Johnson also secured a transfer to an American academy his final year of high school, playing at Vermont Academy after four years at West Carleton Secondary School in Dunrobin, Ontario.
Another common thread for these Crimson players is their common experiences donning the red-and-white for their native country. Djuricic not only was a two-year captain for St. Michael’s College School but led the Canadian men’s national U16 and U17 teams.
Few Ivy League players get the chance to play at the international level, so the experience has primed the young players for tough competition. For example, Djuricic led Team Canada to the silver medal in the U16 FIBA Americas tournament in 2015, where he faced up against top-level talent including Duke freshman Wendell Carter and Kentucky freshman Jarred Vanderbilt.
In this year’s FIBA U19 Basketball World Cup in Egypt, Djuricic and Kirkwood helped Team Canada pull off a remarkable upset, claiming its first-ever first-place finish in the history of the tournament. Djuricic was a key piece to the team’s success, averaging 10.4 points and 4.7 rebounds in the tournament.
“We are really high on Danilo,” Amaker said. “He can play in and out and is a very good shooter for his size, which really opens the floor a bit more. I think our guys are really confident in him taking those shots and making those shots.”
Djuricic was also a familiar face for Egi in past years, having previously played alongside him in the Ontario basketball circuit.
“I knew Danilo when he was in 6th grade—I took him on a tour of my high school,” Egi said. “Obviously this is a smaller [freshman] class than last year’s class, so I feel like because they’re a smaller part of our team, it is a little bit of a different dynamic. It’s just getting them up to speed on the college game as fast as possible because obviously we want them to help us.”
Harvard veterans Egi and Johnson are also no strangers to the national team, having been teammates in the U19 World Championships in 2015. The two guided Team Canada to a fifth-place finish.
Without question, the opportunity for these players to compete in a non-Crimson uniform has also solidified their relationships. In fact, there’s a push among the Canadian players for greater recognition of their national identity at Lavietes Pavilion.
“It’s been one of the running jokes on our team,” Amaker said. “They are putting it on my shoulders that we need to have the Canadian flag with the American flag.”
Regardless of this infusion of “True North” pride, the team must put aside national loyalties this year as it searches for a new team identity. After losing former captains Siyani Chambers ’17 and Zena Edosomwan ’16, there appears to be no definitive team leader.
In searching for a new torchbearer for this team, Amaker will certainly look towards Egi and other upperclassmen to continue to strengthen the on- and off-court chemistry for the Crimson.
“It’s just a matter of spending the whole summer just focused on getting the guys together, getting everybody motivated, and making sure everybody’s going to work.” Egi said. “Again—having that sense of urgency, having that hunger.”
In fostering this type of camaraderie and determination, Harvard may benefit from looking to the last line of the Canadian national anthem: “O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.”
The Crimson look to elevate its brand of basketball this season. In this discovery of a new identity, the team’s Canadians will play a crucial role as important guardians of this program.

The Harvard women’s basketball team has a concise yet powerful guiding principle: “We over me.” This team motto embodies the attitudes of the newest additions to the squad, the incoming freshman class.
“They have fit in perfectly,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “ They’re incredibly talented. I want to put their drive and work ethic at the top of the list. I think a lot of them, in one way or another, are going to make an impact on us.”
With the new cohort of freshmen forwards Rachel Levy, Grace Tworek, Maddie Stuhlreyer, and Jadyn Bush and rookie guard Matilda Salen, Harvard looks to bolster a unit that went 21-9 overall last season, with an 8-6 in-conference record. Although the Crimson lost in the Ivy League semifinals, at one point the team had won 16 consecutive matchups.
Stuhlreyer, the team’s new tallest forward at 6’5”, hails from Cincinnati, Ohio, where she played AAU basketball in high school. Although the commitment is huge for the travel basketball circuit, it pales in comparison to playing in the Ivy League. Here, the expectations are higher, the schedule is demanding, and commitments extend beyond the court.
However, having three classes of older teammates at her disposal, Stuhlreyer has adjusted to her new responsibilities. At practice, Stuhlreyer and her fellow freshmen prod upperclassmen for advice, both about basketball and about life at Harvard.
“I am very excited to be in the position that I am because I am constantly challenged by the older girls,” Stuhlreyer said. “I can see my game improve because I am playing against such good competition in practice.”
Given the quality of preseason play from Stuhlreyer and other new post players, it is likely that the Crimson freshmen will see game time this season.
“We have some incredibly talented freshmen that we’re looking at that we can play in the four spot,” Delaney-Smith said.
The freshmen add to the depth of the team’s frontcourt, which was key last season and will most likely prove essential this year.
Levy, another freshman forward, has long awaited getting on the floor at Lavietes Pavilion. In her senior year, Levy led her high school from Boca Raton, Fla., to its first-ever state title. The McDonald’s All-American nominee has recovered from a knee fracture this summer. The experience has only added to her desire to see action on the court.
“Coming back from my first real injury has been tough,” Levy said. “But having been cleared, I’m really excited for what the future holds.”
Tworek, the youngest of four siblings from Chicago, Ill., was playing soccer and volleyball going into high school before deciding to focus on basketball. This decision proved wise, as she led her team to the state tournament three straight years.
Bush, who started four years on the varsity team from Bishop Blanchet High School in Seattle, Wash., has enjoyed the close bonds formed on her team. Having played three years of high school ball alongside her younger sister, who is still on the West Coast, the rookie has compensated for the absence of her sibling by forming other close bonds.
“The closeness of our team makes the fact that I am attending school across the country from my home much easier,” Bush said.
Bush is not the only new freshman far from her home. Matilda Salen, the lone guard in the freshman class, traveled over 3,700 miles from home to Harvard. Salen grew up in Stockholm, Sweden, before coming across the pond to study and play in Cambridge.
Salen has been playing basketball since she was eight years old on a variety of club teams and on the Sweden U16, U17, U18, and U20 national teams. In 2016, Salen’s U18 team won the European Championship. She has found her experience playing for the Crimson vastly different from that at home, however.
“We don’t have high school or college teams in Sweden,” Salen explained. “So I’ve never played with people I’ve practiced with at school before…. It’s better for the team dynamic.”
Playing at the demanding collegiate level and balancing academics is a new and challenging experience for all of the freshmen, since academics are the top priority at Harvard.
“Academically, it’s more challenging than I’m used to,” Salen explained. “Everything works differently than in Sweden.”
Integrating into a new team and a new environment is never an easy task, but this group of talented players has made the effort to connect with their teammates and become a cohesive whole.
“Bringing in a class of five is always a challenge,” captain Kirby Porter said. “But I think that as a group, they’ve done such an amazing job this preseason of getting acclimated and really giving their all out on the court and showing what they’re capable of.”
Just a week removed from the season opener against Dayton, the freshmen are moving out of the transition stage and into the regular season.
“This is the first time for all of us playing with them, so we’re all excited as we move into our season,” said Porter. “I’m still looking forward to seeing how much they will contribute this year, which I think will be a lot.”

“Consistency.”
For a team that won 16 in a row last season and hasn’t finished below third in the Ivy League in the past 11 years, it may seem strange to say that consistency is what’s lacking.
But if you ask head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, who is starting her 36th year at the helm of Harvard women’s basketball, consistency is just what the team must emphasize.
“For us, the difference is consistency,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were consistent through our 16-game winning streak and then had some inconsistent performances. I think we have to grow in that area. We were young, so I think that will be a difference-maker for us this year.”
Co-captain Kirby Porter echoed the thought.
“I think we’re coming off a really strong season in which we all realized as a team what we’re capable of,” Porter said. “One of our main priorities is remaining consistent. It’s a very long season, and it’s challenging for all teams to remain consistent. But I think that was one of our Achilles’ heels last season, so that’s definitely one of our priorities moving forward.”
While the Crimson aims to move forward, Harvard may feel a tempted to look back at certain parts of last year. And what a season 2016-2017 was. The team posted a 16-game win streak to tie a program record. Then-rookie guard Katie Benzan led the team in scoring, contributing nearly 14 points per game while becoming the first Harvard rookie since 2002 to earn All-Ivy honors as a freshman. The young squad ranked as high at 28th in the nation according to NCAA RPI rankings.
What’s perhaps most notable heading into the new season, though, is the degree to which the pieces on this year’s squad remain unchanged. All told, the Crimson returns players who accounted for over 80 percent of scoring from the previous year.
As much as consistency matters, Harvard will also rely on depth across the board. Seven returning players averaged 10 or more minutes per game last year, with contributors such as junior co-captain Madeline Raster, classmates Nani Redford and Sydney Skinner, and sophomores Benzan and Jeannie Boehm all playing significant time since they stepped on campus as freshmen.
“I would say our X-factor this year is definitely how deep we are,” Porter said. “From top to bottom, everyone knew their role and was able to contribute in their own way. I think our biggest strength is definitely our depth, and that’s what’s unique about our team every year.”
While the departure of forward Destiny Nunley certainly leaves a gap at the four spot, Delaney-Smith’s squad appears to have the personnel to fill the void. Senior Taylor Rooks aims to take a bigger role in her last season, while an unusually tall freshman class—four of the five rookies stand 6’0” or taller—has demonstrated its merits early on.
“I think there’s just a number of people,” Delaney-Smith said. “We have a lot of freshman who will able to play the four spot where Destiny played.”
In the mix is an athletic freshman Jadyn Bush, while another notable addition comes in the form of 6’5’’ forward Maddie Stuhlreyer, now the tallest player on Harvard’s team and tied for the second-tallest listed player in the conference.
While the freshmen look to carve out roles for themselves, and the team overall is underclassmen-heavy, Delaney-Smith will no doubt look to the experience of some key veterans.
Raster has been among the most consistent players on the roster, playing over 25 minutes per game since her freshman year and averaging 10.6 points per game last season. On a team that lives beyond the perimeter, Raster stands out for her ability to take players off the dribble and drive the ball inside.
Benzan and Boehm, for their part, come back with big expectations.
“Both came off very strong freshman campaigns,” Porter said. “I think one of the first things all of us noted when we came back is that they raised their standards for themselves. It’s just been so amazing to see them come back even better than they were last year.”
Benzan hopes to replicate an All-Ivy freshman year. Meanwhile, Boehm aims to build upon a solid rookie year and a wealth of experience both on Harvard’s squad and the USA Basketball U19 team.
“Both of them had a tremendous freshman year, but now that that’s behind them, both of them have improved immensely, especially Jeannie,” Delaney-Smith said. “I would say one of the hardest transitions is being an inside player and going from high school to college. It’s apples and oranges…. Jeannie has grown enormously.”
Picked to finish third in the Ivy League behind Princeton and Penn in the preseason poll, the Crimson faces some serious competition as it looks to win its first share of a conference championship since 2008. While Harvard has finished in the top three in each of the last 11 years, the last time that Harvard danced was in 2007. Last season, Penn spoiled the Crimson’s 16-game streak by handing them a 20-point loss in Philadelphia.
The Quakers lost a single conference game last season, and despite the loss of standout forward Sydney Stipanovich to graduation, Penn returns a good portion of its conference-winning talent. Princeton comes back with plenty of young talent—perhaps most notably Boehm’s U19 teammate, Bella Alarie.
While the conference competition remains strong, Delaney-Smith is confident in her returning talent.
“We’re not surprised that we were picked third, but we’re probably a little better than that given who we returned,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were one of the youngest teams in the country last year and will certainly miss our seniors. But the core is back, the nucleus is back, and that one year under your belt, especially for the freshman, makes a world of difference.”
With the Crimson taking part in three tournaments this season, including games against NCAA tournament teams Dayton, Temple, and FGCU, Harvard will face some opponents.
If Delaney-Smith’s 35 seasons, 11 Ivy League titles, and 567 career wins are any indication, however, her squad is ready for the task. Come the end of the season, the Crimson will likely be competing for a spot in the conference tournament and a chance to dance in March.
“When we hit a bump in the road or we’re faced with a challenge...we work very hard at a solution and move forward,” Delaney-Smith said. “This is a very talented team, this is a very deep team, and our job is to stay consistent.”

When the Harvard women’s hockey team took on Princeton last weekend, a familiar face sat in the stands. Miye D’Oench ’16, former forward for the team, drove to Princeton, N.J. from her home in New York to watch the Crimson’s first road game of the season.
“There’s really nothing like college hockey,” D’Oench says. “I have bonds with teammates on my college team that are unlike anything else in my life.”
D’Oench’s career with Harvard, a time that saw her lead team scoring in her senior year, is over. But her hockey career goes on. The day after cheering on her former teammates, D’Oench laced up her skates and joined the National Women’s Hockey League’s Metropolitan Riveters in their home opener against the Boston Pride.
The Riveters, based in Newark, announced a partnership with the New Jersey Devils this season. The game against the Pride was held in the Devils’ arena, the Prudential Center. For D’Oench and many others, the deal is an encouraging sign of progress for the women’s game.
North America is home to two women’s professional hockey leagues: the American NWHL, and the Canadian Women’s Hockey League. The CWHL has been around since 2007, with franchises in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Markham, Boston, and, as of this season, Kunlun and Vanke in Shenzhen, China.
The NWHL was the upstart American league of 2015, with teams in Boston, Buffalo, Stamford, and Newark, drawing much of the American talent away from the Canadian league. Each league comes with its benefits and complications, however.
The CWHL, for instance, did not start paying its players until this season, and the appeal of the NWHL was that it promised good pay—until last year, when salaries were dramatically slashed.
The two leagues present a unique challenge to any athlete looking to go pro since the final decision—which league to choose, what team to play for—often comes down to logistics.
Crimson tri-captain and Boston Pride draft pick Lexie Laing knows that despite the circumstances being in her favor, much could change in the next year before she can join a professional team. She’s from Massachusetts, and both of her older sisters, former Harvard goalie Brianna Laing ’16 and Princeton graduate Denna Laing, have played with the Pride.
“I am definitely considering playing for the Pride as of right now,” Laing says. “It all depends on where I am next year for work, or [if I’m] back at school. [But] I’m not ready to give up playing.”
On the other hand, Crimson junior forward Karly Heffernan, a two-time U18 Worlds gold medallist for Canada, will also have to think about whether to return to her home country or not.
“After college I definitely want to pursue it, as long as I’m healthy,” Heffernan says. “And as long as it’s worth it, I guess. It really depends where I get a job after graduating.”
Playing women’s hockey can often feel like the guts without the glory, at least where finances are concerned. Many athletes juggle full-time jobs along with their practice schedules. D’Oench found a job first, and then arranged a trade between the Pride, the team that had drafted her, and the Riveters so that she could keep both her jobs. Others have done the opposite.
“I signed first and found a job after,” says former Harvard captain and Riveters defender Michelle Picard ’15-’16. “I ended up just deciding to sign with New York, and then was like, ‘Okay there’s a lot of schools in that area, let’s see what I can find.’”
Knowing that many players are forced to make this compromise, both leagues are structured so 9-to-5 employees can still come to the rink: practices are at night, and games are only on weekends. To Picard and D’Oench, who have only played in the NWHL, this system is good enough.
“Our coach is really understanding if I’m going to be late because I had to work late,” says D’Oench. “We’re treated like professionals. We’re not babysat and told where to be and when. It’s up to you to show up ready to play.”
A former Harvard captain and finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award—given to the nation’s top women’s ice hockey player—forward Jillian Dempsey ’13 has had a different experience. Dempsey graduated as an Olympic hopeful, but found herself cut from the Team USA roster. She turned to the only pro league at the time: the CWHL. Back then, she was playing without pay, like all CWHL players, when rumors of another league started to go around.
For American players in the CWHL, the chance to play for a league that both paid its players and was based in the U.S. was intriguing, to say the least. But even to attend the tryout meant voiding the contracts they had signed with their current teams, and the athletes were understandably wary.
“So many newer things come on and they work for a little and then they kind of just drop off,” Dempsey says. “We didn’t want to jeopardize what we had with the CWHL. But as a group, most people collectively were like, ‘You know what, this is the time to go for it, so let’s do it.’”
In 2015, the Blades won the CWHL’s Clarkson Cup. Only a few months later, over a dozen of them left for the NWHL. Now, 18 of the 28 players from the Blades’ cup-winning roster play for the newer league.
“We were nervous about...whether it was going to be for real, but obviously it was, and it turned out pretty well from there,” Dempsey says with a laugh.
With much of the league’s starpower away training for the upcoming Olympics, many women will have their chance in the spotlight. Dempsey is one of them—she captains the Boston Pride this year.
A year after Dempsey left the CWHL, another former Crimson captain joined it. Emerance Maschmeyer ’16, Harvard’s all-time career saves leader, is one of a few dozen players in each league for whom international play is a reality, not a dream. Maschmeyer has won three silver medals with Canada at Worlds and is currently both a goalie for Les Canadiennes de Montréal and an alternate for Canada’s Olympic team. That means she receives subsidies from Hockey Canada and the Canadian government.
The netminder is not as financially dependent on the league as others and has time to attend school in between playing. But her position also ushers in an element of unpredictability: she could get called up to play for the national team at the drop of a hat—something that’s already happened this season.
“It keeps you on your toes,” Maschmeyer laughs. “I’m a planner and I like having things laid out… [but] you acquire different skills with different adversities. For me, it’s [about] doing what I need to do each day.”
Things have fallen into place for Maschmeyer, an Alberta native, who started out with the Calgary Inferno because of the city’s status as the headquarters of Hockey Canada. Now, she’s relocated to Montréal, another massive hockey market. The partnership that the Canadiennes have with the NHL’s Canadiens, she thinks, is significant in a number of ways.
“Our name, Les Canadiennes, makes [us] so much more recognizable…[in] Montréal and Quebec,” Maschmeyer says. “Our jerseys and our logos, [they] look very similar to the Canadiens’. [The Canadiens] try to give us as much exposure as possible.”
Still, it’s not all sunshine and roses. The shiny benefits that the NWHL once advertised—free equipment, good pay—have waned because of the league’s financial issues. When salary cuts were announced last November, players considered a boycott at the same time the U.S. national team was threatening a boycott for fair pay, too. Ultimately, the NWHL schedule went on uninterrupted, but the underlying issues have yet to be resolved.
“People sign leases, they have lives,” says D’Oench, the frustration audible in her voice. “But it was a testament to the resilience of women’s hockey players. I think a lot of athletes, understandably, would’ve just boycotted...it probably would’ve meant the league folding. Everybody just kind of sucked it up and said, ‘we want this for the future, rather than the $10,000 I’m owed now.’”
Picard acknowledges that this can be a frustrating experience, having to shelve their concerns in the hopes of growing the game.
“Two years ago or three years ago, I had nothing for after college,” she points out. “At the end of the day, it’s a business, and we’ve got to sell a product. Once we do that maybe more money will come in.”
A major concern of both fans and players is the mere presence of two leagues. It would be easier to acquire viewership if these leagues didn’t have to compete with each other.
“Women’s hockey is growing so much,” Maschmeyer says. “The leagues are going to have to continue to expand, or combine one way or another. It would be nice if we could...work as one unit together. I know we’re all moving in the same direction.”
A country and a league away, Dempsey agrees.
“If we could get everybody on the same page and have it be one league...most of us are hoping that can happen someday,” she says, before adding wryly, “Someday soon, too, while we’re still playing. That’d be nice.”
Change is certainly on the horizon. The CWHL’s Chinese teams are debuting this year in an effort to cultivate a major fanbase in Asia ahead of the next two Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and Beijing. The NWHL has re-signed with Dunkin’ Donuts and is looking to partner with more NHL teams. For now, Harvard women considering professional careers in hockey will have to prepare for both the gruelling balance of work and play, and the uncertainty of what is to come. That’s a secondary concern, though, if they get to pursue the game they love.
“I think all of us are in the same position where we all love to play hockey,” Laing says. “If we don't have to stop then why would we?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 89 minutes last Saturday, Harvard senior goalie Kyle Parks was perfect. Tallying 11 saves on the night, it wasn’t until the final 31 seconds that Dartmouth landed its first shot, a bicycle kick from inside the box. With the the goal, the Big Green won the game and effectively removed the Crimson from Ivy League title contention.
Following the home loss and a week of rest, the Harvard men’s soccer team will travel on Sunday to No. 25 Columbia in search of its second conference win in its final road match up.
The Lions (8-2-3, 3-1-1 Ivy) have enjoyed a strong 2017 campaign, losing only once in the past month. On the home stretch, the team is still vying for the Ancient Eight title and a berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Despite the standings, history will be on Harvard’s side entering Sunday’s match up. The Crimson (2-8-4, 1-2-2) has defeated Columbia in each of the last three contests between the two divisional rivals, and leads the overall series 38-23-5. Although only the Lions are favored to win this year, that could benefit Harvard on Sunday.
“We don’t have any pressure on us to win, we’re coming in as underdogs,” said Crimson defender and co-captain Justin Crichlow. “Without that pressure, we can just think about having fun and playing soccer, and I think we’ll be at our best because of that.”
While Harvard’s offense has struggled at times, the defense has remained stout, conceding no more than one goal in six of the past seven games.
Parks has played particularly well throughout the 2017 campaign, behind a defense anchored by co-captains Crichlow and Eric Gylling. Parks has recorded career highs in saves in multiple games this season, and preserved a tie with heroic saves in overtime tilts against Northeastern and New Hampshire.
Although the Crimson has struggled at home, the team will hope to improve upon its 2-3 road record, which includes a thrilling come from behind 2-1 victory over rival Yale.
Beating the Lions will be no small task. Columbia has impressively conceded more than one goal just once over its 13 games, and has given up fewer than half a goal per game across the season.
The key to the Lions’ defensive prowess has been strong net minding from junior Dylan Castanheira, who has started each of Columbia’s 13 games, recording eight clean sheets and allowing just six goals all season.
To break down Castanheira and the Lions, Harvard must look to put shots on target, like it did in recent 1-1 draws against Brown and Princeton, when the Crimson fired 21 shots in each contest.
“Hopefully we can generate a little more offense,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “We’ve definitely done that in the past few games.”
On the defensive side, Gylling, Crichlow, and the rest of the back line must remain sturdy against a dangerous Columbia offense that has scored almost a goal and a half per game.
The Lions’ offense is led by South African senior forward Arthur Bosua, who has scored seven of the team’s 18 goals. Bosua and the rest of the offense has had no trouble finding the back of the net at home, recording 3-0 victories over Brown and Penn and boasting a dominant 5-1 record in New York City.
“A lot of the goals that have come against us this season have been off of set pieces,” Crichlow said. “We’re going to try to avoid giving up those set pieces against Columbia, and continue to grind out games and work together.”
Crucial to Harvard’s success is the offensive impact of Sady and sophomore forward Philip Hausen. The sophomore, who has scored in two of his last three games, leads the team in both goals and assists, and the Crimson is undefeated when he scores. Meanwhile, Sady, who has struggled with injury at times during the season, was the hero in Harvard’s 2-1 comeback win at Yale, scoring in the dying minutes.
For Crichlow, Sady, and the rest of the Harvard seniors, Sunday marks the final road game of their collegiate careers. And while the season might not have gone as well as the Crimson had hoped, the team’s resolve remains strong.
“It’s my last road trip, so obviously that’s a little sad,” Sady admitted. “But we’re going to approach this game like we do every other one, with a professional mentality, and hope for the best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard football extended a long winning streak against a conference opponent. This Saturday, the Crimson must do the same to remain relevant in the Ivy League title race.
Following a 25-22 victory over Dartmouth at home, Harvard (4-3, 2-2 Ivy) has now won 14 consecutive games against the Big Green. With three weeks left in the season, this win keeps the Crimson in the running for the Ancient Eight Crown, only one victory behind from the first place teams—Yale, Columbia, and Cornell.
A week after its most recent loss to Dartmouth, Harvard fell to Columbia as well—16-13, on the road. Since that 2003 contest, the Lions have yet to take down the Crimson again.
However, this edition of Columbia football (6-1, 3-1) is not what fans are accustomed to seeing. Under the leadership of longtime Penn coach Al Bagnoli, the Lions have clinched a winning record for the first time since 1996.
“Number one, you do have to give their previous staff credit,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They’ve got some really good senior football players that were recruited by a different staff. I think the rest is just due to Coach Bagnoli and his staff. First of all, he’s assembled an outstanding staff. Two, they said ‘We’re going to play great defense.’”
That “great defense” is a very unconventional style—in 2017, that is. Bagnoli and his staff decided to go back to basics, putting an extra man in the box to defend against the run and opting for man coverage on almost every play. Facing such a defense might complicate the Crimson’s run-pass option, which is typically more effective against common Ivy defenses.
“Well I think that for our league it is very counter-culture,” Murphy said. “Everybody these days is playing some type of multiple-coverage, middle-open defense where their outside linebacker is trying to be involved in run and pass. But they just said, ‘The heck with that. We’re going back to old-school.’
So far, it seems like Bagnoli’s system has been working. Through seven games, Columbia has outscored opponents by 43 points. Junior defensive back Ryan Gilbert paces the squad with 70 total tackles. Senior defensive back Landon Baty has two interceptions and two forced fumbles, while fellow defensive back Benjamin McKeighan has two picks of his own.
It is not just the Lions defense that gives opposing teams pause, Columbia utilizes a pass-heavy attack on offense guided by signal caller Anders Hill. The senior has 14 touchdowns and 1,838 yards in the air to supplement a 62.5 completion percentage.Hill’s success is due, in part, to the two-headed monster lining up out wide. Sophomores Josh Wainwright and Ronald Smith II have combined to post 1089 receiving yards.
“We’re definitely looking at number 13 [Wainwright],” junior linebacker Charlie Walker said. “He’s supposed to be a really outstanding wide receiver, so we’ve got some things for him [so that he] never get[s] the ball ever again. We don’t see any problems that scare us whatsoever.”
Though the Lions have proven they belong in the conversation for the top Ivy team, many of their victories have been nail-biters. Four out of six wins have been by five points or fewer.
Opposite Columbia will be a Harvard unit that put up its first true statement victory of the season a week ago. The Crimson looks to ride this newfound momentum, especially to try to overcome a thin defensive corps.
On offense, it seems like the league has adjusted to the run-centric Harvard offense. For instance, the Crimson has relied less on stalwart running back Charlie Booker in recent weeks, especially in the red zone. The junior had four touchdowns through the first three games, but he has just two since then.
Instead, there has been more focus on the aerial attack, which is captained by the arm of freshman quarterback Jake Smith. Smith broke out for career highs in yards (268) against Princeton and touchdowns (three) against Dartmouth.
Unlike the Lions, Harvard mixes and matches its receivers and tight ends, having no true workhorse pass-catcher. Last week, senior tight end Ryan Antonellis hauled in two touchdowns, but he only advanced 21 yards on three catches.
“The game plan’s a little different this week,” Antonellis said. “We’re looking to run the ball more this week, so definitely not planning on having two touchdowns again. And we’re going to play more tight ends this week, so that’s definitely different.”
In a game which could dictate the fates of both teams, making adjustments and fine-tuning the game plan is crucial. But sometimes it’s just about who wants it more.
“[The Lions] are true believers,” Murphy said. “And there’s nothing tougher than playing against a team of true believers.”

Zena Edosomwan’s layup beat the buzzer but it was not enough to extend his college career. Bryce Aiken held his head in his hands. Balsa Dragovic consoled Siyani Chambers as the rest of his teammates lined up to shake hands. Yale had lived to see another day.
Eight months after losing to the Bulldogs in a semifinal of the inaugural Ivy League Tournament, the Harvard men’s basketball team is hungry.
“We worked a lot harder, I think, than we started out last year,” sophomore forward Seth Towns said. “Coach harps on no regrets, and I think we have regrets after that game. We all attacked the summer with a ton of vengeance.”
“Going into this summer, we just grinded,” sophomore guard Bryce Aiken added. “I know each and every one of us just grinded, grinded, grinded because we know what our goals are this year and how we want to finish the season.”
It’s November and Harvard coach Tommy Amaker is discussing the defeat at the hands of his team’s biggest rival. He describes it as “crushing” and “gut-wrenching”, says that his players felt like they had had their hearts ripped out, and compares it to his team’s 2011 Ivy League playoff loss to Princeton, a game which Amaker often cites as one of the most devastating of his coaching career.
“They put everything they had into it and you can still do that and not get out of it what you wanted or what you thought you deserved,” Amaker said. “We always want to be in a position where we think we deserve things and even when you deserve things, that doesn’t always mean you get it.”
But Amaker, who is entering his 11th season at the helm, also uses words like “catalyst” and “propel” when describing the ramifications of this game for his program.
“I just felt like when you have it there like that and you’re able to push through later or next time, boy, sometimes the dam breaks and here comes the waterfall,” Amaker said.
Amaker emphasizes that every team that he has coached has been different. While this year’s squad returns 73 percent of its minutes from a season ago, the team will feel very different than the 2016-2017 version of the Crimson, which was largely Chambers and Edosomwan playing with an extremely talented but extremely young roster. Amaker has had ten different teams at Harvard, but his tenure can largely be broken up into a few eras. From his hiring in 2007 through the 2011 season, the Crimson was building its foundation—Amaker was bringing in his recruits, the team began picking up some wins against marquee opponents, and in 2011, it won a share of the Ivy League crown for the first time ever.
For all the raw emotion and heartbreak, the 2011 Princeton playoff game may have been the moment that took Harvard from good to great, from a cool story to a conference dynasty, from a middle-of-the-pack Ivy to a mid-major powerhouse. Following the loss, Harvard would go on to win 118 of its next 153 games (a .771 winning percentage), capture the league crown four years in a row, win two NCAA Tournament games, and take perennial powers Michigan State and North Carolina to the brink.
“I’ve always talked about how you can really trace some great organizations, teams, players where that moment, where they felt that their heart was ripped out, and that became the defining moment,” Amaker said. “I’ve been on some of those teams, I’ve been a part of some of those kinds of moments so we’re hopeful that we’ll look at moments that can define us and propel us and be catalysts for us going forward.”
Chambers’ ACL tear and the graduation of the 2015 senior class proved to be too much to overcome as Harvard took a step back in 2015-2016. Fast-forward to 2017. Coinciding with the renovation of Lavietes Pavilion is another project. It remains to be seen how long this one will actually take. It began last year when Amaker brought in the most heralded recruiting class in league history to play alongside six underclassmen.
“Last year was a lot of adjusting, especially for us freshmen,” Towns said. “This year with our whole sophomore class, it’s trying to contribute and help into building our team. The leadership’s coming from everybody in all different kinds of angles. That was the main focus and that’s where our growth was.”
This season, and essentially the next three, will be based on the growth and development of this year’s sophomore class. While the seven second-years will have a different cast of supporting players around them for each of the next three seasons, it is truly their team at this point. The class is certainly talented enough to win the next three Ivy League championships. With a year of experience under their belts, the sophomores face the question of whether they can do the little things well and make the jump from a talented group of recruits to the core of an enduring NCAA Tournament team.
“One main thing is we have seven sophomores instead of seven freshmen,” Towns said. “I think that’s one of the biggest differences. I think with all of us freshmen last year having those roles and then translating into what we have now is really nice because there’s so much growth in everybody’s game.”
While the talent is there, the question of how far this team will go largely centers around execution and development. Last year’s freshmen played about as well as a crop of 18 and 19-year-olds can in today’s Ivy League. Aiken brought home Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors and was a first team All-Ivy pick. Towns was Harvard’s second-leading scorer, Justin Bassey emerged as the team’s top perimeter defender, and Chris Lewis started 23 games at center. Robert Baker, Christian Juzang, and Henry Welsh all saw meaningful minutes off the bench.
What set the Amaker teams that made four straight NCAA Tournaments apart was often their ability to execute and develop. They won games that they were supposed to win—the Crimson went 47-5 at home and picked up at least six wins over each Ivy foe over the four-year period.  Strong defense and an inside-out approach on the offensive end have been two characteristics of Harvard teams since Amaker has arrived in Cambridge. While the Crimson held opponents to 41.2 percent shooting from the field last season—which is in line with the percentages from 2011-2015—replacing Edosomwan as a physical defensive presence, excellent screen-setter, and rebounder will be key.
“I think [Lewis] has a chance to be one of the bigger keys for our team this season,” Amaker said. “Going back to the balance component, we talk about Lewis being kind of anchoring our frontline, being one of the interior guys for us. We certainly feel like the interior portion of our team could be the difference in how successful we are.”
Finally, the four NCAA Tournament teams could win close games. While Aiken has established himself as Harvard’s closer and was competitive in every game that it played last season, it struggled to win the close ones, dropping seven contests that were decided by four or fewer points.
“I think it’s obvious that he’s shown to be our best player,” Amaker said. “We need him to be who he’s capable of being, which is to be a dynamic, exciting guard that has confidence and can make shots in a lot of different ways.”
While recruiting services can project the scoring ability, defensive potential, and physical aspects of high school players, they are not as accurate when it comes to measuring when recruits will develop into the kinds of players that they were brought in to be. That’s where coaching, game experience, and preparation come in. Harvard’s sophomores showed flashes of what lies ahead for the program. The Crimson is talented enough to beat nearly every team on its schedule—the question is, will it?
The team’s rotation centers around its sophomore class. Aiken will be the team’s starting point guard and will likely be flanked by Bassey and junior sharpshooter Corey Johnson on the wings. Bassey will be a minutes eater and match up with the opposing team’s best offensive player. Johnson is the team’s best three-point shooter but struggled down the stretch last season, converting just five of his final 23 field goal attempts.
“I think he is in a great place, I think his mindset is very positive,” Amaker said. “He had a really good summer and really worked out hard as all of our guys did.”
Junior Tommy McCarthy and Juzang will battle for backup point guard minutes and freshman guard Mario Haskett figures to see some time on a wing, something which Towns and even Aiken may do.
In the frontcourt, Towns and Lewis will likely start at the four and five, respectively, but the team has a slew of big men with a wide range of skill sets. Welsh and captain Chris Egi are back-to-the-basket bigs while Robert Baker is a lanky 6’11” and can stretch the defense with his jump shot.
“I think it’s interesting throughout the season, especially in the Ivy League, you’re going to play some bruisers, you’re going to play some twos who play the four, so obviously having a huge variety of the guys on your team that you’re practicing with day in and day out, that prepares you for the games,” Egi said.
Junior forward Weisner Perez is undersized but is one of the team’s best rebounders and strongest players. Freshman forward Danilo Djuricic has been praised for his versatility, size, and shooting ability. The depth will be key not only for the team’s customary back-to-back conference games but also for its rigorous non-conference slate.
“We have a very challenging schedule, one that we are very excited about participating in, opportunities for us to play some of the best teams in the country, ranked teams on the road, holiday tournament with the Wooden Legacy, all really neat things for this team and our program as a whole,” Amaker said.
In addition to usual suspects like UMass, Holy Cross, Northeastern, Fordham, and Vermont, Harvard will square off with three teams that figure to make deep runs in March. The marquee matchup comes on Dec. 2 when Harvard travels to Rupp Arena to take on Kentucky. John Calipari’s roster boasts 7 five-star recruits and is ranked No. 5 in the AP preseason poll. The Crimson will also make the trip to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to take on a Minnesota team that returns six of its top seven scorers from a team that was a five seed in last season’s NCAA Tournament. Amir Coffey and Nate Mason make up one of the nation’s most dynamic backcourts. Additionally, Harvard will play in the Wooden Legacy, in which it will face a senior-laden St. Mary’s team that won 29 games a season ago. A strange twist to the Crimson’s schedule this year is that the team will play just four of its 15 nonconference games at home.
“It’s not easy, all this isn’t completely by design, we would love to have more home games but it has been difficult getting home games for people to be willing to play us here,” Amaker said. “It’s hard to win on the road, but if you can do that and show you are tough and confident and can execute in different environments, it will bode well for us overall [and] should give us some confidence in our conference.”
When the calendar switches over to 2018, Harvard will have its hands full with a loaded Ivy League. Penn finished last season as one of the hottest teams in the conference and returns its core from a team that topped both the Crimson and Elis down the stretch. Cornell and Dartmouth bring back two of the league’s best players in Matt Morgan and Evan Boudreaux, respectively. Harvard, Princeton, and Yale are the favorites to bring home the second annual Ivy League Tournament championship. The Tigers lose a lot of size and scoring ability from its frontcourt but brings back the three-headed monster of Amir Bell, Devin Cannady, and Myles Stephens.
“Princeton [is] obviously coming off of a tremendous year, historic year from them, losing some players but certainly when you have those kind of years, the confidence within your program, I would think, just going off experience with us, would be very high,” Amaker said.
However, the biggest hurdle to Ivy League supremacy for the Crimson likely resides in New Haven. The Bulldogs lose big man Sam Downey and will be small and thin in the frontcourt with 6’7” Blake Reynolds as the anchor. However, sophomores Miye Oni and Jordan Bruner proved to be program cornerstones as freshmen, junior Trey Phills is a steady hand on the wing, and junior guard Alex Copeland had his way with Harvard in each of the teams’ three matchups. Perhaps most importantly, Yale returns a healthy Makai Mason, the 2015-2016 Ivy League Player of the Year who won over hearts and minds in leading the Bulldogs to a 79-75 win in the 2016 NCAA Tournament.
Harvard and Yale are not particularly fond of one another and last season’s three matchups, including the showdown at the Palestra, did little to help. The Crimson certainly has the talent, depth, and size to topple the Bulldogs this time around and will look to do so on Jan. 26 in New Haven, Feb. 17 in Cambridge, and perhaps March 11 in Philadelphia. Whether this is the year that the dam breaks remains to be seen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It couldn’t have been drawn up any better—Harvard against Yale, Princeton against Penn. Winner takes all.
The outcome, though ultimately unsurprising, came with plenty of surprises along the way.
In the first-ever game of the inaugural men’s Ivy League tournament, No. 1-seeded Princeton, a team that had finished its conference slate undefeated, went into overtime against No. 4 Penn—a team that until the week before wasn’t sure if it would be competing, and entered the tournament with a losing record in conference.
An age-old battle for the conference was emerging at the Palestra. In stark contrast to the typical backdrop of the historic rivalry, however, the Quakers entered as a team that had snuck into a playoff game off of a buzzer-beater from sophomore guard Jackson Donahue a week earlier.
The Tigers ultimately prevailed, 72-66 in overtime, but surrounded by a crowd of Penn faithful, the Quakers looked more poised than they had all season long.
In the second matchup of the tournament, the Crimson took on a Bulldog squad that it had downed twice that season.
In their first regular season matchup, Harvard and Yale traded shots for much of the night. A then-career-high 27 points from freshman guard Bryce Aiken ultimately gave the Crimson the win, handing the Bulldogs their first home loss in nearly two years. In their second meeting, a 46-point second half gave Harvard a dominant win at home.
In another era, the only time that two Ancient Eight teams would have faced off for a third time in a single season was if they finished atop the league with the same record—the odds that one of those teams had swept the other in the regular season was near zero.
Then again, in another era, the second and third best teams in the conference wouldn’t be playing basketball this late in March.
Prior to that game, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker recognized this.
“We finished second,” Amaker said. “I feel for Princeton at this time, for obviously having a sensational year, going undefeated in the conference, and now obviously we have the tournament, but we understood that going into it.”
Nonetheless, the Crimson took on Yale for the third time on the season and much like the old adage would imply, the third time was in fact the charm for the Bulldogs. Despite a career-high 28 points from Aiken, the rest of the team simply couldn’t find the net for much of the night.
Despite pulling within three with just over a minute on the clock, a late turnover would prove to be the nail in the coffin. The Crimson dropped its first game of the inaugural Ivy League tournament, 73-71.
For the Crimson, the loss was disheartening at best—after losing to Princeton on buzzer-beaters twice in the regular season, Harvard could only watch from the sidelines as the Tigers beat Yale on Sunday. As expected, and just as well-deserved, Princeton was going to the Big Dance.
In a conference known best for its age-old traditions and schools, the Ivy League was fairly late to the game—in fact, it was dead last. Of the 32 conferences in Division I basketball, the Ancient Eight was the last to implement a conference tournament.
Even with some imperfections, the conference tournament has brought about significant changes to the Ivy League. Beyond an abundance of storylines at the tournament itself, it has brought significance to what were often irrelevant games late in the Ivy season.
“[Penn] started off 0-5 in the league,” Amaker said. “I’m not sure that in years past or in previous years that a team like that would stay that hungry for an opportunity to be in postseason because it probably wouldn’t be there for them more than likely.”
Whereas the bottom feeders of the league would usually be playing for pride, as the last week of the season approached, every team in the conference had something at stake.
“I was told, through the last weekend, [mathematically] maybe every team was still in play for the top four seeds,” Amaker said. “I do think that it makes for interesting drama and I do think that it makes for interesting opportunities for all the teams in our conference to finish in that top four to make postseason.”
On pretty much every front, the conference tournament brought a dimension of excitement usually absent from the long haul of the Ivy League season.
As the Crimson returns for another season, the loss in the conference tournament has rekindled a rivalry with the Bulldogs absent since Harvard downed Yale in a one-game playoff for the conference’s automatic bid in 2015.
“We just want to win,” sophomore forward Seth Towns said. “Last year we went out with a bad taste in our mouths.”
Captain Chris Egi expressed similar thoughts.
“I think a lot of good things can come out of a bad moment like that, and I think hopefully that’s what comes out of that,” Egi said. “Having that desire to never feel like that again.”
While it has certainly brought about a degree of excitement previously absent from the Ivy League season, the conference tournament isn’t without its doubters—in particular, the venue of the tournament presents some problems when it comes to the question of homecourt advantage. Had a Penn squad with a losing record in conference beat an undefeated Princeton team at the Palestra that Saturday, the easy scapegoat would’ve been the venue.
With the tournament set to be at the Palestra this season as well, and as the four teams tabbed to finish atop the conference are Harvard, Penn, Princeton and Yale, the question of the Palestra might just come back up in March. As it is, however, Amaker believes that it would be difficult to find a better alternative.
“My opinion of having it in the Palestra, I don’t know that everyone in our league feels the way that I feel but I think that’s been a very wise, smart move,” Amaker said. “Such a terrific, historic facility within our conference. It’s one of the great venues for college basketball and we have it in the Ivy League. I know how that affects certain teams and home court advantage and all different things but it’s never going to be a perfect scenario in my opinion so I’ve been in favor of the Palestra being the site for our conference tournament.”
While the tournament has already come to define the way that Amaker looks at his team moving forward. Arguably for the better, the advent of the conference tournament has changed the trajectory and the collective memory of a season in the Ivy League.
“We’re going to look back and these are the moments that really kind of made us,” Amaker said, referencing the loss to Yale last season. “There are moments when it’s gut-wrenching time, and boy, you came up short and it drives you at times to propel you, it’s the catalyst to be better, to do better. What can you do to help? What can you do to be better next time?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team once again did something it rarely does. Except this time, it wasn’t a good thing. After going unbeaten in Cambridge last season, the Crimson finally lost a home match.
With Ivy League rival Yale in town, the Crimson (1-1-0, 1-1-0 ECAC) allowed two opening period goals for the first time since January 13th of last season against RPI. That year, in 36 games, Harvard relinquished a pair of first period scores just three times.
The Crimson ultimately fell to the Bulldogs, 5-2, registering its first defeat of the young 2017-2018 campaign. The effort to come from behind would have been an impressive—and rare—feat. The last time Harvard came back from a two-goal deficit was February 11th, 2013 against Boston University in the Beanpot consolation match.
“We didn’t get a penalty kill when we needed one, we didn’t get a big save when we needed one,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We turned the puck over way too many times, and Yale deserves a lot of credit for all of that.”
From the time the Bulldogs (2-1-0, 2-1-0) potted their second goal, courtesy of sophomore forward Robbie DeMontis, the Crimson was fighting an uphill battle—an unfamiliar feeling for coach Donato and company.
“Yale made us play more defense than we’ve played this year,” coach Donato said. “We have to be more comfortable playing defense in our own zone…without taking penalties.”
As the bench boss alluded to, a slew of infractions toward the end of the game stunted Harvard’s attempt to claw back from a two-goal deficit, which the Crimson found itself in due to defensive-zone turnovers. Tri-captain Jake Horton ended his night with a game misconduct for boarding a defenseless Yale player.
Trailing 2-0 at the start of the second frame, Harvard quickly tilted the ice back in its favor and, before long, equalized the contest. To get things going offensively, the Crimson looked no further than forward centerpiece, junior Ryan Donato.
Possessing the puck at the red line, Donato skated into the zone before fending off a backchecking defender. With his hands free, the Boston Bruins prospect took the puck down low before flipping a slick two-foot saucer pass to a crashing Jake Horton. The tri-captain buried the biscuit.
Just three minutes later on the power play, Harvard evened the game in a strikingly similar way. This time, sophomore blue-liner Adam Fox, sly as always, skated down the left wall. When he got to the goal line, last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year cut inward and fed junior Lewis Zerter-Gossage, who sniped the top-left corner on Yale goaltender Sam Tucker.
After the equalizer, fans were roaring inside Bright-Landry Hockey Center. These roars, however, soon turned to whispers.
“I thought [in] the second period, we actually played pretty well,” coach Donato said. “I think we beat ourselves to a certain extent…. We didn’t make the plays at the key points in the game to give ourselves a chance.”
Two minutes after the Zerter-Gossage tally, the Bulldogs answered. Trying to hold the puck at the blue line, freshman defenseman Benjamin Foley lost his footing, allowing a two-on-one to head the other way.
“Too many times we put the game’s fate in a bad spot,” coach Donato said. “We got it back to 2-2, we had some chances, it looked like we were ready to really get on top of them a little bit, but we…made multiple mistakes.”
DeMontis flew toward Crimson tri-captain Merrick Madsen in net. About to be caught by a diving Harvard player, DeMontis shifted the puck across the blue line to fellow sophomore Luke Stevens, who untangled himself from a backchecking Reilly Walsh and slipped the puck past Madsen.
“The longer you play hockey, the more you realize that stuff happens,” said coach Donato, in reference to Foley’s slip. “It’s a bad bounce, he catches an edge…. Instead of trying to put somebody under the spotlight, it’s a great chance to rally around a teammate and say, ‘Hey, we got a bad bounce, but that’s not going to beat us tonight.’”
By this point, Crimson players were engaging in the post-whistle shoving and chirping fans are accustomed to seeing between these two storied rivals. Prior to the contest, Harvard hoped to stick to its game and not get too involved after the whistle.
“At the end of the day, we’re focused on playing in between the whistles, and not trying to worry about…scrums or little fisticuffs with [Yale],” said tri-captain Eddie Ellis on Wednesday.

This roughhousing quickly backfired for the Crimson, who took multiple penalties in the third period.
“The game was tied 2-2…[and] I thought we actually played some pretty good hockey and had the game in a pretty good spot,” coach Donato said. “We make the mistake and then we give up the power play goal.”
With the energy ramped up, play continued for another ten minutes before Yale added a cushion goal on the power play. This time, the culprit was captain Ryan Hitchcock, with the Bulldogs’ 2016-2017 scoring leader Joe Snively picking up his first point of the new campaign.
Despite outshooting Yale 35-26, the Crimson couldn’t solve Tucker enough times to keep pace with the Bulldog attack. DeMontis left Cambridge on Friday night with the Tim Taylor Cup, awarded to the most outstanding player in the annual Harvard-Yale game hosted by the Crimson.
Harvard will have one more chance to prepare for its impending nine-game road stretch in Saturday’s bout with Brown.
“At the end of the year, you want to be playing your best hockey,” said sophomore forward Nathan Krusko. “Whether it’s getting certain kinks out of the way early on in the season, working out some systems, changing up lines, making sure we have the right chemistry going on—that’s some of the stuff you’re going to see.”

Everyone's favorite “let’s get lunch” (but not actually ever) lunch spot has been seized. Market in the Square's seizure poses problems—problems that you may not have realized you even had yet. We’re here to break the sad news to you.
Reduction in Square Diversity 
The loss of a restaurant in the Square not named "Felipe's" or "El Jefe's" is especially troubling. The list of non-Mexican Subway-esque eateries to visit at 2 a.m. has been reduced by one. The list now stands at two, and we may die if we eat at Nocch's or Tasty another time this semester.
Loss of a Mildly Adultlike Date Option
Asking someone to get lunch at Market conveyed that you wanted your date to see you in a setting that wasn't a JP Licks or a Felipe's. You probably chose Market to seem mildly cultured, and you succeeded. It wasn't as pricey or serious as Spice, but it was less juvenile than Noch's. Good luck finding that culinary sweet spot now.Introduction of a Half-Block Walk of Sadness
Some never ate at Market. Some lived at Market. We all can only move on now and pray that another Clover does not move in.
