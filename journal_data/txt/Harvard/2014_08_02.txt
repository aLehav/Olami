After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Vice President of Advancement for the University of Alberta O’Neil A.S. Outar will take over as the new senior associate dean and director of development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a shift in leadership that comes nearly a year after the FAS launched its campaign for the Arts and Sciences.
Outar, who will officially assume his dual positions on Sept. 8, will manage and advise FAS fundraising efforts, working to meet and exceed the division’s $2.5 billion capital campaign, according to a press release last Friday. That figure represents a plurality of The Harvard Campaign’s University-wide $6.5 billion goal, the highest ever set by an institution of higher education.
“Initially, as with any new position, my priority will be to learn as much as I can,” Outar wrote in an email. “I'll listen a lot and ask a ton of questions.”
He added that he hopes to “continue [the] momentum” already generated by the FAS campaign.
Outar will replace Paul T. Keenan ’85, who has served in the role since 2008, when the University’s Development Office underwent several major changes, adding new roles and bulking up its fundraising arm.
FAS spokesperson Colin Manning wrote in an email that, on June 30, Keenan relocated to Honolulu, Hawaii, where Keenan’s partner is CEO of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation. There he will be working in his own firm, Keenan Associates, which consults with universities and non-profit organizations. Keenan will still maintain a consulting relationship with Harvard, Manning said.
According to the press release, Outar will report directly to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74, under whom he will join the Alumni Affairs and Development senior team.
“His deep experience and strong skills will be invaluable,” Rogers said in the press release.
Dean Smith, for his part, said he is not worried  that the shift in leadership will threaten the campaign's momentum.
“O'Neil is ready and eager to join us and build on the incredible momentum we've built in the campaign's first year," Smith said in a statement.
Previously, Outar served as the University of Alberta’s first-ever Vice President of Management, raising half a billion dollars during his four-year tenure at the school. Prior to working at the University of Alberta, Outar served as MIT’s senior director of global initiatives and senior director of institutional initiatives.
“O'Neil is a consummate professional, a high energy, strategic, thoughtful and brilliant leader,” Colm Renehan, who served as associate vice president on Outar’s team at the University of Alberta, wrote in an email. “He is a great catch for a world leading university and we will miss him dearly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 7, 2014, at 10:12 a.m.
Former Washington Governor Christine Gregoire and Valerie Biden Owens, the sister and campaign strategist of Vice President Joe Biden, are among the class of six fall semester fellows announced Wednesday by the Institute of Politics.
The fellows, who will lead study groups for undergraduates and community members, and attend other events on campus, also include two members of the media, Kristen Soltis Anderson, a columnist at The Daily Beast, and Phil Kent, the former CEO of Turner Broadcasting Systems.Frank Fahrenkopf, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Anton J. Gunn, a health care consultant who managed public affairs for President Obama’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, round out the rest of this fall’s class.
The fellows are selected by the staff of the IOP and a student advisory committee, according to Eric R. Anderson, the director of the IOP fellows program.
“The fellows are a resource to students—that’s their number one mission,” Anderson said, pointing to the diversity of this year’s fellows and the program’s efforts to provide programming that appeals to a broad range of undergraduates.
In addition to the weekly study groups, fellows hold office hours for four hours each week and often attend classes or club meetings.
For Frank J. Fahrenkopf, who is also the co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the fellowship is an opportunity to connect with and learn from students, he said.
"It gives me an opportunity to get to know the issues that are important on the Harvard Campus," Fahrenkopf said. “My wife and I are looking forward to it."
After two weeks of orientation to the campus, fellows will begin hosting their weekly study groups on Sept. 22, according to Anderson.
Those entering the fellowship view the program as an opportunity to give back and inspire a new generation of leaders, Gunn said.
“I want to pay it forward and invest in the next generation of leadership,” he said. “I’m very excited about being a part of this tradition...of getting young people involved in public service.”
