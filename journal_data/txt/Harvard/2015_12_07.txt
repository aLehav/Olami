After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s crusade to make final clubs go co-ed must seem a remarkable success in its eyes. This year two of the all-male clubs accepted their first female members. And despite indignation from some, if the College continues to “force hands,” it appears that the eventual compliance of all eight male clubs might be inevitable, whether that’s five, ten, or 25 years down the line.
But within this grand solution lies a larger problem for Harvard—and that’s fraternities. Full disclosure: I’m part of an all-male fraternity on campus myself.
Momentarily disregard single-sex organizations like the Black and Asian Student Associations, which have cultural purposes, and Harvard’s five female final clubs, which lack the same saga around sexism and sexual assault. In line with the College’s discernible vision, a day will come when all of the once-male final clubs are co-ed, and the College will next have to decide whether to go after its five fraternities. Neither choice will be pretty.
If the College looks past fraternities as single-sex organizations, it’s an abandonment of principle. The College has confronted final clubs in the name of equalizing campus social spaces among sexes. And yes, final clubs have grander houses, bigger parties, and more tainted slates than the fraternities on campus. But both types of groups are fundamentally similar: They mix with sororities, host parties, and hold brotherhood events.
After all, many of the final clubs evolved out of fraternity chapters (the Delphic Club from Delta Phi; the AD club from Alpha Delta Phi; the Spee Club from Zeta Psi). Failing to follow up with the fraternities would be nothing short of blatant hypocrisy.
But now let’s say Harvard stands by its principles and goes after fraternities with the same pressure to go co-ed. Herein lies the biggest problem.
Fraternities have tremendous power in the US. FratPAC, the political action committee representing Greek life interests, spent almost half a million dollars in the off-peak 2014 election cycle alone. The North American Fraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference, the country’s largest umbrella organizations of fraternities and sororities, recently hired a former US senator to lobby against a bill in Congress that would limit colleges’ abilities to punish students accused of sexual assault.
Just as important, Greek organizations have alumni with influence. Historically, 85 percent of Fortune 500 executives, 71 percent of the men in “Who’s Who in America,” and 76 percent of US senators were in college fraternities.
If Harvard hates anything, it’s a drop of bad press. In this case, Harvard would be weathering itself for a storm—one that’s head and shoulders above the capacity of the oft-fabled final club graduate boards. Legal experts can agree all they want that Harvard, as a private university, can limit students’ associations. Several smaller schools like Amherst College have tried banning students from joining fraternities, with results to be seen. But legality doesn’t mean practicality.
One Atlantic piece put it, “This is why—to answer the vexing question ‘why don’t colleges just get rid of their bad fraternities?’—the system, and its individual frats, have only grown in power and influence. Indeed, in many substantive ways, fraternities are now mightier than the colleges and universities that host them.”
This isn’t an argument about whether Harvard’s final clubs and fraternities should go co-ed. There are strong arguments on both sides for the freedom of association and for more inclusive social spaces on campus. This is an argument that the College’s campaign to make final clubs go co-ed might be a battle not worth picking, or at least one with larger consequences than Harvard suspects.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days after black tape was found placed across the portraits of African-American Harvard Law School professors, the national conversation about race on college campuses continued to make itself known at Harvard. One of its more troubling manifestations was the appearance of a Facebook page called the “White Student Union at Harvard University,” a group claiming to “defend the inherent rights of White Europeans.” Understandably, the page has caused alarm among students and administrators.
Similar cases of white student union Facebook groups have cropped up at more than 30 universities nationwide—some hoaxes, others perhaps not. The Harvard page’s origins are still unclear. Though the page administrator posted pictures of an anonymous student ID and flyers in the Yard, the involvement of Harvard students is still unconfirmed, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has said that the Office of the General Counsel is investigating. Regardless of whether Harvard students are involved, the page’s creation is disturbing and should serve as a further opportunity to explore the issues that have recently dominated college campuses around the country.
Neither intellectually nor historically does the premise of a white student union make sense. Organizations based on ethnic and cultural traditions already exist in large numbers at Harvard. Often, these groups both celebrate heritage and provide space for historically marginalized groups to grapple with a broad range of issues. Several groups listed as “cultural and racial initiatives” on the Office of Student Life’s website are already concerned with ethnic and cultural traditions with European roots. The problem with the “White Student Union” is that its purpose is to oppose another movement, and in doing so to reaffirm harmful ideas of supremacy and separation. The Facebook page, with an “All Lives Matter” graphic as its profile picture, defines the group in opposition to “incessant lies spread about our people by the Black Lives Matter movement”—a bizarre, baseless characterization of a racial justice movement.
Further underscoring the intellectual bankruptcy of its message is the Facebook page’s links to the online magazine American Renaissance. The magazine, which focuses on issues of race in the United States, calls its ideology “race realism,” but it has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and described as the product of a “white supremacist think tank” by the Anti-Defamation League. A writer for an SPLC publication has said that the magazine’s founding editor “is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen.”
In short, the “White Students Union” has addressed itself to a non-existent problem, defined itself in opposition to productive engagement with race, and advertised its intellectual debt to hate groups. If they have succeeded in anything, the Facebook page and the broader backlash against frank discussions of racism of which it is a part have only underscored the need for these conversations, including at Harvard. These discussions will require respect, historical sense, and open-minds—attributes at the core of Harvard’s values, and conspicuously lacking on the controversial Facebook page.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At what point in your Harvard education do you learn to serve someone other than yourself?
What General Education requirement ensures that students prioritize values like compassion and humility? Which school mantra, tradition, song, or mission statement implores you to sacrifice self-interest for charity?
How, in general, do Harvard kids learn to be good people and not just powerful ones?
For me, these are tricky questions because there are no concrete answers. Harvard may provide the most rigorous academic education in the world, but in a structural sense—in the way the college builds communities and manages traditions—it hardly provides a moral education.
This shortcoming is especially dangerous for an institution that pumps out so many influential figures. From John Adams to John F. Kennedy, five presidents have gone through the undergraduate program, more than any other college. Harvard has dished out a total of 65 degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs; the closest competitor is Stanford, which has awarded 27.
It’s no exaggeration to say that every year, Harvard educates people who will change the world. Surely the college ought to mount a gale-force effort to strengthen the integrity of these students—to motivate future leaders to lead in the right direction.
Instead, Harvard as an institution has refused to make moral education a defining feature of the undergraduate experience. In particular the university lacks a well-publicized set of life values, has no administrative program intended to strengthen the empathy of students, and does little to persuade the undergraduate body to use its prodigious gifts for a just purpose.
The sort of moral education that I have in mind requires an atmosphere that is saturated with compassionate values. Values like an impulse to serve the interests of others; a broad recognition of common humanity despite surface-level differences; a willingness to love before being loved.
How do you create this atmosphere? The simplest and most effective way is by formulating a clear set of moral stances, such as “Love your neighbor as yourself,” and repeating them frequently enough until people start to internalize them and live through imitation.
Well, I’ve spent a year as an undergraduate, and I still have no idea what basic ethical principles underpin my education at Harvard.
Before searching on the Internet, for instance, I didn’t know that my college had a stated mission. This hidden text spends most of the time discussing “intellectual transformation” and admits only a lukewarm hope that students will be “learning how they can best serve the world.”
By contrast, I do know the lyrics to “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.” This song details sporting conquests and instills absolutely nothing besides bravado. Not a bad attitude if you’ve just won your eighth straight game, but hardly a philosophy to order your life.
I also know the motto of my school: “Veritas.” It’s a powerful reminder that I’m participating in a millennia-long struggle for understanding. It also says nothing about kindness.
After one year and countless orientation sessions, I can remember only a handful of times that Harvard administrators reminded me that charity matters. I’ve been listening, but I still don’t understand exactly how my college plans to shape me into a more loving person.
In place of the institution, my friends have filled this role. Any moral growth that I have experienced has come through interactions with them—talking through issues with them, watching them care about other students, remembering to do the same myself.
This isn’t good enough. I’m attending college in the hopes of developing into a more rounded person; growing in love and humility is as much a part of this development as growing in wisdom.
Besides creating and reinforcing a set of university-wide maxims, Harvard administrators could, in their regular outreach to students, stress the importance of taking care of others, not just yourself. Too often this message only appears in the aftermath of a tragedy.
More basically the University could stand tall and stick to the position that there are right ways to use a Harvard degree, and there are wrong ways. Part of going to a place like this one is figuring out how to untangle your educational privilege.
Perhaps there are reasons that Harvard doesn’t take on a more active role as a promoter of morality. After all, the college aims to teach critical inquiry and active questioning, which may seem antithetical to aphoristic propaganda.
But this logic lacks the understanding that humble service is a universal virtue. Championing kindness doesn’t undermine analytical thinking; it doesn’t offend diversity.
There are lots of mistakes you can make at Harvard—drinking too much, studying too little, or picking the wrong extracurriculars—but the only way you can truly fail is to abandon compassion.
This is a message that all college students ought to hear again and again, but Harvard’s administration has failed to deliver it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the third community meeting on race relations at Harvard Law School in as many weeks on Friday, students called on Law School Dean Martha L. Minow to produce a “strategic plan” to implement student demands they say will improve the school’s treatment of minority students by 9 a.m. on Monday.
 On Friday afternoon, hundreds of Law School students—many of them dressed in all black—piled into Milstein East Hall to continue an ongoing conversation about racism at the school that has intensified in the weeks since a racially charged incident rocked the campus. Police are investigating that incident, involving pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black faculty members, as a hate crime.
A group of students stood up one by one to microphones on Friday and presented a series of demands to Minow and other administrators present. Students have also launched a website, dubbed “Reclaim Harvard Law School,” outlining their demands in extensive detail.
The students are reiterating some previous student demands, such as calling on Harvard to change the Law School’s seal, which students have criticized for its connection to a slaveholding family. They are also asking the school to establish an office devoted to issues of diversity and inclusion, require staff members to go through “cultural competency” training, and lower tuition and expand financial aid to “improve affordability and financial access to HLS for students of color, students from low socio-economic backgrounds, and otherwise marginalized students.”
Addressing issues of faculty hiring, the students have demanded that Harvard prioritize recruiting and promoting more minority staff members. They also want to see changes to the Law School’s curriculum:  They call for a program in critical race theory with its own faculty, supported by at least $5 million, and structural changes to the general legal curriculum to “ensure the integration of marginalized narratives and a serious study into the implications of racism, white supremacy, and imperialism in creating and perpetuating legal analysis and thought.”
Lastly, they are calling on the Law School to form a committee tasked with overseeing the implementation of their demands. 
Minow, who listened as students read their demands on Friday, has faced criticism this month for what activists say is a sometimes unwelcoming environment for minority students at her school. She has already taken several steps to respond to some of the student demands and formulated her own plans to improve race relations at the schools.  She has appointed a committee to consider changing the school’s seal, which she said last Monday would require the Harvard Corporation’s approval; administrators have also said they will work to create a more diverse faculty and hire a staff member to focus on diversity issues.
Still, Minow has faced pushback from some students. At a similar community meeting convened to discuss race at the school last Monday, several students criticized Minow for not giving them more time to air their views. She spent much of the Monday meeting discussing her own plans for change and scheduled Friday’s meeting as a follow-up.
On Friday, however, Minow primarily watched and listened as students spoke. “Thinking, listening, thank you,” she said, after Leland S. Shelton, the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, reiterated each demand and asked if she was prepared to immediately agree to any of them. 
Some students were frustrated that she did not give a lengthier response to the presented demands.
“At the end of the day, with a community meeting, if it’s going to be a dialogue it needs to have some sort of response from the administration,” said Shay N. Johnson, a third-year Law student. “We feel as though she will not speak on these issues, which is unacceptable because she needs to establish a clear stance on it.”
Still, not all students agreed. William H. Barlow, a third-year Law student, stepped up to the microphone Friday “to offer a voice of dissent.” Praising the administration’s response to the tape incident, Barlow said the administration has “adopted policies to try to fix the problems here.”
“I think that too often, we, instead of wanting solutions, want to be angry,” he said.
In an email sent to Law School affiliates on Friday, Minow wrote that she will carefully consider the student demands.
“I listened carefully,” Minow wrote. “I will do my best to ensure that we find ways to work together, joining students, staff, and faculty to address proposals and above all to strengthen this School and its possibilities to be better and to make the world better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bianca Mulaney ’16 and Rebecca M. Panovka ’16, friends and fellow Quincy House residents, have been named Harvard’s two newest Marshall scholars to their shared surprise and disbelief.
As scholars on the postgraduate award—which funds up to 40 U.S. undergraduates to study for at least two years at institutions in the United Kingdom—the two will continue researching topics in line with their undergraduate interests.
Mulaney, who is from Florida, is an Economics concentrator interested in the relationship between antibiotic resistance and agriculture.  She will spend one year studying at the London School of Economics and Political Science and another year studying infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
From New York, Panovka is a joint concentrator  in English and Philosophy who will pursue a Master of Philosophy in political thought and intellectual history at Cambridge University for her first year. In her second year, Panovka intends earn a master's degree in visual anthropology at the University of Manchester.
The two recipients prepared together by conducting mock interviews with each other, and both expressed a sense of shock and gratitude at receiving the scholarship.
“I’m in disbelief that I was selected given how many incredibly qualified candidates there were,” Mulaney said.
Mulaney said her involvement in biology labs and multiple extracurricular organizations, such as the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum and Smart Women Securities, helped cultivate her research interests.
Karine A. Gibbs ’00, an associate professor in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Mulaney’s biochemical sciences tutor, said she was proud of Mulaney’s selection for the scholarship.
“Bianca’s really a firecracker,” said Gibbs. “She is incredibly motivated, she thinks outside the box…she’s really passionate about her interests.”
Panovka said her personal interest in filmmaking piqued last summer when she worked for a filmmaker in South Africa. She also interned at The Paris Review, Radio Open Source, and several other media organizations, and is a member of the Harvard Advocate and Signet Society.
Panovka said she looks forward to using the scholarship as a way to “grow, both as a thinker and as a filmmaker.”
Maria Tatar, a Germanic Languages and Literatures professor who has served as a mentor to Panovka, said she “almost fell off my chair with glee” when she found out Panovka had won the scholarship.
“Rebecca is an intellectually adventurous student and a focused self-starter when it comes to research,” Tatar said. “The fit with the Marshall Scholarship seemed exactly right.”
Both award recipients expressed their excitement at being able to study in England after graduation.
“I’m so thrilled that we’ll get to share this experience with each other,” Panovka said.

UPDATED: December 7, 2015, at 1:25 p.m.
Forty-eight Harvard seniors have been elected to the College's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, joining the 24 members of the Class of 2016 who were selected for the honor society this spring.
Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, and selects inductees who have demonstrated academic excellence as well as difficulty and variety of course load based on transcripts and official recommendations from Harvard advisors.
The new members were inducted during a ceremony on Wednesday. Their names were released Friday by Jeffrey Berg, assistant director at the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships. This year’s Senior 48 hail from all 12 of Harvard’s houses, with the strongest contingent from Mather House at eight.
For many, the news came as a culmination — and an official acknowledgement of — years of hard work.
“I’ve taken a lot of upper level Latin and Greek courses, and I finally felt that all the hours I had been pouring over ancient texts, reading all this commentary on classic authors, I finally felt that that was sort of recognized by the University,” said Tyler A. Dobbs ’16 of Lowell house, who was the only Classics concentrator to receive the election this year.
“I love the ancients, I think they have a lot of wisdom to offer us today,” Dobbs said. “I’m very happy to promote them and represent them in PBK.”
Some students, like Audrey B. Carson ’16, a Government concentrator from Kirkland House, said that induction into the chapter was “humbling.”
“These are people I might never see on campus—we come from all different houses, all different concentrations,” Carson said. “To have this group pulled together, people that have really committed to their studies, that are passionate about their concentrations, is really special.”
The induction ceremony “felt like a high-powered bunch,” she added.
“I think that a lot of people at Harvard deserve something like this, so I feel lucky,” said Ramya Rangan ’16, a Computer Science concentrator from Currier House.
Economics was the most widely represented concentration among this year’s inductees, whose distribution across concentrations is roughly proportional to overall numbers of concentrators in each field.
“It was exciting for me to have been selected to be to be a member of PBK with some of my closest friends from the Economics concentration,” said Auden S. Laurence ’16, an Economics concentrator from Adams House. “That was a real honor and a special moment to be inducted with two of them.”

An award-winning author who is also a former NBA star and local community members gathered to discuss the importance of humanism at the third annual Humanist Community Day at the Humanist Hub on Sunday.
The event featured keynote addresses by John U. E. Amaechi, a former NBA player who came out as gay after his career in a best selling book, and Sasha Sagan, a writer and film producer. Gregory M. Epstein, the University’s Humanist Chaplain and the executive director of the Humanist Hub, presented the Humanist of the Year award to Amaechi.
The Humanist Hub is a Cambridge-based initiative committed to helping people lead ethical lives outside the sphere of religion. Founded in 1974 as the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, the organization now serves humanists, atheists, and agnostics at the University as well as in the Boston community, according to its website.
“This event is also for the Harvard community and Cambridge community to know what humanism is—to connect, act, and to contribute more to the world… not necessarily in a religious context,” said Erik M. Gregory, a member of the Humanist Hub.
This conference coincided with the second anniversary of the Humanist Hub. At its opening two years ago, former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 declared December 8 to be “Humanist Community Day.” Since then, the local Humanist community has grown tremendously in size and mission, according to Sarah Chandonnet, an organizer of the conference.
The growing community has attracted people like local resident Ben Datema, who knew “not a soul” in Boston when he moved here two years ago.
“I came to the Hub, and since then have gotten involved in a lot of programs and efforts to make the world a better place,” said Datema, who volunteered at the event.
During their keynote speeches, Amaechi and Sagan shared their own understandings of humanism. To Amaechi, humanism means being “present, attentive, and mindful” of how one’s behaviors can affect others. Sagan said humanism is a philosophy that can redefine a person’s outlook on the world.
“Humanism is about…the spine-tingling chill that you get when you get a sense of your place in the universe,” she said.

The line stretched out the door of the Harvard Museum of Natural History on Saturday for Matthew Kaplan’s lecture on the “Science of the Magical," which explored scientific realities of modern and ancient mythology and drew a crowd of more than 150 people.
Kaplan, a science correspondent for The Economist, spoke to a packed auditorium about his most recent book, "The Science of the Magical." His research focused heavily on the intersection of folklore and mythology and the sciences.
“Science is so often ignorant of folklore and mythology because they don’t study it,” he said referencing the disparity between the size of Harvard’s Folklore and Mythology department and that of the multiple departments in science.
Kaplan focused on Assyrian legends as well as on myths from the Vikings, ancient Greeks, and the Renaissance. He mentioned scenes from Harry Potter as well. He used these stories to illuminate traces of scientific truth in myth.
“Way, way back when, it was the habit of our ancestors to cut open a goat or sheep and look at the liver to decide, ‘Hmm, is Uncle Petroneus to survive this current bout of disease?’” Kaplan said, pointing to an image of an ancient sculpture of a liver. “To someone trained in sciences, this seems absolutely preposterous.”
Kaplan said that the practice dated back to the Assyrians, who would slaughter goats and examine their livers to decide if a field was suitable for farming. He contacted Bruce A. Rideout, a veterinary pathologist at the San Diego Zoo, to ask if the liver of a goat could possibly show anything about the field that the goat inhabited.
Kaplan summarized Rideout’s analysis. “Livers are a lot like tree rings, if you look at the liver of an animal it tells you about its historic bouts with disease, drought, and other nasty conditions,” he said.
Kaplan’s lecture also capped off a successful semester’s worth of talks at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. According to Director of Public Programs for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture Diana X. Munn, the attendance at this lecture was twice the usual size.
“This is twice as much as we usually get in the fall semester,” said Munn. “We’ve had really awesome programs.”

Residents of Cambridge ushered in the holiday season with a visit to the festively decorated home of renowned American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow on Friday evening.
The fourth annual event featured tours of the estate and craft tables for making Christmas cards and Victorian-era fashion dolls. Within the historic space, the artifacts showcased for display were themed in accordance with the holiday season. Longfellow House on Brattle Street also served as George Washington’s headquarters during the Revolutionary War’s siege of Boston.
“This house has an amazing collection,” said Garrett Cloer, a park ranger and volunteer coordinator at the Longfellow House. “Everything in it belonged to members of the Longfellow family and we have special holiday-related things... So there’s a lot of gifts, toys, there’s letters to and from Santa Claus.”
With a small staff of only six people, the Longfellow House relied heavily upon collaboration between employees from different branches of the National Park Service within Massachusetts along with the efforts of many volunteers to put the event together, according to Cloer.
“We have everybody from the archives staff, the museum collections staff, and we also have people from the national park sites in Brookline that we’re affiliated with, that come over and help us out for this program,” Cloer said. “It’s a big endeavor for our site.”
Volunteers and attendees alike said they enjoyed the family atmosphere and the festive spirit.
“It’s a great event for the kids,” said Karen H. Avery, who attended with her family.
Adrienne L. Sharigian, a volunteer from the Olmsted national historic site, said she was excited “to see this event in action.”
“It’s nice to see the house and the surrounding landscape decorated for the holidays,” she added.

In the Undergraduate Council’s last meeting this semester, representatives narrowly voted to continue funding the calendar application Ventfull, with many calling the initiative—which the council's outgoing leaders have touted as an accomplishment—a failed program.
During lengthy debate on legislation that would allot $1,200 from the Council’s budget to continue funding the application, several representatives criticized spending funds on an initiative that they said is unpopular and underutilized. The online application, called Ventfull, was a chief campaign plank for outgoing UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16. The application aggregates event times and locations and displays them for undergraduate subscribers.
The UC currently funds the application, although College administrators may fund the program if it meets certain benchmarks next semester, Goyal said.
Goyal said he and Nasrollahzadeh first introduced the initiative to bridge “information asymmetry” between undergraduates and allow students to attend a variety of open events. He and Nasrollahzadeh vigorously defended the application and said the Council could take future action to study undergraduate perception of it.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal joined 24 other representatives in voting to continue funding Ventful. But many of the  14 members—an unusual strength of opposition for a Council that typically affirms legislation—who voted against the measure called the program a poor use of UC resources.
“Ventfull seems like a pretty big failure in my mind,” said Isaac G. Inkeles ’16, a Leverett House representative. “I think the demand doesn’t really exist, and we’d be putting money into a sunken ship.”
“We have numbers again that show that it’s not very popular,” Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17 said at the meeting. Levine, who is an inactive Crimson writer, displayed the application’s web platform during an opposition speech, highlighting the low number of “up-votes” on each of the calendar’s events. 
Adams House representative Scott Ely ’18 said the application was a “small failure” of Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal’s term.
Representatives who supported continuing the program, however, said that representatives still need to research the utility of the program before cutting off funds. Incoming UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 suggested forming a focus group to study the application next this semester. Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal  said earlier this semester that a surge of undergraduates used Ventfull during Opening Days, an events-heavy orientation period for freshmen.
Four UC representatives abstained from voting on the funding proposal.
Also at the meeting, Rather and incoming UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 assumed the Council’s top offices after swearing—hands flush against a digital tablet—to uphold the UC’s bylaws and constitution. Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, clad in a courtly robe and white wig, officiated the ceremony.
Representatives also elected Lowell House representative Samarth Gupta ’18 as the Council’s incoming treasurer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 7, 2015, at 1:21 p.m.
Former Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights program coordinator Tessa Lowinske Desmond urged attendees at an open discussion on Friday to appeal to the Harvard administration to create a formal academic program in Asian and Pacific American studies.
Desmond, speaking at the invitation of two students who organized the event, made remarks following a two-hour discussion during which students, alumni, and faculty called for Harvard to offer more courses and hire more faculty in the field. A handout distributed at the event said Harvard currently has only two tenure-track faculty members whose work relates to Asian and Pacific American studies, as far as event organizers know.
Earlier this semester, the Committee on EMR rolled out a working group devoted to Asian American studies, the College’s first academic organization devoted to the subject. The group provides students and interested faculty with a setting in which to discuss work related to the field, and one of the two students who organized the Friday meeting is involved in the working group.
“Asian and Pacific American studies is huge,” English associate professor Ju Yon Kim said. “To have only two classes a year that cover this means that there are going to be things that end up falling off the syllabus.”
As a result of faculty and curricular shortages, several attendees said, students are unable to pursue studies in the field.
“I believe that having such a program is important for developing thoughts between communities and strengthening political activism,” said Sidney C. Li ’19, one of the event’s moderators.
Saying that “the study of Pacific Islands [at Harvard] is next to nothing,” Shelly D. A. Preza ’17 pointed to the importance of including the studies of Pacific American peoples in discussions surrounding Asian American studies. Currently, the title of EMR’s working group does not include explicit reference to Pacific American studies.
Tynan Jackson ’19, an attendee to the discussion, said he thought Harvard should adopt Asian and Pacific American studies to benefit its own students, but also to serve as an example for other universities in the United States.
“I just don’t understand why Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, would not want to be a pioneer in Asian American studies and be able to celebrate these histories,” he said.
This semester, the College launched a pathway in Latino Studies within the EMR secondary after students and faculty spent years pushing for a formal program.
Now, Li said he is hopeful that the open discussions and events organized by the working group are shifting the group one step closer to its goals of a formal program for Asian and Pacific American studies.
“We have a lot support from community to move forward,” he said. “I am optimistic.”

CORRECTIONS: December 7, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Friday town hall was a meeting of a working group devoted to Asian American studies. In fact, while one of the student organizers is involved in the working group, it was not run by the group. An earlier version also misstated the title of Tessa Lowinske Desmond. In fact, she is the former program coordinator of the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights, not its current one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is the spring of 2014 and two Harvard women’s fencers are squaring off for the NCAA individual championship in saber. Though teammates, this wasn’t the first time the two had met, and it most certainly wouldn’t be the last.
In a closely contested match, then-freshman Adrienne Jarocki narrowly bested teammate, friend, and then-sophomore Aliya Itzkowitz to confirm herself as the best collegiate saber fencer in the country for the year.
Crimson coach Peter Brand’s ability to recruit two genuine stars at the collegiate level has been a step up for the Harvard fencing program. Even more so when you consider them as teammates and sparring partners nearly every practice at the Malkin Athletic Center.
The NCAA final in the spring of 2014 can be seen as a great achievement for both fencers—it highlighted the similarities between the two and how their relationship has propelled each other to greater heights.
Throughout both of their lives, the two athletes have been pushing themselves for gold. in fencing, there’s wins and losses, and no in between. Just the fencer and her saber.
The two have had an interestingly symmetric rise to success. Harvard, to its credit, has brought these two forces together so that everyday in practice two of the best saber fencers in the US can spar against each other. But along the way, the two have become much more than simply partners on the strip.
Itzkowitz grew up in London but had a two-year stint in New York from when she was nine. In Manhattan, a friend’s mother told Itzkowitz’s mother about a fencing club in the area, thus beginning Itzkowitz’s career.
Her coach in New York would also become Jarocki’s later on. When Itzkowitz moved back to London, she joined the prestigious Camden Fencing Club, one of the two most notable saber clubs in England. From there, her career took off.
She has represented Great Britain at major international tournaments, but perhaps her most important event to date was the U-17 Camden International, a tournament which was conveniently hosted by her home club.
Itzkowitz was impressive throughout the tournament and finished second. But more importantly, she got the attention of an important attendee. Brand had been looking for talent, and Itzkowitz’s performance with her saber piqued his interest.
While at these international tournaments, Itzkowitz often ran into Jarocki on the strip and off it. The nature of the fencing world is small, resulting in competitors often knowing about each other and meeting. Thus, the two had known each other and competed against each other on multiple occasion.
Jarocki, like her Harvard teammate, also started her fencing career in New York City. But instead of a referral, Jarocki’s mother learned about a fencing opportunity through the local Polish newspaper when her daughter was 12.
After two years, she joined a club team and competed in national tournaments and joined Itzkowitz in the international circuit.
When it came to college decisions, Jarocki, like Itzkowitz, was in high demand. She elected to fence for the Crimson and become a teammate of who she called a “big foe.”
“When I found out I was coming here, and she was already here already I was really excited,” Jarocki said. “She is really good.”
In practice, the two have pushed each other to achieve more, work harder, and avoid slacking off.
“With me and her, we both work really hard, and it’s been great having someone like that on the team who also really wants to improve and compete,” Itzkowitz said.
When one of them is sitting on the bench or is inactive in general, the other will encourage the other to get up and get fencing. The two help each other take full advantage of the sport that they love so much.
And when squaring off in practice, competitive sparks tend to fly between the two.
“We definitely get intense, [and] not just us, the guys too,” Itzkowitz said. “Saber attracts big personalities. It’s a lot quicker and more dramatic and also more subjective, which can lead to some arguing in practice.”
Not only are the two fencing against each other daily, but in the largest national and international tournaments, they are squaring off with each other on the strip as well.
When they encounter each other as opponents, both put away their friendship and battle on.
For Itzkowitz, it is important for her to see Jarocki only as a competitor in those situations.
“Its definitely tough,” Itzkowitz said. “We had to fence a couple of weeks ago in the final of the Penn State Open. I think I’ve gotten quite good at pretending it’s anyone else. It’s definitely something I used to struggle with [be]cause you’re like “oh it’s my friend,” and you kind of lose the competitive drive to it.”
Jarocki’s focus is similar but perhaps more clear cut in determining friend and foe based on the situation.
“We both dissociate ourselves from our friendship,” Jarocki said. “When we are fencing, we fence, that’s our goal—to win—no matter who you are fencing against.”
Though competing against a teammate outside of practice seems strange, in fencing it’s simply part of the sport.
“It is the nature of fencing,” Itzkowitz said. “In the Olympics and Internationally, fencing is both a team sport and an individual sport, so I’ve had that before with my [Great Britain] teammates, when you are cheering them on in a team tournament [and] then you have to compete against them in an individual tourney.”
This spring, Itzkowitz and Jarocki will hope to bring home the team’s first Ivy League Championship. Led by the two sabers, the women’s fencing team will be trying to make history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, furious rallies come up a little bit short, and that was the case for the Harvard women’s basketball squad on Saturday night.
The Crimson (4-4) found itself trailing Florida Gulf Coast University (5-3) by 25 points early in the third quarter but hustled its way back to a 53-47 deficit later in the period after unleashing a 21-2 run.
Getting over the final hump proved to be too much, however, as the Eagles hit critical free throws in the final minute of the game to pull away from the Crimson en route to a final score of 74-65. The closest Harvard would come to tying the game was a five-point deficit with 1:05 to play.
“Last night really shows how great this team can be, but it all comes down to how we start off the game,” sophomore guard Kirby Porter said. “Getting off to a slow start came back to bite us in the end.  That push in the second half just wasn’t enough.”
Co-captain Kit Metoyer ignited the Crimson offensive surge with an eight-point outburst in the third quarter, but the defense played an enormous role in the second half’s momentum swing.
“We really pride ourselves on being the better defensive team on the court and the better rebounding team on the court,” Porter said. “Once we get those two aspects of our team dynamic going, we’re honestly unstoppable. And I believe it was our defense that got [our rally] going last night.”
Metoyer and fellow captain AnnMarie Healy ultimately led all Harvard scorers with 11 points apiece, while senior guard Shilpa Tummala recorded a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds in the loss. Tummala also dished out a team-high six assists.
The Crimson dug itself into a deep rut with cold shooting from the floor early on, making just 12-of-32 shots in the first half. On the other hand, FGCU took control of the scoreboard by sinking six of its first seven shots, taking a 29-13 lead at the end of the first quarter and stretching its lead to 45-26 by halftime.
Eagles senior guard Kaneisha Atwater, a 2014-15 Atlantic Sun All-Conference first teamer, controlled the pace of the game from the outset, showering down three treys en route to a game-high 27 points on 10-for-22 shooting.
FGCU sophomores Haley Laughter and Taylor Gradinjan scored 17 and 12 points, respectively, combining for eight three-pointers along the way. The entire Harvard offense managed only five—Tummala had an especially rough night from beyond the arc, making only one shot on 10 attempts.
The combination of Laughter’s and Gradinjan’s well-timed three-pointers, in addition to Atwater’s blistering speed, served to slow down the momentum of the Crimson’s third-quarter rush. Atwater ended the Eagle’s scoring drought with a layup late in the third, and she and Laughter followed up with two three-balls to break the spell and regain control of the game.
“Coming back from a big deficit like that against a good team is virtually impossible,” Harvard junior forward Destiny Nunley said. “Great teams will come back like we did, but great teams will also keep that lead—they won’t let us chip away.”
Harvard and FGCU traded baskets until the final minute, after which the Crimson started to foul, but the Eagles made all six of their foul shots to clinch the game. Tummala and freshman guard Madeline Raster missed several desperation deep balls in the waning seconds.
Harvard dominated the boards, grabbing 49 rebounds to the Eagles’s 32, but that stat didn’t matter when the shots didn’t fall. The Crimson finished the game shooting 22 percent from beyond the arc and FGCU shot 38 percent.
Harvard moves to 1-3 on the road and dropped both games in its short Sunshine State road trip, coming up short in Fort Myers two nights after being blown out by No. 24/23 South Florida. The win was the first for FGCU on its home court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to climb to the summit of the ECAC standings, the No. 7/8 Harvard women’s ice hockey team hit the road this weekend, taking on conference foes Princeton and No. 4/4 Quinnipiac.
A pair of extra-frame goals in both games, however, derailed those plans, as the Crimson fell to the Tigers (9-4-1, 5-4-1 Ivy), 2-1, in overtime before losing to the Bobcats (13-1-3, 7-1-2) by the same score in a similar fashion.
QUINNIPIAC 2, HARVARD 1
After conceding an overtime goal the night before, the Crimson (8-4-1, 5-3-1) looked to flip the script on its opponents as it went into the extra frame for the second consecutive game. However, Quinnipiac forward Melissa Samoskevich had a different idea, as the rookie’s goal with just 55 seconds remaining sent Harvard to its second-straight defeat.
“We didn’t use our speed as well as we could have, and we had a lot of turnovers,” co-captain Michelle Picard said. “Those turnovers killed us in the end.”
It was a quiet first stanza for Harvard, as an offense that had been firing on all cylinders going into the weekend was held to five shots, only two of which were on goal. On the other end, the Bobcats sent 10 shots at Crimson co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer, who had 31 total saves on the day.
While the Bruderheim, Alberta, native was able to prevent the first nine shots from finding the twine, attempt number 10 was the breakthrough for Quinnipiac.
After Harvard senior forward Mary Parker lost possession in her own defensive zone, Quinnipiac forward Taylar Cianfarano passed the puck down the ice to forward Emma Woods, whose backhand shot made its way past Maschmeyer at the 18:48 mark.
Though Harvard piled on pressure in the second stanza, the Crimson was unable to break through until the third frame.
Sophomore forward Lexie Laing split two defenders inside the Quinnipiac defensive zone, forwarding the puck along the boards before sending it back at goal, where it bounced off goalie Sydney Rossman to sophomore forward Karly Heffernan. The Harvard sophomore fired a shot into the top left corner for second goal of the season, bringing the Crimson even.
After both teams failed to gain an advantage in what remained of the third frame, Harvard came out firing in overtime, outshooting Quinnipiac six to one in the first four minutes. Samoskevich’s shot, which was just the second of the stanza for the Bobcats, proved to be the dagger.
“When we play really good opponents it really just comes down to a few mistakes here and there and everything really matters,” sophomore defenseman Chelsea Ziadie said. “This weekend was pretty heartbreaking because it came down to a few mistakes in overtime in both games.”
PRINCETON 2, HARVARD 1
The road trip started off in heartbreaking fashion for the Crimson, as junior defender Kelsey Koelzer’s shot from the right faceoff circle with 2:33 remaining in overtime claimed the Tigers’ second consecutive victory over Harvard.
“[Princeton] capitalized on their opportunities, and we didn’t,” Picard said. “They made a couple more plays than we did and that’s it. That’s what it comes down to.”
After both teams failed to breakthrough in the first two periods, Harvard took the lead via junior forward Sydney Daniels. After senior forward Miye D’Oench’s shot outside the crease was blocked by Princeton goalie Kimberly Newell, Daniels rushed in to tap in the loose rebound.
Though the Crimson had taken the lead, it was the Tigers who were in control for the majority of the game. After Harvard claimed an 11-5 shots on goal advantage in the first 20 minutes of play, Princeton came back to life.
By the end of the game, the Tigers had outshot the Crimson, 39-26, and won 33 of the 54 faceoffs in the clash.
A large component of the momentum shift was penalties. Harvard committed five penalties in the game compared to two for Princeton and was unable to establish a rhythm.
“We had a great start in the first period. We were playing fast, we were playing great Harvard hockey,” Ziadie said. “The penalties gave Princeton more momentum and it was hard to come back from that and gain the momentum back.”
Princeton’s continued persistence paid off with just over eight minutes remaining in regular time.
Defenseman Molly Strabley tied things up for the Tigers, as her shot from the point rocketed its way past Maschmeyer, who had a season-high 37 saves and moved into second all-time on the Harvard saves list.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Crimson fell one win short of its ultimate goal—earning a bid in the NCAA Tournament. Fast forward a year, and the Harvard women’s volleyball team found itself on a plane headed to the program’s first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance.
For one set, the Harvard women’s volleyball team went toe-to-toe with a top five team in the country on the college game’s biggest stage.
For one moment, it looked like the dream might live on past Friday night. But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.
After taking down the Big Green last weekend to clinch the automatic Ivy League bid to the NCAA Tournament, the Crimson (15-11, 10-4 Ivy) sent a scare to No. 5 Nebraska (27-4, 17-3 Big Ten), winning the first set before dropping three straight en route to Harvard’s elimination.
“I’d say it was an amazing experience,” senior Kathleen Wallace said. I think I couldn’t have been prouder of how our team played. We had talked about going to the tournament for so long.”
With both teams tied at nine points apiece in the first set, junior setter Corie Bain rattled off two kills that, when coupled with two Cornhuskers attack errors, gave Harvard a four-point cushion.
Later in the set, a pair of kills from Wallace and freshman Jocelyn Meyer led a Crimson charge that brought the squad within one point of stealing a set from the Cornhuskers. After a Nebraska kill cut the Harvard lead to two, co-captain Caroline Holte slammed the door shut on the set with a kill set up by Bain.
“It honestly felt like I wasn’t even playing volleyball,” Holte said. “It felt like an out-of-body experience…. It sort of just happened without even thinking about it.”
But in the end, the Nebraska attack was too potent for the Crimson defense to handle. Four players recorded double-digit kills for the Cornhuskers, including a team-high 15 from Kadie Rolfzen. Kelly Hunter also recorded 54 assists for Nebraska, the most registered against the Crimson this year in front of the 8,000-plus fans in Lincoln.
“It felt like 13 billion people,” Holte said. “It was just so invigorating..[and] our team played so well under it. We’ve obviously never played in front of that many people before.”
After losing the first set, the Cornhuskers rattled off ten straight points to set the tone for the rest of the game. The Crimson would only be able to close the gap to seven for the rest of the set.
“I think their players have very good court awareness, they see shots on the court and are very accurate in executing them,” Wallace said. “I also think compared to other teams we played over the regular season, their stamina [was better]. They know how to play long matches.”
While the Crimson’s first set victory came as a result of clean play—Harvard notched only three errors compared to the Cornhuskers’ eight—the same could not be said about the subsequent three sets of play. The Crimson recorded 22 errors over the rest of the game to Nebraska’s dozen.
The mistakes added up, preventing the Crimson from pulling off the upset and stunning the predominantly Nebraska crowd.
The Crimson failed to get anything going offensively in the last three sets, failing to reach 20 points in any of the three after putting up 25 in the first set victory.
Bain recorded her eighth triple-double of the year in the losing effort, recording a team-high in kills and digs with 13 and 14, respectively, to go along with 19 assists.
Co-captain Hannah Schmidt ended her Crimson career with a team-high 22 assists, and senior libero Sindhu Vegesena put up 11 digs. Wallace finished with 12 kills, while Holte registered five kills and a block.
“It was a magical way to end the seniors’ four years,” Holte said. “I think it’s the best team that Harvard women’s volleyball has ever seen.... It’s a steppingstone for Harvard volleyball’s future.”
