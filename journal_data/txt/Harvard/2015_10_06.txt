The first step to making something is gathering the materials. For me, that means shopping for fabric. Some people might prefer to design before shopping, but I find my inspiration in the colors, patterns, and textures of my material. All of the fabrics used in this collection I bought while doing research in Ghana.

Designing clothes has three main steps: creating a design, figuring out if it is feasible, and cultivating confidence that you can pull it off when it is made. Sewing takes a lot of research whether it is observing the latest trends or studying historical costumes (my specialty). Picking the right design is all about knowing what looks good on you, what the limits of your skills are, and what you will be comfortable wearing later. There is no point in making something that is in style but doesn’t fit who you are. So don’t be afraid to try new things or bring back a relic. Fashion is all about ingenuity and being yourself!

Though making clothes usually elicits images of sewing, the actual process is more focused on cutting. Fabric is the limiting factor of clothing production, and once something is cut it cannot be uncut. Though cutting is the most stressful part of the process, it is also one of the most interesting. Figuring out how to place pattern pieces so that the design lines up perfectly is a challenge and is not always possible, but it is extremely satisfying when it does happen. Once everything is cut out, the pieces are a puzzle that has to be pinned back together.

Barbara Krakow Gallery doesn’t need you. Like Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry, and many of the other commercial establishments on Newbury Street, it is a luxury retailer. But unlike those businesses, Barbara Krakow Gallery neither desires foot traffic nor relies on in-store, local, or even domestic sales.
A contemporary art dealer since 1964, Krakow initially opened a gallery at 7 Newbury Street (the current residence of the Nespresso store) but felt stifled by the high rate of foot traffic. Most commercial galleries, including those I wrote about in my last column, covet foot traffic, hoping to promote the gallery’s name, its artists, and its exhibitions to boost recognition and revenue. Barbara Krakow Gallery, however, represents “blue-chip” artists like Chuck Close, Ellsworth Kelly, and Richard Serra, whose well-known names need no promotion and whose prices (pieces by each of these artists have sold for more than $4 million at auction) place their works beyond the budget of most casual window shoppers. As a result, while some of Krakow’s buyers hail from Massachusetts, much of her clientele are serious art collectors living in New York, California, and outside the U.S. who first interact with the artwork through the gallery’s website. According to the gallery’s associate director, Ryan Cross, Krakow was able to build up a “huge international following” because she was one of the first gallerists to use the Internet. Thus unburdened of the need to lure potential clients off the street, Krakow moved her gallery to its current location in 1983.
Though just across the street from its former conspicuous location, Barbara Krakow Gallery at 10 Newbury St. #5 is only accessed by those who are looking for it—and that’s the point. The space is marked on the street by only one of six small placards next to the door, such that guests hoping to see Krakow’s exhibitions must first wind through a narrow corridor and ride a tight elevator to the fifth floor. As a result of its relative seclusion, the gallery ensures that all of its visitors have come specifically to see the works on display, and it rewards them with personal attention from the self-described gallery “educators.” Generously sacrificing aesthetics, the gallery installed carpeting so that any work in any medium can be brought onto the gallery floor at any time. With this accomodation in place, they offer every visitor the opportunity to see any work in storage on demand, encouraging a comprehensive education on its artists’ practices.
But the real fruits of Barbara Krakow Gallery’s independence from in-store retail come in the form of experimental and innovative curating. Cross describes the curatorial freedom as liberating, saying, “You can really delve into things and explore.” Currently featured in its central space is “Head to Head,” an exhibition centered on “Double Bill (Part 2):…and Sander,” a lithograph of two images silkscreened by John Baldessari, an artist whom Krakow represents. That work fuses two gelatin silver photographs—one by the 20th century German photographer August Sander and one by the celebrated photographic artist Diane Arbus—resulting in a composite image that looks remarkably similar to Arbus’s iconic picture “Identical Twins, Roselle, New Jersey, 1967.” The exhibition pamphlet suggests that Baldessari draws comparisons between the two photographers, questioning their relationship and probing into why Arbus achieved prominence while Sander remains much less acclaimed. Inspired by Baldessari’s work, the Barbara Krakow Gallery decided to design a show that placed his work in physical dialogue with the two older, now deceased artists, hanging Baldessari’s picture next to several of their photographs. Given Baldessari’s established position in the contemporary canon, the gallery doesn’t need to justify his work but is instead able to engage with it on a conceptual level.
Adjacent to “Head to Head” is “Segments,” an eclectic three-work curatorial exploration into the relationship of parts to a whole. This exhibition includes “Complex Forms,” an optical goldmine of three progressively denser etchings by Sol LeWitt, Giulio Paolini’s “Phoenix,” a difficult nine-part work playing on the idea of one-point perspective in which—as the pamphlet aptly points out—“Things don’t quite make sense,” and a seemingly light hearted sculptural work that places four “found objects”—a miniature bear, two bocce balls, and a chew toy—on a beautifully veneered plywood shelf by Haim Steinbach. The extreme diversity of the works heightens the show’s thematic effectiveness as each work examines the concept of segmental relationships both individually and collectively, forming a “whole” exhibition.
Both shows cast Barbara Krakow Gallery as a kunsthalle, the German term for a non-collecting museum that mounts temporary exhibitions. Because selling artwork is not the main consideration in curating their shows, Krakow and her team are regularly able to put on thoughtful exhibitions of rewarding conceptual and minimalist works, showcasing the high caliber of Krakow’s stable without sacrificing intellectual rigor. The gallery also veers towards the kunsthalle in its social functions, choosing to host regular talks instead of the typical commercial gallery exhibition opening parties. As Cross describes it, “We don’t have your traditional bad wine and traditional spread of cheese that most places have.”
Importantly, the gallery marks itself as an established institution by engaging Boston museums in its exhibitions. In 2012, when the Museum of Fine Arts showed a retrospective of the American figurative painter Alex Katz, Barbara Krakow Gallery exhibited “Alex Katz: 35 Years of Portraits,” setting up a intra-city artistic dialogue. It would be naive to view such a curatorial decision as purely selfless, as it likely boosted the gallery’s prestige and strengthened Katz’s market. But regardless of motivation, it was a thoughtful gift to art-minded Bostonians. Unsurprisingly, the gallery was named Best Art Gallery that year by Best of Boston.

The first track on Odetta Hartman’s debut album features, among other noisemakers, a banjo, a violin, Hartman’s smoky singing, various found sound recordings, and, near the end, the unmistakable thump of a drum machine. In less capable hands, this musical amalgam might fail to cohere into an album. But throughout “222,” Hartman, along with her talented producer Jack Inslee, deftly brings together such different and sometimes surprising elements into beautiful, experimental, and integrative arrangements.
“222” is one tenth as long as its name would suggest, clocking in at a mere 22 minutes. Yet, in this small space, Hartman has created an incredible series of songs. The offerings are concisely composed—while none of the eight tracks is longer than a poppy three and a half minutes, they feel substantial and full of fascinating, carefully wrought detail. They are detailed without being cluttered or overwhelmed with ideas. The singularity of form results from Hartman’s unique but remarkably consistent style. Hartman, a 26-year old New York native, draws on what could be termed American folk styles; blues, country, and folk proper, so to speak. Her take on folk tends towards the experimental—“222” seems inspired both by such classics of the sub-genre as Patti Smith’s 1975 album “Horses” in its proto-punk sonic experimentations and Linda Perhacs’s gauzy, sensual, gently psychedelic 1970 album “Parallelograms.”
Hartman has a sense for the mystic and the mythic. Her lyrics frequently employ spiritual imagery—the Devil, in particular, is a recurring figure, appearing in about half the songs on the album. She takes a keen interest in ritual and rite. “Dreamcatchers,” for instance, captures a vision of an occult ceremony. “Lucky Dog” more lightly explores everyday superstitious practice: throwing salt over one’s shoulder, avoiding broken mirrors, and the like. Hartman nimbly switches between darker, more intense songs and lighter, happier fare—she has a flexible and beautifully expressive voice, as well a wide variety of musical tools at her disposal. “Dreamcatchers,” the heaviest song on the album, smoothly transitions into one of the mellowest and most mellifluous tunes, the Laurel Canyon-ish “Lazy LA.” Hartman is also talented at blending tones and themes; in “Tap Tap,” she sings quietly, meditatively, over a hazy, diaphanous guitar arrangement about an encounter with the Devil, eerily crooning lines such as, “tap tap went the cloven feet.” She describes meeting him in the “valley of Angels,” a clever inversion of the famous image from Psalm 23. This is emblematic of the playful inventiveness that marks Hartman’s music, a certain impish, wonderfully vital quality. She also intriguingly plays with the idea of authenticity itself—on the opening track, “Creektime,” she sings with a slightly affected, Joplin-esque bluesy rasp: “Oh truth be told this ain’t no fable.”
Hartman does sun-dappled nearly as well as she does dusky, and one of the highlights of the album is the sweet, dreamy “Limoncello.” On the lightly strummed chorus, Hartman, as if transmitting folkish wisdom—a lovely touch—offers instructions, if incomplete ones, for making the titular lemon liquor. “Limoncello” is a love song, imbued with a certain wistful longing—she sings, “I don’t mind killing time, until I see you again.” Earlier in the song, she effusively describes herself as being the happiest she’s ever been. It’s a beautiful track and a moving listen.
The best track on the album is “Dreamcatchers,” an incredible, riveting listen. The song narrates the story of a recurring nightmare Hartman experienced as a child. She sings, over a clanging, evocative banjo line, of envisioning a man standing in her doorway about to kidnap her. The song sounds rootsy and dark, as if taken from a spooky, ancient folk myth. Various eerie, nightmarish sonic effects further augment and intensify the sound. At the end of the song, the Devil succeeds in taking the child away, leading her to a hellish hoedown. The tempo quickens. There is whooping and stomping and a long, eerie, skittering instrumental screech. Over this flame-licked arrangement, Hartman wordlessly vocalizes, howling and moaning and, to borrow from Coleridge, sounding a bit like a “woman wailing for her demon-lover.” The fever dream ends as quickly as it begins, abruptly breaking off mid-scream. It is an absolutely stunning song in an album full of them. “222” showcases Hartman at her best—spinning her personal experiences into a deeply affecting and very beautiful Americana folk mythos. It is powerfully experimental, inventive, and playful.

One could say that Ernest Hemingway’s self-exile to Paris was somewhat analogous to a gap year—similar to that which inspired the new student-written play “The Son Also Rises.” Patric C. W. Verrone ’18 wrote] the play after his own gap year, when he traveled around Europe and read Hemingway’s novel “The Sun Also Rises.” The young, hopeless characters of the Lost Generation captured Verrone’s attention and led to his 21st-century reimagining of the work.
Originally, Verrone’s script was a one-act; the Blank Theater in Hollywood performed that version of it last summer. After returning to Harvard, Verrone found himself repeatedly revising the story. Now, he and Jamie P. Herring ’18 are co-directing a new production of the piece, which will run Oct. 8-Oct.11 in the Adams Pool Theater. The story, renewed with themes of fluid sexuality and modern existentialism, is the expatriate life—millennial-style. Jake Barnes, the protagonist, spends his time with a group of friends who have also dropped out of Princeton and moved west to California. Though Barnes wants to be a writer, the group’s motivations pull him in weirder directions. The entire crew eventually ends up at a music festival called (winkingly) Pampalana.
Benjamin I. Ubiñas ’19, who plays Jake Barnes, views his character as a young man torn between two motivations. “I see it as a struggle between a desire to rebel and a desire to produce,” Ubiñas says. Like many students, Barnes and his cohort want to assert their sense of youth while also being pragmatic.
The cast hopes their characters’ search for what matters most comes across in the play—even as they get rip-roaring drunk and sleep indiscriminately with one another. That search might feel familiar to many Harvard students; Verrone feels that many of the play’s moments are directly drawn from life on campus. “A lot of them are very exaggerated people, but people you could run into on Mass. Ave on Friday night,” he says.
Verrone says he wants to spark conversation. “This is my exaggerated, hyper-realistic version of what I think people our age are like. And I just wanted to put it in front of everyone and be like, do you agree? Is this just bullshit? Or is this real?” he says. In the ongoing back-and-forth over millennial identity, head-shaking and naysaying are common and consensus is rare; “The Son Also Rises” aims to add its voice to that debate.

This fall, the Boston Lyric Opera reinterprets one of Giacomo Puccini’s most hallowed pieces: “La Bohème.” Running Oct. 2-11 in the Citi Performing Arts Center, the opera is part of a seasonal lineup that includes reimagined classics and unconventional pieces, such as Philip Glass’s “In the Penal Colony” and Jules Massenet’s “Werther.” Set against the backdrop of the 1968 Paris student riots, this “La Bohème” seeks to explore the timeless themes of Puccini’s opera while illuminating the universality of human desires.
While the opera’s plotline remains mostly unchanged, director Rosetta Cucchi has found innovative ways to transport “La Bohème” more than 130 years forward into the turbulent atmosphere of 1968 Paris. After every act, a contemporary film clip plays on a projector screen; according to the show program, this choice was inspired by German filmmaker Bertolt Brecht, who used signs and text in many of his movies. In this milieu of political unrest and young idealism, Mimi (Kelly Kaduce) and Rodolfo (Jesus Garcia), young neighbors, explore their fragile yet passionate relationship. Like the original opera, this production explores the chasm between unforgiving reality and an idealized future; Rodolfo and Mimi’s frequent references to a spring that never comes embody the disappointed hopes of the postwar generation.
The stars of the show, Kaduce and Garcia, display a lighthearted chemistry that is powerful enough to convey the emotional impact of the more dramatic moments of the opera. Kaduce’s performance of “Sono andati” in the fourth and final act is truly heart-rending; as Mimi becomes more and more ill with tuberculosis, Kaduce artfully contrasts her fear of mortality with the tenderness she feels for Rodolfo. Garcia also performs admirably in his duets with Kaduce, yet he seems more at home playing the anguished young man than the passionate lover. His duets with his best friend Marcello (Jonathan Byer) are arguably his strongest moments; “O Mimì, tu più non torni,” in which Rodolfo and Marcello express their frustration in love, is particularly captivating. However, despite Kaduce and Garcia’s easy rapport, their voices struggle to keep up onstage. On opening night, they performed solidly from the second act onward, but their voices were initially weak—“Che gelida manina” and “Si, mi chiamano Mimi” lost much of their impact as a result. Garcia’s voice is strained when he ascends into his upper register or projects more—at the most emotionally vital moments of the first act—while Kaduce’s vibrato is inconsistent and distracting. While Kaduce and Garcia do not add anything innovative to the production, they also do not detract from it; they allow the supporting cast, the true strength of the production, to shine.
The unexpected moments of brotherly banter between Rodolfo and his roommates—Marcello, Colline (Brandon Cedel), and Schaunard (Andrew Garland)—are a particular highlight; their jocular and occasionally cynical remarks provide a contrast to the seriousness of Mimi and Rodolfo’s love. Byer especially excels at imbuing his role with charm and presence without taking attention away from the central love story. In Act II, when Marcello’s ex-lover Musetta (Emily Birsan) walks in with another man and sings the sultry “Quando m’en vo” to win back his affections, Marcello is every bit the comically enraged suitor. Birsan is also a pillar of this “La Bohème”; strong from the start, she conveys Musetta’s firm will and soft heart. She switches skillfully from angry banter with Marcello to tender words to comfort the dying Mimi, and she does it all with inexhaustible vivacity. She also uses an especially delightful technique of ending her high notes in little shrieks while quarreling with Marcello, to great humorous effect.
Unfortunately, the show’s staging is also in some aspects unclear. Rodolfo’s flat is filled with a jumble of eerily lighted furniture that blocks natural movement on the stage, to the extent that the two lovers are sometimes almost lost among the miscellany. In the background of several scenes is a large moon with the words “time is an invention” written upon it. A clear attempt at universalizing the themes of Puccini’s opera, the heavy-handedness of this commentary unfortunately continues throughout the rest of the production. In subsequent scenes, the background is replaced by various, equally incongruous collages: one, for example, is a disjointed mass of French cultural references with the title of Jean-Luc Godard’s film “Masculin Féminin” at its center. While the movie is relevant to the dueling forces of political idealism and capitalist comfort that came to the forefront in the student revolt of 1968, the entire collage is painfully unsubtle; it seems that the directors do not trust the audience to interpret the nuances of revolutionary ideology. Altogether, instead of meaningfully recontextualizing Puccini’s opera, the staging becomes a veneer of poorly executed cultural pastiche.
Despite the show’s issues, it successfully illustrates that the longing for love is universal, even if the surrounding cultural and political milieu is not. It clearly portrays themes of youthful idealism, inner turmoil, and human discontent—although at times too clearly. While the production is by no means perfect, its changed setting is thought-provoking and well-chosen, and underlines Puccini’s innate understanding of the constancies of the human heart.

When a person or an orchestra performs classical works, they are expected not only to use expert technique but also to express the theme of the piece and evoke an emotional response. Last Saturday, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and guest pianist Evgeny Kissin succeeded in this regard with their interpretation of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 9, Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff’s “Symphonic Dances,” honoring the memories of some of Russia’s greatest composers.
The concert began on a strong note with a dramatic rendition of the first movement of the 9th Symphony. The clear sounds of the flute coalesced to resemble the morning trill of a bird, and the string and brass sections came together in nearly anthemic harmony to reflect the patriotic sentiment behind the piece. Likewise, the transition between the first and second movements led the Allegro smoothly into the Moderato, with the orchestra keeping focus on the darker mood of the piece by blending to legato from a pronounced staccato.
In comparison to the skillful execution of the Shostakovich, the BSO’s interpretation of “Symphonic Dances” felt lacking. The orchestra sacrificed precision for sentimentality, and so the crescendos seemed no longer as dramatic, the sound no longer as lively; the piece threatened to lull audience members to sleep instead of awakening them to the new music being played. As the piece came to an end, however, the orchestra was ultimately able to bring the music to life again with its sudden incorporation of heavy brass and triangles.
But it was Kissin’s highly musical interpretation of Tchaikovsky that stole the show, as he bridged the gaps between forte and piano, dramatic chords and soft notes, while tailoring his playing perfectly to that of the orchestra. Kissin’s rendition of the introduction was uncommonly expressive—evoking ideas of love, pain, and excitement through the force and confidence with which the pianist executed the opening chords. The melodic contributions of the orchestra further complemented Kissin’s virtuosity, taking the piece through countless emotional highs and lows. It was no surprise that the audience clamored for more, prompting Kissin to return for an encore in the middle of the concert.
By the evening’s close, it was evident that this concert had achieved its goal in exploring the themes and lives that inspired these definitive pieces. With its wonderfully executed and emotionally satisfying Saturday show, the Boston Symphony Orchestra opened its 2015-2016 season on a high note.

Spellbound Contemporary Ballet is an internationally recognized modern dance company from Rome, founded in 1994 by choreographer and artistic director Mauro Astolfi. In anticipation of the troupe’s upcoming Celebrity Series of Boston-sponsored production of “Le Quattro Stagioni (The Four Seasons),” manager Valentina Marini sat down with the Crimson to talk about dance as a channel of expression, Spellbound’s goals, and the different artistic elements that make up “The Four Seasons.”
The Harvard Crimson: How do you feel art differs between Europe and the United States?
Valentina Marini: I think the performing arts in general—it’s something that’s really appreciated [in the U.S.]. There’s a highlight around the performing arts in the country…and what is amazing in it is that it is a part of life [from] high school, [from] university…. I think it’s something that is a part of daily life [for] many people in your country…and this can create a curiosity. It can create an attitude.
THC: What challenges have you faced during the U.S. premiere of “The Four Seasons”?
VM: Every production is a challenge because you cannot imagine if it succeeded or not…. If there is no challenge there is no art because it means things are fixed, no? You must...try to do something that is not done before or maybe mix in ingredients and elements differently…. But the basic challenge is the reaction of the people. It’s always interesting to present something different. We've been in Boston years ago with a...completely different show. So it’s curious now to see how people can react to something so far from what we’ve presented three years ago…. And then the chapter after is the challenge [of] how to renew the idea of the seasons—so not to put on stage the seasons in the traditional way—and to make it a contemporary performance.
THC: What do you hope the audience will experience or take away from this show?
VM: I just simply wish that they can enjoy [it]. What they decide to take away as inspiration, it’s something very personal, so we don’t want to push people to have a specific idea about the show. In this way, you have different point[s] of view. Maybe a kid can enjoy just the videos [that are part of the set]. Maybe someone with a different point of view can follow the line of the season and read between the lines something that is more connected to the feeling of the chapters of the life of a human being. Someone is more attract[ed] by the challenging use of the props…. Mauro [is] trying to give suggestion, but not keep the audience on a certain line [to] leave the freedom of interpretation.
THC: Why did you juxtapose classical music with modern dance in this production?
VM: Music is music. If music is classical, it does not mean the movement cannot be contemporary…. What is important is that in the end is that there is a good connection in between the parts. Mauro loves to create mix[es] in music [and] ballet: classical music with contemporary music, and using contemporary movement with the classical music…. It’s a personal interpretation and a personal vision.
THC: Broadly speaking, what are Spellbound’s goals?

When you’re on your deathbed, when you’ve finally eked out all the distraction you can from cigarettes and sex and amphetamines, when you’re hooked up to a machine that tells you every day how much deader you are than the day before, how do you deal with the fact that nothing you have ever done has had any lasting value, and the only meaningful thing you have ever accomplished is causing all those around you pain and disappointment?
Good question.
What do you do when your career, from your wet-crotched stage debut in your father’s vaudeville hall to your final, disastrous read-through with your producers, has amounted to nothing besides a long series of highly anticipated failures, punctuated by just enough ephemeral success to remind yourself and those around you of your immense but wasted potential?
Good question.
When the show is over and the only people left in the audience are yourself and Death, what do you do?
Good question.
Bob Fosse’s semi-autobiographical “All That Jazz” gives a pretty simple answer—you deal with it.
Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is a successful choreographer whose struggles to finish editing a Hollywood feature while also directing his new Broadway musical, all while still dealing with the personal demands of his ex-wife, daughter, and girlfriend. Dexedrine and cigarettes keep him going until he suffers a heart attack in his doctor’s office, at which point he is carted off for several weeks of “bed rest”—during which he drinks harder and womanizes more than even his usual habits demand. He has increasingly vivid hallucinations of wooing the Angel of Death (Jessica Lange).
As his health continues to fail, one by one his friends and associates abandon his cause. His ex-wife gives up on him; realizing that his insurance will make his unfinished movie profitable, his producers start rooting for his death; his girlfriend abandons him. By the time the second heart-attack hits, he is alone.
As his heart fails, Gideon imagines his death as a magnificent television-benefit dance concert. His former professional associate O’Connor Flood (Ben Vereen) introduces him: "What can I tell you about my next guest? This cat allowed himself to be adored, but not loved, and his success in show business was matched by failure in his personal relationship bag—now, that's where he really bombed. And he came to believe that work, showbusiness, love, his whole life, and even himself and all that jazz was bullshit. He became the numero uno game player—to the point where he didn't know where the games ended and the reality began. Like, to this cat, the only reality was death, man. Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me lay on you a so-so entertainer, not much of a humanitarian, and this cat was never nobody's friend, in his final appearance on the great stage of life (you can applaud if you wanna)—"
Joe Gideon is a choreographer. He creates order out of bodies. For his final feat, he creates order out of his own body’s collapse into physical chaos, which creates emotional order out of the competing strands of his life and brings it all to a close. Death, the great irrationality, is reconciled to the dance of human life. Dancers representing his vascular system writhe in violent but perfect harmony. In a perverse parody of the old Everly Brothers song, he sings happily, “Bye bye life; bye bye happiness; hello loneliness—I think I’m gonna die.” It’s all a show, so we may as well make it a big one.
And seeing that movie is how I accepted death as a reality.

“There’s a feverish quality to a lot of his films,” says Haden Guest, director of the Harvard Film Archive, of Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin. “There’s a sense in which the story itself is less important the the kind of emotions it generates.” He is discussing the works that are screening at the HFA every Friday and Saturday until Nov. 14. These screenings, combined with Maddin’s attendance at two of the shows, presents an opportunity for students and Cambridge residents to interact with both the films and the filmmaker himself.
According to Jeremy M. Rossen, assistant curator of the HFA, the cinematheque hoped to create this archive for some time, and the anticipated arrival of Maddin (who is here as a guest professor in the Visual and Environmental Studies department) served as a motivator for the HFA to create the film screenings. “With some people it’s easier and with some people it’s a little more work, but this programme came together organically and quickly,” Rossen says.
Maddin’s enthusiasm helped the program come together more quickly. “I'm totally honoured to be programmed at the HFA. I've been receiving hard copies of their calendars in my snail mail way up in my arctic home for many years now,” he says referencing his roots in Canada.
The HFA is showcasing works of Maddin’s that range from three to 128 minutes long, from the years 1985-2015, spanning from his very first work (the short “The Dead Father”) to his most recent (“The Forbidden Room”). Guest selected the full-length features in collaboration with Rossen, who curated Maddin’s lesser-known shorts and paired them with the longer films based on aesthetics and length. “[The HFA] was trying to present a programme of work that was balanced with newer and older work [along] with the features and the shorts as well,” Rossen says.
At the last two screenings on Nov. 13 and 14—“My Winnipeg” and “The Forbidden Room”—Maddin will hold question-and-answer sessions. Although he will be present only at two screenings, both the HFA and Maddin encourage anyone interested to attend all of the shows. “I believe—I know for a fact—that watching the kind of films the HFA programs is good for all filmmakers,” Maddin says. “I plan on living there once my busy schedule permits. If Haden Guest permits me to bring my little tent downstairs, I'll be first in line every night.”
The films in this collection seek to provide a glimpse into the mind of Maddin and his signature filmmaking. “There are clearly thematic and formal preoccupations that can be seen across practically all his films; the look, the texture, the feeling, the pulse of Guy Maddin’s films is very distinct,” Haden says.
The HFA’s collaboration with Maddin will not end with these screenings. In December, his newest film, “The Forbidden Room,” will have a theatrical run with multiple showings within a two week block. Also, from January to March, Maddin will be selecting a series of about eight to ten films to screen at the HFA.
These events reflect both the HFA’s and Maddin’s interest not only in showcasing films that have already been made, but also in inspiring budding filmmakers to shoot their own footage. “It's always been my strongest desire that people find themselves in my movies somehow, identify with its situations, or...maybe make their own films as a result,” Maddin says.

Pulitzer Prize winner Geraldine Brooks’s “The Secret Chord” bills itself as a bloodstained reimagining of the life of King David. But it initially raises concerns with its awkward beginning. Brooks appears determined to disprove an assumption that good history and a good novel cannot meet in a single book. And so, in the midst of otherwise beautifully crafted prose, in which historical facts and details are melded seamlessly into a vivid, compelling narrative, Brooks inserts transliterations from Hebrew. From her preliminary declaration that she uses Tanakh transliterations like “Shaul, Shmuel and Shlomo, for example, rather than the perhaps more familiar Saul, Samuel, and Solomon” onward, an unstylish anxiety prevails. This implied request to treat the book with the seriousness owed to a work backed by research distracts in the beginning from its literary qualities. “The Secret Chord” picks up steam, however, to become an excellent novel that elegantly handles its historical context.
Transliterations aside, Brooks’s presentation of historical material is spectacularly accessible. Consider this sentence: “I liked to walk in the garden at that still hour, listening to the low buzz of the bees, enjoying the sharp scent of the dry, fallen cedar needles and the wild zatar that fingered its way between the cracks of the paving stones.” Even without knowing that “zatar” refers to a Middle Eastern herb commonly used in Biblical times but now generally simulated in cooking with cheaper spice blends, the vividity of the image is undiminished. On every page, Brooks’s writing around the potentially difficult historical details is so strong that her essential narrative and imagery are not swallowed up by their context.
Brooks also solves another problem of genre: how to make the leap from religious text to novel. References to the Judeo-Christian God are intertwined with every source for the life of David. He thus presents quite a challenge to the novel writer. A novel should ideally allow for the role of choice in its protagonists’ lives, and a major character who is both omnipotent and omniscient calls the importance of such choices into question. For novelists, God has a tendency to steal the show, and the most obvious solution is to excise God entirely from the story. A “reimagining” of the Israelites as nonreligious or of their prophets as fraudulent is lazy, but would certainly resolve the issue. Brooks has the good taste not to attempt such violence towards her source material. She postpones, however, any mention of God until a reference to “the ark of the Name” a few dozen pages into the book. Enough has happened without Him to show that “The Secret Chord” will be primarily a story of human choices; the mandates of God appear only through prophets and at a distance. While the book hardly departs from orthodoxy from that point on, nonetheless by now the independence of the narrative from God has already been established.
Despite her emphasis on human choices, however, Brooks does not dive directly into the psyche of King David. Instead she filters his story through the perspective of his court prophet, Nathan. Nathan, more commonly referred to as Natan, narrates his relationship with David from his outlaw days to his rule over all Israel—another intervening court prophet, Gad, is presumably ignored for purposes of clarity—and fills in the holes in his own memory with the testimony of other characters. While this account is mostly resentful, leading to what appears on first glance to be an unfriendly portrayal of the king, in considering Brooks’s novelistic task it is also an engaging narrative device. In depictions of David’s other relationships, Brooks continues to approach her novel’s main questions from a similarly innovative individualistic angle but stays faithful enough to the original story. Few scholars believe Brooks’s assertion that David and his friend Jonathan—“Yonatan”—were homosexual lovers, for example, but some do. In presenting this as well as many such relationships, the aspect of history that her narrative is obliged to foreground, Brooks deserves credit for not writing pure fiction. Her interpretations of some of those relationships may not be exactly mainstream, but she keeps well within historical possibility.
Brooks makes it clear that David’s wives are in many ways to be pitied, dwells on the famous betrayal of Uriah, and shows the long trail of bodies of varying innocence that David leaves behind him. But a reading of “The Secret Chord” as unsympathetic to David would be inadequate. Violence, Brooks makes it clear, was endemic to the age in which King David emerged. While hardly an attempt at psychology-based justification for David’s crimes, the book does provide a clear causal link between a violent world and violent men, and this link lends emotional weight to David’s quest to unite and safeguard Israel. David’s legacy of a peaceful kingdom for Solomon to administer is shown to be the triumph of a fundamentally good man. What Brooks has managed is to make the well known story of this royal succession into a moment of great import, a feat that is the epitome of artistry in historical writing. She has written a skillfully nuanced portrayal of David, who emerges with both the magnificence and the understandable flaws of a great man.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of Sep. 30, an exhibition honoring the centenary of Walter Crane’s death opened at Houghton Library. Glass cases displaying vibrant illustrations and lively sketches line either side of the Edison and Newman room to draw viewers into the “World of Walter Crane.”Houghton Library’s Walter Crane collection, though not very well known, is one of the two most important in the world, and the current exhibition seeks to showcase the work of this innovative and influential artist, who was famous during his lifetime but has now been largely forgotten.
Originally trained as an engraver, Crane created works consisting of black outlines filled in with bright colors and often depicts fantastical or fable-like scenes. “He came to prominence in the 1860s and ’70s as a designer of very colorful books for children called toy books that retell nursery rhymes,” says Hope Mayo, curator of printing and graphic arts in the Houghton Library. “He drew very dramatic, multicolored illustrations…. Those were printed in tens of thousands of copies in the second part of the 19th century.”
Justin G. Schiller, a book collector specializing in rare and vintage children’s literature, adds to Mayo’s sentiment about Crane’s work as an illustrator in introducing a genre of writing. “Up until the 1850s, the concept was only just developing to have books for children,” he says. “It was Walter Crane… who developed the idea of creating colored picture books for children [to elevate] their appreciation of art, and also having an attractive and well-written and composed text.” According to him, later children’s book illustrators, including Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and Maurice Sendak, all drew inspiration from Crane’s work.
Walter Crane’s work was also influential in the Art-Nouveau movement of the later 19th and early 20th century, defined by intricate linear designs, often depicting floral or other natural themes. “If one thinks of the Art-Nouveau movement, all the roots…are to be found in Walter Crane’s art,” says Francesca Tancini, an art historian and a fellow of the Houghton Library. “Walter Crane’s books travelled much [more easily], and much wider than William Morris or Edward Burne-Jones’s works, which were more expensive and bigger. It was much more difficult for their items to travel abroad, while Crane usually produced work to be reproduced.”
According to Schiller, though the drawings look simple and straightforward at first, they contain many hidden details that can be found upon closer inspection. “[Crane’s work] takes aspects that eventually developed into the Art Nouveau movement but made it much more refreshing,” he says. “It’s reinterpreting the overall floral symbolisms that you get with Art Nouveau. Walter Crane has personified them into little men dancing like they are in the court of the queen, and he turned flowers into people. He was really the first person to do that on a level for young children.”
Walter Crane was involved with the socialist movement in England as well, and some of his illustrations for the cause are also on display at Houghton. “He was a friend of George Bernard Shaw, who was of the Fabian Society…the main socialist group in England at the time,” Schiller recounts, “Every good revolution needs an illustrator, so Crane often lent his efforts and support.”
Mayo believes that Crane’s work also offers viewers insight on the historical period in which he lived. “I find the way in which his utopian socialist beliefs were interwoven in his life and his work very interesting as examples of ways people were thinking in England at the time,” Mayo says. “I like the incredible range of it.”
In general, Crane’s drawings appeared in a multitude of contexts. “He illustrated many membership cards, banners, badges, coins or medals, and cartoons that were usually sold together with journals and magazines,” Tancini says. “[They] were usually detached from the journals and hung on the walls, so even poor people, the proletariat, had Walter Crane’s illustrations on their walls.”
By showcasing his various works, Houghton Library’s “World of Walter Crane” attempts to pay homage to the influential artist. Whether through displaying his contributions to children’s literature or his illustrations of a more political nature, the exhibit works to highlight his innovations as well as his spirit. “I believe he never lost his childish side, so he was able to understand children and their way of looking at things even before he had children of his own,” Tancini says. “We could say he invented the modern picture book.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The “old Harvard feel” is difficult to define. Perhaps it’s the unmistakable wrought-iron gate at the entrance of Adams House or the majestic bell towers portrayed in films as the quintessential Harvard architectural feature. Maybe it’s the distinct brick archways or the dorm rooms characterized by window seats, brick walls, and now-defunct fireplaces. Perhaps it is not conceptualized in the architecture and physical campus atmosphere at all, but often these aspects are the only tangibility that can be given to such an abstract phrase.
Harvard’s architectural tradition dates back as far as 1718, when Massachusetts Hall, now a freshman dorm, was constructed. However, the oldest upperclassman House dates back a mere century, with current Adams House student residences opening as dormitories in 1902. As Houses undergo or prepare to undergo renewal and renovation, a dilemma emerges: How much of the traditional history and architecture should be preserved at the expense of making room for new and necessary modifications to improve House life?
Quincy House Co-Master Deborah J. Gehrke has been saving extra keys to students’ rooms ever since she became a House master years ago. When Quincy’s Stone Hall was undergoing renovations in 2013, the architects mentioned the idea of instituting something architecturally unique to Quincy House and Gehrke decided the keys would come in handy. Today, keys from each former room are built into the designs above relic mantelpieces that are now located in the hallways of Stone Hall. For Gehrke and Stone Hall residents, the keys are a way of building alumni tradition. “These are the alumni fingerprints here,” Gehrke says. “You can come back if you lived in Stone Hall and say, ‘That was my key.’”
As Houses undergo renewal—first Stone Hall in Quincy, then McKinlock in Leverett, and most recently the entirety of Dunster House—maintaining tradition while enhancing and modernizing living spaces has been integral to the House renovation process. In anticipation of her House’s renewal, Winthrop Co-Master Stephanie Robinson has expressed a desire for new students to be able to experience the same Harvard feel that residents enjoyed years before. “There is something unmistakable about Harvard,” Robinson says. “When you talk to an alum of the College, you can see them going back in their mind's eye as they recall how they experienced Harvard.” Robinson recognizes the important connection of what Harvard Houses means to alumni, and how critical it is to keep that feeling in years to come. She hopes, for example, that residents will be able to walk into the Winthrop Junior Common Room or the Winthrop Library and sense they are at Harvard.
This is not a small concern shared by Robinson alone. Other House masters have been cognizant of the ramifications of the renewal process as feedback from the Quincy, Leverett, and Dunster projects has been collected. “We are all very sensitive and very mindful of updating it and making sure that we are keeping what was done—that we are looking to make sure that we are tech savvy and that we create spaces that generations to come sit and talk and connect, doing all that in the spirit of what Harvard is,” Gehrke says.
In the case of Adams House, which is expected to undergo renewal sometime in the next several years, House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 expresses a mix of concern and optimism about maintaining the architectural values of Adams. “I think that there really is a true architectural and social distinction of Adams House, more than any other House, because of its woodwork, its Gold Room, the FDR Suite, the Coolidge Room, the Pool Theater,” Palfrey says. “These are important things to the history and tradition and archaeological and architectural spirit and interest of Harvard and Adams.” But while Palfrey plans to maintain the spirit of Adams House with renovations, he also has a few new ideas up his sleeve: For example, he wants to create a second floor to the dining hall in order to eliminate interhouse dining restrictions at Adams, as well as a tunnel system to connect Adams’s buildings.
Even with all of these potential additions, stakeholders believe that renewals will strike a delicate balance between preservation and innovation. “I think they’re really going to try to keep that rich Harvard feel,” Winthrop House committee co-chair Marlee A. Ehrlich ’16 says. “They’re really going to try to keep that traditional Georgian architecture.” Winthrop East, for example, will be built with more modern limestone. While it may appear contemporary, the material will connect nicely with the limestone façade on Winthrop’s Gore Hall, according to Ehrlich, in order to balance the traditional Harvard feel with an up-to-date physical appearance.
“The approach to renewal of the River Houses is based first and foremost on the goal of preserving and renewing these historic structures for future generations,” Stephen Kieran of KieranTimberlake, the architectural firm that renovated Quincy’s Stone Hall, writes in an email. “In addition to Harvard’s own standards for its historic structures, the Cambridge Historical Society has review authority as the River Houses are in a historic district,” emphasizing that in general the highest priorities go to exterior architectural elements and major interior rooms—such as the dining hall and library.
Pieces of the past do still remain, even when major modifications have been made. In Quincy, according to Gehrke, granite on the walls were cut and modernized from the building’s old showers, while 75 percent of the hardwood floors in Stone Hall are taken from the original building’s wood. “Bricks and mortar and physicalities don’t encompass 100 percent of the experience, but it’s a huge part of the experience of people who came before and will continue to be a part of the incredible legacy of Harvard,” Robinson says. “There is an importance in having that grand tradition.”
With three Houses already renovated, future Houses that will undergo renovations in the future can benefit from the past and build off potential challenges and successes. “Students here at Winthrop know how students in Leverett and Dunster are reacting to their new spaces, and the message is overall pretty positive,” says Kip C. Richardson, a Winthrop tutor. “It’s different, and yet everybody sort of knows there is something nicer about the renewed spaces, and I anticipate that will be the same here.”
Richardson himself was able to realize that there was in fact something nicer about the renovated spaces. Over the summer, one of the windows in his tutor suite was updated and replaced as the building was prepared for renovation. He noticed that the new window looked exactly the same as the old window, except it sealed better, opened and closed more smoothly, and kept out temperatures better than the old one did.
Enhanced social spaces were a success in Quincy, according to Gehrke, and are thus an important aspect of renovation that residents of Winthrop are considering and looking forward to, according to Ehrlich. The basements in Stone Hall previously housed student summer storage, but the renovation transformed them into common spaces. (This change made Quincy the first House not to offer free, on-campus storage to students, a decision that was met with concern over the financial burdens of seeking third-party storage). According to Ehrlich, Winthrop’s administration is contemplating the addition of a grille and has discussed how to create inclusive social spaces that also offer maximum functionality.
Additionally, according to Kieran, renovated buildings will be fully handicap accessible. Though some are concerned that this will eliminate the traditional vertical entryway structure characteristic to Harvard—since it would be impractical to install an elevator in every single vertical entryway—this isn’t necessarily the case. Stone Hall’s renovations succeeded in installing elevators while maintaining vertical entryways by connecting the entryways horizontally.
According to Gehrke, the Quincy renewal has brought other small changes to enhance student life as well, such as an increased number of electrical outlets, enhanced environmental efficiency (such as rainwater usage for flushing toilets), built-in cubbies in bathrooms, and newer furniture, among others. “I’m so upset that I’ll never live in Winthrop when it’s renovated,” Ehrlich says.
Despite some recent criticism from undergraduates regarding hallway bathrooms and common rooms, Gehrke says that reactions from Quincy alums have been overall positive. “They said they graduated too soon,” she says.
Administrators and House masters have been keen on giving students a voice in the renewal process. For Winthrop, the next House to undergo renewal, this meant forming a student committee that met with the House masters and architects to voice thoughts and opinions about the upcoming renovation process. “These are monumental projects,” Robinson says. “If students are the ones living in these places, they have the best sense of what works and what doesn’t work.”
The meetings occurred last semester, with plans to continue the conversation this semester. “[The architects] changed some of their blueprints based on feedback from some of the students,” Ehrlich says. “That was a huge relief because I know some people were hesitant. But they listened and were so excited and willing to take into consideration students’ opinions.” More than 25 students were on the committee and partook in the town hall-style meetings.
In addition to students and the House masters, two tutors participated in the meetings and helped facilitate discussion. “Those meetings are trying to get everyone on the same page and negotiate out what is going to happen at the end of the day when construction begins,” says Richardson, who was involved in the student committee as a tutor. “Architects learned a lot of things about students and houses and how houses can best serve them.” Leverett House had a similar format to engage students. According to House Co-Master Howard M. Georgi ’68, architects had a series of focus groups with students. Additionally, Georgi invited and hosted the architects at several House events so that they could get a better feel for Leverett life.
The “old Harvard feel,” though intangible, is often associated with the grandiose feeling of being on Harvard’s campus—the physicalities of its historical architecture. But with renovations underway, the idea of this traditional “Harvard feel” is also being reconstructed and renewed. “If you had to stereotype a Harvard feel, it might be the molding, fireplaces, wood paneling. Is that Harvard? Or is it social spaces where kids hang out…is that Harvard?” Gehrke asks. “I’m not sure I know what the typical stereotype is anymore with the House renewal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the forthright gentleman who invaded my morning to tell me that you hoped I was having a great day, Little Girl: Thank you. I was.
To the candid man who approached me, rubbing your crotch and murmuring that you could make love to me all day and night, Baby: I could probably call the cops on you at any hour, Buddy.
To the two sirs who, from the safety of your car, hurled cries of Chica, Beautiful Lady, Sexy, Mami, Honey, and Pretty One out of your windows: You made me want to cry.
As you pounded the center of your steering wheel with the palm of your hand, commanding the attention of additional passers-by with each honk of your horn, you encouraged others to join in your objectification game. Powerless, I waited for your traffic light to change, so you would speed away towards the next corner and the next girl.
There are women who welcome catcalls, who believe that the complimentary—as in, free and unsolicited—comments they receive in the street are compliments. These women should learn how to differentiate a compliment from a slur.
The way I see it, a compliment is composed of three things: its content, the context in which it’s shared, and the speaker’s intent. Of these, the first plays the smallest role.
I often receive—and sometimes give—compliments that aren’t strictly genuine. Have you ever told someone you loved her outfit when you kind of didn’t? You’re excused. We all do this, because compliments are a powerful tool. Used correctly, they brighten moods and boost confidence, even when we aren’t scrupulous in constructing them truthfully.
It should go without saying that a true compliment makes its recipient feel valued and respected—that is, safer than she felt before. But in the wrong context and with the wrong intent, a compliment’s power to effect positivity shatters. These are the variables that make catcalls slurs.
Catcalls are arresting because they decontextualize the language of physical attraction that might be meaningful when exchanged between lovers. I’m flattered to know that someone who cares deeply about me also finds me beautiful, but this is only because I know that they appreciate my personhood more than my biological ability to have sex.
Using the same language, a catcall is vapid. It reduces my worth to that of my appearance. In the public context of the street, coming from the mouth of a stranger, a catcall exploits the verbiage of intimacy and makes me feel both objectified and powerless to rebuke my objectification.
Moreover, there is implicit sexual intent in a catcall by nature of the fact that it is spoken aloud. Since anyone can enjoyably objectify me without my knowing, I must take a man’s brazen expression of arousal to mean that he’s hoping for some favor in return. Hoping that he’s singled out a woman whose self-esteem is low. Hoping that I’ll forget I’m en route to Spanish and will instead fulfill his sexual fantasies in an alley. Hoping that, to quote the gallant young man who followed me around Harvard Square yesterday, I will “suck his dick.”
PSA: Giving a compliment should be an act of altruism. You should not expect or accept anything in return.
Perpetrators of this kind of objectification may not realize how many women they undermine when they insult one. Their comments dismantle the significant, but clearly still inadequate, social progress that feminists have made for all women.
Each time a woman is catcalled, publicly humiliated, and forced to ignore it, the psychology of female objectification becomes evermore seared into the brains of all actors and bystanders involved. We’re already conditioned to look at a woman and see the raw sum of her physical components before we consider her brain. The more we reinforce this subconscious thought process, the more ingrained it becomes in our psychology.
To all of the men who make it a habit to catcall me and other women, here’s something to think about: I do not dress myself to be mentally undressed by you. And if I can’t be sure that you’ll make me feel safe if you kiss me, then I’m not interested in your tongue down my throat, or your hands on my cheeks, or your commentary on my life.
It does not take courage or humility to catcall a woman. It takes a lethal mix of disillusionment and disrespect.

Boehner wept. Often heavily and without regard. There was no stage too big, no occasion too slight for the soon-departing House speaker, who blotted tears beside a bust of Winston Churchill in a small ceremony and quite nearly disintegrated into sobs on “60 Minutes.”
Fitting, then, that Boehner’s turbulent speakership was bookended in tears. The Ohio Republican fought back tears when Nancy Pelosi handed him the gavel in 2011, which he then accepted “cheerfully and gratefully,” only to voluntarily surrender it four short years later. Pope Francis’s address to a joint session of Congress, an equally rainy affair for the devoutly Catholic speaker, was the best coda Boehner could think of to a reign of endless tumult and insatiable insurgency that he never seemed to get a handle of. 
But I come to praise Boehner, not to bury him.
So I won’t talk about the record-shatteringly unproductive 112th and 113th Congresses, which did more nothing than the Do Nothing Congress that Truman battled. Or the 100 or so doomed-from-the-outset attempts to defund Obamacare. Or Louie Gohmert.
But, as H.L. Mencken wrote a century ago, “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.” And haven’t we been getting quite good from our most democratic body of late?
Sorry—I came to praise Boehner, not to bury him.
Two praiseworthy qualities of the statesman come to mind: the aforementioned tears, of course, and being the living embodiment of the establishment-strikes-back that, like the Galactic Empire, didn’t quite stick the landing.
“Praise the Republican establishment?” you might ask. “Doesn’t that contradict everything you stand for?”
You’re probably right dear reader, but allow me to try weaseling out of this one.
Let me be clear: Establishmentarianism is a multisyllabic and dangerous disease, observed at epidemic levels among certain populations—K Street, Capitol Hill, other Named Places in the District, Harvard undergraduates. After all, why rock the boat when it’s actually a yacht?
To overextend the infectious diseases metaphor, small amounts of normally fatal disease can occasionally be useful—like how the bacteria that causes botulism is used in the Botox used for facelifts!
All that is a long-winded way of saying that the brand of establishment that Boehner embodied, the old-boys-club attitude so often vilified, is much, much preferable to the Tea Party and Freedom Caucus up-and-comers who’ve fractured the House and the spirit of its poor caretaker. Yes, trading whiskey and cigars in smoke-filled back rooms isn’t the best way to decide government policies, but I’ll take any option that involves people actually sitting in a room together.
Among the most popular—and destructive—logical fallacies that have come into political vogue is the idea that one can outstubborn one’s opponents into submission, the idea that President Obama will defund his health care plan the 200th time around, that Iran will give up all its bargaining chips if you stare at it and stomp your feet hard enough.
Boehner, a sturdy abortion-disliking, gay-marriage-hating, red-meat Republican himself, stood against this wave of pigheadedness, and for that the ultra-right despised him and made his speakership hell.
And then there are the tears. Politics is the sport of scripted spontaneity, the fabrication of connection with voters with as much sincerity as LinkedIn requests. And yet, when Boehner cries, his innocent, childlike displays of emotion are without desire for political gain or strategy. The man just loves, among other things, children, the Holy Father, and America.
In an arena saturated with sleaze, grease, and grime, those tears were water, pure and simple water. And I’ll miss that.
So there you have it, folks: an entire column’s worth of praise for a bona fide Republican.
You owe me $10, Aaron I. Henricks ’16.
Idrees M. Kahloon ’16, a Crimson editorial executive, is an applied mathematics concentrator in Dunster House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations honored Governor Nikki Haley, Republican of South Carolina, with an award of appreciation for her role in the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of South Carolina’s capitol. This past summer, nine churchgoers and clergy were murdered in a mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston by Dylann Roof, an avowed white supremacist. That tragedy prompted a renewed push to end South Carolina’s display of the Confederate battle flag. The emblem first flew over South Carolina’s Capitol dome in 1962—a signal of the legislature’s disapproval of the civil rights movement—until 2000, when it was moved to the State House grounds. On July 9, Governor Haley signed a bill that finally ordered the flag’s removal.
Governor Haley deserves credit for her display of leadership in a very troubling time. After the shooting, some politicians, including Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, avoided taking strong stands on the Confederate flag issue. Governor Haley’s full-throated insistence that the flag be removed—she called it a “deeply offensive symbol of a brutally offensive past”— played an instrumental role in building consensus in the state’s Republican Party. South Carolina is a better state, and the United States is a better country, with the flag down. Insofar as Governor Haley brought this about, she deserves credit.
And yet, as one Crimson op-ed writer has already noted, there is a strong argument that Governor Haley’s evolution on the Confederate flag came too late. Just last year, she refused to answer a question on the same topic, suggesting that the flag was a non-issue. And the very fact that the Harvard Foundation, or anyone else, considers this vote an achievement on Governor Haley’s part tell something unsavory about the state of racial politics, in South Carolina and nationally. Similarly, though Governor Haley’s role in the flag debate was crucial, other politicians and activists played significant parts in retiring the flag. Plenty of figures also deserve their fair share of credit.
But however we apportion accolades, last summer's debate over the Confederate flag—overdue though it was—cannot be the end to any conversation about race in America. One hundred and fifty years after the Civil War, vast racial disparities continue to exist in the United States, and government policy is often complicit in perpetuating them. These disparities manifest themselves in poverty rates, in health care access, and in restrictive voter identification laws that, intentionally or not, are far more likely to impinge on the right to vote of minorities. (South Carolina’s laws are sufficiently strict that Governor Haley’s predecessor was once turned away at the polls when he, as governor, failed to show up with the proper identification cards.) These are the issues of race relations that should deeply concern Harvard students and faculty; as Governor of South Carolina, Haley has all too often been on the wrong side of them.
It’s hard to talk about race without taking stands on government policy, whether that policy consists of flying a flag or refusing to expand Medicaid. It should also be contended that even if we view many of her policies as ultimately harmful, Governor Haley's personal story itself demonstrates progress against systems that disempower people of color . Reasonable people can disagree about which government policies are appropriate measures for redressing a long history of racial discrimination. We believe, however, that Governor Haley has too often supported policies that have disproportionate and negative effects on communities of color. The Governor deserves her due praise for her stand on the Confederate flag. We now hope that her views become attuned to more pressing issues of racial injustice in other areas of policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suddenly losing its old site, the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Mission Hill After School Program has relocated to three centers in Roxbury for the foreseeable future.
MHASP, Boston’s oldest student-run after school program, found itself scrambling this past summer after it abruptly lost the space it had previously occupied at the Maurice J. Tobin K-8 School. The group intended to use the space for its programming again this school year, but about two weeks before the program was slated to begin, the school informed its leaders that the space was no longer available.
Dominique A. Alpuche ’17, a Mission Hill co-director, said her understanding is that the school wanted to focus its resources on its own students.
When contacted for comment, the Boston Public School media office said in a statement to The Crimson that the sudden termination was due to the expansion of a program to accommodate additional instruction time for Tobin Students. They said that the decision was in no way a reflection of the quality of the Mission Hill program.
Alpuche said that the Tobin School’s principal gave her the news about two weeks before the program was due to start, which forced the directors to scramble to find new suitable accommodations.
Alpuche said that students browsed the Internet to find local venues, in addition to reaching out to organizations with which they had prior relationships and to PBHA and Mission Hill program alumni.
Finding and transitioning to the new locations presented a large logistical challenge to the program’s organizers, said Alpuche, since each age within the program needed its own space and supplies. Most significantly, occupying three spaces has forced MHASP to spread its resources and staff more thinly.
The program now operates from the Thomas Johnson Community Center, ABCD Parker Hill Fenway, and the Mission Hill Health Movement.
Despite these initial obstacles, the program has now settled smoothly into its new locations, Alpuche said; both students and counselors have acclimated quickly to their new surroundings.
Alpuche said that the relocation was not without its silver lining, as it made the directors and counselors more organized.
“The logistical challenges associated with the move forced us to be more planned out and specific in our day-to-day running of the program,” she said.

UPDATED: October 6, 2015, at 1:46 a.m.
The graduate student unionization effort at Harvard has launched a website that celebrates its recent affiliation with the United Auto Workers and provides graduate members answers to a number of technical questions about the movement.
The website, harvardgradunion.org, appears to be part of a greater attempt to recruit new members to the effort. The organizers have also held card drives and used existing platforms such as the Graduate Student Council to recruit new members and promote their cause.
On the website, the group’s leaders strike a hopeful tone about achieving University recognition, even though Harvard President Drew G. Faust has said she does not support the movement. The National Labor Relations Board has also upheld private universities’ choice not to recognize graduate student unions, which the site acknowledges.
“Once recognized, we will sit down with the Harvard administration and bargain as equals about our jobs, the effects they have on our lives, and the effects they have on our students,” the website’s home page says. “Collective bargaining can mitigate many of the precarious features of graduate employment and enable to focus more on quality teaching and research.”
The website also provides a list of questions and answers about the process of unionizing, the benefits of a union, and the technicalities about legal barriers, dues, and negotiations.
“HGSU-UAW is an organization of graduate workers joining together to build power, create a democratic workplace, and negotiate to improve our working conditions and secure those conditions in a binding contract that cannot be unilaterally changed by the university,” the site says.
According to the website, some of the unionization effort’s more concrete goals include timely payments, improved insurance packages, better family benefits, a grievance procedure, protections against sexual assault, and subsidized public transportation.
The site also introduces members of the unionization effort to outsiders. Some information includes the years, departments, and reasons for wanting a graduate student union.
For example, Alex J. Ocampo writes, “from one mathematician to another: Albert Einstein believes in unions and so do I.”

As a student organizes an initiative for incoming freshmen to ease the transition to Harvard academics, administrators are examining whether the College should also offer a pre-college academic bridge program.
A newly formed Bridge Committee, chaired by associate director of advising programs Sue Brown, will discuss how the program might work and has submitted its initial report to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. The program would focus on how to help freshmen better navigate their courses and assignments.
The committee’s report follows discussions led by Savannah N. Fritz ’17, who last semester received funding from the Undergraduate Council to form a similar academic transition program. 
Since administrators and students have similar goals, both groups said that they—along with the Advising Programs Office, First Generation Student Union, and other interested groups—may collaborate as the projects move forward.
“There is definitely institutional interest in the same ideas I had,” Fritz said.
Brown said students and administrators may work together to determine how a bridge program would fit into the College experience.
“All I can really say is that student input will be very important to whatever conversations take place in the future,” Brown wrote in an email on Friday.
Brown declined to comment further on the specifics of the committee’s initial report, citing the confidentiality of discussions and the time needed to give Khurana “a chance to review the report and its recommendations and decide next steps,” she wrote in an email last Tuesday.
Prior to the Bridge Committee’s discussions, Fritz received a grant from the UC to get another bridge program—dubbed the Freshman Enrichment Program—up and running. Working with a budget of up to $3,000, Fritz plans to organize a student board to take charge of the project and subsequent focus groups to solicit data, she said.
“We invite any student...to tell us what were your experiences like in transitioning to college, what would have helped you to have a smoother transition here,” Fritz said.
Daniel V. Banks ’17, a co-chair on the UC’s Student Initiatives Committee who voted for Fritz’s project, said the FEP would fill a need on campus.
“The point of it is to—when we enter Harvard—put everyone on a similar playing field,” Banks said. “Whether you come from a small public school in rural Pennsylvania or a world-class private school, we want to make sure that students are academically prepared.”
As Fritz moves forward backed by the UC’s funding, Harvard administrators have not named a strict timetable for creating and implementing an on-campus academic bridge program, whatever form it may take.
“We want to do whatever we’re likely to do well,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. “It’s more important to get it right than to meet some kind of deadline.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After concerns over a lack of support for BGLTQ students in Dunster House came to a head last spring, the House has made an effort to address those issues this fall by hosting multiple events geared toward BGLTQ students and instituting a formalized budget for BGLTQ-specialty tutors. 
The changes come after students and tutors spoke out last year about Dunster’s lack of residential tutors who identify as bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, or queer, prompting top College administrators to look into their concerns. Students and tutors also lambasted the House for the small number of events for BGLTQ students with no formalized budget and House Masters Roger and Ann Porter’s decision not to rehire Avik Chatterjee ’02, a tutor who students praised for his role as an advocate and ally. Along with concerns about the lack of House resources, students also cited a widespread perception that the House was less welcoming to BGLTQ students.
This semester, however, since Dunster residents filed back into their recently renovated House, some have noticed a similarly renewed approach to House-sponsored BGLTQ programming. And notably, unlike last year, Dunster this year hosts residential tutors who openly identify as BGLTQ.
Gregory K. Davis, a first-year tutor in Dunster, is both a designated race relations and BGLTQ tutor. When interviewed for the job last year, he said students gave him the impression that “resources and events and activities were lacking in Dunster and that a change was needed in the future,” referring to BGLTQ programming.
Just about a month into the school year, Dunster’s BGLTQ tutors have hosted at least two events, according to Davis, who said there has been “definitely a renewed push” for them and other resources. The House has also allocated an official budget of “a couple hundred dollars” for BGLTQ events, said Davis, who added that more funds could be made available as needed.
The House hosted a brunch, titled “BGLTQ Brunch at Dunster House: Celebrate Bisexuality!” in late September, and tutors College-wide advertised it over multiple House email lists.
Davis said Dunster also hosted a beginning of the year BGLTQ smoothie-making event. Davis added that the Porters—who had previously been criticized by students in an anonymous survey for a perceived lack of visible support for BGLTQ events in the House—attended the event and spoke with students for about an hour. The Porters did not respond to a request for comment about new BGLTQ initiatives in Dunster.
“It’s definitely been a very good vibe; people have been much more open than I could have even imagined,” Davis said.
Students in the House said that the House generally seems to be moving toward becoming a more welcoming place for BGLTQ students.
Carl E. Rogers ’16, who previously voiced concerns about BGLTQ life in Dunster to House administrators, said the House has reacted to his feedback in tangible ways. Among other changes, Rogers said there are now stickers expressing support for BGLTQ students displayed on doors in his entryway.
While Rogers had previously said there were perceived inequities in both the visibility and availability of BGLTQ resources at Dunster as compared to other Houses, he said Dunster has mitigated the inequality.
“I did what I could, and this is the change that we got out of it,” Rogers said. “I think things are different, and concerns were listened to and acted upon.”
Alejandro R. Ashworth ’17, a student who helped organize a petition to reinstate Chatterjee as a tutor in Dunster last spring, said “things have been progressing.”
“People are trying,” Ashworth said. “The bisexuality brunch was very visible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen Zunes, coordinator of the program in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of San Francisco, evaluated the United State’s defense of Israeli actions in the conflict with Palestine in terms of international law and human rights in a seminar at the Belfer Center on Monday.
He cited the United State’s reaction to the Goldstone Report, an initiative of the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate possible war crimes or violations of international law in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as evidence of U.S. bias towards their Israeli allies.
Goldstone, the Report’s primary investigator, is Jewish, a Zionist, and a longtime supporter of Israel, which Zunes said was a testament to the Report’s unprejudiced nature, Zunes said. However, Congress rejected the Report as “irredeemably biased” in a vote on the 2009 document; Zunes said this demonstrates that “the apparent intent by Congress and the Administration was to ensure that war criminals be allowed to escape prosecution,” Zunes said.
Zunes also questioned the willingness of members of Congress more generally to trust others in investigating their Israeli allies.
“The US support for human rights and international law in those investigations has been uneven, but only recently has Congress gone on record by such an overwhelming bipartisan margin to discredit,” Zunes said.
Zunes also argued that Israel has committed war crimes in the conflict against Palestine, although he did not deny that Hamas, too, has been guilty of violating international law. His intent was not to “unfairly single out Israel for criticism,” but rather to argue that Israel cannot claim immunity from the consequences of its actions.
The U.S. may have acted out of self interest in defending Israel, since it, like Israel, employs a loose definition of “terrorist,” according to Zunes, and wants to avoid setting a precedent that could restrict its future actions.
“[The U.S.] is essentially going on record that massive killings of civilians are legitimate as long as you are fighting terrorists,” Zunes said. “This provides a blank check for U.S. forces, and by that matter, Russian, Syrian, and any other forces for greater atrocities in the future.”

Experts discussed the different ways the environment can impact health to a crowd of students and members of both the Harvard and greater Boston communities gathered in the Geographical Lecture Hall on Monday.
The event, entitled “How Does the Environment Affect Our Health?”, was presented by the Harvard Museum of Natural History in conjunction with the Harvard T. H. Chan Center for Health and the Global Environment.
The first of three featured speakers, John D. Spengler, professor of environmental health and human habitation, spoke about the impact of air pollution on human health. Citing a study that compared the health and mortality of residents in six different cities across the U.S. with varying levels of air pollution, he said that there was inherent link between particulates in the air and health.
Spengler also drew attention to the link between climate change and human welfare—a link that, he said, is sometimes lost in the greater discussion.
Assistant Professor Joseph Allen and Program Leader Julia Africa, both from the Harvard School of Public Health, each discussed the relationship between one’s environment and mental health.
While Allen focused on the effect of the indoor environment in the workplace on health, well-being, and productivity, Africa spoke on how mental health and stress levels are positively impacted by being present in nature.
“A natural environment may be more restorative or more soothing than the relatively more modern incarnation of our built environment now particularly with its materials and sensory cues,” Africa said.
Jesse R. Marrow, a sophomore at Northeastern University who attended the event, said he was drawn by the discussion’s position at the intersection of environment and urban design.
“I’m very interested in the environment, climate change, and also sustainable design. Up until today, I never though about the health impacts,” Marrow said. “It was great to hear a lot about as we progress with sustainable, urban design, how we need to think about health with everything we are doing.”

Students in “The Empire Strikes Back: Science Fiction, Religion, and Society,” a joint History of Science and Divinity School class, gathered together to watch the course’s namesake film on Monday night. This screening was the first in a film series designed to run alongside the course.
The most recent lectures in the course have been focused on the “Golden Age of Science Fiction,” said Sophia Roosth, associate professor of the History of Science. She said the “The Empire Strikes Back,” the second film in the Star Wars series, connects strongly with the idea of the cowboy space epic, portraying the American frontier in outer space.
“The idea behind the course is to think of science and science fiction as sharing a sort of rhetoric,” she said. “One of the things that science fiction allows us to think about is how we can understand present circumstances by placing them in future contexts.”
She, along with Ahmed Ragab, assistant professor of Science and Religion at the Divinity School, who also teaches the class, said they assumed this was a movie many students had already seen. But while the screening started off with fewer than 20 students, many more members of the 70-person class streamed in and out as the movie progressed.
Ragab said the movie captures the relationship between science and religion that the course explores, with features like “the force,” which represents an alternative way of dealing with and understanding the world in the film.
Divinity School student Al-Jawhara H. Al-Thani pointed to the question of technological might versus natural forces as a theme of the course that the film also poses.
Al-Thani, as well as Finn H. Quigley, another graduate student, said they grew up watching Star Wars and enjoyed the reminder of their childhood.
“It’s definitely not something you would normally find in any kind of academic institution, and I like that,” Quigley said. “The professors are fantastic—both are very knowledgeable and interested in the subject.”
Ragab said part of their approach is keeping the class fun for the students as well as for the instructors. He also said teaching the history of science and religion through investigation of science fiction is meant to develop the students’ critical thinking.
“Cultural artifacts around us are not to be rejected but to be understood and analyzed,” Ragab said. “There is nothing shameful about being a fan of anything in pop culture.”

While women's soccer junior Midge Purce took home the Athlete of the Week honors, three Harvard athletes finished still managed to stand out as runners-up for Athlete of the Week. The trio each contributed significantly over the weekend, helping their teams emerge victorious.
Kathleen Wallace, Women's Volleyball
The senior outside hitter racked up a total of 13 kills in Harvard’s match against Penn. Wallace’s performance guided the team to its second win in Ivy League play as the Crimson prevailed in straight sets, 3-0. The San Francisco, Calif. native also tallied four digs and four blocks in the contest, and she finished with a .370 hitting percentage.
In the first eight matches of her final year at Harvard, the senior is averaging career highs in kills per set, digs per set, as well as a career-high .251 hitting percentage. As women’s volleyball continues its conference play, Wallace figures to play an important role in the team’s quest to repeat as Ivy League champions.
Jake Freeman, Men's Soccer
In Harvard’s 3-1 victory over Yale on Saturday, it was senior forward Jake Freeman who netted the game-winning goal. With his 63rd minute score—a diving header past the Bulldog keeper—Freeman put the Crimson up for good to lead the team to its second win of the year.
The native of Melville, N.Y. has built on impressive freshman and junior-year campaigns and has already recorded six points in the team’s first eight games. Freeman has impressed in the spotlight, having scored in one of two draws against nationally-ranked opponents and having tallied the game-winner in each of the team’s wins.
Noah Reimers, Football
Reimers ran 15 times for a total of 64 yards on Friday in Harvard’s 45-0 shutout of Georgetown and ended up in the end zone after three of them. The freshman running back now leads the Ivy League with five rushing touchdowns. He is averaging 48.0 all-purpose yards per game and 5.3 yards per carry.
The rookie has seen the field in each of Harvard’s first three games of 2015, and he won Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors in back-to-back weeks for his performances against Brown and Georgetown. With an impressive hurdle of a Georgetown defender on Friday, Reimers earned a spot on SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: October 6, 2015, at 2:43 p.m.
Sometimes you’re in the right place at the right time. Sometimes the ball will rebound off someone’s foot, and you’ll be the one who happens to touch it last before it goes in the net.
One goal can be lucky. Three in a game seldom is.
Junior forward Midge Purce, the team’s leading scorer a year ago and the focal point of the Crimson’s offensive attack, took a total of five shots in Saturday’s 4-0 win over Yale, sinking three of them in the back of the net, the last of which completed her first career collegiate hat trick.
She netted the ball twice in the opening six minutes of play, with the first tally coming 85 seconds into the game. She capped off the hat trick in the game’s 51st minute to add to the team’s insurmountable lead.
But while Purce was the one who recorded the hat trick, she wasn’t the only one responsible for the explosion on the attack. It was her team that put her in the right position eahc time to be able to finish and pad her box score.
“There are a lot of details and patterns that led up to the goals that people don’t really notice,” Purce said. “Rachel Garcia, her pass went to Bailey [Gary], Bailey’s beautiful ball over, she’s been working on that for so long…. I just happened to be the one to touch it last.”
Despite offensive struggles in nonconference play in the early portion of the team’s campaign, Harvard (4-6-1, 2-0 Ivy) has notched six goals in two all-important conference games in its atempt to bring the Ivy League championship to Cambridge for the thid consecutive year.
Three of those goals came in an offesnive onslaught in the opening sequence of the contest against the Crimson’s arrchrival. Purce and junior defender Bailey Gary notched three goals in the game’s first six minutes. The Crimson’s defense kept the Yale offense in check to move Harvard to 2-0 in Ivy League play. The Crimson has not lost a conference game since Nov. 1 of last season.
“We were very excited about this game and that showed from the moment the game started,” senior midfielder Brooke Dickens said. “We came out and scored three goals really quickly. I think it’s just taking what we do in training every week and working really hard.”
This has not been the first time the Olney, Md. native has had an eye-opening performance. As a freshman, Purce finished the season with 11 goals, tied for first in the Ivy League with Yale’s Melissa Gavin, who at the time was a junior. Last year, Purce followed up the performance with 10 more scores. Currently, she leads the Crimson in goals, totaling five of the team’s 11. The junior forward is ranked fourth among goalscorers in the Ancient Eight as well, trailing leader Dartmouth forward Lucielle Kozlov by four goals.
“Midge is a great player and to see her score three goals like that is just incredible because we know she has it in her,” Dickens said. “She really had a great game. It’s the first Harvard hat trick in a long time. Yesterday was really exciting for a lot of reasons.”
During her first year in Cambridge, Purce received the Ivy League Player of the Year award, becoming the first freshman in the league’s history to win the honor. She also won the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award that season. She has been named to the All-Ivy League First Team in both of her seasons at Harvard.
Purce has played in all but one game during her time college career,, and has been a starter in all but five of these 46 appearances. Needless to say, Purce’s presence on the Crimson ove the past two-plus years has been crucial to the team’s success.
The Crimson is currently tied for first place in the Ivy League with Princeton after this weekend’s victory at Yale, well on its way to three-peat.
“I think it’s [the fact that] the unified 27 of us are all focused with our heads in the game that has made the difference,” Purce said.
Excelling at high levels is nothing new for the Psychology concentrator. Purce has been a member of both the United States U-20 and U-17 National Teams. As a member of the U-17 squad, she won the 2012 CONCACAF Women’s Championship in Guatemala, scoring three goals in the team’s three matches while helping the team qualify for the U-17 Women’s World Cup.

Harvard loves its acronyms, and names of classes are no exception: PS1, LPSA, LS1A, CS50, ES50 . . . the list goes on. But who knows about LS50? Is this a new merger between LPSA and LS1A because we didn’t have enough students in pre-med already? Is this EC10’s new method of trying to rebound from the popularity of CS50? Flyby reporters went on a mission to discover the truth.
As it turns out, LS50 is a year-long double course, taking up two class slots per semester freshman year. That’s right, for anyone taking 4 classes each semester, LS50 is literally half their schedule this year because who needs sleep, right? The course is limited to only 25 guinea pigs--we mean students--but Mary E. Wahl, a college fellow who instructs in the course, said that she and her colleagues are looking to expand the course to more students in the future. Students work in lab and also are aiming to produce “novel work” in the course that can lead to future publications. We don't know about you, but we think most Harvard students should aim to have at least one publication by the time they are nineteen. Right?
The class meets every weekday for 1.5 hours, has two 3-hour lab sessions (which will get reduced to one 3-hour lab every week after a while), one 1-hour section every week, and for the first month, a 5-hour lab on Saturdays. If you’re in Math 55 you’ll know that amounts to 19.5 hours a week in the initial weeks of the course, not even counting the time needed for homework and studying. Talk about dedication to science! Most people can’t bring themselves to show up to their 1-hour, no homework seminar. The syllabus has been planned for the entire year, and it amounts to roughly 125 lectures. One student, Audrey H. Effenberger ‘19, spoke to us about how the course was markedly different than her high school biology courses because it was less about memorizing facts and more about how everything fits together.
Luckily, after interviewing students and faculty, we determined that all parties involved are thoroughly enjoying the class and don’t consider it to be a burden on their time. Jett P. Crowdis ‘19 said that he is mostly taking a class for a challenge. When asked what the most rewarding and challenging parts of the course were, Daniel Shen ‘19 said, “the most challenging part might be the most rewarding part” highlighting that although this course is a tough one, the students wouldn’t want it any other way because it’s Harvard.
While Saturday labs from 1 - 6 may sound daunting to the rest of us, they are apparently one of the things the students love most about the course. Two of them spoke about the bonding time they have with their peers in those sessions, and said that it’s been a lot of fun. We have yet to determine whether this constitutes an exclusive enough group to create a new Finals Club. If it does, we think it should be called The Final FINAL club: LS50.
Of course, there are some inevitable difficulties in this great endeavor. Crowdis ‘19 mentioned that connecting different ideas from lecture and checking for understanding might be challenging. However, even though there is a lot of material, “the professor are doing an excellent job doing it,” providing outlines and conveying ideas through the class or the TFs. Effenberger ‘19 also commented, saying that “pacing on some of the topics could be improved."
Students uniformly said they wanted to take the course because of an already-present interest in the sciences, and they were intrigued by the integrated, multi-disciplinary aspect of the course. #LiberalArts
Demystifying LS50 convinces us that this course is overall very cool; everyone involved is enthusiastic and excited, and thoroughly dedicated to teaching and learning about science. Rock on, LS50!

Humanities 10, lovingly called Hum10, is one of those classic Harvard classes students wake up for in the morning and think, ‘Ah, I love the smell of a liberal arts education!’
All jokes aside, Hum10, in Professor Alison J. Simmons’ own words, is “an evolving beast.” This is the first year Humanities 10 has been offered as a replacement for the required freshman Expos course. (There’s a way to get out of Expos?!) Curious about this new freshman track and the class that’s been garnering so much attention, we spoke to students currently in the course and Professor Simmons to find out more:
When asked why he had wanted to take the course, Nick D. Horneado ‘19 replied that “the main one [reason] was how scary it the course seemed.” Students read a book every week, and acceptance into the course relies on an application process at the start of the school year.
Indeed, the workload for this class is no joke - those of you looking to get easy Gen Ed credit (you know who you are) are out of luck. Professor Simmons said that when selecting students for the class, they expect that students consider it to be their main course. However, the class seems to be a success - much like every senior can ‘objectively’ say that their House was the best, the students Flyby interviewed uniformly shared their excitement about the work that they would be doing. It appears this may be the only class at Harvard in which students are actually doing their reading.
