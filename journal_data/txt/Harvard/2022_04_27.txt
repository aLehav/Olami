After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tender, exhilarating, and soulful. It’s a descriptive triumvirate that aptly sums up the artistry of one of the world’s greatest animators — and the towering global franchise that followed in his wake. Yet beyond these common characterizations, the precise source of his films’ enduring allure remains elusive.
What sets Miyazaki apart necessarily begins with the question of what seems distinct about his characters. Many of the most iconic scenes from the animator’s extended repertoire are ones that involve transformation. Some of these scenes are endearing or whimsical; others border on the grotesque. In “Ponyo,” a tiny aquatic humanoid by the name of Brunhilde, who later adopts the titular name of the film, uses magic to grow limbs in an attempt to become more human. In “Porco Rosso,” the titular protagonist — a former World War I fighter ace — is an anthropomorphic pig. One of the most disturbing scenes in “Spirited Away” is when ten-year-old Chihiro’s parents transform into animals after gorging on food in an abandoned amusement park.
What joins these disparate films is their intimate portrayals of how acts of transformation shape a person’s understanding of belonging and self-awareness. In “Ponyo,” Brunhilde’s acts of magic-induced metamorphosis are a currency of defiance, a way to communicate to her family a desire to escape her watery lair and inhabit the world of humans. Porco’s identity as a pig heightens his reservations about whether he can ever revert back to simpler pre-war times. Chihiro, terrified by the prospect of losing her parents, steps gingerly into the dreamlike world of Kami — spirits from Japanese Shinto folklore — in hopes of securing an antidote. In his richly surreal film “Howl’s Moving Castle,” Miyazaki’s protagonist Sophie is transformed into an old woman by the evil Witch of the Waste, and she communes with the mysterious sorcerer Howl in an attempt to regain her youth.
Miyazaki is not simply interested in the idea of change, but also what comes after it. Rather than the mere moment of transformation, the auteur is committed to chronicling his characters’ labored efforts to return to an original or prior state. For some characters, the desired return is to a physical body; others yearn for a previous worldview or state of existence. What unites these eclectic gestures is the retrospective awareness they activate: Only through the psychic and spiritual rupture of transformation are Miyazaki’s protagonists able to fully regard who they once were, and what they once had.
In one way or another, each of Miyazaki’s films features the dueling motifs of transformation and return. Yet we often step into these stories with the understanding that a total return to the past is, all too similar to in our real lives, impossible. It is the desire to turn back despite an awareness of this act’s impossibility that renders Studio Ghibli films interesting and frequently melancholic.
The affective and aesthetic impact of a Miyazaki film lingers for hours, days, even years after the screen cuts to black. Yet as we sit dumbstruck in our seats, watching the credits roll, a part of us understands that the wisdom his cinema confers is elusive, delivered in a wash of awe that starts to fade the moment we realize it has begun.
Miyazaki’s brilliance — not just as an artist, but also as a feeling human — lies in his ability to evoke the sensation of someone, transformed and adrift, reveling in the vast beauty of a new world while searching for a way back home. It is a feeling we all come to inhabit at some point in our lives; it is a complicated feeling, but a simple one, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In more ways than one, anime pervaded my childhood.
In elementary school, it was “Pokémon” in the basement on Saturday nights. Enraptured as I peeled tangerines, I watched Ash Ketchum battle mythical creatures and gym bosses in his indefatigable quest to “catch ‘em all.” When middle school came around, I angled my iPad screen just so and snuck bits of “Future Diary” between worksheets on the Pythagorean Theorem. Four years later, on the night before the SAT, I sipped broodily on a mocha in a cafe, absorbed by a dramatic confrontation between Naruto and Sasuke in the pouring rain.
Each era of my life has corresponded to different shows, different obsessions. When rewatching a favorite, I can recall distinctly the landscapes and people, the anxiety and aspirations, that marked the period I first watched it in. Anime has become an accidental way of assembling a chronology of my past.
It’s no surprise that anime followed me to Harvard. The summer after my freshman year, I rewatched “Tokyo Ghoul” on the Korean subway, looking up intermittently from my phone as the crystalline blue of the Han River rushed thousands of feet beneath me. As a sophomore, I crammed “Hunter x Hunter” between readings of Derrida and Fanon, howling in my dorm at 4 a.m. because the two protagonists’ relationship reminded me so much of the one I have with my own twin.
I enjoyed the genre for more reasons than one. I watched because it was at once entertaining and ridiculous (it was often entertaining because it was ridiculous), and because there were seeds of unorthodox creativity and joy within that ridiculousness. I watched because it provided a complex amalgam of melancholy and humor that I found lacking in many of its Western counterparts. I watched because it was at times very childish and, moments later, startlingly wise.
Mostly, though, I kept coming back to anime because I was able to watch it with minimal guilt. Looking back, it’s clear I bought at least partially into the normative view of anime as a second-class form of entertainment. While films or artful shows demanded a sit-down ambiance and one’s undivided attention, anime episodes rarely exceeded 20 minutes. They could be crammed in before a meal, or post-shower, or between readings. When waiting in a winding queue or between subway stops, I killed time with an episode. Even with a busy schedule, I told myself I was only watching anime to fill dead time.
***
Like a good deal of the people around me, I had picked up the habit of using a vocabulary steeped in contractual and violent terms — “dead,” “kill,” “waste” — to describe the ways I related to and managed the bits of my time I found impractical, that failed to yield visible indicators of output or progress. I rationalized my penchant for anime accordingly.
Some may wave away any serious attempts to deconstruct our shared temporal semantics. But the truth is that the implications of the language we use to describe how we spend our time — the word “spend” itself implying a measurable currency — are patently clear. As a society, we fear unfilled time. And as we do with most things that evoke fear, we choose to regard it as something to subdue, rather than to exist in communion with or flow in.
Keeping with this logic, I should have felt occasionally miserable, or at least anxious, when watching anime. After I turned off my phone or closed my laptop, I had nothing to show for the twenty minutes (or forty minutes, or three hours) I had just “wasted” watching pixelated figures rush across the screen. Yet I often felt buoyant and content, sometimes even intellectually revitalized. I had wasted my time and had had damn fun doing it, and was ready to reapply myself to whatever task stood before me.
Of course, sometimes I did feel guilty. In middle school, my parents would drive us, five-strong, to Wisconsin for a weekend. If I woke up early, I followed my father to his favorite cafe in town, far more endearing than the Starbucks milling with tourists. Inside, vintage bicycles gleaming olive green and mauve hung from the burnished planks on the walls. I always had the same order: a chocolate-chip pumpkin muffin and a hibiscus tea. Then, while my father graded exams, I watched Kirito battle bosses to clear floors of Aincrad and Kaneki decimate ghouls. I slouched in our shared booth, nose to screen, peering over sheepishly at his pile of essays on the implications of international trade.
In the hours I had spent with my screen, I could have been reading or writing, or chasing projects, or having conversations with family or friends. Instead I had done, as I occasionally bemoaned to those who were sympathetic enough to listen, “nothing.”
In retrospect, however, it became clear that the moments spent “doing nothing” were vital, even formative. They allowed me to simply exist, to thoroughly indulge in an activity not because it was a stepping stone toward a greater or more marketable purpose, but rather for the sheer fact that it was fun. They helped me resist — and, eventually, critique — the urge to articulate an actionable reason for everything I did. Watching anime permitted me to take charge of my own interests and desires.
***
As I became aware of how watching anime helped me escape a perverse relationship to “empty” time, my understanding of other activities, like writing, also shifted. During vacations in high school, I recall sitting at cafes in Korea, doing nothing. After buying a drink, I would open a blank document and stare at the blinking cursor, its methodical line and non-line.
The cursor represented an exciting and at times terrifying potentiality: By writing, I could create something. I could build out an idea that reached people, that might even change them in some important or unimportant way.
The notion at once energized and disquieted me. I would sit in the cafe for hours, literally watching as the sky changed color. People flitted in and out. A couple fought. Friends shared a cappuccino, magenta lipstick staining the rim of the glass. A toddler trounced in, spilling four cups of free water, and his mother arrived minutes later to scoop him up. I observed them lazily from behind my laptop as she scowled at his drenched jeans.
Contrary to what it seemed, I was hard at work, absorbed in the exacting labor of observing the dynamism of ordinary life. Those days on vacation in the Korean capital doing “nothing” resulted in an at times illuminating but mostly frustrating stasis. There was so much I wanted to say and document, to celebrate and question, but my fingers wouldn’t move. I felt tired, even though I hadn’t done much of anything as I packed up my laptop and went home for the day.
***
Broadly speaking, I actually was doing work by watching anime: I was thinking and visualizing, passing judgment and making connections. The work, however, was markedly interior. Correspondingly, the resulting output of that work was reserved for myself, and its actualized value would take time to come to fruition, often in unforeseen ways: A scene I had watched months or even years back would help me start drafting a poem, or choose a color for my new phone, or lend obscure insight into a gnarly civic problem we were discussing in class.
If there is no tangible output from an arbitrary period of time we afford ourselves, we call this time “throwaway time.” As with so many things, we cannot resist the temptation of steeping this time in a language of morals: These are fundamentally insignificant moments, we tell ourselves, moments that can and should be discarded or forgotten about. Yet it was precisely the times I had once dismissed as useless that were often the most grounding and humane. They allowed me to decompress and imagine, to reposition and rest. They didn’t demand from me an output that was visible or otherwise legible to the broader world I inhabited; the time was valuable not because of what I produced, but because I had chosen what it was I wanted to do with it.
At Harvard, we speak of time in terms of mastery and fear. In an effort to optimize for maximal productivity, we choose to look past the exceedingly intuitive fact that humans don’t function like well-oiled machines. Of course, it’s hard to resist the urge to conduct one’s own life like an experiment from time to time — and exhilarating when, for a brief moment, that experimentation works. Inevitably, though, there comes a relapse. Despite our improved output, we find ourselves feeling empty or depleted, and begin questioning what the punishing diligence we demanded from ourselves was really for.
My love of anime has afforded me countless moments of leisure, humor, and joy. It is also, however, a rejection of our collective impulse to discard time that does not give us what we demand of it. The moments spent alone, laughing or crying about things no one else witnessed or understood; the unremarkable hours that, looking back, made the difference. When I talk about anime, I am talking about time.

As the second day of the 2022 Coachella Music Festival came to a close and the fatigue began to set in for the tens of thousands of festival-goers, something exceptional was needed in order to recover the energy lost throughout the weekend. Twenty-year-old superstar Billie Eilish accomplished not only that with her set — she also delivered the best performance of the three-day festival.
From the very beginning of her set, Eilish’s stage presence was unbeatable. As the lights display flashed and “bury a friend” began to play, she strutted across the stage, making sinister faces and contorting her body into uncomfortable positions to the driving beat. Pictures of demons flooded the screens, and high-pitched screeches supplemented the track's sinister melody.
Eilish utilized the stage design effectively to facilitate engagement with the audience. During “I Didn’t Change My Number,”she spat all over the stage, literally marking her territory. Similarly, “NDA” saw her slowly walk up and down the catwalk, tilting her head back to orchestrate creepy dance moves. Background dancers in full-body latex suits floated in from stage left and marched across the stage like troops in a militia. On their cue, the tone shifted from one of creepiness to a semblance of sensuality.
Continuing with this more risqué tone, “NDA” blended into “Therefore I Am” as Eilish made her way to the center of the catwalk, directly in the center of the crowd. As the bass synth chords reverberated, Eilish slowly got down on her knees and grinded on the stage for a brief moment as the fans next to her on the catwalk screamed profusely. With the help of her knee pads, Eilish stood up and returned to the main stage to continue the firecracker set.
In addition to her expansive utilization of the slanted platform that served as her stage, the  set design itself was unique to Eilish. Halfway through the show, Eilish stepped onto the tiny platform she’s been using throughout her bigger post-pandemic concerts, which was then raised into the air and rotated 360 degrees above the crowd. As she stood thirty feet in the sky, the entire audience caught an unobstructed glimpse of her, creating one of the coolest concert experiences of all time. Engulfed in light like an angel, she beautifully sang “ocean eyes,” projecting a melodic sweetness onto the crowd below her.
What truly made Eilish so enjoyable to watch, though, was her candid charisma: her humor, relatability, and kindness defined the night. She talked with the audience and wasn’t afraid to be goofy. For example, she made sure to remind the audience of her three rules: “don’t be an asshole, don’t judge those around you, and — most importantly — have fun, bitch!” Later, following “Getting Older” from 2021’s “Happier Than Ever” — which included a sentimental display of family photos — Eilish accidentally face-planted on the stage and recounted “I just ate shit up here  . . .  I tripped on the fucking fire thing.”
Thanks to her deliberate audience engagement and fun personality, Eilish’s performance was rife with incredibly memorable and sentimental moments alike. She often walked over to her brother, who performs under the name FINNEAS and playedo guitar and piano for Eilish’s set, confessing to the crowd about how her musical journey would be impossible without him. After Paramore’s Hayley Williams came on stage for a surprise performance of Paramore’s 2007 hit “Misery Business,” Eilish embraced Williams in a huge hug and rejoiced in their friendship. In another demonstration of love for her fans, Eilish delivered a speech about being accepting of everyone in our world while hoisting a pride flag.
Closing with the iconic sonic journey that is “Happier than Ever,” Eilish brought an end to an extraordinary concert. Her gorgeous, soft vocals flooded the main stage, and fans sang along in total unison. The sheer emotion in the space was astonishingly overwhelming in that moment: a communal atmosphere where everyone present was compelled to throw their hands in the air as if testifying to a gospel choir. A gleeful celebration ensued when the beat switched to welcome the faster, more punk-inspired portion of the track. The drums, guitar, and Eilish’s lead vocals combined with the audience’s screams to provide a perfect send-off to the second day of the festival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most Asian Americans, racism isn’t being hit in the back of the head with a crowbar in New York City. It isn’t the violent horror stories you see in the news. To many of us, racism is mundane. It’s unremarkable. It’s simply a passing part of day-to-day life. It’s a low hum in the background that we have learned to tune out over time.
I can still remember when I made this realization: the first time I was called a slur by a stranger. It was only a few weeks ago, at 9:30 p.m. I had just finished eating at a Korean restaurant in Allston with a group of five friends. Five of us, including myself, were Korean; the last member of our group was Chinese. Within 50 feet of exiting the restaurant and stepping out onto the dreary sidewalk, I saw a pair of white men, cladden with sweatpants and unkempt beards that showed hints of whitening. They were smirking casually, almost drunkenly. As we passed, they offered each of my friends and I a small nod and sloppy, slurred “ni hao.”
First came the bewildered confusion. Quickly after, though, came the anger. I began to feel a burning in the bottom of my chest, but as I began to raise a righteous finger in protest, my friends lowered my hand. After we took a few more steps, one of them told me, “it’s not worth it.” As we stopped at the corner up ahead to wait for the crosswalk light to change, I turned to my friends and said, “I can’t believe that just happened.” My friend turned back towards me, eyebrows raised, and remarked, “you haven’t been called the c-word before?”
The most surprising part of the whole incident, to me at least, wasn’t being labeled Chinese by a stranger with zero prompting (and to be clear, there’s nothing wrong with being Chinese; the problem is the deliberate belittlement of my Korean heritage by diminishing all East Asians to simply “Chinese”). I knew that being racially insulted was only a matter of time once I returned to the U.S. I was surprised by the nonchalant reactions of my friends. To them, this was normal — hardly worth addressing. As we stood at the crosswalk, the mood was somber, but the topic of conversation quickly moved on. Within a minute, it was as if the past few moments had never happened. We never talked about it again.
In retrospect, I realize that the reason this was my first time remembering being called a slur is because I moved from New York to Korea in eighth grade. In other words, I had left the states before I really understood what it meant to be called a slur. For minorities in America, however, slurs are just a part of life. Even as I’ve been writing this op-ed, a Chinese friend came up to me and informed me that he had been called out with racist comments more times than he could count.
The Asian American experience with racism isn’t just the muggings or shootings you see on the news. After all, the two men didn’t get in our faces. They didn’t follow us as we passed by. They didn’t shove any of us or throw a punch. The Asian American experience with racism is the fact that I wasn’t all that surprised by randomly being labeled Chinese. It’s the way that my friends treated the incident as if it was hardly worth mentioning and how we’ve never talked about what happened afterwards. It’s how in the face of blatant, explicit racism, my friends’ instinctual reaction was to internalize it and pretend it never happened. The Asian American experience with racism includes the fear of escalation that prompted my friends to lower my hand, not just the violence that may have resulted had they not done so. It’s a fear that is mundane and omnipresent: a faint, usually unnoticeable worry that permeates all aspects of life.
To many Asian Americans, racism has become a normalized fact of being. It’s not always — in fact, it’s usually not — as explicit as it was that night in Allston. The way I usually encounter racism is when people ask me if I’m a U.S. citizen even after hearing my perfect English for an entire conversation. It’s when I think back to when a classmate complimented how smart I was in third grade and I’m no longer sure if it was a comment based purely on my merits as an individual. It’s a less visible kind of racism than the hate crimes that make the news. It’s also a less terrifying kind of racism, but an exponentially more tiresome one. It adds a tiny weight to every aspect of your life; even though the added weight is usually unnoticeably small, when it’s aggregated over every day and every week, it becomes exhausting. It’s a quiet, subtle kind of racism, but one that is utterly inescapable: a kind of racism that you fail to notice until you are called a chink by a stranger in Allston and — like a crescendoing wave — it hits you all at once.

In just a few days, the Harvard Undergraduate Association will hold its first elections. They will be its first sin.
To understand this requires understanding how we arrived here. When the roiling controversy (and outright bigotry) that met the proposal to replace the Undergraduate Council ended with the HUA’s resounding affirmation by over three-quarters of students, there was a sense of finality. Just like that, they were gone — the self-righteous UC careerists, the racists that supported them, the hated, moribund form of a decades-old body known for bureaucracy, ambition, and little else. These are the kinds of victories that we like to believe inaugurate real change.
But it hasn’t. The HUA suffers from precisely the same structural flaw that ruined all of its predecessors, from the original sin of student government: that we elect it.
In some sense, student government represents us. Its constitution says so. The sickly-sweet overseriousness of its campaigns looks like real representative politics.
But the core of representation lies in the people doing the representing. In a community as small as ours, government is personal — unlike in national politics, we have the privilege of knowing who represents us and the values they hold. The people are the soul of student government. And they continually fail it.
They are not, to be sure, all or even mostly bad people. Intentions aside, they do hard, thankless work that has kept clubs funded and delivered valuable initiatives. But, at a school chosen for resources and prestige, student government can seem the shiniest trophy in an embarrassment of riches. High stakes, a grueling campaign process, and the thankless work that comes after form a powerful mechanism for self-selection. Elections for any Harvard student government invariably choose at least a handful of people who are calculating and insincere. They, most prominent of their peers, define the institution.
Totally irrespective of how it performs, then, students dislike and reject our student government because they feel that it does not represent us, that its values and methods fundamentally diverge from ours. That’s how a student government that made Lamont an overnight library, established the blue-light alarm system, centralized online information about clubs, and delivered summer storage dies — because policy comes second to character when the scale is personal.
This is the original sin of student government, and it taints the body from the moment it comes into existence.
Though our institutional memory seems hazy on this point, it has doomed every student government that has come before this one too. In 2019, a UC abolition campaign declared “a campaign to end campaigns”; in 1983, a UC representative hoped to “eventually abolish the Council”; in 1965, the Student Council, from which Dunster House seceded, was abolished, a development foreshadowed by a 1950 petition contending that "there is nothing that the Student Council does which would not either be done better by someone else or be better not done at all.”
The problem is endemic.
Buying into the technocrat’s hope — the blind belief that a smarter, newer system will succeed where all others failed — is foolish, ahistorical, and will ensure that this campus goes on hating the generally decent people that govern it while periodically tearing the whole thing down.
To break this sordid chain of failures demands a clean break, a solution that aligns the student body with its representation by making them one and the same. The most democratic, most representative student government is one that doesn’t hold elections at all.
Instead, students would be far better served by a number of official, entirely volunteer-based advisory bodies focused on particular issues facing the student body (mental health, social life, etc.). Such a model would untether representation from willingness to campaign and eliminate the poisonous electoral self-selection that has destroyed every student government to date. These bodies would work within our community to advocate for students, interface with administration, and spearhead voluntarist initiatives that directly, meaningfully improve student life.
The mental health group, for one, could coordinate with student counseling organizations to help the Dean of Students Office overhaul our hole-filled mental-health support system. The social life team might apply for funding to hold school-wide social events like Yardfest for example.
Club funding, meanwhile, should be transferred to a new, independent, application-based student body unswayed by politics and invulnerable to dissolution. The chaos of post-UC, pre-HUA club funding attests that this change is long overdue.
The HUA got some of this right, but the original sin remains. In reducing the number of elected positions, the HUA begins a more furious race for the prestige of just nine spots. On its inaugural ballot, you will find a powerful testament to this stasis masquerading as change: Four of the six tickets vying for HUA co-President feature long-time members of the UC.
The original sin of this school comes with awkwardly fitting a fractured template for representative government from the outside world onto a community small enough to lead itself cooperatively. To absolve it, we must choose something different, better — a politics of direct democracy, of personality, and of action.
Our history, because we fail to learn it, repeats itself. For this failure, the moment it is born, the HUA will fate itself to die.

It’s the last day of classes, our board plus has finally started to run out, and we’ve reached that special time of year when everyone is really nice to Eliot students in the hopes of getting invited to Fête. But as the semester winds down, I can’t help but notice the increasing number of slanderous whispers making their way through these hallowed halls. Harmful allegations are being levied against some of the most integral and long-established members of the Harvard community, and it’s high time we talked about it. So here it goes.
Why is everyone hating on bees?
The rebukes are relentless. At every turn, students viciously proclaim, “these bees are killing me,” and “omg for real, this bee ruined my GPA,” and “I hate bees.” The bullying has to end, and as Harvard’s premier entomological columnist, I have a unique responsibility to correct these defamatory rumors. So here’s the truth. Bees are not murderous villains sent to destroy your GPA. They’re winged insects, tired of being misunderstood.
And to all you first years who still aren’t on board – I get it. Bees are scary, especially if you’ve never seen one before! But consider this a warning. Massachusetts is home to a large and diverse bee population, so before the semester ends, it’s highly likely that a significant number of these creatures will find a permanent home on many Harvard transcripts.
So if you happen to meet your first bee this semester, don’t despair. There’s nothing inherently bad about them. In fact, bees are a natural part of college environments and are known to play an essential role in an organism’s growth! It’s only in mistaking these bees for a representation of our worth that we come into any real harm. (But don’t worry; even if your bee stings, the pain usually subsides within a day or two.)
Contrary to popular belief, bees don’t magically appear at the end of the semester – they take time to grow and develop. So if it looks like a bee is creeping onto your transcript, it probably started developing a long time ago. Think back to the beginning of the semester. Did you skip lecture because the five-minute walk was “too far?” Did you copy pset answers from your unsuspecting lab partner? Did you foolishly assume that Gradescope deadlines were “suggestions?” If so, your bee has been a long time coming. (That’s what happens when you wing it!) But let me be clear, the issue here lies not with the bee, but with the cavalier lack of effort that went into it.
Although bees have a bad reputation on campus, there’s nothing inherently wrong with them! In fact, many individuals perform hours upon hours of labor in the hopes that they might be lucky enough to successfully obtain some. The scientific community calls these individuals “beekeepers.” Here at Harvard, we call them “chemistry majors.” As these students know, bees are often born from the hard work of a difficult semester. So if you suspect a bee might take residence on your transcript and you’re not sure how to feel about it, ask yourself these questions: did you “give it your all” this semester? Did you devote yourself to learning and growth? Were you academically challenged? If so, then celebrate your bee! You worked hard for it, and its honey should be delicious. But if you were like,“Eh, Harvard has grade inflation so I don’t need to do the assigned reading. Let’s go play beer pong.” Then go stand in the corner and think about what you’ve done.
Stepping away from the bee metaphor for a moment, I think it’s prudent to mention that grades are a poor indicator of academic growth to begin with. If you worked as hard as you possibly can and earned a Bee, then congrats! You should feel proud of your personal growth and hard work. Conversely, if you got a 4.0 GPA, but didn’t learn anything or cheated your way into it, then the accomplishment is empty. True learning is about personal growth, and grades can be misleading.
Now coming back to the bee metaphor, there’s one more thing I need to address. It is no secret that Bees are an endangered species. Bees are so endangered, in fact, that some people claim it’s nearly impossible to earn one on Harvard’s campus, what with all the problematic inflation. On behalf of all Harvard students, I want to say that I wholeheartedly agree. Harvard needs to do everything it can to increase the number of Bees on campus. Just, you know, not to me. Never to me. Bee to everyone else, yes.

To our readers:
Today, The Crimson chose to dedicate our front page to the memory of the individuals enslaved by leadership, faculty, staff, and donors at Harvard University.
The people recognized on the page are only those whom Harvard was able to identify. As Tuesday’s landmark University report on the legacy of slavery at Harvard says, this is “almost certainly an undercount.” For these people, we often know only their nicknames; for a few, we know only their race and gender. This is the result of the systemic erasure that to this day continues to deny enslaved people their histories.
Writing their names as best we know them, we are reminded that history is not just a collection of facts. It is a collection of stories. Behind each name was an individual: a brother, a mother, a wife, a son — a human. The forefathers of Harvard didn’t recognize their humanity, and shackled them in slavery. Today, we must reckon with the knowledge of this atrocity.
At Harvard, we frequently encounter the names of enslavers like Mather and Winthrop. We rarely encounter the names of the individuals they enslaved. Today, as copies of the paper are distributed across campus, we hope to change that. We hope our readers will spend time with the issue and sit with these names — perhaps even say them aloud.
Sincerely,
Raquel Coronell Uribe ’22-’23
President of the 149th Guard
Jasper G. Goodman ’23
Managing Editor of the 149th Guard

A pair of long-lost trophy oars dating back to the Harvard-Yale Regatta of 1852 will be put on auction at Sotheby’s in May and are expected to sell for up to $5 million.
The oars, made of black walnut wood with silver engravings, were awarded to Harvard by future United States President Franklin Pierce after Harvard’s boat, named the Oneida, won against Yale’s boat, Shawmut, by four lengths in a two-mile race. The regatta marked the first American intercollegiate competition.
“College sports in America is a uniquely American phenomenon. There's no other country in the world that is so passionate in their fan bases for collegiate sports, and [the oars are] really the beginning of that,” said Richard Austin, Sotheby’s Global Head of Books & Manuscripts, in a communication with Forbes.
The contest — known as The Race — predates even Harvard and Yale’s football rivalry, which witnessed its first matchup over 20 years later in 1875.
In the listing for the oars, Sotheby’s called the 1852 regatta “the very inception of organized American intercollegiate sports, now a pillar of the college experience.”
“The camaraderie and intense rivalries born out of the intercollegiate spirit shape not only students’ and alumni’s lives, but have come to define the world of American sports—and American culture at large,” the listing reads. “These rivalries are legendary.”
The auction will be conducted online from May 17 to May 24, where the oars are expected to rank among the most valuable memorabilia in all of American sports history if they were to sell for $5 million. The Olympic Manifesto — the foundational document of the modern Olympic Games — holds the current record, having sold in 2019 for $8.8 million.
The existence of the oars was unknown until a family in Medford, Mass., found them thirty years ago in the basement of a rooming house they purchased. Since their discovery, the oars have remained in the family’s private collection.
The Harvard-Yale Regatta is the longest running intercollegiate athletic competition in American history, held annually since 1864 except during major wars and pandemics. Since 1878, the race has traditionally been held near New London, Conn.
The 2020 and 2021 regattas were canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The next Harvard-Yale Regatta will be held in less than two months on June 11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council elected Carlos A. Gonzalez Sierra, a joint-degree student at the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School, as its new president on Monday.
Gonzalez Sierra, currently a third-year in the joint J.D. and masters in public policy program, said he believes he will be the first Latinx president of the Council. Harvard Divinity School student Mayank D. Kumar will serve as vice president of the body.
Gonzalez Sierra edged out one opponent, community engagement chair and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Landon A. Fortenberry. The vote tallies were not made public.
“The overarching goal is to make HGC a more effective body, and I will focus on three areas: one, supporting student-driven advocacy initiatives; two, fostering inter-school collaborations and connections; and three, strengthening the internal operations of HGC,” Gonzalez Sierra said.
In his candidate speech, Kumar, the incoming VP, said he has “the right attitudes and skills to thrive in” the position.
“I am going to assist the activities of the council with humility, integrity, safety, and focus on really listening to the body and students, and doing the best I can to advocate for students,” he said.
The Council voted on six other positions, but only some were filled. Three positions — operations chair, governance chair, and information chair — will remain vacant until the fall, when Council representatives will vote in another election.
Harvard Extension School student Mir Jahanzeb “M.J.” Mehdi, who joined the meeting via Zoom, was elected as the body’s finance chair after originally running for four positions. Mehdi and Anthony J. Donahue both ran for chair of governance, but neither was elected to the role.
Gonzalez Sierra said he is “very confident” the empty positions will be filled in the fall.
“Since we didn’t fill them now, they will just be open then and we will actually have new people — new blood — coming in from the different graduate schools, so I expect to have a wide variety and a very diverse board coming in,” he said.
Prabhroop K. Chawla, a student at the Divinity School, was elected as co-chair of programming after running against Extension School student Ambria K. Jones, who was subsequently voted as the next co-chair of student well-being. The Council will elect the remaining co-chair positions in the fall.
Outgoing HGC president Peter Choi praised Gonzalez Sierra’s work over the past year, likening their relationship to former President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden.
“He’s phenomenal and he’s smart — he’s engaged, he’s always been there, and super dependable,” Choi said. “Can’t be more thankful, and can’t be more excited that he’s taking this on.”

Harvard committed $100 million to redress its ties to slavery after a historic report released Tuesday found that slavery played an “integral” role in shaping the University.
The report — written by a team of 13 professors commissioned by University President Lawrence S. Bacow in 2019 — detailed Harvard’s history with slavery over three centuries and included seven recommendations for the University to “take responsibility for its past” and “leverage its strengths in the pursuit of meaningful repair.”
In an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday signed by every member of the Harvard Corporation, the school’s top governing board, Bacow accepted the report’s recommendations and announced the creation of the $100 million fund. Bacow wrote that some of the money will be made available for immediate use, while the rest will be held in an endowment to sustain efforts long-term.
“I recognize that this is a significant commitment, and for good reason,” he wrote. “Slavery and its legacy have been a part of American life for more than 400 years. The work of further redressing its persistent effects will require our sustained and ambitious efforts for years to come.”
The seven recommendations in the report “seek to remedy harms to descendants, to our community and the nation, and to campus life and learning,” the committee wrote.
The report recommends that Harvard continue to publicly acknowledge and research its ties to slavery; engage with direct descendants of people who were enslaved by Harvard affiliates; and partner with other schools and nonprofit organizations to eliminate inequities in education stemming from centuries of slavery, with a focus on the American South and the Caribbean.
Efforts to identify direct descendants are ongoing, Radcliffe Institute Dean and Committee Chair Tomiko Brown-Nagin said in an interview Monday.
“We believe that Harvard’s intellectual, reputational, and financial resources should be marshaled in its efforts to remedy the harms of the University’s ties to slavery, just as past representatives of Harvard deployed these same resources and caused harm,” the committee wrote.
Harvard’s efforts follow commitments by peer institutions to address historical ties to slavery. In 2020, Brown University permanently endowed a $10 million fund to finance high-quality educational opportunities at Providence, R.I., public schools, which serve a large number of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Georgetown University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Glasgow, among others, have similarly established endowments and scholarship funds.
The report called on Harvard to partner with other institutions, particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The committee recommended the creation of a new exchange program for juniors at Harvard College and various HBCUs and encouraged the provision of financial support to enable HBCU faculty to go on sabbatical.
The committee’s recommendations extended beyond higher education. The report also suggested Harvard provide high-quality educational opportunities “to support historically marginalized children and youth from birth through high school and college.”
Several proposals encouraged the University to fund projects that engage with Harvard’s legacy of slavery through research, curricula, and “a permanent and imposing physical memorial, convening space, or both.” Acknowledging how slavery in New England began with the enslavement of Native Americans, the fifth recommendation specifically urged Harvard to address its ties to the enslavement of Indigenous people.
Former Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow will lead an implementation committee to realize the report’s recommendations, Bacow wrote in the Tuesday announcement. The new committee will decide how the $100 million fund will be spent, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University released a landmark report on Tuesday that detailed the school’s extensive ties to slavery.
The 130-page report, which comes two years after University President Lawrence S. Bacow launched the Presidential Committee on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery, documented how the University was shaped and supported by the institution of slavery.
Here are five key takeaways from the long-awaited report.
The report found that slavery existed directly on Harvard’s campus.
“Over nearly 150 years, from the University’s founding in 1636 until the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found slavery unlawful, Harvard presidents and other leaders, as well as its faculty and staff, enslaved more than 70 individuals, some of whom labored on campus,” the report reads.
Enslaved people lived and worked at the school, feeding and caring for generations of students and faculty, the report said.
Harvard faculty, staff, and donors enslaved over 70 individuals, according to the report. At least five Harvard presidents — Benjamin Wadsworth, Nathaniel Eaton, Increase Mather, Joseph Willard, and Edward Holyoke — owned slaves.
Dozens of prominent donors and University leaders also enslaved people, the report found, including at least 10 members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
At least three people who enslaved individuals on Harvard’s campus served as stewards at the school — a prestigious position in the early years of Harvard College “that commanded respect and status,” according to the report. Between the University’s founding in 1636 through the beginning of the American Revolution, only 10 men held the position — five of whom were from the same family.
The work done by people enslaved by Harvard stewards “maintained the Harvard campus and sustained Harvard students,” the report said.
Andrew Bordman II, who served as a steward for more than 40 years “stands out for having enslaved at least eight individuals,” according to the report.
Here is a full list of Harvard affiliates who were identified as enslavers:
Harvard had “extensive financial ties” to human bondage via benefactors who amassed wealth from slavery. During the first half of the 19th century, the report found, more than one-third of the money donated or pledged to the University by private individuals “came from just five men who made their fortunes from slavery and slave-produced commodities.”
“Harvard’s donors in this period—and their wealth—were vital to the University’s growth,” the report said. “They allowed the University to hire faculty, support students, develop its infrastructure, and, ultimately, begin to establish itself as a national institution.”
Harvard also amassed wealth through investments in industries that depended upon the labor of enslaved people.
“For roughly a century, Harvard had operated as a lender and derived a substantial portion of its income from investments that included loans to Caribbean sugar planters, rum distillers, and plantation suppliers,” the report said. “After 1830, the University shifted its investments into cotton manufacturing, before diversifying its portfolio to include real estate and railroad stocks—all industries that were, in this era, dependent on the labor of enslaved people and the expropriation of land.”
Harvard leaders and scholars also provided intellectual justifications for racism through debunked “race science” and eugenics.
Prominent Harvard professors including Louis Agassiz, John Collins Warren, and Jeffries Wyman all aimed to provide evidence supporting “race science.”
“From the mid-19th century well into the 20th, Harvard presidents and several prominent professors, including Louis Agassiz, promoted ‘race science’ and eugenics and conducted abusive ‘research,’ including the photographing of enslaved and subjugated human beings,” the report said. “These theories and practices were rooted in racial hierarchies of the sort marshalled by proponents of slavery and would produce devastating consequences in the 19th and 20th centuries. Records and artifacts documenting many of these activities remain among the University’s collections.”
Agassiz, whose name can be found across Harvard’s campus and the greater Cambridge area, was one of the country’s leading proponents of “race science.”
Academic work at Harvard “provided an intellectual framework to justify the exclusion and marginalization of Blacks that would endure into the 20th century,” the report said.
Donors who profited off of slavery and slave owners themselves are honored across Harvard’s campus today with plaques, statues, and buildings.
Two of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate houses — Winthrop and Mather — are named after slave owners. Winthrop House is named after Governor John Winthrop and his direct descendent, Harvard professor John Winthrop, Class of 1732, who enslaved several people during his time at the University. Former Harvard President Increase Mather, Class of 1656, who enslaved at least one person, is the namesake of Mather House.
Eliot House is named after Charles W. Eliot, the longest-ever serving president of Harvard, who “promoted eugenics and endorsed racial segregation,” the report said. Lowell House is named after former Harvard President Abbott L. Lowell, who sought to exclude Black and Jewish people from Harvard.
“Lowell’s perspective on questions of race — rooted in racial hierarchy and eugenics — shaped campus life,” the report said.
Several other buildings on campus — including Wigglesworth Hall, Stoughton Hall, Leverett House, and the Dudley Co-Op — are named after relatives of slave owners.
Many other notable donors and school officials who enslaved people and profited off of slavery are also comemorated across campus.
“Still today, early Harvard benefactors who accumulated their wealth through slavery are memorialized throughout campus in statues, buildings, student houses, and endowed professorships—and indeed in other educational, civic, and cultural organizations across Massachusetts,” the report said.

On the eve of the Harvard Undergraduate Association’s inaugural officer elections, six co-presidential tickets outlined their visions for the new student government in a virtual debate hosted by the Harvard Political Union Tuesday.
With a paltry turnout of just a few dozen attendees, the debate marked a return to the low student participation level that largely defined the elections of its predecessor, the Undergraduate Council. Prior to the debate, a trickle of students turned out to a candidate meet-and-greet event, held in Harvard Hall due to inclement weather.
The debate, moderated by Shang Wang ’24, solicited the tickets’ plans for funding disbursement, communications, and special initiatives.
Running a satirical campaign centered around the minting of an “H-Coin” cryptocurrency, Ian M. Espy ’23 and Ishan A. Bhatt ’23 challenged their opponents to commit to changing the title of “co-president” to one of less prestige.
“We’ve watched for three years as the race for the title has caused people to throw away being lighthearted and kind,” Espy said. “If you win, will you commit to changing the title of president?”
Most candidates reported they were open to a change.
During the debate, several of the tickets also committed to leveraging the HUA’s financial power for cultural initiatives.
LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24, whose ticket was endorsed by former UC President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 Tuesday night, said they would prioritize cultural organizations when distributing club funding, a staple function of the body.
“[Cultural organizations] will be receiving a majority of club funding and we call on the other candidates as well to make that same promise and that same commitment,” Estabine said.
Esther Xiang ’23 and Yousuf A. Bakshi ’23 said, if elected, they would advocate for the creation of a multicultural center.
“It’s more important than ever that we’re focusing on inclusion and belonging, and one of those ways is actually being able to build a multicultural center,” Xiang said.
If elected, Xiang and Bakshi said they would use HUA funds to rent a space in Harvard Square to serve as a multicultural center in the meantime.
Maria F. De Los Santos ’24 and Zachary J. Lech ’24, a Crimson arts editor, said they would prioritize the creation of a space for Black students at the College.
“Even though I agree definitely with the multicultural center, I, personally, as a Black Latinx woman, feel like starting off with the Black house,” De Los Santos said.
Jeremy J. Rasmussen ’24 and William R. Scheibler ’23, another satirical ticket, reiterated their plan to embezzle HUA funds.
“For so long, we have been focused on the dishonesty of past politicians,” Rasmussen said. “I will not do that. I will commit right now; I'm going to embezzle the money.”
In a race where two-thirds of the tickets feature former UC members, the composition of the HUA’s leadership was also a topic of debate.
“Should individuals from the abolished UC be leading the new HUA?” Wang asked toward the end of the debate.
In response, Kimani E. Panthier ’24 and Lisa R. Mathew ’24, cited their time on the UC as evidence of their commitment to first-generation, low-income students.
“We have run several programs to help FGLI students get MBTA passes to attend classes at MIT, to visit Boston to run errands,” Panthier said.
Xiang and Bakshi, who both resigned as UC members, portrayed their resume as an advantage.
“Anyone and everyone who has genuine interest in making a change on campus should be able to run,” Bakshi said.
“It's really important, I think, to also have past experience,” Xiang added.
Estabine, who campaigned for the UC’s dissolution and helped draft the HUA’s constitution, highlighted this experience in her response.
“I was on the UC, but I also took the UC down,” Estabine said. “Yes, I served on the UC, but I also helped in this transition process and I think that makes Travis and I really well-positioned to bring this to fruition.”
De Los Santos expressed her view that former UC members should not be heading the HUA. De Los Santos’ running mate, Lech, previously served on the UC.
“I personally think no,” De Los Santos said. “If it’s the same people from before, is it really a new government?”
The virtual debate’s Zoom chat also featured comical student input, including from anonymous audience member “Remy the Cat.”
Voting for co-presidents and the seven other elected officer positions opened early Wednesday morning and will close at 11:59 p.m. Friday.

Last Sunday marked the end of a historic record-breaking season for Harvard women’s water polo. The Crimson finished with the highest number of victories and lowest number of defeats in program history, bested rival Princeton for a third time in the semifinal, and advanced to its first championship game, where the team ultimately fell to No. 7 Michigan.
“This team is the best women’s team I have coached at Harvard,” head coach Ted Minnis stated confidently. “I am very proud of our group … and playing in a championship game was pretty special.”
No. 17 Harvard (23-7, 9-3 CWPA) began the weekend with a decisive 16-0 win against Mount Saint Mary's (8-24, 1-11 CWPA). The shutout from junior goalie Zoe Banks and freshman goalie Anne-Charlotte Gillard was the second this season – the first also from Banks against Mount Saint Mary’s at the start of conference play in February – and the third shutout in the Crimson’s varsity history.
“It was really exciting to see [the shutout] happen and also really exciting to be a part of it,” Gillard said. “We went into Mount Saint Mary’s knowing that they weren’t very tough competition but that [the game] was really important for setting the tone for the rest of the weekend.”
That confidence carried into the next day, where the squad locked in an 11-9 victory over its rival, No. 20 Princeton (20-10, 8-4 CWPA). Saturday’s win was Harvard’s third consecutive victory over Princeton, a definitive change of pace from the Crimson’s 0-4 record with the Tigers prior to this season.
Though Princeton closed the gap slightly in the fourth quarter, Harvard maintained a comfortable three to four point lead for a majority of the game. Junior attacker Evan Tingler tallied three goals, and senior center defender Inde Halligan, junior center Grace Thawley, and freshman attacker Erin Kim scored two each. The squad started off strong and was able to put pressure on the Tigers from the first quarter while maintaining their usual solid defense.
Against a challenging opponent like Princeton, the team needed more than just their excellent gameplay and coordination between defense and offense. Tingler highlighted the importance of the mental game, and noted that a confident mentality – which she’s seen develop considerably since her freshman year – was a critical factor in toppling their rival.
“Coming in after COVID … [we realized] this is a blank slate and an opportunity to make Harvard women’s water polo whatever we want it to be,” Tingler said. “We were like, ‘this team right here is not going to lose to Princeton,’ and no longer are we a team that loses to Princeton every time. In fact, it’s the opposite.”
The win sent the team to their first ever championship game, where they faced off against No. 7 Michigan (26-8, 12-0 CWPA). Despite an incredible effort and a strong defensive plan, the Crimson suffered on offense and fell 10-4 to the Wolverines, who were highly favored to win.
“Obviously, Michigan is number seven in the nation, full scholarships, they’re very heavily funded, and they have really really good players from all over the world,” Tingler said. “We needed to shut them down defensively and so we came in with a solid defensive plan, but in that game our offense was lacking.”
Minnis also noted that he felt the team missed some shots they should have made, but emphasized how proud he was of his players and their tenacity while rivaling for the conference title – a high-stakes position they had not played in before.
“It sucks that we didn’t win the championship, but it’s the first time that our women’s program has been in the championship game,” Minnis said. “This team has done a lot of firsts, they’re pioneers."
Though the loss itself was certainly hard, harder still was the conclusion of such a momentous season. Minnis and players alike noted that the truly difficult task was saying goodbye to such an excellent group of players.
“You know it’s going to end at some point but this group is one that I have thoroughly enjoyed coaching and I won’t coach this exact group again,” Minnis said. “So [the loss] isn’t sad, it’s just more sad that we won’t compete together again.”
The team graduates two seniors this year – attacker Quinne Pursell and center defender Inde Halligan – for whom this weekend concluded their collegiate water polo careers.
“We had incredible upperclassmen coaching us and guiding the team,” said Gillard, reflecting back on her first year. “Our teammates served an integral role in helping us succeed this season.”
The team looks forward to welcoming its new members in the fall and continuing that drive and enthusiasm that made the 2022 season so exceptional.
“It’s a very special team that loves each other and fights for each other in and out of the pool,” Tingler said. “We look around in the water and everyone’s smiling, laughing, having a good time with each other. It’s just really special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, April 25, Jordan Field was electrified by the presence of over 2,400 fans as the No. 12 men's lacrosse team toppled the No. 3 Princeton Tigers. Alumni, fans, and families were there to celebrate the team’s 2020, 2021, and 2022 senior classes, and the energy they brought was pivotal in the team’s victory. The win catapulted Harvard into a five-way tie with Yale, Brown, Princeton and Cornell for first place in the Ivy League and set the stage for a pivotal game against the Bulldogs this upcoming weekend. It will be the last contest of regular season play, a matchup between two historic rivals with massive title implications.
“It’s an epic rivalry in every sport in Division I athletics. Going down there, it might be their senior day as well. I think that it is just another chance to get better, another chance to compete, and maybe give us a chance to keep on playing,” head coach Gerry Byrne stated.
Of the Ancient Eight lacrosse teams, all but Dartmouth rank in the top 20 of Division I. This upcoming weekend of play will determine which four teams qualify for the Ivy League Tournament to determine the conference champion. The qualifying process will be a hard-fought battle that comes down to not just win-loss percentage, but the quality of those wins, timing of the wins, as well as a number of other statistical factors. There is no clear number one team in the league, with each program making a run at different points throughout the season.
On Saturday, Harvard struck first on a goal from first-year midfielder Owen Gaffney, who drove down the left alley before burying it in the back of the net. The first quarter saw both teams compete evenly, and by the last whistle Princeton was on top 5-4. Princeton picked up momentum at the start of the second, scoring four straight to make it a 9-4 lead. However, the Crimson chipped away at the lead, gaining some steam with goals from first-year midfielder Miles Botkiss to break the run, and junior defensive-midfielder Bryn Evans.
Harvard worked well in its sets on both ends. The offense, led by its trio of attackers – senior Austin Madronic, junior Hayden Cheek and first-year Sam King – spread out well, utilized space, and played patiently, not forcing its shots or feeds in the middle.
“We played with confidence. We went into this game knowing that if we played our game the right way we were going to come out with a dub. And that’s exactly what we did. So, we executed our gameplan,” Botkiss noted.
The middies had a great impact on offensive movement, and a number of players stepped up with impactful plays in pivotal moments. Byrne emphasized that a key to the team’s success was the cohesion of younger players alongside veterans. This was clear in midfield play, with first-years Andrew Perry and Lucas Hillsenrath working alongside players like junior Isaiah Dawson and senior Charlie Olmert to facilitate ball movement from the top.
“We had a lot of players step up and make big plays when we needed them today, and in the past couple tough games we haven’t made big plays when we needed them. Guys like Lucas Hillsenrath came up huge in the fourth quarter. [He] hadn’t taken a shot the whole game and then … sealed the game with a game-winning goal,” Olmert said. “This was emblematic of the whole game, guys stepping up and making plays when called upon.”
On the other side of the field, the defense, which showcased the communication of first-years Tommy Martinson and Collin Bergstrom , as well as junior Chase Strupp, played one of its strongest games of the season. The unit did well talking through rotations on the man-down, and had confidence clearing 23 of 26 takes. First-year Ray Dearth and junior Chase Yager were instrumental in clearing the ball across midfield, and played well in their one-on-one matchups.
“I think this game our defense played well as a cohesive unit and our communication was on point; we excelled at our man-down play,” noted first-year LSM Vince Cresci. “After getting stops we were able to push transition through our d-middies which gave us tons of opportunities to push the fast break and get early offense going.”
Senior goalie Kyle Mullin had another standout performance, saving 18 shots at a 53% rate, with many of those being diving plays on the doorstep. He also led the clearing attempts, facilitating both outlets down low and long-bombs across midfield. His leadership was needed in turning around the deficit of the second quarter, and some clutch saves by the senior did indeed turn the tide.
Another senior who turned in a strong last game on Jordan was FOGO Steven Cuccurullo, who had one of his best performances of the season, winning 15 of 28 face off takes. His clamping was consistent, and he was able to dish it out to the wings to make big plays in the scrum. Senior FOGO Kyle Massimilian also came in clutch, winning three for eight.
“Really great bounce back for the faceoff unit. Lots of guys stepped up on the wing. [Sophomore LSM Greg Campisi] played great as always and [Cresci] stepped up and made some really good plays in his first game action which was awesome,” Cuccurullo said.
Cuccurullo had chemistry with wings like Campisi and first-year midfielder Andrew O’Berry, who played both ways in the game. Campisi looked strong in the middle of the field, showing off his crafty back-handed passes and one-handed ground balls, along with junior LSM Ollie Hollo, who yardsaled his Princeton midfielder with a beautiful check at the fifty.
“We did really well on ground balls. We started to defend a lot better at one side of the field and offense was getting the looks all day. Everything was kind of just put together today, it was awesome to see,” Campisi stated.
The third quarter was a hard-fought battle, and Harvard was able to claw Princeton’s lead to just one goal, 12-11. The Crimson, cheered on by the 400 raucous alumni who came to celebrate the team, ratcheted up play over the final fifteen minutes to earn a 19-16 victory. When asked about how fans’ presence set the game over the edge, players Campisi, King, Olmert, and head coach Byrne all emphasized that they had a tangible impact on the team’s energy during its second-half comeback.
“There was the intersection of a beautiful day, with 400 alums, honoring our current seniors and past seniors … I think that the calculus of all that makes you bring an extra level of effort and energy,” Byrne commented.
Campisi emphasized this statement, saying: “When you have the crowd packed, you have all the boys over at one end of the field … it gives you a little push on the back, a little extra energy to make all the plays that matter.”
All is left to play for in the team’s final game of the season on Saturday, April 30. The contest against Yale, which will take place at Reese Stadium in New Haven, Conn. at 2 p.m., will help determine Harvard’s playoff fate. The game will be streamed live on ESPNU.
Said Campisi: “We know we can win any game … against anybody, we just need to play our game. We need to do all the little plays that build up to the big plays. It starts with every man on the roster, from the bottom to the top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team had scored double-digit runs on four separate occasions going into the weekend of April 16-17, earning a victory each time. That came to an end on Saturday, April 16, when the Crimson fell 21-12 to Columbia in a shootout which kicked off a three-game sweep for the Lions. The Crimson extended their losing streak to a season-high eight games.
“We were expecting them to be a good team and they certainly were,” said junior outfielder Hunter Baldwin. “It was a tough series.”
Harvard (14-16, 5-6 Ivy League) followed up the high-scoring loss by losing the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader 9-4 and then dropping the matinee on Sunday 7-3. With the three victories, the Lions (19-13, 10-2 Ivy League) extended their winning streak to an impressive 11 games and improved their conference record to the best in the Ivy League.
The team traveled to New York for the series after an eight-game homestand which included a series win against Brown, a sweep at the hands of Penn, and losses to Northeastern and UMass sprinkled in between. On April 1, the Crimson sat at a record of 11-8 and looked to be one of the teams to beat in the Ivy League. Now, the squad is staring at the wrong side of .500 and looking to rediscover its mojo.
The wind was blowing out toward the outfield at Robertson Field on Saturday, and both offenses reaped the rewards — the Lions were able to build a lead that proved insurmountable. Together, the teams combined to hit seven big flys. As Baldwin put it, “If you put the bat on the ball, it was gonna go.”
Senior starter Jaren Zinn, who had been a reliable innings eater for the Crimson in his previous two starts, was knocked around in the first inning by the Lions to the tune of seven runs. The righty didn’t help himself by committing a throwing error midway through the inning which led three of the runs to be unearned. Zinn came back out for the 2nd inning but was pulled after ceding three more runs; he finished with a stat line of twelve runs (nine earned) and four walks in an uncharacteristically wild outing.
For the next five innings, the mound was mainly manned by first-year righty Tanner Smith, who allowed six earned runs to the Lions before turning the ball over to junior James Fitzpatrick, who finished the bottom of the sixth after allowing four more Lions to score. Only junior righty Pryor Thomas had any success keeping the Columbia bats quiet on the day, and quiet did he keep them: Thomas pitched a perfect eighth and ninth, striking out three in the process.
On the day, the team struggled to play clean baseball on the defensive side, with the pitching staff combining to throw five wild pitches and Zinn’s throwing error being matched by errors from first-year second baseman George Cooper and sophomore shortstop Jake Berger.
Offensively, the team gained easy traction against the Lions pitchers. Juniors Logan Bravo and Will Jacobsen, who play first base and third base respectively, and sophomore outfielder Peter Messervy all hit home runs and had multiple hits on the day. The bats were able to trim an eleven-run deficit to pull within shouting distance in the fifth, when the score was 15-10, but they ultimately fell short of the Sisyphean task of catching up to a Columbia offense that delivered blow after blow.
The second game of the doubleheader lacked the roaring winds or crooked score lines of the first game, but the result was the same in the end, as first-year Lions starter Joe Sheets was able to completely shut down the Crimson line-up for the first seven innings of the game. Harvard rolled out junior righty Tim Williamson, the second man in the three-headed rotation, who pitched three and a third solid innings but was outshone by Sheets.
Columbia showed remarkable consistency between the first and second game: just as they did in the series opener, the Lions hit four home runs off Crimson pitchers and benefitted from three errors by the opposing team in the field. They wasted no time, with left fielder Cole Hage and designated hitter Andy Blake hitting back-to-back blasts to open the bottom of the first inning.
From then on, the Lions never looked back. As Sheets cruised through the Crimson line-up, sprinkling six hits and seven K’s across his seven frames, the Columbia line-up continued to tack on runs so that the score was 9-0 before the Crimson was even on the board. In one particularly frustrating sequence for the Crimson, Columbia shortstop Jacob Phelps came all the way around to score from first on three consecutive wild pitches from first-year righty Sean Matson.
Once Sheets left the game, the Crimson immediately capitalized against the Lions bullpen. Berger and junior catcher Zach Brown both hit two-run homers off reliever Derek Yoo, giving the Crimson some life in the top of the 8th. However, Yoo settled in to get the final out of the eighth and then pitched a scoreless ninth, putting the Lions in prime position to sweep.
In addition to playing lackluster defense and pitchers missing their spots, the Crimson line-up was unable to capitalize on the few opportunities it garnered against Sheets: the squad was 1-3 with runners in scoring position and grounded into an inning-killing double play in the sixth. A bright spot was Messervy, who continued to rake with another two hits in the game.
The series finale had a familiar feel to it: the Lions lept out to an early lead that was preserved through strong starting pitching, and a late Crimson rally fell short. This time, the Lions got it done against the Crimson without putting on a power display, relying on clutch hitting and another string of defensive missteps by Harvard to scrape through with a win.
This time, it was lefty JD Ogden who mowed down the Crimson line-up over the first five and two-thirds innings, holding Harvard to just a sacrifice-fly in the first by sophomore outfielder Chris Snopek that gave the Crimson its first lead of the series. The advantage was short-lived, as the Lions put up two runs in the bottom of the frame via a throwing error by first-year catcher Sawyer Feller and an RBI double by Lions right-fielder Hayden Schott.
Once Ogden settled into a rhythm, the Lions were able to stretch the lead against Crimson junior starter Adam Stone and sophomore southpaw Uday Narrotam, who came in to relieve the staff ace after four gritty innings. In the sixth inning, Narrotam walked the bases loaded with two outs and the Lions clutched up with runners in scoring position, bringing all three runners home to score on a double, single, and a passed ball by Feller.
The Crimson’s last gasp came in the top of the eight, when Berger showed Harvard’s continued affinity for the long-ball with a solo shot to right field, then Messervy scored Jacobsen with a sacrifice fly. Feller flew out with a runner on third to end the inning, however, and Snopek grounded out with two runners on in the ninth to seal the Crimson’s fate.
Despite the string of painful sweeps at the hands of Ivy League opponents, the team’s spirits don’t seem to be flagging, and they brought good energy into a midweek game against Merrimack College (10-21-1, 5-7 Northeast Conference) that finally broke the team’s slump. The 18-2 victory against a weaker opponent could be the spark that the Crimson needs going into the final stretch of the season. Seven of the nine starting hitters picked up a hit, including Baldwin, who went 2-4 filling in for Cooper, who has a mild hamstring sprain from the Columbia series.
“It was fun being the spark plug for the team,” Baldwin said of hitting in the lead-up spot. “A win always feels good, so we’re looking to carry that momentum forward.”
The Crimson followed up the Columbia series and the Merrimack win momentum with a 2-1 series win last weekend as they travelled to Princeton to play the Tigers, winning the last game 14-10 in twelve innings. Harvard then fell to University of Massachusetts Lowell this past Tuesday, April 26, 4-12, but looks to rebound with a three-game homestand versus Dartmouth that begins this weekend on Saturday, April 30, at 11:30am.

Enough talk of the norovirus and the dissolution of the UC! Let’s discuss something fun: where, oh, where can one go to brunch in the Square??? From familiar favorites to the new kids on the block, it’s about time for a fresh ranking on Harvard’s Greatest Brunch spots.
The Countdown 
5. Darwin’s Ltd. 
Necessary disclaimer: Darwin’s is a gem and in no way deserves a last place ranking. But alas, Harvard has some pretty fire brunch spots. Darwin’s menu is filled with tons of fun twists on the classic egg-and-cheese combo, a great coffee bar, and DESSERTS. One small caveat is the limited sit-down options. While there are a few small tables to sit and chat, Darwin’s is overall more of a grab-and-go setting. My order you ask? The Radcliffe – 1 cage-free over-medium egg, cheddar, avocado, pickled onions, & arugula on a housemade biscuit, and don’t forget about a top-notch matcha latte with almond milk. Enough said. Darwins’s close proximity to the Quad is making me pretty hyped to join the Currier community next fall.
4. Tatte Bakery & Cafe 
Tatte’s line consistently spills out onto the sidewalk or is often packed to the door. This speaks to the cafe’s stellar food, extensive options, and great overall vibes. But its popularity is also its very downfall. Brunch becomes complicated when you're sitting at a miniature table fit for approximately half of a person and can barely hear the person sitting next to you. But, outdoor seating is back! Time for a spring Tatte moment. Food? Fabulous. Pancakes? Perfect. Muesli? Magnificent. I’m a huge fan of the shakshuka and their coffee always hits. So Tatte’s only downside is simply the fact that everyone seems to know how great it is. So be it.
3. Life Alive Cafe
Third place goes to the baby of the Brunch Fam! Welcome to the Square, Life Alive! This one might be my personal favorite. With an immaculate ambiance and tons of seating options (upstairs and ~below ground~), you’re almost sure to find a spot. The menu is very exciting and the food quality is top notch. The acai bowls are truly the best I’ve had and the Superfood Waffles definitely give the HUDS Veritaffles a run for their money. Life Alive’s singular flaw is the fairly steep price point. But at this point in the semester, a trip to Life Alive should count as self care.
2. Zoe’s 
Ahhh what a cute classic diner. Zoe’s brings a chill retro flair to the brunch scene, making it the perfect place for a casual catch-up. Thankfully the prices are more college-budget friendly compared to the other places on this list. The all-day breakfast menu is massive – pancakes, milkshakes, omelets, you name it. I’m personally fired up about the idea of Zoe’s “Crunchy French Toast” and a vanilla milkshake on a Sunday morning with the roommates. Are pajamas allowed? I think so.
1. Bluestone Lane 
And the winner is… Bluestone Lane! Immaculate vibes. Lots of seating. And the food? 10/10 rating in my book. My personal favorites are the warm banana bread (I mean…) and the egg x feta x bacon x avocado breakfast burrito. You get the jist. And for all the indecisive food ordering queens like myself, Bluestone offers the perfect solution: their Brekkie Board pairs avocado toast with a cute little decorated yogurt parfait. Still wondering if those flowers are actually edible…
That’s A Wrap… 
Let’s be real – a “week-in-the-life-of-a-Harvard-student” is not as glamorous as our campus vloggers may make it seem. The perfect remedy to revive your tired soul of the past week’s 11:58 p.m. pset submissions and the mounting anxiety of a section cold call is here... and her name is Brunch <3.
