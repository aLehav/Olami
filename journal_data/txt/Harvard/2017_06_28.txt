After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are rats here. Big ones. Stuck following Google Maps on my first night in this part of Washington, D.C., I found myself facing a family of them hours after arriving in the city. It occurred to me that our showdown would be a good test: I’ve heard that it’s important to “challenge yourself” during the summer.
My test of courage went south when I began imagining how, in my CVS-bought flip flops, one of the creatures would bite onto my big toe and send me scurrying to George Washington Hospital for weeks of rabies vaccines. I fled towards the cover of streetlights feeling a mixture of terror and embarrassment. The notion that I needed to do anything other than continue walking at my ordinary pace was, I told myself, “just an emotional reaction.” And sometimes I like to think that my judgments come from a more trustworthy source.
What’s so wrong with emotional reactions? Quite a lot, according to some. Harvard psychologist Joshua D. Greene ’97 has argued that understanding the emotional origin of common intuitions should change the way we answer the most important questions about our moral relationships. Through fMRI experiments, for instance, Greene and others find that individuals using “conscious reasoning” tend to think that we ought to promote the good of the most people, no matter how it comes about, while subjects who favor constraints on promoting some consequences generally do so on the basis of “automatic emotional responses.”
Hypothetical moral dilemmas called “trolley problems” illustrate this distinction. According to Greene, individuals using conscious, cognitive processes favor pushing a person in front of a trolley to save five others. Subjects responding to their emotional impulses, meanwhile, think that doing so is gravely immoral.
Chalking moral reasoning up to “automatic emotional responses” feels disappointing. Who wouldn’t want to be on the side of the “conscious reasoners”? And if Greene is right that our rational processes support rescuing the most people possible, then maybe they also require that I start donating far more of my time and resources to aid others.
But first we need to explain why it is that our “emotional” judgments count for less. Greene argues by analogy that we consider a romantic relationship between adults who eventually discover that they are siblings, but decide to stay together while taking precautions to ensure they remain childless. The logic goes that if our condemnation stems from a historic fear of inbreeding, we should discard that emotional judgment when birth defects are not at issue. Understanding the origins of moral intuitions allows us to see when they are irrelevant and unreliable guides to the situation at hand.
As interesting as it might be for neuroscience to answer these fundamental questions, the psychological research tells us nothing about which moral principles are true in cases of incest or anything else. If someone does think that genetic similarity makes incest impermissible, then she isn’t making a mistake because she trusts her emotions. Her error lies in simply giving an unconvincing account of what makes some relationships wrong and others right.
When we remove the specter of genetic disease from our thinking, we need to explain the wrongness of incest in some other way, or realize that we have no reason to object to it. For example, we might discover that incest is morally concerning when it endangers family structures we take to be important. Or perhaps we will appeal to other concerns about sibling relationships.
In any case, the core questions about the ethical propriety of such relationships are decided not by an appeal to the emotional or cognitive sources of our judgments, but to the kinds of justifications we can give them. If we change our mind about incest in some scenarios, we should do so only because reasoning about the features of such cases supports our conclusion.
Remember the rats? What made my judgment that I was in imminent danger from rats wrong-headed was not (even marginally) the fact that it arose as an automatic emotional response, though it certainly did, but rather the observation that no rat was capable of causing me harm. In some respects, judgments about far more significant topics operate similarly: Our emotions may lead us astray, like anything else, but not because they are emotions. We need to decide how to act the way people always have—without psychological substitutes for difficult moral reasoning. Ethics doesn’t come with any shortcuts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SEATTLE, Wash.—It’s 7 a.m. and I’ve once again beaten my alarm clock at its own game.  I roll out of bed to shower, dress, and grab some breakfast before walking down the street to catch a bus to Bellevue. I can make a Starbucks visit on my walk from the transit center and still be in work comfortably before 9.
There’s really nothing remarkable about this morning routine, unless you know me personally.  I spent most of the last three years waking up with barely enough time to make it to 10 a.m. sections. During the school year, a shower in the morning—rather than before bed—or a leisurely walk from the Quad, are small luxuries. If I can grab coffee from the dining hall as I run for the Shuttle I count myself lucky. I regularly fall into bed after a 1 p.m. class because my brain feels foggy and my legs are like jelly, and I can’t force myself to be awake any longer. Rinse and repeat. Plenty of students at Harvard get relatively little sleep, but few feel this terrible even when they get a regular eight hours.
Five years ago, I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer.  At eighteen, I held onto the straight-forward treatment plan and excellent prognosis to offset the shock of a cancer diagnosis. I told people I was going to be fine, “only” having to have my thyroid removed and take some pills every morning thereafter. The six-inch scar on my neck was promised to fade, and within a year I’d be effectively cured.  In the grand scheme of things, I was lucky.
I minimized the reality of my condition so much I became complacent about it, forgetting that I needed to be more mindful of my energy levels than the average college student.  I spent most of my junior year of college over-worked, unknowingly under-medicated, feeling lousy, and blaming myself for it all. No matter how easy the words “chronic illness” were to say, part of me never really believed they applied to me. I was unkind to myself, forcing myself to keep up with my classmates’ often crazy work schedules. I internalized the idea that sincerely acknowledging the difficulties posed by my illness meant giving in and accepting that I was permanently limited by it.
I worried about this exhaustion persisting into the summer, dreading a long commute across the Puget Sound and fearing that I’d underperform at work.  It took getting out of the Harvard bubble—both physically and mentally—to teach me that I’m not doomed to be tired forever.  Putting in a full day of work during “real adult human work hours” has trained me to sleep longer and earlier than I have since starting college. I haven’t felt this genuinely well in years, and it hasn’t come at the expense of my productivity. Rather than being a permanent consequence of my illness, this perpetual exhaustion at college can be as ephemeral as my time as an undergraduate if I want it to be.
At a time when I’m reckoning with the impending reality of graduating in under a year, unsure how I’m ever going to be okay with leaving Harvard behind and being a “real adult”, this summer has already given me something to look forward to about graduating: sleep.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Cafe Algiers, a Middle Eastern restaurant beloved by Cambridge students and the Harvard community alike for over half a century, will permanently close this August.
Chef Michael Scelfo, owner of Alden & Harlow and Waypoint, will open Longfellow, his third restaurant in Harvard Square, in its place.
The cafe first shuttered its doors last October before reopening under new management a month later.
“We’re sad to see Emile and his team close their doors, but hope to pay homage to Algiers’ 57-year legacy with this new venture,” Scelfo said in a press release.
Emile Durzi, the previous owner of Cafe Algiers, decided to close the cafe because of a longtime illness. Sami Herbawi and Leo Diodato, owner and manager of Central Square’s Andala Coffee House, purchased the cafe and reopened it with minor changes to the menu.
The current owners said the landlord did not want to renew their lease. “There’s no reason for this. We have a good business,” Diodato told the Cambridge Day.
Many students said they were surprised by the second closure.
Waverley Y. He ’18 said she was in disbelief at the news. She prefers getting coffee at Cafe Algiers over other nearby options because the atmosphere there is more “intimate” and “cozy.”
“As a PAF, I took a lot of my PAFees there for meetings and office hours. Whenever exams came around, I thought it was a nice place to kick back,” she said.
Lincoln D. Herrington ’20 said Cafe Algiers quickly became one of his and his friends’ favorite places in the Square, and considers its closure to be “a huge loss.”
“The environment and the group of customers it brought together was interesting. You would hear people discussing philosophy, people talking in other languages—I hope that whatever replaces it will have a similarly cosmopolitan environment,” he said.
Kate Moran ’20, who first visited Cafe Algiers as a summer school student, said she is “really sad” that it is closing and hopes to return for one last Turkish coffee and baklava.
Moran recalls going to the cafe with the intention of studying chemistry, but instead talking with a friend and relaxing. “It’s nice because you can actually sit there for hours and hours and lose track of time,” she said.
Looking forward, Herrington worries that Scelfo’s new restaurant may be “significantly more expensive and less accessible to the population Algiers currently serves.”
“I hope that they still maintain some semblance of a respite from busy Harvard Square life,” Moran said.

Summer is finally here—that time of year when friends are replaced by masses of lost tourists and annoyingly ambitious summer schoolers. It can be tiring to come up with new ways to carpe the diem. But, have no fear! Flyby is here with plenty of ideas for summer plans that’ll make these next few months breezy—without emptying your wallet.
Poke your head around the Square, hop on a train to Boston, or even take a boat ride to the Boston Harbor Islands. If our ideas help you break up your month long Netflix binge, or make you rethink going to Felipe’s again, we’ll consider our job done.
In part one of our series on what to do in Boston and Cambridge this summer, we present to you the best outdoor activities from both sides of—and on—the Charles. (See part two on destinations in Boston and part three on shows around town.)
Paddle down the Charles
Though we don’t have a beach right nearby in Cambridge, the Charles River is not to be overlooked. At rates as low as $15 an hour, you can rent kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, paddleboats, or even rowboats. You really can’t go wrong with row-boating down the Charles (unless, of course, you fall in).
Exercise on the Esplanade
As tempting as it sounds, sitting in front of the AC with a lemonade in hand may not be the most fulfilling “activity” for the next few months. Instead, take advantage of free yoga, running groups, zumba, and other activities offered on the Esplanade in Boston throughout the week this summer.
Wind down with some summer yoga
Now that the days of hunching over desks and laptops are (hopefully) over, it’s time for us all to take a stretch. The Esplanade offers some great (and free!) yoga classes throughout the summer, but there are several other options in the city, too. To get your yoga fix, head to the Frog Pond every Thursday, Assembly Row on Saturdays, or, if you want to splurge a little, the Colonnade’s rooftop pool on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
(Frog Pond: Red Line to Park Street. Assembly Row: Red Line to Orange Line to Assembly. Colonnade Hotel: Red Line to Green Line to Heath Street.)
Enjoy some poolside “you” time
Hotels in Boston (and their pools) are known to be luxurious and, sadly, expensive. Luckily, Flyby has some tips for getting you a relaxing day by a rooftop pool at a reduced price, or even for free! After 5 p.m., public admission to the Colonnade Hotel’s rooftop pool costs just $10, and the Revere Hotel’s rooftop pool is free. Yeah, you heard us right. But have your ID ready, since this access to both pools is 21+ only.
(Colonnade Hotel: Red Line to Green Line to Heath Street. Revere Hotel: Red Line to Park Street.)
Picnic by the Charles…
When in doubt—whether it pertains to summer plans, or just life in general, really—picnicking is always the answer. (“When is it not?” you may ask. When it is raining, that’s when.) This summer, grab a blanket, some food, and a few friends (or not, there’s no shame in solo-picnicking) and wander down to the riverside for a pleasant dining experience. Pro tip: bring a speaker for some tunes, and make sure you avoid the geese.
...or picnic on one of the Boston Harbor Islands
Splurge a little and hop a ferry to one of the Boston Harbor Islands for a chance to explore and to see the Boston skyline from a whole new perspective. Also, make sure you pack (you guessed it) a picnic!
(Red Line to Downtown Crossing. Cruises leave from Long Wharf.)
