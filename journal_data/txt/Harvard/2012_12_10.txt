After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the American presidential race, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made little secret of his support for Mitt Romney. They were old friends. They shared the same deep-pocketed donors. Netanyahu was even featured in Romney campaign ads targeted at Jewish voters in Florida. Israeli parliamentary elections are scheduled for January 22, two days after Barack Obama’s second inauguration, and it’s time for the president to repay the prime minister’s favor. Of course, Obama’s hostility to Netanyahu would have purer motives—to save Israel from a government that has turned that country into a pariah state and is destroying any prospect of a just and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
 
The recent Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations General Assembly encapsulates everything wrong with Netanyahu’s government, a coalition of religious nationalists and out-and-out racists led by his right-wing Likud Party. With significant European backing, the resolution to make Palestine a non-member observer state passed overwhelming despite objections from the United States, Israel, and seven other countries. The Jewish state had a right to be angry: The UN bid arguably violated the Oslo Accords, which prohibit unilateral action by either Israelis or Palestinians. That said, this was an avoidable embarrassment. Last year, the Palestinians attempted the same thing at the UN Security Council, a request nixed by the U.S. Between then and now, the Netanyahu government could have returned in earnest to the negotiating table, if it only had agreed to a halt to settlement-building, an offer that Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, made repeatedly. 
 
In remarks at the Begin Center in Jerusalem, Bibi Netanyahu struck a sanctimonious tone. “It doesn’t matter how many hands will be raised against it,” he said, “there is no force in the world that would cause me to compromise Israel’s security.” Writing off the international community wasn’t enough. He had to double down on the behavior that has paralyzed the peace process, announcing plans the next day to build 3,000 new housing units in the E1 corridor between Jerusalem and the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, which would bifurcate the West Bank between north and south, further entrenching the Israeli occupation. As the left-leaning daily Haaretz wrote, this was “a step that, first and foremost, punishe[d] Israel.” The U.S., which had proven itself a true friend to Israel, issued a stinging condemnation. Five European nations summoned Israeli ambassadors to protest the Jewish state’s actions. Further recriminations are in the offing.
 
Some commentators conjectured that Bibi’s move was designed to gin up his base ahead of the election, after which he would cut a deal. This runs deeper than that, though. Bibi is heir to an expansionist and exclusivist Zionist vision of a Greater Israel that encompasses the occupied territories—and perhaps other lands. While he endorsed a two-state solution three years ago, his government’s settlement binge and legitimization of arguably illegal outposts indicate that he is not a true convert. An ability to overcome the past is the mark of the peacemaker. Menachen Begin and Anwar Sadat had it. Abbas might have it. Bibi probably doesn’t.
 
And that’s where the election comes in. Right now, Likud, which merged with the Arab-hating Yisrael Beiteinu party, is poised to rout a dispirited left beset by infighting. For its part, the Israeli electorate has grown more hawkish since the second intifada. But voters could be won over to the left if Netanyahu is seen as having damaged American-Israeli relations, a matter that bears heavily on their minds.
 
Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert accused Bibi of hurting Israel by breaking for Romney. Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, the peace camp’s last, best hope, said Netanyahu “poked Obama in the eye” by approving settlement construction in E1. President Obama could give credence to both those arguments, and it would be just deserts for a government that thinks friendship is a one-way street. 
 
U.S. action should be targeted at settlement-building, the biggest roadblock to peace. In 2010, The New York Times reported that $200 million in tax-deductible donations were funneled to the settlements by American charities. Removing that deduction would not make a big dent monetarily, but it would send a powerful signal. To ratchet things up, America could condition its loan guarantees to the Jewish state, $3.8 billion of which will be disbursed through 2016, on a cessation of settlement activity, subtracting the amount Israel spends on building from the sum of its guarantees, an idea occasionally floated. Finally, Obama could announce that military aid to Israel—in excess of $3 billion annually—is under review because of E1 construction, a development that would earn Netanyahu brickbats from across the political spectrum.
 
Such a decision would ignite a firestorm in America, but it might be the only way to rescue the Israeli left and win the peace. Plus, Obama’s already been re-elected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael J. Sandel’s “Justice,” Harvard’s mass-attended introduction to philosophy and moral reasoning for undergraduates, has continued to push the boundaries of traditional education this semester by bringing students from around the world into his lectures. On one recent Friday morning, students from Sao Paolo, Shanghai, New Delhi, and Tokyo joined Harvard students via Spin, a technology from startup Net Power & Light, to take part in Sandel’s famous participatory lectures. The inclusion of this technology in the classroom brings to the fore two seminal questions. The first concerns the use of technology in the classroom: As digital technologies become increasingly enmeshed with our lives, they prompt changes in education that outpace other developments in teaching. The question, therefore, is what marks an appropriate level of technology and social media use for a college lecture? The second asks whether the use of internet phone calls is in fact symptomatic of a drop in teaching standards that has gone too far.
While using Spin in a lecture of roughly 400 students might give the appearance of such a decline, we should avoid applying one definition of rigor to judge all classes at a single institution. No one standard exists for defining what makes a good class at a top undergraduate institution like Harvard College. Justice is well known for its inclusion of students’ opinions and for pioneering the filming and freely accessible digitization of each of Sandel’s lectures. Accessibility, both to education and to different sources of knowledge, implicitly sits at the core of Justice’s mission. For this reason, Sandel’s decision to include student opinions from across the world in Harvard’s Sanders Theater does not appear inconsistent with the goals of his class. The clear challenge is therefore to optimize the use of Spin, and any technology, so that it contributes to enhanced student engagement with the core material of Justice.
No two classes are the same, and Justice in particular follows a very different model from most Harvard classes. As a result, some aspects of teaching standards vary too. In Math 55, or in a literature seminar, it is easy to see why the addition of social or digital media would seem a distraction from the intellectual consistency of the course. But for Justice, a different set of concerns exist. Since this course has sought, for better or worse, to subvert the norms of a lecture by emphasizing learning from peers alongside and simultaneous to learning from a professor, an effort to create as diverse a pool of peers as possible seems worth the disruptive risk. As Sandel commented to The Crimson, “It was exciting to see students wrestle with these hard ethical questions across national and cultural boundaries… It offers us a glimpse of what a global public discourse might be.”
Fundamentally, Justice’s experience of technology in the classroom demonstrates the potential of innovative methods of sharing ideas and information, but cautions us to the challenge and hence preparation needed to integrate new media into the classroom and produce positive effects. As experience accrues over time of using digital technology carefully, a “global public discourse” might become less of a gimmick and more a sustainable method of learning.
 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
 CORRECTION: Dec. 26

 
An earlier version of this article erroneously claimed that Michael J. Sandel used Skype to connect students from around the world in his lectures. In fact, the technology used was Spin by San Francisco-based startup Net Power & Light.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard President Drew G. Faust stated that the Harvard Corporation was actively considering the creation of a social choice fund within the endowment. She wrote in her statement, “The desire to see a social choice fund at Harvard is a topic that began coming up with increasing frequency in my conversations with students and alumni last spring, and it led me to suggest to the Corporation that we explore the possibility of creating such a fund.” This is a positive development indeed, demonstrating that the University will not ignore the statement made by the almost 3,000 undergraduates who supported the third Undergraduate Council referendum this year and the 450 students and alumni who have donated to the Fair Harvard Fund. While this is an important step forward, it is certainly not a victory: We still have far to go to achieve our end goal of creating a social choice fund within Harvard’s endowment. The Harvard community must pay close attention to the details of such a fund to ensure its maximal effectiveness.
This positive signal from the administration is not one to be treated lightly. Rarely do any considerations of the Corporation reach the public without predicting future action. But there is still much work to be done toward the realization of this social choice fund.  First, members of the Harvard community must ensure that this “consideration” becomes a concrete reality. The creation of such a fund now seems much more likely after Faust’s statement, but nothing is assured until its final creation. We cannot and should not be placated by this public statement of consideration and must continue to pressure the administration toward concrete action.
Furthermore, the Corporation has several important decisions to make regarding the details of such a fund. Its establishment would be a pivotal moment in the history of Harvard’s endowment. As members of the Harvard community, we need to actively engage in the creation process to ensure the fund’s maximal success. Important decisions regarding its management and degree of publicity will greatly affect its ability to realize its goals. As such, the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition advocates that the university consider accountability, transparency, and broad reach in any social choice fund it creates.
First, Harvard must create a committee of students, alumni, faculty, and workers who are empowered to oversee the social choice fund manager hiring and review processes. One of the core goals of responsible investment is accountability. The institution of such a committee would ensure that the fund is maintained according to environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria.
Second, Harvard must also actively publicize the fund. Harvard should ask donors whether they want to give to the social choice fund in every fundraising appeal that endowment gifts are solicited, whether written, digital, or by phone. The fund will only be successful if people donate it to it, and it is only through active publicization of the fund that such donations will occur.
Third, Harvard must manage its social choice fund in-house. The Corporation needs to demonstrate an internal commitment to the ideals of responsible investment. We cannot ask someone else to be moral for us.
Fourth, Harvard should publicly disclose the fund’s investments on a 12-month time delay.  Transparency is a central tenet of responsible investment. As such, public disclosure must be part of the fund’s implementation. We certainly understand that the immediate disclosure of investments may be perceived as damaging to the fund’s financial success and therefore advocate for a 12-month time delay.
Fifth, Harvard must accept donations of any size to the fund. The establishment of a social choice fund is premised on the idea that money matters, that investments can and are statements. Donating to the social choice fund should never be cost-prohibitive.
Finally, Harvard must use the social choice fund to make new investments instead of co-opting previous commitments. The establishment of this fund is a sign of change in the endowment. Labeling current holdings as those of the social choice fund is the maintenance of the status quo and does nothing to promote greater invest responsibility.
A social choice fund created along these guidelines is one that is well-equipped to work for positive change in the endowment. The donations currently being held in escrow in the Fair Harvard Fund would be transferred to the University to serve as the foundation for such a social choice fund. Ultimately, we hope that the University will apply responsible investment principles to the endowment as a whole. The creation of a social choice fund should be merely the first step toward an endowment invested transparently and responsibly according to environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John E. Ferguson, a 64-year-old Florida death-row inmate, has been sleeping at death’s door for almost three decades. Earlier in his life, he brutally murdered at least eight innocent people, including a teenage girl whom he raped before fatally shooting her. According to Florida state law, Ferguson’s maniacal crimes call for the highest form of punishment: the death sentence. But no matter how heinous his crimes, they must be viewed in light of his mental illness. Ferguson believes he is “the Prince of God.”
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to extend the death penalty to a defendant lacking the “ability to comprehend the nature of the penalty.” A 2007 amendment to this ruling added clarity, stating that a “prisoner’s awareness of the state’s rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it.” Yet according to Florida law, the defendant need not understand the reason as to why the death penalty is being applied, but merely be aware of its connection to his crimes. If Ferguson is indeed executed, it will lead to crippling effects on the credibility of the American justice system and open up doors for further unjust persecutions.
On October 23, Ferguson’s last meal was being prepared as his lawyers made three frantic attempts to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking stays of execution. All three were denied that day. In a final attempt, a new appeal filed at the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta led to the granting of a stay of execution. As Ferguson awaits the court’s verdict, it is important to note the enormous moral implications of this case should the execution proceed as planned. The execution of a paranoid schizophrenic would set a dangerous precedent for killing of criminals who lack sanity.
Symptoms of Ferguson’s mental illness can be traced back to 1965, when he experienced visual hallucinations. The 1970s saw him in and out of mental hospitals for both severe psychosis and schizophrenia. He also claims to hear the voice of his dead father and is paranoid that people are constantly watching him and listening to him. At one point, he even claimed that cockroaches were crawling in his brain.
David A. Glant, the judge presiding over the case, stated that with "reasonable medical certainty…Mr. Ferguson has no genuine current mental illness and understands the nature and effect of the death penalty and why it was imposed on him.” His statement is based on a report generated by state-appointed psychiatrists, ruling out a forty-year history of mental illness while simultaneously admitting that the psychiatrists "did not complete a thorough and exhaustive interview of Ferguson at Florida state prison."
The American legal system should not allow room for such partial and superficial examinations of a defendant’s mental health. If justice is to be preserved, then honesty and validity must be upheld. It is not enough that Glant believes Ferguson to be sane with “reasonable” medical certainty. It does not permit the execution of a delusional man. Laurel G. Bellows, the president of the American Bar Association, supported the need for a reassessment of the case in order to uphold such rights when she released a statement expressing her concern: "The American Bar Association is alarmed that Florida is poised to execute John Ferguson, a man diagnosed as severely mentally ill for more than forty years, before the constitutionality of his execution is fully evaluated."
Executing an insane man would raise a question regarding the nature of morality: Are we to hold a person who lacks the mental faculty of reason responsible for any crimes committed as a result of his irrationality? When laws are created, an assumption is made that a person has the ability to differentiate between right and wrong, to choose to follow a law or to knowingly break it. Ferguson clearly does not possess the right mental capacities to form such a decision and so cannot be held as morally responsible for his actions.
Treating Ferguson as legally insane would not excuse his crimes. Ferguson should receive a sentence that takes into account both his crimes and his mental health. If not, the Ferguson case will bear severe repercussions that will affect our conceptions of morality and criminal justice. As Ben Lewis, one of his defense lawyers, explains, “This is a guy with long-standing mental health issues that stretch over four decades, with 30 different doctors having diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic, including Florida state and court-appointed doctors,” yet the question remains, “is [he] sane enough to be executed?"

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Emmy and Tony Award-winning television and stage star Kristin Chenoweth delighted students with frank analysis of her life and career at a talk Friday afternoon in Farkas Hall.
Best known for her roles as Glinda in the Broadway musical “Wicked” and, as Chenoweth described the role, “drunken has-been” April Rhodes on TV’s “Glee,” the actor fielded questions from students by offering funny anecdotes and candid advice. She was also surprised with a personal a cappella serenade from The Harvard Din & Tonics.
The talk, part of the “Learning from Performers” series, was sponsored by the Office for the Arts, the Harvard Foundation, and Faculty of Arts And Sciences Diversity Relations office.
“I can’t believe I’m here,” Chenoweth said. “This is a dream come true.”
Chenoweth reminisced with the audience about one of her childhood disappointments—not getting the coveted role of a mouse in a ballet recital.
“I didn’t fit in the mouse costume—I fit in the rabbit costume. The rabbit didn’t dance. I was devastated when I got that part,” Chenoweth said.
At one point in the show, a vine that some of the dancers had been carrying dropped onto the stage floor. Chenoweth sprung into action to make sure no one would trip.
“I thought, ‘What would a bunny do?’ So I hopped out, put it in my mouth, and hopped back. The place went ballistic.”
Chenoweth said the experience was a valuable lesson in looking past disappointment. “What I had originally thought I’d be doing didn’t work out that way. [What actually happened] was a lot better.”
Chenoweth shared with the audience some of the challenges she has faced during her adult career as well. Her 4’11’’ frame has rarely posed a big issue; she said: She just never wears flats. Other obstacles, such as overcoming the negative attitude toward performing arts in her Oklahoma high school, were harder for her to deal with.
“Saying being in the glee club was not cool is an understatement,” Chenoweth said.
Audience members enthusiastically applauded Chenoweth when she mentioned her successes.
Trevor N. Coyle ’14 said, “It was amazing to see her answer questions with such a beautiful sense of warmth. The fact that she talked openly about her struggles and imperfections was so inspirational. I felt connected to her.”
Chenoweth left the audience with words of wisdom about facing rejection in the entertainment industry.
“I call my friends up and dissect it to death. And then I move on,” Chenoweth said, “Rejection is a part of my business and a part of life. Let yourself go get a Frosty. Spend the day being pissed and then move the fuck on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending 10 minutes at a welcome party for newly elected Undergraduate Council representatives two years ago, Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 quickly realized that she was the only female freshman in the room.
But Zhu said she never allowed herself to become intimidated by that fact, even in a year when there was also only one woman among the UC’s roughly half-dozen committee chairs.
“One time, I was just asserting my opinion on an issue and a male representative made a comment about how I ‘acted just like a man’ and could be treated like ‘one of the guys.’ I was like, ‘That’s fine—treat me like one of you!’” recalled Zhu.
On Sunday, Zhu was inaugurated as the new UC vice president alongside her running mate, new UC president Tara Raghuveer ’14. Their victory last month marked just the third time an all-female ticket and the sixth time a female president took the top spot since UC elections began in 1995.
Observers say they are hopeful that Raghuveer and Zhu’s election, which comes in the midst of a UC campaign to increase gender parity within its own ranks, marks a step in the right direction for gender equality on campus.
But recent history suggests that men still disproportionately serve at the helm of many of Harvard’s most prominent student organizations. The Harvard College Democrats have only been led by two female presidents for the past nine years. The past five presidents of the Harvard Republican Club have all been male. Of the past 18 guards of The Harvard Crimson, only three have been led by female presidents.
On the other hand, some student organizations have seen more female leaders than male ones. Five of the past six Institute of Politics elections have been won by female candidates. Of the past seven presidents of Phillips Brooks House Association, only two have been male.
Outgoing UC vice president Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 said that in conducting collaborative research with the Harvard College Women’s Center, she found evidence that these trends extend across campus. Typically, she said, men lean toward academic clubs, pre-professional groups, media organizations, and publications, while women gravitate toward public service and health and wellness groups.
To address gender imbalance on the UC, Yalamanchi and outgoing UC president Danny P. Bicknell ’13 launched an initiative this fall to persuade more women to run for UC office.
Following this fall’s elections, the Council’s body of representatives is now 43 percent female, an upswing from 25 percent two years ago.
Yalamanchi said that although her  campaign is currently an internal UC intiative, she hopes other student organizations across campus will launch similar initiatives to seek out untapped student talent.
“Harvard definitely selects students for their leadership potential, so we do have a talented group of equally matched leaders on campus,” Yalamanchi said.
While Yalamanchi acknowledged that many student organizations whose top positions are typically filled by men often have a large number of lower-ranking female officers, she said that this is not enough.
“While all board positions are important, there is a difference between vision and implementation and it is based on the leadership position you hold,” she said.
Leaders, she added, are in a unique position to “define the vision of the group and the group’s direction for the future.”
As Raghuveer prepares for her term as UC president, she said she will continue her predecessors’ campaign to increase the visibility of women on campus.
However, while she agrees that more female leaders will make the Harvard community “more vibrant,” she said she does not want to be remembered purely as a female leader.
Instead, she said her efforts will be directed toward encouraging students of all genders to run for office.
“It’s important not to promote female leadership over male leadership,” Raghuveer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part I of a three-part series on mental health at Harvard. Part II was published on Dec. 12, and Part III on Dec. 14.
“I felt that it was better to take my life than to accept failure,” Christine says plainly.
Christine, now a senior, is direct and open as she reflects on her first of two suicide attempts during her sophomore year. Shaking her head, she says that she thought college would allow her to escape the depression and anxiety that plagued her in high school.
“I came to Harvard thinking Harvard would fix it,” she reflects wryly. “I thought, ‘I can build my own life from scratch and build something wonderful.’”
But during her second year of college, news from home triggered overwhelming emotions.
Over a phone call in early December, Christine learned that one of her close family members was found homeless on the streets. That news flooded her mind with memories and emotions from her own experience at home.
“The only way I felt I could respond and make a statement was to commit suicide,” she says. “The ultimate statement of rebellion and expression of pain was to hurt myself.”
Christine became calculating and rational as she prepared for death. She withdrew all of the money from her bank account and placed it in an envelope for her roommate.
“I figured I should probably utilize my resources effectively,” she says. “At least if I die someone could use my money.”
However, when Christine made it back to her dorm room, she became emotionally overwhelmed. Channeling her anger and pain toward her possessions, she pitched objects across the room. A suitemate who happened to be in at the time heard the shattering of glass and called 9-1-1.
“I was numb; it was surreal,” Christine says. “I felt like an 80-year-old woman. I felt I had experienced way too many things to fit into my 20-year-old body.”
Though her memories from the attempt are hazy, she laughs now when she recalls the ambulance driver asking her if she would like the siren on. Christine—whose name has been changed, like the other students in this series, all of whom have attempted suicide—attributes her mental illness to her abusive home. However, like nearly every student interviewed for this series, she also faults Harvard’s health system and high-pressure culture with contributing to mental illness.
SAD NEWS
The email, titled “Sad News,” has been sent out three times so far this year. Each time it opens with a similar line: “It is with very great sorrow that I write to inform you of the death of a member of the Harvard College community.”
Though the names, biographies, and location of death differ in each of the emails, Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds’ message remains the same.
By the third “Sad News” email of 2012, Christine began to wonder how an achievement-driven environment like Harvard might aggravate mental illness—and, for some, ultimately lead to suicide. One of those emails stated that the student had taken his own life; within days of another, The Boston Globe and other media reported that the death was a suicide.
Paul J. Barreira, then the director of behavioral health and academic counseling for University Health Services, told The Crimson in October 2011 that the suicide rate among Harvard students was fewer than 5 per year for 100,000 students.
That rate would place Harvard well below the national average of 12 per 100,000, last reported by the Center for Disease Control in 2009, and below the average for college students, listed at 6.18 per 100,000 in a 2009-10 nationwide study conducted by a University of Virginia researcher.
Harvard’s relatively low rate, which was calculated before this year’s three deaths, counted enrolled students over a 10-year time frame at all of the University’s schools, according to University Health Services spokesperson Lindsey Baker, and excluded students on leave, following the convention of other universities nationwide.
Using a 5-year time frame focused solely on the undergraduate population, The Crimson found a significantly higher suicide rate.
Counting only enrolled undergraduates who committed suicide either on or off campus, the College’s suicide rate is 18.18 per 100,000. When students who committed suicide while taking a leave of absence are included, that rate increases to 24.24 per 100,000.
Even the most conservative calculation, made using only enrolled college students who committed suicide on campus, yields a rate of 12.12 per 100,000—over twice the rate provided by UHS last year, and nearly twice the national average for college students.
Whether examining the numbers or listening to individual survivors’ stories, the problem is painfully evident. This three-part series tracks the ways struggling students say University Health Services could serve them better, the efforts of a few University officials and student activists to change the numbers, and the difficult paths that mentally ill students currently navigate once they enter Harvard Yard.
DONNING THE MASK
Martin has attempted suicide twice while a student at Harvard.
“We put on a mask,” he says. “We put on a perfect face that just isn’t us. All of us are struggling and flawed in some way, but by putting on the mask we all end up magnifying the individual insecurities of the students who are here.”
Martin worries that a lack of open discourse makes it difficult for individuals to express their need for mental health care. Mental illness is stigmatized at Harvard, he says, and the seemingly successful student body is a large part of the problem.
“You come back from summer break, and everyone tells about their amazing summer. They tell perfect, unflawed stories. You begin feeling that everything we do is supposed to be successful; everyone is supposed to be so happy. It leads to a culture that amplifies feelings of inadequacy,” he says.
Christine came to Harvard thinking friends, leadership positions, and academic performance would liberate her mind from the past, but she soon found herself crying every day of her freshman year. She resisted the urge to tell someone about her depression because she thought she was the only one struggling.
“I came here and everyone was a National [Merit] Scholar; everyone was really smart,” she says. “It didn’t feel like any of the things I had accomplished in the past twenty years mattered because everyone had it—and more.”
DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS
For thirty years, Kyle M. Carney ’73, a licensed independent clinical social worker, has worked with Harvard students at the Mount Auburn Counseling Center in Harvard Square.
Harvard students do not suffer from mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder at a rate higher than the general population, according to Carney, but a “high prevalence” of anxiety and depression is linked to achievement.
“All of a sudden when they arrive at Harvard, they are no longer ‘a big fish in a small pond’ and it can be very stressful and difficult to cope. That, combined with moving away from home, sometimes halfway across the country, leaving friends and family, can be quite difficult,” says Carney.
Undergraduates are not alone. Carney notes that many of the stresses facing Harvard College students—including adjustment to the competitive atmosphere and anxiety about their next steps after Harvard—are amplified among the many post-docs and tenure-track professors who also seek treatment at the center, which is not affiliated with the University.
According to a year-end survey conducted by UHS last spring, one quarter of Harvard College students reported symptoms of anxiety and 18.7 percent reported symptoms of depression. Three and a half percent of College students admitted to having suicidal thoughts.
“Environments in which students can perform at very high levels academically while also engaging in a broad array of time-consuming extra-curricular pursuits can result in unnecessary stress,” a UHS statement says as a reflection on the numbers. “This is a phenomenon occurring throughout higher education, and Harvard is no exception.”
BATTLE WOUNDS
Mackenzie attempted suicide at home after a difficult sophomore year. Having done well academically in high school, she felt that people would not take her seriously when she said she was having trouble with tests and work at Harvard.
“I was forced to live a lie,” she says. “I was hiding my struggle. I felt that if I can’t finish something, I’m a bad student. I’m a bad person.”
Though she made close friends and enjoyed the fact that freshman year allowed her to explore, Mackenzie’s feelings toward Harvard changed as her academic struggles intensified.
“It got more difficult to answer if you enjoy your time at Harvard,” says the current senior, who took time off after her suicide attempt.
Alexa, who has also attempted suicide and who suffers from bipolar disorder—mostly depressive, which she jokes is “less fun”—feels that it is not Harvard itself that brings out mental illness.
“People like us are often intelligent and creative and also prone to mental illness. If you get thousands of us together, it’s likely that there are going to be issues,” she says. “My friends are all crazy in different ways.”
A fan of the University’s mental health offerings, Alexa is grateful for the medical help she has received. However, she worries that a culture of perfection has for many students made reaching out for help tantamount to surrender.
“The likelihood is that every other person you’re sitting next to is dealing with some of the same issues you are,” she says quietly. “But people don’t necessarily know that or talk about it. There is a culture of keeping going, wearing your battle wounds.”

As warm winter coats and gloves have found their way back into Harvard Square, so have student favorites like Korean barbecue found their way back into Harvard’s dining halls. These established winter classics will be joined this year by new items including a Greek pita station.
In past years, the winter menu has started after winter break, but in response to student feedback, Harvard University Dining Services launched its winter menu this year on Nov. 28.
Many students said that they are excited about the return of the winter menu.
“I’m always disappointed when Korean barbecue is only in the winter because I think it’s something HUDS does really well,” Sean T. Walsh ’14 said.
In addition to Korean food on Tuesdays, HUDS will once again feature a variety of international cuisines on Friday nights, including dishes from India, Italy, and China.
Kamil S. Chima ’15, who already experience his first taste of HUDS’ winter Chinese food, praised the new winter menu items.
“The Chinese food was really good. I didn’t know it was part of the new menu,” Chima said. “The steak—fantastic.”
The addition of Greek food comes after chef Diane Kochilas visited in October, giving students a taste of Greek items and leaving her recipes behind for HUDS to use.
According to HUDS’ blog, Kochilas will return in the spring for a visit that will be accompanied by a special Greek-themed dinner.
In response to student feedback, some of the new menu items include beef, cheesecake, grilled salmon, Indian food, macaroni and cheese, lasagna, pot stickers, tortellini, and ravioli.
Keith W. Grubb ’13 praised the diversity of the new options.
“I think HUDS is doing a good job trying to vary its menu,” Grubb said.
Walsh said that he thinks the HUDS changes were effective in sparking excitement among students. “When there are changes that are good, I notice,” he said. “There’s something to look forward to.”
While excited about the new menu, other students still have suggestions.
“Chinese food night was great. It seems like a nice idea,” John Y. C. Wang ’16 said, adding that “plenty of people say that HUDS should bring in more berries.”
According to the HUDS blog, other suggestions from students might appear on the spring menu. These suggestions include make-your-own gyros, asparagus, enchiladas, healthier brain break options, and a Brazilian barbeque.

Hundreds of students, faculty, staff, and other members of the Cambridge community flocked to the Science Center on Friday to drop off their unwanted items in exchange for the latest finds at Harvard’s FreeCycle.
The free give-and-take event, hosted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Green Program and the Facilities Maintenance Operations Recycling & Solid Waste Removal group, is held every three to four months on campus.
“They’re our way of making sure that good items don’t go to the trash,” said Brandon P. Geller, senior coordinator of the FAS Green Program.
The tables of the Science Center were filled with roughly 500 pounds of items ranging from office supplies like staplers and old typewriters to household items such as lamps and kiddie pools. One table was devoted exclusively to the display of over 100 binders.
Shoppers, including a HUPD officer who walked away with a large metal filing cabinet, eagerly filled their pockets, bags, or arms with anything they desired.
“This is the first year I had to put up signs that said ‘Do not take before 11,’” Geller said.
Shoppers also encountered less commonplace artifacts such as an antique pea-green Samsonite suitcase and a Bounty Hunter Princess Leia action figure from 1996. Christopher D. Liedl, a proctor in Matthews Hall, brought in a half-full bag of topsoil passed down from the proctor before him.
“It was either that or bring it to a white elephant gift exchange,” Leidl said.
Some attendees had unconventional plans for their finds. One said he hoped to fashion percussion instruments for children out of the dozens of plastic Easter eggs he found at the event.
According to Robert Gogan, a Facilities Maintenance Operations associate manager, the most desired items at FreeCycles are overproduced Harvard gear or items bearing the Harvard insignia without license. At previous FreeCyles, shoppers have claimed “Hardvard” sweatpants made overseas and mass-produced key card holders from the Freshman Dean’s Office.
The excitement was felt by those giving in addition to those receiving.
Physics department Building and Facilities Manager Stuart W. McNeil grinned as he tossed neon-yellow safety vests to a crowd of eager attendees.
Unclaimed items will be taken to the Surplus Distribution in Allston, a giveaway event which occurs every Thursday.
“Look at the tables; it’s a blast,” Gogan said. “What’s better than stuff for free?”

After stripping away decades’ worth of old paint, the renovators of Old Quincy uncovered the original color of the window frames: “useful gray,” model no. 7050. That shade—an off-white more muted than the bright white on today’s River Houses—now rims all the windows on the Neo-Georgian brick building, just one step in a restoration that seeks to modernize Old Quincy’s interior while remaining true to the building’s 82-year history.
Students can expect better living accommodations and more accessible common spaces inside the building, project managers said during a building tour on Friday. The new design dramatically redraws the floor plan of Old Quincy, which once lacked elevators and subjected students to walk-through bedrooms. New rooms will include a mix of singles, doubles, and four- to six-person suites, and unlike old rooms, insulation will make them mostly sound-proof. Each floor will contain male and female communal bathrooms, with an additional gender-neutral single bathroom. Future residents will also have access to two elevators.
Building designers also incorporated common spaces into each entryway—now two to a floor, rather than one to a staircase—that include printers for each floor and seating areas built into hallway nooks.
Like the common spaces developed in the renovation of Yale’s Colleges—a similar major project which senior project manager Lee Blackwell, who is now running the Quincy renewal, worked on for about 15 years—Old Qunicy will feature new recreational spaces in addition to residential rooms.
An expansive basement multi-purpose room with windows and high ceilings opens onto an outdoor terrace, with a grassy ramp up to the ground level of Quincy courtyard.
The basement will also house a “smart” classroom equipped with video technology for long-distance student interactions, music rooms with digital recording devices, and a rehearsal room that lets musicians practice with remote music groups.
Project managers said that they considered installing air-conditioning but realized that current Massachusetts weather would only necessitate its use for a few days each school year. Instead, student rooms will be equipped with new ceiling fans, and during the winter, students will have access to a thermostat that offers limited control of room temperature. Space has also been left in the walls for the wiring and pipes required for air-conditioning units in case climate change makes them a necessity.
Each room will be outfitted with new furniture, including one possible desk with built-in electrical outlets.
Project managers said that they prioritized the historical preservation of Old Quincy, which—along with the rest of the River Houses and a number of other Harvard buildings—is on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to rediscovering the original paint color, builders sought to use authentic materials in the construction, in one case converting old doors into wood paneling and flooring. The slate roof, which had deteriorated since the building’s construction in 1930, was replaced with shingles from the same quarry in Vermont. Several unsound chimneys were taken down and carefully reconstructed in their original style—of the fifteen chimneys now standing, it is nearly impossible to tell which six are replicas and which are the refurbished originals.
Sustainable design has also been an important consideration throughout the construction process, and project managers said that they hoped to improve the heat efficiency of Old Quincy by insulating its brick walls and chimneys and installing air-tight, double-paned windows instead of storm windows. Additionally, a rain-water accumulation tank will reduce water waste by recycling rain for non-potable uses like toilet flushing.
Although they said that the building was structurally sound, builders faced several challenges common to historical renovations. Designers found it difficult to modernize the floor plan of Old Quincy, which is only 35 feet wide from one exterior wall to the other. Modern architectural wisdom calls for a 65-foot width for a typical college dorm, managers said. Additionally, trained workers had to remove toxic asbestos from some parts of the building. Renovators water-proofed the basement and built pumps to remove groundwater—a constant concern for most of Harvard’s buildings close to the Charles River.
Since construction began in June, the workers—usually 80 to 110 a day—have mostly finished work on the interior façade and will soon tackle the Plympton Street side. The old walls inside have been entirely gutted and  replaced by a five-story steel skeleton of the House-to-be lit by construction lamps and soon to benefit from temporary heating.
Old Quincy is set to open in August, just after renovation of Leverett—the next House to undergo renewal—begins in June.

With their right hands resting on an iPad displaying the Undergraduate Council constitution, Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 were sworn in as UC president and vice president at Sunday night’s general meeting.
After taking the oath of office, the duo expressed their gratitude to outgoing President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13.
“Danny and Pratyusha built a lot of amazing relationships with the administration this year,” Raghuveer said. “They also really expanded the student voice, as evidenced by this year’s referenda.”
Zhu echoed Raghuveer’s statement of gratitude.
“You don’t know how much time they’ve put in behind the scenes,” Zhu said. “Tara and I are going to try so hard to fill those shoes.”
Also at Sunday’s meeting, the UC passed three policy papers affirming the Council’s support of the three student-led referenda.
The referenda—calling for Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies, to change its sexual assault policies by adopting affirmative consent, and to create a fund dedicated to responsible investment—passed in November with robust student support.
Before passing the divestment and social choice fund policy papers, representatives debated whether the amendment questions students voted on in the election were written with biased phrasing.
“I think everything is biased,” said Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14, who argued that there was no way for the Council to judge the extent to which questions exhibit partial wording.
Ultimately, the UC added wording to the legislation that recognized biased phrasing in the referenda questions.
UC representatives approved the creation of three task forces, assigned to each referendum. The groups, consisting of members appointed by the UC president, will listen to student opinion, report back to the Council, and work toward enacting the results of the referenda.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, the UC passed a final fall grants pack, approved funding for Cabot Cafe and Quincy Grill giveaways, voiced their support for the addition of American Sign Language courses, and voted to disband a sub-committee on publicity.

Georgetown University is the latest institution to join edX—an online education venture started by Harvard and MIT—Georgetown President John J. Degioia announced yesterday.
Georgetown’s participation in edX is part of the university’s broader $8 million investment in “technology-enhanced learning,” according to information from the school’s website.
Georgetown officials and faculty members plan to utilize the edX platform both to provide online courses and better understand how technology can enhance learning, according to the university’s press release. They also hope to craft new approaches toward teaching on campus in Washington, D. C. and at Georgetown’s international campus in Doha, Qatar.
First announced last May, the edX initiative aims to make knowledge more accessible to the public by providing online versions of courses from participating universities. The not-for-profit endeavor, first launched with $30 million investments from both Harvard and MIT, currently allows anyone with access to a computer to enroll in an edX course—of which nine have been offered so far—at no charge. The educational enterprise has already attracted hundreds of thousands of students from around the world.
GeorgetownX, the subsection of online courses offered by Georgetown, will be launched in the fall of 2013. The school is now part of a cadre of educational institutions that, in addition to Harvard and MIT, includes the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Texas school system, and, most recently, Wellesley College.

UPDATED: Dec. 10, 2012, at 9:38 p.m.
Songs ranging from a Chinese tune that depicts the seven states of being drunk to a rendition of an instrumental piece in the French film “Amelie” filled Dudley House dining hall Sunday night during the World Music Ensemble’s fall concert.
Directed by ethnomusicology student Rujing “Stacy” Huang, the ensemble features twelve students from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, MIT, and the greater Boston area.
Formed in 2002, the ensemble was created to provide a venue for graduate school musicians to play and experiment with international music. Directors, who serves two-year terms, make sure the ensemble’s repertoire reflects a wide variety of cultural influences.
Huang selected Chinese music for Sunday’s concert.
“After I joined, I realized how much I didn’t know [about music],” Huang said. “For me, it’s personally a great pleasure to learn different music. It’s this kind of experimental spirit I really like.”
The group itself is as diverse as its music. Qihan Liu, a third year graduate student in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, whistles for the ensemble.
Since joining, Brad D. Nelms, a cell biology student at GSAS, has played 10 different instruments.
“I like this group because it’s very informal,” Nelms said, who played guitar and fiddle for Sunday’s concert.
Ovul Sezer ’10, a first year student at GSAS and HBS, played the Kanun, a harp-like string instrument.
“I was really surprised and impressed with the welcoming atmosphere and the improv nature,” Sezer said. “Everyone suggests something, and we work together.”
In addition to the World Music Ensemble, Dudley House, the communal home for thousands of GSAS students is a haven for three other active music ensembles: the Jazz Combo/Big Band, Orchestra, and Dudley Chorus.
Although the separate departments can tend to stay within their own fields, the ensembles give graduate students from across the University a chance to perform together, according to African-American music professor Ingrid Monson.
“I really do think performing music is a community experience, so I’m very grateful for Dudley House support,” Monson said.
Susan Zawalich, the Dudley House administrator, agreed to the community aspect of the ensembles.
“They give wonderful performances. All these students always tell me how much it means for them to be in the groups,” she said.
Aaron T. Kuan ’09, a GSAS student, emphasized that the Dudley House ensembles serve as opportunities for students to spend time away from studies and professional life.
“By the time people are in grad school here, they really understand that they love playing music. It really helps people unwind,” Kuan said.

UPDATED: December 10, 2012, at 5:29 p.m.
New gathering spaces intended to alleviate cramped conditions in the dining hall proper will be built as part of next year’s renovation of Old Leverett, according to design plans released Monday by Harvard administrators.
When construction begins in June 2013, McKinlock Hall will become the second dorm to undergo renovations as part of the University’s House renewal program. The building’s interior will be entirely redesigned in the more-than-yearlong renovation process, while its traditional Neo-Georgian exterior will be kept intact.
Although the Leverett dining hall will reopen in time for the return of students in fall 2013, construction on the rest of the building will continue through fall 2014.
Like the plans for Old Quincy, which is currently being renovated, those for Old Leverett call for the elimination of walk-through bedrooms in favor of clusters of rooms and singles off of hallways. Old Leverett will also see the addition of common spaces and new horizontal hallways that connect the traditional vertical entryways.
While administrators say that these features will likely be included in the plans for the other undergraduate Houses, they will have to address problems specific to each House. In Leverett, for instance, the dining hall often becomes overcrowded during peak meal times.
Construction plans seek to combat crowding in the dining hall by adding additional common spaces, though the square footage of the current dining hall will remain the same.
The alleyway that students currently use to access the dining hall from Memorial Drive will be walled off and covered by a glass roof, creating what is called a light court in plans. This passage will attach the dining hall to a newly built lounge and classroom space.
Additionally, a new underground passageway will connect the wing of the building that includes the dining hall with the rest of the dorm. This corridor, which is intended to be used as a gallery for student artwork, will be lit by a skylight.
“Spaces like this are opportunities for us,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said.
The existing art and music studios in the basement of McKinlock will also be renovated. All undergraduates will also be able to access a recreation room, which will function as a theater space including new lights, a sound system, and a stage.
A combination of ramps and two elevators will make the renovated building accessible to students in wheelchairs. The building is also aiming to be LEED Gold certified as part of an effort to make the renewed Houses more environmentally friendly.
The approximately 175 students displaced by the renovation of Old Leverett in the 2013-2014 academic year will be housed in the three Harvard-owned apartment buildings—Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton St., Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Avenue, and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn St.—currently being used as swing space for Quincy students.
Construction on Old Quincy and Old Leverett, deemed “test projects” by administrators and architects, will inform the plans for the renovation of full Houses.
Old Leverett is the first dorm with a dining hall, House Masters’ residence, and House common spaces to be renovated.
Beginning in 2015, Dunster House will be the first full House to be renovated in the project. Dunster students will be housed in the Inn at Harvard while construction takes place. Administrators plan to eventually modernize all 12 undergraduate Houses.

Members of the the Harvard track and field team shook off the offseason rust on Saturday at the Harvard Open, posting solid showings at the Crimson’s indoor opener.
Although Harvard only sent a portion of its team to the meet, the individual results placed the team at a good position to begin the season, according to co-captain Sydnie Leroy.
“I think that we have really big goals this season, and this was exactly where we need to be for those goals to be realistic,” Leroy said.
Held at Gordon Indoor Track, the meet pitted Harvard against a variety of teams, including local competitors Holy Cross, Northeastern, and Ivy rival Dartmouth. Although the competition was not the toughest the Crimson will face this season, senior pole vaulter Nico Weiler says it provided competitors a chance to gauge themselves early on.
“It was really good, considering it was really, really, really early in the season,” Weiler said. “It’s really cool to see where the team stands. I think the meets will get more competitive as the season progresses, but I think that’s because everybody gets into better shape.”
Freshman Martina Salander, a multi-eventer, came out hot in her first collegiate meet, posting a time of 7.96 seconds in the 55-meter hurdles, 0.26 seconds ahead of teammate junior Olivia Abbate, to take first place. Salander also earned a victory in the 600-meter, finishing the race in 1:38.68, nearly four seconds faster than any other competitor. She also placed third in the shot put, with a mark of 13.06 meters, short of Sacred Heart’s Lindsay Aponte and  Dartmouth’s Emmaline Berg by 1.08 and 0.54 meters, respectively.
Another freshman who tasted victory in her first collegiate meet was Autumne Franklin, who edged out UMass Lowell’s Nicole Giaquinto in the 300-meter dash by 0.29 seconds with a time of 40.22 seconds. Franklin also came in third in the 55-meter hurdles, thwarted only by her Crimson teammates.
“Our incoming freshman class is dominating,” Leroy said. “We have a few freshmen multi-eventers, and it was their first time out, and they did really, really well—definitely exceeded our expectations. They scored a lot of points for us, which is exactly what we need them to do—they’re really coming along. I think they’re going to be huge players for us this year in the Ivy League.”
The sophomores performed well in the 55-meter dash, as Danielle Barbian tied for second, finishing the race in 7.17 seconds. Ashley Collinsworth was just 0.02 seconds behind Barbian, taking fourth. Collinsworth finished fourth in the 300-meter dash with a time of 41.06 seconds, and teammates Abbate and freshman Christi Scott took fifth and sixth place, respectively. Sophomore Ann Giebelhaus also experienced success, taking first in the high jump, topping out at 1.70 meters.
“[Giebelhaus] really had a great day,” Leroy said. “She came in with a huge jump for the first meet of the year.”
Leroy vaulted herself into first as well, tying with Northeastern’s Jillian Decarteret and Jacilyn Briggs at 3.45 meters. In the men’s pole vault, Weiler reached the top of the podium in after clearing 4.95 meters. Despite his first-place finish, Weiler was not entirely pleased with his performance.
“Personally, I’m not really happy with the height of my performance, but I am really happy with how I jumped,” Weiler said. “I’m happy with the pole and how I ran, and I’m happy with the shape I’m in. Usually I’m used to shifting up one gear when I’m jumping, but today I felt like I could shift up two because of the good preparation all offseason.”
Sophomore Jesaiah Coy raced to a second-place finish in the 300-meter dash at 35.74 seconds, just 0.17 seconds behind Rhode Island’s Zach Campo. Jarvis Harris, also a sophomore, posted a solid showing in the 55-meter hurdles, coming in third with a sub-7.70 time, 0.10 seconds after the first-place finisher, Rhode Island’s Wayne Seaton.
“The standard throughout the Ivy League in track and field has gotten to just incredible levels, so if we want to achieve our team goals, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “But it’s a talented, great group of student-athletes, so I’m excited for what we’re going to be able to accomplish this season.”

They say that sometimes the best things in life are the ones you have to wait for, but that wasn’t necessarily the case for the No. 20 Harvard men’s hockey team on Friday.
Playing its first game in 20 days, the Crimson could not hang on to an early two-goal lead and tied at Merrimack, 2-2, in North Andover, Mass.
All four goals were scored in the second period, during which time Harvard was outshot 16-9. But the Crimson (4-3-1, 3-3 ECAC) got on the board first when sophomore forward Tommy O’Regan and freshman defenseman Desmond Bergin registered scores in the period’s third minute.
At the 3:13 mark of the second, O’Regan put back a rebound in traffic for his first goal of the season, with Bergin and senior defenseman Brendan Rempel earning credit for assists.
Just 31 seconds later, O’Regan returned the favor by assisting Bergin, who fired a slapshot from the left circle past Merrimack goalie Sam Marotta to put Harvard up, 2-0.
Bergin’s goal gave O’Regan an assist in seven of his last eight games and was the first career score for the rookie from Natick, Mass.
“It’s always exciting to get your first college goal, and for it to come in an important game at Merrimack, it had to be a good feeling for him,” junior defenseman Dan Ford said.
But the Warriors (5-7-3, 4-4-1 Hockey East) answered right back within three minutes when Rhett Bly scored a short-handed goal, and at the 13:58 mark of the period, Merrimack’s Mike Collins beat Harvard junior goalie Raphael Girard to tie things up.
Neither team was able to get on the board from there, as the Warriors outshot the Crimson 12-7 the rest of the way and 38-24 on the night.
“It’s hard to keep your feet wet if you haven’t been playing for a couple weeks, but I think we did a good job playing the whole game,” Girard said. “It was a really great effort for the whole team.”
POWER OUTAGE
The Crimson was plagued by penalties throughout the night, registering 19 minutes in the box on eight infractions. Merrimack, in contrast, was called for just four penalties totaling eight minutes.
Harvard endured the game’s first four penalties and its final three. Captain Danny Biega was whistled for interference at the 7:59 mark of the opening period and for boarding at 13:50, and later the defenseman was called for kneeing on the final play of regulation.
“I don’t like to complain about the refs, but they had some doubtful calls,” Girard said. “But you have to live with the decisions the ref makes and you have to go with it whether you’re happy or not because you still have to kill the penalty.”
Harvard did just that Friday night, holding Merrimack scoreless on all its man-up opportunities, including throughout the entire five-minute overtime thanks to Biega’s final infraction.
That success continued a recurring trend for Harvard, which has now denied its opponent on 29 of 31 man-up chances (94 percent), the fourth-best rate in the country.
“The penalty kill was really good,” Ford said. “[It] has been pretty good all year with guys blocking shots and competing really hard and getting clears, and that continued last night and really kept us in the game.”
MISSING IN ACTION
During its 19-day stretch between games, a handful of players were removed from Harvard’s official roster, which was smaller Friday night than it had been at the season’s start.
“Some guys had to take a year absent,” Girard said. “I won’t say any names, but like any other team, we might have some problems with the academic scandal. Some of them just want to take leaves to get more playing time and come back later because they were younger guys. Some other guys were just injured. But overall, they’re going to come back; they’re still part of our family and still part of our team.”
Ford added that the Crimson’s preparation this week did not change despite its lacking certain key contributors.
“We knew going in that other guys were going to have to step up and fill the void,” he said. “I think guys did a good job of that [Friday], and we’re not really changing our team’s mindset at all. We just want to keep going, keep getting better, and keep playing the same way we were playing earlier in the year.”

Playing for the first time in nearly three weeks, the No. 20 Harvard men’s hockey team salvaged a 2-2 tie as the defense led the way against Merrimack on Friday night in North Andover, Mass.
The Crimson (4-3-1, 3-3 ECAC) found itself a man down for nearly a third of the nonconference showdown, and the Harvard penalty killing unit survived a five-minute major penalty that lasted the entire overtime period.
Both of the Crimson’s goals fell within a half-minute window early in the second period, with tallies coming from sophomore forward Tommy O’Regan and freshman defenseman Desmond Bergin.
“I think overall we’re pretty happy with the way we played,” junior defenseman Dan Ford said. “Merrimack is a tough place to play, and we’ve been off for three weeks, so we knew it was going to be a tough game. But I think we’re happy with the effort that we put forth.”
Harvard looked to be in trouble at the end of regulation when captain Danny Biega incurred a major infraction for kneeing. But the Crimson penalty killing line stepped up in the extra period, surrendering no goals and allowing only three shots while down a man.
“With the five minutes, the only way for us to win the game was with a shorthanded goal,” Ford said. “But the first thing was to take care of the defensive zone, and make sure we were doing a good job killing the penalty.”
All of the game’s scoring occurred in the second period of play. O’Regan struck first for Harvard with just under 17 minutes to play in the period. The sophomore took a pass from Bergin near the goal and struck the puck past the Warriors goalie to record his first tally on the season.
The Crimson found the back of the net again just 31 seconds later, and this time the combination was reversed. O’Regan moved the puck into the offensive zone and passed to Bergin, who ripped a shot into the goal to seize a 2-0 lead.
“We just put on more pressure when we started the second period,” Girard said. “That’s what happened in the third, too; I think we dominated the third. We just kept the game going at a really high tempo.”
But Merrimack (5-7-3, 4-4-1 Hockey East) struck right back with two scores of its own in the same period. Harvard looked to add to its lead on a power play, but Warriors forward Rhett Bly snuck past the Crimson defense to score a shorthanded goal.
Merrimack tied the game just over seven minutes later when Warriors forward Mike Collins picked up a rebound and unleashed a strike that found its way above Girard and into the net.
The score remained knotted at two for the rest of the game as the Crimson picked up its first tie of the year.
Merrimack mustered consistent offense throughout the contest and outshot Harvard, 38-24. Girard contributed a solid performance in goal, contributing 36 saves for the game, his second highest total on the season.
The Warriors had plenty of opportunities to set up in the offensive zone. The Crimson committed eight infractions in the contest and had a man in the penalty box for 19 minutes, its highest amount this year and more than double the time Harvard spent on a power play.
But the Crimson played its best defense of the night in penalty time and did not surrender a single power-play goal. Harvard, which is currently ranked fourth in the nation on the penalty kill, has only allowed two goals while down a man this year.
“[The penalty killing unit] kept the guys on the perimeter,” Girard said. “There were no passes that seemed to get through. They just battled, really.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only a month to go before the start of Ivy League play, the Harvard men’s basketball team (4-4) will host Boston University (3-5) Tuesday in its final game before breaking for final exams.
Following Tuesday’s matchup the Crimson will have 11 days off until its next contest against Holy Cross.
Boston University, which is led in scoring by junior guard D.J. Irving, lost five straight games to begin to the season—three coming by three points or fewer—before rebounding to win its last three, twice defeating Coastal Carolina during the winning streak.
When the Crimson last met the Terriers in 2011, the 24th-ranked Crimson emerged victorious on the road, 76-52. Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard knocked down six three-pointers, setting a career high which he later matched in the second round of the NCAA tournament against Vanderbilt. Harvard took a 16-point lead into the break and extended its lead to 24 by the end of the contest.
Against UConn on Friday, Harvard quickly fell behind by 13 points but rebounded to pull within three by halftime. In the second half, the Crimson was unable to even the game, eventually falling 57-49 despite outrebounding UConn and holding the Huskies to only 23.5 percent shooting from beyond the arc.
Harvard has won two of its last three contests—including its only win of the season over an opponent from a BCS conference, a 79-63 win at Boston College on Dec. 4. During the three-game stretch, sophomore forward Wesley Saunders has averaged 16.3 points per game. Saunders earned Ivy League co-player of the week status this week after winning the award outright last week. Saunders has reached double digits in every contest so far.

It's 3 a.m. and you're sick of those endless Folklore and Mythology problem sets. You switch to Netflix but are instantly overwhelmed by the variety. Lucky for you, Flyby is here to guide you through the tireless video store that is Netflix Watch Instantly.
 
1. Disney: As of last week, Netflix carries these vital artifacts from our childhood, saving them from sitting in boxes labeled "VHS" in our home basements. Revisit your p-set free years with movies like "Pocahontas" and "Alice in Wonderland." You can test whether you've kept your humanity throughout the years by seeing if you cry when Dumbo's mother dies.
 
2. Classics: In addition to presents and eggnog, the holidays also mean lots of awkward banter with elder relatives. After watching "Chinatown" and "The Seven Year Itch," you can talk to Great Aunt Sheila about the old days when actresses were known for their talent and not for coke binges (we're looking at you, Lindsay).
 
3. Foreign Films: Study for those foreign language finals by watching foreign films! Spanish final tomorrow? Why not try "Y tu mamá también?" Swedish project due next week? Watch "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" (or, as they say in Sweden, "Män som hatar kvinnor") in its native language. Even if you're not studying the language, you gain ten classy points every time you mention "foreign film" at your New Year's cocktail party.
 
4. Cult Favorites: Instead of researching mid-century American realist paintings, try to figure out why movies like "Clerks" and "Reefer Madness" retain such cachet amongst a small group of eternally devoted fans. Don't worry—these movies are much safer than drinking the Kool-Aid.
 
5. Musicals: Get out those tap shoes and join your roommates in a can-can line. Go contemporary and watch the remake of "Footloose" (2011) or embrace the spooky with "The Phantom of the Opera." Don't be so quick to push aside "Grease II," the sequel to John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John's blockbuster. Actually, considering that the only character still remaining is Frenchy, feel free to push it aside.
