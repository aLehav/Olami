After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 7, the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford, where I used to teach, announced that a student had tested positive for COVID-19. Yet she concluded, Public Health England “has advised that the risk to other students and to staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue.… we do not need to take any additional public health actions in light of this case.”
Really? Oxfordshire now has around 2000 confirmed cases of the virus. At least one of my former colleagues has died from it.
At the end of February, before Oxford’s first case was confirmed, we already knew how bad it was getting — especially in Italy, which already had over 2000 confirmed cases and was preparing to take spring classes online.
Imagine if Oxford had not waited two more weeks to send students home.. Better yet, imagine if the students themselves had told the vice chancellor, “Sorry, no, we have a confirmed case of the virus among us, the thing is spreading like wildfire abroad, make it possible for us to learn from home.” No tutorials, no dining halls, no college feasts, but also no pubs, no rowing. Self-imposed early lockdown. With the lecturers calling for it, too.
But Oxford did wait. And they were not alone. People around the world, all of us, waited to be told to stay home. And now, prematurely by almost every measure, we are pushing governments to let us free again, or we are breaking the laws and freeing ourselves. Governments around the world are, in turn, scrambling, chaotically and inconsistently, to do something, not even knowing which rules to put in place next week.
The experience of COVID-19 offers proof of a controversial claim: that our fascination with and reliance on top-down rules are doing more harm than good. Rules, laws, and decrees are helpful guides, but they cannot, and should not, do the work for us. We should not be waiting for them to tell us how to behave. For the social contract is indeed broken, and law and order are at least part of the problem.
I can be so suspicious of rules and laws because my own professional life as a professor of government and law, and a consultant to foreign governments around the globe, including Iraq, has been an attempt to find the secrets of order through rules: to craft good laws and good constitutions to help people get along. But I now believe it may have been backward. And COVID is unfortunately proving my point.
Didn’t the decrees and rules on social distancing help save lives, slow the spread of the virus? Undoubtedly. But what if we had all acted earlier, without waiting to be told? Using the unprecedented number of social media tools available to us — Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and so on — we could have communicated instantaneously and organized our own confinement. Without waiting for governments and leaders, too concerned about our liberty, the economy, or their own political futures, to act quickly. How many lives might we have saved if we had not waited for laws to save us, but instead used easily available tools and information to save ourselves?
What I am suggesting is bottom-up civil obedience, not to an authority, but to ourselves. Spontaneous, self-enforcing cooperation across racial and ethnic lines that starts locally and individually; and weaves a fabric of immediate trust, providing the basis for social interaction at a macro level, providing perhaps the only form of social glue that will enable civilization’s discontents to get along and take care of each other.
This idea is not new. The Cynics in Ancient Greece believed in virtue as the only good organizing principle of a state, and they were right. Nineteenth-century lawmakers such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon declared a strong suspicion of the law, a kind of unresolved ambivalence about it. Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s early work on children warned against a reliance on institutions and rules, and John Holt, the father of “unschooling,” encouraged young citizens to think for themselves and break free of traditional forms of learning.
We need to also learn from the few pioneers now, such as villagers in Spain, a country at a breaking point from the virus, where some refused to wait for central authorities and instead acted on their own. Piling mud or concrete blocks to cut off roads leading in and out of their villages, they embraced confinement to spare themselves from the virus.
Mine is not a call for anarchy or mob rule — not in a time when governmental action is at least just about saving us from the worst extinction our planet has known since World War II. Rather, it is a call for us to take a step back and think about life before we got to the dire state we are now in, and ask ourselves what we, as a society, might have done when we first read on our smartphones how pernicious, and fast, this virus was.
Spontaneous, decentralized social movements were the start of the civil rights movement in the United States. Similar movements brought down the Berlin Wall and ended the Cold War. They brought down longstanding dictatorships during the Arab Spring. Could they not have also brought down a virus? Not through protest this time, but as a self-organizing, virus-fighting network of informed individuals taking responsibility for their lives and the lives of others.
Why don’t we use this moment in our history as a catalyst to build a true civil society, one that has never, could never, exist on a global level, until now? So when the next challenge comes — because it will — we can say, “We have this.” And we can mean it this time.

Harvard will not pursue layoffs or furloughs “at this time" because of “uncertainty” regarding the fall semester, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote in an email Tuesday to Harvard affiliates.
The coronavirus pandemic has roiled Harvard’s financial outlook via “substantial” declines in the endowment, unforeseen expenses, and stymied revenue from sources like executive and continuing education. The University is currently projecting a $750 million revenue shortfall in Fiscal Year 2021.
Lapp also wrote that the University will extend guaranteed pay and benefits for direct employees and contract workers — including dining, custodial, and security services — beyond June 28, the date to which the University had previously committed.
The prospect of furloughs and layoffs, which administrators previously floated, sparked outrage and concern from employees and students. In fact, Lapp made her announcement less than an hour before a scheduled protest over possible layoffs.
Lapp also announced three “voluntary workforce programs” for University employees on Tuesday, including an early retirement incentive, vacation balance reduction, and time reduction.
The retirement incentive program provides eligible staff who opt to retire early an additional benefit equal to one year of pay, while the vacation balance reduction program encourages employees to spend down accrued vacation time this summer and fall to “help reduce costs for their local departments.”
The voluntary time reduction program allows staff to submit proposals to reduce their work hours and pay by 10 to 50 percent for at least two months. Lapp wrote that, in addition to assisting the University’s financial situation, the program is meant to provide “flexibility for personal/caregiving responsibilities, personal renewal, stress reduction and wellbeing, a transition to early retirement, or simply enjoying more of the summer.”
“We hope that everyone will contribute to Harvard’s financial sustainability and eventual financial recovery, either through participation in one of these voluntary programs, or backing up and covering for coworkers who may elect them,” Lapp wrote. “We all have a role to play.”
Lapp also wrote about the University’s work to resume some campus operations in parallel with plans laid out by Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79.
“Aligning with Governor Baker’s plan for the phased re-opening of the state, the University, as well as individual Schools and Units, are developing plans to safely bring students, faculty, other academic personnel, and staff back to campus as conditions allow,” Lapp wrote.
Though some of the University’s employees currently work remotely, “a limited number of workers” have been reporting to campus for an “essential on-site role.”
Others are “participating” in the University’s phased reopening of laboratory facilities as part of a plan Harvard announced last month.
Lapp added most of Harvard’s workers will continue to work remotely through “at least” the end of summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Police officers are now required to attempt to stop their colleagues from using unreasonable force, Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. announced in a General Order Monday.
Unlike previous legislation, which required officers to report use of force violations to their superior officers, the new order mandates officers to take a “preventative or active” approach before another officer conducts “unethical or inappropriate” behavior.
“It shall be the duty of all sworn members of the Cambridge Police Department present at any scene where physical force is being applied, to either stop, or attempt to stop, another member of the Department when force is being unreasonably applied or is no longer required,” the order read.
Bard said the order was meant to emphasize officers’ duty to prevent the use of excessive force.
“We continually examine our policies to ensure that they meet the state’s requirements, conform to the very best practices in policing, and prioritize the sanctity of human life,” Bard wrote in a statement Monday. “While we feel that most, if not all, of our policies directly align with the spirit of what is being asked for in the recommendations, an area where we felt we could be more explicit was the duty to intervene and stop excessive force by other officers.”
The order also offered suggestions on how an officer should verbally or physically intervene to prevent another officer from using unreasonable force.
“If appropriate, you could tell the officer to ‘cool it’ or that you’ll take over the matter and have them step aside,” the order reads. “If necessary, step in between the officer and the individual or hold the officer back in order to stop him/her from inflicting more unreasonable force.”
In the event an officer fails to intervene, they may be subject to disciplinary action, civil liability, or criminal prosecution, according to the order.
CPD’s new policy comes as protests across the nation call for police abolition and reform after the recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black people by police.
On May 30, CPD released a statement mourning Floyd’s death and emphasizing the need to “constantly critique” and “analyze” department practices to better meet the needs of Cambridge residents.
“George Floyd’s death is the most recent reminder of the racial injustice that exists in our nation,” the statement read. “At the Cambridge Police Department, we constantly critique, analyze how we do things, work to find solutions and identify best practices that most effectively meet the needs and ensure the safety of the Cambridge community.”
At Monday’s City Council Meeting, almost 400 Cambridge residents signed up to provide public comments on a city policy order to redirect the proposed $4.1 million increase in police budget for 2021 toward measures promoting public health and safety.
According to the proposed 2021 city budget, CPD anticipates a budget increase from almost $62 million to roughly $66 million, making up nine percent of the city’s $715 million operating budget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal grand jury indicted former Harvard chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber on two counts for making false statements to federal investigators who were examining funding he received from the Chinese government, the Department of Justice announced Tuesday.
Lieber will be arraigned at a later date. The charge of making false statements allows for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000, according to a DOJ press release.
The first count alleges that Lieber purposely told federal investigators in 2018 that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program and that he “wasn’t sure” how China categorized him. In fact, representatives of Wuhan University of Technology in China previously asked Lieber to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, and he signed a three-year contract as a One Thousand Talent “high level foreign expert” in 2012, according to charging documents.
The Chinese government established the Thousand Talents Program in 2008, hoping to attract scholars from across the world to contribute to Chinese development. The U.S. government has since said the program poses a danger to national security.
The grand jury also indicted Lieber on a second charge of making false statements for causing Harvard to tell the National Institutes of Health in 2019 that he had never participated in the Thousand Talents Program.
Federal authorities arrested Lieber on Jan. 28; Harvard placed him on paid administrative leave later that day. Lieber was released after accepting a $1 million bail agreement.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that the University is reviewing the indictment.
Lieber’s lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey, wrote in an emailed statement that the government “has this wrong.”
“Professor Lieber has dedicated his life to science and to his students,” Mukasey wrote. “Not money, not fame, just his science and his students. He is the victim in this case, not the perpetrator.”
Mukasey added that his client will be fighting the charges.
“When justice is done, Charlie’s good name will be restored and the scientific community again will be able to benefit from his intellect and passion,” Mukasey wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University will conduct a new review of its police department to evaluate its policing procedures, including how it collaborates with local law enforcement, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday.
The review comes after the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police on May 25 ignited national and global protests over police brutality and systemic racism. A photo that surfaced on Twitter last week showing a Harvard University Police Department officer at a protest in Boston prompted swift backlash — prompting questions from affiliates and the broader public about why Harvard police were dispatched to the protest and reigniting calls to abolish the department.
Bacow wrote that the presence of seven Harvard police officers at a protest in Boston last week raises “legitimate questions.”
He also noted that Harvard police monitored the protest as part of its mutual aid agreement with Boston and Cambridge police.
“In times of need, Boston and Cambridge police routinely render assistance to us when we have large events on our campus, including concerts, major athletic contests, and Commencement, as well as protests that attract large crowds that often include non-Harvard affiliates,” Bacow wrote. “Similarly, we render assistance when needed.”
Bacow wrote that national protests and unrest over racism in policing have “rightly served” as a “catalyst” for such conversations and “how we must reimagine the role of our institutions in providing public safety and security.”
To that end, he wrote that Harvard will begin a new review of the department to scrutinize its relationship with local law enforcement agencies and ensure that mutual aid agreements are “aligned with community policing values” at Harvard. The independent review announced Wednesday will supplement an internal review launched in February.
“Earlier this year, an internal review of HUPD was announced, prompted by allegations of racism within the department and use of excessive force in apprehending people on our campus, specifically people of color,” Bacow wrote.
Harvard previously retained a pair of top law enforcement experts with experience at the United States Department of Justice — Brenda Bond and Ronald L. Davis — to oversee the review.
Under the new review, their roles will be expanded. Bacow noted that Bond and Davis will take into consideration recommendations from the internal working group of HUPD officers when making its own independent recommendations.
Bond and Davis will report directly to Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who will share their findings with affiliates in the fall.
Wednesday’s announcement comes on the heels of a tumultuous year for HUPD.
An investigation published by The Crimson in January uncovered racism and sexism within the department, prompting students to hold rallies, call for the department’s abolishment, and demand police chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley’s resignation.
The Crimson’s investigation also led Harvard to initiate a review into the culture of HUPD and its dealings with Harvard affiliates. Less than a month after the review was launched, the department faced new criticism for allegations of police brutality leveled against one of its officers.
Amid nationwide scrutiny of police, Riley announced his retirement Monday, effective by the end of the calendar year. Bacow said Harvard will launch a national search for his successor.
Riley will engage with the internal working group and the law enforcement experts as both groups set out to draft a set of recommendations for the department. The working group will continue to report to Riley while he remains the department’s chief, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. Previously, the leadership of Harvard’s police union questioned the integrity of the working group due to its ties to Riley.
Bacow said the independent review would serve as a “crucial resource” for Harvard affiliates and the new leader of HUPD.
Bacow faced criticism for his initial response to Floyd’s death and ensuing protests. In a May 30 email to affiliates, he espoused his “beliefs” in America’s values and the “goodness” of its people — though he stopped short of supporting the protests or endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement.
In the email Wednesday morning, though, Bacow struck a more direct tone.
“Black lives matter, and we must use this moment to confront and remedy racial injustice. Too many precious lives have been lost,” he wrote. “Peaceful protests and raised voices in Cambridge and Boston, across the country, and around the world rightly demand real and meaningful change, change that will truly ensure equal justice for all.”
Correction: June 10, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that neither an internal working group of Harvard police officers nor outside reviewers will report to outgoing Chief Francis D. "Bud" Riley. In fact, the internal working group will continue to report to Riley before he retires this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many Massachusetts retailers, hair salons, and diners reopened Monday as part of the Commonwealth’s reopening plan, Cambridge business owners say the COVID-19 pandemic has forced them to reassess and reimagine how their businesses operate.
The reopening plan set forth by Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 entered its second phase Monday, permitting businesses like child care facilities, hotels, retailers, and other personal services to open with social distancing guidelines in place. Restaurants can now offer outdoors dining in addition to take out.
Yet for many small businesses in Cambridge, Baker’s reopening plan signals a slow economic recovery. With decreased foot traffic and social distancing guidelines still in place, business owners must weather heavy financial losses and navigate an uncertain future.
At Pyara Spa and Salon, owner Christine Perkins said her business reopened with the doors still locked. In accordance with social distancing protocols, Pyara Spa and Salon checks in customers with reservations and uses only half of its eight service stations.
“[Customers] are washing their hands right away or hand sanitizing before they even come into our space,” Perkins explained. “They then are guided kind of into a queue of social distancing spots in the front of the salon, and we don’t allow people to walk through the salon.”
Still, Perkins said she believes the reopening plan should offer business owners increased latitude.
“We have skin in the game basically to keep everyone safe,” she said. “If you have a business like mine that doesn’t do the right thing, we’re not going to have guests coming through our doors.”
With her business operating at half capacity, Perkins said she faces significant economic challenges. Her distributors estimate a third of salons will close permanently in the Commonwealth.
“Salons and restaurants are such small profit margins,” she said. “We do it because we love it, not because we want to make a ton of money.”
Businesses in Harvard Square are also struggling to stay afloat as students reside off campus and customers stay home. Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said many retailers and restaurants have been forced to do business online or have “morphed” into different side businesses.
At Grendel’s Den, owner Kari Kueltzer turned her restaurant and bar into a grocery outpost, offering curbside pickup for vegetable bundles and provision boxes stocked with rice, cheese, or produce.
Kueltzer estimates that, because of absent University affiliates and social distancing restrictions, Grendel’s Den will earn only 30 percent of its usual annual revenue.
She said she believes sit-down restaurants may lose “upwards of 85 chairs out of every hundred chairs,” which will increase the demand and price for table seating.
“I worry very much that it will become a very inequitable landscape for people who want to sit and eat, and [dining in] will become almost a luxury product,” she said. “That will be a very hard thing for me to watch happen, given that Grendel’s has always been committed to providing value and equity to people in the community who have varying degrees of means.”
Even restaurants whose takeout services are popular will likely face heavy financial losses.
Jon Eller — the general manager at El Jefe’s, a taqueria that usually serves as a late-night mainstay for undergraduates — said the restaurant's revenue has tumbled nearly 60 percent. Because it has limited outdoor seating available, his business will be largely unaffected during this stage of reopening.
“Partial opening, it doesn’t change much for us at all because we don’t have a patio, so Phase Two for us is still the same as what we were doing before, except that now it does affect us a little because now people have other options,” Eller said.
Adam DiCenso, the owner of Pinocchio’s Pizza, said that though his restaurant has been able to fulfill takeout orders without disruption, it has lost two of its main client bases: Harvard students and tourists. He estimates Pinocchio’s Pizza is off roughly 75 percent of its normal earnings.
“We’ve had to scale way, way back,” DiCenso said. “Under sort of normal times, a big bulk of our takeout and our online food orders are to students. So what we’re getting now is basically the Cambridge area residents.”
Phase 3 of the state’s reopening is scheduled to start as early as June 29. Gyms, select bars, casinos, museums, theaters, overnight camps, classes and select recreational businesses will be permitted to reopen.
The final phase of Baker’s plan, Phase 4, follows no regulated timeframe and is contingent on the development of an effective treatment or vaccine. Following the arrival of a highly effective treatment or vaccine, the Commonwealth will allow nightclubs and other large venue activities to reopen.
Originally, all bars were in the Phase 3 category; but on Monday, bars without food service were moved into Phase 4. In both phases, businesses will have to implement and enforce stringent crowd control and social distancing measures.
The pandemic has yet to permanently shutter any restaurants, retailers or other businesses in Harvard Square, according to Jillson. But she stressed that there remains a long path to economic recovery ahead.
“The economic ruination cannot be overstated,” Jillson said. “It's going to take 18 months… to two years, before they are back to where they were before the crisis began, and if they ever get back to the same level, I'm not sure.”
Business owners understand the need for a careful reopening, but are still eager to resume normal operations, Eller said.
“We’re just going with the flow basically, trying to keep up, trying to follow what needs to be done and all the protocols, and make sure everyone is safe,” Eller said. “Obviously, we want to be open and back to normal, but we understand that this can take some time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The word vision has always moved and inspired me. Having been a point guard all my life, I always prided myself on having floor vision: seeing the game, reading the defense, and setting up teammates. When I decided to attend Duke to play for Coach K, I did so because of the vision he had for Duke Basketball. When I first got to Harvard 13 years ago, I arrived with a vision of my own: to create a basketball program befitting of the world’s greatest university. I wanted for basketball to play a role in connecting our campus, and to assist Harvard President Drew Faust, and now President Larry Bacow, in our campus’s “One Harvard” mission. Since that time, I am proud to say we have achieved that vision, and that our program has educated diverse “scholars and ballers” — on and off the court.
Vision is in my DNA. Today, I’m writing about a new vision. A far more important vision. A vision that has stirred something in me.
2020 vision.
I’m not talking about eyesight, exactly. You don’t have to have eyesight to have vision. But I am talking about all of us seeing 2020 in 20-20. I’m talking about all of us uniting around a vision to make our country, and even the world, a better place. And I’m urging our nation’s young people, the next generation, to take the lead in making it happen — because only you can do it.
One of the benefits of technology, and video in particular, is that it “opens our eyes.” It makes all of us see and feel things differently. Maybe you heard about “the George Floyd video;” but when you saw it, I bet you felt differently. In the past days we have yet again seen the deep divide that still exists in our country. We have seen the reality that race is still very much a factor in American life, and that communities of color disproportionately suffer socially, politically and economically. We have seen our nation struggle in the face of a global pandemic. We have seen a lack of compassionate leadership accelerate so many of these problems. None of this is breaking news. We have known about it. But now, we have all seen it — with “2020 vision.”
I am urging our nation’s young people to “be the change [they] want to see in the world.” I am urging young people, especially the Class of 2020, to share in my vision: a vision in which 2020 is the year we make significant progress on the road to defeat racism and systemic inequality. Call me “crazy,” but I believe we are facing this crisis at this time for a reason. When you see things in 2020, your vision is not clouded or blurred. Our vision no longer is.
Every generation has moments that define it. I believe we are in one of those moments now. Whether you are black and wealthy, white and poor, or anything in between, you have a role in this. I believe you don’t choose your destiny; destiny chooses you. Destiny has chosen. To our nation’s young people: you have been taught. Now is the time to lead. And please know, we are here to serve you.
It’s your time and it’s your turn.
I see the vision in 20-20. Do you?
