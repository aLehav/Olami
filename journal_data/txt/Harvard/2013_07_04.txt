After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Towards the end of Zack Snyder’s “Man of Steel,” there is a flashback to a time when Clark Kent was still a young boy. In the scene, his adoptive human father (Kevin Costner) speculates heavy-handedly on the weight his son’s preternaturally strong shoulders will someday have to hold. Possibilities include the future of the human race, modern science’s concept of extraterrestrial life, and school buses full of young children. For all their metaphorical and physical power, however, by the end of the film, the shoulders themselves are more impressive than anything they support. Henry Cavill is pitch perfect in the role of Superman. He smirks at the bad guys and grins openly at the good. He hugs his mother fiercely and smacks his opponent General Zod—played by a woefully miscast Michael Shannon—around with the same intensity. His charm and stunning good looks are enough to carry the film, but only just.
 
The running time of two and a half hours is excessive and poorly paced. Major plot elements are skimmed over quickly in the final half of the film, while the introductory sequence on Krypton is overly ponderous and spends so much time with Russell Crowe, as Superman’s father Jor-El, that it’s easy to think he’s the main character. The usually sparkling Amy Adams falls flat in the role of Lois Lane, and Costner’s Jonathan Kent often seems oddly confused and dazed for a character built up to be the moral paragon of the film. The cast, though talented, seems pale and lifeless next to the ever-vital Superman, whose position of inhuman power is often driven home by laughably unsubtle comparisons to Christ.  As a whole, your time might be better spent watching the “Man of Steel” trailer in place of the film, unless you want to see Cavill in spandex, which is entirely understandable.

“The Kings of Summer,” which debuted earlier this year as “Toy’s House” at the Sundance Film Festival, turns a predictable story line into an unexpectedly enjoyable film. High school best friends Joe (Nick Robinson) and Patrick (Gabriel Basso), and their eccentric companion Biaggio (Moises Arias), run away from home and build a house in the woods. The audience is invited to briefly suspend its disbelief when the three boys miraculously piece together a large and sturdy structure, but within this mildly fantastical framework, the film offers an honest and viciously witty take on the fits, starts, and struggles of young adulthood. 
 
The screenplay is engaging and amusing, if not imaginative. Close friendships are tested; sour family bonds are (partially) mended; a teenage romance turns into a love triangle. The obligatory overbearing parents deliver some of the best humor in the movie, thanks in particular to the famous deadpan of Nick Offerman from “Parks and Recreation.”
 
Some of the most enjoyable moments of the film are found in montages of the boys romping through the woods, playing drums with sticks on a rusty pipe, chopping a watermelon in mid-air, and diving off the side of a rock into a pond. Beautiful cinematography combines with excellent music and editing to give the scenes an almost enchanting quality. These montages invitingly conjure the feelings of escape and freedom that motivate teenage rebellion.
 
A classic coming-of-age film, “Kings of Summer” succeeds as a genre piece and excels thanks to its lovely photography and delightfully surprising humor. It is a feel-good movie for a summer night, well worth seeing.

“Mother nature  is a serial killer—no one is better or more creative.” With these foreboding words, “World War Z” introduces a world where humanity is at war with the undead. Starring Brad Pitt as former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane, this globetrotting adventure is a visual stunner, packing together epic set pieces to deafening music and nonstop action. Beneath all this chaos, however, lies a disappointing movie with a mediocre, clichéd plot and unresolved story arcs.
 
“World War Z” starts off relatively strong. Director Marc Forster ably depicts a paranoid public scrambling for cover as government officials seek to unravel the mysteries surrounding the pandemic. However, the movie quickly loses momentum. After a confusing and underwhelming plot twist, the film becomes all too predictable as Pitt is tasked with finding a cure for the pandemic. With an unoriginal premise, Forster does not take the initiative to expand the zombie genre, and the movie pales in comparison to more innovative treatments such as “The Walking Dead” and “Contagion.”  
 
Even more disappointing is the lack of resolution as the movie draws to a close. Early in the story, Forster presents interesting narratives to explore the potential causes of the plague, with ideas ranging from supernatural to environmental. Key moments of the first half are dedicated to accounts of Indian “rakshasas,” mythological undead soldiers. Yet, these accounts never make their way back into the second half and this only heightens the disappointment at the simplified, unsatisfying conclusion that Forster eventually serves up.
 
“World War Z” sadly sets itself up for failure—opting for visual delight at the expense of plot development, Forster delivers a movie as cold and brainless as the zombies themselves.

The obvious risk in recreating a play that has already been performed many thousands of times is unoriginality. Evidently, this is a risk of which most Shakespeare directors are terribly afraid: it seems each stage production of one of his plays, and even more so each film, must be set in an era never before attempted, cast in an atypical fashion, and utilize domineeringly unpredictable visuals. And indeed, Joss Whedon’s adaptation of “Much Ado About Nothing” seems to continue the pattern based on its poster, which inexplicably features an almost entirely black-and-white image of the character Claudio snorkeling in a lake and holding some red mixed drink. Hardly traditional Shakespeare.
  Yet what Whedon has done in adapting one of Shakespeare’s most well-known comedies is far more revolutionary than what any technological innovation or skilled costume designer could provide. He steps back almost completely as a director, so much so that one occasionally falls under the illusion of watching a stage production due to the remarkably understated visuals. The choice to film entirely in black and white is an unmitigated success—the grayscale is not some pretentious trick, but in fact an intelligent and efficient way of pulling all but the source text into the film’s background. Throughout the movie, Shakespeare’s words shine above all else, and it is thus unsurprising that the film succeeds most during moments in which the comedy is entirely textual: Benedick and Beatrice’s cleverly crafted banter, for example, or Dogberry’s complete miscomprehension of the English language.
  Of course, Whedon’s film is not a stage production, and this leaves the more plot-driven scenes feeling rather dull. The scheming of Don John and Conrade (a feminization of Conrad, who is male in the original play) remains fairly boring despite Whedon’s rather unimaginative attempt to add interest by inserting a sexual relationship between the pair. On stage, even these less interesting scenes would remain engaging, simply because live theater has a force and energy that cannot be replicated on a screen.
  Though Whedon’s simplification approach is thus at times overly stark, it does far more good than bad—not simply for the film itself, but one hopes, for Shakespeare adaptation as a whole. Yes, stunning visuals and bizarre transformations of time and place can work in reconfigurations of Shakespeare plays and may even be themselves important creative strides. But only a film like Whedon’s, one that holds the play’s text in a position of absolute primacy, demonstrates an understanding of why we bother to adapt Shakespeare in the first place.

The most surprising aspect of the National Security Agency’s massive domestic surveillance operation, which hoards and mines data like dwarves do gold, is how utterly unsurprised everyone is. Secretive spying is apparently one of those heartbreaking realities you have to begrudgingly accept nowadays­—just as most people come to realize that every delicious dessert is actually part of a secret conspiracy to kill you.
But is the NSA really as benign as a beignet?
Initially I had some anxiety about living in a society in which the location, length and number dialed of any phone call I made is vacuumed up and stored in an NSA mega-warehouse more expensive than the Hoover dam. The fact that all this was actually legal, because of an eerily Kafkaesque system of secret courts, secret opinions, and secret law was more unnerving. But what was most disconcerting was the blithely bipartisan support the no-longer-secret surveillance received­—a collegial agreement between Barack Obama and Mitch McConnell is about as unsettling as a Bachmann-Palin 2016 ticket.
However, a few things reassured me: the fact that well-vetted and reliable 30-year-olds have unfettered access to national secrets, the completely honest reactions of officials confronted with their own dishonesty, and, especially, the ringing endorsement by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin, looking at America’s fledgling authoritarian state with a wry smirk the way warm-blooded humans might swoon over bumbling babies, agreed that it was “the way a civilized society should go about fighting terrorism.”
“That’s the way it’s done in the U.S., and that’s the way it’s done in Russia,” the tsar-like autocrat fond of jailing dissident punk rockers and (allegedly) stealing Super Bowl rings reassured the nation. The delightful equivalence is all the more haunting when you remember that Guantanamo is basically a climate-controlled Gulag.
While Mother Russia mothers away, American officials are still seeking to soothe a rattled public with a gaggle of venerable public servants like Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee on March 12, the bald Clapper clapped out what some would call a bald-faced lie, averring that the U.S. does “not wittingly” collect information on millions of Americans.
The allegations made by whistleblower-traitor-leaker extraordinaire Edward Snowden that “I, sitting at my desk, had the authority to wiretap any body…even the president of the United States,” were roundly denounced by General Keith Alexander, director of the NSA.
When asked by Senator Susan Collins of Maine whether “he could tap into virtually any American’s phone calls or e-mails,” Alexander, head of an organization that can tap into virtually any American’s phone calls or e-mails, claimed that he knew of no way to do that.
But what are a few purported white lies among friends? Nothing can go wrong under the transparent oversight of a secret intelligence court, gagged Senators, and a tight-lipped executive branch.
Even better: some of the most ardent supporters of the program are the ones who have been most skeptical of massive government databases in the past.
Judge Roger Vinson, who authored the secret court ruling mandating that Verizon give call records on all of its American customers on an “ongoing, daily basis,” also ruled the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. Uncle Sam turning Peeping Tom on phone records seemed fine, but requiring health insurance was a “bridge too far” in his words.
Lindsey Graham opposed gun registration as creeping tyranny, but is very content with letting the tyrants creep through his communications. Then again, one can always count on a Republican to fervently pursue the sham scandal rather than the real one, like those harping about the fictional death panels in Obamacare rather than the actual death panel determining who gets droned next.
You could expect Congress authorizing a wall of fire on the Mexican border before a firewall between the government and the governed.
Between strange bedfellows like Rand Paul and Ron Wyden, a genuine debate on national security and civil liberties risked eruption. Fortunately, the dialogue will be stifling by the much more pressing and made-for-TV spectacle of ‘Where in the World is Edward Snowden?’

The phone rings. It’s Dad.
“How’s your day? Have you heard about this Edward Snowden thing yet?”
I try to keep from groaning, from rolling my eyes back; I exhale to cloak my frustration.
Of course I know about Edward Snowden. I am interning at a major news organization this summer. Snowden is all I have heard about for the past four days.
But in my regular everyday life, I probably would have missed the Snowden story. Though I write for the school newspaper, I don’t often read the news—people will speak up when important things happen. I get my news from word of mouth, from articles recommended and conversations over meals. Human contact is my path to becoming informed.
But this summer my internship requires that I keep up with the news in Washington DC: the city that often makes American news. DC teems with newsmakers--the politicians who decide how to change the country with new policies, and the reporters who tell everyone about it, spread the news.
Being news-savvy in America’s news hotspot demands a new approach. No more secondhand news-gathering from lunchtime chatter with friends. I now need to be the first to know, so I buckle down, tune out, plug in. I look down to my iPhone to get the latest on what’s happening all around me. I can’t be everywhere at once.
Between Twitter and Flipboard, SCOTUS blog, Facebook and the New York Times homepage every now and again, I’m starting to be more on top of worldly events. When my dad calls to inform me about Snowden I get frustrated—I could tell him Snowden facts for days because of my work and my news-following. By all standard accounts, I am informed.
But I’m also trading looking up for news to looking down for news. I’m seeing less of real life in real time to process more news.   New information seeps out of screens, out of lips, and I’m on processing overload.
Where does the news really come from, anyway?

Mark G. Charest, a former Harvard Ph.D. student, has filed a lawsuit against the University and chemistry and chemical biology professor Andrew G. Myers, seeking an estimated $10 million as compensation for alleged breach of contract and fraud, among other allegations.
 
The complaint, which was filed on Friday, alleges that Charest was not properly compensated for a discovery resulting from his research on synthetic tetracycline antibiotics in Myers’s laboratory. Charest claims that in 2005, the year after he received his Ph.D. in chemistry and chemical biology, he was coerced into agreeing to take a smaller share of patent royalties than he would have been allocated under Harvard’s policy had he not signed the agreement.
 
The lawsuit asserts that Charest was further cheated in 2009 when a percentage of his royalties was allocated to a new patent on which he was not listed as an author and has not received any compensation. According to the lawsuit, Charest later unsuccessfully appealed the decision, and 45 percent of his royalties were ultimately reallocated.
 
An emailed statement Tuesday provided by University spokesperson Kevin Galvin defended the University’s intellectual property policy, maintaining it had been followed in Charest’s case.
 
“Harvard’s intellectual property policy was properly designed, and appropriately implemented with respect to Dr. Charest and his contribution to the advances in synthetic tetracycline antibiotics that occurred in Dr. Andrew Myers's laboratory,” the statement said.
 
The University’s statement also claims that Charest and his three non-faculty colleagues had “all approved of the royalty share that they received.” Regarding the 2009 patent dispute, the statement contends that Charest had “agreed to abide by Harvard’s appeals process regarding the reallocation of royalties once Harvard licensed a second patent for an invention in which Dr. Charest played no part: A panel of disinterested faculty experts reviewed and rejected Dr. Charest’s assessment of the value of his personal contribution to the tetracycline inventions.”
 
But Brian O’Reilly, an attorney with the New York-based litigation firm O’Reilly IP representing Charest in the case, contested the University’s response in an emailed statement of his own on Wednesday. Writing that Charest “never agreed to abide by the Harvard appeal panel decision,” O’Reilly refuted the University’s claim that the appeal panel rejected the value of Charest’s contributions to the discovery.
 
“No one, including the appeal panel, has ever disputed Dr. Charest's personal contribution to the groundbreaking tetracycline inventions,” O’Reilly said. “The only issue the panel decided was the relative value of the pioneering tetracycline patents and the latter added method patent; a decision that was at odds with Harvard’s [intellectual property] policy.”
 
In an emailed statement Wednesday, Charest called interactions with Harvard about the dispute “exceedingly difficult and frustrating.”
 
“There has been a lack of collaborative spirit and transparency in the process from the outset,” Charest said. “I have openly explored every avenue to work toward resolution of the various ‘valuation issues’ over the years.”
 
According to O’Reilly, he and Charest wrote to Harvard and Myers on May 28 requesting a settlement, to which Harvard and Myers’s counsel responded through a letter refusing the offer on June 27.
 
Myers did not respond to a request for comment, and Derek Barton, a senior administrative manager for research who manages Myers’s laboratories, could not be reached for comment this week.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: July 9, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted a statement from former Ph.D. Mark G. Charest about his interactions with Harvard regarding a royalties dispute. In fact, Charest claimed that from the “outset,” not from the “outside,” the process has lacked collaboration and transparency.
