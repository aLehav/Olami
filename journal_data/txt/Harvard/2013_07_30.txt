After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
KIGALI, Rwanda—Nelson Mandela famously said, “Talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. Talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” The quote certainly sounds good, but I have spent most of my life in English-speaking countries, and I never really saw the reality of it until the summer.
Now, I see it every day. Rwanda is a place with a pretty substantial number of foreigners, but a white person still stands out almost anywhere. Walking around, especially away from affluent areas, almost everyone stares, curious and awkward. Sometimes they pause to politely greet me in English or French, and then they go back to staring.
But I find that if I respond with even a basic greeting in Kinyarwanda—the national language, spoken by all Rwandans and almost no one else—the tension fades, and they crack a smile. The friendly greeting often turns into a conversation, and occasionally quite a lot more. On several occasions, I have been astounded at the generosity shown to me by complete strangers with extremely limited means. Every instance is different, and I am sure there are many factors involved, but conversations with Rwandans and expats have given me the strong impression that language contributes a lot.
I had never thought of the language I speak being such a critical part of who I am. Kinyarwanda, however, is spoken in so limited an area that its speakers see it as a big part of their shared identity—and the foreigner who makes an effort to learn gets some respect for it.
But then again, being in a place where I hear so little English spoken, I find that talking to Americans is actually kind of liberating. To hear someone speaking in American English, using the accent and colloquialisms that exist nowhere else—it makes me feel comfortable, in a way that is tough to describe. You could say, I guess, that it goes to my heart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Following the University’s filing of its Institutional Master Plan for Allston development on Friday, the Harvard-Allston Task Force polled residents at its meeting Monday evening about their priorities for open space improvements to be included as part of a neighborhood community benefits package.
 
The benefits package, which is being developed in tandem with the master plan, will include projects and initiatives intended to improve the neighborhood. Harvard and city officials have said that task force members will help inform priorities for the community benefits package.
 
At Monday night’s meeting, Allston-Brighton residents in attendance were asked to fill out a worksheet ranking potential open space benefits. Items listed on the handout included dog parks, bikeways, commuter rail access, and streetscapes on roads such as North Harvard Street and Western Avenue.
 
In accompanying discussion, Tim McHale, a Brighton resident who sits on the task force, detailed a possible benefit listed on the handout called the “emerald bracelet,” which would include several parks connected by bikeways throughout the neighborhood. Thomas M. Lally, an Allston resident, suggested from the audience that Wi-Fi, which was not listed on the handout, would be a desirable community benefit.
 
Christina L. Marin, a task force member who is helping lead the task force’s discussion about open space improvements for the benefits package, said the handout that residents filled out was not a binding vote.
 
“It’s not something that’s set in stone. It’s simply meant to take your pulse in this moment in the process,” Marin said. She added that the results from the “poll,” as she termed it, will be used alongside feedback from previous conversations to determine what the task force will ultimately present as residents’ community benefit priorities.
 
Amidst this discussion about open space improvements, task force chair and Allston resident Ray V. Mellone said that the task force needs to both show “some progress” that would benefit both the community and Harvard and to be able to determine its basic priorities for community benefits.
 
“We’re at the stage where we need to assemble a means for doing that,” Mellone said.
 
The meeting also featured a short presentation from Harvard about the master plan, which the University hopes to have approved by the Boston city government in October. Residents have a 60-day period to submit comment on the master plan, a draft of which was filed with the city government last October.
 
The task force decided at its meeting Monday that its next meeting—scheduled for this upcoming Monday, Aug. 5—will focus on discussion of the master plan.
 
The task force, which typically meets on a biweekly schedule, has weekly meetings planned through early October. Those meetings are tentatively scheduled to focus on further review of the master plan and discussion of possible community benefits, including transportation and education. As decided at Monday’s meeting, certain members of the task force will help lead the discussion on certain categories of benefits.

Jameela Pedicini, a former manager for the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment initiative, will serve as Harvard Management Company’s first vice president for sustainable investing.
 
In her new role, the creation of which was announced in February, Pedicini will work to research and understand sustainability issues related to the University’s more than $30 billion endowment. She will be HMC’s primary liaison to the University on environmental, social, and governance and investor responsibility issues, and will offer staff support to the University’s Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility.
         
“As long-term investors we are acutely focused on factors that may impact the long-term sustainability of Harvard’s endowment portfolio,” Jane L. Mendillo, President and CEO of HMC, said in a press release Tuesday announcing Pedicini’s appointment. “Jameela will help strengthen our understanding of these risks and opportunities and will sharpen our due diligence process to ultimately allow us to enhance the long-term returns we deliver for the University.”
 
Pedicini most recently worked as an investment officer for global governance with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, where she implemented environmental, social, and governance integration initiatives, according to the press release.
 
Pedicini’s appointment follows an academic year marked by a push for socially responsible investment. Last November, 80.5 percent of College students who voted in the November Undergraduate Council presidential election supported a referendum advocating for the creation of a social choice fund; more than half the student body voted in that election. The University announced the next month that it planned to create a social choice fund.
 
In another student referendum in February, 93 percent of Harvard Kennedy School student voters supported a referendum to seed the social choice fund with money from the University endowment. Administrators have not indicated that they plan to take such a step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council approved a resolution Monday evening “condemning” Harvard Medical School’s decision to cut 31 custodial contract jobs, joining a chorus of voices urging the University to reconsider the move.
In June, the Medical School told American Cleaning Company, Inc., that it planned to cancel its long-standing contract with the company. The resultant layoffs of the Medical School’s 31 custodial workers contracted through the Brighton-based subcontractor were expected to take effect on Aug. 17, but they have since been delayed to September, according to the resolution.
The decision, which preserves the jobs of the additional approximately 60 workers employed directly by the Medical School, was made in an effort to reduce the school’s operating deficit, according to Richard M. Shea, the Medical School’s associate dean for campus planning and facilities. The move is expected to save the Medical School up to $1 million, according to the draft of a July 5 internal memo obtained by The Crimson outlining proposed changes to the custodial cleaning program in the wake of the terminations.
But at the City Council meeting, two people testified opposing the cuts, and the resolution questioned whether the cuts were needed at all.
“This cost-cutting measure is coming at the expense of the institution’s lowest-paid, least-protected workers,” states the resolution, which was introduced by Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr.  “It is not at all clear that Harvard has taken every conceivable measure to pare down expenses elsewhere in its budget before resorting to these terminations.”
Gina Vild, associate dean for communications and external relations at the Medical School, wrote in an email earlier this month that the custodial workers are not the Medical School’s lowest-paid workers.
The City Council’s response to the planned terminations follows criticism from Service Employees International Union Local 615, the labor union that represents both the Medical School’s custodial workers contracted through American Cleaning Company and those hired directly. Following Harvard’s notification last month about its plans, the union began soliciting signatures in a petition, both online and in paper form, expressing opposition to the cuts. As of Tuesday, the union had collected 282 electronic signatures and 300 written signatures, according to Victoria Jaffe, a spokesperson for the union.
Also at its meeting Monday evening, the City Council voted to request that the City Manager set up a committee “to open up truthful communication” with the University regarding its plans for its 2 Mount Auburn St. property. Harvard announced last fall that it intends to sell the property, which is home to a 94-unit affordable senior housing complex. The University entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Homeowners Rehab, Inc., in March, but no deal has been finalized.
