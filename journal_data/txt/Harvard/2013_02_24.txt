After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ll say what everyone’s been saying: Tarantino and Affleck got robbed. Both directors are more deserving than my choice of the nominees, Ang Lee for “Life of Pi,” but I’ll work with what I have.
Lee deserves to win for transforming Yann Martel’s overrated, heavy-handed novel into an impeccably crafted visual masterpiece. The obvious Oscar parallel here is James Cameron in 2009—neither “Avatar” nor “Life of Pi” have inherently compelling or original plots, which means that it is that much more important to engross the viewer with innovative images and effects. Cameron succeeded in bringing the planet Pandora to life on a grand scale, and the scenes from “Pi” on the Pacific Ocean are similarly awe-inspiring. Both movies are also two rare examples for which 3D enhanced the experience rather than detracting from it, and a lot of credit goes to the directors for that.
“Life of Pi” isn’t one of the year’s best movies, and it isn’t one of Lee’s best movies either. However, Lee had the trickiest task of any of this year’s nominees, and he pulled it off with pizzazz.

This category features both its youngest nominee ever—Quvenzhané Wallis, 9, for “Beasts of the Southern Wild”—and its oldest—Emmanuelle Riva, 85, for “Amour.” But different generations aside, the category is a smorgasbord of talents from some of 2012’s most interesting films.
It certainly seems a closer field than Best Actor, where critics have chalked up Daniel Day-Lewis since the first photos of him wearing Lincoln’s iconic beard appeared. Wallis’s turn as Hushpuppy was good, as was Naomi Watts’s bravely committed performance in “The Impossible,” but it seemed like both of them were ultimately subservient to the worlds the directors constructed—they didn’t command their respective films. Equally, while it was much praised, Jessica Chastain’s performance in “Zero Dark Thirty” lacked inner life—there was little sense of her character as a human being. Perhaps that helped the film overall, but it does her no favors here.
Between Riva’s performance and Jennifer Lawrence’s wonderful work in “Silver Linings Playbook” then, I would plump for the latter. Although Riva was extraordinarily courageous, and the luminous beauty of her “Hiroshima Mon Amour” days seems remarkably undimmed, Lawrence gave us a deeply complex creation by turns melancholy, defiant, and bursting unsentimentally with life. She deserves to win this prize. Also deserving of a mention is Marion Cotillard, arguably just as good, and shockingly passed over for the magisterial “Rust and Bone.”

If you think Anne Hathaway’s got this in the bag, think again. Sure, she shed about 25 pounds to play the tragic heroine in “Les Misérables,” and as everyone knows, the bigger the weight gain or loss, the better the Oscar chances. Yes, she shaved her head and let out a fountain of tears in her no-holds-barred performance of “I Dreamed A Dream.” And she is, admittedly, one of the few singers in “Les Mis” who doesn’t induce cringing.
Perhaps her melodramatic camera-hogging will bring home the gold. But that doesn’t mean it should. For all its apparent one-sidedness, this category actually has one of the strongest lineups of this year. Veteran Sally Field deftly gave us both sides of Lincoln’s first lady, Helen Hunt showed sensitivity—and more—as a sex surrogate in “The Sessions,” and Amy Adams once again demonstrated her adaptability as the icy wife in “The Master.” But hiding among these heavyweights is the truly deserving winner: the timid, loving mother in “Silver Linings Playbook.” As Dolores Solitano, Jacki Weaver both nails a Philly accent and portrays a mother holding a disintegrating family together with sheer resolve—not easy when that family includes a bipolar Bradley Cooper and an obsessive-compulsive Robert De Niro—all while whipping up the best crabby snacks and homemades a family could want.

Richard Brody recently published an eloquent and well-reasoned piece in his Front Row column in The New Yorker on Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or-winning and Oscar Best Picture-nominated film "Amour." In the article, Brody discussed its "sterility" and how the "smirking pleasure" exhibited by its filmmaker at the film's (spoiler alert) climactic murder scene made it feel "repellent." Haneke's game, as it always has been, is to make the audience complicit in whatever heinous act he chooses to depict onscreen, in this case the euthanasia of someone in extreme pain.
Brody is correct to identify this characteristic, which a lot of more positive reviews missed—or chose to ignore—but he confuses it for a weakness. More erroneous are those who have suggested that "Amour" represents Haneke softening, becoming more humanistic in his old age. Far from it—as Brody notes, his gaze is chillier and more grimly fixed than ever. This is evinced not only by the movie's rigid frames and lengthy takes—the camera never cuts away to spare us distress—but also by the film's representation of the dying process as the ultimate in body horror: pain, dementia, incontinence, and the foul stink of a decaying corpse.
The overwhelming sense in "Amour" is one of entrapment. The elderly Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) suffers a stroke and swiftly deteriorates in front of her husband's eyes. She's a spirit trapped in a collapsing body, and the sentimentalist view of the film might see Georges's (Jean-Louis Trintignant) eventual smothering of her as the ultimate act of that love for which the picture is titled. He releases her from this prison just as he, earlier in the film, releases a dove that wanders accidentally into their Parisian apartment.
But this is where Haneke muddies the waters. Georges is equally trapped—within the imprisoning walls of the apartment from which, with one exception at the beginning, the action never leaves. He has nightmares, the burden of caring for Anne becomes his only activity, and he starts to shut out acquaintances and friends—even the couple's daughter. Speaking at the Golden Globe Foreign Language Film Symposium on Jan. 12, Haneke described Trintignant as having "a secretiveness to him, a mystery." He's right—Georges's face gives no clues as to the true nature of his motives, and it lends that final killing an air of terrible ambiguity. Is Georges freeing his wife as much as he is freeing himself?
The viewer might find this idea unpalatable—indeed, perhaps they should find it unpalatable—but so it goes with a director who once claimed his aim was to "rape the viewer into independence." Our complicity with Georges, if Brody is right in identifying it, appears to suggest that Haneke has succeeded. Whether or not this is grounds to actually dislike the film or simply the issues it confronts is a matter of personal taste, but don't think for a second that Haneke has mediated his modus operandi or stark vision of the universe. Pushed to the edge of life as it is in "Amour," love, too, eventually perishes.

To fully disclose my bias, I felt emotionally castrated when the media rebranded “Zero Dark Thirty” from “highly anticipated Osama bin Laden movie” to “amoral cesspool.” The pain feels especially raw considering oddsmakers, all of the news outlets, and Harvard’s own Ben T. Zauzmer ’15 have gone into conclave to choose “Argo” as the name of the Academy’s first-born son (or 85th-born). However, it is truly “Zero Dark Thirty” that should storm the stage of the Kodak Theater, for Kathryn Bigelow has erected a thunderous, titanic monument to obsession: Jessica Chastain’s Maya, steely gazed and fully sprung, Athena-style, from the director’s vision. Jealous ex-husband James Cameron looks on.
If it ends in naught for “Argo,” then it will be “Lincoln” that succeeds; however, the distilling nature of the prediction system also ends in simplified damnation—“Django Unchained” is too controversial, “Les Misérables” is too corny, and “Zero Dark Thirty” could be renamed “Torture: Apply Directly to the Foreskin.” At 8:30 Sunday, it will be a funeral march for Tarantino’s Siegfried, empty chairs at empty tables for the “Argo” contingent as they thank the Academy onstage, and pursed lips for the Bigelow Squad. But even though the Best Picture win is pure politics, the nominees themselves all deserve your time—especially “Zero Dark Thirty.”

Despite its many virtues, it’s impossible to imagine Paul Thomas Anderson’s “The Master” succeeding without Joaquin Phoenix’s lead performance. Even Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln” doesn’t depend as much on its titular figure as “The Master” does on Phoenix’s  freddie Quell, a sex-obsessed alcoholic and war veteran. Indeed, the majority of the film is composed of his interactions with the religious leader Lancaster Dodd, played by a strikingly charismatic Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman deserves accolades for his work here, but the film is ultimately driven by Phoenix; though Anderson has admitted “The Master” was inspired by Scientology and the life of L. Ron Hubbard, his script is less concerned with providing transparent commentary than it is with examining how Quell reacts to Dodd and his promises.
All this means it’s left to Phoenix to show the audience how a troubled soul might approach the prospect of salvation. The answer is not spelled out in Anderson’s elusive, elliptical script; instead, the viewer will have to search for an answer in the way a sullen Phoenix erupts into sudden violence, in the way he hops onto a motorcycle and drives into the distance, in the way his lopsided face turns a sneer into a grimace. Phoenix has stated that he doesn’t care about the Oscars, and he shouldn’t. Even without the prize, this performance is an enduring testament to his singular talent.

In the Best Original Screenplay category, there are a number of exceptional screenplays, including the dark and gripping “flight,” scripted by John Gatins and the whimsical and unique homage to childhood that is  wes Anderson and Roman Coppola’s “Moonrise Kingdom.”
Yet the historical drama “Zero Dark Thirty,” penned by Mark Boal, which focuses on the operation to assassinate Osama Bin Laden, deserves to win the Oscar due to its terse, no-nonsense dialogue and its timely and critical look at the U.S. war on al-Qaeda. It is a film that leaves its audience with more questions than it answers. In doing so it becomes more than a source of entertainment, and instead evolves into a vehicle for social commentary.
Boal won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2010 for “The Hurt Locker,” and he has once again crafted a strong script.

The Best Adapted Screenplay award is always a challenging choice; on the one hand, the screenplay is the creative inspiration behind the movie. On the other, the screenplay is transformed as it goes from text to action, so much so that it can be difficult to distinguish the delivery of a talented actor or actress from the strength or weakness of the film’s written backbone.
The nominees for Best Adapted Screenplay run the gamut from the surreal adventure “Life of Pi,” written by David Magee, to the subversive romcom “Silver Linings Playbook,” adapted by director David O. Russell. Yet the winner should be “Lincoln,” adapted by Tony Kushner from Doris Kearns Goodwin’s political biography “A Team of Rivals.” Kushner’s script turns the dry and bureaucratic ratification of the 13th Amendment into a compelling and human drama, one which touches on grandeur but avoids an excess of moralizing and pomp. Kushner’s Lincoln is a figure the president rarely seems in history books—an uncertain, flawed, and deeply human man.

This category is stocked with Oscar familiars—four of them have previously taken home the Supporting Actor statue, while the fifth, Philip Seymour Hoffman, has but a Best Actor award to his name. They play more or less the character types for which they’ve been lauded, from Tommy Lee Jones’s stonefaced, softhearted senator in “Lincoln” to Alan Arkin’s droll geezer in “Argo.” But Robert De Niro’s turn in “Silver Linings Playbook” is exceptional—the veteran actor humanizes his gruff patriarchal role by inflecting it with a moving portrayal of mental illness.
Effecting an expertly cultivated volatility, De Niro controls all of his scenes. His character’s financial, familial, and obsessive-compulsive anxieties strain his expressions, and the tension this creates is captivating. The internal struggle of the Philadelphia Eagles-obsessed father he plays never lets up—De Niro’s always working, shakily holding together the football fan’s brashness and obsessive insecurities.
Also to his credit, he keeps aloft an aspect of the film otherwise dropped. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence’s storyline initially concerns their characters’ psychological instabilities, but then veers toward sports and romance; De Niro’s performance keeps the movie’s discussion of mental illness from feeling thin. It’s a worthy portrayal and one of the film’s best components.

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team outscored UMass in the final two frames and held even with the Minutemen in the first. But that was not enough to knock off the No. 5/7 team in the county.
A 4-0 surge in the second quarter propelled UMass (3-0) to an 8-6 victory in the Crimson’s season opener at Soldier’s Field Lacrosse/Soccer Stadium. Harvard (1-0) edged the Minutemen in the second half, 4-2, but could not close the gap.
“I thought we played very hard, tough, and physical lacrosse,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “Overall, I thought the effort was incredible. But the execution in the middle of the field and, at times, in the offensive end, wasn’t good enough to beat a great team.”
Harvard senior midfielder Alex White led all scorers with a hat trick.
“Al played really well all day,” Wojcik said. “He did a great job exploiting match-ups, [and] he did a great job generating really good shots.”
UMass jumped out to a 2-0 lead three minutes into the game with a pair of unassisted markers from Matt Whippen and Grant Whiteway. But strikes from White and senior attacker Jack Walker allowed the Crimson to draw even before the end of the first period. Harvard goaltender Harry Krieger made five of his game-high 13 shots in the opening frame.
“[Krieger] has really stepped up,” White said. “He’s bailed us out a lot, really kept us in that game. He’s been playing really well. Hopefully, he doesn’t have to bail us out every game. He’s a good player; it’s nice having that back there.”
The second quarter proved the difference as four different UMass scorers found the back of the net. Sean Cleary and Kyle Smith opened up the period’s scoring for the Minutemen with strikes less than a minute apart. Junior attacker Connor Mooney provided UMass a 6-2 lead with just over a minute left in the half. On the other end, UMass redshirt freshman Zachary Oliveri made three of his eight saves of the game.
“They really controlled the play in that second quarter. Their goalie made a few big stops and kind of stymied our momentum,” Wojcik said. “And they had great possession time. They capitalized on their chances, and we didn’t.”
Harvard challenged the Minutemen down the stretch as the Crimson defense limited UMass to only one goal per period in the second half. In the first minute of the third, Ryan Stevens skipped a shot between the legs of Oliveri.
“We had a really good scout on them,” White said. “I think our intensity and effort was there on defense, and we had a good plan.”
The squads traded punches as UMass’s Andrew Sokol responded a minute and a half later with a spinning shot at the top of the box, drawing a body check infraction from Robert Dunjvak in the process. But, shorthanded, the Crimson found the net 35 seconds later as White bounced another five-hole shot across the goal line.
“All I wanted to do was to kill the penalty so we could get back to even,” White said of his man-down strike. “But I looked in the middle of the field and the whole defense was kind of looking the other way.”
In the fourth, the Crimson drew within two goals off of a third, unassisted tally from White. Wippen scored his second goal of the match with 5:36 left in regulation to put the Minutemen up, 8-5, but Harvard countered 36 seconds later with a man-up goal from senior attacker Henry Mumford.
The Crimson managed only one more shot in the final five minutes of play as UMass dominated possession down the stretch. The Minutemen effectively navigated the newly-implemented stall rules, maximizing the 30-second shot clock and avoiding turnovers.
With just over a minute left, a push from Harvard captain Jason Gonos put the Crimson a man down, and UMass eased its way to victory.
“It was difficult for us to extend there once we were a man down,” Wojcik said. “So we were really chasing from there,”
UMass has now won 17 straight regular season games in a streak that dates back to April 2011.

In the final carnival of the season for nearly all members of the Harvard ski team, the Crimson submitted its fifth straight ninth-place finish out of 17 schools at the EISA Championships in Newry, Maine. Junior Rebecca Nadler, who took home Harvard skiing’s first ever individual NCAA title last winter, was the lone Crimson athlete to qualify for the this season’s national championships.
Harvard accrued 378.5 points on the weekend, well behind the University of Vermont’s top score of 939.5. The Catamounts not only overcame a first-day deficit to Dartmouth, but also completed a perfect season and won their third straight EISA title.
The Crimson was happy with its performances on both the alpine and Nordic sides, even if qualification for NCAA championships did not quite go according to plan.
“We had four athletes with a chance at making [Nordic] NCAA championships,” Harvard Nordic coach Chris City said. “Unfortunately, none of them made it, but they all skied some of their best races of the season this final weekend.”
On the first day, freshman Emily Hannah paced the Crimson with an 18th place finish in the 5K classic, and teammates Jennifer Rolfes and Alena Tofte also represented Harvard in the top 50 with 44th and 45th-place finishes, respectively.
Hannah again led the Crimson with a 13th-place finish in the 10K Freestyle MS out of a field of 72. Rolfes and freshman Annie Harvieux finished in 41st and 42nd place, separated by only four-tenths of a second.
In the Men’s 10K classic, junior Chris Stock raced to a 14th place finish, followed by sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci in 39th and senior Anthony Ryerson in 41st. Maifeld-Carucci also posted a 13th-place finish in the Men’s 15K Freestyle MS, and Ryerson joined him in the top 20. Stock finished in 32nd.
On the alpine side, Nadler led the way for Harvard. She took 13th place in the slalom on Sunday and tied Vermont’s Kate Ryley for first-place in the giant slalom, an event in which Nadler will look to repeat as national champion.
“When the conditions are so good, everybody can put down a fantastic run,” Harvard alpine coach Tim Mitchell said.  “So there were a lot of times that were stacked very tightly together,”
Mitchell also praised Nadler, who was the only Crimson skier, Nordic or alpine, to qualify for the NCAA Championships.
“It’s the time of year you want to be hitting your stride, and that’s what she’s been doing,” he said. “The result was not a surprise. You can see it in her skiing and training and now the results she’s making.”
Harvard’s Catherine Sheils, sophomore Liz Strong, and freshman Samantha Udolf also had top-50 finishes in both the slalom and the giant slalom.
For the men, freshman Simon Merryweather led the team in both events, finishing 33rd in the slalom and 49th in the giant slalom. Senior Andrew Spielvogel and junior Ian Anderson also finished both races; Spielvogel came in 52nd in the giant slalom and 46th in the slalom, and Anderson came in 41st in the slalom after finishing 60th in the giant slalom.
“It was a pretty solid overall performance—probably one of our better showings as a team,” Mitchell said. “I think people came a lot closer to executing on race day what they’d been working on in training…and I thought everybody’s second run, for the most part, was better than their first run, so they were able to make adjustments even throughout the day, which is always encouraging to see.”
Both Mitchell and City are encouraged by their team’s performance this weekend, especially given program’s youth and relative inexperience.
“As your college career progresses, you can improve your starting position based on your international ranking points and your previous year’s college performance,” Mitchell said. “Obviously as a freshman, it’s a bit of an uphill climb…. You can have a really great day and on the results sheet it doesn’t necessarily show up as much as their physical performance would have you believe.”
From here, both the alpine and Nordic squads—with the exception of Nadler, who will prepare for the NCAA championships—will focus on non-collegiate races before winding down their seasons.
“Most of our athletes will be doing a bunch of non-collegiate races to build their international ranking points,” Mitchell said. “Those will influence their start positions in college races [next year].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—It took Wesley Saunders one trip to New Haven as a starter to become national news.
The sophomore forward came out firing with eight points in the first 10 minutes of Saturday’s contest, but the highlight of his night came halfway through the first period. After coming down with an offensive board, Saunders received a pass on the perimeter and drove to the basket, beating sophomore guard Armani Cotton off the dribble and flying over sophomore forward Brandon Sherrod to put the ball home.
“That was sick,” sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi said. “It was unbelievable. I didn’t think at first he was going to dunk it, but he just went over the little one, and he dunked it.”
The dunk—slotted at number three on that evening’s SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays—accounted for two of Saunders’s 14 points in Harvard’s (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) win over Yale (11-16, 5-5) at Payne Whitney Gym, 72-66.
But after the dunk—Saunders’s second of the night—he slowed down. Despite accounting for more than a third of the Crimson’s first half points on five-of-five shooting from the paint, Saunders did not score in the final nine minutes of the period.
After failing to complete two consecutive three-point plays with nine minutes to play, Saunders was held scoreless until the start of the second half, when he hit a driving layup for his final two points of the game.
Although Saunders had scoreless stretches, he contributed on the boards and finished second on the team with five rebounds. The sophomore also chipped in four assists, finishing behind only freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who had seven.
INSIDE OUT
Sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith’s breakout weekend—34 points and 16 blocks against Penn and Princeton—earned him a starting spot, but it didn’t get him much farther.
Looking to make plays in the paint at the start of the game, the Crimson fed Smith down low on its first three possessions. After the center went one-of-three and allowed two layups from Yale’s leading scorer Matt Townsend in the first three minutes, Harvard looked elsewhere for offensive output but continued to play in the post.
The Crimson was held to only one three in the first half, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard’s first points of the night at the seven-minute mark.
But despite going one-of-seven from deep in the first period, the traditionally strong three-point shooting team—averaging 40 percent on the season—went to the line 14 times.
“There is no better offense that you can run than getting fouled all the time,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We will trade free throw opportunities for threes, and if we can get fouls from our opponent, it’s an easier shot from the foul line.”
Harvard kept to its tough inside game in the second half, and the free throws it earned were crucial down the stretch. Up by three with two minutes left, the Crimson added six points from the stripe—with leading scorer Moundou-Missi accounting for four.
After co-captain Christian Webster heated up from the arc and sunk three treys in the final 10 minutes, the Crimson finished the game with a 6-of-16 mark from deep.
MOUN-DON’T-MISSI
Coming off the bench five minutes in, Moundou-Missi was a force in the paint, leading Harvard with a season-high 17 points. The sophomore, who started the first five games of the season but was then sent to the bench after failing to put up big points, has earned more playing time as he develops as a threat on both ends.
Moundou-Missi added a team-high six rebounds—five on defense—and racked up only two fouls in a season-high 30 minutes of play. The forward ran into foul trouble last weekend, notching four personals in each game, but tonight his clean play allowed Amaker to leave him in down the stretch.
In an efficient display, Mondou-Missi shot six-of-seven from the field—including three dunks.
But perhaps more surprising was the sophomore’s performance from the stripe. Moundou-Missi went to the line six times and missed only once, hitting four key free throws in the final two minutes.
As the crowd became engaged down the stretch, Moundou-Missi credited his team with keeping its composure.
“It was a great game for us,” Moundou-Missi said. “Tonight was different it because it was a hostile environment. It was a good game, and I wouldn’t say it’s a statement, but it is a great win for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a nine-point halftime lead, the Harvard women’s basketball team let Yale tie up the score twice in the second half before capturing the victory, 69-66, Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Bulldog sophomore Sarah Halejian proved a tough opponent as the guard led all scorers with 29 points. In their last meeting, Harvard (15-8, 6-3 Ivy) was able to hold Halejian to just 10 points in a 67-54 win on the road.
“I think it’s a lack of discipline on defense,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said of her team’s inability to contain Halejian. “Staying down on her fakes. She has a certain move—they know the scout. They didn’t play the scout when they played her.”
This time out, Halejian went 12-of-15 from the field and hit all four attempts from deep.
“She’s a good player,” junior Christine Clark said. “I think we could have done a better job containing her drive and keeping her in front of us. We just have to learn as a team not to let a player do that to us.”
The Crimson was paced by the guard pair of co-captain Victoria Lippert and Clark, who combined for 39 points. Lippert, who chipped in a season-high 24 points in Friday’s victory against Brown, recorded 12 of her 19 points during a second half in which the Bulldogs (10-14, 5-5) netted 40 points.
Clark achieved her first double-double of the season with 20 points and 13 boards, both team-highs.
“It feels great,” Clark said. “Even more than [my statistics] it’s so good to be able to sweep Yale. This again is my first year ever sweeping Yale. I love staying undefeated at home. It’s just really great to build off of this from now on.”
Clark and Lippert were instrumental in the battle towards the end of the second frame when Yale knotted the score twice, first at 47-all and again at 54-all.
Five shots from beyond the arc propelled the Bulldogs’ second half efforts. Yale opened the frame with an 8-0 run that brought it within four.
Clark nailed four shots from the line and Lippert proved effective in the paint, with seven points of her own during the closing five minutes to seal the win.
“I’ll just do whatever it takes to win, so I was really glad that we were able to pull it out tonight,” Lippert said.
The Crimson jumped out to a quick start in the first half. Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle immediately grabbed a board off a missed jumper from classmate Ali Curtis and fed it back to the guard, who drilled a trey 21 seconds into the contest.
A jumper from Lippert and a pair of free throws by Fagbenle gave Harvard a 7-2 lead that it would never relinquish.
The Crimson squad extended its advantage to as many as 15 points with 2:32 on the clock in the opening stanza. Harvard remained aggressive on the glass, out-rebounding the Bulldogs as the team has done against almost every foe this season and converting 11 second-chance points in that opening half.
“Rebounding is super important,” Lippert said. “Being able to get second chance looks is what keeps our offense going. It’s definitely super important for getting those chances like that.”
In the game, the team topped Yale in rebounds, 45-27.
“I think we’ve been a really good rebounding team,” Delaney-Smith said. “I guess my expectations are that we will dominate the boards. Our shooting hasn’t been as good as it could be in my opinion, so offensive rebounding, especially against Yale because I don’t think they box out very well, was a point of emphasis for us.”
Harvard also outpaced Yale in turnovers, racking up 20 to its opponent’s nine, and gave up 22 points off the errors.
“It seems like that’s been a common problem for us this season,” Clark said. “I think we just need to come back hard to practice on Monday and keep working on it and keep working to improve.”
With the win, the Crimson remains undefeated at home this season.
“We toughed it out,” Delaney-Smith said. “We hit big shots. We hit big foul shots. We handled the pressure and we keep doing that every game. At some point we’re going to do it the easy way instead of the hard way."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looked as if the Harvard men’s hockey team (7-16-3, 4-13-2 ECAC) was going to continue a recent trend, continuing its momentum through the final games of the regular season after entering Friday night’s game against St. Lawrence (16-11-4, 9-6-4 ECAC) on a season-high four-game unbeaten streak.
Freshman forward Jimmy Vesey had put the Crimson up 2-1 early in third period at Appleton Arena on Friday, with assists from sophomore Colin Blackwell and assistant captain Alex Fallstrom.
But midway through the final frame, that lead would quickly disappear.
After a tripping penalty on captain Danny Biega at 7:57 in the third, Saint senior defenseman George Hughes netted a power-play goal to tie the score at two, with helpers from captain Kyle Flanagan and junior Justin Baker.
Just 12 seconds later, freshman forward Greg Carey claimed the lead for St. Lawrence, scoring what would be the game winner, assisted by Jeremy Wick and Jordan Dewey.
With the victory, the Saints increase their winning streak to four, highlighted by an upset one week ago against No. 1 Quinnipiac, where they handed the top-ranked Bobcats their first lost in 22 games.
Harvard remains in last place in the ECAC with the loss to second-place St. Lawrence. With three games remaining in the regular season, and the Crimson five points behind the nearest teams in the standings (Cornell and Colgate), Harvard will need some help to escape from its first last place finish in at least 50 years.
In the first period, the Crimson took the first lead of the game with a power-play goal from senior Marshall Everson, his fifth straight game with a goal, a career-high goal-streak. Biega and senior Luke Greiner earned the assists.
Around five minutes later at 11:20 in the period, Flanagan knotted the score at one with help from Pat Raley and Justin Bruckel.
Despite the loss, Harvard outshot St. Lawrence, 26-25, and junior goalie Raphael Girard had 21 saves on the night for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite missing junior co-captain Nick Madden to injury, the No. 15 Harvard men’s volleyball team continued its streak of dominance this week, earning its third and fourth consecutive straight-set victories over NJIT (3-10, 1-3 EIVA) and Rutgers-Newark (2-6, 0-4), respectively.
The Crimson (9-2, 5-1) entered the weekend fresh off of a historic victory last Friday over conference foe and then-No. 9 Penn State.
“I think it is easy to get on a big high after a big win like that and to lose focus and to look past some of your other opponents,” co-captain Rob Lothman said.
With Madden out, freshman Branden Clemens moved from his usual outside hitter position to right side attacker, and junior Michael Owen started at outside hitter.
“I think Branden stepped up and filled my position really well,” Madden said. “I think Michael Owen really stepped up too, because he had to fill Branden’s position.”
HARVARD 3, RUTGERS-NEWARK 0
After sweeping NJIT on Friday, Harvard carried its momentum into Saturday’s matchup at Rutgers-Newark.
“Saturday, we were primarily focused on our half of the court,” Lothman said. “We had done some scouting of Rutgers, so we felt pretty confident that we knew what they had to bring against us.”
Harvard was down, 14-11, in the third set before going on a 14-4 run to close out the match.
“We were able to keep the pressure on them late,” Lothman said. “When we got into those late game situations, we were able to score the points that mattered.”
Outstanding play by Clemens sparked the victory, which keeps Harvard just a half game behind the first place Nittany Lions in the EIVA. The freshman had 12 kills as part of an impressive .625 hitting percentage on the day. He also tallied three aces, three digs, and two blocks.
“On Saturday, [Branden] was definitely a major outlet,” Lothman said. “I felt really confident that anytime I threw the ball back, Branden would get the kill.”
Lothman handed out 20 assists and led the team in blocks with four. Sophomore hitter DJ White and sophomore blocker Caleb Zimmick each recorded eight kills. Harvard won the first set with ease, ending on a 9-3 run to take it, 25-15.
The second frame was close the entire way with nine ties in the set. To close out the stanza, Owen and White registered back-to-back kills to give the Crimson the set, 28-26.
“It was a touch-and-go match,” Lothman said. “We came out really strong early, and we won the first game by a pretty wide margin…. We didn’t play great defense, but I think the offense was clicking for the entire match.”
HARVARD 3, NJIT 0
The Crimson started the weekend’s road trip with a three-set victory over NJIT.
“We had lost to NJIT the last two years at their place,” Madden said. “I think we were pretty fired up going into the game, and it definitely showed.”
Harvard held a 22-18 lead late in the third set, but the Highlanders came back to tie it at 23-all. The Crimson responded well to the run, however, and took the next two points to take the third stanza, 25-23, and win the match.
“We had a little bit of a mental lapse [in the third set],” Lothman said. “Obviously you want to make sure your focus is maintained throughout the match, but it is good to know that we can come back and get the points that matter.”
Harvard opened the contest brightly, taking the first frame, 25-20, on a kill by White.
“Friday, we started the match strong,” Lothman said. “We didn’t play great defense, but we hit well enough that we were able to take that first game with a pretty commanding margin.”
Owen had two aces as part of a seven-point run in the middle of the second set, which the Crimson won convincingly, 25-14.
“We served pretty tough, and we passed really well,” Madden said. “Serving was our biggest strength that game, and we were ready to go.”
White, named the AVCA National Player of the Week for his performances last weekend, led Harvard’s attack again with nine kills and a .353 hitting percentage. Clemens trailed him closely with eight kills and a .455 hitting percentage, while Owen had six kills, three aces, and four digs.
“Two days in a row, we were able to come out and get the points that mattered and win both matches three to nothing,” Lothman said. “That is always good. That is always what you look to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a desperate attempt to break the deadlock, the No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team turned up the pressure, sustaining two possessions in the offensive zone in the last minute of overtime.  In the end it was not enough, as St. Lawrence forced the Crimson’s third tie of the season, 2-2.
After smacking conference opponents Brown and Colgate in a pair of 5-2 affairs, Harvard’s (20-5-3, 16-3-2) Friday night matchup against the Saints (17-12-5, 12-6-4) was much tighter.
“I think we are all disappointed tonight in a tie,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “But not disappointed in our effort. I think our kids played really hard.”
The game got off to a chippy start with five penalties committed in the first two periods. The first period was owned by the Crimson, while the visitors acted as the aggressors for most of the second.
The game eventually tightened up as a tense final 25 minutes saw few chances on either side before the game ended in a draw at the close of overtime.
Harvard came out strong, edging its opponents 12–2 in shots on net in the first. Four of those shots came from sophomore defenseman Sarah Edney.  One of which found the back of the net. The goal, which was credited to sophomore forward Hillary Crowe as it deflected off her stick, turned out to be the only puck to get past Carmen MacDonald in the opening frame.
The Crimson let its opponent back in the game in the second period, committing costly penalties and failing to account for skaters in front of the net.
St Lawrence’s Kelly Sabatine evened the score by wristing one into the back of the net from the faceoff circle during the side’s first power-play opportunity of the period.
Kayla Raniwsky put the Saints ahead, capitalizing on a puck that bounced to Maschmeyer’s weak side. The goal came on only the fifth shot directed on net for the night.
Several minutes later the puck found the back of the net again as two Harvard defenders collided and lost sight of it. Though the goal was eventually disallowed as it was slapped out of the air, it seemed as if a deflated Crimson side needed something to get them going.
That something came just minutes later as senior forward Kaitlin Spurling and sophomore forward Samantha Reber raced up the ice.
Spurling brought momentum back to the home side late in the second frame, directing a pass from the blue line past MacDonald. From there, Harvard kept firing, tallying the final six shots of the period.
“Reber made a great drop pass to me,” Spurling said. “I just got it quickly and rifled it toward the net.”
Multiple individual milestones were approached on Friday. Reber tallied a point for the third straight game, while Spurling’s three-game streak is one away from matching her career high. Over the last three games, Spurling has six points.
In the third, control swayed to Harvard, but co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey, who put six shots on net, could not seal the deal as the scoreless frame preceded an overtime period.
“We got ourselves in a little bit of a hole in the second period and got ourselves out of it,” Stone said. “But then we had tremendous momentum in the third period and in overtime.”
Scoring has been an issue for the Crimson of late. Though averaging just a shade over three and a half goals per game, Harvard has managed to surpass that number just twice in its last 11 contests. The Crimson outshot its opponents 37-17, Friday.
“I personally believe we need a greater sense of urgency getting to the net,” Stone said. “We get too fancy in those situations and we just got to ram it right down the middle.”
Several freshmen saw an increased role in the matchup, as Harvard switched things up with several lineup changes. Freshman forward Jessica Harvey saw more time on the power play, while her classmate Dylanne Crugnale was moved to the first line alongside Dempsey and junior forward Lyndsey Fry.
“I thought everybody that played really stepped up,” Stone said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A goal that snuck in right at the buzzer in the last second of the first period gave No. 6 Clarkson (26-8-0, 18-4-0 ECAC) a 2-0 lead and put it well on its way to a 3-1 victory over No. 5 Harvard (20-5-3, 16-3-2) Saturday at Bright Hockey Center. Down two, Crimson coach Katey Stone decided to make a change in front of net. Freshman Emerance Maschmeyer was pulled out of goal to let co-captain Laura Bellamy take over for the second and third periods.
“The first one she wasn’t ready.” Stone said. “It was an easy shot, [and] went right in, she didn’t track it well. When you’re already down 2-0 in the first period, and they score in that fashion with [two-tenths] of a second left on the clock, you have to make some changes. Lu came in and did a good job.”
The Golden Knights’ strongest performance came from junior goalie Erica Howe. Howe faced a very aggressive Harvard offensive attack, blocking 39 of Harvard’s 40 shots on net and keeping 86 Crimson shot attempts at bay. Having little time to spend in opposing ice, Clarkson’s offense took less than half as many shot attempts, tallying 38 attempts and putting 23 shots on goal.
But Clarkson managed to capitalize on its plays in the first period, while the Crimson struggled to do so. The two goals by junior forwards Carly Mercer and Vanessa Gagnon gave the Golden Knights the early lead they needed. Early in the first period, Mercer cut around sophomore Sarah Edney and netted a goal in the top left corner. Assisted by Danielle Skirrow, Gagnon capitalized on a wraparound that put the puck out in front, scoring in the last second of the period.
“We’ve got to get better at getting to the net and getting to the net for those rebounds, something we were doing a real good job of earlier [this season],” Stone said.
The second period brought a definitive change in pace for Harvard.
“When we gave up that goal late, we lost a little momentum,” Bellamy said. “We wanted to come out and move our feet and use our speed. That was our game plan from the start and we kind of got away from that in the first.”
The team outplayed the Golden Knights in the second period, firing 18 shots on net and allowing just four Clarkson attempts. The Crimson controlled the puck in Clarkson’s zone, and its efforts paid off when freshman forward Miye O’Dench scored the team’s only goal, with freshman Dylanne Crugnale tallying the assist. O’Dench put the puck right over the goaltender’s glove to net a goal in the top left corner.
Both teams struggled to capitalize on the power play with neither managing to capitalize. Clarkson successfully killed four Harvard penalties, while Harvard killed Clarkson’s five.
The third period brought the Crimson’s control to an end. Clarkson reclaimed its ability to get the puck to Harvard’s net, and junior forward Jamie Lee Rattray netted Clarkson’s final goal. Rattray rebounded a shot by Gagnon for the goal.
“We were getting our pockets picked a little bit tonight,” Bellamy said. “We cleaned up our game by the end, but by then to go down [makes] it tough to come back.”
The Crimson’s second loss to the Golden Knights this season locked it into the third seed for the upcoming ECAC tournament. The team plans to carry the loss as a learning experience as it approaches the tournament.
“We found some things out about our team today, and places we can get better,” Stone said.
The loss was followed by Harvard’s Senior Day activities which celebrated the Class of 2013, which includes a number of key conributors. Bellamy recovered the team’s defensive stability, making thirteen saves, and allowing only one goal while her co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey led the team in shots on net with six, matched only by junior forward Lyndsey Fry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there’s one thing that stood out about the John J. Lee Amphitheater at Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium Saturday night, it was probably the noise.
With 12:09 to play in the second half, Javier Duren knocked down a transition three-pointer to give the Bulldogs a three-point advantage, 49-46—his team’s largest lead since 6-3. He let out a scream, but it was drowned out by the roar of the Yale crowd. The voices only increased in volume after freshman point guard Siyani Chambers’ layup attempt was denied on the other end.
At some point in the next minute or so—after co-captain Laurent Rivard finished two free throws on a technical—there was a shot clock violation. Not your standard, last-second-shot-you-weren’t-able-to-get-off violation. Rather, the buzzer went off as co-captain Christian Webster received a pass from the opposite side of the backcourt; the rest seemed to be lost in the racket.
The Harvard men’s basketball team was eventually able to pull out the victory, 72-66, thanks in large part to a 17-point performance from sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi and double-digit scoring efforts from all four of the Crimson’s starting guards. But it didn’t come easily.
Both the game and the atmosphere seemed fitting for the oldest college sports rivalry in the nation—more so than the 30-point drubbing that transpired the last time Harvard ventured to New Haven. Perhaps more so, even, than the two teams’ contest at Lavietes Pavilion three weeks ago Friday, in which the Crimson nearly blew a sizable lead before coming away with a much-needed 67-64 win.
Before this Saturday’s game ended with a Moundou-Missi behind-the-back dribble as the clock ran out, prompting Duren to swiftly untuck his shirt in what looked like frustration, there was a minute or so of mayhem.
With 1:13 remaining and his team up four, Chambers drove in for a layup and was fouled by Duren in the paint—hard.
With the game momentarily on hold as the officials reviewed the play, various chants dissolved into a nervous murmur. And after what seemed like a long time, Chambers hit one of the two resulting free throws, pushing his team’s advantage back up to five.
Up 69-66 just 14 seconds later, Chambers worked the ball up the hardwood under full-court pressure and dished to Moundou-Missi under the basket with a threaded bounce pass. The sophomore was fouled on his layup attempt and converted on both free throws.
On Yale’s ensuing possession, Duren found himself all alone beyond the arc, but his shot bounced on the far side of the rim, rattled around, and fell out. Duren’s hands automatically found their way to his hips as each pair in the student section moved to a corresponding forehead.
On the inbound, Chambers pushed off of Duren, who fell to the ground, to receive the ball and was able to get it on the far side of the court, all alone. After killing a few of the game’s final 10 seconds off the clock, Duren bumped Chambers out of bounds. It’s a technical. Two Yale players physically blocked their coaching staff from storming further onto the court to confront the referees. And then, just like that, after one more Chambers make at the line, the game was over.
It’s hard to put a finger on the aspect of the contest that gave it a little something extra. Was it the opportunity to know off the Ivy League’s top dog with which the Bulldogs were endowed? Of the two teams with fewer than four losses heading into Saturday night’s contest, it was ‘one down, one to go’ for Yale after the Bulldogs dropped Princeton on Feb. 9.
Maybe it’s the age-old rivalry itself. As evidenced by the arrangement of the Ancient Eight banners in the rafters—they’re organized by the schools’ respective founding dates, rather than alphabetically—tradition puts Harvard and Yale in close contact with one another. It might even be the do-or-die in-conference situation for Yale’s team. After this weekend, a Princeton and/or Harvard league championship seems all but guaranteed.
Maybe it was sophomore Wesley Saunders’ Sportscenter-worthy slam in the 11th minute—one of three Harvard dunks on the night.
Whatever the ‘it’ factor may have been, those who tuned in, either in person or via CBS Sports, caught their fair share of excitement. The Game between Harvard and Yale football gets all the hype, but for one night in New Haven, men’s basketball reigned supreme.

The phrase "Kremlin on the Charles" may not be as outdated as you think.
According to Republican Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, Harvard Law School was more Red than Crimson as recently as 1995, when he graduated.
A spokeswoman for Cruz said that the Senator still stands behind comments he made in at a political rally on July 4, 2010, in which he accused the Harvard Law School faculty of having a stark communist bent. (These comments were recently brought to the fore by New Yorker writer Jane Mayer in the wake of what she called Senator Cruz's "prosecutorial style" of questioning Chuck Hagel, President Obama's nominee for Secretary of Defense.)
Cruz's spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, defended the senator's comments by telling The Blaze that, indeed, "the Harvard Law School faculty included numerous self-described proponents of 'critical legal studies'—a school of thought explicitly derived from Marxism—and they far outnumbered Republicans."
In his 2010 speech, Cruz said that President Barack Obama "would have made a perfect president of Harvard Law School" after he attacked Obama as "the most radical" President "ever to occupy the Oval Office."
Cruz also said that "there were twelve [Communists] who would say they were Marxists who believed in the Communists overthrowing the United States government."
Robb London, director of communications for the Law School, told the New Yorker, "We are puzzled by the Senator's assertions, as we are unaware of any basis for them."
This is certainly not the first time since the days of McCarthyism that Harvard has been accused of promoting communism and/or the overthrow of the United States as we know it. Last fall, Bloomberg News published an article that described Harvard as a training grounds for the world's most prominent Communist leaders.
It's unclear where Harvard stands on communism these days—after all, Cruz was here in the mid-90s, and the Bloomberg-exposed trainees have come and gone. But while we're not sure exactly what goes on north of Harvard Yard (or at the Kennedy School, for that matter) it does seem safe to say that things are fine for now. Although, if Barack Obama wanted to come back to campus, that could be cool. Obama for Board of Overseers in 2016? Let the accusations of a communist-run Harvard begin (again).
