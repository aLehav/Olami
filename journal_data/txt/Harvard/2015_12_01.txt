After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
[Chalotte sits hunched over her desk at 3:00 a.m., surrounded by empty bottles of Diet Coke. Her laptop gleams icily, and a cursor blinks upon an empty page. The situation seems hopeless—the book review’s due tomorrow, and yet our dear writer can muster up no coherent opinion on “IAPF54: Allegory of an Ornamental Hermit.” As she huffs in caffeinated despair, we zoom slowly into her forehead until Joy, Sadness, Disgust, and Anger become visible. Sadness—puffy, blue, turtlenecked—is spread-eagled across the control panel and staring at the ceiling. The other emotions hover behind her.]
SADNESS: Why is it so hard to make words, and why can’t humans hibernate like bears?
FEAR: We’re going to turn in the worst piece of writing ever written, and then Victoria will hate us and we’ll have to become an Ec concentrator!
JOY: Come on now, let’s focus. Can we say the book was…postmodern? That usually works, right?
DISGUST: No. You don’t know what that means. No one knows what that means.
JOY: Shh, it doesn’t matter. I’m pretty sure that one chapter about the possessed unicorn who learns how to speak Swahili was pretty postmodern. Okay, here we go…
[Joy shoves Sadness off the control board and pushes a couple buttons. Zoom out: Charlotte sits up straight and starts to type. A minute later, there’s a paragraph on her screen.]
DISGUST: Wait, why did we just compare the book to Vietnamese take-out noodles? Is that a good thing?
JOY: It’s creative! Because, like, the noodles are a little soggy but still salty and delicious, which is sort of how it felt to read the book.
DISGUST: The book was soggy? Seriously?
SADNESS: Ughhhh
ANGER: Screw it, we’re starting over!
JOY: Hang on—
[Before Joy can stop him, though, Anger leaps to the control panel—head aflame—and slams some buttons. Zoom out to Charlotte deleting everything while making unintelligible animal noises at her computer.]
JOY: Okay, okay. Let’s just all take a deep breath. First things first—did everyone like the book?
DISGUST: Didn’t make any sense. Ain’t nobody got time for that.
SADNESS: I liked it, sometimes…
JOY: Yes! Great! Which parts?
SADNESS: Well, it rained a lot.
JOY: (Sighs) Okay, less helpful. You know what, I thought the cover was nice. I’m going to put that in there.
[Joy presses some buttons, and Charlotte gets typing.]
JOY: Nailing it!
[Charlotte stops typing at 900 words and sends in the review.]
JOY: Job well done.
DISGUST: Eh.
ANGER: Can we write about Fifty Shades of Gray again?
[Charlotte passes out on top of her keyboard. End scene.]

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Japanese have a saying, “Ichi-go ichi-e,” which in English roughly translates as “one time, one meeting.” The idea is to behave as though every meeting or encounter were the last.
Now I’ve never been to Japan. But I know that even the people we see every day are never exactly the same each time. They change, we change; we can leave each other behind. “Ichi-go ichi-e” is also a manner of respecting this.
We can think of places as being like people too—Harvard and Boston, certainly, are haunted by many ghosts. On that note, here are five places which, as your outgoing Arts books exec, I invite my fellow Artslings to visit with me. None of these are sites I’ve been to before, and who knows when I’ll get to see them again? But no more philosophizing. Come! Let us go.
The Plough and Stars
A sprightly pub on Mass Ave, en route towards Central—named after a play by Sean O’Casey, the noted playwright, this bar was the namesake of the prominent literary magazine Ploughshares. In addition to O’Casey, David Mamet, Philip Roth, Seamus Heaney, Mark Sandman, Nobel Peace Prize-winner John Hume, and other such luminaries used to frequent it. Genuine Irish food, sweet whiskeys, live music. A sentimental journey beckons, and just a really good time.
Coolidge Corner Theater
This long-running establishment is a delightful Brookline sister to those other local indies: Kendall Square cinema by MIT, the Harvard Film Archives cinema, and that little empress of film houses, our Brattle Theatre. The Coolidge is especially well-regarded for its screenings of cult films like “The Room.” I was supposed to see “The Room” last year. Alan wanted us to go, on an Arts outing, but that plan fell through.
Museum of African American History
Last year I got lost walking around Beacon Hill, searching for this elusive institution. I was without any kind of GPS program, and had only a print-out Google Maps. There is the American Freedom Trail, as many know, but there is also the Black Heritage Trail, centered upon this place, offering a journey that is certainly no less American or free in spirit. This year they have an intriguing winter exhibition: “Freedom Rising: Reading, Writing, and Publishing Black Books.”
The Old Corner Bookstore
Was patronized by Alcott, Longfellow, Emerson, Beecher Stowe, and Dickens. In a time of so many upheavals, for the paper book industry as much as many others, this is one place that isn’t going anywhere… just kidding. Writing this piece, I’ve just learned that in 2013 it was converted into a Chipotle. They have retained a sign outside marking the building as a site on the Freedom Trail. Perhaps it will be worth visiting as a test of whether places are truly magical in themselves—whether, as the Japanese believe, the landscape lives. Whether there is something in the earth itself which abides continuously in one site, beneath the passing faces of its human dwellers.
The Boston Symphony Orchestra
Enough said.

Last year—as I entered my beautiful and harrowing journey as the Crimson’s music executive—I penned a piece about feeling middle-aged called “On How 20 is the New 40.” The article was an ironic listicle with the central conceit that all of the songs I presented as relevant to my condition were from Paul Simon’s seminal 1986 album-about-balding, “Graceland.” No one that I know of shared the article, but several of my friends said it made them happy/sad.
Now, 364 days and about 726 uses of the deliciously vague term “synth beats” later, I stand on the precipice of both alcoholic legality and the end of my Crimson executive career. And I still feel old. I’ve been wondering whether I’m feeling 41 or if my conceptual aging process is accelerating on base 10 exponential relationships. I have an inkling it’s the latter, because I feel even older than I thought I would. I reviewed my “Fundamentals of Precalculus” textbook from when I was 17 (and already feeling desperately aged) and found via logarithms (log(40)/log(20)) that I might be feeling 21^1.23 years old. Please do not question this math. Anyway, that makes me almost 44.
Since I’m about to take my first legal drink (hooraaay...), I decided to dig up some rad dranking shanties from my real-feel year of birth, somewhere in the 1971-1974 range depending on whether one uses exponents.
Elderberry Wine (Elton John, 1972) 
Bernie Taupin’s dope rhymes about divorce and alcoholism sound so upbeat in Elton’s silky baritenor that you wouldn’t even know the pain existed unless you hit MetroLyrics. Now I’m not even sure I’m going to go through with my initial b-day plan to set my fake IDs on fire at midnight and bounce over to Daedalus for a Bee’s Knees. Truly depressed.
Sea of Wine (Michael Chapman, 1973)
Chapman doesn’t define whether his spirit is elderberry-based (inconsiderate) but his sexy English twangst (twangy-angst) has me back on the ID-burn, mid-century cocktail scheme. And, in my humble opinion, Chapman is “floating home on a Sea of Fine,” if you catch my drift.
Poison Whiskey (Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1973)
I’m feeling a little paranoid after listening to this ditty about Ronnie Van Zandt’s dad, who I guess died from that spiked J. Walker Red. One non-alcoholic elderberry wine for me, Daedalus bartender!
Cold Gin (KISS, 1974) 
Rage-god Ace Frehley has been raging too hard in this legendary rager! You’re really getting “another quart” of Gordon’s, Ace? Damn. Damn. Also, I can’t tell if this song is about sex, but, if so, it’s disturbing at best.
Alcohol (The Kinks, 1971)
This messes up the chronology of my listicle, but “Alcohol” is so powerful that having anything after it would be cruel. "Oh demon alcohol / Sad memories I can’t recall,” Ray Davies paradoxically warbles. He also blames his habit on a “fanatical” wife, but however badly she’s treating him, the litany of liquors in the second verse has me thinking he brought this upon himself. If I’m keeping up this hypothetical “To Daedalus or Not to Daedalus” debate, The Kinks are the real kicker—I’m off the devil’s tears once and for all, and just in gosh-damn time.

As my younger brother would tell you, one of my favorite pastimes is giving sage advice when the market for said advice is weak or completely nonexistent. One of my other favorite pastimes is collecting quotes, a pursuit which I approach with the kind of passionate enthusiasm that normal people might devote to the accumulation of disposable income. So, combining life advice from someone totally unqualified to give it with quotes from various better-qualified someones, I’ve compiled a guide to writing in three easy steps.
“Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it—whole-heartedly—and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.” —Arthur Quiller-Couch
I personally believe this with all my heart. In fact, in the interest of efficiency, I usually take this one step further and avoid perpetrating any good writing to begin with. As a word of warning, I have found that professors, teaching fellows, and Crimson editors tend to be kill-your-darlings skeptics when I use this as a rationale for the total lack of “exceptionally fine writing” in the assignments I turn in. Philistines.
“An artist must be a reactionary. He has to stand out against the tenor of the age and not go flopping along; he must offer some little opposition.” —Evelyn Waugh
Now is your chance to indulge in all the irrelevant, outmoded, practically unreadable words you always wanted to use in your writing! Rescue them from their linguistic retirement home, where “eventide” is swapping tales of the good old days with “betwixt,” and “blithering” is looking for his false teeth. Why would you say “bearded” when you could say “barbigerous”? Or “the annoying habit of giving unwanted advice” when you could say “ultracrepidarianism”? Because the only person you’ve ever heard say these words is your great-aunt who also uses phrases like “doing a Google”? Bah. Evelyn Waugh said you could.
“There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.” ―W. Somerset Maugham
This is an excellent example of the kind of infuriating thing that you can say when you are a Famous Writer. Unfortunately, it provides little aid in your evolution from the bright-eyed aspirant whose dreams of learning from one of her literary heroes were just crushed to the literary hero who gets to crush these dreams. But it gives you something to look forward to during the long nights of typing in the kind of draughty garret or windowless basement you should inhabit if you are ever to be a Serious Writer. (If you possibly can, you should probably acquire consumption, too, or at the very least a severe cold.)
So there it is! A guide to writing better, from someone who you can tell by now is entirely unfit to write anything more nuanced and sophisticated than your average presidential campaign slogan or those romance novels that people buy in airports. And to this you, too, might aspire.
—Elizabeth C. Keto is the incoming Campus Arts exec. She would like to thank her fabulous predecessors/role-models-in-chief Ha D.H. Le ’17 and Victoria Lin ’17, to whom she is indebted for actually good advice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Maybe it was disinterest in theater on campus that incubated a culture of terrible write-ups and critiques. Or perhaps the disinterest in theater came from tragic, inexcusably contrived pieces of ‘journalism.’ Or maybe having well-articulated reviews concerning theater on campus is just too much to ask… Let’s focus on who we really should be reviewing: the reviewers.”
“The Harvard Theater Review Review,” running Oct. 23 to God-only-knows-when on Wordpress, is a moving yet ultimately lackluster demonstration of misguided frustration and adolescent angst. Directed by one or more disaffected thespians who take comfort from the fact that they, unlike other student writers, do not have to own their words with a byline, “Review Review” fails to live up to its initial promise. Although the show starts strong with a burst of pathos, it quickly trails off due to a lack of convincing performances and a seeming inability to stay on track.
At its heart, “Review Review” draws on themes recognizable to all Harvard students: an inexplicable sense of victimization, a self-centric view of the universe, and a penchant for complaining loudly that “Something must be done!” rather than actually doing something. Its opening lines, a powerful elegy to the coverage that the “Review Review” cast Deserves But Has Not Had Delivered Upon Them From On High, impressively manage to cover the entire spectrum of off-putting techniques of social attention-seeking, from self-pity to passive-aggressiveness to specious claims of harm.
Yet even here, the seeds of the flaws that ultimately doom the show are apparent. The writers acknowledge a campus-wide “disinterest in theater” multiple times within the first scene alone, yet the only possible explanation offered is “inexcusably contrived pieces of ‘journalism.’” Spare this theater editor her blushes, anonymous Internet commentators! Methinks you doth give the Theater section of the Crimson Arts board far too much credit. For if you truly believe that bright-eyed freshmen are arriving on campus, deeply passionate about the Arts and the Stage, picking up an issue of the Crimson in Annenberg, flipping to the Theater section with bated breath and sweaty palms, and then being tragically dissuaded from ever participating in or even viewing a Harvard theater production by coming across a horrific line such as “these production decisions combine… for a certain sterility,” I suggest that you re-read this sentence while laughing aloud and saying, “God, I’m an idiot and I also don’t know how to properly use an ellipsis.”
Unfortunately, the opening lines of “Review Review” pass all too quickly; the show soon hits its nadir, where it is still trapped at the moment of this writing. “But that was October 23rd!” you, dear reader, may be saying. “How can that be?” The answer is that publishing one blog post of 128 words, 32 of which were taken from others’ work, is hard. It’s exhausting. Who has time to do that, like, every week? Just imagine if the piece had been longer—for instance, 600 to 800 words—or if there were multiple pieces that needed to be worked on at a time! It would be a mess. Which is actually about the state in which “Review Review” ends up.
Before departing the stage with no foreseeable curtain call, though, the cast of “Review Review” leaves us with one final spark of irony. “Let’s focus on who we really should be reviewing: the reviewers,” they exhort. But in an awful bit of tautological reality, by reviewing the reviewers, they, too, have become reviewers. So, by their own logic, we were naturally impelled to review them as well. For now, until the “Review Review” Review Review monstrosity is born, consider “The Harvard Review Review” a bright but short-lived flash of petulance, a cry out in the generally apathetic wilderness, a mirage of unsullied belief in one’s own all-surpassing importance.

The Crimson Arts Board evaluates the top 10 films of 2015, as decided by our annual survey.
James Bond returns in cheery formulaic glory, ready to save the world from yet another nefarious organization. This time, though, director Sam Mendes strikes a new and successful balance between tonal registers: “Spectre” retains the sophistication of the most recent Bond movies while evoking the campy fun of the earlier classics. For every scene of angst, Mendes produces a pithy one-liner, a shot-down helicopter, or a conveniently-placed couch, and the result is a nicely pitched piece of entertainment. The acting remains good, too, which is to say that Daniel Craig still has piercing eyes and a perfectly chiseled jaw. —Charlotte L.R. Anrig
Remakes often feel unoriginal in their execution or too dismissive of their original source material, but Disney avoids such pitfalls with its live-action adaptation of “Cinderella.” Director Kenneth Branagh fills every frame with stunning visuals, and he is sincere in his exploration of the story’s deeper themes such as perseverance and growth. Strong performances from the cast, particularly Cate Blanchett in her role as stepmother Lady Tremaine, and a colorfully striking costume and set design only enhance the film. “Cinderella” might be a modern remake of a classic tale, but it manages to maintain the romantic charm and sentimental magic that made its predecessors so beloved. —Ha D.H. Le
The latest, and by critical consensus greatest, work to date by director Felix Gary Gray, "Straight Outta Compton" dramatizes rap band N.W.A.’s rise to success in the mid 1980s and 1990s. Gray depicts collaborating founders Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O’Shea Jackson, Jr), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) as quiet, raging heroes who battle not only for recognition as artists, but also against the injustice of the American police system—a timely topic. For such a contemporary subject—N.W.A. revolutionized modern music through their work in rap and hip-hop—the meditative camerawork imparts an unexpected sense of classical monumentality . “Straight Outta Compton” has fine actor performances all around, despite a conventional script. Beyond that, its dynamic, demanding, Byronic soundtrack is the real pièce de résistance. —Victoria Zhuang
Permeated by an omnipresent atmosphere of teenage malaise and supernatural dread, David Robert Mitchell’s modern-day masterpiece “It Follows” has already earned a rightful position alongside other canonical horror films such as “The Shining” and “The Exorcist.” Mitchell’s script simultaneously taps into and subverts classic tropes of adolescence: Protagonist Jay (Maika Monroe) struggles to define and reclaim her sexual agency throughout the movie while battling a relentless monster that haunts her as the result of a sex curse. A booming electronic score by Disasterpeace aptly complements Mitchell’s throwback ’80s visuals, and questions of spectrophilia are not the only ones left to the audience by film’s end. —Alan R. Xie
Director Alex Garland tackles man’s omnipresent fear of entities more intelligent than himself head-on with “Ex Machina”: the smart, chilling sci-fi answer to 2013’s more heartwarming and comedic “Her.” With rising Swedish star Alicia Vikander in the lead as the humanoid robot Ava, the film calls into question the same issues of sentience and autonomy for which Alan Turing laid the foundation with his famous eponymous test of artificial intelligence in 1950—a test that protagonist Caleb is dispatched to perform on Ava. “Ex Machina” is a Promethean tale for the modern generation. At its core a story of a man who dared to play both with fire and with God, it’s vague in all the right ways, never black or white in its morality but every shade of ambiguous grey in between. —Victoria Lin
Half a century after the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, “Selma,” directed by Ava DuVernay, retells the story of this crucial moment during Martin Luther King, Jr.’s leadership of the civil rights movement. David Oyelowo leads the cast with a powerful and convincing performance as King, and DuVernay brings to the screen both a sense of the march as a mass movement and compelling glimpses of the private struggles of its key protagonists. The film also offers a meaningful reflection on its medium and the power of images on screen—such as the televised footage of civil rights protestors facing violence from Alabama police—to appeal to the national conscience and promote social change. —Elizabeth C. Keto
From her critically acclaimed show “Inside Amy Schumer” to her HBO comedy special “Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo,” it’s safe to that Amy Schumer has established herself as a comic juggernaut this year. Her film “Trainwreck,” which she wrote and stars in, is no exception to her recent success. Directed by Judd Apatow, the film displays all of the hallmarks of a raunchy rom-com as Amy drunkenly, crassly, and hilariously hooks up with the men of New York while struggling to avoid romantically committing to surgeon Aaron (Bill Hader). Is the movie life-changing? No. But if you’re looking for a good laugh, look no further. —Abby L. Noyes
Many science fiction films are essentially fantasy with a palette swap, but “The Martian” returns to the genre’s more grounded roots. Building on a novel by Andy Weir, director Ridley Scott has put together a masterpiece of serious science fiction. Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, a botanist stranded on Mars, who survives by that most unlikely of things in modern science fiction: actual scientific knowledge. Damon’s acting is devoid of cheap tricks and histrionics. His performance is calm, believable, and stunningly relatable. He is also supported by an extensive all-star cast playing the rest of the NASA team, all of whom do a spectacular job portraying a set of characters that remain distinctive without becoming lifeless caricatures. There are no villains in “The Martian,” no easy screenwriting conventions. “The Martian” is the first—and hopefully not the last—movie to show us that Mars is a real place too. —J. Thomas Westbrook
Singlehandedly, “Mad Max: Fury Road” has redeemed the action genre. George Miller embraces the stereotypes of action films with his movie’s bizarrely souped-up vehicles, improbable physical feats, and stomach-churning camera maneuvers; simultaneously, he accomplishes feats of artistry in both visuals and storytelling. This is a film that functions on every conceivable level and can satisfy any craving: It is cinematographically stunning, unrelentingly engaging, narratively compelling, impeccably acted. And, perhaps most importantly, though a film in a traditionally male-focused genre continuing the tale of one of action’s most well-known men, it may in fact be one of the most feminist films of the past year. Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky takes a literal and metaphorical passenger seat to Charlize Theron’s fierce, compelling Imperator Furiosa, whose struggle to return to her female-dominated place of birth in a post-apocalyptic wasteland could easily sustain its own decade-spanning epic series. —Grace E. Huckins
Emotion and memory are two aspects of human existence that can be hard to capture on the big screen, especially without slipping into cliché. However, Disney Pixar’s “Inside Out” manages to brilliantly explore both, offering a deep examination of what it means to grow up without getting bogged down by its own subject matter. Led by an all-star cast that includes Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, and Mindy Kaling, among many others, the film expertly moves from moments of absolute hilarity to scenes of tear-rendering gravity. While it may have been marketed at a younger crowd, its story is ageless. —Abby L. Noyes

I didn’t want to write a vanity, so I made a program* to write my vanity for me. It took a lot longer than writing a good vanity probably would have, but I think I’ll break even after about 18 or so more vanities. I ripped a bunch of sentence fragments from Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi classic “Snow Crash” and fed them into the machine, and my program spit out a couple hundred sentences of prose: a chronicle of the Arts board’s daring exploits. It’s not particularly stirring or even that coherent, but that’s the computer’s fault, not mine.** I give to you: “Snow Crash Sad-Libs: Arts Board Edition: A Short Story in Two Parts.”
Part I
It's better to be conservative and take what you can get than take a big gamble and blow it; since then Grace has kept the gun in the glove compartment. The big stout Russian chicks—stomping, slab-faced babushkas—keep giving Kurlander a hassle. As he's turning away to protect himself, the middle third of the baseball bat turns into a column of burning sawdust accelerating in all directions like a bursting star; underneath is naught but billowing pale flesh. Abby ended up holding this bat handle with milky smoke pouring out the end, when they both wound up working at the Arts board. Lien turns away, shamed and awed. She will come away from the whole thing feeling that, somehow, she owes Victoria L. a favor.
Part II
Three times a day, they stomp the cigarettes out on the concrete with their cheap vinyl shoes. When they set down to pick up Jude D. Russo, it just seemed embarrassingly stupid. He has a little yard all to himself; he has no trouble finding the canal that leads to the next neighborhood. It will actually enhance their sense of duty if the thirty-minute deadline expires. Shaun just wants this over with; he belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. As he drags it backward towards Natalie T. Chang, she could hear nothing but singing and chanting. When they set down to pick up Mia, the babbling would spread throughout the van like a contagious disease.
Fin
Kenneth Goldsmith, who is pretty much a total hack, once tweeted: “Curation is as good as creation.” I don’t really find that true, but it lends a certain legitimacy to this randomly-generated pile of words, so I’m going to roll with it. Everything that can be made has already been made. Nihil sub sole novum. The Arts board is dead; long live the Arts board.
*If you’re interested in playing around with it, it can be found at https://github.com/adrianoiqbal/sadlibs/
**the obvious response to this is: write a better program. But I’m choosing to ignore that for now.

As a child, you loved Alvin & The Chipmunks. As a slightly less-discerning young adult, you loved Brian Borcherdt’s (of a very holy band) versions of old Chipmunks classics played at 16 RPM. Now, you might be wondering: What demented, ostensibly child-inspired music can I listen to next? Have I heard everything in this genre that there is?
Never fear! Miss Pussycat of Quintron & Miss Pussycat fame is here. The first couple of bizarre New Orleans noise, Quintron and Miss Pussycat have had long and storied careers of strange sonic experimentation. Quintron, the pioneer of swamp-tech, blends the sounds of the bayou with electronic exploration. Miss Pussycat, a puppeteer, has recorded far-out puppet skits under her name and with her band Flossie and the Unicorns. And so, without further ado:
Top Five Puppet Punk Albums, Ranked:
5. Miss Pussycat’s “Part of Two Puppet Shows” (7”):
This 7”, a classic of the form, comes wrapped in a gorgeously screen-printed denim sleeve. The A-side features beautifully dada-esque puppet noise—a puppet show without the pretense of narrative. This is puppetry at its purest and most elemental. Truly groundbreaking, innovative work. The B-side features a more classic comedy sketch—the Easter Bunny gets pulled over by police officers and asked to account for himself and his healthy supply of Easter grass.
4. Flossie and the Unicorns’ “The Animals’ Clubhouse”:
While Flossie and the Unicorns’ 2003 release is not quite as conceptually or musically strong as their outstanding 1998 record “L M N O P,” it is worth at least a quarter of a listen. Album highlights include “Magic Crystal Records,” which features specific and helpful instructions on how to start your own record label. D.I.Y. at its truest and finest.
3. Flossie and the Unicorns’ “L M N O P”:
The indubitable John Peel, described this album thusly: “The music sounds like furry animals playing dance music on little tiny guitars, incy-wincy drums and itty-bitty synthesizers.”
2. Miss Pussycat’s “Anthropomorphizer”:
Don’t fear the ferocious looking puppet on the album cover—“Anthropomorphizer” is almost sweetly nonsensical and piercingly high-pitched enough to entertain actual children or, at least, the young-at-heart!
1. Quintron and Miss Pussycat’s “Swamp Tech”
In lieu of reviewing this album, I’ll let some of its prescient, incisive, brilliant voice-of-our-times lyrics speak, essentially, for themselves.
I am a badass
He is a badass
She is a badass
You are a badass
Swamp buggy badass
—Amy J. Cohn is the incoming music exec and still loves Alvin & The Chipmunks

Given that I am as-of-yet only 20 years old, I have, of course, never touched a drop of alcohol—but I’ve also been an Arts exec for over one-seventh of my life, which certainly gives me the authority to speak on Arts-related topics. Based on my observations of my fellow Arts board members, then, here are my top five choices for beers to accompany an Arts meeting.
5. Bud Light
If there’s Bud Light at an Arts meeting, it must have been obtained, “borrowed,” or stolen from an inferior board. This vile swill has all the bitterness of a Jude D. Russo review and none of the insight. To partake of a drink so devoid of gustatory value is to demonstrate oneself of far too unrefined tastes for the Arts Board—unless, of course, there is no other alcoholic beverage in the immediate vicinity. Then it should by all means be consumed.
4. Yuengling
This American lager is a newcomer to the Arts board scene, but its low price—about $25 for a 24 pack at C’est Bon—makes it friendly for any unemployed Arts exec’s tight budget. Sure, it doesn’t have any discernible flavor notes or any obvious features at all, but it’s also not at all disgusting. It’s so benign, in fact, that it can be difficult to keep track of how many one has consumed, until the 24 pack is mysteriously empty...
3. Blue Moon
You’re buying for the whole board, you want to step it up a bit, and you’re short on cash. Fortunately, Blue Moon has identified and cornered the “relatively decent but not so expensive that you will refuse to buy it” niche. A Blue Moon Arts meeting is a good Arts meeting, and an exec who brings Blue Moon is comparatively munificent. Much like Goddess Lana Del Rey, Blue Moon certainly has its shortcomings and imperfections—but it so exceeds its environs in quality that it has made itself worthy of the kind of praise heaped on far superior products.
2. Smuttynose
The “Finestkind” IPA has a 91% on Beer Advocate, and it also has a cool, portmanteau-ish name like that Purity Ring song. It is therefore of High Quality and in line with Arts Pretensions. It has fruity notes—though I have no idea of what fruit—and it’s somewhat bitter, but in a pleasant way. Like coffee or something.
1. PBR
It’s not about taste. It’s about tradition.
—Grace E. Huckins is outgoing Arts hanger-on and incoming alcoholic rando.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson Arts board lauds the top 10 albums of 2015, based on our college-wide survey.
This year saw the release of “I Love You, Honeybear,” the second album recorded by Josh Tillman under the stage name Father John Misty. The former Fleet Foxes member takes on the odd mantle of maturity: The titular track is about love against a background of familial and global dysfunction; “Bored in the USA” examines adulthood’s difficulties in Recession-era America; “I Went to the Store One Day” is a paean to married life. The mixture of tongue-in-cheek and sincerity marks “Honeybear” as one of the subtlest albums of 2015 and sets a high standard for Tillman’s future work. —Jude D. Russo
With their second studio album “Caracal,” Disclosure continues to provide a unique blend of dance and pop. While at times the electronic beats feel conventional, the duo shines at key moments by creating orchestrations well-suited to their featured artists’ styles. “Magnets,” featuring the soulful vocals of Lorde, is mellow with jolting percussion and soft croons, while “Nocturnal” contains house beats and a dark melody that almost harkens back to the days of “Thriller”—a fitting musical companion to Jackson-esque The Weeknd, who provides vocals for the song. Through such tracks, “Caracal” proves to be an animated foray into electronica. —Ha D.H. Le
Not content to rest on past laurels, Tame Impala once again proves its mettle as a preeminent psych-rock act with July’s “Currents.” The album, the band’s third, represents a departure from Tame Impala’s former guitar-heavy style and its aesthetic of isolation and remove, but the group’s previous musical virtuosity is still present in full force. The quality of “Currents” is consistently high; even so, standouts include the funky-yet-menacing “The Less I Know the Better” as well as album opener “Let It Happen,” a throbbing, almost disco-esque number. Founder and frontman Kevin Parker’s high, faraway croon immerses the listener in the album’s carefully constructed soundscapes, which manage to be enveloping and atmospheric while still allowing the band’s genius for catchy riffs to show through. —Adriano O. Iqbal
Listening to Marina and the Diamonds’ new release, “Froot,” feels like wandering through a candy store. The album is full of sugary synths, jittery beats, and deliberately artificial, autotuned harmonies; each track is colorfully, slickly packaged, with Marina Diamandis’s haunting vocals overlaying it all. “Froot” and “Blue” are classic dancehall songs (“Give me one more night… Let’s do it one last time”), but Diamandis, the one-woman force behind Marina and the Diamonds, manages to lift even darker tracks such as “I’m A Ruin” into thumping, chrome-plated anthems with a distinctly La-Roux-like flair. And yet the record has an edge that belies its glossy-sweet finish; “Better Than That” begins, “You’re just another in a long line of men she’s screwed / just another in a long line of men she knew,” and “Savages” ruminates on the human capacity for violence. Quietly subversive, subtly thought-provoking, and overtly out for a good time, “Froot” is a night-out kind of record that is nevertheless utterly listenable anywhere, anytime. —Lien E. Le
Take clean, booming, and energetic beats. Add in a pinch of profound, emotional lyrics. Throw in a dash of spirited yet tender vocals. Mix all of these elements together, and the result is “Every Open Eye” by Chvrches, in which the synthpop group again asserts its ability to produce distinctive, infectious music. “Every Open Eye,” the band’s second studio album, strikes a sweet balance between the fun and the thoughtful, fluidly transitioning from the lively rhythm of the opener “Never Ending Circles” to the somber, yet hopeful, closing song “Afterglow.”  From start to finish, it’s a musical treat—a fitting addition to the acclaimed repertoire of the Scottish electronic band. —Ha D.H. Le
Though Sufjan Stevens’s newest album has been compared to 2004’s “Seven Swans” for the slow, minor melodies they have in common, “Carrie and Lowell” has a velvety richness perhaps better likened to beloved tracks such as “Futile Devices” (from “The Age of Adz”) and “John Wayne Gacy, Jr.” (from “Illinois”), with their sweet, resonant instrumentation. Stevens, known for his inventive and poignant lyrics, has outdone himself on “Carrie and Lowell”; he describes his own childhood—and particularly his relationship with his mother, Carrie—in verses both precious and conversational. Married with pinprick-specific references to “Casper the ghost,” “lemon yoghurt,” and a swimming teacher who called him “Subaru” are lines like “Fuck me, I’m falling apart” that are at once deeply personal and utterly universal. —Mia J.P. Gussen
On the title track of Alabama Shakes’s sophomore release, frontwoman Brittany Howard sings, a little wonderingly: “A new world hangs outside the window.” This might as well be a mission statement for the album, which updates the rootsy, retro Muscle Shoals-revivalism of their 2012 debut “Boys & Girls” with a brand-new, futuristic soundscape: a sort of progressive, psychedelic soul. There is a looser, more exploratory quality to this album, which features, among other tracks, a six and a half minute cosmic odyssey entitled “Gemini.” At the helm is Howard, with her virtuosic lead singing and guitar-playing—she has a wonderfully dynamic and expressive range: everything from an earthy visceral vitality to an eerie otherworldly falsetto—keeping things just this side of chaos. This sonic experimentation pays off powerfully: “Sound & Color” is an altogether weirder, wilder, and more wonderful release, an incredible follow-up to a very strong debut. —Amy J. Cohn
While “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” sounds eerily similar to a suicide note, Drake’s fourth album is a rousing reminder that the rapper’s career is far from dead. An amalgamation of delicate synths, technology-inspired sound effects, and foreboding harmonies, the surprise release is Drake’s darkest––and most exciting––work yet. Over seventeen tracks, the rapper displays unexpected thematic range, vacillating between unabashed self-promotion (“I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees”) to Kanye West takedowns (“I’m never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves”) to quiet contemplation with impressive ease. While “Late” lacks the radio-ready hits that peppered previous efforts, the album stands as a testament to Drake’s growth as an artist: Listening to the moving, breathtakingly honest “You & the 6,” it’s clear hip-hop’s favorite Canadian has come far from his debut days. —Shaun V. Gohel
Brooding lyrics and complexly layered instrumentals in “Beneath the Skin” are, at first glance, a stark departure from the hand-clapping choruses that marked Of Monsters and Men’s freshman effort. In this second album, co-lead singer Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir takes up the lion’s share of vocal duties, exuding wistfulness, melancholia, and painstaking introspection. The five-piece band (nine while on tour) has certainly demonstrated a willingness to probe deeper with their music—throughout this album’s valedictions and ballads and lamentations, their once-effervescent nature imagery now takes a backseat to songs dominated by dirge-like percussion. It’s only after a couple of repeat listens that “Beneath the Skin” starts to seem intimately familiar and warm after all. —Alan R. Xie
2015 was the year that Abel Tesfaye, or The Weeknd, rose from the ashes of his prior image as prodigal son of drugged-up indie R&B to become a veritable Top 40 tour de force. Tesfaye wormed his way into the public consciousness in late 2014 by way of the hypnotic Ariana Grande collab “Love Me Harder,” and he’s held his own ever since with his second studio full-length, “Beauty Behind the Madness.” Lead single (and according to Rolling Stone magazine, thinly veiled cocaine ode) “Can’t Feel My Face” excels as a standout among standouts, but the whole album is one finely tuned balancing act: just PBR&B enough to keep the hipsters interested, and just pop enough to keep everyone else listening. —Victoria Lin
The prodigious social significance of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton” is perhaps best exemplified by The Rockefeller Foundation’s willingness to subsidize tickets for 20,000 New York City public school students to attend the show. For many young people who see “Hamilton,” it may be the first time they have witnessed themselves represented on stage, on account of Miranda’s choice to cast a person of color in every named role (bar King George, of course). With an astonishing degree of historical accuracy, Miranda crafts parallels between the life of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton and the modern immigrant experience: In particular, his depiction of Hamilton’s downfall in the second half of the play illustrates with stunning poignancy the extent to which the deck is stacked against those born with disadvantage. When Leslie Odom Jr.’s Aaron Burr, with Tony-worthy emotion, realizes after his deadly duel with Hamilton that “the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me,” he encapsulates Miranda’s thesis: that immigrants have just as much potential as U.S.-born citizens to change the course of their country’s history. —Grace E. Huckins
Kendrick Lamar is the champion of the best trends in contemporary hip-hop. Glossy production and brilliant lyrics with content of ambitious scope mix explosively in this year’s “To Pimp a Butterfly,” an album that will be remembered as the landmark moment when Flying Lotus-style experimentation came together with West Coast-style spitting to take rap to a new level. Single “King Kunta” exemplifies this combination: With bumping rhythm, seamless Parliament samples, and flawless rhymes, Lamar weaves a complex commentary on black history and empowerment that is still a musical delight. —Jude D. Russo

Coruscating. Outré. Insouciant. Chrysostomatic. Sumptuous. Sublime.
These are all words I found in a thesaurus. What do they have to do with my breakfast? Probably a lot.
Consider the orange.
Imagine digging a solitary fingernail into the densely packed orange rind; slowly unraveling the paradigmatic peel with eager, trembling fingers; pulling a long, tenuous strand of fibrous shell around the circumference of the globe in a neverending loop; extracting the juicy, sensitive sphere from the tangled remains of its once-cohesive covering; carelessly dropping the now-unnecessary remnant of the peel, its protective duties now at an end, into an unsympathetic repository of cast-off matter and waste; returning one’s attention to the plump, naked fruit, artistically selecting a segment of the whole, now no longer whole, to pluck nimbly with dexterous thumb and arching forefinger; leaving the seed-bearing roundness suddenly hollow, empty and incomplete; raising the selected section up to the level of curious, penetrating vision; scrutinizing with fascinated gaze the glistening wetness oozing out from the meltingly tender piece which sparkles orange and gold in the rays of sunlight coruscating through the dust of the still morning air; inhaling briefly the smell of aromatic citrus wafting into the breathy passages of the nose; then dropping the succulent slice down from the exalted level of vision to the range of the predatory mouth; opening the entrance of that merciless cave, lined as it is with toothy stalactites and stalagmites; depositing the innocent sacrifice of pre-pubescent marmalade; exploring with tantalized tongue that soft, yielding bundle of gushing fluid; closing decidedly the crushing jaws down around that beautiful blossom in a delicate, sucking caress; and triumphantly tasting the explosion of sweet nectar swirling and spiraling unrestrained toward the throat.
But what a surprise! It’s a clementine, not an orange! What a brilliant subversion of expectations!
But rather than rest on his well-earned laurels from that stunning subversion, the breakfast’s auteur—a word I use here because I’m not allowed to use the first person in a review—took things still further. For alongside these tasty clementines was served, not milk, not coffee, not tea, not even water, but a glass of orange juice.
Imagine that! Orange and clementine mixing in the mouth! The line between the two begins to blur. Where does the orange end and the clementine begin? Probably at the glass that the orange juice is held in, except at one point when I spilled some of the juice on my shirt.
But the true intentionality of the meal only becomes clear when it is properly recontextualized in a big wooden chair sitting in the snowy mountains. Tropical fruit mingled with bitter cold? Bits of orange peel dropped in pure white snow? I don’t know what to make of all this, but it sounds profound, so I’m just going to leave it at that.
I will conclude with some words of wisdom that I heard my friend’s boyfriend who studies philosophy say one time when he was really drunk.
Deconstruction. Post-conceptual. Transcendental. Aesthetic. Sublimation.
—J. Thomas Westbrook is the incoming blog exec. Before breakfast, he was a deterministically caused being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 1, 2015 at 12:07 a.m.
Can’t you see? I’m hurting.
Last October, someone threatened over email to kill hundreds of Asian female students at Harvard. The series of messages sent to our college email addresses, promising to “shoot” and “kill” us individually—us “slit-eyes”—was unsettling, to say the least. I remember forwarding the email to my resident dean immediately upon receiving it, my fingers trembling. People assured us: It’s not a credible threat. But just in case, here are the active shooter safety recommendations, developed with guidance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Read about how to duck behind a door. Now move on.
I tried to move on. Yet just last week, more than a year later, the same person took advantage of Internet’s anonymity and messaged me in German. The content itself wasn’t threatening: “Kannst du deutlich sprechen?” or, “Can you speak clearly?” It felt like déjà vu. Fingers trembling again, I called HUPD. An officer came, wrote down the information, and stated that a detective might—just might—get in touch with me. Some friends showed their support, from liking my status on Facebook to sending me a quick text to talking to me in person. Others, not so much: Don’t worry, he’s just some lone wolf in Europe. You’re safe here.
I put on my mask, pretending that everything was truly okay. I went to class and even office hours that day, discussing abstraction in Albrecht Dürer’s “Knots” series as though I had no concerns besides academics.
This time, though, I came back to my room at the end of the day, and I broke down. Never mind the fact that he had singled me out, or that he knew I spoke German. Or, as somebody suggested, that he was insinuating that I couldn’t speak clearly because of my accent.
But as we all should know, this is far from the only racially charged event that has taken place at Harvard and its peer institutions in recent history. Black tape crossed out the faces of black professors at Harvard Law School. A fake final club punch stated “no fucking Jews. Colored OK.” Larry Summers supposedly questioned the academic standards of Cornel R. West '74, a former professor of African American Studies. These incidents are rampant throughout the rest of the country: how about that time swastikas were drawn on Yale’s Old Campus? Or when the members of Sigma Phi Epsilon and Alpha Phi at University of California, Los Angeles held a “Kanye West” party and wore blackface this past October?
When we get upset after any of these events, it’s never about the event itself. It’s about the culture of injustice in which these specific events are embedded. As an Asian woman, I face subtle or explicit forms of racism on a regular basis. Worse, I am expected to accept these incidents and put on a brave face. I will never forget what a white guy my age once told me: “You’re an Asian woman. You are at a disadvantage. You either suck it up and deal with it, or you can be a loser.” These words replay in my mind, nonstop. I can’t help but believe him. Whenever I’m hurt, I ignore my pain and force myself to forget it. I busy myself with writing my term papers, doing supplementary reading for a seminar, or working away at my thesis. I edit my fellowship applications. I can’t afford to be anything less than perfect when I’m already at a loss due to my race and gender. Even as I write this article, I wonder if I should instead be spending time doing homework. Worse yet, I worry that I sound too whiny.
A bus driver calls me an Orient? He doesn’t know better. A professor urges me to not be too polite despite my ethnic inclinations? She didn’t really mean that. My romantic interest tells me in a drunken haze that he likes Asian girls because he’s disenchanted by blonde bombshells? That’s a compliment. A friend says nonchalantly that he could easily break my fingers because they are tiny and Asian? That’s just a joke. Move on, I tell myself—don’t let it get to you.
The moment I am bothered by these statements, the moment I expend unnecessary time or energy, I become the loser.
But as I have learned, we all reach breaking points. This is mine.
This is my humble request: When we try to talk about our experiences or our pain, don’t dismiss us by saying that Erika Christakis’s email shouldn’t have triggered outrage, or that the message I received wasn’t threatening. Don’t label us as whiny, privileged Ivy League students. It’s already hard to talk about how vulnerable we feel when I’m supposed to be gleeful and grateful all the opportunities Harvard has to offer. When I finally decided to send my professors an email about what happened two weekends ago and how distraught I felt, I cannot tell you how many times I obsessively checked my email for their responses. Did I just affect my academic career? Will they think less of me? Do they care?
The more we hear that these discussions are “better had by people of color,” or that, as a white person, you couldn’t possibly understand where we are coming from, the more we harden our façades and hurt inside. It’s incredibly difficult and tiring to continue this conversation when we feel that our voices aren’t being heard. I become tempted to take my mom’s advice and “stop angering white people.”
Yes, the conversations are uncomfortable. We will both make mistakes and inevitably hurt each other in the process. But that’s the whole point. Neither of us will be on the winning side of the argument. Just because I may not understand your experiences doesn’t mean I won’t try to. If you feel that I invalidated your argument because you are white, that’s all the more reason for us to talk. Only through these challenging and tearful dialectical discussions can we move forward.
I understand that Harvard’s hands may be tied with my particular case, especially if it has been passed over to the German authorities. But it still distresses me that the person who wants to kill “slit-eye” students is messaging me “individually.” And it distresses me even more that behind my smile and my stacks of notes on Marcel Duchamp is a painful racial undertone telling me not to show any weakness.
Talk to me. Hear me out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week before Thanksgiving, Harvard College’s Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion released a long-awaited report assessing whether all of the College’s students “benefit equally” from Harvard’s educational and residential environment. The report represents a significant work of institutional introspection: Its overview of peer institutions’ policies on inclusion and its identification of ways in which Harvard currently fails to live up to its own aspirations make its specific short-term recommendations ripe for serious consideration. Perhaps even more crucial are the longer-term questions the report poses for future reforms of residential living, academic departments, and administrative offices. These structural ideas should serve as a basis for the College to address more deeply embedded issues surrounding identity and ensure the continued fulfillment of its promises of inclusion.
A particular strength of the report is its focus on practical changes that have the potential to immediately improve the College’s environment. One of the working group’s proposals, implemented last year, was the elimination of specific lines for Student Events Fund tickets, which had created a stigma around eligible students. Implementing more such ideas mentioned in the report would help to eliminate the “unnecessary markers of social distinction” that can interfere with building an inclusive community. The report’s immediate academic recommendations are similarly targeted. Clearer academic pathways for students from different backgrounds, better resources for underrepresented students, and a more intuitive listing of courses that directly address diversity are all relatively simple initiatives that would ensure that Harvard’s academic life is in concert with its institutional philosophy.
While immediate changes represent a key facet of the report, they must not overshadow the longer-term questions in the document’s final pages. These issues will provoke harder conversations, but represent an equally pressing area of attention. In residential life, housemasters must address what the report identifies as  “the lack of clear policies…and consistency across houses.” Academic departments must continually revisit the role of diversity in their fields and the ways in which hiring, mentoring, and advising may reinforce existing disparities. And administrators must investigate seriously the working group’s contention that the current structure of diversity and inclusion offices requires “streamlining” and reform. Moreover, the University must continue to discuss and revisit each of these issues moving forward.
The report, however, is not without flaws: Though understandably focused on racial and socioeconomic diversity, it should have done more to address issues surrounding gender identity, sexual orientation, and, particularly, ability. While the report mentions all these elements to varying degrees, more focus on specific areas of reform would have been welcome. This concern is especially germane for people with disabilities, given Harvard’s long-term challenges with accessibility.
Despite this issue, the Working Group’s report is a laudable call to action for all members of the University community. As the report quotes Harvard law professor Randall L. Kennedy, “Harvard, too, has been indelibly scarred by slavery, exclusion, segregation,
and other forms of racist oppression,” to say nothing of other kinds of oppression. Put simply, the Harvard bubble has never been closed off from the problems of the wider world. With an eye towards both the report’s long-term and short-term proposals, the current generation of Harvard students, faculty, and administrators can move our institution closer to the aspirational goals that to which its mission commits us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There may have never been something so ill-defined, yet so era-defining, as terrorism. Tangled among its debaters are two threads, one of the definition itself, and the other of its alleged misapplication.
Politically motivated violence that targets civilians may be the core of any satisfactory definition. But no sooner is a half-right theory of terrorism proposed than a crop of critics spring up to tear it on the grounds of praxis. This definition sweeps in a wide swath of criminal conduct, most of which never receives the proper label in popular discourse, and so it must be flawed.
All that abstraction for a simple observation we dance around: Why is it that “terrorism” is trotted out when the perpetrator of a crime is Muslim, and seemingly no time else?
The simplest answer might be that Muslims are more likely to commit sensational acts of terror, like the September 11 attacks, or the recent victimizations of Paris, and, indeed, this is the endpoint of reasoning for many of our Republican friends and a few avowed liberals. That, blended with a healthy amount of prejudice and political opportunism, breeds the ugly proposals of systematic registry, monitoring, and surveillance of American Muslims that the current crop of Republican presidential candidates has proffered.
The idea that the sins of Muslims reflect an inherent deficiency in Islam manifests itself in the bizarre insistence that moderate Muslims denounce each act of terrorism, lest their silence be taken for complicity. These calls continue no matter how many condemnatory press releases American-Muslim organizations might release. After all, their point lays in implying collective guilt, not grappling with the contradictions of reality.
Good-natured advocates, galled with this sort of historically recurrent prejudice, counter that Islam is a religion of peace, that the violence of extremists do not imply a moral darkness in all their coreligionists. Most of all they argue by way of analogy.
Look at the recent shooting at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs that killed three, they say, or the broader history of violence against abortion clinics and providers—where is the cry of terrorism there? Sometimes, their points get through: Just this Sunday, there was Mike Huckabee of all people decrying the Colorado shooting as a case of “domestic terrorism.”
And while I agree with the intentions of these counters, and even their content most of the time, I worry that this reaction to Islamophobia obscures needed debate on the most salient, supremely uncomfortable question:
Is there a relationship between Islam and terrorism?
You can’t quite answer yes. Yet you can’t quite answer no, no matter how much you (and I) want to.
There is, after all, an entire Islamic State that kidnaps, beheads, and terrorizes on the basis of the religion’s sacred texts. It produces glossy English-language propaganda magazines taking credit for the massacre of civilians and urging Western Muslims to join their fight by quoting the Qur’an.
The most tempting escape route is to say that this isn’t real Islam—and this is the central conflict we must grapple with.
There can be no definitive reading of Islam, no monopoly of interpretation that we may invoke to assert, once and for all, that it is the religion of peace we all wish it to be. Religion is whatever its practitioners make it out to be. Many religions were once dismissed as cults; many surviving sects began as dismissed and discounted interpretations. The longer this distorted, apocalyptic reading of Islam remains, the more followers it gathers and families it spawns under its rule, the more substance it gains. The shadow metastasizes into something horrifically real.
The Islamic State’s propagandists work night and day to justify their brutality to Muslims in the common tongue of religion. It is a war of ideas, for the sympathy and support of Sunnis. Debunking their claims about the interpretations of the Qur’an and the Sunnah will be essential to preventing the calcification of this ideology within the Islamic fold, a task that no Western country can provide legitimate aid for, and one that can only be handled by the credible scholars within the Sunni establishment.
We may debate endlessly about how to divide the fault for the Islamic State—and Islamic extremism generally—among the extreme repressive activities of governments in the Muslim world, Western support of those governments and the lingering legacy of colonialism, or even the symbolic collapse of religious authority after the dissolution of the caliphate.
But what cannot be debated is the increasingly common phenomenon of terror justified on the basis of Islam, a message that clearly attracts at least some within the Muslim community. Debunking the idiocy of opportunistic Islamophobes is important, but merely a symptom of a larger, festering malignancy. We can’t afford to ignore it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Loyal customers were shocked and saddened by the sudden closing on Sunday evening of Yenching restaurant, a Szechuan-style Chinese eatery that has been a staple of Harvard Square for decades.
A typed note taped on the store’s window read: “It has been a great pleasure serving you. Thank you not only for your patronage but also your friendship.” Workers inside the restaurant declined to comment further about why Yenching closed its doors.
The landmark Chinese restaurant has occupied the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Holyoke Street since its opening almost exactly 40 years ago on Nov. 26th, 1975.
Customers who frequented the restaurant expressed their disappointment at the news.
Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw said in an emailed statement that he would often take students there for lunch or dinner.
“I’ve been going to Yenching for decades,” Mankiw wrote. “I will miss the scrumptious kung pao chicken. But even more, I will miss the proprietors and their ever-reliable hospitality.”
William S. Xiao ’16 described himself as heartbroken about the closure of his favorite restaurant.
“It’s the restaurant I go to when I want food like it is at home,” he said. “It’s the one thing that’s been a constant in my four years at Harvard.”
Nathaniel B. Horwitz ’18 was likewise upset when he learned of Yenching’s closure.
“Yenching is a true gem of Harvard Square,” Horwitz said. “I’m devastated.”
Even students who attended Harvard when Yenching first opened recalled fond memories.
“It was such an important restaurant in my life,” Marina E. Grossi ’79 said. “Yenching was really popular amongst students when it first opened. Their lunchtime buffet offered interesting Chinese food, and it was relatively cheap.”
Even Yenching’s biggest fans, however, are starting to come to terms with the closure of their favorite dining spot.
“I guess it’s Spice Thai from here on out,” Horwitz said.

Colorado police arrested Yahya Hussein Ahmad Melhem, who was a librarian at Harvard Law School at the time of the incident, on felony charges for attempted child sexual assault on Nov. 20 after a sting operation involving a police officer posing as an underage girl.
Melhem is no longer employed at the Law School, according to Michelle Deakin, a spokesperson for the school. Melhem posted $10,000 bail and is due back in Colorado for a preliminary hearing on Dec. 22, according to Pam Russell, the communications director for the First Judicial District Attorney in Colorado.
Melhem, who was a librarian at the Islamic Law Center at the Law School, was in Colorado for a Middle Eastern Islamic Librarian conference, according to a police affidavit. While in Colorado, he allegedly began messaging an undercover police officer who was posing as an underage girl. His overtures became increasingly sexual in nature, and he allegedly sent sexually graphic messages over text and video messaging, according to the affidavit.
Gilpin County police arrested Melhem, 47, as he was driving to meet the police officer he believed was an underage girl, according to the affidavit. Police charged Melhem with criminal attempt sexual exploitation of a child, internet sexual exploitation of a child, internet luring of a child, and criminal attempt sexual assault on a child—all of which are felony charges.

The masters of Harvard’s undergraduate residential Houses are discussing changing their shared title—one that some students criticize as associated with slavery and Harvard College Dean and Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana says makes him personally uncomfortable. 
“As someone who is responsible for and co-leads one of the Houses…. I have not felt comfortable personally with the title,” Khurana said last week.
Some students—including a group of Latino undergraduates who issued a list of demands to administrators more than a week ago—have argued that Harvard should change the title, given the implications of the word “master.” Debates about the equivalent position have raged at Yale and led to a change of the title at Princeton.
Khurana said the House masters, faculty members who oversee Harvard’s 12 upperclassman residences, are “deeply aware” of the issues associated with the name and have been discussing the title for “a while.” The recent release of a report on diversity at the College, which called for a wide range of reforms to improve the experiences of minority students, has further sparked conversation on the subject.
While Khurana acknowledged that the “master” title can be interpreted in various ways—such as etymologically—he said he also takes into account “the social meaning of words.”
“I know that language is powerful, and I think we have to be very conscious about how language is used,” Khurana said.
Khurana is not alone in his discomfort with the title. Two House masters—Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten, who oversee Mather House—have gone so far as to ask others to call them something different. McDonald and Rosengarten updated Mather’s website sometime before last week so that it listed them as “chief executive officers” of the House. That descriptor has since been removed from the site.
Rosengarten said he feels uncomfortable with the formal House master title and signaled approval for the conversation about changing it. “It’s refreshing to have a discussion about these things because it is so important and shows the sensitivity of the people who have these positions,” Rosengarten said.

It remains unclear when, if at all, the “master” title will change officially, or to what. At Princeton, each residential college leader is now called a “head of the college.”
In an interview, Khurana alluded to the need to go through a formal administrative process for developing job descriptions and titles. He also said administrators are currently considering many recommendations made in the recent College diversity report, written by a committee led by Jonathan L. Walton, a professor at the Harvard Divinity School and the Pusey minister in Memorial Church.
While the diversity report did not directly call for a change to the House master title, it did emphasize the role House masters play in students’ minds as leading campus diversity efforts. Generally, it analyzed established institutional practices critically.
“Harvard College has a responsibility to promote a shared vocabulary among students around identity and difference, and to shift the optics of the campus from one that privileges particular histories and cultures to one that celebrates the diversity of the student body,” the report said.
The debate about the House master title is one of many ongoing conversations on college campuses about institutional names, especially those tied to now-controversial historical figures.
At Yale, in addition to the residential college master title, students have criticized the name of one student residence, titled after John C. Calhoun, a former U.S. vice president, white supremacist, and vocal proponent of slavery. A group of Princeton students, meanwhile, is demanding that the university change the name of a student residence and its public policy school to remove association with former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, given his record of racism.

Facing a group of expectant students in a campus lecture hall on Monday, Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow did her best to mollify students who have called on her to improve campus race relations, demands that intensified after a racially-charged incident shook the school two weeks ago.
As several hundred students crowded Milstein East Hall, just steps from where black tape was recently placed over the portraits of black professors in what some are calling a hate crime, Minow presented a series of proposals she hopes will make the school more diverse and welcoming for minority students.
“This is a time for serious challenge and serious action,” Minow said in prepared remarks. “It’s a time when we need your talents and commitments more than ever. I called this meeting to discuss efforts underway at Harvard Law School for changes inside the school and work to tackle the challenges in the world.”
Those include reconsidering the use of the school’s seal, which some students criticize because of its connection to a family that once owned slaves; changing it, according to Minow, would require the approval of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Minow said the school also hopes to increase faculty diversity, while Marcia L. Sells, the Law School’s new dean of students, said she plans to hire a staff member to focus on diversity and inclusion, another demand common among student activists.
But even as Minow and administrators outlined those and other efforts on Monday, they drew still more criticism from students, who have framed the recent vandalism incident as a symptom of broader racism at Harvard.
They had more grievances to air on Monday. Minow and her colleagues spoke for most of the hourlong meeting, which ran overtime, and at the end, several students stood up and said they were frustrated that they had not had more time to raise their own concerns about the environment at the school.
Deeming the meeting “an absolute joke” but also “an incredible moment” with so many affiliates of the school together, second-year Law School student Isaac Cameron took to a microphone and voiced a concern common among student speakers at the event.
“This was a moment for the campus to come together and discuss how Harvard Law School can deconstruct institutional racism, and we spent an hour where you spoke and we listened,” Cameron said. “I can’t think of a better metaphor that represents what’s wrong here on campus.”
Law School professor Dehlia I. Umunna also spoke at the end of the meeting, telling attendees that she had received an email with a racial slur as the subject line over the weekend. “For those folks who think that racism is not alive and well or that it’s exaggerated or contrived—it’s not,” she said. “If you want to I can show it to you. It happened just on Saturday.”
In an email to Law School affiliates following the meeting, Minow scheduled another forum for Friday, acknowledging that not all students had time to talk on Monday.
“At today’s community gathering, the time spent conveying initiatives underway and planned went longer than we anticipated and, regrettably, we ran out of time to hear from people in the community who wish to contribute to our ongoing conversation,” Minow wrote.
As Minow and other administrators continue take steps address student concerns about racism at the school, Law School affiliates and observers continue to debate the black tape incident and what it meant. In an opinion piece published in the New York Times last week, one of the professors whose portraits were targeted, Randall L. Kennedy, questioned whether the tape was in fact placed out of hatred.
“The identity and motives of the person or people behind the taping have not been determined,” he wrote.
At the meeting on Monday, Minow said she was thankful for a breadth of faculty input on the incident.
“In this diverse community, some people may read the defacement of the portraits differently, I have thanked faculty members for their thoughtful views and careful consideration,” Minow said.

Against the backdrop of the Paris climate change discussions, a crowd gathered at the Kennedy School on Monday night for an advanced screening of “Racing Extinction,” a documentary about species extinction by Academy-Award-winning director and National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos.
About 80 students, professors, and members of the public packed the Malkin Penthouse for the screening, which was hosted by the Belfer Center’s Environmental and Natural Resources Program.
“Racing Extinction” described the threat posed to endangered species in China, Indonesia, and Hong Kong by the combination of excessive hunting and climate change. According to the film, climate change has undermined and is continuing to erode the viability of ecosystems that have long supported a myriad of species.
As it elaborated on the supply-and-demand factors in the market for endangered species, the film juxtaposed images of medical practitioners using manta ray gills with images of rural Indonesian fishers who relied on poaching manta rays for their livelihood. The film also touched on the market forces incentivizing the excessive hunting of sharks and whales.
“It’s like we’re living in the age of dinosaurs, but we can do something about it [species extinction],” Psihoyos said in his voice-over in “Racing Extinction.”
Jennifer H. Lowell ’19, who attended the event, spoke of the imperative of environmental discussions.
“These are issues that matter for everyone,” she said, adding that the documentary shed light on “what we’re losing...to see what we will miss if we don’t do anything.”
Camille DeSisto ’19, who also attended the screening, echoed Lowell’s comments.
“It made me think about things in a different way,” DeSisto said. “I think everybody should see this movie.”

After almost eight years, Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth Ross will step down from their positions as Currier House masters at the end of the school year, looking to focus more on their research and professional pursuits.
Wrangham—who is a Human Evolutionary Biology professor—and Ross, assumed their roles as Currier House masters in 2008, succeeding Patricia O’Brien and Joseph L. Badaracco, who led the House for four years. Prior to their mastership, Wrangham served as an academic adviser in Currier; he also currently serves on the College’s Honor Council, a new student-faculty judicial body that hears cheating cases.
For Wrangham, the tightly-knit community in the Quad House is an aspect of the position he said he will miss greatly.
“It’s such a delight interacting with a wonderful community,” he said. “It was not until I became House master that I got some sense of the richness of students’ lives. Getting to know some of them has been a real delight.
Last spring, Wrangham was on sabbatical while still living in the House, leaving administrative duties to Ross as he worked on a book about human aggression. In a previous interview, Wrangham said he enjoyed having Currier as his home while he took the time off to focus on his academic work.
Sydney C. Karnovsky ’16, one of Currier’s House Committee chairs, praised Wrangham and Ross as instrumental in fostering a comfortable environment in the House.
“If I wasn’t graduating, I would definitely miss them,” Karnovsky said. “They’ve done a good job of getting to know everyone in the House.”
Karnovsky said Ross especially went to great lengths to engage with students, including hosting gingerbread baking events and attending every HoCo meeting. Karnovsky said Ross and Wrangham have been supportive and helpful in implementing various House initiatives.
“It’s clear that they really care,” she added. “Everyone respects them. Even people who don’t know them as well respect the job they do.”
“We’ve had just a fabulous time,” Wrangham said.

After coming away with a shutout in his first career start, sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen departed Hanover on Halloween donning a piece of his very own costume.
Madsen made 25 saves in the Harvard men’s hockey team’s season opener against Dartmouth—a performance his teammates deemed worthy of the Crimson’s player of the game hat, the centerpiece of a new tradition implemented by the team this season.
Three weeks later, the sophomore logged another performance worthy of headwear, making 60 saves over two games this weekend at the Shillelagh Tournament in South Bend, Ind. Madsen earned the Most Valuable Player award, as Harvard (6-1-1, 4-1-1 ECAC) secured the tournament title with wins over No. 18/- Notre Dame (6-4-4, 3-1-2 Hockey East) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (8-5-2, 4-0-2 ECAC).
But just ask Madsen: hardware does not guarantee you a hat.
“I think verbatim, [co-captain] Kyle Criscuolo, who had the hat from last game, said something about not wanting to hear one of my boring speeches again,” Madsen said.
Instead, sophomore forward Seb Lloyd received the honor from the Crimson co-captain and provided the post-tournament speech. Meanwhile, Madsen let his on-ice performance do the talking.
In the Crimson’s tournament opener against the Fighting Irish, Madsen allowed the game’s first goal midway through the first period but was perfect the rest of the way, making 29 saves en route to a 4-1 Harvard win.
The sophomore then stood on his head for the second day in a row on Saturday, shutting out RPI in the championship game. Madsen held the top team in the ECAC without a goal for the first time since the Engineers’ season opener, bringing their nine-game unbeaten streak to an abrupt halt.
“I thought Merrick was excellent,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought he was in control all weekend. He was calm in the net and made plays look simple. I think you can see his confidence growing.”
Madsen entered the year locked in a battle with freshman Michael Lackey, a left-handed netminder from Washington D.C. The two goaltenders have split time in net thus far this year, but Madsen now has received the nod from Donato in three straight games—all wins.
Prior to the Shillelagh Tournament, Madsen made a career-high 38 saves to shut out Princeton on Nov. 14 at Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. The start was Madsen’s first since the sophomore earned his second straight win over Dartmouth to open the year.
After the home-and-home against Dartmouth, Madsen gave way to Lackey, who manned the crease against the Crimson’s two highest ranked opponents to date—No. 12/9 Yale and No. 4/3 Quinnipiac. Lackey came 36 seconds from picking up a win over the Bulldogs, who delivered an equalizer in the final minute, before earning his first career victory the next day against Brown.
But on the road against the Bobcats the following weekend, Lackey surrendered three second-period goals in what amounted to Harvard’s only loss so far this year. Madsen has started all three games since.
“I’m still competing for a spot,” Madsen said. “You’ve got Michael Lackey—he’s a great goalie, and every week I’m going to have to work really hard in practice. There’s no off-weeks. We’ll just see how it goes.”
For all intents and purposes, the goaltending competition remains ongoing. But with a 0.60 goals against average and a 0.979 save percentage through five games—both NCAA bests, Madsen has emerged as the Crimson’s top option on paper.
Nonetheless, while Madsen has played well enough to earn the top spot on the depth chart, Donato has been known to employ timeshares in net. In four of the last six seasons, two different Crimson goaltenders have received at least 10 starts apiece.
“Both goalies have played really well,” said Criscuolo after the Crimson’s 3-0 Nov. 14 win over Princeton. “We’re confident with whoever’s back there.”
Harvard hits the road again next weekend for a Friday night bout with Union and a Saturday night rematch against RPI. With first place in the ECAC potentially on the line in the latter, Madsen is the early favorite to be between the pipes.
“I haven’t been playing perfect games by any means, and there’s things throughout the weeks and the rest of the year that I’m going to be continuing to work on,” Madsen said. “But obviously getting starts is what I’m looking for.”

The Harvard football team continued to impress even after season’s end, claiming 18 spots on the All-Ivy first and second teams.
Freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley and senior quarterback Scott Hosch were the big winners, with Shelton-Mosley taking home Ivy League Rookie of the Year and Hosch besting the competition to win the New England Player of the Year award.
Shelton-Mosley attained his honor through a unanimous vote by the eight Ivy League coaches. The freshman burst onto the scene in his first season, with highlights including a last second touchdown reception against Dartmouth and three touchdowns to help defeat Yale and clinch for the Crimson its third consecutive Ancient Eight title. He was also All-Ivy second team on offense and first team on special teams as a kick returner.
Hosch was chosen as the top player in New England by the New England Football Writers' Association. In 2015, Hosch set the Harvard single-season passing record by throwing for 2,827 yards, and he finished second all-time with 22 touchdown passes in a season. The quarterback finished his Harvard career with a 15-1 record.
The offense was led by a repeat unanimous first team selection in running back Paul Stanton, who rushed for 809 yards and nine touchdowns on the season. Joining Stanton as unanimous selections were senior offensive linemen Anthony Fabiano and Cole Toner, who with fellow senior All-Ivy first team offensive lineman Adam Redmond protected Hosch throughout the year.
Senior tight end Ben Braunecker was also a unanimous selection at his own position. In his last game against Yale, Braunecker caught six passes for 88 yards and two touchdowns.
Junior defensive back Sean Ahern was a unanimous first team selection in a season when he ranked first in the Ivy League and 13th in the nation with two blocked kicks. He was joined by senior linebacker Eric Medes, who finished the season with 59 tackles—the third highest on the team—and led with 6.0 tackles for a loss. Ahern will captain the Crimson next season.
Of the 27 players on the second team, nine hailed from Harvard, including senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer. Fischer’s 255 all-purpose yards in the team’s 42-7 win over Princeton capped off a productive four seasons in Cambridge.

There are two kinds of people in this world, the people who spent all their BoardPlus in the first two months of the semester, and freshmen. If you are a part of the latter group, or simply forgot until this late in the game that your HUID is a magical key that leads to a treasure trove of snacks, don’t fret– here are five easy steps to use up your BoardPlus by the end of the semester:
1) Stuff your microfridge for the long winter ahead.
Buy out the entire stock of Indian food in the Greenhouse Cafe, and store it in your fridge. You know you won’t have time to make your biweekly trip to Maharaja once exams start anyways, so you’re going to need that samosa when the times get rough.
2) Make someone’s day.
Venture into Lamont at any time between midnight and 2 a.m. and deliver a coffee from the Lamont cafe to a fatigued stranger. Note: the most pitiful students can be found skulking in the book inlets of Level B, muttering the words, “conference draft.”
3) Buy those overly expensive foods you’ve always wanted to buy. 
Sushi. Enough said.
4) Build a life-sized pastry statue of Dean Khurana.
Food can be used as a form of commemorative art. Improve the tourist photos by adding a Dean Khurana statue next to John Harvard. If you’re lucky, you might even make it on his Instagram.
5) Seize the business opportunity.
Buy the entire stock of CGIS Cafe using BoardPlus, and then resell the food to tourists at key locations around campus. For optimal results, set up a table at the foot of Widener steps and have Harvard students take small bites out of the food items prior to sale.

Here at Harvard, there are different sorts of texters. Whether you overuse emojis or semicolons, take the quiz below to find out which which type of texter you are.
Mostly A’s: Freshman
Everything is new and exciting, so your texts are filled with exclamation points and emojis. You check your phone constantly, hoping that someone will finally ask you to go to O Sushi with them.
Mostly B’s: Member of the Harvard Model Congress
Your texts are impeccable at all times (you wouldn’t want one misspelled word or misused punctuation sign to ruin your future political career). You prefer to use the old-school smiley-face emoji: classy and simple, it’s a safe bet. If you are in the middle of a conference, you may not answer your phone for three or four hours.
Mostly C’s: The Jock
You think the eggplant emoji is hilarious, but you only use it with the boys. Your response interval ranges from an hour to two, depending on whether you are at practice, playing Call of Duty, or writing a Hebrew Bible essay.
Mostly D’s: The Intense Pset-er
You are extremely efficient. In fact, you don’t even have time to use unnecessary emojis. You check your phone periodically, since you know that someone has probably texted you asking about question #3b or #6e.

Sometimes the dining hall has Swedish meatballs and cookie bars and the coffee ice cream and all is right with the world, and other times Harvard students don’t even have the now-classic chili and cornbread combo to fall back on. For the times when HUDS is a little more stingy with the edible options, Flyby has some suggestions to make your life a little brighter:

In case you’ve forgotten, each new class at Harvard brings a new crop of Facebook famous faces– you know, the folks you know not because you've met them at Annenberg but because you've read all of their Facebook posts the summer before Harvard. Flyby caught up with the formerly Facebook famous Wyatt Robertson ‘18, Gabby D. Aguirre ‘17, and Stephen A. Turban ‘17 to find out what they've been up to since their Facebook famous days and how fame has been treating them.
Flyby: Do you still post on the page? And if so, how much?
GDA: Not at all really, not unless I’m advertising for a job.
WR: Yes, I still post on the page a moderate amount. I think what made me Facebook famous, to use that term, last year was because I was on the First Year Social Committee and the UC, so I was posting a lot, just telling people what was happening, what was affecting their lives. Now I’m still on the UC and the College Events Board, so I’m still doing a lot of posting about events that are happening and how to make [people’s] lives more happy at Harvard. It really hasn't changed that much.
SAT: Not too often. I think there’s a tendency for people to live vicariously through the page. You're super excited about going to a new school; you want to show how excited you are; you want to meet new people— really the only outlet is the Facebook page and now, that’s not as much the case. I really just enjoy shouting in the dining halls now. I feel like that’s much more impactful.
Flyby: Are you sad that your class page has died down?
GA: Yeah, I am really sad. I really think that the Class of 2017 is great and they were always great to talk to, but I feel like everyone is kind of in their own little social group now and they don’t really see the need for using the 2017 page for anything but advertising.
SAT: Yeah I think so. I think that all my social capital is now gone. I am very lonely and desperate for social connection now.
Flyby: Would you say that your reputation on the page reflected yourself in real life?
GDA: On Facebook, I’m a lot nicer than I am in person. I guess more extroverted too. One of my roommates said, "I didn't trust you at first because on the Facebook page you were so nice. I don’t trust people who are nice.” I mean, I’m nice but I also have a sarcastic side too.
WR: I’d say it’s fairly representative.
SAT: I talked about how I got rejected from dates because I was a quasi-vegetarian. One of my applications for a seminar on eating healthy was on how that really limited my love life. And I still think that’s true—so yeah, it’s very representative.
Flyby: How have you changed since becoming Facebook famous?
GDA: It actually kind of made me reflect on my life choices. Last year I actually deactivated my Facebook for the academic year. I purged myself of it and it was really good. Now I’m back on, but I don’t post every day like I used to.
SAT: I think that I have developed rippling abs, type O blood, and 3% body fat. I’m also a Gemini now.
Flyby: How did your life change after Flyby published an article about you?
GDA: A lot of people used it to poke fun of me, “Oh you're famous now,” and I’m like, “Stop.” But besides that I've gotten a lot busier. I work a lot more and don’t have as much time for Facebook stuff as I used to. Also, I feel like I've acclimated a lot more. I love my house, which is Eliot, and I've gotten to know a lot of the people so I feel like I have more of a social life outside of social media. I think that’s good. It’s good to have a balance because a lot of people are down on social media and they're like, “Oh, you don’t see people face to face,” but I don’t think that that’s always necessarily a bad thing. It’s about finding the right balance and I think I have.
WR: I have started to be the designated person to post in the page for events. But no I don’t think I've changed that much. I’ve definitely been the butt of some jokes, but I think that’s about it. I think I’m the first person to laugh at myself about those kinds of things, so I don’t think my life has changed significantly.
SAT: I went back to being a Scorpio actually after that. One thing that did happen was that I got this email two months into freshman year titled Facebook Celebrities and it was from the dean of Ivy Yard. He had essentially assembled all the Facebook famous people into this meeting with the person who controls the Twitter account of Harvard. It was the most weird meeting ever; it was like just 4 kids giving suggestions on what to tweet about. It was bizarre.
Flyby: Do people still bring it up?
GDA: Not really. When you emailed me, I actually screenshotted the email and put it on my Facebook like, “Why is my fame haunting me?” Someone who's not even in my class was like, “Was it fun when you were a Facebook celebrity on the Class of 2017 page?" and I’m like, “How do you know this?” But besides that, no. If I don’t bring it up, no one else really does.
WR: People aren't talking about it that much. At the very least, people don’t make fun of me when I post on the Facebook group because it’s not a huge deal for me to post anymore. There’s that weird unspoken barrier about posting that’s never really been there for me.
SAT: I think sometimes people are like, “Did you post a lot on the class page?” “Is it you with the rippling abs?”
Flyby: Is there anything that you have learned?
WR: Tuesday at 9 p.m. is the ideal time to post. You get a lot of likes from that and it reaches a lot of people. The more you post it almost paradoxically gives you more credibility; not that you’re wasting your posts but that you're consistently informing people of stuff that will genuinely better their lives.
SAT: I think I did become a better short form writer actually. There’s a cadence to Facebook posts.
Oh, and Class of 2019 Facebook celebrities, we're coming for you too.

The advent of reading period means more than just late nights in Lamont and increased intake of caffeine– it’s also the start of gift giving season. Whether you’re looking for a gift for your roommate, a new friend from class, or partaking in entryway or house “Secret Snowflake”, it can be stressful to find something that’s both unique and student-budget conscious.
Behold, the Flyby Gift Guide (no assembly or trust funds required):
For the friend from warmer climates:We all have that one friend who lives in denial about the impending cold weather, no matter how many times the Starks have told them that “Winter is Coming”. Save your friend from their ignorance (and frostbite) with Harvard-branded winter gear such as gloves, hats, or scarves. They'll thank you when Cambridge treats us all to a winter that doesn't end until it's suddenly summer.
For the friend that’s already bought a ticket for the new Star Wars movie:You’ll score extra points with your friend that loves the franchise and is already preparing for the premier with the R2D2, Stormtrooper, and Darth Vader portable phone chargers at Urban Outfitters. The chargers are at the higher end of the budget at $25, so if you’re looking for something a little cheaper, check out the Star Wars playing cards at The Million Year Picnic or cool vintage ones on Amazon for around $10.
For the artist:The Bob Slate Stationery store has a selection of artist trading cards: sets of wallet-sized canvas, paper, and illustrator board sheets. At only $2.95, you could pick up a couple of Le Pen illustrator pens ($1.95 each) for a customizable, miniature art set.
For the eco-warrior:Help bring the great outdoors into your nature-loving friend’s dorm room with a mini terrarium from the Brattle Square Florist. A complete terrarium is about $15, but there is also wide range of succulents and cacti that are planted in cute individual pots. If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, give your friend an air plant; no soil is required for these cool organisms, making them perfect for a dorm room.
For the tea connoisseur:It can be intimidating to buy for this friend. Oolong, chai, rooibos, darjeeling? Skip the guessing and opt for the Almigh’Tea Bag from Black Ink on Brattle St. The reusable tea infuser comes in three colors, works with all leaf types, and is easily washable. Best of all, it’s only $7.50.
For the friend who’s still waiting on their Hogwarts letter:While this friend most likely wants a coveted ticket to eagerly awaited theater production, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, they’ll also be thrilled with the beautiful new illustrated Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone book. It’s available with Amazon Student for $22 (and free shipping!), but can also be found for a bit more at the Coop–just make sure to bring your student ID to get the discount.
Other gift ideas include T fare into the city for a day spent together at the New England Aquarium, the Museum of Fine Arts, or in the North End sampling cannoli from Mike’s, Modern Pastry, and Cafe Vittoria. Finally, check out the the $3 flash sales at Raven Books; there are often great classics as well as more unknown titles, which would make a perfect surprise for the bibliophile in your life.

Amidst Conversations on Race, House Masters Debate TitleThe masters of Harvard’s undergraduate residential Houses are discussing changing their shared title—one that some students criticize as associated with slavery and Harvard College Dean and Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana says makes him personally uncomfortable.
At Meeting, Law School Grapples With Race RelationsFacing a group of expectant students in a campus lecture hall on Monday, Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow did her best to mollify students who have called on her to improve campus race relations, demands that intensified after a racially-charged incident shook the school two weeks ago.
Currier Housemasters To Step Down After 8 YearsAfter almost eight years, Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth Ross will step down from their positions as Currier House Co-Masters at the end of the 2015-2016 academic year, looking to focus more on their research and professional pursuits.

Ha D.H. Le ’17 is an active Crimson editor and soon-to-be active Arts Chair. Because this Roving Reporter couldn’t come up with a better lede, she will plunge directly into an imagined conversation with current Arts execs on how Le juggles the 732 academic requirements she must fulfill as a biomedical engineering concentrator, the five-hour film screenings she attends weekly for her visual and environmental studies secondary, and the responsibilities of being a Campus Arts exec. (None of these topics will, in fact, be explored in the course of this article.)
Abby L. Noyes ’16, Arts Chair
Roving Reporter: Describe Ha as an alcoholic drink.
AN: The strawberry margarita from Border Café.
RR: Why?
AN: Because it seems sweet and kind of innocuous, so you go for a few rounds, and then a few more, and then the next thing you know you’re waking up on the floor underneath your booth sans pants, covered in pico de gallo, with a two hundred-dollar tab next to you.
RR: Are you speaking from personal experience?
AN: No comment.
Grace E. Huckins ’16, Arts Chair and active Rhodes Scholar
RR: As one of Harvard’s five newly crowned Rhodes Scholars, can you offer any insight into Ha’s future tenure as Arts chair? Preferably from the perspective of a Rhodes Scholar. Harvard has five, just so we’re clear. That’s more than any other school.
GH: What does the Rhodes Scholarship have to do with Ha?
RR: Nothing. The Crimson would just like to emphasize to its readers that Harvard has five Rhodes Scholars, the largest number from any one institution. Yale only has three. Suckers.
Lien E. Le ’17, theater exec and comp director
RR: So are you and Ha sisters?
LL: No.
RR: Cousins?
LL: No.
RR: Not even, like, the removed kind?
LL: No. Well, maybe. My uncle does always talk about the time someone offered him shrooms on the beach in Cancun...
Alan R. Xie, covers exec and comp director
RR: Which one of Ha’s covers is your favorite?
AX: Definitely the Boston Calling issue. I think it’s phenomenal that she managed to figure out anything that guy she interviewed was saying given the crappy phone reception and his indecipherable accent.
RR: Can you show us your best impression?
AX: I’m afraid I can’t—I lost my kilt, my ginger wig, and my list of Scottish stereotypes in the wash yesterday.
Shaun V. Gohel ’18, blog exec
RR: What are you more afraid of: Ha or “Don’t Look Under the Bed,” a horror film so traumatic that it marked the end of Disney’s involvement in the genre?
SG:  “Don’t Look Under the Bed”—duh. Ha’s, like, the opposite of scary, and that movie’s, like, the definition of scary. I still check under my bed for the Boogeyman sometimes. Isn’t that a leading question, by the way?
RR: So what if it is?
SG: I just thought you’d know better, since you’re a Campus Arts exec and all.
RR: You wanna go?
SG: I’m just asking, dude.
RR: I think the Arts blog su—
[AUDIO INDECIPHERABLE OVER HISSING AND YOWLING]
—Victoria Lin is the outgoing Campus Arts exec and incoming Arts Chair. She is the problem child in her partnership with her co-something and Best Friend Ha D.H. Le.
Sections
On Jun. 30, 1995, Victoria Lin ’17 was born. While that date is irrelevant for this piece, it serves as a poor lede into an article about Lin, an active Crimson Arts editor. This Roving Reporter imagines what the Arts board might say during Monday production night at 14 Plympton Street about the incoming Chair and whether she measures up to the film “Love.”
Grace E. Huckins ’16, Arts Chair
Roving Reporter: Victoria Lin—like PBR or like Yuengling?
GH: Oh definitely Yuengling. Yuengling is way classier, and Victoria is pretty classy.
RR: So if you don’t like PBR, why are PBR cans currently littered on the floor?
Huckins is unable to respond as “Guns and Ships” from the “Hamilton” soundtrack comes on and she starts rapping.
Abby L. Noyes ’16, Arts Chair
RR: Pugs or Victoria?
AN: Definitely pugs. Pugs are majestic.
RR: Victoria or Dean Dingman?
AN: Dean Dingman. Also majestic.
RR: Are you ever going to choose Victoria?
AN: Not when you stack her against pugs or Dean Dingman.
Jude D. Russo ’16, films exec
RR: Why are you wearing a mask of a gingerbread man?
JR: I found it in the Arts office.
RR: If you could save only one of these things, which would you save: Victoria or that mask?
JR: I’d like to say this off the record, but [REDACTED]
Victoria Zhuang ’16, books exec
RR: Could you describe Victoria in two words?
VZ: Fashionable and Ruffles.
RR: Ruffles?
VZ: She loves to eat them. She once finished a party-sized bag with her co-exec.
RR: Don’t you think that’s unhealthy?
Zhuang is unable to respond as she slips on one of the PBR cans littering the floor.
Tianxing V. Lan ’18, reporter
RR: How do you know Victoria?
TL: She’s my boss.
RR: How many stars would you give her?
TL: Three stars.
RR: Why three stars?
TL: Her fashion aesthetic possesses an eye-catching quality, but beyond the visual brilliance, she lacks the raw power of an auteur necessary for true works of art. For instance, she could have been more experimental with the plot that is her life, or she might completely abandon the idea of a consistent narrative.
RR: Have you ever given anything more than three stars?
TL: Yes, I gave four stars to Gaspar Noé’s “Love.” It was a beautifully crafted work of visual art.
RR: Really? I haven’t watched it.
TL: Noé provides stunningly intense graphics for not only the sex scenes that comprise over an hour of the film but also everything else.
RR: Wait, so you gave four stars to what is essentially a porno, but your boss only gets three stars?
TL: I have certain standards. I am an Arts writer.
—Ha D.H. Le is the outgoing Campus Arts exec and incoming Arts Chair. She would like to give her co-something Victoria Lin five stars and this vanity one star (mostly for effort).

It’s not everyday that one is able to witness a watershed moment in a classmate’s life. However, on Monday, November 30th, Flyby was given this rare opportunity.
Lamont Cafe had a quiet, early evening buzz. Aashay A. Sanghvi ‘19 approached the checkout-counter, unsuspecting. He handed his small white card over to the cashier, and was handed his snacks. Little did he know, however, that his innocent swipe also marked the end of his BoardPlus.
“My life will probably change,” he told us, as he stared at the $0.00 in disbelief. “Won’t have as many late nights in LamCaf.”
Despite the loss, Sanghvi has no regrets about Board Plus purchases: “I feel pretty good about my last one, not going to lie.” It was Poptarts and Oreos, two common snacks for Sanghvi. He said he spent about 90% of his Board Plus on Poptarts and Red Bull.
For Dylan H. Wong ‘19, the end was not as welcome. “I was at Elliot House Grill, and the mozzarella sticks maxed me out. I wouldn’t have minded, but today they were soggy. Not ideal, but I’ll move on.”
It’s not every student who can be so laid-back about the prospect of finishing their BoardPlus. Isabelle H. Jaffe ‘19 has $2.00 left, and she’s staying there. “I’m not ready to say goodbye to my Board Plus– I’m happy hovering near the edge.” If that’s not reason enough, finding an item that uses all but not more than her remaining $2 is also a challenge Jaffe is not up for.
While some students guard against the loss of their Board Plus, others are celebrating the beginning. Take Katherine V. Harrison ‘19, for example, who only discovered BoardPlus this week. “I felt like a fool when I found out BoardPlus did exist because I had used my [credit] card to buy mochas so many times,” Harrison explained.
Luckily, a friend enlightened Harrison of this rare Harvard bargain before it was too late. “Everyone else was doing it but I didn’t know. I was left out and I didn’t even know I was left out!”

The semester is almost over— but alas, it has not ended yet. Figuring that the Quadlings won’t be headed home from Widener and Lamont until past midnight given reading period and the impending doom that is finals, Flyby rode the late-night shuttle to and from the Quad for the latest edition of Overheard:
I get on the shuttle a little after midnight, and it’s pretty quiet. Most people seem silently absent-minded. There are maybe 10 people on board, and almost all of them are on their phones, on Facebook or texting— perfect cover for me, tapping away as I take note of who’s saying what. One girl seems to have reserved the seat next to her for her Frappucino as she scrolls through her newsfeed.
So far, not many people are talking at all. The only animated conversation is between two guys speaking a foreign language. There is scratchy chatter coming in over the driver’s radio.
Copy that.
Ooh, like an action movie, maybe. I didn’t know that shuttle drivers received orders.
That Steph Curry guy. What is up with him?
This seems like it might be a promising topic of discussion, but turns out just to be a sports radio show coming over the PA system.
I’m so tired. I kind of have a migraine and I don’t feel well.
Finally, a real conversation. This is a girl talking over the phone, though, so I’m only getting half of it. Get well soon— finals are coming.
It’s gonna be like a 15-minute walk. It’s not close, but it’s probably not worth driving.
The girl on her phone again. Is she talking about the distance to the Quad? I didn’t think anyone had the option of driving there.
At this point, we have arrived in the Quad. Most people get off, but two of my shuttle-mates are sticking with me for the ride back. Where could they be going? Are they riding the shuttle from Widener to Lamont? Can you get sexiled onto the Quad shuttle? I can’t decide.
The Ravens pick up the ball and run the other way for a touchdown. 
Although Flyby didn’t overhear any major gossip, perhaps we’ll have better luck next time on our Overheard. Stay tuned.
