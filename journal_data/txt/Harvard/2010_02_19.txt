After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University treats the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps like a final club: It refuses to recognize the program. Yet the military is preparing to lift its ban on homosexuals, the ostensible reason for ROTC’s exile. Is President Drew Faust practicing her salute? “There are not currently any plans to modify the arrangement,” John Longbrake, senior director of communications for the University, wrote in an e-mail. “We will of course follow any federal policy changes with interest.”
So will I. Even if Congress repeals “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” ROTC will struggle to gain recognition.
Why the skepticism? Because excuses for the University’s policy have multiplied over time. Before 1993, students used ROTC’s exclusion of disabled people, President Ronald Reagan’s budgetary cuts to civilian aid, and the military’s discouragement of “openness and critical inquiry” as grounds to repel ROTC. The Harvard Crimson argued that the program would sully the University’s academic integrity. In 1989, the editorial board insisted, “ROTC should not return ever, under any circumstances.” Should Congress abolish DADT, more excuses will crop up.
Not necessarily among students. Last spring, the Harvard Republican Club held an online poll in which 62 percent of the 1,700 undergraduates who responded supported recognition of ROTC.
Even the activists are laissez-faire. For example, the Student Labor Action Movement, which protested military recruitment on campus four years ago, has no plans to oppose ROTC. “The tentative consensus at the moment among our membership is that we will not protest the return of ROTC to Harvard’s campus, if President Obama ends ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’” Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11, a member of SLAM, wrote in an e-mail.
No, excuses are more likely to pop up among professors. Some of them “don’t view military training as academic,” Paul E. Mawn ’63, chairman of Advocates for ROTC, told me. “Some of the training I got when I was a midshipman was as tough and as challenging as any Harvard course I took. Marine engineering? You don’t get stuff like that anywhere else,” said Mawn, a retired Navy captain.
The faculty raised this objection in the 1970s: Warfare is a trade and thus irrelevant to liberal education. Stephen J. Chapman ’76, who as a student tried to reboot ROTC, told me, “Someone at the time asked me, ‘Would you allow someone to teach a course on welding?’ I said, ‘No but I don’t really think that’s the same thing.’ It struck me that you wanted military officers to get a liberal education but that wasn’t the common sentiment.”
Nor is it today. The best argument for ROTC is not that it complements liberal education but that it promotes public service. “Harvard is supposedly about public service,” Mawn said. “Never do they mention anything about the military in terms of public service.” Yes, President Faust attends the commissioning ceremony. But the University disrespects cadets by formally ignoring their service—particularly when it praises all other forms of service. Instead, the University awkwardly acknowledges ROTC’s existence but holds its applause, acting as if the program were “the crazy uncle in the attic,” said Mawn.
And for no good reason. To recognize ROTC would not be to violate the University’s policy against discrimination. Unlike final clubs, whose students restrict membership, ROTC excludes homosexuals because Congress says so. To recognize ROTC would merely be to honor it—no assembly required. “If a lightning bolt hit Drew Faust and the Corporation tomorrow and they decided to recognize ROTC, there’s not enough critical mass to form separate battalions…The Pentagon is not champing at the bit to have the administration get ROTC back on campus like it used to be,” Mawn said.
Despite my skepticism, the University seems headed toward recognition. The professors whom Mawn believes oppose ROTC are “remnants of what I would call the Woodstock generation. These people supported the Vietcong. They view themselves as veterans of the anti-war movement.” Although Mawn respects their right to express their opinion, he adds, “The light at the end of the tunnel is that those people will filter out.”
Until then, proponents of ROTC should stress Harvard’s dedication to public service to bolster their argument. They also should prepare for a long haul. Remember that the Crimson reported “some ROTC officials are confidently predicting that Harvard will have its own detachment again within six years.”
In 1981.

“Punch” is probably the most versatile word in the Harvard lexicon. It can function as a noun, a verb, or an adjective, taking different subjects, objects, and meanings depending on context. And in this linguistic flexibility lies one of the basic facts about punching: In order to punch, one must be punched first.
While fraternities and sororities across the country let anyone audition for a spot—as do Princeton’s posh eating clubs—at Harvard, even the selection processes are invite-only.
For generations, freshmen have been introduced to this idiosyncrasy within their first few weeks at school courtesy of the Hasty Pudding Club, a centuries-old social institution that claims five U.S. Presidents as members (one of whom suspiciously graduated Harvard decades before the club was founded). In late September, many first-years find themselves sitting on the sidelines while their roommates—often the ones who hail from New York or Greenwich—are whisked off to participate in a peculiar process with a funny name over at the Pudding’s 2 Garden Street clubhouse.
At least, until now. Early this February, the Hasty Pudding Club ebulliently announced to its members that it would be conducting an “open punch,” abandoning the invite requirement for the first event of its spring membership tryout.
While the move sounds like a bold departure from over 200 years of exclusive tradition, a couple of caveats are in order. This new, open process is not entirely new, nor is it entirely open. From 2001 until 2003, the Pudding was forced to conduct a truly open punch, complete with postering in the Yard, due to its brief stint as an official student organization subject to the College’s anti-discrimination policies. Those earlier efforts make the Pudding’s current project look restrictive by comparison. This spring, the club still punched over 100 students the old fashioned way—though each was told that he or she could bring along friends, creating something of a hybrid between openness and exclusivity.
Yet this time the club is not being forced to act against its will, and members appear enthusiastic about the new policy. “It’s a great move,” Punchmaster Sam O. French ’12 told me, adding that he was “a big fan of democracy.”
Open punch is the brainchild of Kate C. Harris ’10, the Pudding’s President, who stewarded the initiative past the institution’s undergraduate and graduate boards, finding surprisingly little resistance along the way. She speaks about her project with the conviction of someone who senses she is on the right side of history: “I think it’s an exciting change for the Pudding, and I hope it will lead to more exciting change on campus in general,” she professes optimistically. Harris envisions that open punch could spread to Harvard’s final clubs as well, eliminating at least one element of the exclusivity that isolates them from the rest of campus. Logistical constraints make many club members skeptical about the prospect of such change, but if it ever came about, it would meaningfully alter the composition of the clubs and the way they are perceived by outsiders—something worth getting excited about.
With these heady thoughts in mind, I went to the first event of the new era at the Pudding clubhouse last Wednesday night. Excitement may have been in the air, but if so, it was drowned out by awkwardness, as punches milled around sipping non-alcoholic beverages and making abortive attempts at small talk. The vast majority explained they had been expressly asked to attend—I was only able to find a handful who came as other punches’ plus-ones. When I inquired why so few unpunched guests showed up, one freshman volunteered that many probably felt uncomfortable because they weren’t officially invited.
The numbers support this theory. All told, the Pudding punched some 115 students this spring, who were joined by only 30 additional “non-punch” candidates. The process may have been open, but a full 80 percent of those considered for membership received an official invitation.
Yet there are signs that the new system wasn’t for nothing. According to Harris, around 10 of the 30 non-punches advanced to the next round, compared with about 40 of the 115 official invites—meaning both groups fared comparably well. It remains to be seen how many of the 10 surviving non-punches will actually make it in, but it doesn’t seem too farfetched that a few will eventually be invited to join the club.
The possibility that two or three freshmen who never got that first punch envelope might squeak into the Pudding doesn’t signify much for the rest of the campus in and of itself. But there’s more here than meets the eye.
On Aug. 27, 1783—13 years after the Pudding’s umbrella organization was founded—an aging Benjamin Franklin watched with wonder while the world’s first hot air balloon ascended into the sky above an enthralled crowd on the Champs de Mars in Paris. “But what good is it?” someone called out, to which Franklin famously replied: “What good is a newborn baby?”
So too might open punch’s fledgling flight ultimately turn into something greater—a chink in the calcified armor of social institutions far too opposed to change for their own good.

A few weeks ago, something strange happened to me—I turned 20 years old. Yes, I know it’s one of those boring birthdays between 18 and 21 (I’m still legal but still not legal enough to drink!), but it seems like two decades of life should mean something. After all, I’m no longer a teen, so I guess my angst-ridden days are far behind me. I used to think that coming to college was supposed to mark my transition into adulthood, but in many ways, it feels like this college has caused my transformation to inch along at an interminable pace.
When do girls finally become women and boys finally become men? As a child, I used to think of the teenage years as being the magic bridge to the land of “grown-ups.” Cultural coming-of-age rites, such Bar and Bat Mitzvah and quinceñera celebrations, occur at ages 13 and 15 respectively, and all the Disney princesses appear to get picked up by charming princes and whisked off to a castle by the time they hit 16.
In formal terminology, the distinction seems pretty clear. In high school, there were boys’ and girls’ sports teams and in college, they become men’s and women’s teams. Journalistic standards dictate that individuals over the age of 18 are always referred to as men and women. Harvard’s fight song is even called “10,000 Men of Harvard.”
Yet when I look around me in the dining hall, I definitely don’t see too many “men” present, and when I walk past the Women’s Center, I’m not sure the label is referring to me. For my male peers, there is the convenient label of “guy,” a term that is delightfully versatile enough to span the gap between boy and man and yet narrow enough to distinguish final club members from say, a tenured professor. There doesn’t seem to be a truly equivalent term for females—people are going to throw you odd looks if you constantly refer them as “gals.” Feminists in the 70s fought for the right to be called “women” instead of “girls” in acknowledgement of their status as independent, confident adults. But now the term “woman” is so loaded with age connotations that when a friend recently told me he was “seeing a woman,” I thought he meant he was having an affair with someone at least 10 years older, maybe even married.
As this labeling confusion indicates, the question of when adulthood begins is unsettled across culture. Plenty of writers today have waxed eloquent about the trend of twenty-somethings that spend years in a sheltered limbo between adolescence and adulthood—a 2005 Times article called them “twixters.” People are settling down later, having children later, and it seems we can wait as long as we want to grow up. We are the product of society in which, perhaps more than ever before, age is really just a number. Independence and responsibility, the things that American society tends to associate with adulthood, are embraced by different people at different times.
And in choosing to attend Harvard, we have all implicitly made that decision to put adult life on hold. Most of my high school classmates at other universities now live in apartments and pay their own bills. Explaining my own living situation comes off a little humorous at times; well, I live in a House—no, not like a sorority house—like, um, the Houses in Harry Potter. Without having to worry about grocery shopping or dividing up rent, Harvard students are able to devote almost all their energy to their academics and extracurriculars. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the ability to incorporate Hegel and Foucault references into cocktail conversations and juggle 10 activities at a time doesn’t make you any more mature than your were in high school. Elite liberal arts colleges like this one produce intellectually sophisticated and highly accomplished individuals, but many of us won’t be able to consider ourselves full adults until well after graduation.
Maybe one day I will wake, look myself in the mirror, and finally be able to call myself a “woman” without laughing about it. But until then, here’s to being a 20-year-old girl.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Joe Lieberman is a far cry from the model politician. In addition to his past political eccentricities, his recent threat to help Republicans block key parts of the federal health-care legislation has angered more than a few people, including the notorious left-wing documentary director Michael Moore. Never one to sit on the sidelines when there’s a statement to be made, Moore has called upon his loyal fans to boycott all Connecticut businesses and institutions until Senator Lieberman comes to his (theoretical) senses. Moore’s plan is not only ill-conceived but also harmful, and harmful to the wrong people. Connecticut business owners have enough troubles in light of this recession, and they don’t need a political stunt to kick them when they’re down.
In addition, this move assumes that Liebermann is one to act rationally, or to care about his popularity in the first place. This may not be the case, since Lieberman is even now opposing reforms that he once avidly purported. In the 2000 presidential race, the then-vice presidential candidate supported the bi-partisan expansion of Medicare. He ran on the same platform again in his 2004 presidential bid. His past health-care reform proposals have ostracized both sides of the aisle, effectively killing his popularity. These proposals included such radical ideas as automatic health-coverage for all American children up to the age of 25 in a program called MediKids, lower prescription prices for seniors, importing prescription drugs from Canada, and allowing patients the right to sue HMOs. These recent threats to shoot down the health care proposals come notwithstanding the fact that Liebermann, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, to date has received over $930,000 in campaign contributions from professionals in the health care and medical sectors.
Thus, Lieberman has proved himself unreliable at best and an easily bought-out political tool at worst. And Moore’s fan base, while undoubtedly loyal, may not be loyal enough to dent the Senator’s resolve. A better solution, perhaps, would be for the people of Connecticut to boycott Senator Liebermann in the next election.

While most of their teammates are relaxing during the offseason, 40 National Football League players spent this week at the Harvard Business School participating in the Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program.
The workshop, which is part of HBS’s Executive Education program, aims to prepare players for life after football by instilling a better understanding of the business world.
The course, which is open to current players and retirees, has become increasingly popular since its inception six years ago.
The players participating in  this year’s program include Dallas D. Clark and Anthony E. Gonzalez of the Indianapolis Colts; Jason P. Taylor of the Miami Dolphins; Patrick W. Kearney, John D. Carlson, and Olindo F. Mare of the Seattle Seahawks; and Brandon Moore of the New York Jets. The Seahawks and Colts are the most heavily represented teams, with four players each.
“As you play in the League for a few years, you start realizing that this isn’t forever,” Clark said. “I think that’s the biggest fear for the majority of NFL players.”
The program’s classes, which employ the Business School’s case method teaching style, provide participants with a foundation in topics such as management, negotiation, entrepreneurship, legal issues, and business plan analysis.
Both Morten Andersen, a retired record-holding kicker, and Jamie Silva, a second-year Colts safety, said they enjoyed the case study aspect of the program.
“There’s not a real wrong answer or a right answer—it’s focused more on your own opinion,” Silva said. “I’m being taught to ask the proper questions.”
HBS Deputy Dean for Academic Affairs W. Carl Kester said he helped create the NFL program after he was approached by Michael J. Haynes, NFL vice president of player and employee development.
Working with members of the NFL Players Association, Kester and Haynes devised a curriculum that would teach players to be better business owners and managers.
In order take part in the workshop, players had to fill out an application that included a short essay. According to Silva, more than 100 players applied.
“I think this is a great tool that the NFL offers,” Clark said. “Being taught by these professors is a true joy.”

Most Harvard students have never heard the words “solipsism,” “fantoccini,” or “einkorn,” but two-time Scripps National Spelling Bee contestant Jack A. Ausick ’13 spelled them flawlessly last night at the second annual Freshman Spelling Bee.
After seven rounds of competition at the Cambridge Queen’s Head, Ausick defeated 21 freshmen with the spelling of “zydeco,” a popular type of music from southern Louisiana featuring washboards and accordions. As his prize, Ausick took home $100 and 100 intramural points for his dorm, Greenough.
Colin Zwanziger ’13 of Wigglesworth and Julie M. Zauzmer ’13, a Crimson news editor of Straus, came in second and third, respectively.
“I like the interesting words,” Ausick said of spelling bees. “I just like the relationship with language you get from studying it.”
The Freshman Dean’s Office, which hosted the event, hopes to introduce more non-athletic intramural activities in the future, such as Guitar Hero competitions or trivia tournaments, said Katie W. Steele, the Director for Freshman Programming.
Before the competition began, the contestants—comprising a mix of spelling bee veterans and untrained novices—rifled through enormous dictionaries, quizzing each other on esoteric words.
“I won state in seventh grade, but that’s when you’re a little kid and can soak up everything like a sponge,” said Brooke R. Lee ’13 of Canaday.
Ellie L. Hylton ’13 of Wigglesworth said before the competition that she expected her peers to have an excellent command of the English language.
“I’m extremely nervous, but I have nothing to lose,” Hylton said. “My goal is just to make it through the first round.”
Hylton ended up breezing through the first two rounds but tripped up on “oud.”
All the contestants easily passed the first round, rattling off words like “leotard” and “samurai.”
But the freshmen started dropping off during the third round, as a string of words including “rejoneador,” “concupiscent,” and “schnauzer” left many befuddled.
The audience also became increasingly vocal as the competition escalated. One zealous spectator expressed his disbelief when his friend was asked to spell “jabot,” pronounced jah-BO.
“What did [the emcee] say? Jai ho?” he asked, to the audience’s amusement.
The event was organized by last year’s winner Athena L. Lao ’12 and former National Spelling Bee champion George A. Thampy ’10.
Thampy, who was featured in the 2002 documentary “Spellbound,” said that he does not believe spelling is an innate talent, but rather a skill that can be developed by studying etymology and linguistics.
“I love the eclecticism of the English language and how it’s showcased in a unique way,” Thampy said. “I learned more from the National Spelling Bee than from anything else I’ve done.”

Catholics on campus are talking about sex.
Last night, a talk on contemporary Catholic sexual ethics kicked off the Lenten speaker series “What’s Sex Got to Do With It?”
A mixed crowd of undergraduates and graduate students listened to Boston College Professor of Theology Lisa S. Cahill call for religious dialogue to deal more directly with today’s sexual culture.
“How many of you know what ‘Humanae Vitae’ is?” Cahill asked, referring to Pope Paul VI’s 1968 letter affirming traditional Catholic teachings against birth control.
A few hands went up.
“How many of you know what hook-ups are?”
Many more raised hands and nervous laughter followed.
Cahill’s unexpected turn from papal encyclicals to sexual slang characterized an address that asked students to examine what religious tradition has to say about the sexual realities of college.
Cahill—who served as the former president of both the Catholic Theological Society of America and the Society of Christian Ethics—focused on the tension between Catholic sexual teaching and the modern culture of casual sexual interaction.
She urged a shift in discourse from “Humanae Vitae” issues, such as gay marriage, gender equality, and contraceptive use, to topics like casual sex.
During her talk, which was sponsored by Harvard’s Episcopalian Chaplaincy and Memorial Church, Cahill said many students she has spoken with feel uncomfortable with the culture of casual sex, despite its prevalence.
“The ideal is so far from the reality that the ideal can’t even speak to the reality,” Cahill said. “I’m not saying that Church doctrine needs to just capitulate, but those who are loyal to the tradition need to bring it forward in a more positive way.”
Cahill discussed the issue of personal integrity, referring to Pope John Paul II’s “Theology of the Body.” For John Paul II, the purpose of sex was two-fold—to express permanent love and commitment, and to procreate, she added.
Urging the audience to ask, “What does sex mean to us?” Cahill advocated a balanced consideration of doctrine and personal feelings.
Several students at the event responded with enthusiastic scrutiny, challenging Cahill with questions about Catholic attitudes toward abortion, evolution, and divorce.
Other students—representing a range of religions—had positive views about the sex talk.
“I think to have a talk like this on a campus that has been identified as not very religious is important because it provides a religious perspective on the hook-up culture,” said Christine M. Mitchell, a student at the Divinity School, referencing a Feb. 11 Newsweek article, “Harvard’s Crisis of Faith.”

A few hundred people crowded inside Geological Lecture Hall yesterday to hear Smithsonian curator Bruce D. Smith chronicle the evolution in human lifestyle from hunting and gathering to agriculture.
The lecture, entitled “Where our Food Comes From: The Origins of Agriculture,” was the second installation in the three-part “Food for Thought” series sponsored by the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
Smith discussed the slow transition of earlier humans from wild to domesticated food sources, focusing on pigs, corn, squash, and sunflowers.
“How long did it take humans to transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture?” Smith asked in a slide.
He answered with an analogy.
“Our ancestors were cruising along in a Volkswagen bus, taking their time,” he responded, amid chuckles from the audience.
In his hour-long lecture, Smith also spoke about topics ranging from various areas in the world that independently domesticated plants and animals to methods that archeobiologists use to determine the time period during which certain seeds were domesticated.
Smith later delved into topics such as the domestication of cats and dogs.
“Cats and dogs were never really a prey species, but [they had a] mutually beneficial relationship [with humans]. Dogs have come a lot further into [that] relationship than cats,” Smith said.
Lauren Schumacher ’10, a molecular and cellular biology concentrator earning a secondary field in archeology, said she enjoyed the lecture.
“I thought it was a really interesting overview of where [domestication] happens and how we are looking at the big questions of when it happened, how it is,” Schumacher said.
Other audience members echoed Schumacher’s sentiments.
“I liked hearing him talk about why certain animals became domesticated,” Kevin Verbael ’10 said.
Tom Scanlon, the assistant director of public programs at the Natural History Museum, attributed the high turnout of Harvard students at the event to a high public interest in food and sustainability.
“It comes right down to it: Is there going to be enough food for the world?” Scanlon asked.

Using an array of high-performance lenses integrated on a chip containing microfluids, researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have developed a way to accurately detect microscopic activity.
The development, published on Jan. 18 in the British journal Lab on a Chip, allows scientists to better monitor experiments with microfluidics, which involves manipulating miniscule amounts of liquids to scale down lab processes to a micro-sized package.
Unlike methods used in the past, this development holds potential for more reliable results, said SEAS Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering Kenneth B. Crozier, who directed the research.
“One usually has to use an expensive and bulky microscope [to observe] a limited region of the chip,” Crozier said. “[Our optical detection system] gives us effectively more than 60 microscopes on [one] chip.”
Crozier added that the new system is scalable and reusable.
The team’s device, which can analyze nearly 200,000 droplets per second, works like a stop-motion camera, capturing images of the drops as they travel down multiple channels of the microfluidic system.
SEAS Physics Professor David A. Weitz, who co-authored the article, said that microfluidics offers a much more efficient alternative to traditional lab methods.
“Think of the [significance] of the single transistor 30 or 40 years ago,” Weitz said. “Now they make millions of transistors all together. And [microfluidics] is similarly going to let us do many, many things in parallel. Experiments can literally go a million times faster.”
The new technology may eventually be incorporated into GnuBio, a start-up company that the researchers hope to spin off from their work in microfluidics.
Weitz said the new technology could cut down costs of running lab experiments as well as speed up lab processes from several months to a few hours.
“We could do something that right now costs maybe $300,000 and do it for 30,” Weitz said. “It’s what’s so exciting about microfluidics.”
“We haven’t done it yet, but it is our dream,” he added.

In a finding that bodes well for the development of new human antibiotics, Harvard researchers have determined the identity of the trigger that causes roundworm bacteria to excrete virulent substances.
Harvard Medical School Professor Jon Clardy teamed with researchers in the department of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology to pinpoint the amino acid proline—a component of hemolymph, or insect blood—as the trigger for the transformation of roundworm bacteria from dormant to virulent, eliciting comparisons of the bacteria to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
The two groups of bacteria, called Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, reside dormant in the gut of roundworms—also called nematodes—until they are “switched on” to excrete antibiotics, digestive enzymes, and insecticidal toxins.
The mixture allows roundworms to launch “a pathogenic attack” against the insect larvae and to subsequently consume it as food, according to the study’s co-author Renee Kontnik, a BCMP research assistant.
“Proline charges the bacteria’s proton motive force, and that’s what gives the microbe the energy to be virulent and produce the toxins,” said co-author Jason M. Crawford, a BCMP research fellow.
Researchers said that the ability to manipulate the trigger causing the bacteria to release virulent factors suggests the possibility of discovering a method to “switch off” the release of harmful substances in the human body.
In addition, the discovery may provide leads in the search for other antibiotic compounds produced by bacteria, according to Kontnik.
“Since the discovery of penicillin, scientists have been looking at the same types of bugs and finding the same compounds, which is problematic because the rediscovery rate is so high,” Crawford said.
“We were looking for methods to turn on the production of new encoded molecules as a drug discovery platform, which would eventually allow science to find new small molecules that lead to the new big antibiotic,” Crawford added.
HMS Professor Raghu Kalluri, who is associated with the BCMP department, said that the discovery of the proline trigger will serve as a useful example for scientists seeking to understand how cancer cells evolve and also how normal cells are co-opted by cancer cells in a given organ.
When normal cells are hijacked by cancer cells, the natural substances are similarly triggered to aid the proliferation of the cancer. Just as the Harvard scientists were searching for the transforming factor in the case of the roundworm, the trigger of how normal cells aid cancer cells in becoming lethal tumors is “the unknown everybody is going after right now in cancer research,” Kalluri said.
“Nature’s role is absolutely relevant,” he added. “Understanding how our body protects against disease and harnessing that protection to shore up the body’s natural defense mechanisms is the best way to protect against disease.”

The recently discovered effects of a common over-the-counter drug may have important implications for the treatment and prevention of heart attacks and strokes, according to a study published Sunday in the journal Nature Biotechnology.
Through an innovative drug screening process designed to find compounds that target cellular energy metabolism, a team of researchers at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital found that the drug Meclizine has the potential to revolutionze the way doctors treat strokes and heart attacks.
“This is the first time nutrient sensitized screening has been used to identify drug targets in human cells,” said Vishal M. Gohil, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-lead author of the study. “People never thought it was possible to do this approach on the scale we did.”
The researchers focused on studying the biology of mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell where the biochemical processes of energy production occur. Human cells have the ability to switch between mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, and do so many times throughout the day to match the body’s energy needs with its activities.
“We were interested in trying to better understand how this switching takes place under normalcy, because we thought there might be some diseases characterized by a bias in one direction,” said Vamsi K. Mootha, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of systems biology at HMS.
The team screened nearly 3,700 compounds—over a third of all FDA-approved drugs—to determine those that could effect a shift from respiration to glycolysis. In the process, researchers discovered that Meclizine can inhibit mitochondrial respiration by shifting cellular metabolism—a promising find for the treatment of heart attacks and strokes.
“Research has shown that if you modulate respiration a little bit you get a lot of protection from ischemic [related to restriction in blood supply] injuries like strokes and heart attack,” Gohil said.
“Our hypothesis predicted that these compounds that inhibit respiration should be protective in ischemic events and that is exactly what we found,” Gohil added.
Although Meclizine has been used as an over-the-counter treatment for nausea and vertigo since the 1950s, doctors had never before recognized its additional therapeutic potential.
But further research must be conducted with animal models and humans to better understand the drug’s effects, according to Sunil A. Sheth ’04, a co-lead author of the study.
“While this research could be useful for patients at higher risk for ischemia, we still need to nail down how exactly this drug is causing cells to rewire their metabolism,” Sheth said. “Our findings are very exciting, but so far we have only done animal trials and remain cautiously optimistic about applications in humans.”
The study was funded by grants from the American Diabetes Association and the Smith Family Foundation.

Ethan A. Kruse ’12 may spend hours each week in front of a computer screen—but he’s not dallying on virtual playgrounds like World of Warcraft or Counterstrike. The astrophysics concentrator has far loftier preoccupations —literally.
Kruse is analyzing the magnetic field measurements of one of the smallest and most common stars in the universe, the M dwarf star.
In his research, Kruse analyzes the magnetic fields of approximately 50,000 stars and characterizes the evolution of these fields over time. He studies these magnetic fields—which are generated by the motion of plasma inside a star—to better understand the impact they may have on neighboring planets and to compare them to the sun’s own magnetic field.
“These stars are roughly 80 percent of the stars in the entire universe, and yet we have no idea why they have magnetic fields at all,” said Kruse, who submitted his research for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.
Assistant Professor of Astronomy Edo Berger, who teaches an introductory course in observational astronomy, offered Kruse a research position at the end of the previous academic year.
“He has a natural talent for understanding how real astronomy works, how to handle data, and how to analyze observations,” Berger said.
During the summer, Kruse participated in the Program for Research in Science and Engineering while conducting his research. He also travelled to Princeton University to meet with some of the professors who conducted the Sloan Digital Sky Survey—a major project collating observational data about stellar objects.
Kruse, who used the data from the survey for his research, discussed with the professors how to use the data to measure magnetic fields over time.
“He used an existing set of observations but in a completely different way from other people that used these observations,” Berger said.
Using data from his research, Kruse plans to conduct a second study that focuses on the magnetic properties of a smaller subset of five to ten thousand stars.
Berger said that Kruse is an example of how an undergraduate can produce meaningful research in astronomy.
“I think it’s something that’s unique to astronomy where students could really make a big impact even when they are young,” Berger said.
Gurtina Besla, a graduate student in the department of astronomy and Kruse’s teaching fellow in Astronomy 16, pointed to the importance of undergraduates integrating themselves into the community of students and faculty members passionate about this field of study.
“He’s becoming really involved with the astronomy community,” Besla said. “I think that’s something that most undergraduates really need to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Merely days after the devastating Haitian earthquake of Jan. 12, Stephanie Rosborough ’96 and Hilarie Cranmer arrived via helicopter to set up a field hospital near Port-au-Prince at an orphanage and school run by the organization Love A Child.
Rosborough, international emergency medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Cranmer, assistant professor of global health and population at the Harvard School of Public Health, used their many years of experience in dealing with worldwide crises to mobilize the volunteers, resources, and supplies needed to set up a fully functional rehabilitation clinic in less than a week.
The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative—which provides training for disaster relief—helped to build the hospital and find funding for its construction, according to HHI Co-Director Michael J. VanRooyen.
The duo opted to set up a rehabilitation center rather than a primary care facility because of the nature of care required after earthquakes. Unlike other natural disasters, such as tsunamis, earthquakes cause extensive injuries that often require long-term orthopedic and neurological care, according to Rosborough.
“The types of injuries people have make it so that they need about three months of healing before they are able to mobilize themselves,” Rosborough said. “People in the thousands have nowhere to go after emergency treatment.”
The HHI-sponsored field hospital fills this treatment gap, and to date has provided care for at least 720 patients. At any given time, there are over 1,000 individuals in the hospital—about 700 are patients and their family members, and 300 are hospital staff and hired Haitian nationals, Cranmer said.
Cranmer and Rosborough planned to run the clinic for a minimum of six months before turning it over completely to local management, but they now think that they will likely remain in charge for a year. Their goal is “true re-integration” of the hospital into Haitian hands—rather than “just packing up and saying bye,” Cranmer said.
The main challenge they currently face is finding funding to keep the hospital running, primarily through private donations, the United Nations, and the United States Agency for International Development, Rosborough said.
“A lot of us are actually putting out our own personal cash,” Cranmer said.
The field hospital provides free treatment to all its patients, as well as meals and basic care for family members. When patients are discharged—most often to the refugee camp 15 minutes from the hospital—they receive a “Dignity Package” containing cooking supplies, clothing, food, diapers, and sanitary napkins.
Volunteers from the hospital also staff a small clinic at the camp to provide basic care and OB/GYN services, Cranmer said.
Patients who opt to return to Port-au-Prince—though cautioned against it—are supplied with tents, sleeping bags, and cab fare to enable safe and free travel, Cranmer said.
Despite the desperate need of the Haitian people and the challenges they will face in upcoming years, Rosborough and Cranmer said that they sense optimism in the air.
“Haitians love Haiti; a lot of people love Haiti and they want to see it rise from the ashes,” Rosborough said.
“A lot of people said ‘Look, maybe in a way this wipes the slate clean and will allow us to build things in a way that was better than before,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School assistant professor Paul M. Copeland routinely gives about a dozen industry-sponsored talks each year, earning anywhere from $1,250 to $2,000 per gig.
Copeland, who heads the endocrinology division at Partners Healthcare-affiliate North Shore Medical Center, says he isn’t in it for the money.
These information sessions—or “talks for docs”—improve patient care, he says, and all the material he presents has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
But due to a new Partners policy announced last April, Copeland cannot register for the 2010 speaking cycle.
Partners Healthcare, which owns Harvard-affiliates Mass. General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, recently overhauled its conflict of interest policy, which proponents hail as one of the strictest in the nation.
Under the revised policy, Partners employees face a host of restrictions, including bans on speaking at industry-sponsored events and receiving stock options from pharmaceutical companies. Outside pay for senior officials sitting on boards of drug or medical device-making companies has been capped as well.
Though many regard the new policy as a much-needed check on industry ties to medicine—an issue that has received heightened national scrutiny in recent years—some Partners employees caution that the new restrictions may be too broad and could ultimately stifle essential physician activity.
For example, continuing medical education talks sponsored by drug companies, Copeland argues, provide doctors with the latest information on treatments and address patient care issues.
“If the talks are well done, you educate physicians about the proper role of medications,” Copeland says, adding that he regularly fields an hour’s worth of questions from doctors who attend his talks about case studies and alternative treatments.
“Patients and doctors benefit from these talks,” Copeland says. “That’s why it’s so disheartening.”
LONG IN THE WORKS
In the fall of 2007, Partners Healthcare embarked on a conflict of interest review to better define the relationship between industry and medicine as well as strengthen oversight of physician activity with drug companies.
Conflict of interest issues gained national attention the following year, when Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, alleged that Mass. General psychiatrist Joseph Biederman received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs that he used to treat children for bipolar disorders.
As Grassley charged other prominent physicians across the nation with similar allegations, many medical institutions looked to revamp existing policies in the face of national scrutiny.
Harvard Medical School began a review of its own conflict of interest policy in Jan. 2009 in conjunction with Harvard’s currently ongoing efforts to develop University-wide recommendations and guidelines.
Medical School professor David B. Acker, who is also chief of obstetrics at Brigham and Women’s, says he approves of Partners’ new policy, which was released in April 2009 and is now being implemented.
“I can’t comment on how other people viewed this, but to me, it came late,” Acker says. “It has been an obvious problem for some time.”
WALKING THE LINE
But several other employees have raised concerns that its reach may have detrimental effects on physicians’ activities, such as continuing medical education.
Though Medical School professor Charles N. Serhan, who served on the committee that issued the policy recommendations, says he applauds the policy’s aims to rein in conflicts of interest issues, he cautions that its expansive reach does not come without costs.
“I feel that the pendulum is a little too far in one direction in that our rules are now too tight and could actually stifle innovation,” Serhan says. “With time, it has to come back to some equilibrium.”
Mass. General’s chief surgeon Andrew L. Warshaw acknowledges the necessity of Partners’ policy overhaul but says he is concerned that certain initiatives such as surgical fellowships, which are generally dependent on industry funding, may suffer from the crackdown on outside funding.
“Let’s say that you have a general surgeon who wants to learn minimally invasive techniques, a scenario that is commonly funded by outside interests,” he says. “Is that a bad thing? When someone gets training that they wouldn’t normally get and helps patients?”
Warshaw adds that maintaining the necessary relationship between industry and medicine without distorting physician incentives remains a challenge.
“Society has to make a decision about what skills or new knowledge it wants and values and how it will pay for them, “ he said. “This is the narrow line that we are trying to walk.”
NO MORE TALK
Meanwhile, Barry W. Levine, a clinical professor at the Medical School who has worked at Mass. General for four decades, says he is still figuring out how the new policy will impact his profession.
Levine spoke about lung disease on behalf of drug companies like AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline for about 18 years but says he does not plan to take on any more speaking engagements until the implications of the policy become clearer.
Like Copeland, he says that the new regulations stymie critical education about asthma and emphysema for doctors in underprivileged communities. He routinely meets physicians who do not have access to pulmonary function machines, which are critical for diagnosing these diseases.
“I don’t know why Partners suddenly said this is promoting a drug,” Levine says. “It certainly doesn’t in my mind.”
Moreover, Levine says, the drug companies sponsoring the talks have no power to censor what materials physicians present, as long as the information has been approved by the FDA.
“The drug companies do not tell me what I can say,” he says. “I’ll say what I want.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team (7-15-3, 7-8-3 ECAC) looks to build some momentum going into the final stretch of the season as it takes on perennial rival Cornell (15-7-3, 12-4-2 ECAC) at 7 p.m. tonight at the Bright Hockey Center.
The two teams have one of the oldest rivalries in college hockey, dating back to 1910 when the Crimson won 5-0 in New York City.
Harvard is coming off a win over No. 16 Union, in which sophomore forward Alex Killorn enjoyed a two-goal night, including a power play strike midway through the third period.
“It’s always great to beat a team like Union, ranked 16th nationally and tied for number one spot [in the conference],” captain Alex Biega said. “It gives you a little bit more confidence going into the game. You can grip your stick a little less going into the weekend.”
Yet the Crimson isn’t the only team going into tonight’s matchup coming off a win. The Big Red enjoyed a 6-2 victory over Colgate on Tuesday night and is now tied with Yale for the top spot in the ECAC. Cornell forward Riley Nash had two goals and two assists for a four-point effort.
The matchup promises to be intense. In addition to the historic nature of the game, both teams hope to put forth a strong finish to the season and improve conference rankings before the playoffs.
“We have four games left, two of which are huge games against rivalries, and we are battling for a bye in the fourth spot,” Biega said. “We want to be a playoff game team—a team that is playing their best hockey at the end of the season.”
“Our season has been a bit disappointing at times, but fortunately, in our league every team makes the playoffs,” senior forward Doug Rogers added. “We are right in the middle of the pack so if we can do well in these last four games we can finish in a decent spot in our league, and we can make a good run in the playoffs.”
That might be easier said than done. Harvard has been streaky this season. Prior to the win against the Dutchmen, it had won only one match in the last seven contests.
“It’s obviously been a tough stretch for us—we haven’t been able to find our groove,” Biega said.
The Big Red’s season couldn’t be more different. The team has been strong throughout the season, and that consistency has resulted in 12 conference victories.
“They play a very strong game physically down low, and give up nothing defensively,” Biega said.
Among those twelve victories was a convincing 6-3 win over the Crimson earlier in the season. Though Harvard was up 3-1 midway through the second period, the team saw its hope for an upset evaporate as the Big Red scored the game’s final five goals, including three in the last period.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, third period breakdowns have been an ongoing theme throughout the season. To date, Harvard has been outscored 41-21 by its opponents in the last frame.
Notwithstanding, the team feels optimistic and confident going into tonight’s game.
“I think we’ve realized that Cornell is a very good team, and in my career we’ve had some success against Cornell,” Rogers said. “I think we have a good recipe for beating them and, coming off a win, I think we have good confidence going into the game. We are just going to try to keep coming offensively and if we can tighten up a little defensively I think we’ll be fine against Cornell.”
Biega echoed those sentiments.
“We have a well thought-out game plan, if we can play tight and stay out of penalty box, I think that we will be capable of having a good weekend.”
The Crimson currently sits at a precarious eighth in the ECAC league—the lowest spot that is guaranteed home-ice for the first round of the playoffs. Harvard needs more victories to take control of that spot, making these next four games, especially tonight’s crucial.
“Our league is so tight anyone can beat anyone on any given night,” Biega said. “We just have to focus on our game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s contests mark the end of the regular season and the longest road trip thus far for the No. 5 Harvard (17-6-4, 12-6-2 ECAC) women’s hockey team. The Crimson plays St. Lawrence (14-11-7, 10-7-3) tonight and No. 6 Clarkson (20-8-4, 14-4-2) tomorrow.
With a mere three points separating the third- and seventh-place teams in the ECAC, these two matchups have the potential to considerably impact the postseason landscape. Depending upon how conference games unfold in the next few days, Harvard could fall anywhere between being tied for first place in the ECAC and dropping to the seventh spot.
A strong performance this weekend against the Saints and Golden Knights would also reward the Crimson with a much-coveted home-ice advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, received only by the top four teams.
Harvard understands the long-run significance of the back-to-back road matchups.
“It’s really important for our team emotionally,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “We’ll do whatever it takes to win, but being at home would definitely be huge.”
The Crimson faced both St. Lawrence and Clarkson earlier in the regular season. Harvard skated to a 3-0 victory over the Saints back in November, improving its overall head-to-head record against St. Lawrence to 27-11-5. But the Crimson’s last faceoff against the Golden Knights ended in a tight 1-0 loss.
Harvard coach Katey Stone notes that this time around, both the Crimson and its opponents are different teams.
“We need to stay focused,” Stone emphasized. “Everybody needs to play her position and be willing to put up 60 minutes of great hockey.”
Indeed, Harvard faces formidable opponents in St. Lawrence and Clarkson. The Saints currently occupy the seventh spot in the ECAC standings and are safely into the playoffs. Despite losing to sixth-place Princeton last weekend, St. Lawrence remains well within striking distance of the Crimson.
The Saints are reputed for their disciplined style of play and traditional ECAC-powerhouse status to match.
“St. Lawrence is definitely a hard-working and quick team,” Farni said.
Coming into tomorrow’s game, the Golden Knights boast an impressive record, tied atop the conference standings with Cornell. Strong outings against Dartmouth and Harvard this weekend would bring the optimal end to a storied run for Clarkson, which seeks its first-ever ECAC regular-season title. But the Golden Knights have struggled of late, winning just one of their last five conference games.
Clarkson’s offense is led by senior Dominique Thibault, who is third in the conference with 34 points on the season. The Golden Knights’ tough defense and physical presence on the ice will also factor into the Crimson’s game plan.
Harvard has a challenging weekend of hockey ahead, but it hopes to rely on the same unwavering mantra that has propelled the Crimson to the forefront of women’s hockey over the past few seasons.
“We need to play our game, be well rested, communicate with each other, and come out with high pace and tempo, getting back to our style of hockey,” Stone remarked. “The preparation is no different [than for any other game].”
Furthermore, the last time the Crimson faced Clarkson in November, it was without power forward junior Liza Ryabkina, who was suffering from a dislocated kneecap. Ryabkina led Harvard to the Beanpot final this month with a stunning four-goal performance against Boston College. In the championship game, she then netted the game-winner against Northeastern. Ryabkina was named tournament MVP for her efforts.
A native of the Ukraine, the talented Crimson right-winger was nominated Wednesday for the Patty Kazmaier Award, along with teammates junior forward Kate Buesser, junior defender Leanna Coskren, and senior goaltender Christina Kessler. The award is presented each year to the country’s top Division I women’s hockey player.
But the players are not the only ones receiving distinctions this week. Coach Stone is poised to break the all-time NCAA career wins record. She needs one win this weekend to tie Laura Halldorson’s record of 337 wins and a clean sweep to surpass it.
During her tenure at Harvard, Coach Stone has left an indelible mark on not only the program but also on the players.
“She’s one of the biggest reasons I came to Harvard,” Farni said. “She has an awesome reputation in and outside of Harvard. She’s widely respected, and that’s only reinforced by the fact that she’s been invited to coach some of the U.S. national teams. All of the success we’ve had is due to her guidance, careful recruiting, and knowledge of the game.”
The players’ prowess on the ice, coupled with Coach Stone’s distinguished leadership, is sure to pose a daunting obstacle for the Crimson’s opponents this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, in the biggest men’s basketball game in school history, Harvard will face Cornell. Ever heard of it? (Its most famous alum is Andy Bernard).
Last weekend, Penn did the unthinkable and, with a 3-15 record, soundly defeated the then-No. 22 Big Red, 79-64. The score elicited double takes around the country with some calling it the biggest upset of the college basketball season.
Cornell bounced back the next night against Princeton in a battle for first place in the Ivy League. The Big Red survived a last-second three from Douglas Davis to escape with a gritty 48-45 win.
Meanwhile, the Crimson escaped an upset bid from Yale, rallying from three points down in the final minute. A free throw by sophomore Oliver McNally with 1.4 seconds left forced overtime, where Harvard edged Yale despite having Jeremy Lin on the bench after fouling out.
The following night against Brown, the Crimson pulled away late, winning 81-67, thanks largely to a monster effort from its two healthy big men, co-captain Doug Miller and freshman Kyle Casey.
Where does all this leave the Ivies?
Three teams control their own destiny. Cornell and Princeton will win the league outright if either runs the table, whereas Harvard will clinch at least a share of the title if it manages to win out. For that reason, the playoffs start tonight in Lavietes.
The Big Red is easily the favorite. Three weeks ago, it embarrassed the Crimson in Ithaca with an 86-50 drubbing. Jeff Foote scored at will. Cornell knocked down 12 threes. Lin led Harvard with eight turnovers.
Since then, the Crimson has lost another big man, sophomore Andrew Van Nest—this time to pneumonia (Van Nest and classmate Keith Wright are out of tonight’s game, and senior Pat Magnarelli is questionable with a high ankle sprain).
Yet the outlook is surprisingly bright for tonight’s contest. The Crimson is riding a wave of good karma after its first road sweep in 10 years, due mostly to the freshmen getting over their winter swoon: Casey won Ivy Player of the Week, Brandyn Curry carried Harvard on his back late in the Yale game, and both Christian Webster and Dee Giger found their stroke.
The Big Red, on the other hand, is not playing its best ball, with its shocking loss to Penn (which Harvard beat by 14 previously) and a narrow (albeit impressive) win over the Tigers.
The last outcome, 86-50, looms, but every sports movie has an equivalent. Henry Rowengartner surrendered a homerun, hit a batter, and threw a wild pitch in his first appearance for the Cubs in Rookie of the Year. The Little Giants trailed the Cowboys by 21 points at halftime. The Mighty Ducks lost to the Hawks 17-0 before beating them to win the state championship. The Jamaicans finished last in the first heat of Cool Runnings (maybe a bad example because they ultimately lose, but who isn’t jacked up by these Winter Olympics! No?).
For a real-life example, the Soviets beat team USA 10-3 before the Miracle on Ice.
I don’t know if this Crimson team is destined for Hollywood. All I know is, I…I Believe…I Believe That…I Believe That We…
CORNELL (21-4, 7-1 Ivy)                            at HARVARD (17-5, 6-2 Ivy)
…I Believe That We Will Play Very Well.
Harvard is certainly capable of taking down Cornell. It has the best player on the court in Lin, the hottest player in the league in Casey, and a raucous home crowd that is finally earning the “Crimson Crazies” moniker.
But Cornell has far more weapons with as many as seven players capable of leading the team in scoring. It can go inside and outside, play on the break or in the half court.
Whether or not Magnarelli can offer meaningful minutes will be critical. In Ithaca, Foote abused every defender the Crimson threw at him, and Harvard is even more shorthanded now. I don’t know that Magnarelli can hold up, and for that reason, the smart money is on Cornell.
Pick: Cornell 74, Harvard 70.
YALE (10-15, 4-4 Ivy)                                 at PRINCETON (15-6, 6-1 Ivy)
The Bulldogs showed a lot of fight against the Crimson last weekend. Ultimately, the team sinks or swims with standout Alex Zampier, who is terrifying to both his opponents and his teammates. He can catch fire and light it up, or he can force it and kill the offense.
Game after game, Princeton proves its worth. The three-point loss to the Big Red was nothing to hang its head over, and it bounced back nicely with a 58-51 win against Penn at the Palestra. I see the Tigers protecting their home court and continuing to roll.
Pick: Princeton 56, Yale 47.
BROWN (8-17, 2-6 Ivy)                       at PENN (4-17, 3-4 Ivy)
The overall records of these two teams are misleading. The last six games provide a clearer picture: Brown, 1-5, and Penn, 3-3. The Quakers topped the Bears three weeks ago on a contentious tip-in at the buzzer. That game was in Providence. This game is in Philadelphia, the fourth of five straight home games for Penn. Zack Rosen’s reputation continues to grow after engineering the upset over Cornell (“We expected to win,” he deadpanned after the game). I like the resurgent Quakers grabbing another win over struggling Brown.
Pick: Penn 70, Brown 64.
COLUMBIA (9-13, 3-5 Ivy)                   at DARTMOUTH (4-18, 0-8 Ivy)
Dartmouth is doomed by its inability to score. Only three times this season have the Big Green scored more than 60 points (by comparison Cornell and Harvard have scored less than 60 points a total of four times combined). Dartmouth will only win a game if the other team beats itself. I can’t predict when that will happen. I’ll guess it’s not tonight.
Pick: Columbia 67, Dartmouth 61.
BROWN at PRINCETON
The Bears’ front line of Mullery, Sullivan, Halpern, and McCarthy is its supposed strength, yet it all but disappeared against a very shorthanded Crimson team. Brown is simply incapable of winning without those four. I see Princeton winning this game and setting the stage for another first-place showdown with the Big Red.
Pick: Princeton 55, Brown 50.
YALE at PENN
Yale handled Penn last time the two squared off, 61-48. In that game, the Quakers shot an abysmal 1-for-18 on three-pointers. This Penn team is playing with far more swagger now than in January, when it was 1-14. But Yale has also been playing well for the last month. The Bulldogs’ only bad league loss came at the start of conference play against Brown. The winner of this game will likely claim sole possession of fourth place in the Ivy. I give Yale the slight edge.
Pick: Yale 68, Penn 66.
CORNELL at DARTMOUTH
This could get ugly. The Dartmouth team might have more fun if it goes to see Shutter Island instead.
Pick: Cornell 80, Dartmouth 60.
COLUMBIA at HARVARD
Columbia’s wins have come against some of the worst teams in college basketball: Bryant, Bucknell, Wagner, American, Dartmouth, Brown, and Penn all have an RPI lower than 250. Harvard is banged up and is facing the Lions on the back end of the weekend, but it would be a monumental upset if Columbia prevailed.
Pick: Harvard 70, Columbia 64.
RECORD LAST WEEK: 6-2 (To date: 19-5).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost any college athlete will say that his or her sport’s season lasts all year long no matter what the official schedule might say. Between the summer training, preseason exhibitions, weight lifting, conference games, and postseason tournaments, there’s little time left.
This is especially true for the Harvard men’s and women’s crew teams. Although they are officially spring sports, both train during the summer break, participate in fall races such as the Head of the Charles, and even keep competing throughout the winter months.
That said, the teams usually head to more hospitable environments to avoid Cambridge’s frigid temperatures and the frozen river. A training trip to Miami was a welcome excursion for the squads during winter break, and just last weekend some Crimson rowers headed to Boston University’s Agganis Arena to compete in the CRASH-Bs World Indoor Rowing Championships.
In the annual event, participants take to the aisles of erg machines lined up across the arena’s floor to individually sprint 2Ks against the clock. Although world-class rowers have set several records at the event, most competitors recognize that the indoor set-up is most likely not the best measure of how an athlete will fair in a real regatta.
With this dilemma in mind, some rowers have come up with another solution for what to do when their usual waterways freeze over: row on ice.
While the new technique isn’t exactly widespread, some rowing groups have pioneered newly designed “boats” especially for such practice. They have attached blades to the bottom of the boat and use ice picks in place of oars to help the boat glide smoothly across a frozen river or lake.
One Massachusetts man has even patented his own design that he describes on his website as a combination of elements from iceboats, bicycles, and rowing shells to create a vehicle powered by traditional rowing movements.
Harvard’s teams may not be adopting the novel idea anytime soon, but don’t be surprised if you see a daredevil or two trying it out on a nearby pond or even a still-solid section of the Charles.

You know that Facebook is en route to taking over the world when politicians start putting up advertisements for themselves on its sidebar. Stephen Pagliuca, unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senator seat formerly occupied by Mass. Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, was recently spotted encouraging users on Facebook to “Become a Fan.” Now we have to wonder, is Pagliuca gearing up for another run?
Pagliuca, a graduate of Harvard Business School, was described as a “Democratic activist, economic and business expert and co-owner of the Boston Celtics” in the ad, which also included a picture of him sporting a bright red tie. Looking sharp, Mr. Pagliuca! And way to show that you care about red states too.
Pagliuca dropped out of the spotlight after his stint to run for the December 2009 Democratic primary for U.S. Senator. However, this recent push for publicity may indicate a plan to reenter the political arena. As we all know, a successful politician must gain the support of the masses—one Facebook user at a time.

If you find jokes about what you would tell your eighth-grade crush funny, then you may laugh when you read the February issue of The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
According to the issue’s editor Nathaniel H. Stein ’10, the issue is themed “pursuing everything”—a rather vague answer that left us somewhat perplexed. But after reading the glossy pages of this New Yorker knock-off, we think the theme is something else: love.
The jokes of the issue revolve around love, sex, and the awkwardness inherent therein. It seems that this month, the Poonsters were entangled in the spirit (or lack thereof) of Valentine’s Day.
Though there was no specific target audience for the magazine, Stein quipped that “The Lampoon has a long history with prisoners and would like to get that [audience] back.”
In all seriousness, the issue does have its funny moments. Here are some highlights:
1. “Bread is to oven as penis is to…”
2. In “My Plan for Asking out the Girl I Liked in Fifth      Grade,” a boy describes how he will have a girlfriend by tomorrow      despite the fact that he “got caught sliding that booger underneath the      leg of [his] chair…”
3. Advice for  men who hope to pop the      question but don't know how to go about it: “Learn the      phrase ‘will you marry me’ in a really romantic language that she      knows, and practice saying it over and over in a mirror. Now imagine how      easy it will be in English!”
If you’re curious about what makes the content of this issue different from Lampoon sex jokes of issues past, well, “all the pieces are different from the ones that have run before,” Stein said. So, for more insight into the complexities of love, check out the magazine for yourself.

Harvard what? Harvard Shorts Film Festival,  the first of its kind at Harvard, is a university-wide filmmaking contest that will feature the best three-minute digital  movies made by anyone in the Harvard community. If walking down the crimson carpet and enjoying celebrity status aren’t enough incentives, winners  can also win prizes of up to $750.
The catch is that the movie must be related to academic research and teaching. The goal of the festival emphasizes the creative translation of scholarly content into an interactive multimedia presentation. Sponsored by the Office  for the Dean of Arts and Humanities, Harvard Shorts  is the brainchild of Shigehisa Kuriyama, a professor of East  Asian studies who is a strong proponent of incorporating media  projects into teaching and course assignments (like swapping podcasts  for papers). Through  this contest, Kuriyama hopes to demonstrate the powerful  ways that a film can convey a message to its audience, and how the  use of images and music can make a subject matter more interesting.
The best part is that you don't have to be technologically savvy or an aspiring filmmaker to enter the contest. The whole  idea behind Harvard Shorts is that nowadays, it's a lot easier to create  multimedia presentations with software like Keynote  and Movie Maker—you no longer need the expensive equipment that is traditionally used  to produce movies.
"Many people don't appreciate  how easy it is to use this medium without special training," Kuriyama said. "Basically  anybody can express their idea in this form of multimedia presentation."
The submission period starts on Mar. 15 and ends on April 9. Check out the Web site for more information. Who knows? This  might be your three minutes to fame.
