Who needs tabloids when there’s Twitter? Posting a shocking 1,382 percent increase in visitors year-over-year since February 2008, Twitter is the latest phenomenon in the recent surge of social interaction applications that have transformed the very idea of communication. A steady stream of constantly updated, readily available information has accompanied the emergence of an increasingly exhibitionist public. Moving beyond the sphere of interpersonal relations, this trend has crept into the artistic realm, raising questions about the status of art and its exhibition in society.Once predominantly a static creation relegated to the gallery or stage, art increasingly faces the same struggle as print media, grappling with the pressing need to remain relevant in a constantly changing world. Rather than succumb to archaism, or even extinction, innovators have seized upon the opportunities that the art-technology interface provides. In so doing, they have pioneered an approach to art that uses technology to catalyze interactions between individuals and artwork and between individuals through artwork.GOING DIGITAL“Digital technology is increasingly the medium that artists are working with today,” says Lauren Cornell, Executive Director of Rhizome, an organization dedicated to the creation, exhibition, and critique of largely web-based artistic enterprises. “When artists are working with the Internet and directly engaging with culture and society as it’s happening, those technologies are reshaping and challenging the world that we live in.”“This is art that’s at the forefront of culture,” she continues. “Not that painting isn’t, per se, but it’s difficult in general to illuminate and speak intelligently about culture as it is happening. Technology allows artists to really do that forward thinking.”With information saturation becoming the distinguishing trait of our current era, artists are not the only ones who recognize the need to keep pace with an evolving environment. As technology has innovated the world, the world—especially the sector which houses, supports, and encourages artistic creation—struggles with the question of how to innovate.“There’s an interesting institutional crisis related to how we’ve gone from an era where information was the main value proposition of most institutions—cultural, educational, industrial,” says Engineering and Applied Sciences Professor David Edwards, “to an era where information is so readily available that innovation becomes what’s valued… And innovation is connected to the ability of ideas to move from one discipline to the next, from the arts to the sciences.”Edwards, who teaches “Idea Translation: Effecting Change through the Arts and Sciences,” created the course to encourage artists and designers to dream, and subsequently arrive, at the frontier of science.“You’re not in art or in science but at the border of something we think of as opposites,” says Tarik Umar ’10, one of Edwards’ former students. “But that’s where you can be most innovative and think in a realm most un-thought in.”“Idea Translation” was the birthplace of MuseTrek, an application developed by Umar and Milo M. Harman ’08. Described by Edwards as a blend between YouTube and a Wikipedia devoted to art, MuseTrek—which has already undergone trial runs at the Fogg and the Louvre Museums—allows visitors to experience artwork through the eyes of another individual. The device uses the iPhone as its platform to store ‘Treks’; visitors can access routes through the museum and retrace their owners’ steps while reading an accompanying narrative. “It’s a social experience around art,” Umar says. “Right now you go to museums, and it’s not a social space. You’re in isolation, and you look at the paintings, read the placards, and you’re supposed to engage with the artwork.”MuseTrek, Umar explains, is an impetus for interaction. He describes the device as a means for the public to guide itself rather than rely on tour guides, who often fail to engage audiences (especially younger ones). “Stories written by someone your age, of your generation who speaks your language,” Umar says, “are more accessible, compared to a curator who speaks a more academic language.” “One goal is to have a bottom-up approach to the narrative where the public can create its own journey and share it with others,” Umar continues. “So you can see the museum from the point of view of an 11-year-old or a fashion designer or a tennis player.”A TEAM EFFORTAs MuseTrek culls the public’s diverse insights about art, individuals elsewhere are exploring how the process of artistic creation is affected by a collective. David L. Rice ’10 is working on a web-based project, The Gloaming, which he hopes will act as a crossroads where distinct individuals’ ideas and thoughts meet. “It’s an experiment to try to do something that’s interactive, but getting outside of the one-person-to-one-person interaction,” says Rice, who is a special concentrator in Esoteric Studies: Mysticism and Modernism in Western Thought. The Gloaming—what he describes as an “evolving online novel”—includes narration, illustration, and soundscapes that portray the experience of a disembodied brain in cyberspace.As visitors travel through The Gloaming, they experience the product of other people’s contributions to the site, even as they create an identity for themselves. After repeated visits, users can eventually access a forum where their additions, corrections, and deletions to the narrative appear as original components of the site. “This is a project where reading and writing are not so separate; the division between being in front of the words and behind them is not so clear,” Rice says.Rice refers to the project as an example of the way in which the Internet has challenged traditional notions of novel writing. Not only has the divide between artist and observer gradually deteriorated—as people from various fields of expertise connect in order to create the site and its story—but the creation of art itself has the potential to shift from a personal, private act to a public, open-ended experience.According to Helen Thorington, Co-Director of New Radio and Performing Arts (NRPA), the idea of art and the word “artist” have changed throughout history. With the Internet, these concepts are once again transforming. NRPA and its online forum, Turbulence.org, is a Boston-based organization that shares Rhizome’s mission of commissioning net art, among other emerging artistic forms. “The people who call themselves artists [who work with technology] are incorporating many disciplines that were formally excluded from the so-called artistic sphere,” she explains. And as a result, Thorington says, the boundaries of identity and expertise are becoming increasingly permeable.YOU SAY STALKING, I SAY ARTFor another organization, the art-technology phenomenon has inspired a line of research about how society and identity function in a world dominated by technology. The Sociable Media Group, whose focus on technologically-mediated communication often manifests itself through installation and design, has opened “Connections,” its most current exhibition at MIT’s Mark Epstein Innovation Gallery. “Metropath(ologies),” one installation of the exhibit, reveals the way in which individuals increasingly interact with technology—either deliberately or unwillingly, and sometimes even unwittingly.“‘Metropath(ologies)’ is interactive, but it gets away from the kind of interactive art that is more like a puppet piece—the ones where you see it and you wave your arm and something moves on a screen,” says Judith Donath, Director of the Sociable Media Group and a Faculty Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. “People look at ‘Metropath(ologies)’ more as an artwork than as an object that you try to figure out how to do something with it, how to manipulate it.”The installation is a multi-elemental piece that engages sight, sound, mind, and physical being. Computer and video screens flank a cluster of white, rectangular bars staggered by random height. Sounds sweep through the open space as the installation loops through three movements. The first sets a neutral and abstract tone; the second—which projects text from New York Times headlines onto the bars as processed voices recite news feeds into the space—emphasizes the fact that we live under a constant barrage of information; the final explores the ramifications of surveillance. Photographs of people who have walked through the exhibition appear on the white bars, as the system not only plays back the voices of previous visitors, but also reads aloud a list of phone numbers and addresses compiled from a database of their names. As a result, though the third movement is an artistic representation of surveillance, its existence and continuous innovation rely on the presence of the visitors themselves.“Technology allows people to interact with artifacts,” Donath says. “Technology creates art forms where people are a part of them… The object itself makes the audience part of it, and that is part of our statement about our increasingly collectivized society.”Similar to “Connections,” MuseTrek, Umar says, should induce a sense of unity between visitor and museum. “You feel like you own a little bit of the museum when you walk away,” he says. “Your presence lives on in the museum—it’s a cultural ownership.”“ART IS WEIRD”As innovative as technologies like MuseTrek have been in compelling interaction with artwork, doubts remain about the seamless integration of art and technology.“It’s important to not see art as driven as technology,” Cornell says. “Artists are turning technology into art, but… it’s less a celebration [of technology] and more about they employ it in their vision.”Thorington agrees, citing her work from the 1980s as an example of the way in which art, on some level, may remain independent of technology despite the possible and frequent unification of the two. “I used science as subject matter within the discipline of radio production,” she explains, “rather than allow that science to create the work.”In addition, artists may worry that a constant influx of other people’s opinions will inundate personal reactions to artwork, thereby indulging pretense. “Some artists may have a problem with it [MuseTrek],” Umar says.“They might believe it’s a personal thing, to look at the art and see your own life—that that’s something you should work towards and learn, learn how to look at art and enjoy art. Whereas MuseTrek makes it easier to do all of that.”“Technology and art are working together to create new experiences though,” Umar says, “and in doing so the combination is creating new art. People’s treks are new art.”Ultimately, the novelty of technology may be its defining characteristic—one which contributes to its ability to inspire interactive and creative production, and one which explains why individuals who consider themselves artists are still hesitant to completely accept the art-technology chimera.“Technology is appealing in an uncomfortable way,” says Rice. “But art is weird, and if something’s good it has to make you uncomfortable in some sort of way. There has to be something off about it in a controlled and intentional way.”“It can’t just reinforce the world,” he continues. “It has to draw out nuances of the world. So having a weird feeling about the medium you’re going into is good, if you’re able to make your art what you feel about it.”—Staff writer Denise J. Xu can be reached at dxu@fas.harvard.edu.

“There is something about the profession of impresario, the entire tribe of them, that has fascinated me ever since I learned that such weird and exotic beings existed,” said the late Clive Barnes, one of the preeminent dance critics from the turn of the 20th century. “I think I originally imagined them looking a little like Serge Diaghilev. A grandee of café society, yet a man of classless class, who wore his cultural and intellectual distinctions as casually as a subtle aroma of cologne.” The Sergei Diaghilev in question was a connoisseur extraordinaire and director of the famed Ballets Russes, a troupe that emerged in Europe in 1909 and proceeded to change the realm of culture and art around the entire globe forever. This year, its centennial is being celebrated everywhere from Moscow, Hamburg, Stockholm, Canberra, and Paris to the Boston area. From April 15 through 17, Harvard will host a three-day Ballets Russes Symposium comprised of an exhibition of rare documents and art at the Pusey Library, student performances in conjunction with the Office for the Arts Dance Program, and a stellar array of lecturers and panelists at the New College Theatre.The Ballets Russes harkens back to Great War glamour and intrigue—a time that recalls Proust, Joyce, Picasso, Stravinsky and Diaghilev all meeting for one legendary, mouthwatering dinner at the Paris Majestic, in the midst of the intellectual phenomenon that was the early 20th century modernist movement. Diaghilev introduced the novel idea that dance must exist not on its own but as a climactic collaboration between first-rate painters, musicians, and composers. The willingness of men from Picasso, Matisse, and Rouault to Ravel, Debussy and Stravinsky to collaborate with Diaghilev on his creations signaled the inauguration of a new interdisciplinary era in arts and culture, and dance in particular, that would shape all future exploits. Early Diaghilevan productions have not only remained in the repertory of many major ballet companies but have also taken their rightful places amidst the historical cannon. “Firebird” and “The Rite of Spring” (“Le Sacre du Printemps”), two ballets with specially commissioned scores by Igor Stravinsky, are perhaps two of the most famous; the latter, with choreography by the legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, caused a furor at its inception by virtue of its outrageous costumes, unusual choreography, bizarre story of pagan sacrifice, and Stravinsky’s musical innovations, all of which tested the patience of the audience to the extreme. “My hope at the symposium is to recapture something of the excitement of the premiere, by thinking about the context in which the Rite’s first audience experienced it,” Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music Thomas Forrest Kelly notes of “The Rite of Spring.” “The cultural context of Paris in 1913, the context of the Russian Ballet, the context of the ballet within the program of the evening…It was deliberately ‘primitive’ and ethnographic, and Diaghilev hoped it would shock. The Rite was positioned for a riot.”Perhaps most relevant to the “ingénue” America was Diaghilev’s fateful acquisition of a new, young choreographer named George Balanchine, who would later come to America and revolutionize ballet with the founding of the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet and a style of movement totally new neo-classical, despite its Imperial roots. This one man would transform American dance forever.The symposium features a starry list of illustrious guest speakers, panelists, and moderators that includes Joan Acocella, staff writer for The New Yorker; Anna Kisselgoff, former chief dance critic at the New York Times; former New York City Ballet dancer Toni Bentley; and current Boston Ballet director Mikko Nissinen, as well as Harvard faculty and visiting professors of history, music, and drama from colleges around the globe. Lecture topics range from “Fashion for Russia” to “Balanchine and Massine” and “Igor Stravinsky.” In addition, an exhibition, “Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, 1909-1929: Twenty Years that Changed the World of Art,” has been organized by the Harvard Theatre Collection at the Pusey Library, which features more than 200 original documents and art works and is free of charge and open to the public. On April 16th, the OFA Dance Program presents “Dancers’ Viewpointe 9” at the New College Theater, featuring student dancers and choreographers, as well as Associate Artistic Director and Choreographer of Ballet Nacional de Mexico Jaime Blanc’s own “Rite of Spring.”“Harvard, as you know, has an extraordinary range of scholarly and research based resources.  It is also an institution with the unique capacity to convene experts from around the world to discuss and examine a broad range of intellectual and creative interests,” OFA Director Jack Megan says. “The Ballets Russes symposium speaks to all of these strengths.  It engages important scholars, dance critics, and artists in a discussion about one of the most innovative artistic enterprises of the 20th century. It draws upon the incredibly rich resources of the Harvard Theater Collection, which help to inform that discussion; it engages some of our most wonderful student performers through the OFA Dance Program. It connects deeply to scholars in the Music Department.  “In short, it demonstrates the creative power and insight that this university can bring to bear when unique resources in various pockets of the campus reach out, connect and collaborate.  I expect that there will be much more of this type of thing in years to come.”For those curious enough to venture outside of the Yard, a weeklong Boston-wide Ballets Russes festival running from May 16 through 23 will include a concert by the Boston Pops, exhibitions at the Wadsworth Athenaeum and Boston University’s 808 Gallery, film screenings at the Museum of Fine Arts, performances at New England Conservatory, and a special program from the Boston Ballet, featuring seminal Ballets Russes works like “Afternoon of a Faun,” “Le Spectre de la Rose,” and a new “Le Sacre du Printemps” by celebrated contemporary choreographer Jorma Elo.Of Boston Ballet’s contributing gift, Press Director Mariel Macnaughton explained, “It’s definitely a retrospective program. The spirit of the Ballets Russes was the nature of Diaghilev’s forward thinking: being inventive and creating something new. Now we are honoring that. It’s great to look at it as something that looks back and also forward.”“The Ballets Russes provided one of the great moments when the arts came together to produce things greater than any one of them could provide alone,” Professor Kelly says. “The individual works are treasures, the historical phenomenon is fascinating, and this symposium and exhibition provide a great way to see what art is for, what it can do, and why it matters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every now and then—perhaps in the midst of a bout of insomnia or perhaps with premeditation—we might indulge in the gory, campy, low-budget magnificence of the zombie movie. Ever since George A. Romero’s release of “The Night of the Living Dead” in 1968, the zombie movie genre has attracted a cult following all its own. Over the years, the slow-moving, heavily made-up zombies of the classic black and white horror films have transformed into the disease-crazed, CGI-enhanced undead of modern-day thrillers such as “28 Days Later.” Though zombies have become progressively more physically complex throughout film history, the mystery hiding behind those ashen complexions in the mind of the undead still remains unclear. However, Coolidge Corner Theatre’s Science On Screen program will address this bloodless brainteaser on April 13 when it reveals an empirical explanation for zombification.The Science On Screen series focuses on films and documentaries that have a distinct, intriguing, or comical connection to areas of scientific inquiry, and it invites noted scientists and other academics to explain the science behind the screenings’ subjects. Next Monday, the theatre will screen “The Night of the Living Dead” with an introduction given by Dr. Steven C. Schlozman.Schlozman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a lecturer at the Harvard School of Education, is interested in links between the medical field and pop culture, the humanities, and the arts. In his introduction, Schlozman will explain the zombie in terms of neuroscience to answer some of the many pressing questions about zombies: why the uncoordinated movement? Why the lack of cortical function? And, most importantly, why so hungry?Using his own “brilliant formula” for zombie movies, Schlozman says he can predict the plots of most offspring of “Living Dead.” The similar trajectories of these films tend to begin by introducing “the motley crew of survivors” as an unlikely bunch of heroes. They coincidentally meet in some benign location—a mall, a house, a hospital—after which they “wall up” in order to protect themselves. Bored with their surroundings, the characters enter a downward spiral to violence; this “descent” is characterized by tension within the group, which manifests itself in aggression far more intense than that exhibited by their undead counterparts. At the “throw-in-the-towel” phase, the survivors risk death to escape their confines; in the process, they attempt to kill as many zombies as possible. At the film’s conclusion, the remaining characters are “rescued” by some government agency or army.Schlozman suggests that what makes the zombie genre so alluring is not just its fantastical elements, but also its ability to question the human experience. Zombie movies, he says, confront the natural propensity to empathize with human-like figures. “They address the big existential questions: what makes one human? Not human?” he explains. Schlozman also notes the moral lessons implicit in these movies. They warn of radiation risk and the dangers of conducting experimental tests on diseases; they offer a satirical commentary on governments that stand idly by in the midst of an apocalypse; they blatantly attack the emergence of materialistic tendencies even under dire circumstances.While Scholzman seeks to interpret the psychology of why viewers keep watching zombie films, he also gives thought to the neurology of zombies. According to Schlozman, because the hypothalamus stimulates the drive to forage, zombies’ eternal appetite and fleshy diet should be related to a problem with this part of the brain. Those exploding heads probably indicate that the zombies must suffer from a condition that induces severely increased intracranial pressure. And though they make for entertaining movies, the same cortical defects that would likely cause their lack of coordination and mindlessness also cause the zombies to be devoid of emotion—just in case there was any doubt that they would make bad movie-watching partners.

Two large pieces of paper face one another in artist Sanford Biggers’ studio at Harvard. On one wall hangs the sketch of a cross-section of a slave ship (“I have no idea what that’s about,” Biggers says). On the other, a piece of brown wrapping paper lists some of Biggers’ current projects: a multi-venue installation in Philadelphia that will trace locations from the Underground Railroad, a sculpture and floor design for a new high school in the Bronx, a series of dance vignettes based on a performance Biggers presented to the Dalai Lama.It’s no surprise that Biggers has been called a sculptor, a performance artist, a video artist, and an installation artist—or that his art has been qualified as both Dada and post-minimalist. His work consciously eludes labels. It is at once formal and multidisciplinary, static and interactive. “I am interested in making stuff that I, and other people, can’t categorize,” he says. And as Biggers engages the viewer with innovative forms, he asks them to consider the very basis with which they understand his art.Born in Los Angeles in 1970 and currently based in New York, Biggers has exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide, including the Whitney and the Tate Modern. This semester, he teaches two Visual and Environmental Studies classes as a visiting professor: “Objects and Environments” and “Spatial Poetics.” In addition, as the Marshall S. Cogan Visiting Artist in the Office for the Arts public art program, Biggers is conducting research for a temporary installation on the Harvard campus next semester. The project, he says, is “top secret” for now, but it will likely include participation from members of the Harvard community.Interactive art is no new endeavor for Biggers. The objects in Biggers’ art are only part of the final product; only when they interact with their environment can his art come to completion. “The space becomes charged by the exchange between viewer and object,” Biggers says. References to “power objects”—objects enlivened with energy—abound in his work.In his installation, “Mandala of the Bodhisattva II,” Biggers fashioned a floor after a Buddhist mandala, a spiritual emblem, and then asked break dancers to perform on it. In “Hip Hop Ni Sasagu (In Fond Memory of Hip-Hop),” he staged a chorus of orin, traditional singing bowls, in a Japanese temple. These orin were made from melted hip-hop jewelry. “My artwork provides a locus for the interaction and the evolution of culture—our experiences, our communication about it, how it affects us when we leave the room,” Biggers says. And as the object interacts with its environment, it also interacts with the viewer, who is both a witness and a participant. “I like to put the onus of the experience on the viewer,” he explains. Such interaction is both physical and intellectual. His 2001 installation, “Sticky Fingers,” features a large bed covered in a faux-fur blanket—evocative, Biggers says, of contemporary representations of “pimp” culture. Viewers were invited to sit down or lie on the bed. By the time the viewer-turned-participant gets up to leave the gallery, “The work,” Biggers says, “has touched them. Literally.” At the same time, Biggers’ pieces demand a mental engagement from the viewer. The headboard used in “Sticky Fingers” was a large Afro Pick entirely covered in leather, its top curled into a Black Power fist. Viewers interpret the work depending on their prior understanding of these symbols and their implicit meanings. “We only understand anything from our experiences,” Biggers says. And when viewers bring their diverse experiences to their interactions with artwork, the result is often surprising, even for Biggers. He recounts one installation of a boat-like structure filled with books, which, for him, played with the metaphor of a slave ship. Instead, many viewers saw the piece as a metaphor for freedom. “They found meanings that I did not even know,” Bigger says. “I realized that it was more interesting to have a multivalent operation where the viewer is accountable for part of the meaning.” Accordingly, Biggers sees his work as questioning rather than didactic. “I can’t assume that everyone is going to get the same thing from a work,” he says. “The work is open. Pointed, but open.”—Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz can be reached at mschwart@fas.harvard.edu.

Halfway through “The Posthuman Dada Guide: tzara and lenin play chess,” one may indulge the urge to turn to the Internet to help explain Andrei Codrescu’s looping chain of definitions, anecdotes, and exaggerated statements about the world. The entries that compose Codrescu’s “guide” are thick with allusions to forgotten female poets and obscure psychedelic rock bands. It’s hard to read them without wanting to know more, especially with little prior knowledge of Codrescu’s main focus: the 1920s cultural movement Dada.But further research only confounds points that Codrescu seemingly asserts with authority. The critical blurbs at the beginning of the book—“This book made me feel naked, and that’s one thing I know,” from “Josephine Baker, ‘Bronze Venus,’” for instance—are completely fabricated. Codrescu shows little regard for facts, suggesting a subversive component to a superficially academic exercise. An idea that he attributes to one Renaissance philosopher may belong to another. It’s not even clear whether the narrative skeleton of the book—a chess game between Tristan Tzara, Dada creator, and Vladimir Lenin, Communist leader in 1916’s Zurich—ever really occurred.“The Posthuman Dada Guide” is destabilizing and it’s meant to be. Codrescu both writes about Dada and writes in the Dada style, so, in the spirit of his nonsense-brandishing predecessors, he uses absurdity to shock his reader out of a dangerous mindset of logic and reason. But caught in the fetters of fact, Codrescu is unable to completely release himself into the meaningful randomness of Dada. Instead, his “Guide,” comes across more confused than absurd. Codrescu offers the reader “Dada” as mankind’s salvation but never actually hands it over in either a practiced or studied form. According to Codrescu, we need to be rattled from our current “posthumanity”—a state of being ruled too much by reason and not enough by human vigor. We are posthumans because we live through technology, because we create virtual avatars, because “the city, the house, the car, the iPhone, the laptop, the iPod, the pillbox, the nonflesh” have become alienated vehicles for ourselves. The fear of posthumanity may seem a little exaggerated (haven’t humans always interacted, in some way, with the tools of their creation?), but for Codrescu it carries more serious implications. Inherent to logic and reason is the possibility that rational thinking will lead the unquestioning to disaster. Posthumanity means a loss of humanity, and without humanity, there’s little regard for other human (or posthuman) beings.For Codrescu, the possibility is more immediate than one might realize. World War II shadows Codrescu’s eccentric anecdotes. One entry, titled “jews” discusses how anti-Semitism became grounds for scorning Dada artists, even when they weren’t Jewish. Mentions of the Holocaust run through Codrescu’s scattered writing. When he pits Lenin and Tzara against each other in a chess game—the symbols of humanity and posthumanity, respectively—Codrescu never proclaims the victor, but the suggestion is pretty ominous.Codrescu makes the claim that Dada’s overt absurdity may be an antidote to a life absurdly full of reason “The posthumans lining the road to the future (which looks as if it exists, after all, even though Dada is against it) need the solace offered by the primal raw energy of Dada and its inhuman sources.” His entries about moments (“1915, winter, Zurich”), concepts (“audience”), and people (“Tristan, Tzara”) burst with the raw energy he demands. Dada artists themselves provide most of the fun. Tzara once unraveled a roll of toilet paper marked “Merde” to end a performance and Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven wore a birdcage as a hat to parties. Codrescu amplifies their liveliness with his tight, brisk sentences: “In Sparta, bored out of her mind, the baroness sneaked off to Cincinnati by train to model nude at an art school.”   What Codrescu doesn’t explicitly mention, however, is that the tension between posthuman and human is itself a Dada construct. Dada grew out of a disgust at the slaughter of World War I; the impulse to negate all culture was an impulse to break down a society capable of such carnage. Dada art (Codrescu’s book is all words) often took images of technology and applied them to human forms—a reaction, to be sure, against the “posthuman” soldiers who returned from home, unrecognizable from the horrors of war. Codrescu hesitates to clarify such a fact because, despite his book’s claims at a “Guide,” it never actually commits to directing the reader one way or another. His book is designed to amuse, not to inform. Early on, Codrescu expresses a desire to generate Imagination Units (IUs), ideas which will thrive long after the content of the book has melted from the reader’s mind. The idea, while appropriate in the context of Dada, seems misapplied in his work which, however whimsical, relies on specifics more than style. Ultimately, Codrescu’s “Guide” stumbles on its own conceit: Dada prose written by an academic. It’s too scholarly to be absurd, too absurd to be edifying. Unwilling to fully embrace fiction or reality, “The Posthuman Dada Guide” chooses to undermine both. Maybe this is the most Dadaist way to deal with the future—to propose that neither knowledge nor art can save us from our own mistakes.—Staff writer Madeleine M.

Ask any tyke on the playground what a fairy tale is, and any of the following phrases might turn up: princesses, singing mice, mermaids, fairy godmothers. Fairy tales are defined by magic, which is why Kurt Scwhitters’ clever but often unimaginative book “Lucky Hans and Other Merz Fairy Tales,” newly translated by Jack Zipes, contains only two or three real “fairy tales.” The rest is a dark medley of fables, tall tales, parables, and even word games—all of them dark, most of them with unhappy endings.Fairy tales do not have to be lighthearted. In “Bluebeard,” one of the oldest and most famous fairy tales, a young woman discovers a secret room full of the corpses of her husband’s former wives. The original “Little Mermaid,” by Hans Christian Andersen, finds Ariel’s less-lucky predecessor forfeiting her life to save her prince. In the Grimms’ fairy tale, Cinderella’s stepsisters mutilate themselves in order to squeeze their feet into the glass slipper. The grim plots and endings don’t negate the fact that they’re all magnificent stories. The problem with Kurt Schwitters’ Merz stories is that they seem to rely on their darkness as a sufficient claim to artistry.The only apparent theme linking together the Merz stories, and the only conceivable reason why Zipes—a fairy tale expert—would claim in his introduction that they are subversive or unconventional, is their insistence that not everybody gets a “happily ever after.” That is all very well—and appropriate, since Scwhitters wrote them during the Nazi regime—but the question arises as to what about that fact warrants a collection devoted to these tales. Stephen Sondheim used the same theme in his 1986 musical “Into the Woods,” but he also incorporated comedy, nuance, and innovative new plots beyond “what happens after happily ever after” to create an imaginative musical drama. For Schwitters, whose multivalent creative drive yielded art across the spectrum of media—from painting to collage to sculpture—perhaps the fairy tale simply wasn’t his most interesting or effective venture.As it is, some of the stories read like thinly-veiled editorials, with grotesque characters set in realistic places and situations. In the story “He,” a giant joins the army, where his size affronts his superiors and they arrest him for insubordination. The rest of the story revolves around the inefficacy of military bureaucracy, as the officers attempt to build a prison large enough to house the growing giant. Almost everyone dies by the end of the story. Many writers have used fiction as a vehicle for political protest—take George Orwell—but at least they create compelling characters or futuristic worlds, or use talking animals as allegorical stand-ins for statesmen.Schwitters relegates the element of magic in his stories to exaggeration in the form of the grotesque and macabre. Again in the introduction, Zipes argues that the presence of these motifs make Schwitter’s stories fairy tales. But Zipes is mistaken, for they also appear in other genres, such as the Gothic story. Schwitters occasionally does borrow bits from conventional fairy tale plots, but he’s unable to employ them creatively. For example, the heroine of “The Proud Young Woman” rejects all her suitors—like the Princess and the Pea—but unlike the Princess who is wonderfully reformed by the trick her suitor plays on her, the proud young woman gradually grows old and ugly and dies. No fairy tale fan wants to read a story like that.Schwitters’ collection is at greatest fault, not in its mislabeling, but in its lack of imagination. The intelligence at work behind these stories is generally apparent, but this fact outpaces creativity more often than not. Their existence seems contingent on Merz (the movement Schwitters founded in 1918—and his pseudonym during his life—that paralleled many of the ideas of Berlin Dada), rather than a strong contribution to its corpus. The language lacks distinction, the plots are sometimes nonexistent and more often overly didactic, and the symbols are tired. For example, in “The Little Clock Spirit and the Lovers,” a couple is disturbed by the thought that time is passing, which is symbolized by—you’ll never guess—the ticking of a clock.For an idiosyncratic artist who created his own genre of art, Schwitters brought disappointingly little to the literary table with his fairy tales. Still, “Luck Hans” is not without its merits. Not surprisingly, the highlight of the book is visual rather than literary. Schwitters uses bizarre illustrative typography to narrate “The Scarecrow.” Though the story itself is not much more than a complicated “The House that Jack Built,” its innovative conversion of language into visual art strongly represents Schwitter’s definition of Merz, which “wants freedom from all fetters in order to shape things artistically.” All things considered, however, it seems there was a reason why Kurt Schwitter was remembered for his art, while his stories were, as the dust jacket says, “little known in any language” before now.—Staff writer April B.

Dear Ms. Laura Miller—About five and a half years ago today, I read an article of yours in the New York Times Sunday Book Review. Unlike the usual stuff of newspapers, which people read on Monday and by Sunday have moved on from, your article has had unusual staying power. In fact, it has remained with me, it has haunted me, until today—for six years of my total of 20, about a third of my lifetime! But today, today, I am going to exorcise your ghostly grip.You see, in the article that you wrote so many years ago, you put forth a claim that has bothered me, a self-identifying reader (and sometimes, in my more self-indulgent and pompous moments, a self-proclaimed bibliophile), ever since. If I recall rightly, in that notorious article, you declare, “solitary pleasure is...the only real reason for reading.” You eviscerate the straw men who expound reading’s defense in such terms as Daniel Adler’s high-handedly repulsive “we can learn only from our ‘betters’” (the authors of the great books of literature), or Arnold Weinstein’s laughably reductive “the bookshelf is as basic a resource for body and mind, especially the body and the mind in pain, as the medicine shelf.” You tear down those scarecrows with good reason; no one in their right mind would stand up to defend the arguments as you present them. But to write that pleasure is the only reason to read literature? That there is, ultimately, no social good to be derived from it? That Harold Bloom’s cantankerous—I think you use the word “imperious”—nature, that he is a grumpy old man, proves that the routine of reading does not make one a better person? To thus write off the whole endeavor as merely a pleasurable exercise seems wholly precipitous, even ignorant. (Though, of course, the fact that I’m writing you rather indignantly, and perhaps rather imperiously myself, having nurtured this grudge against your article for a third of my life, does seem to support your argument that, despite all of the books I’ve consumed for pleasure and, slightly less pleasurably, for my classes in high school and college, my basic character has not been done much good).  However, I want to say that my reading has, in fact, benefited society, or at least it has benefited you. I’m writing to you. I haven’t shown up at your house to duke it out, to resolve this difference between us with fist, or knife, or gun. I want to discuss this matter.And perhaps it is this circumstance that offers a faint idea of the social good that reading does. It acculturates an individual to discourse. To read fiction is to be exposed to a polyphony of voices, to engage with a multitude of perspectives, to imaginatively interact with places and people beyond one’s lived experience. In short (to put it reductively and to make a reductive argument in response to what I see as your own), reading equips its practitioner with the tools of democracy: a sense of curiosity, an ability to imagine beyond one’s own isolated experience, and a respect for language and communication.And I’m not alone in these crazy thoughts! The historian Benedict Anderson postulates that it was the shared sense of the world inspired by the common reading of newspapers that led to the social units that became the various American nations. And Richard Rorty, that intellectual juggernaut, makes a compelling, if slightly idealistic, case that novels, in eliciting sympathy from their readers for protagonists, play a key role in training individuals to exercise the sympathy necessary for solidarity in modern heterogeneous society. Another of your compatriots at the Times wrote an article with a similar take away point about how novels and social rationales don’t mix, how they’re like oil and water, called “You Read Your Book and I’ll Read Mine.” Well, you can read your book and I can read mine, but I’ll be reading with the world. Ultimately, I don’t think you can read by yourself or that you can read just for pleasure. When you read, you’re engaging with the world whether you like it or not. Simply to enjoy a book you have to translate the words on the page into a world of your own. And, as certain people like to write, language is always social, a structure that man is forever bound up within. To read you have to enter a world of intersubjectivity, where your understanding and the novelist’s mix and meld. Even when you make your way through a literary land as fantastically removed as Middle Earth or Tlön, you’re still walking in the middle of social discourse. So, Ms. Miller, I don’t know how you can really read solitarily, but you can try if you like.— Sanders Bernstein —This column was a response to the column “The Great Books Workout” by Laura Miller, which appeared in the September 7, 2003 edition of the New York Times Sunday Book Review.—Staff writer Sanders I. Bernstein can be reached at sbernst@fas.harvard.edu.

This past Sunday, the media were allowed to cover the return of a fallen U.S. soldier for the first time in 18 years. The ban on coverage of such ceremonies, in place since it was imposed by the first Bush administration in 1991, was drafted under the pretenses of privacy and respect for the families of the dead. More recently though, the ban has been widely criticized as an attempt to mask the cost of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Politically speaking and for the sake of public awareness, many of us are glad to see this ban lifted. However, in a society that has already been desensitized to death and violence, and which revels in the public exposure of all things private, I think that it is possible that our opinions on the issue have less to do with indignation about two wars and more to do with our warped, Web 2.0 understanding of privacy.During the Vietnam War, the nation’s first televised war, the American public was given essentially unrestricted access to how graphic and horrific war truly was. The propaganda newsreels of smiling soldiers and stereotyped enemies of WWII were replaced with the photographs, videos, and reports of embedded journalists, showing terrified young faces of American soldiers and piles of death wherever one looked. Until that time, the public’s overall exposure to that kind of violence had been limited to things like comparably tame horror movies, historical books about war, and sensationalist news stories about gangsters. Although the American psyche has probably always been just as obsessed with violence as today, viewers before the Vietnam era wouldn’t be able to get their fix of it from film and television then like they can now. When people saw the violence in Vietnam and the caskets coming home, the response was both shock and anger; it was these feelings that culminated in the peace movement that has been so emblemized in American history. What has changed since then?Everything. 24/7 news stations, the internet, satellite communications, digital photography, and a film and TV rating system that goes from G to NC-17 and beyond have transformed the world and the way it consumes and interprets information. The kind of violence that once shocked the audience of the Vietnam era is now funneled in all day and everyday. We live in an America where people will pay 10 dollars to watch a “Final Destination” movie and have a good time; for a little more, you can get video games in which you can deal drugs and kill prostitutes. We can sign up for breaking news updates on our cell phones, so we never miss a car chase or a police standoff.To say that Americans have become desensitized in the last 30 years is a cliché, but it’s true. This therefore raises the question: does the footage of caskets being pulled from cargo jets have the same effect that it once did? It will always be a painful, upsetting sight for those who see it, but perhaps it no longer can deeply touch a people who seem unmoved by anything short of a gun pressed to their head.If it can’t truly have the effect of promoting public awareness anymore, then what does lifting the ban really prove? On one hand, I think there has been a populist (and justified) desire to reverse many of the restrictions on freedom of speech and press resulting from America’s last two wars. On the other hand, I think our present understanding of privacy has created a sense of entitlement to what is traditionally considered the utmost private and personal aspects of our lives.Before the advent of digital cameras and the internet, photography was used for mostly personal reasons—pictures for a family photo album, for example. You might share the pictures with extended family or neighbors, but you didn’t leave the album in the local hole in the wall for everyone and their mother to see. Even the most invasive tabloid was limited by the necessity of sending a professional photographer to capture any newsworthy event.These days, many of us voluntarily do the hard work for the media. CNN has a virtual army of millions of camera phone-wielding viewers across the globe. Even without the prompting of CNN’s iReporter, the public today feels a need to expose every tabloid-worthy corner of our private existence. We blog, we post our entire lives on Facebook or Myspace, we whine about personal problems on Twitter, and we can forward a personal email to anyone we want in a second. We are our own paparazzi, and we have trampled the entire concept of privacy. We don’t only willingly reveal ourselves, but we have also come to expect it and desire it of others.This voyeuristic desire cannot help but influence our attitudes towards the returning of war dead. Do we really have the right to a moment that is so personally devastating to the friends and families of those lost? All egoism aside, would you really want the transfer of your body from the morgue to the funeral home televised? And our generation is perhaps the first in which this is not an entirely rhetorical question. With the bizarre public spectacle of Big Brother star Jane Goody’s death, the idea of a funeral webcast over MySpace seems ever closer.The lifting of the ban is clarified with a clause that necessitates familial consent to film and photograph. This concession to privacy gives me hope that the lifting of the ban is a step forward instead of one backwards. Perhaps it will be those families who say “no” to the media that will truly catch the attention of an America that has forgotten what privacy means.—Staff writer Andrew F.

It’s night, and Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler sits alone in the backseat (appropriate!) of a moving taxi. He’s singing the lyrics to “Windowsill,” which, like so many of the other tracks off 2007’s “Neon Bible,” strike a world-weary tone. “I don’t want the salesman knocking at my door,” Butler intones. “I don’t want to live in America no more.” Right on cue, the cab stops for a red light right next to a Best Buy store, and its glowing sign floats in space next to Butler’s countenance. Even as he laments the cultural deadening of that old-time American religion—namely, consumerism—one of its emblems pops up, neon-bright, just through his cab’s window. It’s a perfect moment; except, the scene ends what amounts to a 70-minute advertisement for Arcade Fire. “Miroir Noir,” Vincent Morisset’s new Arcade Fire concert film, combines scenes of the band’s performances and offstage antics with bits of found footage. The film is padded with fan testimonials, recorded on a hotline set up before the release of “Neon Bible”; these constitute a self-deprecating acknowledgement of the erstwhile indie darling’s mainstream windfall. But while it hastens to assure fans that the band hasn’t really changed, the movie’s many ambiguities frustrate that impulse. Morisset, who helped shape the viral marketing blitz for “Neon Bible,” struggles stylistically. “Miroir Noir” often adopts a vérité approach. The final scene’s a nod to online indie concert series Black Cab Sessions, and many scenes capture the band members in the middle of rehearsals and downtime, in hopes of emulating the free-wheeling performances captured by Paris-based La Blogotheque’s Take-Away Shows. Yet the band members never let their guard down—they’re always performing, even during candid moments, sprinting up and down hotel hallways, putting on both literal and figurative masks. Maybe it’s the old observer effect, but the viewer never gets a glimpse behind the band’s indie cutesy-pie veneer, and it always seems like the band members are performing scripted roles.Even these roles are equivocal. Butler comes off as, alternately, a revival preacher and wild-eyed revolutionary; either way, he exudes a scary amount of solemn zeal. His wife, multi-instrumentalist Régine Chassagne, gets some face time too—during which she never seems quite hinged, exactly. But for the most part, unless you really know the band members coming in, they remain mostly anonymous, faceless.That’s not entirely the film’s fault; it’s also the band’s. After Arcade Fire’s debut release, “Funeral,” appeared in 2004, music bloggerati instantly elevated the group to the indie pantheon. They did so because of the music, and when “Miroir Noir” sticks to tunes, it shines. Morisset captures some barn-burning performances; the selections from “Funeral” prove the album’s destined to last, and even the “Neon Bible” tracks tempt audiences into forgiving the album’s thematic and lyrical heavy-handedness. But their stage personae are similarly overwrought, and songs such as “Surf City Eastern Block” (which has Butler assuming an alter ego) maintain a distance between listeners and the band. During a stadium-show performance of “Neighborhood #3 (Power Out),” several of the group’s many members line up at the front of the stage to rock out. The moment calls to mind Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, right down to Butler’s vest, and the groups share a kindred spirit: both have shared a stage and a  belief in the possibility of rock and roll salvation. Certainly, there’s nothing inherently wrong with playing to giant sell-out crowds. But Bruce’s aesthetic never really militated against going mainstream, while the Arcade Fire seem anxious to retain their indie character. Springsteen’s politics prize inclusivity; Butler’s music has attracted the masses, but there’s a curious isolationism in not wanting to live in America no more.The pretensions of “Miroir Noir” do their best to keep populism at bay. Close-ups on a shaking door knob, bird’s-eye-views of street-level passersby, overblown anonymous calls (“I believe in myself, I believe in the cause, and I believe in the effect. I do believe.”)—they all make Morisset’s film and Arcade Fire a little less accessible. The group produces some fantastic music, but they too often resort to trading on their mystique. Their onscreen mawkishness and their fin-de-siècle peasant costumes cultivate an image designed to endear them to the white middle-class (it bears mentioning that the film’s only nonwhite characters are a quartet of black female singers hired to sing backgrounds on a track). Arcade Fire may not be in love with the modern world, but they’re still inescapably of it.—Staff writer Jake G. Cohen can be reached at jgcohen@fas.harvard.edu.

Since it first reared its head in 1977, punk rock hasn’t come in waves so much as infesations, swarms, plagues of cockroaches. When their way of life destabilized (post-punk, new wave, etc.), the faithful foraged underground to found hardcore—itself the ancestor of pop music’s most violent and dissonant iterations. The lineup and the skulls shaking in the crowd may change, but, beyond all hope and all disaster, punk rock survives.Its survival derives from its credibility, and its credibility, after more than 30 years, derives from its sense of iconoclasm. The underground history of punk is rife with bands that barely have any history at all; “true” punk musicians, to this day, revert to a sort of self-destructive loop of formation-creation-disbandment to avoid unwanted attention and the anathema of a “signature sound.” The idea of success is alien to punk rock, and simply not present in the lexicon. Bands that move forward—either creatively or commercially—must disown, and are disowned by, the localized and often incestuous punk communities they come from. But there’s a third direction, a direction that Portland indie-punks the Thermals have turned to with their fourth album, “Now We Can See.” That is, to put it bluntly, no direction at all.Since forming in 2002, the Thermals have enjoyed a relatively comfortable living on a fan base fattened in no small part by the Pitchfork phenomenon. Unique among the bands in that tent, however, the Thermals cultivated a certain sound of fetishized outrage that looked faithfully back at the examples set by the impassioned lyrics of Joe Strummer and the infectious hooks of Buzzcocks singles. Their first album, “More Parts Per Million,” anticipated the more recent insurgence of lo-fi punk (No Age, Times New Viking, Wavves) with surprising acuity, trading in primitive pop riffs and paper-thin anthems, all wrapped in a sheet of feedback. The difference between the Thermals and those bands is that feedback was less a symbiote than the sound of growing pains. By the band’s second album, “Fucking A,” the outfit was tighter, the choruses were clearer, and most importantly, you could hear every pseudoliterate word leader Hutch Harris had to wail about. Lyrics painted a vague portrait of self-righteous rage and apocalyptic rebellion; Harris’s was the language of inarticulate teen angst projected on a romantically nihilistic worldview. They could be embarrassing—and, to be sure, sometimes downright stupid—but the only lyrics that could belong to music this catchy were inanely simple.Harris’s distinctive yelps, razor-sharp guitars and a minor hit single, “How We Know,” paved the way two years later for the success of their third, and best, record, 2006’s “The Body, The Blood, The Machine.” In retrospect, that record seems a success more in spite of itself than anything else: the predictably facile “concept” of the album—a desperate romance in a post-apocalyptic dystopia—is kept at bay by irresistibly catchy tracks like “Here’s Your Future,” and “An Ear for Baby.” And though the songs all sounded the same, they all sounded great.It speaks volumes, then, to say that their follow-up, “Now We Can See,” is the kind of flop that its predecessor could have been, if not for a mixture of pure ambition and pure luck. Where the lyrics could be ignored on their last album—or allowed to fade into the mix as a sort of campy soundtrack-to-a-soundtrack—the Thermals have made them the centerpiece here; something vaguely about reflections of life after metamorphosis and death in the ocean, but honestly who cares? Much of the guitar work seems warmed-over from their last record—and the one before that, and the one before that. While innovation was never the band’s strong suit, some thematic variation would be appreciated.But like every seasoned pop band, the Thermals have a few gems to salvage from the wreck. The sloppy, manic “When We Were Alive” shakes with the same bracing fury—noisy riffs that fall like axe blows over gleefully deranged vocals—of earlier releases. “How We Fade” glimpses at those heights as it surges to a close, and in its valleys it remains a passably pretty stab at punk balladry. The album closer, “You Dissolve,” finds the band remembering how to be mindless without being mind-numbing, which is more than can be said for the likes of “Liquid In, Liquid Out” and the title track, the latter of which boasts a pretty irritating wordless-cheering section in lieu of a chorus.So the Thermals find themselves on the long road through self-parody. It’s difficult, at first, to listen to a band squander the potential of a record like “Machine” on such a middling follow-up. But then again maybe, in appropriately punk fashion, they only had one great record in them anyway.—Staff writer Ryan J. Meehan can be reached at rmeehan@fas.harvard.edu.

Though singer-songwriter Cris Williamson is being honored this week with a three-day residency at Berklee College of Music, she can still recall a time when her work remained considerably underappreciated. “People listened to [my music] and said, ‘Well, that’s just beautiful music. We don’t know what to call it though. If we don’t know what to call it, we can’t sell it.’ I was abandoned,” Williamson says.With a lack of support for her musical endeavors, Williamson took the self-motivated route and became a pioneer of independent music. “I like it. It’s freedom. You don’t have to depend on the big boys—and they’re boys, all right,” she says, alluding to the male-dominated mainstream music industry that unsuccessfully manipulated and ultimately rejected her in the 1970s.Highlights of Williamson’s trailblazing music career were shown last Wednesday at a free screening of “Radical Harmonies,” a Dee Mosbacher-directed documentary depicting the inception and growth of the rarely publicized women’s music movement. “Like a lot of women’s work,” Williamson said, “it went unseen but not unsung.”In 1973, the singer’s talent and vision prompted her peers to seek financial and artistic independence from the industry. Her suggestion of an all-female record label culminated in Olivia Records, the first company of its kind. The unprecedented success of Olivia Records’ artists and those of similar labels led to the first female-only concert events, like the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, which debuted in 1976, predating Sarah McLachlan’s Lilith Fair by two decades. Wednesday’s screening was followed by a public panel discussion featuring Williamson, Associate Professor of Voice at Berklee Didi Stewart, and Rhiannon, a performance artist also prominent in the women’s music movement. During her residence, Williamson will attend classes and students’ performances, but she plans to strike a balance between the roles of teacher and student. “It doesn’t interest me to be the person who owns arcane knowledge and keeps it to herself…as if that were an advantage,” she says.“I’ve always had the desire to be a teacher. There are teachers that can just strike you down... I don’t think that’s useful,” Williamson says. Inspired by a fan who asked her to write a song about abuse, Williamson regularly offers songwriting workshops, advising her students to “come from the personal, [and] aim for the universal.” She’ll be conducting a similar workshop for Berklee students.Before being contacted by Berklee, Williamson had been “filling up the well,” collecting material for future work. “I’m writing my memoirs, whatever it is I’m able to remember,” she says. Still, she’s glad to offer her wisdom to students. “I’m feeling very honored to be there,” she says. “I just have my head down, working most all of life and every now and then you raise your head up and people go, ‘We love what you do, will you come do that over here?’ [I’d] love to.”Regarding the current music scene, Williamson says, “I’m not listening much to anybody right now. I’m writing a lot… I need to hear what’s going on in my own head.” Even so, she can’t ignore the sweeping changes that her efforts in the women’s music movement initiated. “I think that women standing up for themselves has crept into music,” she says.She also realizes that several boundaries remain in the way of musical liberation for women. “Sex sells… so they say. To me, it just kind of looks ridiculous,” she says. “It’s always been there, it probably always will.” Yet she remains hopeful about the future of women in music. “Women have supported my work for many years now, and my work has supported them. That, at least, is a fair trade.”

If Neil Young wants to release a concept album about eco-friendly cars, he sure as hell will—and over 40 years of artistic excellence means that people will listen, regardless of its merits. “Fork in the Road,” although appreciable for its grungy, hard-rocking feel and often hilarious, sometimes thought provoking lyrics, leaves the listener feeling unnoticed as Young continues to write songs that seem to serve the sole purpose of amusing himself for the moment.Ever the “Godfather of Grunge,” Neil Young incorporates in his latest album sounds that are most reminiscent of his 1981 record “Re-Ac-Tor,” but at “Fork’s” best moments, one is reminded even of his 1975 “Zuma,” in its use of lyrical yet powerful riffs. “Fork in the Road” opens with “When Worlds Collide,” announced by sets of heavily distorted guitar chords, the garage-rock sound of which feels appropriate given the album’s focus on cars. Most of the songs feel like they should be played full-volume while driving with the sunroof down through deserted highways of the Mid-West, rocking some shades, all the while bobbing along to the rhythm.This playfulness comes through in Young’s lyrics as well. The album’s title track, released in January this year with an accompanying video of Young playing air guitar to the song and wearing earphones that connect up to an apple—get it?—is a great example of his sense of humor. “Got a pot belly,” sings the musical legend, but he adds, “it’s not too big.” Nonetheless, when Young growls in the same song about getting his recently purchased flat screen “repo’d” and missing the Raider’s game, the listener is reminded that “there’s a bailout coming but it’s not for you / it’s for all those creeps hiding what they do.”Though Young’s humor shines through at times, his intent throughout the album is mostly political. Like his 2006 record “Living With War,” the lyrics read as impassioned, sincere, but largely unpolished and impromptu ravings. Songs like “Johnny Magic” may have momentary relevance, but they sometimes seem like little more than soapbox speeches: “In the form of a heavy metal Continental / She was born to run a proud highway,” sings Young. The songs lack the timeless wisdom and emotional vulnerability that we know Young is capable of, and attempting to excuse superficiality by defending the album as a fun one is futile. There’s no fun in wondering, “Where did all the cash flow? / Where did all the money go?”Nonetheless, listeners who yearn for the softer Neil Young can find solace in tracks like “Off the Road” and “Light a Candle.” Their lighter instrumentation, the latter featuring just Young and his acoustic, work to highlight the complex vocal harmonies that were present throughout the album. Young’s uniquely fragile and charming voice shines through, honorably affected by time.Instances like this, in which Young exchanges nagging rhetoric for blunt vulnerability are rare, but rewarding. And though he has his heartfelt moments, it may not be enough to compensate for sitting through an album that seems to have largely ignored its audience’s desires—“Fork in the Road” notoriously postponed the much-awaited release of Young’s archival recordings among its other arguable faults.But Neil Young has indeed attracted a fan base that will remain loyal to him no matter what sudden impulses he may follow. While Young’s latest “Fork in the Road” will not affect his career one way or another, it is unlikely to be a timeless benchmark in the Neil Young canon.

“Examined Life,” points towards the days of Socrates, not only in its opening lines—Socrates’ famous defense “The unexamined life is not worth living” reaffirmed millennia later by the booming voice of Cornel West—but in its recreation of a world where philosophers wandered regularly among market places and stone forums. Eight of today’s most prominent thinkers are set loose from their offices and classrooms by director Astra Taylor to roam the sites of daily life—airports, parks, Fifth Avenue. While the philosophers’ ruminations lose their grounding in academic method, the liveliness that takes hold of their ideas more than makes up for the loss, making “Examined Life” 87 minutes of excitement for the mind—with plenty of food for thought left for the walk home from the theatre.The 30-year old Canadian writer/director Astra Taylor has used the medium of film to explore philosophy before. In her 2005 documentary “Žižek!” she followed Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek on his lecture tour, and he makes an appearance again in “Examined Life”—along with seven other modern thinks, including University of Chicago professor Martha Nussbaum, “Empire” author Michael Hardt, and feminist post-structuralist Judith Butler. Despite her experience, Taylor reveals her anxieties about making philosophical film in a conversation with NYU professor Avital Ronell, the first onscreen thinker after “Matrix Revolutions” celebrity-philosopher Cornel West.Philosophical thinking has traditionally taken place in the written form, which gives both its deliverer and its audience enough time to explore ideas in-depth and parse out the details of the arguments. Taylor is justified, then, in the fast-paced aspect of her endeavor—with only 10 minutes to talk through their ideas, none of these thinkers are about to make a philosophical break-through. Ronell tells a helpful anecdote about Heidegger’s abandonment of what he believed to be institutionalized philosophy in favor of simply thinking. Indeed, Taylor’s film presents nothing like a close reading of “Being and Time,” but it does rouse its viewers to consider various takes on what it might mean to be alive today.Walking down 5th Avenue in New York City, Princeton’s Peter Singer asks, “Can we make our academic studies more relevant to our questions today?” as he applies ethical theory to the affluence around him. His idea that what we spend money on affects what we don’t spend money on—saving lives, for example—relates closely to Ronell’s considerations of morals in a potentially meaningless existence and cultural theorist Kwame Anthony Appiah’s thoughts on what it means to be a cosmopolitan in an ever-shrinking world. Indeed, part of the success of “Examined Life” comes from the flow and interaction between each of the philosophers’ ideas, even though they never meet face-to-face.Taylor includes known rhetoricians such as West and Žižek in her line-up of all-star thinkers, and they do not disappoint. West is the only figure who appears more than once in the film, and his musings are dispersed throughout. “I’m a jazz man in the world of ideas,” he says, sitting in the back seat of a car driving through New York City, his astounding breadth of knowledge and poetic name-dropping engaging, if not inspiring. Žižek stands in front of a garbage dump wearing a bright orange vest, excitedly ranting about ecology in a counter-intuitive way. “We must find poetry—spirituality—in this dimension,” he says. “To recreate, if not beauty, then aesthetic dimension in trash.”The strength of “Examined Life” is that it also allows philosophers less public than West or Žižek to bring their ideas to life. Butler, for example, known for being difficult on paper, emerges here even more engaging than West. A thinker in feminism, queer theory, and ethics, she shows up sporting a baggy leather jacket and an equally loose style of talking. Accompanied by Sunaura Taylor, the filmmaker’s disabled sister, Butler strolls around San Francisco considering traditional Western conceptions of a body—the pitfalls of having “an ideal morphology… [of] what a body should look like, move like” and whether we really live in a world where we assist each other. This discourse is all the while exemplified as they visit a second-hand clothing store to pick out a new sweater for Sunaura. “This is going to be a new show: ‘Shopping with Judith Butler,’” Sunaura quips. “For the queer eye,” Butler gamely adds as she winks at the camera.“Examined Life” is filled with many such animated and appealing moments, affirming Taylor’s implicit premise for the film, West’s declaration that “there’s ascertainable pleasure in the life of the mind that cannot be denied. You’re intensely alive!”

The Seth Rogen Cinematic Formula is usually pretty reliable—he gets into ridiculous situations through some indirect fault of his own, he gets high, he finds love by being himself, and in the end, his good-natured smirk ensures that everything works out and he can go on being a slob or slacker or some variation of the lazy man’s dream. It’s easy and effective, the movies are funny (in a witty way that is both naïve and worldly at the same time), and the formula has worked for him thus far. His latest film, “Observe and Report,” however, is like the evil twin of all his other feel-good movies. Rest assured, it has all these elements and more, but it takes them to an unexpectedly darker, more disturbing, or simply more obnoxious level than moviegoers may be expecting. “Observe and Report” follows shopping mall cop Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen) as he embarks on a mission to catch a flasher who preys on unsuspecting women in the mall parking lot. When Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) from the local police is called in to take over the case, Ronnie increases his efforts whilst trying to impress the cosmetics sales assistant, Brandi (Anna Faris from the “Scary Movie” series). Along the way, he must also find time to fall in love, kill a few cocaine dealers, and attempt to achieve his dream of becoming a police officer.Those expecting to see Rogen in another cute, bumbling, well-meaning role will find themselves disappointed, and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Observe and Report” shows a more daring and wicked side to Rogen’s lopsided smile, something akin to but more extreme than his role as a rogue police officer in “Superbad.” Ronnie cusses like a sailor, gets high at work, and is mean to the one girl who tries to treat him like a human being. Rogen also pulls off Ronnie’s delusional arrogance without sacrificing his goofy awkwardness in more romantic scenes; at one point, Ronnie asks Brandi out by touching the top of her head and quipping, “You, me, free dinner... you fill in the rest with a yes.” With its meandering multiple plot lines, the film ends up very much like its main character: bipolar, aimless, and shameless. “Observe and Report” fails to make up its mind as to where it should place its focus, zigzagging between characters and events. As a result, the movie seems a little disjointed at times, pausing on extreme high-angle close ups of Ronnie’s face as he contemplates his life, before moving to hand-held shots that follow him as he runs after terrified skateboarders in the parking lot. “Observe and Report” attempts to squeeze in a few moments of genuine warmth into the mayhem, but Ronnie’s alcoholic mother (Celia Weston) sucks them dry like she does her whiskey. Before Ronnie goes out on a date, she tells him about her first date with his father, reminiscing, “He was so handsome... I knew right then and there that I would fuck him that night.” By contrast, Nell (Collette Wolfe), a crippled coffee shop server, plays a more human, likable, and sympathetic character, even if it remains unclear why she insists on liking Ronnie in the first place. Surprisingly, “Observe and Report” scores high on shock value in several moments, featuring explicit (and often cringe-inducing) nudity and visual violence. As Ronnie takes down six crack dealers on a dark corner with a single stick, the camera immediately zooms in on a dislocated joint and shows Ronnie kicking a thug’s already bloodied face in excruciating detail. The grim violence and dark humor contrasts well with the sterile surfaces of the mall and the masses of robot-like shoppers who constantly pass in the background. It also represents a more irreverent and bolder kind of comedy. Some of the shots are indeed very cheap; the blatant racism between Ronnie and a Middle Eastern salesman and the band of misfits that make up Ronnie’s security guard crew (complete with a Hispanic second in command, incompetent Asian twins, and a shy redhead) are nothing new. The choice to use Faris as the tarty cosmetics saleswoman who throws up pink vomit is also somewhat predictable, but her brand of “Scary Movie” shamelessness only adds to the two-dimensionality of the mall’s world and Ronnie’s sense of mall-cop ennui. Ronnie’s moment of self-realization—marked by his dramatic declaration that “The world needs a fucking hero”—falls a little flat in this loosely sewn comedy, which is more enjoyable for its unexpected dark turns than its punch lines. In the end, everything turns out the way it should, and Ronnie can go on being an arrogant, power-hungry mall cop, but you may leave the theatre feeling that he hasn’t really learned anything or changed in any major way. What may have changed, however, is the way people think about Seth Rogen films and the darker, grittier shapes that “Observe and Report” lets loose on the comedic film landscape. —Staff writer Jenny J.

I bet you never thought you could like Mike Tyson. Fallen pugilist who destroyed his career, convicted rapist—not to mention an ear-biting demon in the ring—Tyson has a bad rap. Societal mores of compassion advocate human understanding in the face of seriously bad behavior; they tell us that people are complicated, that we should delve beneath the surface of society’s most troubled and attempt to connect. But for most people, the only way to interact with such a terrifying person is superficial at best.Documentary filmmaking provides the opportunity to truly deliver someone else’s reality, even if that person is as seemingly insane as Mike Tyson. James Toback ’66 is particularly attuned to this power. After Harvard, he went on to become a highly controversial Hollywood screenwriter and director, meeting Mike Tyson on the set of his 1985 film “The Pick Up Artist.” There they began the friendship that would finally yield Toback’s most recent film, “Tyson,” a documentary that peels away the seemingly infinite layers surrounding the legendary boxer, revealing an alarmingly human specimen coiled in its center. As in his fictional films, Toback is slow to reveal the psychological interior of his controversial protagonist. “This sort of ‘let’s root for this guy’ in movies as if it were a baseball game has always struck me as a kind of truly low-brow notion of what art is supposed to be,” Toback says. “What happens with the most interesting works of art, I think, is that you start with a sense of deception, of half-knowledge, preferably with the deck stacked against your protagonist, and then in the course of whatever you’re watching or hearing, you gain a greater, deeper understanding of who that person is.”Toback, like his subject, has something of a bad reputation. Associated in Hollywood with drug cults, hustlers, and gangsters, he makes no attempt to hide his own vices. His first feature film was called “The Gambler”; he penned the screenplay for “Bugsy”—the Oscar-winning 1991 film about celebrity gangster Bugsy Siegel’s ventures in Vegas—and he wrote and directed “The Harvard Man,” a semi-autobiographical account of an epic sophomore year LSD trip. According to Toback, when Tyson first met him, he recognized him as “that white guy in the middle of the orgies at Jim Brown’s house.”  Somewhat ironically, Toback awards Tyson a gaze he has no desire to direct toward himself. “I don’t give a fuck,” Toback says, when asked about his own image. “Life is too short to worry about your enemies or the people who don’t understand you.”“Tyson” stemmed from the mutual understanding between Toback and Tyson of the multiplicity of voices within the mind.  This is “madness” rather than schizophrenia, according to Toback, who talks openly about his experience with LSD that left him both “enlightened” and permanently haunted. This parallels Tyson’s traumatic three years in prison, after which he was left with an acquired split-personality. The film mirrors this confusion stylistically, using split-frames and multi-layered images during interviews to create a sense of interior chaos. While Toback’s adventurous editing does create this feeling, it also prevents narrative clarity by too aggressively emphasizing Tyson’s jumbled mental state. The film does, however, grant Tyson the chance to tell his own story in the presence of someone with whom he is comfortable. Through the help of incredible archival footage of fights and anecdotal interviews, the audience gains access to lingering memories of Tyson’s fragility, the true measure of his talent, and the forces beyond his control that unfairly contributed to his downfall—his violent childhood in poverty and the emptiness that followed his short-lived glory. Five minutes later, however, Tyson regresses to his familiar routine. “I’m a beast. I’ll eat his children. Praise be to Allah,” he spews, and we’re back to square one. Throughout the film, Tyson appears on his white leather couch with leopard-print pillows, talking breathlessly about his Brooklyn childhood, where a trip to juvenile detention was “like a class reunion.” He tells some funny and heartbreaking stories about protecting pigeons he was caring for from his friends. Despite the laughs, though, Tyson comes off as self-indulgent and overly eager to paint the unfortunate surroundings in which he grew up. Toback claims this was strategic, causing the audience to be directly confronted with their dislike toward Tyson, then allowing it to erode as he breaks down and wins their compassion.“Maybe you don’t end up loving him, but you end up understanding him in a way you didn’t at the beginning,” Toback says. “That, really, is what I was hoping—not that I would redeem Mike Tyson in the eyes of the public, but rather that people would say, ‘This is a far more complicated and fascinating person than I had ever imagined.’”—Staff writer Mia P.

If you’ve been holding out for the day that “Superbad” is remade as a melodrama, your day has finally come. Greg Mottola, who directed the 2007 hit summer comedy about two virgin high school seniors getting drunk and looking to get laid, doesn’t exhibit much originality as the writer/director of “Adventureland,” the sentimental tale of a virgin college graduate getting drunk, stoned, and (surprise) trying to get laid. “Adventureland” does boast some funny characters and a killer soundtrack, but the plight of the protagonist is taken too seriously, and “Superbad” fans might be disappointed to see the fun they love drained by unconvincingly tragic elements.James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) is planning a summer Euro-trip with his affluent roommate before he packs his pencil for Columbia’s journalism school. Catastrophe strikes, however, when Dad is demoted and can’t foot the vacation bill. For the first time in his life, James has to find a job. No self-indulgent European jaunt for him—just Pittsburgh, tiny paychecks and “the work of pathetic, lazy morons.” James despises his job at Adventureland Amusement Park, but his summer brightens when he meets smart, funny co-worker Em Lewin (Kristen Stewart, “Twilight”). The film tries to tackle more adult themes, such as true love and marital fidelity, but it retains a high school level of maturity in which boner jokes and punches in the nuts abound. Although the characters are allegedly four years older than the high schoolers of “Superbad,” they still binge drink until they puke, and there is little to distinguish Eisenberg’s awkward and soft-spoken virgin from that of Michael Cera (other than the fact that Eisenberg has a car to drunkenly drive into the neighbor’s hedge). When Mottola presents a 22-year-old who expects an expensive summer vacation and four years of graduate school on his parent’s dime while he gets high and drunk daily, it is easier to feel compassion for the parents.The movie heads downhill when Em finds out that James kissed an attractive co-worker, James discovers Em has been sleeping with the married park mechanic, and Mottola asks us to stop laughing and start crying. “Adventureland” wants to explore the commitment struggles of two genuinely attached adults, but the theme park setting feels like a middle school as rumors bring about the breakup of the popular couple. “Superbad” succeeded because it laughed at the blatant immaturity of its protagonists and through that managed to arrive at a kernel of emotional charm. “Adventureland,” by contrast, never reaches this same endearment, though it aims more directly for dramatic conflict. Because the movie is set in a world of young adults rather than adolescent kids, it’s difficult to sympathize with James and Em’s irresponsibility.The supporting characters and classic, youthful music keep the film enjoyable. Bill Hader (“Pineapple Express”) deepens his niche as hilarious bit actor with his role as Adventureland’s park manager, whose cool demeanor hides a violent inner aggression. His “Saturday Night Live” co-star Kristen Wiig makes confused faces with the best of them as his spacey wife. The most loveable character could be Joel (Martin Starr), the bespectacled and barely mustachioed carnival stand attendant who considers himself less of a Jew and “more of an atheist, or existential nihilist.” At one point he hands his favorite piece of Russian literature to his romantic interest and explains that the author later went insane and committed suicide. While the rest of the principle characters act with egocentric ingratitude for what they have, Joel stands firm as the unlikely moral bedrock of the story.In the film’s attempt to bridge adult drama with juvenile comedy, its one unequivocal success is the versatile soundtrack. The movie implies a setting in the 80s with a single shot of Reagan on a television screen, but period choice seems merely an arbitrary excuse to pepper the film with great songs from the era, including David Bowie’s “Modern Love,” The Cure’s “Just Like Heaven,” and The Outfield’s “Your Love.” The wistful pop of these years accompanies Mottola’s use of frequent pans and circling close-ups. The songs speak to carefree satisfaction as much as they hint to nostalgic sadness in the face of fading youth.Just as the promises of adolescence gradually wither, the movie loses steam as it recedes into melodrama. When James applies to work at Adventureland, he asks for a job in rides but the manager hands him a games job instead, informing him of the cardinal rule of games: “Nobody ever wins a giant-ass panda.” Mottola handles his “Superbad” fans similarly; they’ll expect a cinematic carnival ride but they’ll leave having paid 10 dollars for a subpar attempt at rewarding entertainment.

Last Saturday, the Institute of Contemporary Art presented “Design as Social Agent,” a series of talks and discussions led by notable graphic designers that identified this profession as being at the crossroads of art, society, politics, and the law. Inspired by the work of artist Shepard Fairey—best known for his “Hope” poster featuring President Obama—the day-long lecture series provided historical, theoretical, and practical insights into the relationship between design and society. The lectures ranged in subject matter, from the ways in which the Obama campaign used design to the controversy surrounding intellectual property that was sparked by Fairey’s use of an Associated Press photograph in his “Hope” poster.Steven Heller, who has acted as an art director at the New York Times for 33 years, provided a historical view of the role of propaganda in dictatorships in “Iron Fists: Branding the 20th Century Totalitarian State.” Heller pointed to Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin as examples of the first politicians whose photographs were airbrushed extensively by graphic designers. “Mao never brushed his teeth, but in photos his black teeth were always pearly white,” Heller said.Heller also described how Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini both used graphic designers to promote “the cult of the kid.” In Fascist Italy, youth was idealized: posters which depicted virile young men and women were the cultural advertisements that championed this ideology. In his research for a book on the subject, Heller even came across the Nazi “branding manual,” a handbook with instructions including how to appropriately use the swastika and represent the Jewish people. “Without graphic designers, the Holocaust would not have happened,” Heller said. “I guarantee you that.”The concluding panel for the series was a discussion in which four speakers addressed a topic with great import for the future of graphic design: the politics and aesthetics of appropriation and the exact definition of “fair use.” Heller was joined by Nicholas Blechman, his successor at The New York Times Book Review and creator of the acclaimed fanzine, Nozone; Elliott Earls, an avant-garde graphic designer and professor at the Cranbrook Academy of Art; and the panel’s moderator, Kevin Grady, editor of the award-winning pop culture magazine Lemon. The panelists expressed contrary views on the subject, which sprung from generational as well as political differences. Heller, after a 35-year career in graphic design, argued for a pragmatic approach. “Designers have always had influences and inspirations,” he said. “As long as you alter or add to the source work in some fundamental way, it isn’t stealing.” Nicholas Blechman diverged in his stance, presenting his reasoning from the point of view of Mannie Garcia, the AP photographer whose photo Fairey used, without giving Garcia credit. “If I’m Mannie Garcia,” Blechman said, “and I wait all day to take the perfect picture of Obama, and then see it all over the place in this poster, I think that’s not right.” Earls offered another opinion, which framed the debate in near-Marxist terms. “If you’re someone who is disempowered, who has less cultural status, then I think appropriation is alright,” he said. “But if you are in a position of greater power, exploiting someone with less cultural status, it isn’t.”Ultimately, the panelists agreed that, at the very least, Fairey’s “Hope” poster has had a significant positive impact on American society. The debate on this frequently overlooked aspect of graphic design illustrated the often thorny nature of design as social agent, and the tension that can arise when the morality of society comes into conflict with the morality of art.

Tintoretto—a nickname meaning “little dyer” after his father’s profession—was the eldest of 22 children (his father must have been busy with more than staining wool) and is one of three Olympian daubers of color on canvas whose works fill the superb exhibit of 16th century Venetian painting at the Museum of Fine Arts. This show, “Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese: Rivals in Renaissance Venice,” on view through August 16, brings together with rare serendipity an embarrassment of stunning paintings on loan from museums around the world. This triumvirate of Venetian painters seems to engage in a pictorial brinksmanship, each work one-upping the last: Titian’s consummate composition and beauty, Veronese’s ebullient gatherings of pastel-clad figures, or Tintoretto’s brilliant challenges to the status quo.The exhibition begins at a turning point in the history of painting, with the shift from wood panels to stretched canvases as the substrate for the painted work. The contrasting pair that opens the exhibition juxtaposes a Titian canvas with an earlier Bellini panel of a similar scene, a virgin surrounded by saints. The smooth surface of the polished wood panel and the carefully hidden brushstrokes give the Bellini its placidly silken, liquid surface, and even its painted and columned frame recalls the Italian High Renaissance; but the rougher surface of the canvas seems to free Titian to make visible his brushwork and lend his gilt-framed work a subdued and textured frisson. Titian dominates this first room of the exhibition, and his remarkable portrait of Pope Paul III introduces the psychological depths that set off these Venetians from their southern predecessors. The pope sits in a sea of faded velvet—his mantle and his chair—a fading man himself, not proud, with slightly bowed shoulders. His hands have a vitality and firmness that is balanced against his reticent, or perhaps suspicious, visage; the portrait recognized the inner life of its subject, which was something almost entirely new. Earlier, Michelangelo’s unfinished statues of slaves for the tomb of Pope Julius II also begin to reveal the psychological turmoil of their subject, but this Venetian school takes the artistic display of psychological depth to the next level, with massive canvases of deep emotional power, making possible the work of El Greco and Caravaggio.The exhibition is not arranged by strict chronology but rather thematically, and the most central room is devoted to erotic works (the room is entered past a kitschy cloth of red brocade that is tied back from the entrance by a gold cord). Here, the three artists explored the female nude in biblical and classical scenes charged with sexual tension. For me, the two paints that dominated the room were Tintoretto’s “Susannah and the Elders”—surprising in its serene, almost art nouveau beauty and flatness of color and pictorial space—and Titian’s “Danaë”—the finest of multiple versions of the same scene. “Danaë” shows the rape of the mother of Perseus (voluptuously spread on a coach) by Zeus, who has transformed himself into a shower of gold coins—a 24-carat money shot—to seduce her. The scene clearly had intense popular attraction, and transgressive erotic appeal, and one contemporary remarked that this version made one of Titian’s earlier editions of the scene look like a portrait of a nun. Where these artists made their fame and their fortunes, however, was with large-scale religious works for Venice’s hundreds of churches, and apparently there was no contradiction between painting a Last Supper on Tuesday and a sexually charged nude on Wednesday (though it seems like Martin Scorsese filming a porno). Through all of the rooms, the intense rivalry between these three painters is brought out through skillful curatorial design; a striking pairing of “Last Suppers” shows the differences between Titian and Tintoretto. While the Titian is beautifully composed and rich in detail, the Tintoretto is a parody of Titian’s scene. All of the figures surrounding Christ are looking away from him, and the colors are muddy and the brushstrokes rough, as if flipping the finger to his older rival. Moving through the exhibition, each artist seems in turn to outdo his rivals, producing works of ever-greater beauty and power—and yet, at the end, it is Tintoretto who seems, if not the most supremely skilled, the most challenging, inventive, and creative of the triumvirate.Tintoretto’s canvases occasionally verge on the ugly with deeply shadowed figures, violent brushstrokes, garish colors (a glowing turquoise matched with a browning plum in “Esther Before Ahasuerus”), and unsettling compositions. And yet, even more than Titian and Veronese, Tintoretto seems to constantly challenge and evolve, moving from a Bellini-like beauty to the glowing and ethereally evocative religious figures of his later work, which prefigure El Greco. Perhaps it was intentional that Frederick Ilchman, the show’s curator and a preeminent expert on Tintoretto, constructed the exhibit to make Tintoretto seem the most inventive and original of the three. A youthful and fiery self-portrait by Tintoretto helps anchor the first room, and the last painting is a solemn and piercing-eyed self-portrait of the aged dyer’s son, emphasizing his importance and bookending a rare and incredible exhibit. —Staff writer Alexander B.

Imagine your family, the jobs you’ve had, all of the friendships and relationships that have come and gone in the last 20 years. Now imagine that chunk of your life being ripped away from you for something that you did not do. For many unfortunate individuals, this was a horrifyingly true situation. Erik Jensen and Jessica Blank’s “The Exonerated”—which is making its Harvard debut this weekend—follows the experiences of six people convicted of crimes they did not commit, only to be released years, even decades, later—after their lives have already been irreparably damaged by their time in prison.“The Exonerated,” which has garnered various awards since its premiere in 2002, will be performed by BlackCAST in the Adams Pool Theatre through Sunday. Co-directed by Renee Michelle Ragin ’10 and Jenne B. Ayers ’10, “The Exonerated” explores real, personal stories. “This play is less about the death penalty and more about the human experience. People shouldn’t be coming in tense and worried about having an opinion,” says Ragin.Each of the six individuals’ stories contains similar, overlapping themes—such as hope and redemption in the midst of such a trying ordeal—and their individual narratives are knit together in vignettes that follow their respective arrests, interrogation, incarceration, and eventual exoneration. The theatrical presentation of these paralleled stories questions the presence of justice in the American legal system, while also delving into meaningful moral issues in a more personal and accessible way.“The more I think about the play, the more I realize it has a lot of things to do with perceptions of people—how negative perceptions or stereotypes can lead to horrible things,” Ayers says. “That kind of issue should not be visited on a superficial level.”The Adams Pool Theatre creates a close environment in which to relate people’s personal stories in a deep and effective way. Using spotlights to focus on the character who is speaking at the time, “The Exonerated” is performed simply yet profoundly in this antiqutated theater that the staff decided would be perfect for the atmosphere it exudes.  “We wanted to use the Adams Pool Theatre, because it is an intimate space. We wanted the audience to feel the essence of the story,” says Odelia S. Younge ’11, one of the producers for the show. “It’s such a simple production; it’s really all in the words of the script. The stories speak for themselves. The play has a lot of power in that it is so simple.”Constructed from real interviews, case files, and public records, “The Exonerated” clearly explores the appalling consequences of false accusation. It appeals to a variety of emotions as diverse as the cast itself, balancing both grief and humor in the plot. “Even though it is a touching play that even moves me to tears in certain parts, it’s not intended to depress or have you come away with a particular thought about the penal system,” Ragin says. “There is a huge range of emotions in the play.”“The more rehearsals we do, we see humor come alive in places that you wouldn’t expect. It doesn’t feel stagnant—we try to reinterpret the monologues,” Ayers adds. “We even tried to say a certain word with different inflections, and even those slight changes made a huge change.”The main objective of “The Exonerated” is to reach beyond the confines of fictional drama and tell more than just a story. The work strives to provoke critical thought about the death penalty and its ramifications, issues that are pertinent to present-day U.S., one of the several western countries still using capital punishment as a form of retributive justice.“This is a story of how the legal system can get it wrong sometimes, and this is the worst case scenario of how innocent people became damaged because of their time in jail,” Younge says. “As college kids on campus, we should be aware of these issues, even if they don’t specifically relate to us.”The cast and actors of the play hope to use the power of their production to make students fully aware of these difficult issues. “If [‘The Exonerated’] just feels like a play after you see it, we haven’t done our job,” says Ragin. “This is a real issue that affected real people. It is an artistic representation of something that is real. Next time an article or something on this comes out, we hope people are looking at the issue in a deeper  way.”

Chemical agents found in many institutional cleaning supplies may pose a health risk to hospital workers, according to a pilot study done by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Harvard’s School of Public Health.
The study, published in last month’s issue of Environmental Health, was carried out at six eastern Massachusetts hospitals.
“The reason we started this study was that we received concerns from clinicians, housekeeping staff, and nurses about various cleaning agents,” said lead researcher Anila Bello, a research fellow in exposure and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Some hospital workers had said that they had experienced exacerbated asthma symptoms, while others complained of skin irritation.
Researchers sought to identify ingredients in glass, bathroom, and general-purpose cleaners that may cause respiratory distress and skin irritation and then gauge the potential for exposure to these ingredients during common cleaning tasks.
Examples of these problem ingredients include quaternary ammonium compounds, 2-butoxyethanol, and ethanolamines, said Bello.
In addition to the specific chemical ingredients, cleaning techniques also affected the severity of the reactions.  
Bello and her team looked at the relative exposure to chemicals during a variety of cleaning tasks. The study concluded that “high exposure” jobs include tasks that require a variety of products used in succession, such as cleaning bathrooms.  
“Aerosol cleaners and cleaning tasks that involve application over large surface area are some of the most hazardous in terms of the highest exposure,” said Margaret M. Quinn, a member of the research team who is a professor at the UMass Lowell. 
Though this study made no conclusions pertaining to patient health risk, the researchers have also carried out a study that shows that the organic vapors from cleaning products do hang in the air for sometimes 20 minutes or more, which create a poor indoor environment, Quinn said.   
While more research is needed, there are steps that hospitals and other institutions can take to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals. 
“Things that could be done are to avoid spraying when possible,” Quinn said. “Wiping is better than spraying, any thing that aerosols should be avoided. Also, have ventilation is important.” 
Hospitals can also switch to more environmentally friendly, “green” cleaning products, which are safer and have fewer hazardous ingredients, said Bello.

Infants who see rapid growth in the first six months of life may be at a significantly higher risk for obesity later on, according to a Harvard study published in the April issue of Pediatrics.These results imply that obesity can be rooted in the very early stages of life, according to Elsie M. Taveras, the study’s lead investigator and an assistant professor at the Medical School.“Some think, ‘oh, it’s just baby fat, it’s cute, it’ll go away,’” Taveras said. “Our results will be surprising to people who thought there are no consequences for a chubby baby.”Taveras said she understands that, upon learning the results of the study, parents would immediately begin worrying that their children were growing abnormally.“I’d recommend that mothers not necessarily worry,” she said. “These are questions for the pediatrician to determine.”The main implication of this study is that rapid weight gains early in life are significant and are associated with later obesity, according to Sheryl L. Rifas-Shiman, a research associate at Harvard Medical School and one of the article’s authors.“[Early life] might be a critical period that health professionals and researchers should focus on,” said Rifas-Shiman.Although previous studies have found evidence linking rapid weight gain in infancy to a greater risk of obesity later in life, this study analyzed growth rate more precisely, monitoring weight-to-length ratio over the first six months.According to Taveras, the weight-to-length ratio, akin to the body mass index in adults, is a more accurate indicator of body fat than weight alone.The study showed that rapid rises in weight-to-length ratio increased the risk of later obesity from 20 to 40 percent, a risk Taveras called “not insignificant.”Clifford W. Lo, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical School, said he saw “several ramifications” of the study’s results.“Something is happening within the first year or two of life that has long-term effects,” said Lo, who is also an assistant professor of nutrition at the School of Public Health. The next step for researchers, Taveras said, is to isolate the cause for the sort of rapid infant growth that can cause problems.“It could be overfeeding, it could be factors that arose before the child is even born, it could be genetics,” Taveras said. “We don’t have all the answers for parents yet.”The recently-published study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was conducted by researchers from Harvard Medical School, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and Harvard-affiliated Children’s Hospital in Boston.The data from 559 mother/child pairs used in the study was collected from a subgroup from Project Viva, which has been following over 2000 pregnant women recruited in the first trimester of their pregnancy since 1999.—Staff writer Helen X.

A team of Harvard researchers have identified a potential method for treating Huntington’s disease that might shed light on treatments for similar neurodegenerative diseases.The team—led by scientists at the Harvard-affiliated MassGeneral Institute For Neurodegenerative Disease (MGH-MIND)—identified a novel mechanism of clearing disease-causing mutant huntingtin protein from brain cells by modifying the protein structure for autophagic degradation, a natural degradation process in cells.  The introduction of a specific molecular fragment known as an acetyl group into the mutant proteins—a process also known as acetylation—is the key to triggering the destruction of excess huntingtin, according to the findings, which were published in the April 3 issue of Cell.   “The novelty of our research is that it links acetylation to degradation, which hasn’t been shown before,” said Dimitri Krainc, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and practitioner at Massachusetts General Hospital, who was involved in the research. Krainc said acetylation of the Huntingtin protein could be made more efficient through medication, leading to quicker degradation of the mutant protein, and potentially relief from the disease. Common symptoms of Huntington’s—an inherited disease affecting about 30,000 people in the United States for which there is no known cure—include uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual faculties, and emotional disturbance. Current compounds used to increase acetylation lack the specificity that would be necessary to create a safe and efficient medication, Krainc said.“What we need to do is to find a version of these inhibitors that are more specific for Huntington’s,” he said.According to Krainc, the study of the accetylation of certain proteins known as histones has been on-going for 40 years, but little is known about the same process in non-histone proteins like huntingtin. Krainc said that the recent study was taking research on Huntington’s in a new direction—targeting the source of problem. “There are treatments that are symptomatic, but not targeting the source,” Krainc said. “It’s like when you have a cavity, you take a pain killer, the pain will go away, but the cavity is still there.”The new study was ground-breaking partly because it has implication for the treatments of other neurodegenerative diseases, Krainc said. Krainc said that the accumulation of proteins is a “common theme” among all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The hope, he added, is to find more specific drugs that will ablate mutant proteins.—Staff writer Gordon Y. Liao can be reached at liao@fas.harvard.edu.

When cancerous cells form a tumor and begin to grow uncontrollably, they need to induce the formation of new blood vessels to bring them oxygen and nutrients—a process known as angiogenesis.A team of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital has discovered that the main effects of an angiogenesis inhibitor in treating glioblastoma, a severe kind of brain tumor, stem from the reduction of brain swelling, rather than any effect on tumor growth.In these tumors, blood vessels can be leaky, which causes swelling in the brain known as edema. This, in turn, can cause drowsiness, loss of consciousness, and brain damage. A Phase II clinical trial with the experimental drug cediranib conducted several years ago showed that patients treated with the drug survived longer compared to historical controls. Researchers wanted to know why this occurred, said Tracy T. Batchelor, one of the authors of the study and a consultant to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, which produces cediranib.“This was a bench to bedside and back to bench journey,” added Batchelor, referring to the return to the laboratory after the drug’s clinical trial.The researchers used rodent models with three different kinds of glioblastoma and placed a window in the animals’ cranium so they could observe the brain tumor—which they labeled with a fluorescent reporter—while the animals were still alive.They found that the mice treated with the drug survived longer compared to controls given only saline, which mimicked what occurred in the clinical trial, said Rakesh K. Jain, director of the Steele Laboratory in the MGH Department of Radiation Oncology and a professor of oncology at Harvard Medical School.Yet surprisingly, the drug was not affecting tumor growth—the tumors continued to grow in mice given the drug, Jain said.“These treatments allowed animals to survive longer despite not slowing the tumor at all,” said Walid S. Kamoun, one of the lead authors and a research fellow in radiation oncology at MGH.Several years ago, Jain had proposed that anti-angiogenic drugs might be repairing the tumor blood vessels, which he called “normalization”.“This would reduce edema—swelling—in brain tumors,” Jain said. “Edema is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in these patients.”The researchers showed that this was indeed the case in their rodent models—the main effect of the drug was to normalize the blood vessels and reduce swelling, allowing the animals to live longer with the tumor, said Kamoun.“This was the first preclinical study to show that normalization of vessels alone without chemotherapy and radiation can prolong life,” Jain said.Currently, clinical trials using cediranib to treat patients with both recurrent and newly-diagnosed glioblastoma are underway in Boston and internationally to further study the drug’s efficacy.In the future, the researchers hope the drug can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation—both of which are more effective when blood flow to the tumor is normal—to enhance their effects on reducing tumor growth, said Jain.—Staff writer Alissa M.

he Harvard University Native American Program has appointed Shelly C. Lowe as its new executive director, effective beginning in July. Lowe is a member of the Navajo Nation and is currently an assistant dean at Yale College and the director of the Native American Cultural Center at Yale University. Carmen Lopez, also of the Navajo Nation, was the last HUNAP executive director, and her departure last year prompted a national search for her replacement. Associate Director for Recruitment and Student Affairs Steven Abbott has assumed the duties of the HUNAP Executive Director for the past year, according to Bryant Bonner ’09, president of Native Americans at Harvard College,“[Abbot] has done such a great job filling the gap of Executive Director, juggling two jobs between doing outreach to students and managing HUNAP,” he said. “So I am very excited about [Lowe’s] arrival.”Lowe’s first project will be overseeing evaluations of HUNAP programs, gathering data on the programs and soliciting input from students, faculty, staff, and alumni. She said that she would also like to encourage students to remain involved with the Native American community after graduation.“I would like to see a sharp increase in the number of Native graduates coming out of the Ivy institutions and going into leadership positions directly related to tribal needs and concerns,” Lowe said.Lowe also emphasized the importance of HUNAP to both Harvard and the larger Native American community beyond the gates.“I am very excited about working with HUNAP, because unlike NACC of Yale, HUNAP goes beyond the student affairs realm,” she said. “HUNAP also has a very distinct and identifiable name outside the University within the Native American communities and with other higher education institutions.”

When Boston City Councillor Sam Yoon ventured into residential Allston last night to meet with the Allston Brighton North Neighbors Forum, he was questioned about his fledgling mayoral campaign, his views on urban planning and Harvard’s Allston expansion, and his plans to shake up Boston’s government.
“I think we need to change politics in Boston,” Yoon said, referencing his unorthodox political background as a teacher and community organizer. “I don’t think that the politics we have now in the City, focusing so much on the exercise or use of power, is going to serve us for the future.”
Among Yoon’s specific targets for reform is the Boston Redevelopment Authority—the City’s powerful planning and development agency responsible for approving construction projects, including Harvard’s Allston Science Complex and future expanded campus. 
At the question-and-answer session held by the ABNNF at the Allston elementary school Gardner Pilot Academy, several local residents praised the BRA’s handling of the community-wide planning process.
“I think we’re doing really well with the BRA here, in large part because Mike [Glavin, the BRA’s deputy director for institutional development], is steering the process,” said Tim McHale, a Brighton resident of over three decades. “He’s between a rock and a hard place, Harvard and the City and us, but we think he’s doing a really great job.”   
At a Harvard Allston Task Force meeting in late March, BRA Chief Planner Kairos Shen committed to revitalizing the planning process for relocating the Charlesview Apartments and developing the Holton Street Corridor—two projects related to Harvard’s expansion that have been sidelined in recent months due to the focus on the Science Complex. 
Yoon, a Princeton and Harvard Kennedy School graduate, said that while he would never categorically criticize the BRA’s record, he does see the agency as excessively “linked to politics.” To make development a more “community-driven process,” he said that the BRA should be restructured—perhaps by separating the agency’s planning and development functions—in order to ensure that the voices of community members and developers are balanced.
“The BRA can be reorganized in that way, but it won’t happen so long as [the Mayor] is there, because it works for him,” Yoon said. “This is the one agency shielded from the City Council and any legislative body.”
But Jessica Shumaker, a spokeswoman for the BRA, said in an interview that planning, economic development, and workforce development are all critical components of a successful city, and that “having these three functions unified in a single agency enables each division to inform and enhance the work of the other divisions.” 
While Yoon emphasized his intent to overturn the Bostonian political establishment, a couple of community members questioned his spotty attendance record at neighborhood meetings. 
“You get up and say the BRA doesn’t work the way it should, and that’s confusing for me,” said Sal Pinchera, a local resident. “I wish you would have been at some of the meetings, and maybe you could have brought something to the table.” 
Yoon said he takes such concerns seriously, but also pointed out that his schedule is busy and that it is not his political style to attend meetings just to be recognized.
“I think there is a culture where it’s the showing up and showing your face that’s the reason for being there, rather than showing what you’ve been working on for change,” Yoon said. “Believe me, you’ve been in my thoughts.” 
McHale said the ABNNF hopes to bring all the Boston mayoral candidates to speak to the Allston community, and that Yoon was the first to make himself available.

The Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub opened the felt-rope entrance to its new outdoor patio yesterday afternoon under clear skies and in the midst of warm weather, a rarity of late.A cluster of round metal tables and chairs, sectioned off with rope, in front of the Pub’s outside entrance comprise the new seating area. Although it currently seats just over twenty, Pub Manager Joshua P. Woodruff ’11 said there is still room to expand.Both indoors and outside, students and administrators enjoyed the celebration at the Pub. Associate Dean of the College Judith H. Kidd, sporting a blue Hawaiian shirt and lei, spent some time behind the bar in support of the expanding pub.“I think it’s nice to add another dimension to al fresco dining to the Harvard Yard,” she said. “I’m all for it.” The atmosphere at the pub could only be described as business-tropic, with some donning suits and business attire and others opting for more festive Hawaiian shirts—but leis were all around. In addition to some complimentary refreshments, the pub also turned up the music a bit for the event.  Leah D. Seifu ’11 took advantage of the new outdoor seating to socialize with friends and enjoy some of the complimentary refreshments.“I think the patio is a great addition that provides students with an inviting place to hang out between classes or in their free time,” she said. Woodruff said the patio has been a long time coming and added that he is looking forward to the additional business it will bring.“The patio, something we’ve been talking about for years but just now got the permits for, will be open for full service, weather permitting, for all business hours of the pub,” he said. “In addition, the patio will be open every Thursday of summer from 4-10 for ‘Summer Thursdays.’” With spring on its way, The Queen’s Head hopes the patio will become a well-used space.“Boston weather’s not great, everybody knows that,” Woodruff said. “But there are those days when the weather is good, like today, and people will have the chance to enjoy them at the Pub now.”—Staff Writer Wyatt P.

A trial version of the University Library’s new search interface was released last week, featuring improvements like a simpler search box and expanded data breadth, according to Tracey D. Robinson, head of the Office for Information Systems in the University Library.  	The new version of the Harvard Online Library Information System—commonly known as HOLLIS—displays a color-coded “word cloud” that offers links to related search terms and a column that allows searchers to refine searches based on topic, format, language, and genre.“The Web search arena has been experiencing major changes,” said Robinson of the need for the modifications. “Search engines like Google Book Search and Google Scholar were gaining attention, and we felt that our online catalogue was looking antiquated.”The new system takes advantage of social-networking Web site features, such as options to tag items and write reviews, in an attempt to make the HOLLIS network more user-friendly, Robinson said.“In Hollis Classic, you had to explore more to get what you were looking for. Now, the expanded search is right at your fingertips,” said Laura F. Blake, the interim head of Research Services at Widener Library.While discussion about updating HOLLIS has been going on over the last two years, the University Library Office for Information Systems officially bought the new software only a few months ago. The HOLLIS Classic system, implemented in 2002, will remain in place during the testing stage of the new system.Released last week to librarians, and on Tuesday to the University community, the new system will be constantly updated based on feedback from users, Robinson said.By the fall of 2009, the new HOLLIS will allow readers to sift through different types of media—including visual, audio, and various archives—from a single search field. Currently, users must switch pages on HOLLIS to search different types of sources. “Our goal is to expand the scope of data, so you can have different sources made available to you in your search,” said Robinson.Students have commented on the new system’s visual appeal and search facility. “It’s important for Harvard to have a professional web presence,” said Lange P. Luntao ’12. “The old HOLLIS was not professional and seemed out of date.”But learning to use the new system may be difficult for frequent users of HOLLIS Classic.“The system has a learning curve,” said Blake. “The tool is more user-friendly for new users, but for those of us who have been using HOLLIS for years, including library staff, it is more of an adjustment.”

Despite increased awareness of environmental issues generated by “green” campaigns, policy on environmental change is moving slowly, according to three environmental experts who spoke at a panel hosted by International Relations on Campus in coordination with the Environmental Action Committee last night in Sever 113.The three experts tended to agree that the sluggishness on environmental policy derives from both discord among international powers and differing perspectives on how to handle the body of current environmental knowledge.Regardless of the fact that activists have been “yelling” about environmental issues for a number of years, “the yelling doesn’t get us anywhere,” said panel participant Timothy C. Weiskel, co-director of the Climate Talks Project and instructor in Harvard’s division of continuing education.Panelist William R. Moomaw, director of the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy at Tufts’ Fletcher School, said he attributes the slow speed of environmental policymaking to differing expectations from international actors.While China continues to make monumental strides towards a greener society, its neighbor, India, has not made significant improvements, he said.The panelists all praised China for its efforts in “greening” the country. According to Moomaw, China currently keeps track of a “Green GDP” and will have the highest production of solar panels by next year.“The global South expects more of the global North than they are willing to give,” added fellow panelist David Blackbourn, director of the Minda de Gunzberg Center for European Studies at Harvard.In addition, Moomaw stated that one hurdle to significant environmental progress comes from “scientific doubters” who believe that taking immediate steps to address climate change is unnecessary and potentially counterproductive without further knowledge. “But what they don’t understand,” Moomaw said, “is that learning and instituting regulation can go together.”Similarly, he claimed that the slow implementation of environmental policy stems from the influence of institutions such as the Heartland and Cato Institutes, which provide more conservative views on environmentalism.Moomaw said that although the negativity can be overwhelming, it increases environmental consciousness, which promotes knowledge and eventually, action.IRoC Co-Director Courtney L. Blair ’10 said she was happy to have been able to work with the EAC and thought the panel was successful.

Two Harvard affiliates were among the five Boston-area hospitals that received threatening letters Wednesday, a scare that prompted police and hazardous materials teams to rush to the scene.Police responded to reports of suspicious mail at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the early afternoon.All the envelopes delivered to the hospitals appeared to be from the same sender, but police found no trace of powder, according to media reports and the Boston Police Department’s online log.The exact intent of the letters mailed to the hospitals remains unclear, but no biological threat was found.Wednesday’s scare began after employees at New England Baptist Hospital noticed an envelope with excessive postage and suspicious-looking writing scrawled on the front around 10:47 a.m. The hospital notified police, which in turn warned hospitals in the area.Throughout the late morning and early afternoon—as hospitals scoured mailrooms for suspicious letters—other hospitals reported finding similar letters, triggering a flurry of hazmat team deployments to four other hospitals in the Boston area.The letters appear to be from by a patient advocate in Westborough, Massachusetts, said BPD spokesman David Estrada. According to the online log, the suspect is “a zealous advocate for patient’s rights and makes statements critical of the care provided by these hospitals.”No arrests have been made in the case so far, according to Estrada, who declined to comment on the details of the investigation.Although hazmat teams were deployed to Beth Israel to collect one of the suspicious letters, the hospital did not evacuate or suffer any disruptions in service, said Michael Keating, a spokesman for the hospital.Keating declined to comment on whether the hospital had experienced similar threats in recent years, citing hospital policy against commenting on security issues.Officials at Brigham and Women’s Hospital could not be reached for comment.Wednesday’s incident is not Harvard’s first run-in with suspicious letters this year.In late January, Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz received a letter containing a suspicious white powder, a threat that turned out to be a hoax.Since the anthrax scares of 2002, threatening mail has become a popular method for turning an innocuous letter into a alarming—if not always lethal—terrorism device.—Staff writer Elias J.

Over 500 students looking to study and work abroad this summer received notification Tuesday that they had joined the inaugural group of undergraduates to be awarded David Rockefeller International Experience grants.  The grants, administered though the Office of International Programs, are the fruit of a $100 million donation from David Rockefeller ’36, made specifically to fund “significant” international projects.  The determination of significance is a task left by the University to the OIP, which assesses how well student proposals adhere to standards for cultural immersion, faculty consultation, and curricular integration.According to Erin E. Goodman, the assistant director of the OIP and one of the grant program’s chief coordinators, 825 students applied for Rockefeller grants, which are available only for proposed projects lasting at least eight weeks. Of that number, 511 have been sent letters informing them of their grant award, with the possibility that some award recipients may receive late notification.  “Of the people that are not receiving Rockefeller grants, a significant number received funding from other sources on campus,” Goodman said, noting that her office reviewed proposals requesting anywhere between $600 and $20,000.   The actual amount awarded varied widely among students. Andrew R. Milewski ’12, a resident of Straus Hall, said he received $4,000 for his summer in Paris, while his roommate, Evan R. Czaplicki ’12, will live in the same city on only $1,500. “That covers plane tickets, essentially,” Czaplicki said.Both students said that their summer plans—for Milewski, work in a neurological research lab at the Université Pierre et Marie Curie, and for Czaplicki, language study at Columbia University’s Parisian campus—were entirely contingent upon receiving grant money. They also characterized their experience with the OIP as more confusing than constructive, with Czaplicki explaining, “In terms of choosing a program and figuring out what kinds of things I needed, they weren’t very helpful.”“They were helpful in directing me to different resources,” said Milewski. “I would go in and ask for help, and they would tell me things that I already knew.”Goodman said that in spite of the faltering economy, the budget for next year’s Rockefeller grants will not shrink, since the gift had been specifically tied to student travel.—Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

With Advising Fortnight nearly halfway over, Harvard freshman are now officially on the path to picking a concentration. But for the class of 2012, the choices available are a little different from years past—life sciences majors will find themselves with a new concentration to consider, while potential Classics concentrators will enjoy reduced requirements. Human Development and Regenerative Biology, approved by the Faculty Council last November, is the newest undergraduate concentration. A part of the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, HDRB which will become Harvard’s ninth undergraduate concentration in the life sciences and will be available beginning in the fall of 2009.The Classics department has also updated concentration requirements with its recently-adopted reforms that include eliminating general exams and having fewer language requirements.For department administrators, the key challenge may be to market these new options in a way that makes their fields both attractive and understandable for potential concentrators.HDRB representatives were present at the Advising Fortnight kickoff dinner in Annenberg Hall on April 6 to inform current freshmen about the new concentration. They will also participate in a Life Sciences Open House on April 13 as well as a panel discussion with Life Sciences Concentration Advisors on April 15.Elias A. Shaaya ’12, who is a Crimson editorial editor, said that he is considering concentrating in HDRB after learning more about the concentration during the Advising Fortnight kickoff. “I’ve always been interested in cell development,” he said, “And after talking to [William J. Anderson, SCRB’s undergraduate curriculum manager], I found it was a very well planned-out concentration. That got me to be more interested in it.” Helal Syed ’11, currently a Molecular and Cell Biology concentrator, said he hopes to transfer into HDRB next fall, although his plans are not yet certain.“The transfer shouldn’t be that hard,” he said. “Many of the classes I’ve taken will count for concentration credit because they’ve already been offering classes through the department that will count towards HDRB, like ones on stem cell biology.” The Classics Department has yet to make formal efforts to communicate news about the concentration requirement changes, as they are still waiting for official approval from the Educational Policy Committee, said department chair John M. Duffy. Veronica R. Koven-Matasy ’10, the Junior class representative for the Classics department, however, has been updating her fellow concentrators about these reforms via e-mail.Athena L.M. Lao ’12, a freshman who plans to concentrate in Classics, said that she learned about the upcoming changes through the Crimson and her TFs.“When the changes they have in mind are set in stone, I think it’s important they communicate them so people know what they’re getting into,” Lao said. Duffy said that he hopes that the changes will encourage freshmen to become Classics concentrators. But neither Lao nor Christopher J. McCarthy ’12, another prospective Classics concentrator, said these changes had any effect on their decision.“This is what I wanted to do for a while, and so the nuts and bolts of it are not much of a concern,” McCarthy said.Although Koven-Matasy remains optimistic, she does not think the new requirements will vastly change freshmen decisions.“There aren’t a lot of people on the fence about Classics,” Koven-Matasy said, noting, though, that these changes will make it easier for people to enter the concentration at a later date. —Staff writer Wendy H.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Cherry A. Murray was applying to college, she says her older brother, then a physics graduate student at MIT, told her, “There’s no way you can succeed in physics, and definitely not at MIT.” So she went to MIT. And majored in physics.Today she is a world-renowned physicist, president of the American Physical Society, and the incoming Dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, a role she assumes at time of great financial turmoil for Harvard’s schools.But colleagues say Murray’s take-charge attitude and experience in management at Bell Labs—where she served as a senior vice president while it was also experiencing budgetary woes—are strong qualifications for the challenge of building up the fledgling school in an era of restricted resources.“She was very bold in the kind of things she would do,” says Bell colleague David J. Bishop. “She won’t shy away from a fight.”Murray says she was drawn to Harvard in part with the aim of furthering the SEAS charge to provide its students with an interdisciplinary education, but adds she hopes to expand its reach to ensure all Harvard students graduate with a knowledge of science.“By and large, people who come through Harvard end up being world leaders,” says Murray. “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if they understood technology?” RISING THROUGH THE RANKS When Murray arrived at MIT, she says she was one of only three women in her physics class out of approximately 100 students—but that didn’t faze her. “At MIT you either hate it or you love it,” Murray says. “And I absolutely loved it.”Murray took readily to the experimental demands of applied physics, completing her senior thesis studying excitations in superfluid helium with physics professor Thomas J. Greytak, a difficult project that involved building her own homemade helium fridge.“The [parts] kept plugging up and there were several leaks and other excitements,” says Murray. “You actually had to make everything back in those days to do your experiments.”After completing her senior thesis, Murray was accepted to several graduate schools, but stayed at MIT, because all the others seemed “sleepy.”She continued working with Greytak on a surface physics experiment that required her to spend hours welding in the machine shop building a vacuum system.When she received an IBM Fellowship midway through her thesis work, she says she walked into Greytak’s office to ask if she should take the unorthodox step of interrupting her academic career for an internship in industry. “His reaction was kind of interesting,” Murray says. “He fell off his chair, and I thought, ‘Oh well, never mind that.’” But the next day, she says Greytak came to her office and told her she should intern at the prestigious Bell Labs, where he had done research as an undergraduate.The experience resulted in her joining Bell Labs as a member of the technical staff after she received her doctorate.“Bell Labs was a unique phenomenon in the history of science,” says Federico Capasso, a professor of applied physics at SEAS who was at Bell Labs with Murray. “You were working at the frontier of science and technology—it was a whirlwind of innovation and invention.”  In an environment she describes as simultaneously competitive and collaborative, Murray rose to become the Senior Vice President of Physical Sciences, one of the highest positions held by a woman at Bell Labs.“I have certainly been extremely lucky in my career in that I don’t feel like I have been hampered tremendously,” Murray says. “Obviously there is unconscious gender bias in this society, so of course I’m affected by that.”But while vice president, she says her division’s budget and staff were slashed amid multiple reorganizations of the Labs, taking a significant toll on physical sciences research there.Bishop credits Murray with working tirelessly to rebuild Bell’s physical sciences division.“She is extremely effective both as a scientist but also as a scientific leader,” says Bishop. “The folks at Harvard are lucky to get someone like her.” Murray’s drive was not lost on another director at Bell—SEAS founding Dean Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti.“He was head of materials science and was trying to recruit me, but I went into physics instead,” Murray says.But though Venky, who remains a professor of engineering and applied sciences at SEAS, failed to convince Murray to join his specialty, he did manage to help get Murray to join his school, where she appears poised to continue his interdisciplinary vision for SEAS.PHYSICS FOR ALLMurray says she was attracted to SEAS by its interdisciplinary nature and focus on applied science—while always keeping the question “Why am I doing this?” in mind.“We have some serious problems that Harvard can address, including global health, clean energy technologies, figuring out what is happening to the climate system and the planet, and finding economic security,” Murray says. “In all of those areas, SEAS is absolutely perfect for Harvard to have a major impact.” Echoing Venky’s vision, Murray says she believes that we can only solve these problems through interdisciplinary learning and by educating leaders who can understand science. She says she will continue to develop the Technology, Science and Society concentration and the Bioengineering concentration for undergraduates as well as work to establish connections with Harvard’s other schools. “We have all these horizontal interactions between SEAS and systems biology and the Medical School, and I think she’ll be great in establishing bridges,” says Capasso. Colleagues say her experience as both an experimentalist and as a manager is the right combination for leading SEAS.“She is able to look at both the big picture and at details, and that’s not a common thing,” says Capasso. “She has this impressive management experience. We need someone who has both the vision but also knows how to run things.”—Staff writer Alissa M. D’Gama can be reached at adgama@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From Adams to Winthrop, Mather to the Quad, it has been a fixture of the College’s House system, a concept older than the 12 upperclassmen Houses themselves. But some Harvard administrators say that after a history spanning two centuries and an ocean, the Senior Common Room—an idea originally conceived at British universities—is in need of an extensive reevaluation.According to the Report on Harvard House Renewal, which College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds released to the public last Tuesday, the SCR is an “outdated” and disconnected component of House life.Topping the list of 19 proposed recommendations in the report is resolving why the SCR “is not working well for current students and faculty.”Undergraduates, resident tutors, House Masters, and SCR members themselves echoed similar sentiments, expressing the need to make the SCR more relevant to undergraduates. Currently, many students know little more than the physical space of the room—and often not even that.“Honestly, I don’t even know where it is,” said Pforzheimer House resident Elizabeth J.S. Bates ’11.MORE THAN A ROOMIn numerous interviews with The Crimson, students said they were unaware that the term SCR refers to a group of interdisciplinary faculty, tutors, and other House affiliates.The Office of Residential Life defines the function of the SCR as providing “undergraduates with an opportunity to seek support and advice from members of the Harvard community at various stages of their professional careers.”“In any other social circumstance, you don’t always meet someone who becomes a lifelong friend or mentor,” said Myra A. Mayman, who served as Cabot House Master from 1984 to 1988, referencing the expectation that the SCR might foster lasting faculty-student relationships. Yet a majority of students and SCR-affiliated members of the Harvard community alike said this goal remains largely unfulfilled. They pointed to a lack of student participation at SCR events and a general dearth of understanding of its function.“In theory, it’s a great idea to provide undergraduates with access to professionals with career advice,” Mather House resident tutor Joseph S. Ronayne ’92 said.He added that the reality of Harvard residential life diverges from this expectation.THROUGH THE AGESBut the goal of the original Oxford and Cambridge SCRs was not to create familial rapports. Diverging from its more formal and stilted English counterpart, the Harvard SCR model was designed to foster casual interaction between faculty and students. “In England, the professors just sit and stare down at undergraduates. They’re probably only worried about the quality of their wine cellars,” Mayman said. In establishing the current residential life system in the early twentieth century, University President Abbott L. Lowell, class of 1877, sought to depart from some of the English system’s shortcomings.To that end, he envisaged the SCR as a way to engender a more convivial and inter-generational academic environment in the Houses.At its inception, the House system integrated academic and social life—with professors living, teaching, and working in the Houses.But as the College doubled its undergraduate class size and faculty members began orienting themselves around their disciplines, the role of faculty members in the Houses gradually diminished.And despite Lowell’s initial intentions, the SCR became perceived in much the same light as its English prototype.When Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 began his tenure, he said the SCR seemed detached from students.“We found that the SCR was largely made up of a group of older members of the Harvard senior community who knew each other and liked to come together once a week, drink cocktails, eat lunch, and then leave,” he said.Even though the Houses boasted the presence of prominent faculty members, to students, the SCR remained largely unacknowledged. “When I was an undergraduate, the SCR had a mysterious quality.  We didn’t know what it was about,” said J. Russell Muirhead ’88, who is a University of Texas at Austin professor and Eliot House SCR affiliate.  But Muirhead alluded to the potential for occasional meaningful interaction in the SCR.  As a senior, he recalled attending an SCR function in which he unintentionally sat next to the former Harvard Law School director of admissions.“After that night, I kept up with her for years,” he said. “It was a shame I didn’t want to go to law school.”LOOKING AHEAD Throughout the last decade, Palfrey said that Adams House has attempted to recruit SCR members who would be more interested in directly engaging with undergraduates. Still, both SCR members and students acknowledged that it is difficult for undergraduates to incorporate SCR functions into their busy schedules.  “Harvard is an unbelievably rich place. There’s a bewildering array of opportunities, so who’s going to go the SCR when Brad Pitt and Angelia Jolie come here?” Mayman said. (Pitt and Jolie were slated to be at a College event earlier this week, but did not end up attending.)The House Renewal Report recommends fostering “casual yet meaningful” exchanges between undergraduates by supplementing the SCR with a pilot House Fellows Program in some Houses. The new initiative will establish clear expectations for Fellows, who will have short tenures, in order to facilitate informal exchanges with undergraduates.Based on his experiences as a resident tutor, when he taught classes in Eliot House, Muirhead said that the most effective way to facilitate an intellectual community—as President Lowell envisioned more than seven decades ago—would be to re-integrate academic and residential life.“Build some nice classrooms in the Houses with that $1 billion,” he said, alluding to the total cost of House renewal—a project to renovate the 12 Houses based on the proposals of the House Renewal Report.  No one wants “the SCR to be a room associated with all the old geezers that used to come and drink by themselves,” Palfrey said.  —Staff writer Bita N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William Wade, the assistant coach who quietly guided the ascension of the Harvard Men’s Basketball team through his influence on the recruiting process, will be leaving the Crimson’s sidelines to join the staff at Virginia Commonwealth University, The Crimson confirmed yesterday.   The young coach, who spent the last two years combing the country in search of new talent for the Crimson’s roster, was one of the architects behind last season’s recruiting class and has been instrumental in building what is expected to be an equally impressive haul next year.“It is a bittersweet moment for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said in an e-mailed statement. “While we are disappointed to lose Will, he has a tremendous opportunity at VCU, and we are thrilled for him. We’ll certainly miss him greatly and the terrific job he did for Harvard Basketball.”With the recruiting season culminating in the next few weeks, the move is likely to send ripples through the program. In interviews with the Boston Globe and Scout.com respectively, high school seniors Kyle Casey, who verbally committed to Harvard in February, and Dee Giger, who committed to the Crimson last July, each cited Wade as one of their primary reasons for choosing the College.“He was very persistent and comes off immediately as a personal, great guy,” said freshman guard Oliver McNally, one of the players recruited by Wade last season. “He can make connections with all types of kids.”Wade’s departure comes on the eve of a weekend in which Harvard plays host to two of the nation’s top recruits. Blue-chippers Dwight Powell and Rod Odom are expected to visit campus this weekend, according to the Cornell Basketball Blog.The cases of particular recruits are not allowed to be discussed because of NCAA regulations, making it hard to determine just how Wade’s move could jeopardize the commitments of players with whom he has built personal relationships. For his part, Wade insisted that recruiting remains in capable hands.“Coach Amaker is a tremendous recruiter,” Wade said. “He’s going to carry the torch recruiting-wise—Coach [Kenny] Blakeney does a tremendous job, and whoever else they hire will do a great job. In a lot of ways, Harvard sells itself.”Several players agreed with Wade, saying that his departure will not impact next season’s recruiting class.“We have a good class coming in, and I don’t think his leaving will affect anybody,” junior guard Jeremy Lin said, a sentiment echoed by captain Andrew Pusar.It is unclear who will assume Wade’s responsibilities and whether that person will come from inside or outside the program.“I know [Amaker] has got a wide list of names,” Wade said of potential candidates for his replacement. “I know he’ll find the best guy for the program, and everything will keep clicking.”Wade is leaving Cambridge to join a VCU coaching staff headed by Shaka Smart, who was named head coach of the program last week. The Rams have made two of the past three NCAA tournaments, scoring a first-round upset over Duke in 2007.“We are going to wreak havoc on our opponents’ psyche and their plan of attack,” Smart promised in the press conference announcing his appointment.Wade and Smart coached together for Clemson during the 2006-07 basketball season, where Wade served as the director of men’s basketball operations and Smith was an assistant coach and the recruiting coordinator for the Tigers under head coach Oliver Purnell.“Coach Smart and I are very close friends,” Wade said. “It would have taken a lot for me to leave Harvard, because I loved Harvard and I loved what we were building.”Wade’s first class of recruits helped the Crimson improve from eight wins last year to 14 wins this season, which included victories over Boston College and Cornell. His second class of recruits will not be finalized until late May, but early projections have it ranked at the top of the Ivy League. Outside of recruiting, Wade’s presence was felt in the team locker room.“I think everyone had a good relationship with Coach,” Pusar said. “He was really in touch with the personality of the team. It helped us psychologically. When things were going good, he knew what to say, and when things were going bad, he knew what to say.”“Obviously he’ll be missed,” Lin added. “He was an integral part of our basketball family.”If his 2010 recruiting class holds together, Wade, Smart’s first hire at VCU, will be assured a legacy at Harvard for at least the next four years.“I’m just thankful that I was able to spend two years at such a great institution and meet so many great people,” Wade said. “It was just a tremendous experience for me, and I really appreciate Harvard taking a chance on me and giving me the opportunity.”“I look forward to following Harvard the next couple of years as we win our first Ivy League title and make history,” he added. “It will be a lot of fun to see.”—Staff writer Timothy J.

Where there’s email, there’s spam. With a plethora of list-servs at their fingertips, Harvard students have gotten pretty adept at sending out  provocative, enticing, and downright ludicrous statements in order to pump up attendance for whatever a cappella jam/dance show/charity event/speakers’ panel/massive orgy that is going on at the moment. It's all spam to FlyBy.  But, you know what they say: one man's trash is another man's treasure.  So here are some of the most weird, funny, and heartbreaking spam excerpts that  FlyBy found in its recent inbox memory.  Try to guess what they're about (you will fail).  Answers after the jump.
1)  “BEST CAKE EVER…”
2) “we help you explore your greatest dreams and sickest fantasies!”
3) “Get Yourself Stuffed!!”
4) “But Marty McFly can travel in space and time, so why can’t you?”
5) “Sooo…Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will be on campus Wednesday…”
6) “Go to Hawaii for $7!”
1) [BEST CAKE EVER...] “…is going to be at the opening night of The Exonerated,” a play about six death-row inmates who were exonerated decades afterwards. Cake and falsely convicted criminals? FlyBy does not see the connection. After following a youtube link and watching a nearly-three minute long montage done to Aerosmith, FlyBy still found no signs of cake. Hungry and confused.
2) [“we help you explore your greatest dreams and sickest fantasies!”] From an advertisement for the Exodus: Escape Reality show put on by Expressions Dance Company. If narcophiliacs with foot fetishes and law school ambitions show up, all FlyBy can say is: be careful what you ask for.
3) [“Get Yourself Stuffed!!”]. With dumplings in select common rooms or delivered to your dorm. Is there a more awkward way of promoting an otherwise appealing and delicious food?  This sounded downright dirty.
4) [“But Marty McFly can travel in space and time, so why can’t you?”] Nope, you cannot travel through time in a stylish ride and no, you still definitely cannot make out with your mom while she was still hot. You can, however, attend South East Asia Night where eight dishes are served to help you get over your Freudian desires and dreams to dance like a duck at prom with zero social consequences.
5) [“Sooo…Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will be on campus Wednesday…”]... Right. 
6) [“Go to Hawaii for $7!”] So, the economy is not doing so well. And yes, airlines are facing their fair share of woes but a chance to go to Hawaii for  $7? If it sounds too good to be true, that’s because it is. Although $7 won’t be enough to check in your luggage at the airport, it can score you a ticket to the Hawaiian club’s Lu’au.  Which takes place, incidentally, in a dining hall.  On campus.
Dropping these lines may be appealing, all they really do is induce us to scan over the email, be really confused/cry a little on the inside, press delete, and never remember the aforementioned a cappella jam/dance show/charity event/speakers’ panel/massive orgy anyways. Thanks for nothing, every student group on campus.

All those admitted students who applied to MIT because it was tied with Harvard for the most varsity sports of any university are going to be sorely disappointed.
Citing economic woes (this is getting kind of old...), our Cambridge neighbors announced they would be dropping some varsity sports, according to the MIT Tech, leaving Harvard in the lead for the (prestigious? sure, why not?) most varisty sports crown. Devastating news for the MIT Engineers. But at least the athletes have some warning, right?
So much for that. In case you were wondering, Harvard and MIT have been tied at 41 varsity sports, though Harvard's are all Division I, while MIT's are not. For the insatiably curious among you, we've got Harvard's full list, after the jump.

The Harvard Polo Club--a group of rich kids who like to play with horses and wear tight, white jeans for fun? Not really.
If you hearken back to last year's Undergraduate Council election season, you'll remember that there was one particular duo running for the presidency and vice presidency: Roy T. Willey '09 and Nicholas B. Snow '09. During the campaign, a  little fact emerged about Willey and Snow: their involvement in the Harvard Polo Club. And it confused a lot of people who had never heard about it, like Derek M. Flanzraich '10.
After about a century of program failures and rebirths, the Harvard Polo Club regrouped in 2007 and just capped off its most groundbreaking season yet. Watch the video after the jump to see whether all those stereotypes are true, and if you're into what you see...maybe you can be the next Nick Snow?

International Relations Week, Hinduism Awareness Week , Islam Awareness Week, Africa Week --Harvard has been inundated with events in the past few days. More than usual, as if that were possible.

In the flurry of emails and in the face of endless posters, it's probably been easy for Harvard students to overlook the reliable happenings at the IOP Forum.  But this Monday it played host to a clash between a Harvard law student and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank '61 that was so volatile it made national news. All the evidently newsworthy details, after the jump.
Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, focused on the financial crisis.  After listening to his speech, Joel Pollak, a student at the law school, told Frank that the crisis "happened on your watch" and asked if Frank took "any responsibility" for the slide.  Frank appeared to lose his cool and grew defensive, saying that Pollak "made an accusation that is wholly inaccurate."  Their conversation escalated, with Frank calling Pollak's words a "right-wing attack on liberals", and Pollak retorting that Frank's "entire speech blam[ed] conservatives". 
When FlyBy talked to Pollak today, he said he was surprised about how much attention the incident has received.  He said he hasn't checked his email in the last couple of days due to Passover, but he's aware that this episode has suddenly placed him in the spotlight. 
"I have hundreds of new Facebook friends, let's put it that way," he laughed.
Asking questions at the IOP Forum can lead to national fame?  Who knew?

Class of '13, look no further: this  is how you can fight the  Freshman 15 next fall.   Le Whiff, a mini inhaler that sprays the taste of chocolate without actually imparting anything caloric, is now on the market.  Developed by Professor David Edwards and some of his students from Engineering Sciences 147, Le Whiff is one product of Harvard research that makes FlyBy think, "What? Cool!  Why?"  The answers, after the jump.
In fall of 2007, Larissa H. Zhou ’10 and Trevor J. Martin ’10 took Engineering Sciences 147: “Idea Translation: Effecting Change through the Arts and Sciences,” taught by Edwards.  Edwards, a biomedical engineering professor known for his development of an inhalable tuberculosis vaccine, urged his students to come up with innovative products for their class projects.  The idea of inhalable food was suggested, and from there, the project was born.
The inhalers are currently only on sale in Paris, but can be ordered online.  Edwards has expressed his intention to expand the project to other types of inhalable food.  Will Le Whiff be a success?  Well, think about it... would you pay for a puff?
