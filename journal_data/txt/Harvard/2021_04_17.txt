After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a first episode that puts Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds” to shame, “The Irregulars” is a wild ride from start to finish. Taking place in Victorian London, “The Irregulars” follows a group of young teens enlisted to help John Watson, partner of Sherlock Holmes, solve a series of increasingly violent paranormal crimes. As the mysteries spiral out of control, they must find and close “The Rip,” a tear between the natural world and the supernatural world, in order to save the city.
The greatest strength of “The Irregulars” lies in its characters. The main band of teens is made up of Bea (Thaddea Graham), Spike (McKell David), Billy (Jojo Macari), Leo (Harrison Osterfield), and Jessie (Darcy Shaw). Each member of the group has their own arc, but the ensemble nature of the show means that some (such as Bea and Jessie) got center spotlight for this season — but with a rumored Season Two in the works, along with the set-ups for character development introduced in the Season One finale, the season doesn’t feel incomplete. Overall, it’s an excellent reimagination of the ever-beloved found family trope, and seeing how much the characters care for each other encourages the audience to care for them as well.
With the booming success of the Young Adult genre in the book market, it's no wonder that the genre would make its way over to television. “The Irregulars” has many hallmarks of the YA world, including love triangles, identity exploration, and even the revelation that adults don’t actually know everything. While these cliches are easily recognizable, they’re well executed here, with depth and unique twists added throughout. The cast gives earnest and nuanced performances, which helps prevent these tropes from seeming overdone in the show. The most refreshing aspect of these characters and their portrayals is that the teens are actually allowed to behave like teens. They have all the enthusiasm and recklessness of real teenagers, their emotional highs and lows making them even more endearing. Though it’s clear from the beginning that the show is targeting an audience of young adults, it’s still enjoyable to watch for viewers of all ages and with any relationships to the original Sherlock Holmes series.
“The Irregulars” is not your typical Sherlock adaptation. The famed detective doesn’t even appear except by name until halfway through the season. Even once he does show up on the screen, the portrait of Sherlock Holmes is less than flattering, and the treatment of Watson is similarly complicated. While the representations of the pair are not traditional, they are grounded and real, and these characters are used to explore darker themes such as addiction and grief in conjunction with the younger characters. However, what does remain from the source material is the satisfaction of small details leading the protagonist to solve the mystery at the heart of each episode. While each installment has a separate supernatural occurrence to explore, they manage to collectively contribute to the overarching narrative, and all critique the concept of genius that Sherlock desperately clings to.
For those looking to “The Irregulars” for mystery and intrigue, the show definitely satisfies. While some twists and turns are predictable (the man who is conspicuously nice to one character for no apparent reason turns out to be a villain? How shocking!), there are so many exceptional surprises throughout. It's a show that allows the audience to speculate while keeping viewers entertained, maintaining a delicate balance that is not always easy to strike. Are there some minor plot holes here and there? Yes. Does the dialogue sometimes feel a bit cheesy and over the top? Of course. Regardless, “The Irregulars” is one of the most exciting, fun, and delightfully horrifying Netflix shows of the moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University, one of the foremost academic institutions in the world, where only 3 percent of the faculty is conservative.
If academia is the collaborative pursuit of truth that relies on a diverse set of views, then ideological homogeneity of any kind is poison for a healthy academic community — not to mention detrimental to free speech.
It’s not shocking that I, a right-of-center student on campus, would be worried about freedom of speech given that I am in the ideological minority. Yet, embedded in my conservative leanings is the belief that private institutions, like Harvard, can technically do whatever they want. While I think this dire ideological imbalance among the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is detrimental to the quality of education, I will not protest if Harvard, as a private entity, wants it to stay this way. However, the real issue is that Harvard is at odds with the very free speech principles that it has defined for itself, and is doing little to address these infractions.
Harvard, surprisingly, has formal guidelines for free speech. I didn’t even know these existed — upon asking my friends whether they’d heard about the guidelines, each one answered in the negative. They are the type of “rules” I would have expected to hear at freshman orientation or at the beginning of every academic year, but didn’t.
The administration has, to its credit, evoked the spirit of these guidelines in some of their statements. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, for instance, made a statement in 2019 saying that some Harvard students “see those with differing opinions as undeserving of our attention, our respect, or our compassion.” The administration has also allowed the attendance of certain controversial speakers. Yet the actualization of these guidelines at the faculty and student level is yet to be seen.
FAS asserts that the “free interchange of ideas” is “vital” to the University’s mission of “discovering and disseminating ideas through research, teaching, and learning.” This “vital” purpose is drastically restricted by the utter lack of ideological variety among its faculty.
Only seven out of 236 members of the FAS identified themselves as conservative in The Crimson’s 2021 Faculty Survey. Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw claimed that if he were “a right-of-center untenured professor” he would not “advertise [his] views.” Professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53, a notoriously conservative professor in the Government department, shared that some of his Democratic colleagues believe that “it doesn’t matter what party [they] belong to” because they are “scientists” who are “objective.” Objectivity is a dangerous claim to make when all of your colleagues think the same way.
If non-conservative faculty have attained academic truth, the value of a liberal arts education and the goal of “discovering and disseminating ideas” become defunct. Our hallowed veritas becomes a meaningless slogan. Is it any surprise that 41 percent of Harvard’s surveyed faculty feel that the University’s standing within higher education has fallen over the last decade?
We value academic papers with peer review, scientific studies that are replicable, yet we discredit academic conversations that are examined from different angles.
Harvard’s guidelines even state that FAS does “not permit censorship of noxious ideas.” This came as a shock to me after spending the past year listening to my peers calling for the exclusion of voices they see as offensive and the administration’s tacit consent in their silence.
While I often agree that some of these “noxious ideas” are flawed, I am still convinced that their presence is of value, if just to criticize or protest. This is not, of course, an endorsement for hate speech or openly false narratives on campus. But it’s an understanding that the views some students deem offensive still have academic value. The FAS agrees: “We assume that the long term benefits to our community will outweigh the short term unpleasant effect.”
As students were calling for the banning of Trump administration officials on campus, I shared their outrage over the problematic and undemocratic nature of election misinformation. Yet, I still feel that certain administration members would bring valuable conversations to the University.
Is the purported “commitment” to open discourse truly being carried out if professors feel their academic freedom is so at risk that they have to organize with preemptive legal aid? The 18 Harvard affiliates in the new Academic Freedom Alliance would probably argue that the answer is no. Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker, one of these members, feels freedom of opinion at universities is “indisputably under threat.”
To me, it sounds like these professors are trying to protect themselves from backlash in the case that they explore a potentially “noxious” subject. Harvard hasn’t done enough to make them feel safe, so they’ve had to look outward for support.
If you don’t find this problematic, the University does, at least according to the guidelines: “Interference with members of the University in performance of their normal duties and activities” is an “unacceptable obstruction of the essential processes of the University.” This has undeniable consequences for the integrity of academia, and subsequently, the student body.
I experienced these consequences first hand in discussions about the Crimson article that revealed the faculty’s ideological homogeneity. Many of my peers did not even think this was an issue worth their time.
Upon defending the merits of ideological diversity, I am often told by peers that conservatism doesn’t even deserve a place in academia. The usual explanation is that conservatism is racism, sexism, etc. and thus, irredeemable. My ideas are deemed worthless, undeserving of a spot at the academic table.
But the grave irony of conversations like these is that my peers, especially the most antagonizing, always ask “what is conservatism?” So we are going to write off an entire ideology that we don’t understand and then assert that educational homogeneity isn’t an issue?
The FAS free speech guidelines conclude with the assertion that “intense personal harassment” amounts to “grave disrespect for the dignity of others” is an “unacceptable violation” of the “personal rights on which the University is based.”
If Harvard is to proclaim commitment to these self-authored “personal rights,” I suggest they make stronger attempts to actually uphold them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has a yellow brick road. If you want to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, Harvard can help you do that. You need only follow the path (of course with a lot of personal effort).
Upsolve, the nonprofit I work at, like a number of other organizations founded at Harvard, got its start when our cofounder Rohan Pavuluri ’18 found this path. As a sophomore researching at Harvard Law School’s Access to Justice Lab with Professor James Greiner, Rohan learned two things that would change his life: first, that millions of low-income Americans can’t access their basic legal rights because they can’t afford a lawyer, and second, that bankruptcy is a powerful tool that can give a financial fresh start to low-income people trapped in debt from medical bills, job loss, and predatory loans, but few can afford $1,500 for an attorney to tell a court they are broke.
Passionate about helping low-income people overcome crushing debt and access their rights, Rohan set out to create an online web app to assist people with the bankruptcy process.
Along Rohan’s journey, he encountered a remarkable array of the University’s people and resources that joined him to make Upsolve possible. Courses such as Engineering Sciences 95r: “Startup R & D” taught at Harvard’s School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences (which he took three times), Democracy, Politics and Institutions 663: “Tech and Innovation in Government” taught at Harvard Kennedy School, Government 2430: “Data Science to Save the World”, and Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” were all crucial in creating Upsolve. This doesn’t include the multiple independent studies Rohan did, each with faculty advisors, on various aspects of how to start Upsolve. Additionally, faculty and fellows at Harvard Business School and HKS gave their time to discuss Upsolve’s development, and HLS Professor James Greiner and HKS lecturer Nick Sinai even joined as advisors.
The Harvard iLab provided space and Harvard awarded Upsolve grants in rapid succession totaling over $200,000 of seed funding, all while Rohan was an undergraduate. Upsolve received a Harvard Institute of Politics Gov 2.0 grant ($5,000); a Harvard Center for Public Interest Careers Liman Fellowship ($4,000); a Harvard i3 Innovation Challenge grant ($10,000); a Harvard President's Innovation Challenge grand prize ($75,000); an Access to Justice Tech Fellowship that paid an HLS graduate to work at Upsolve for a year ($80,000); and a Pforzheimer Public Service Fellowship ($30,000). Even more, every year since Rohan graduated, Upsolve has received a Harvard Mindich Service Fellow each summer, which was how I first joined Upsolve and became passionate about using tech to increase access to justice.
Today, Harvard’s initial investment in Upsolve has seen a massive return with $350 million of debt relieved for low-income Americans and recognition of Harvard’s critical role in Upsolve’s founding covered in numerous major news outlets.
Upsolve is certainly not the only organization to incubate at and receive funding from Harvard. In fact, Upsolve isn’t even the only Harvard-funded nonprofit that uses tech to help low-income people access their rights for free — there is Immigrationhelp.org, for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications, and Justfix, for fighting landlord harassment and neglected housing conditions.
Outside of the tech-enhanced access to justice space, Harvard has supported a number of exciting organizations, including personal favorites of mine: Coding it Forward, which places students with tech backgrounds in impact roles in government; Umbilizer, which produces portable ventilators for 10 percent of the traditional cost that could expand access around the world; and Breaktime, which is working to break the cycle of young adult homelessness in Boston through purposeful transitional employment.
If you’re interested in starting a social impact organization at Harvard, I recommend looking into the programs discussed above to find community, mentorship, and funding as well as other programs such as the Cheng Fellowship, which Breaktime cofounder Connor Schoen ’20 wrote was a “life-changing experience for me personally and a game-changing experience for Breaktime as an organization” in an email.
Other programs to consider include the iLab Venture Incubation Program, the Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellowship, the Harvard Graduate School of Education Innovation & Ventures in Education Pitch Competition, the Harvard Club of Boston Summer Fellowship, and the Phillips Brooks House Association Priscilla Chan Stride Service Program, all of which helped Breaktime launch. If you’re a graduate student you can also apply to the Social Enterprise Track of the HBS New Venture Competition. Organizations like Breaktime have also found support from clubs such as Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment (which donated more than $10,000), Harvard College Consulting Group, HBS’s Consulting for Impact, and Harvard Tech for Social Good, among other clubs.
With the extraordinary amount of support you can find at Harvard and a number of leading nonprofits having started here, clearly Harvard is, as Rohan has said, “one of the best incubators in the world, especially if you are trying to tackle the world’s most pressing problems.”
Yet too often this path is the one less traveled.
And of course, Harvard can do even more to support passion-struck students in launching impact organizations. Harvard can start by adding more road signs and by widening the road.
For example, much like there are comprehensive information sessions covering every summer research opportunity, there could be information sessions covering every social impact program, competition, and resource that Harvard provides.
Without a coordinated center for social impact programs at Harvard, students can be disoriented, wondering whether their project belongs at the iLab, CPIC, Cheng, IOP, or PBHA. More concerningly, the resources are so spread out; as Connor notes in his email to me, “you could be a social innovator and go through Harvard without knowing about the Cheng fellowship even though it's such a great program.”
Beyond helping students navigate resources and programs, Harvard can simply create more winners. Why should Harvard’s President’s Innovation Challenge only select five grand prize recipients and five runner-ups each year to receive significant seed funding when all 25 of this year’s finalists are so inspiring?
That said, if you’re willing to do the legwork to follow Harvard's yellow brick road to launching a social impact organization, you may find at the end of the journey that, in many ways, there’s no place like Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first half of the finale of Under Review, hosts Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham put two reviews of the Harvard University Police Department, one by University-hired consultants and the other by abolitionist activists, head to head. Listen and subscribe on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.
“Under Review” is produced by Zing Gee, Thomas Maisonneuve, Lara F. Dada, and Justin Y. Ye. Music by Ian Chan. Art by Meera S. Nair.
