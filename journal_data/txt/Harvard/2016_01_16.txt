After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s School of Public Health recently opened a global health research center in Mumbai in a move that strengthens the University’s existing presence in the region.
Proposed last year, the center will support the work of Harvard affiliates studying public health in India, according to Jorge I. Domínguez,  former Vice Provost for International Affairs who stepped down last year. He said several of Harvard’s other international centers—which number more than 15—were precedents for the Mumbai center, particularly those in Botswana and Tanzania. Harvard already has two other research hubs in the city, offices of the South Asia Institute and Harvard Business School’s research center, both of which are within walking distance to the global health center.
“HSPH has been doing partnership projects in India for over 40 years,”  Swati A. Piramal, a graduate of of the School of Public Health and donor to the Mumbai office space, wrote in an email. “Now it has its own space, which could be a training hub for the whole of South East Asia.” 
Despite Harvard’s past research involvement in India, the new center faced logistical challenges of space and funding before its opening ceremony last month. Although Piramal’s donation solved problems of limited office space, the school looked “wherever possible” for other donations, Domínguez said. The center received funding from a combination of alumni, U.S. federal grants, and contractual grants and donations from the Indian government, he added.
While administrators have wanted to open another research center in India for some time, the School of Public Health faced regulatory challenges that slowed the project’s pace, Domínguez said.
“India is a terrific place for Harvard to work with, but the process of legal authorization tends to move slowly,” Domínguez said. “So the idea of opening this office has been around for several years, but the actual legal, regulatory work to make sure it could open has taken a while.”
Harvard needed to comply with both India’s federal laws and the laws of the region where Mumbai sits, according to Domínguez.
“It wasn’t that difficult to motivate faculty and students to work in India,” Domínguez said. “The infrastructure, the location, the funding, the legal regulatory context, is what had been taking a fair amount of time.”
The other Harvard research centers in Mumbai opened within the past two decades. Harvard Business School opened its own India Research Center in Mumbai in 2006. The South Asia Institute, a University-wide research center devoted to studying the region founded in 2003, has traditionally been the hub of South Asian-related research and programming. With the HBS and School of Public Health centers now open, the number of Harvard personnel in Mumbai has grown from around three to “well in the two digit range,”  according to Domínguez.
The School of Public Health’s research center will likely alter how researchers interact with the other Harvard institutes in the region. Whereas previously, students interested in studying in India typically coordinated with the South Asia Institute, the new center will become the focal point for faculty and students studying public health specifically.
Domínguez said he expects that undergraduates pursuing a secondary in global health will also be able to research at the Mumbai center.
Piramal said she hopes the new center, and its output of research, will positively impact the region.
“India is a rapidly growing country but our healthcare is much behind in many important health indicators and the millennium development goals still need a huge amount of work,” she wrote. “ HSPH has a vast global experience that can bring both technology and skills to find innovative solutions for India’s healthcare needs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ray Leone has resigned from his position as the Branca Family Head Coach for Harvard Women’s Soccer to accept a job as head coach of the University of Maryland women’s soccer team, the Harvard Athletic Department announced Wednesday. Leone had served as the headman for the Crimson since 2007.
“I was very fortunate to have worked at Harvard and coach so many great people,” Leone wrote in a statement to The Crimson. “The players I have coached mean so much to me and I will always be connected to Harvard Women’s Soccer. I will be their biggest fan from this point forward.”
During his time at Harvard, Leone compiled a 90-49-18 record, including a 44-14-5 mark in Ivy League play. The Severna Park, Md., native led the team to five Ivy League Championships and consequently five NCAA Tournaments bids, along with an opening-round victory in 2014. He was named Ivy League Coach of the Year in 2014, and during his tenure he coached three Ivy League Players of the Year, two Academic All-Americans, and 38 All-Ivy selections—including 22 First Team picks.
Before being named the fifth head coach in program history at Harvard, Leone was the headman at Arizona State, where he led the Sun Devils to a 60-45-14 mark in his six seasons. In 2007, he took over a Crimson team that finished 3-13-1 the year before, and his impact was felt immediately. Leone led the team to a 10-6-1 mark in his first season before bringing an Ivy League Championship to Cambridge a year later in 2008, the team’s first since 2004.
During his playing days, Leone was a star at Severna Park High School and a three-time all-conference selection at UNC Charlotte. Afterwards, Leone became the head coach at Berry College and Creighton, starting the women’s soccer program at both schools, as well as Clemson, compiling a 132-58-13 record in 10 seasons prior to moving to Arizona State.
Leone’s wife, Tracey, also resigned from her position on Wednesday, stepping down as the head coach of the Northeastern women’s soccer team. A former midfielder for the U.S. women’s national team, Tracey Leone worked as an assistant coach under her husband at Creighton, Arizona State, and for the Crimson from 2007-2009.
Back home in Maryland, Leone will succeed Jonathan Morgan, who went 35-36-9 in four seasons with the Terrapins. Last season, Maryland won just one conference game, compiling a 6-12-1 overall mark in its second season as a member of the Big Ten. The Terrapins have not qualified for the NCAA Tournament since 2012, when they were still members of the ACC.
According to the Athletic Department, Harvard will immediately begin a nationwide search to find Leone’s successor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nolan Vesey is no longer the only Vesey sibling with a collegiate hat trick to his name.
For the No. 7/8 Harvard men’s hockey team, the end of Nolan’s bragging rights could not have come at a better time.
After the Crimson failed to find twine in the first 40 minutes of play Friday night against No. 18/- St. Lawrence, three goals from co-captain Jimmy Vesey in the span of less than five minutes provided the offensive surge needed for Harvard to take down the Saints (10-9-2, 4-4-1 ECAC), 3-2.
“We had to grind it out in a way that wasn’t pretty,” Vesey said. “But that’s a huge two points in the ECAC.”
Vesey’s first strike came just over three minutes into the final frame. With 31 seconds left on a 4-on-4, the Predators prospect skated from the right corner behind the net and out to the blue line, bringing a St. Lawrence defenseman with him. Then he turned on a dime, leaving his man behind as he charged towards net. A deke spun another defenseman around, opening a shooting lane that Vesey took full advantage of, flicking a backhander top-shelf to beat sophomore goaltender Kyle Hayton and pull Harvard (9-3-3, 5-2-3) even.
Less than two-and-a-half minutes later, the former Hobey Baker finalist struck again, moving from the right boards at the blue line to between the faceoff circles. The senior let go a wrister just before absorbing a huge hit, but the puck found the net nonetheless, giving Harvard a 2-1 advantage with 13:45 left to play.
And, just in case the one-goal lead would not suffice, Vesey took matters into his own hands one more time less than three minutes later for his final tally of the night. Skating between two defensemen and around another, the Charlestown native threatened a backhand shot but instead beat Layton’s right pad on the forehand to notch his first career hat trick on an unassisted effort.
“I’m happy he’s on my team,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Jimmy certainly made a lot of big-time plays.“
Vesey’s third goal was more than just a ceremonial achievement. St. Lawrence would strike with 1:31 remaining to cut the lead to one, as senior forward Sean McGovern poked in a rebound that eluded the glove of sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen, who was trying to freeze the puck. But the Crimson managed to prevent the Saints from finding an equalizer in the last 91 seconds, giving Harvard its first win over St. Lawrence since Feb. 24, 2012.
“For the last 10 minutes, I thought we did a lot of good things—getting pucks deep, holding onto pucks, not giving them any odd-number rushes,” Donato said.
At the end of the second period, it looked as if the Saints might have been able to pull out a win thanks to a bit of luck halfway through the contest. On not the prettiest of plays, Saints sophomore Joe Sullivan drove left towards the goal line with associate captain Alexander Dahl waiting in front. The Vegas native threw the puck weakly on net to generate some sort of action in front for Dahl to capitalize on, but instead saw the puck beat a confused Madsen five-hole to give his squad an early lead.
“I thought Merrick looked solid for the most part,” Donato said. “The first goal is one I’m sure he’d like to have back.”
The goal came after both teams were unable to find a rhythm offensively in the early portion of the game. Despite three Crimson power plays paired with one for St. Lawrence in the first frame, the teams only combined for 14 shots on goal. Harvard's top line of Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and Alexander Kerfoot had just two.
“Our line’s kind of the one that likes to get stuff of the rush, and [St. Lawrence] doesn’t give you a lot of space to do that,” Vesey said.
Junior forward Tyler Moy looked to have Harvard on the board for a moment in the first frame. Senior defenseman Desmond Bergin rocketed a shot from the point which bounced off of Hayton’s chest and popped into the air, enabling Moy to put it home. But the refs immediately deemed that Moy struck the puck above the crossbar—a high-sticking call that would stand after further review.
In what was for most of the game a low-scoring contest, neither team was able to break through on special teams—a familiar fate for the Saints, but not the Crimson. St. Lawrence entered the game last in the conference in power play conversion rate with a rate of 11 percent, which it did not help with an 0-for-3 performance. Harvard, despite having scored on 15 of 52 chances coming into the game, failed to deliver on any of its four chances.

The Harvard men’s basketball team (8-8) will try to make its way above .500 for the first time since the season’s first game Saturday against Howard (8-9). Beat writer David Freed highlights three things to watch as the Crimson go for its second road win of the season.
STARTING UP FRONT
During Harvard’s last three games, the Crimson has not received the production from junior center Zena Edosomwan that they are accustomed to. After turning in an All-Tournament performance in Hawaii that included a 25-point, 16-rebound effort against No. 2 Oklahoma, Edosomwan has just one double-double in four games since returning. He played just 22 minutes against Dartmouth due to foul trouble and was stifled for the first half against Ryerson before breaking through in the second. Howard has a thin front line after center Marcel Boyd, so look for Harvard to feed Edosomwan early and often to get him going.
BEST MAN UP
To stop Howard, you have to stop James Daniel. The junior from Hampton, Virginia averages over a third of the team’s points and nearly half its assists, scoring almost 29 points a contest. Daniel has a tendency to hijack the team’s offense at times, taking 36 shots in a double overtime loss to Radford earlier this year. When opponents stop Daniel, they typically stop the Bison, as Howard has won just two games all season when Daniel shot under 40 percent from the field.
This puts the defense of senior Agunwa Okolie on center stage. Always tasked with guarding the best opposing perimeter player, Okolie has gone up against a distinguished slate so far this season. He has guarded four potential All-Americans in Kansas’ Wayne Selden, Providence’s Kris Dunn, Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield, and BYU’s Kyle Collingsworth. None of the four average as much as Daniel, however, and Okolie’s defense will be the key to stopping the Bison attack.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to individual accomplishments, Jimmy Vesey has achieved just about everything there is for a college hockey player to achieve. Nonetheless, until Friday, one significant feat remained unchecked on the Harvard co-captain’s bucket list.
JIMMY THREESEY
Less than two-and-a-half minutes after tying things up against No. 18/- St. Lawrence (10-9-2, 4-4-1 ECAC) with a goal for the highlight reels Friday night, Vesey took charge a second time, connecting on a wrister from the top of the slot to give his side its first lead of the night.
In addition to handing the No. 7/8 Crimson (9-3-3, 5-2-3) a 2-1 edge with 13:45 remaining, the goal gave Vesey the 12th multi-goal game of his career. As for the first 11 of those contests, however, the final whistle blew with the star forward stuck on two goals.
But on Friday, the 2015 Hobey Baker finalist was not to be denied. Just minutes after scoring his second, Vesey caught a flying puck at the point, dangled his way through the slot, and beat goaltender Kyle Hayton, giving the co-captain his first career three-goal game—a natural hat trick obtained in the most unnatural of ways, with three pucks finding the mesh in less than five minutes.
“We feel like we lost to Jimmy Vesey—we didn’t lose to Harvard tonight,” St. Lawrence coach Greg Carvel said. “He’s too good of a player for this level.”
Vesey now has a team-leading 13 goals to go along with 13 assists through 15 games, giving him the second-best points per game clip in the nation (1.73). That tops the rate of 1.57 which the Predators prospect produced last year when he led the nation in scoring with 32 goals in 37 games.
“That kid’s gonna beat you,” Carvel said, “and unfortunately he just beat us too many times.”
JAW OF LIFE
After sitting out the last four games, senior defenseman Brayden Jaw returned to the lineup on Friday, getting significant minutes in his usual spot on the second pairing alongside 6’7” sophomore Wiley Sherman. Filling in while the senior was sidelined with an undisclosed injury, sophomore Thomas Aiken held his own during the Mariucci Classic, but against No. 10/10 Boston University and No. 2/1 Quinnipiac, he—along with the entire defensive unit—struggled mightily.
The Crimson surrendered 11 goals in those two games, at one point allowing as many as seven scores over a span of 17 minutes spanning the two contests. But with Jaw back in the mix on Friday, Harvard looked impressive in front of sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen, holding the Saints to no more than eight shots on goal in any period and just 20 for the game.
In the first period, St. Lawrence lacked any real quality scoring opportunities, save for the ones that came on a power play courtesy of a Kyle Criscuolo slashing penalty at 6:32. But Jaw cut out the best chance of the Saints’ man advantage with his skate, kicking his foot out to block a shot from top-line forward Drew Smolcynski and keep Madsen out of danger.
“I thought Jawsy was outstanding,” Harvard coach Ted Donato '91 said. “I thought he was quick to pucks, quick to defend, [and] got us out of the zone a bunch. He’s a tremendous skater, and I think having him back was very helpful.”
St. Lawrence does not boast the same kind of offensive firepower that the Terriers and Bobcats do, but entering Friday, the Saints sat just two points behind Harvard in the ECAC and had not lost to the Crimson since Feb. 24, 2012. Yet in the first contest of a two-game weekend slate for Harvard, Jaw’s presence helped the Crimson blue line look stronger than it has in about a month, enabling the hosts to erase its demons against a team Donato said has given his side fits for the past few years.
WIN DIFFERENT WAYS
With the amount of hard, physical hits on display Friday night, you would think it was Rivalry Night at the Bright. St. Lawrence dictated the way the game was going to be played by imposing its physicality early, causing Harvard—a team built primarily on pure speed—to adapt its game.
The different style of play provided a platform for the Crimson defense to regain its form, but the Harvard attack, meanwhile, struggled to find space to generate offense, particularly in the first two periods. Despite averaging 33 shots and just under four goals per game, the Crimson offense was held off the board with only 15 shots to its credit after two frames.
“We had to stay with it, we had to battle,” Donato said. “It wasn’t really going our way, it wasn’t necessarily the type of game we would prefer to play, but you know what? We have to be able to win different ways.”
Harvard began winning more puck battles with its speed in the third, and as a result, the Crimson outshot the Saints by a 16-6 margin in the frame. St. Lawrence would score the final goal of the period—a Sean McGovern second-chance opportunity from the doorstep—but it would not be enough to negate the incredible third-period display from Vesey, whose three goals propelled Harvard into a tie for third with No. 8/7 Cornell in the ECAC standings.
