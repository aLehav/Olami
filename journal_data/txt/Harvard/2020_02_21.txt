After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” starts with an homage to 1987’s “Adventures in Babysitting” — 16-year-old Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) imitates its memorable opening sequence, trying on dresses for her first date and dancing across her room singing “Then He Kissed Me.” Lovestruck and lighthearted, the sequence perfectly epitomizes the story of naive but swoon-worthy young love.
“P.S. I Still Love You” is the long-anticipated follow up to the Netflix movie “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” adapted from Jenny Han’s young adult romance novel of the same name. The first movie followed shy and sweet Lara Jean after her secret love letters were mailed to five former crushes. One such crush was popular jock Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), who suggested that he and Lara Jean “fake date” so he could make his ex-girlfriend jealous. Predictably, fake feelings blossomed into something more, and “P.S. I Still Love You” picks up right where the original left off as Lara Jean and Peter begin to navigate the dynamics of a real relationship. This transition is further complicated by the entrance of John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher), another recipient of the aforementioned love letters, who swoops in with effortless charisma and tugs at Lara Jean’s heart strings. Retaining the charming warmth and relatability of its predecessor, “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” earnestly explores the emotional pitfalls of 21st century teenage romance while delightfully capturing the rose-colored ebullience of first love.
Part of what makes this movie a worthy sequel is that it adds deeper, more complicated layers to Lara Jean’s story. She struggles with insecurities in her first relationship, and Lana Condor is always identifiable as she conveys the self doubt of a teenage girl seeking validation. Lara Jean finds herself comparing her relationship with Peter to his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, a point of insecurity that threatens their fledgling romance; “For every first I was having with him, he’d already had his with her,” she realizes, disappointedly.
While Peter’s ex puts his relationship with Lara Jean to the test, it’s the arrival of John Ambrose — Lara Jean’s middle school crush who moved away — that really applies the pressure. John arrives at Belleview Retirement Villas, where he and Lara Jean are both volunteering, just as winsome as she remembers. While audiences may not be inclined to sympathize with a character that rivals Peter, Jordan Fisher’s portrayal of newcomer John brings great wit and sensitivity to the role, making it easy to love his character. Considerate John is the perfect addition to the storyline, contrasting with Peter’s self-assuredness and leaving Lara Jean with a tough decision to make that keeps audiences invested until the end.
Although most teenage girls can’t identify with being in a love triangle between two nearly perfect boys, Lana Condor brings a grounded, girl-next-door relatability to Lara Jean. Romance is at the forefront of this film, but it also roots itself in deeper, universal issues of loss and flawed family dynamics. “I miss you, Mom. I wish you could tell me what to do,” Lara Jean laments to a photo of her mother, who passed away when she was little. Moreover, this movie is relatable for its modern subtleties, from the school a capella group serenading couples with “Ocean Eyes” by Billie Eilish on Valentine’s Day to Peter and Lara Jean posting every date on their Instagram stories.
Relatability aside, this sequel doesn’t retell the conventional love triangle story in any groundbreaking way. With the contrived but lovable plot of “fake dating” from the first movie gone, the sequel may seem less enticing to some. Despite a formulaic plot, there are enough new elements in “P.S. I Still Love You” to keep audiences on their toes. The cast preserves the onscreen chemistry that made the first movie so successful, and newcomers Jordan Fisher and Holland Taylor (who plays the wonderfully vibrant Stormy, a retired resident at Belleview) elevate a predictable storyline.
Although it's stuffed full of clichés, “P.S. I Still Love You” distinguishes itself from other teen movies with its distinct warm glow — a certain allure that comes from its dreamy color grading, ethereal synth-pop soundtrack, and the likability of its diverse cast. Most importantly, the film holds at its core the irresistible radiance of young romance, telling a palpable love story that can thaw even the coldest of hearts.

For ten years, six toys that call themselves “misfits” gathered for weekly board game nights in Oberon’s dad’s garage, in a suburban-rural town, in a blue state for which voting for a third candidate in a general election probably did not matter. In the tension of the week after the 2016 presidential election, Dez’s microaggressions push the group over the edge, and now the other members must vote whether or not to expel him from the crew. When Dez threatens suicide, the gang must tread carefully and keep Dez in the garage. M.J. Halberstat’s new play, “Deal Me Out,” is an allegorical retelling of the 2016 election more representative of the oppressive mundanity of time than the problems associated with “following the rules.” It suffers from its insipid comedy and uneven characters as often as it is redeemed by the inevitable instability of the long-standing friend group.
The set is perfectly mimetic of the ostensible “white disenfranchisement” of twenty-somethings for whom Bob’s Discount Furniture is too classy. A workbench is piled with boxes of the type of games you’d find on sale at Walmart the day after Christmas — mostly belonging to Dez — and a few choice ones: Ticket to Ride, Pandemic Legacy (20 percent off for a very important reason). Paraphernalia litters the room: A Rainbow Mario Kart Blooper hat rides on an inexplicably lit-up plastic Santa; two mountain bikes are stashed ambitiously on the ceiling, never used. Notably, a film poster for Tim Curry’s “Clue” folds over where the sticky-tack has faltered and it is too high to reach anymore. The room is eternally in the process of being refinished. If sets were principled on Chekhov’s Gun, this would be a cannon. A cannon that is never fired.
The drama is suffused with the rickrolling mantra, “you know the rules, and so do I” — rules that the friends keep in a tabbed 10-cent Staples notebook bound in a Batman trapper-keeper circa 2006.
We all want to hate Matthew Brettschneider’s Dez, slick but cavelier — the type who rehearses his schtick in front of a bathroom mirror and makes suicide jokes just often enough for them not to be irreverent. Brettschneider’s performance bubbles with post-teenage insecurity, but not quite the pre-incel disenchantment that his friends have arraigned him for.
Standout performances include Dev Blair’s subtle, suffering Lucien, whom Dez makes a pass at after encouraging him to escape an abusive relationship and join a therapy group — a fact thrown out in the climax and promptly ignored. Also noteworthy is Micaleen Rodger’s spot-on, constantly misgendered Kay. Such microaggressions are what lead to Dez’s expulsion. M.J. Halberstat should have leaned into these microaggressions more in light of the 2016 election (one week before the play begins) rather than using them as low-hanging, plot-lubricating fodder.
The actors partition the stage, both in dialogue and blocking, making them feel more like strangers than friends. Fiancées Agatha and Cleo touch, then orbit around each other after Dez calls out the discussion of their wedding. They are isolated in their individuality, wrapped mummies in some mid-decade association of queer identity with stigmatization. The feminist lesbian, the nonbinary person, two bisexuals — all are more stand-ins for misfittitude than automatic social outcasts. Lucien — for whom there is little other character development — is gay, abused, and tokenized. The cast collectively crosses their arms and dances more contemporary than rondo about the fold-out chairs and Home Depot miscellanea. At times they seem more archetype than character, devastatingly reminiscent of high school tropes. Yet the tension between Dez and the others after he threatens (or hyperbolizes?) suicide is palpable. Once Cleo hides Dez’s keys in her bra we cannot tell whether the crew has taken Dez as prisoner or they have become more prisoner to him.
At his most vulnerable moment, Dez stands antipodal to Cleo in an otherwise empty room, their worldviews showing commonality only in their opposition. His monologue stabs. It extrapolates to the mundane aftermath where they are canvassing for the same candidate in 2020, maybe at the same rally. The small talk happens. The board game group has broken up. Oberon still drinks in his parents’ basement. Dez is alive and with other people. In the last five minutes, M.J. Halberstat shows us the real horror of “Deal Me Out,” not in being good allegory, but through the the slow dangerous burn of mundanity through time, its ability to create fault lines between people.
The friends gather awkwardly, pyrrhic victors whiplashed out of action too soon, and Lucien asks Cleo not when Dez left, but how Dez left. Then there is black. The audience applauds, tepidly.

Ted Chiang’s short stories win so many awards that science fiction critics joke that the Hugo and Nebula short story awards exist just for him to win. It comes as no surprise, then, that “Exhalation,” Chiang’s newest collection of short stories, is brilliant and thought-provoking. Chiang’s nine short works explore the fundamental and most salient questions about the human condition and what it means to exist. These stories closely interrogate the fundamental forms of knowledge and cognition taken for granted in modern life. Even the most banal presumptions that undergird our quotidian lives are unseated by the strangeness of these stories.
Most striking in “Exhalation” are the stories that share a fascination with breath as the ultimate source of existence. In “Exhalation,” an elaborate contraption of gold foil leaves, the position of which is manipulated by the currents of air that flow through the leaves, replaces the human brain. Through the constant fluttering of the gold leaves, messages are transmitted through the brain via information carried in the currents of airflow. It is thus a differential air pressure which gives us our memory, cognition, and experience. Changes in air pressure create movement in air, and this movement is responsible for the inscription of experience and thought in our consciousness. Central to the story’s novum is the idea that “the universe began as an enormous breath being held.”
Chiang elaborates on this deep relationship between breath and human ontogenesis with cosmological consequence throughout the collection. In another especially incandescent story in the collection, “The Great Silence,” a Puerto Rican parrot narrates the development of a human radio telescope designed to transmit and receive extraterrestrial signals. Chiang’s parrot observes, “It’s no coincidence that ‘aspiration’ means both hope and the act of breathing. When we speak, we use the breath in our lungs to give our thoughts a physical form. The sounds we make are simultaneously our intentions and our life force.” This, both parrots and humans understand well.
Chiang’s interfusion of ontological and cosmological study condenses at the site of breath. The stories beautifully tie breath, which is linked to speech as well as being, biological prerequisite to human life, to one of the fundamental physical principles of the universe — wave resonance. “According to Hindu mythology, the universe was created with a sound: ‘om.’ It is a syllable that contains within it everything that ever was and everything that will be,” Chiang writes. At the same time, Chiang’s “The Great Silence” thinks of cosmic microwave background radiation from the Big Bang as “a barely audible reverberation of that original “om.”
Despite the complexity and galactic scale of the philosophical thought that serves as foundation for Chiang’s stories, they are remarkably accessible. Each story is a quick, dazzling read. They are emotionally impactful as well as intellectually unsettling. This is what is unnerving about Chiang’s stories — they are both heavy and impossibly light at the same time. Chiang’s ideas are not only critically provocative but also incredibly beautiful. There is something stunning in the matter-of-fact way in which he writes: Only the best writers can afford to say beautiful things with such absolute casualness, such definitive flippancy. The story for which the collection is named, “Exhalation,” is a brilliantly imagined piece — its speculative and quasi-surreal mechanism is described in fine, gorgeous detail.
Meticulously imagined, Chiang’s rendering of a world where life and consciousness boil down to a difference in air pressure is, uncannily, both alienated from science and incredibly proximate to the world as we know it. It is through the strategic alienation induced by Chiang’s surrealist, science-fictional world that readers are pushed to more clearly perceive the most important questions regarding humanity’s social, emotional, and cognitive existence.
“The Great Silence,” despite the melancholy that should accompany the observations narrated in the story, is instead quite humorous and cute. The narrative, where a Puerto Rican parrot makes strikingly beautiful (and tragic) observations about humans and the universe, is metonymic of Chiang’s writing style writ large — playfully and gently, Chiang’s stories threaten to upend everything you think you know about yourself and the world.
In a cute, kitschy move, Chiang ends “The Great Silence” with a disarmingly simple message.
“We Puerto Rican parrots … probably won’t be here for much longer; it’s likely that we’ll die before our time and join the Great Silence. But before we go, we are sending a message to humanity,” Chiang writes.
"The message is this:
You be good. I love you.”

Seaport, one of Boston’s trademark shopping and events districts, took on a new name and facade this winter with the addition of a new winter village: Snowport. Debuting in December and continuing until the end of February, Snowport offers affordable ice skating, curling, and — perhaps most notably — waffles. This Valentine’s Day, holiday themed waffles and some special guests helped set the mood for a love-filled evening in the winter village.
The Waffle Cabin is a cozy, rustic-themed shop that accurately represents the village aesthetic of Snowport. First a street cart in Boston’s Quincy Market, Waffle Cabin has since grown into a waffle empire, present at ski resorts from Massachusetts to Colorado. The Vermont-style waffles are served as handheld confections, drizzled in chocolate or your choice of syrupy topping. Eating the fried, sugary treats by hand fully captures the rustic mountain motif, especially as village-goers carry the food around the ice rink on their skates. As a Valentine’s Day treat, Waffle Cabin offered a special Valentine waffle with a chocolate and strawberry-caramel drizzle.
After entering and enjoying a waffle at the Waffle Cabin or a meal from Oath Pizza next door, skate rentals and an indoor area are located just a few steps away. While smaller than Boston Common’s Frog Pond, the skate rink offers ample space for skaters of all skills. Plastic seals are even available to help keep your balance, either by sitting or leaning on them while skating. If real ice is not your forte, dry curling lanes are directly adjacent to the rink for some competitive family fun. The outdoor patio surrounding the rink also offers a photo-op in a vintage mountain gondola, reinforcing Snowport’s chalet-like atmosphere.
For Valentine’s Day, the gondola was filled with yellow flowers courtesy of Bumble, the online dating app. Bumble also gave away free company merchandise to advertise their dating, friend-making, and business networking platforms.
Next to Bumble’s decorated table, local artist Monique Aimee ran a free valentine station. Guests could either paint their own wooden valentine heart, or get free brush calligraphy courtesy of Aimee.
Snowport also invited Instagram sensation Joe M. Sparkes — better known as Joe Sax Boston — to join in the Valentine’s Day festivities. Sparkes filled the village with saxophone riffs. He performs at various street venues around Boston and became famous for covering Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” outside her TD Garden concert last December. When asked about his Snowport appearance, Sparkes said he was there to help spread Valentine's cheer and was grateful for the opportunity to reach a wider audience.
Luis Querubin, a Snowport staffer, said that turnout increased only slightly for the Valentine’s Day event. Querubin said the rink is the most enjoyable part of Snowport, along with the experience of being in such a beautiful city. His goal is to increase turnout in the following years.
Although only open through the end of the month, there are several special events coming up in Snowport. Make it into town to learn to curl on Feb. 22 or celebrate Mardi Gras with a celebration all day Feb. 25.

When “Survivor” premiered on May 31, 2000, “The Bachelor” did not exist. Neither did “The Amazing Race,” “American Idol,” “Project Runway,” or “Top Chef.” “Big Brother,” another eventual CBS reality juggernaut, would premiere five weeks later. But while the premiere of “Survivor”’s 40th season aired last week, “Big Brother” has churned out only 21 seasons in a nearly identical period of time.
It’s difficult to overstate the sheer force of “Survivor”’s impact on the reality TV ecosystem, particularly on the slate of shows whose “reality” element draws not on the everyday life of unordinary people but on the skills and talents of ordinary people put in extraordinary situations.
That phenomenon, however, is well-documented. What’s more elusive to the discerning general public is the almost jingoistic fervor sustained for 20 years by members of the “Survivor” superfandom.
I was less than one year old on May 31, 2000. I am told I watched the first ever “Survivor” episode — though my parentally biased sources are less than reliable — and have been devoted ever since. In our shared 20 years of life, “Survivor” and I have dealt with our fair share of doubt and misappraise.
“Why would I want to watch a show full of people in the wild who are constantly pixelated?” skeptics ask.
You’re blasphemously confused; that’s “Naked and Afraid.” “Survivor” contains the occasional pixelated boob, but only in the heat of preordained physical combat.
“Don’t they eat spiders?”
Yes, but only once a season. Sometimes twice.
“How can any show still be good after 30/35/40 seasons?”
As to what makes “Survivor” interesting season after season, entire Harvard essays could be written on the question — and have been, allegedly. An individualist analysis would thank internet heartthrob Jeff Probst, the show’s ageless host and biggest fan. But Probst, in all his greatness, steers a well-constructed ship. The longevity of “Survivor” can be boiled down to a few essential and interconnected strengths.
First, the premise is more durable, and subject to interpretation, than anything else on television. At its core, “Survivor” is both a societal microcosm and a fable of baldfaced human ambition, at turns heartwarming and upsetting, and always with the carefully edited illusion of evolving in real time. For psychologists, it’s a naturally occurring social experiment. For game theorists, it’s a rich area of study. And for the dramatists, it’s an unrivaled tale of human toil and triumph.
Indeed, if Aristotelian tragedy requires Reversal of the Situation and subsequent Recognition, nothing is more deliciously tragic than the “Survivor” blindside. The worst, or best, is when everyone but the victim can see it coming. No death of your favorite character can compare to puppy-eyed Eric Reichenbach willingly giving away his immunity necklace, which protected him from elimination, to a Siren-like cadre of powerful women who then voted him out on the spot.
Moreover, the “plots” of “Survivor” are as gleefully susceptible to online feedback as any scripted teen soap. To wit, observe the discourse surrounding “Edge of Extinction,” one of many versions of a recurring idea the show has tested out in recent years: When you’re voted out, you’re not really out, just lurking on some secondary, inferior island with a chance to return. Fans think this premise neuters the drama of Tribal Council and is thus antithetical to “Survivor”’s very essence. An entire Twitter campaign, #EndEdgeofExtinction, took hold. And Jeff Probst listened. “I hear you, we’re not going to do Edge for a while,” he said at the premiere last week. The “Survivor” nation and the “Survivor” production team are intimately acquainted, linked like a motley crew of opinionated shareholders.
This experience of collective investment is part of what makes “Survivor”’s missteps feel all the more upsetting. The show’s mishandling of inappropriate touching by a contestant last season — not to mention the situation’s unprecedented complexities in the context of the game itself — requires its own think piece, and has spurred many. “Survivor”’s passionate fanbase is also its strongest critic, holding this reality show to a real-life ethical standard that should be, and is often not, the norm for the genre.
Ultimately, “Survivor” keeps innovating, twisting the knife in new and often frustrating ways. Some surprises read as the ultimate sin: game manipulation by the producers to keep better players in longer, like Edge of Extinction or that horrendous Final Four firemaking challenge. But some — Hidden Immunity Idols, Exile Island, even the Blood vs. Water idea (test your marriage!) — stuck around from season to season, making great TV even twistier. Change is the engine that drives a timeless core premise.
On a show that’s often about deception, no one’s been craftier than “Survivor” itself. It’s kept us rabidly delighted for 40 seasons by following its own mantra: outwit, outplay, outlast.

Dwight Macdonald. Chant the name three times in an academic setting and watch the paint run off the walls. This is not so gross an exaggeration: When the academy conjures its tutelary deity of the high-brow, low-brow distinction, it squirms with self-doubt and self-defense at the possibility that the canon is still that walled garden cultivated only by elites. A cultural critic of the midcentury New York intellectual breed, Dwight Macdonald levelled many a fabulous polemic against so-called “sham art.” The cultural products Macdonald went to war against included the low-brow trash filling the bins of mass culture, anti-art manufactured so plainly for the purpose of turning a profit that Macdonald nicknamed it Masscult, careful not to grant it the status of “culture" at all. And then there is Macdonald’s archenemy, Midcult, or middle-brow culture. Like Masscult, Midcult is also a manufactured, profit-seeking pseudoculture, but, unlike the baseborn, unassuming low-brow, Midcult is convinced of its own sophistication. It is shallow, formulaic, usually enjoyable, and sometimes quite smart entertainment that attempts to copy the depth and value of high culture. Keyword: attempts. Macdonald, the good doctor, famously diagnosed Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea,” H.G. Wells, and Andy Warhol with stage four Midcult.
Macdonald’s cultural criticism has been presumed dead for decades. After all, his admittedly snobbish views are in some senses antithetical to the project of the liberal arts. However, even as the literary canon disagrees with Macdonald on the point of “The Old Man and the Sea,” its discriminatory tastes still uphold a kind of high-brow, low-brow distinction. In fact, we, as individual cultural consumers, are somewhat brow-bent. When I declare the majesty of Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma” and denounce Michael Bay’s “6 Underground” as a garbage fire, am I not signaling my own high-minded refinement? Surely, Macdonald would find it splendidly ironic that today, the high-low dichotomy is taken up by popular culture warriors: people like you and me, like everyone who, in daily life, recommends slates of “visionary” indie films to our friends. We might throw in the occasional action-packed thrill ride, but only with the self-edifying caveat that it is, of course, a big-budget lobotomy, but if you’re in the mood, who knows? Filling out our Oscar ballots, we render the world of film our playground for trying out that Macdonald-esque pomposity. It’s fun and freeing and provides perhaps the most democratic thing any one cultural consumer could hope for — the right to be an absolute snob. Or movie buff. Whatever the euphemism.
Case in point: the current Star Wars crisis. I know of no other cinema-cultural firestorm in our lifetime so powerful as to prompt petitions, so traumatic as to retroactively ruin childhoods, and so gloriously relevant to old Macdonald’s body of work. With a slightly disastrous sequel trilogy behind us, there is clear consensus among Star Wars fans that Disney’s dominion over Lucasfilm is generally a bad thing — that the box office behemoth (and now, streaming giant) has destroyed Lucas’s beloved brainchild, tearing the heart from the Skywalker saga and replacing it with trite dialogue, hollow characters designed to sell toys, and anticanonical plot points that reject the decades of lore which made Star Wars a living mythos. The Star Wars crisis has come to a head, but perhaps there’s more to the issue than poor leadership or creative bankruptcy. Perhaps the crisis of Star Wars is not one of territorial dispute or even of legitimacy, but of taste. When a franchise is so integrated into a culture’s collective consciousness, has its lore left the realm of folk in which it began? Was the watering down of Star Wars inevitable precisely because of its mass cultural appeal?
Well, consider Macdonald’s Masscult and Midcult a dyad in the force — for, to honor the incomparable Prequel Memes subreddit, this is where the fun begins. Masscult is culture imposed from above by money-making machines like Disney, with the goal of reaching the widest possible audience. It is, as its name suggests, an “expression of the masses,” not of the people. This is a crucial distinction that typifies the difference between Masscult and “people’s art.” The latter is folk art. Essentially low-brow but with humanistic authenticity, folk art grows from below as a “spontaneous expression of the people.” When Macdonald was writing, he declared jazz to be the only major folk art remaining in the U.S. What makes Disney’s Masscultic rendition of Star Wars so disheartening to so many is the (highly disputable) fact that Star Wars began as folk art.
Once upon a time, George Lucas’s vision, with the help of a charismatic cast and storied team of passionate film artisans, became 20th century American mythology. The folk hero, Luke Skywalker, was of the people, for the people, and by the people. So enmeshed in our cultural fabric, Star Wars lore spun out of the hands of the mythmaker himself, Lucas, and was expounded upon in a profusion of comic books and graphic novels authored by devotees. Oh, the halcyon days of yore. Then, Disney bought it for four billion dollars and declared much of the expanded universe noncanonical. (Insert photo of George Lucas standing next to Mickey Mouse with a lightsaber here.) The tragedy of Star Wars is that the very universality that allowed it to evolve from folk art to bona fide mythology is the same homogenizing quality that turned it to the dark side of Masscult.
The backlash prompted by this last installment in the Disney sequel trilogy proves that “Star Wars: The Fall of Folk Art” does not end at mere Masscult, for the franchise has slipped into something even less comfortable. Let’s just say that if Masscult is Senator Palpatine, then Midcult is the cloaked Darth Sidious. Like its alter ego, Midcult is formulaic, endlessly enjoyable, and beholden to but a single standard: popularity. (One billion dollars at the global box office, anyone?) But what makes Midcult so much more insidious than Masscult, according to Macdonald, is its ability to fool both its producers and its consumers. It believes itself to be a democratizing force for good in the world, spewing themes of unity and human betterment, while it virtually destroys difference. It operates by the Law of the Built-In Reaction, telling its audience how to feel instead of inspiring those feelings (think of sentimentality versus genuine sentiment).
One of the hallmarks of Midcult is the use of love as a deus ex machina, resolving any problem the plot is too lazy to approach full force. If none of these terms and conditions seem to apply to Disney’s Star Wars, there is an additional zinger from Macdonald that I believe undoubtedly applies — namely, that Midcult both fears and panders to the masses. It is wary of their sheer numbers insofar as those multitudes are able to make a box office flop at the same time that it patronizes popular tastes. Midcult is the feel-good popcorn flick that’s fun for the whole family (even to the point of infantilizing adults, Macdonald aptly notes), and that bears an enticing message of unity and group harmony. The catch? It’s a marketing phenomenon more than it is an art. And yet, as Macdonald wrote, “There is something damnably American about Midcult.”

We might throw in the occasional action-packed thrill ride, but only with the self-edifying caveat that it is, of course, a big-budget lobotomy, but if you’re in the mood, who knows? Filling out our Oscar ballots, we render the world of film our playground for trying out that Macdonald-esque pomposity. It’s fun and freeing and provides perhaps the most democratic thing any one cultural consumer could hope for — the right to be an absolute snob. Or movie buff. Whatever the euphemism.
Case in point: the current Star Wars crisis. I know of no other cinema-cultural firestorm in our lifetime so powerful as to prompt petitions, so traumatic as to retroactively ruin childhoods, and so gloriously relevant to old Macdonald’s body of work. With a slightly disastrous sequel trilogy behind us, there is clear consensus among Star Wars fans that Disney’s dominion over Lucasfilm is generally a bad thing — that the box office behemoth (and now, streaming giant) has destroyed Lucas’s beloved brainchild, tearing the heart from the Skywalker saga and replacing it with trite dialogue, hollow characters designed to sell toys, and anticanonical plot points that reject the decades of lore which made Star Wars a living mythos. The Star Wars crisis has come to a head, but perhaps there’s more to the issue than poor leadership or creative bankruptcy. Perhaps the crisis of Star Wars is not one of territorial dispute or even of legitimacy, but of taste. When a franchise is so integrated into a culture’s collective consciousness, has its lore left the realm of folk in which it began? Was the watering down of Star Wars inevitable precisely because of its mass cultural appeal?
Well, consider Macdonald’s Masscult and Midcult a dyad in the force — for, to honor the incomparable Prequel Memes subreddit, this is where the fun begins. Masscult is culture imposed from above by money-making machines like Disney, with the goal of reaching the widest possible audience. It is, as its name suggests, an “expression of the masses,” not of the people. This is a crucial distinction that typifies the difference between Masscult and “people’s art.” The latter is folk art. Essentially low-brow but with humanistic authenticity, folk art grows from below as a “spontaneous expression of the people.” When Macdonald was writing, he declared jazz to be the only major folk art remaining in the U.S. What makes Disney’s Masscultic rendition of Star Wars so disheartening to so many is the (highly disputable) fact that Star Wars began as folk art.
Once upon a time, George Lucas’s vision, with the help of a charismatic cast and storied team of passionate film artisans, became 20th century American mythology. The folk hero, Luke Skywalker, was of the people, for the people, and by the people. So enmeshed in our cultural fabric, Star Wars lore spun out of the hands of the mythmaker himself, Lucas, and was expounded upon in a profusion of comic books and graphic novels authored by devotees. Oh, the halcyon days of yore. Then, Disney bought it for four billion dollars and declared much of the expanded universe noncanonical. (Insert photo of George Lucas standing next to Mickey Mouse with a lightsaber here.) The tragedy of Star Wars is that the very universality that allowed it to evolve from folk art to bona fide mythology is the same homogenizing quality that turned it to the dark side of Masscult.
The backlash prompted by this last installment in the Disney sequel trilogy proves that “Star Wars: The Fall of Folk Art” does not end at mere Masscult, for the franchise has slipped into something even less comfortable. Let’s just say that if Masscult is Senator Palpatine, then Midcult is the cloaked Darth Sidious. Like its alter ego, Midcult is formulaic, endlessly enjoyable, and beholden to but a single standard: popularity. (One billion dollars at the global box office, anyone?) But what makes Midcult so much more insidious than Masscult, according to Macdonald, is its ability to fool both its producers and its consumers. It believes itself to be a democratizing force for good in the world, spewing themes of unity and human betterment, while it virtually destroys difference. It operates by the Law of the Built-In Reaction, telling its audience how to feel instead of inspiring those feelings (think of sentimentality versus genuine sentiment).
One of the hallmarks of Midcult is the use of love as a deus ex machina, resolving any problem the plot is too lazy to approach full force. If none of these terms and conditions seem to apply to Disney’s Star Wars, there is an additional zinger from Macdonald that I believe undoubtedly applies — namely, that Midcult both fears and panders to the masses. It is wary of their sheer numbers insofar as those multitudes are able to make a box office flop at the same time that it patronizes popular tastes. Midcult is the feel-good popcorn flick that’s fun for the whole family (even to the point of infantilizing adults, Macdonald aptly notes), and that bears an enticing message of unity and group harmony. The catch? It’s a marketing phenomenon more than it is an art. And yet, as Macdonald wrote, “There is something damnably American about Midcult.”

Harvard has some hiring to do. With the announcement that Eliot House Faculty Deans Douglas A. Melton and Gail A. O’Keefe will step down at the end of the spring semester, the College must now replace five sets of faculty deans in Eliot, Cabot, Kirkland, Quincy, and Dunster Houses. Faculty deans play an integral role in House life; we have seen how they can have a large, tangible effect on the student experience, both for better and for worse. In light of the position’s considerable power, the task of selecting five new sets of faculty deans is a massive undertaking that will directly impact a significant proportion of the current and future undergraduate population, leaving a lasting cultural imprint on our University.
Filling five vacancies at once presents a unique opportunity for the College to improve representation in its leadership in an impactful, holistic way. The incoming faculty deans could represent diverse races, genders, ethnicities, ages, nationalities, and academic disciplines — creating House leadership that is more reflective of the diversity of the undergraduate student body. We believe there is value in students being able to see themselves in their faculty deans. If the College believes this as well, now is a prime opportunity to demonstrate that belief.
Additionally, the College has the opportunity in making these choices to reflect upon and clearly lay out its expectations for faculty deans. Their role is so large, yet so incredibly vague in its jurisdiction. Previous faculty deans have outlined what they believe are the responsibilities associated with the role, and we would appreciate similar clarification from the College, especially in the wake of conflicts between House leaderships in recent semesters.
Despite the excitement of these opportunities, we cannot overlook the benefits of having seasoned faculty deans at the helm of House life, as their position requires that they take on a pseudo-parental role in their House. As such, faculty deans’ performance may be enhanced with experience, as they might need time to adapt to their new roles. To that end, while we understand the need for periodic reviews to assess the condition in the House, we believe that the five- year, once-renewable contractual term limit on faculty deans’ tenures is unproductive, and a likely contributor to the upheaval in leadership we are currently witnessing.
We hope that the incoming deans will make an effort to ensure that House community and traditions are not lost in the transition. These traditions include everything from the quirky Mather Lather, to the more upscale Thursday Lowell House Tea and Eliot House Fête formal. There is value in preserving such traditions, and we hope that residents of the Houses receiving new deans will feel a sense of continuity between the culture of the House under both the old and new House deans.
Amid the selection process, we appreciate that the University is allowing students to have input into nominating future faculty deans. As faculty deans play an instrumental role in shaping the lives of undergraduates, it only seems appropriate that their voices are heard in selecting those who will be part of their family here at Harvard.
The appointment of five new faculty deans has enormous potential to both diversify Harvard’s leadership and breathe new life into campus culture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winter is what the Harvard student from California or Florida fears most. The natural phenomenon that erodes all the glamour and prestige of our name and forces us to confront why we are actually here, slugging through the frigid days. Winter shows that Harvard is great, not because of its reputation, but for its lived experience: unparalleled opportunities, an inspiring faculty, and most importantly, a fascinating collection of students.
At the beginning of the semester the sticky summer air of Massachusetts filled campus. Lowell residents complained that they had air conditioning, but it was not turned on. The rest of us complained that we did not even have fans. Either way, step counts were high as students happily wandered around campus, the weather a largely absent factor in their lives. The trees were green and the days were long; the only problem was the understanding of the evanescence of such pristine circumstances.
But, the summer was no time for gloom. After all, soon to follow was autumn, a season of immense beauty, bringing the exciting prospect of wearing new colors or one’s favorite sweater that had been tucked away since April. Winter was half a year away, or so it was supposed to be. Then right as the foliage sorted into a perfect mix of yellow, orange, and red the sun set at 5:30, and a day later at 4:30. There was no warning that returning to one’s dorm after a 3:00 class would require a flashlight.
As quickly as autumn began it ended, and we were dropped into the dark chasm of winter. It is normally understood that animals, such as geese, migrate south for the winter. But interestingly, the Canadian variety seems to emerge during the wintertime. The need for warm coats and hats accompanies a shift in conversation and behavior. Students from the Quad no longer savor the opportunity to take in their surroundings — instead they huddle together waiting for the shuttle. Freshmen, from warm places, confront the reality of facing snow for the first time, a battle for which they are completely unprepared. Others decry the sadness induced by the shift in climate. Winter, they assert, is the season of death. Maybe it is worth it for the benefits of the rebirth of spring, but it is a costly sacrifice as it lasts. Winter is for hibernating, for retreating to a place where it does not encroach, and waiting until it has receded. One wants to skip winter, to get back to the three quarters of the year (or, more accurately, one half in Massachusetts) that has trees with leaves and optional jackets. Winter is so awful that it might be the biggest reason not to come to Harvard. Why should one brave the misery handed down to us by Mother Nature when she is so kind to the residents of Palo Alto?
Yet winter, as it manifests in the actions and discussions of students, is completely ill-conceived. It is not death that makes way for rebirth, but transformation in its own right. Winter is the shedding of excess. Winter is essentialist, and it pushes everything and everyone to search for what they are in their core. What is the component of the tree that makes it such? What makes us happy? If there is no daylight and we cannot go outside and play, what is it that we have left to enjoy? If the winter robs Harvard of all of its comforts, what is left that makes this university exceptional?
In a way, the snow answers that question for us. After the winter decorticates us with the sting of the cold and the bite of the wind, it equalizes everything. The sheet of snow takes no concern for what is below it. Snow returns the possibility of playing outdoors. Snow shows us the outlines of the steam tunnels in the Yard that would otherwise be hidden. Snow demonstrates that something need not be ornate in order to be beautiful. The minimal and monotone, the undecorated and unsurprising, can be the greatest thing. And while snow may cover everything, it forces what is deep to be revealed. By removing any external differentiation between two objects, their innate qualities become clear and we have a deeper understanding of them. The winter is not death. It is the birth of the internal, the ignored, and the essential.
So, when the shuttle is late and you are walking back to Cabot in the cold and the dark, instead of complaining about how unfortunate these conditions are, consider your new opportunity to appreciate your school and yourself in a way untarnished by appearance.

To my Pasefika Sisters,
I know Valentine's Day has already passed, but now is as good as any time to write a love letter to you. Heaven knows it’s been long overdue.
There are so many things I want to say, but let me start with telling you how beautiful you are — and I mean each and every single one of you. You clearly are not told this enough. You’re never plastered all over Vogue. You’ve never been one of the select Cover Girls. In fact, one of the only times that your beauty is ever appreciated is when it comes in the form of an oversexualized, thinner, and lighter-skinned sister, whose culture has been taken out of context and used to “exotify” and misrepresent her — and therefore the rest of us. Speaking as one of these sisters, I’ve seen the ways I’m privileged by my lighter skin, the ways my body has been oversexualized, the ways my Samoan sei has been used to make me an “exotic island girl”, and the ways  I’ve been used as a tool to misrepresent the diverse beauty of my community. Yet, you still continue to embrace me.
We’ve been taught that there is only one way to be beautiful, but that’s only because the Western world has never been able to fully capture our beauty. They lack the vocabulary to describe it. They tremble in awe at your beautiful complexions that range from a silky caramel to a luscious dark brown. They are intimidated by the voluptuous curves that bulge out from the ie you wear. And they are jealous of the long hair that swings past your waist as well as your fierce curls that refuse to fall.
But you’ve taught me more than the different ways to be beautiful. You’ve taught me one of the hardest lessons of all — the lesson of love. In a world where the United Nations estimates that 60 to 80 percent of Pacific Islander women and girls experience sexual and/or physical abuse, we’ve been taught that true love is a myth. Speaking as a sister who has experienced such harassment at an early age, and has heard the multitude of similar stories from my fellow sisters repeated like a broken record, I know we’ve been given the impossible task of envisioning a type of love that doesn’t hurt us — one that doesn’t continuously use and abuse us. Yet, we’ve all managed to complete the impossible, and, from you all, I have learned, and continue to be reminded what true love is supposed to look like.
Aunties, you’ve taught me that true love is laughter. I see true love in the cackling that ensues from Aunty Nikki, Nadya, and Ressa after prying into my personal romantic life with each blunt, unashamed question — making sure that I have a safe, nonjudgmental space to ask taboo questions. I see it in Aunty Ruth and Aunty Debby’s pure joy and uncontrollable fit of giggles when they hear funny stories about me, my siblings, or cousins. And I see it in Aunty Tima’s booming laugh every time she joins us for Sunday toana’i and is surrounded by family.
Mom, you’ve taught me that true love is sacrifice. I see true love in the sacrifices that you continue to make for family, whether it's in sending money without question or offering yourself physically to help prepare for the next upcoming family fa’alavelave. I see it in the way you literally sacrifice your health without complaint to work insane hours and provide for me and my brothers. And I see it in the way you sacrifice the little time you get to rest just to celebrate me in my triumphs and hold me at my lowest points.
Beautiful friends and cousins, you’ve taught me that true love is togetherness. I remember seeing true love every day after high school at basketball and softball practice, when we’d sit in a line making sure every sister’s hair was braided or when we’d cram into the back of Coach’s truck to make sure every sister didn’t have to ride the bus late alone. I see true love in the long sleepless nights I spend talking story with my cousins that I grew up with, as we reminisce about our past memories and enjoy late ifa sessions about each other’s present life. I see it both in the crazy, spontaneous beach and waterfall adventures with my best friends from home and in the times my Pasefika sisters here in Boston have soothed my stress, whether it was through late nights of playing suipi or getting to eat the best Polynesian food on the East Coast at Somerville’s Manoa Poke Shop.
My Pasefika sisters, all I can say is thank you, fa’afetai tele lava. Thank you for creating a vision of beauty and true love that includes all of us. Because it is this inclusive vision of beauty and love that has kept me alive, both figuratively and literally, especially in a world that has shown time and time again its incapability of loving and appreciating us properly.
Thank you for validating me, loving me, and keeping me going. I love you and hope someday the world learns to love you as much as I do.
With much alofa,
Gabby

Harvard police arrested a man for trespassing in the Smith Campus Center Thursday morning after a physical altercation, drawing criticism from some eyewitnesses.
At 11:40 a.m. on Thursday, an officer recognized Tyrique Simmons — who had “an active trespass warning for all Harvard University property” — and apprehended him, according to the HUPD police log released Friday. The department stated that additional officers arrived on the scene when Simmons “engaged in physically combative behavior” after police conducted a field interview and informed him he was being placed under arrest.
Witnesses said the officer who identified Simmons did not make an effort to inform the suspect beforehand and exerted excessive force during the arrest.
Connor J. Schoen ’21 said the arrested man was walking through the main corridor of the center wearing a Harvard sweatshirt and carrying a skateboard when police told him to get on the ground. Schoen said the officer “ran up” to Simmons almost immediately.
“It was very unclear as to why he was being apprehended,” Schoen said. “He was not causing a ruckus.”
A video of the incident posted to Twitter shows two officers pushing Simmons down from a sitting position on to the floor, holding him, and rolling him over as they arrested him.
“This morning in Smith Campus center the police used excessive force to arrest a black man who was apparently trespassing in the open areas of Smith,” the tweet reads.
Harvard University Police spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the incident. Simmons could not be reached for comment.
Schoen said he was “appalled” by the officers’ behavior toward Simmons.
“What happened next was extremely disturbing and really traumatizing for a lot of people watching,” he said. “He was grabbing him forcefully, screaming at him, telling him to get on the ground. Tyrique went to his knees, and was screaming, ‘Why is this happening? What did I do? What did I do?’ The officer was not answering his questions, was not providing any clarity, did not attempt to have a civil conversation with someone who wasn’t even resisting.”
Kara Bratlie — who was with Schoen at the time — said the HUPD officer called out Simmon’s name and immediately told him to get on the round.
“It happened so fast. Basically, he was on the ground and the officer was holding him with pepper spray in his hand,” she said.
Schoen wrote in an emailed statement that Smith Campus Center was a public space so many non-University affiliates like Simmons occupy the building.
“People come through from all over the place to work and eat at the many eateries inside,” he wrote.
Bratlie said she was dismayed by the officers’ behavior during the arrest.
“I was basically doing the same thing [he] was, but the officer went at him,” she said. “Why didn’t he come at me? What’s the difference?”
History Ph.D. student Laura Correa-Ochoa said that, after witnessing the event, she filed a complaint with HUPD because she was concerned about officers’ handling of the arrest.
“I think that instead of de-escalating the situation, the officers actually escalated the situation,” she said. “This wasn’t a proportionate use of force.”

After Harvard University Health Services reiterated that University-related travel to China is “strongly discouraged” due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Director of the Harvard Beijing Academy Jennifer L. Liu informed participants that the 2020 iteration of the summer program is canceled.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 and HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen sent expanded guidance concerning the outbreak — which was officially named COVID-19 last week — in an email to Harvard affiliates Thursday. This is the third such communication regarding coronavirus sent by the pair over the past month.
The administrators wrote that University-related travel to mainland China requires approval from the Provost.
In light of the updated guidance and concerns about student health and safety, Liu informed HBA participants of the program’s cancellation, according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
“Given the logistical complexities of our large summer program and the prolonged uncertainty, the operation of our 2020 program is not feasible,” Liu wrote.
Garber and Nguyen also advised Harvard affiliates who returned from a trip to China on or after Jan. 19 to submit a health form to HUHS if they have not already done so.
In an interview Wednesday, Nguyen said few students from the College have been affected by coronavirus concerns because most had already arrived on campus by the time the disease had “exploded.”
For those few students who had not, HUHS recommended a period of self-isolation in their own homes.
“The recommendation is to stay at home and not participate in classes, in group activities and so on, for the duration of the self-isolation period,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen and Garber wrote in the Thursday email that faculty and staff members should be flexible in dealing with students who are affected by the outbreak. They also urged Harvard affiliates to be respectful of others, including people wearing face masks around campus.
“Do not assume that a person wearing a face mask is infectious, or that they should be avoided,” they wrote. “Treating all members of our community with respect and consideration is as important now as at any other time.”
HUHS aims to keep Harvard affiliates updated on the coronavirus situation through periodic emails and collaboration with campus partners, according to Nguyen.
“Our effort has been to make sure that people know what they need to know but not worry more than they need to worry,” Nguyen said.

Harvard Law School students, faculty, and administrators have condemned sexual harassment in the judicial system following Law School graduate Olivia A. Warren’s Feb. 13 testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.
Warren worked as a clerk for federal judge Stephen R. Reinhardt after her graduation from the Law School in 2017 up until his death in 2018. She testified that she experienced repeated instances of sexual harassment during her time in his chambers, alleging that the judge personally insulted her and ridiculed the #MeToo movement.
“On my first day, I was confronted with a drawing of a sine curve taped above the computer in my office to which two dots had been added by the judge so that the curves resembled breasts,” Warren said in her testimony. “The judge himself asked me whether the drawing itself was ‘accurate’ with a look that indicated that the question was whether or not it resembled my own breasts.”
“This was only the beginning of what felt like an endless stream of comments about my physical appearance,” she said.
One day after Warren’s testimony, Law School Professor Adriaan Lanni wrote a letter to the editor of the Harvard Law Record in which she described her own experiences as a clerk for Reinhardt and applauded Warren’s willingness to testify.
“When I clerked for Judge Reinhardt 20 years ago, I remember him as having sexist assumptions about women (e.g., assuming women would not like sports, asking female clerks to make coffee),” Lanni wrote.
Lanni noted that she has praised Reinhardt to students in the past, but finds Warren’s allegations “specific and credible.”
A. Vail Kohnert-Yount, a member of the People’s Parity Project, wrote in an article for the Harvard Law Record that harassment against clerks stains the legal profession as a whole. The People’s Parity Project is a student organization that aims to end harassment and discrimination in the justice system.
“It’s no wonder that clerks, especially those in elite clerkships, are overwhelmingly white and male,” she wrote. “Harassment and discrimination systemically push talented law students and lawyers out of the pipelines to important professional and intellectual opportunities — including but not limited to clerkships — and ultimately this discrimination affects the law itself.”
Warren said in her testimony that she met with Law School administrators to report the harassment but received no follow-up.
“I believed that Harvard Law School should care about the harmful experience of one of its students and I hoped that my experience would lead the school to scrutinize potential clerkships more carefully,” she said. “Nobody has communicated to me since that meeting what, if any, steps Harvard has taken to address the issues I raised.”
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in a Thursday email to students that the school has taken active measures to assist students and alumni facing misconduct in the workplace.
“Harvard Law School is committed to helping confront the problem of judicial misconduct and to ensuring our students understand the options and support available to them,” he wrote. “We can, must, and will always seek ways to do more to help build a profession in which all are treated fairly and with dignity and have equal opportunity to thrive in their work.”

Harvard’s Dean of Students Office has appointed Craig Rodgers as Program Manager for Military Student Services, Associate Dean of Students Lauren Brandt wrote in an email to College affiliates Thursday.
Rodgers will be the first to hold the newly created position and will act as a liaison to Army, Navy, and Air Force ROTC students and others interested in serving in the military, according to Brandt.
“Craig will play a critical role in working with our ROTC cadets and midshipmen, veterans, and other students at the College who are interested in military service,” she wrote.
Prior to his appointment as Program Manager for Military Student Services, Rodgers worked as a counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel for nearly two decades.
In June 2019, the College announced it would shutter the BSC in December of that year — a move that concerned some students. The Academic Resource Center, a new academic support center, opened last August.
Rodgers enlisted in the United States Army Reserve while an undergraduate at MIT and remained an active reservist for the next ten years, according to Brandt’s email. He also participated in MIT’s Army ROTC program and received an officer’s commission upon graduation.
Harvard and ROTC have had a historically fraught relationship, holding each other at arm's length for nearly 40 years.
At the height of the Vietnam War, protests over ROTC’s involvement in the war erupted on Harvard’s campus; in 1969, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to demote ROTC to an extracurricular status.
In 1995, the University officially cut ties with the organization over its policy of excluding gay and lesbian members. Following the repeal of the U.S. military’s “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy on service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, Navy and Army ROTC returned to campus in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
In addition to his work at the BSC, Rodgers founded and led Athletic, Academic, and Personal Excellence, a program that provided varsity student-athletes with access to academic, personal, vocational, and sports counseling.
Brandt added that Rodgers’s experience both in military programs and at the University will make him a valuable resource to students.
“While this position is new, Craig certainly is not new to ROTC or to Harvard,” Brandt wrote. “Craig comes to this role with a wealth of experience.”
Correction: February 21, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to strip ROTC of its extracurricular status in 1969. In fact, the Faculty voted to demote ROTC to an extracurricular status.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than three dozen undergraduates announced this week that they would vie for the 16 open spots on Harvard’s Undergraduate Council, two candidates say they have been entered into the race unwittingly and unwillingly.
In order to be eligible to run for the UC midterm elections, students needed to attend a mandatory rules meeting on Sunday. However, two students who said they did not attend that meeting — Samyra C. Miller ’21 of Lowell House and Dhilan Ramaprasad ’21 of Mather House — have been placed on the ballot nonetheless.
Both Miller and Ramaprasad have previously served on the Council. Miller said in an interview Thursday that she originally planned to run for a seat but ultimately decided not to.
Ramaprasad, meanwhile, wrote in an email to UC election commission chair Perry M. Arrasmith ’20 that he never planned to run for a seat. He said he got onto the ballot because his friends signed him up, adding that he only found out he was a candidate after Arrasmith emailed candidates reminders on Tuesday morning before voting opened. He asked Arrasmith to be taken off the ballot about four hours before voting began.
“I’m not running. My friend keeps signing me up. Pls do remove me. God bless. Godspeed,” he wrote to Arrasmith.
Arrasmith wrote in an email to The Crimson that he did not see Ramaprasad’s email until Tuesday evening, after the ballot went live.
Miller said she did not know that she was on the ballot at all until after voting began. She reached out to Arrasmith Wednesday afternoon also asking to be taken off the ballot.
“I found out that I was on the ballot when someone else texted me about my being on the ballot,” Miller said.
According to Arrasmith, candidates cannot be taken off the ballot after voting is opened. He wrote in an email to The Crimson that students whose names end up on the ballot but who do not want to run will be withdrawn when ballots are counted.
“Once voting begins, we will not interfere with the electoral process,” he wrote.
Arrasmith sent emails to both Miller and Ramaprasad explaining the rule, leading Miller to send an email over the Lowell mailing list asking people to vote for other candidates instead.
In an email addressed to Arrasmith and also sent to a Mather mailing list, Ramaprasad called himself a “UC Candidate Non-consensual.”
“It would be a shame, Perry, if this seat were to wrongfully fall into my possession, once more,” Ramaprasad, “Mark my words, though, should this happen, I will take you and the entire UC down with me.”
The voting period for UC midterm elections ends Friday at noon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government professor Michael J. Sandel and Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center Fellow Gwyneth Williams spoke about the role of truth in politics to a crowd of more than 70 people at the Institute of Politics Thursday evening.
Sandel and Williams defended “passionate public discourse in democratic societies” but said more than facts are necessary for political discourse. Sandel said “fact-checking alone” would not be enough to combat the growing influence of political polarization and misinformation.
Sandel attributed disagreement over facts to moral and ethical divides in society.
“We don't agree on the basic facts,” he said. “We disagree on the basic facts because we have a deep divide morally and ethically.”
Facts, however, must be coordinated with a worldview to effectively convey arguments, according to Sandel. “Only when facts are connected to a view of the world that is connected to your political argument do they carry out,” he said.
Sandel also touched on the prevalence of false statements in national politics. He said President Donald J. Trump made 16,241 misleading or false statements in three years since taking office, according to the Washington Post.
Coverage of Trump’s false statements “hasn’t changed many people’s views on the president and the administration,” according to Sandel.
Bringing attention to misinformation in the media is not sufficient, according to Williams. She highlighted the importance of context when reporting.
“I think people do care about facts and truth,” she said. “Generally, I think we're in a kind of world where people want to also understand the context and the background, which is more than we give them with our very fast-rolling news.”
Attendees raised questions about polarization and misinformation, specifically as applied to topics like climate change and cultural differences.
Sandel said that as people are increasingly educated about climate change, they become more divided on the topic.
“The more people know — the better-educated people are and the more scientific background they have — the greater the disagreement about whether climate change is a problem or not,” he said. “Not less.”
Williams said that if media outlets tell a wider range of stories, there will be better understanding across cultures.

Hailed as an outstanding researcher, mentor, and friend by peers and students, Harvard Genetics professor Philip Leder ’56 died on Feb. 2 after suffering complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to his daughter Micki Leder.
Leder is survived by his wife, three children, and eight grandchildren. He was 85 years old.
A celebrated geneticist, Leder initially rose to fame through his work with Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1964, which led to the discovery of a technique for deciphering nucleotide triplets in the genetic code for all amino acids — helping scientists understand and express the language of DNA. In 1972, Leder became chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, where he studied the immune system’s ability to generate a seemingly infinite amount of antibodies.
In 1980, Leder joined Harvard Medical School as the founder of its new Genetics department. In 1983, he created the OncoMouse — a mouse genetically engineered to be more susceptible to cancer; the organism would become crucial to the study of cancer therapy.
Clifford J. Tabin, the current Genetics department chair, said Leder’s leadership helped transform the structure of all Medical School departments thanks to his emphasis on mentoring for junior faculty members.
“He was the first chair of any department to have a mentoring program for faculty, for junior faculty, which now all departments are required to have,” Tabin said. “He really changed the culture across the board at the medical school, because the other chairs either followed suit or as new chairs came in, they wanted to try and build out and replicate aspects of what Phil had done.”
Leder also catalyzed the growth of the Genetics department by outlining clear paths to tenure for new hires, according to Fred Winston, a Medical School professor and one of Leder’s first faculty hires at the Genetics department.
Winston said that before Leder’s arrival, achieving tenure was highly competitive and difficult, adding that Leder’s changes to the process “totally changed the culture” at the Medical School.
“The result of that was faculty were reluctant to teach and spend time on other scholarly activities besides pushing their own research,” Winston said. “When Dr. Leder moved to Harvard Medical School, he totally changed the culture in that, for every junior faculty hired in the Genetics department, it was clear that if they achieved at a high level as judged by people at Harvard and the outside world, that there would be a clear and definite possibility of getting tenure.”
Those who worked with Leder also noted his brilliance as a teacher who could make complex scientific ideas easy to grasp.
Ilan R. Kirsch, the senior vice president of translational medicine at Adaptive Biotechnologies and a postdoctoral fellow with Leder at NICHD, praised Leder’s ability to efficiently present and solve scientific problems.
“In addition to his scientific insight and acumen and integrity, Phil really was one of the most lucid, articulate presenters of scientific information that I’ve ever heard, and certainly was, to some extent, a role model in that regard,” Kirsch said.
Beyond his academic work, however, Leder is remembered by students, colleagues, and friends as an involved and caring mentor.
Winston recalled a poster session he participated in to recruit graduate students to research groups. When no students approached his poster at first, Winston said, he felt “kind of lonely” – that is, until Leder stepped in.
“Phil, supportive as he is, went and found two graduate students who were looking at another poster and brought them over to mine, saying, ‘Here’s a new junior faculty who you should get to know,’” Winston said. “He brought them over to my poster, and those became my first two graduate students.”
Cynthia C. Morton — a professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School and a former member of Leder’s research group at Harvard — said she experienced a “positive, healthy family culture” while working in Leder’s laboratory.
Morton said one instance of Leder’s immense concern for others occurred when a hurricane hit the area surrounding his laboratory.
“He was walking through his lab, making sure everybody got out,” Morton said.
Colleagues also said Leder left a legacy at the Medical School and beyond by advising many mentees who worked in his research groups.
Richard L. Maas, the chief of the genetics division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a former member of Leder’s Harvard research group, said he remembered many pieces of wisdom Leder passed on to others.
“There were a lot of important, powerful lessons that he imparted to his trainees,” Maas said. “How to pick a problem, when to persevere, when to call it quits on something that’s not working, how to share credit, how to collaborate, these kinds of things.”
Those who knew Leder said he had an compelling and motivating sense of humor.
Harvard Genetics professor Jonathan G. Seidman ’71, a former member of Leder’s lab at NICHD, remembered Leder’s talent for seeing the funny side of any situation.
“Phil was really funny,” Seidman said. “He had lots of good stories. People enjoyed being with him. It was just a fun place, and he had a very wry sense of humor. I don’t know how to capture that, but he was really good at finding the humorous parts of anything, including a scientific problem that he thought was humorous.”
Like Seidman, many of Leder’s mentees said they were proud to have worked under him — not just because of his numerous scientific accomplishments, but in light of his personal presence.
“He was a giant, and yet, very modest and humble at the same time,” Morton said. “And I couldn’t have been prouder at any moment to say, ‘I was a postdoc with Phil Leder.’ I just couldn’t wait to tell somebody that, because he was so special.”

The College granted Kirkland House preliminary approval to change its shield, capping a years-long effort by students and House affiliates to redesign the emblem due to its resemblance to the Confederate flag.
In an email to Faculty Deans Verena A. and Tom C. Conley, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana assented to the new design and lauded the pair for creating a “welcoming and inclusive” House environment.
“Kirkland is free to use the alternative shield,” he wrote. “I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge all your efforts in engaging Kirkland in thinking about symbols.”
The heraldic artist Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, class of 1895, designed the original Kirkland shield while he was a member of the Committee on Arms, Seal, and Diplomas. It features the Kirkland family crest overlaid with the cross of the Bishop of Carlisle — the Scottish home of the Kirkland family.
The design — a cross adorned with three stars — has sparked some controversy over the years due to complaints that it resembles the flag of the Confederate States of America.
The redesign features three stars — arranged in an inverted triangle position — emblazoned on a black and crimson background.
Verena said in an interview Thursday that the House selected the new design with extensive input from House affiliates. Those efforts included two House-wide town halls in November 2019, student questionnaires, and individual and group meetings to gather feedback.
House affiliates mainly objected to the emblem’s cross, according to Conley. She said that it was the most “salient feature” in calls for change.
“It became more or less apparent that the removal of the bar was important to everybody,” she said. “In the spirit of diversity and inclusion, we cannot have a cross since that appeals only to a certain segment of the population.”
Conley and Kirkland House Committee Chair Andrea J. Zhang ’22 presented the design to a meeting of the Committee on Student Life last Thursday.
Zhang said she believes the original design diminished Kirkland residents’ public House pride.
“People always make fun of Kirkland House during their Housing Day videos for our shield, so people don’t always want to say that they’re in Kirkland,” Zhang said. “Also, some people have not been using the laptop stickers or not buying merch because they didn’t like the shield.”
The alternative shield is still awaiting approval for use in major University events like Commencement and for merchandise sold at the COOP, Zhang said. The new shield, however, is set to make its College-wide debut during Housing Day.
Conley explained that several steps remain before the House can fully transition to the new shield, adding that the process has been “long and drawn out.” The new design is currently under review by the Harvard Trademark Office, according to Conley.
Aside from logistical hurdles, Conley said House leadership is still weighing how to transition from the old design.
“You will have to retire the existing shield, and how are you going to do that, and what are you going to do about it?” she said. “How are you going to defend that to posterity?"

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after the Department of Education launched investigations into foreign funding at Harvard and Yale, experts say federal authorities have long declined to provide clear guidelines for how universities should report such gifts.
The department announced the probe last week in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow. The missive outlined the Department’s intention to enforce Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, which mandates that universities disclose all gifts or contracts over $250,000 from foreign entities.
Tobin Smith, the vice president for policy at the Association of American Universities, said universities’ foreign funding has piqued federal authorities’ interest following a February 2019 congressional hearing on China’s impact on the United States education system. Harvard is one of eight institutions that the Department of Education has begun investigating for compliance over the last year.
“There was some pressure about what the department was doing to enforce these things,” Smith said.
Terry W. Hartle, the senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, credited the recent uptick in investigations to broader changes in national security considerations.
“The view of ties between American academic and scientific institutions and foreign individuals and corporations has changed as a result of the increased emphasis on national security and preventing international espionage,” Hartle said.
Hartle said that though Section 117 has been on the books since 1986, federal authorities have seldom enforced it.
“After Congress enacted the legislation, no one paid much attention to it. Too many colleges and universities simply lost sight of it,” Hartle said. “As a result, compliance has not been as good as it should have been.”
“I have never known the Department of Education to open an investigation into the school over the failure to properly report,” he added.
Hartle and Smith also said that, in addition to a lack of enforcement, insufficient formal guidelines regarding how to report gifts and contracts from foreign entities have fazed colleges and universities for decades.
The Education Department has twice issued informal guidelines — in 1996 and 2004 — but experts say schools face gray-area dilemmas.
Both Hartle and Smith offered the example of a $1 million grant from a foreign government meted out five years, at $200,000 a year.
“Does that meet the $250,000 threshold? Because if you space it out over five years, it's $200,000,” Smith said. “Those are questions that we've tried to get answers from at the Department of Education, and nobody will respond to an institution that asked that question.”
Hartle also said the Department has not responded to questions over whether or not universities may aggregate funding data by country, rather than listing individual gifts.
“Harvard lists [gifts] by country where they originate. Other schools do the same thing — not Harvard by itself, other schools do it the same way,” he said. “Last January, we asked the DOE in a letter if this was permissible. The department never responded to our letter. Instead, in February 2020, they launched an investigation into Harvard.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to provide additional comment on the investigation or how it reports gifts. Harvard has previously confirmed that it received the Department of Education’s letter and is preparing a response.
A Department of Education spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that the department does not believe Section 117 reporting is too complicated, calling it “a very basic regulatory system.”
The Feb. 11 letter told Harvard it had 60 days to disclose all information regarding contracts and gifts from the governments and citizens of China, Iran, Qatar, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, in addition to a number individually specified foundations and universities abroad.
Brian Flahaven — the senior director for advocacy at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education — said that despite increased scrutiny, he thinks the Department is unlikely to pursue civil or criminal action if Harvard does not reply within the 60-day window.
“My sense would be that that wouldn’t be an avenue that would be pursued,” Flahaven said.

Harvard spent $595,000 lobbying in Washington, D.C., in 2019, a figure $5,000 less than its 2018 spending, according to the University’s lobbying disclosures.
Representatives from Harvard’s Office for Federal Relations, joined by University President Lawrence S. Bacow, have continued to lobby the White House and Congress on issues including immigration, student financial aid, and an excise tax on the University’s $40.9 billion endowment.
In recent months, Bacow has met with U.S. Senator Benjamin E. Sasse ’94 (R-Neb.), U.S. Representative Jamie B. Raskin ’83 (D-Md.), U.S. Representative Juan C. Vargas (D-Calif.,), and Representative Joshua K. Harder (D-Calif.), and U.S. Representative Bradley R. Byrne (R-Ala.), according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Bacow frequently visits Washington to “make the case” for Harvard’s higher-education policy priorities, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Temporary Protected Status programs, immigration, and research funding, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
DACA is an Obama-era program that allows some young undocumented people to live and work in the United States; TPS is a program that grants immigrants from certain countries protected status because they cannot return home due to circumstances like ongoing armed conflict and environmental disaster.
“President Bacow is actively engaged with members and leaders when they visit campus, as well as through correspondence and telephone conversations,” Newton wrote in an emailed statement. “In 2020, he has already traveled to DC once and likely will have other trips during the year.”
In January, Bacow penned a letter to United States President Donald Trump urging him not to expand the controversial travel ban, a federal policy announced in early 2017 that restricted entry to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries.
Harvard’s lobbying efforts in 2019 saw wins on higher education-related tax legislation. Efforts to repeal the endowment tax — which is estimated to cost the University $37.7 million over the fiscal year 2019 — still remain a work-in-progress. Passed by a Republican-controlled legislative branch 2017, the tax would levy a 1.4 percent tax on net investment income for universities with large endowments.
Bacow continues to call for a repeal of the “unprecedented and damaging tax,” according to Newton.
“Harvard is joined in these efforts by many of these schools and leading higher education associations, like AAU, ACE, and AICUM, as we work toward repeal of this tax,” Newton wrote in an emailed statement.
In 2019, the Office for Federal Relations successfully advocated for two tax changes in the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.” The act, signed into law last December, restored tax protections for scholarship grants and repealed a new tax on transportation benefits for nonprofits, according to Swain.
Harvard administrators also continued to monitor changes to financial aid policies in 2019. Trump’s Fiscal Year 2021 proposal requests $64 billion for the Department of Education, which is $7.1 billion less than the 2019 appropriation. The proposal also reduces Pell Grant funding by $2 billion.
Of all undergraduates at the College, 16 percent of students receive Pell Grants as part of their financial aid packages, according to the University’s website.
Newton wrote in an email that the plan “proposed steep cuts” in non-Defense spending below “previously approved bipartisan topline spending for FY21.”
“Like many in higher education, Harvard is concerned that it would roll back many of the increases of recent years on education spending and research,” Newton wrote. “However, there remains bipartisan Congressional support for these priorities, and we continue to work for stronger funding outcomes in the final spending legislation.”
Harvard is currently advocating for certain provisions within the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, federal legislation that governs student financial aid programs and grants to universities, according to Newton. These include expanded Pell Grants, stronger benefits for professional and graduate students, and language surrounding Harvard’s policies on single-gender social organizations.
Newton wrote that, beyond frequent travels to the nation’s capital, Bacow also meets with civic leaders when they come to campus.
“In addition, President Bacow is actively engaged with members and leaders when they visit campus, as well as through correspondence and telephone conversations,” Newton wrote. “In 2020, he has already traveled to DC once and likely will have other trips during the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new student group demanded the University disclose and divest its investments in companies tied to Israel’s presence in Palestine during the organization’s Thursday launch event.
The group — Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine — is pursuing “a campaign centered around the actualization of Palestinian liberation,” according to a mission statement posted to Medium.
Drawing more than 200 attendees, the Thursday evening launch event featured a panel of guest speakers, including two student organizers from Brown University — Yara Doumani and Anchita Dasgupta — Harvard professor Cornel R. West ’74, and Harvard Divinity School fellow Rami Younis.
Omar Barghouti — a founder of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement — also spoke to event attendees via Skype.
BDS is an international movement seeking to “end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law,” according to its website.
During the event, Barghouti criticized Harvard for being “complicit” in supporting the state of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians.
“Stopping complicity in Israel's crimes is not heroic. It's not charitable,” he said. “We're not asking Harvard to drop everything and stand with the Palestinians. We're just asking them to stop aiding our oppressors.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain did not respond to a request for comment on the allegation that Harvard is “complicit” in human rights abuses in Palestine. The extent of Harvard’s ties to Israel and companies that operate in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is unknown.
Panelists also discussed how different human rights causes are interconnected and said they believe mutual support across movements is important.
“We believe that Palestinian rights are part of justices for indigenous people across the world, for black people, for women, and for LGBT communities, for progressive choice, against discrimination, against racism of all the types,” Barghouti said. “We are proud to be part of this progressive way around the world.”
West said he believes intersectional advocacy also necessarily entails advocating against anti-Semitism.
“We want to be consistent,” he said. “We make sure we are in solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters — when they're trashed, when they’re dehumanized, when they're degraded.”
The HOOP kickoff event came a day after the first meeting of Harvard Jewish Coalition for Peace, a new student group that bills itself as an “anti-Zionist Jewish organization.”
The Harvard Jewish Coalition for Peace, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard have endorsed HOOP’s mission, according to statements on their respective Facebook pages.
West said he was encouraged to see current Harvard students pressuring the University to align its investments with their priorities.
“We got similar things going on with fossil fuel. Beautiful. Some of the things going on with prison investment. Beautiful. Now Harvard has to disinvest — should disinvest — in terms of its complicity with the Israeli occupation of Palestine,” he added.
Barghouti said the BDS movement’s mission is to condemn oppression, not oppressors.
“You want to take out the oppression from the oppressor. You don't want to take the humanity out of him or her,” Barghouti said. “We're fighting complicity and oppression. We're not fighting any identity. We're not against any group of people.”

Though hundreds of members of the Class of 2020 have suited up for Harvard’s 42 varsity athletic teams during their time at the College, more than one in four athletes ended up quitting their teams, according to online roster data.
Roughly 27 percent of current seniors — 83 out of 308 — who played a varsity sport at some point in their time at Harvard did not play for that team this academic year, according to The Crimson’s analysis. These 308 students include both recruited athletes and “walk-ons,” who joined a varsity team after gaining admission to the College.
Teams experiencing the highest rates of attrition — at least fifty percent — include women’s lightweight crew and men’s soccer. At the other end of the spectrum, field hockey and men’s basketball had perfect retention. Attrition rates were similar for men’s and women’s teams overall, roughly 28 percent for men and 25 percent for women.
Though Ivy League schools do not usually release athlete attrition statistics online, Brown University’s athletics director told the school’s newspaper in 2016 that roughly thirty percent of athletes quit their sport at Brown.
Ten former Harvard athletes in the Class of 2020 interviewed for this article described a host of factors that led them to leave their respective teams — including injuries, mental health concerns, academic and extracurricular interests, and a diminished love for their sport.
Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise wrote in an emailed statement that athletics are one of many opportunities the College offers its students and that his department supports student-athletes as they navigate Harvard.
"Athletic participation helps our students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves while they use and develop their personal, physical, and intellectual skills at Harvard,” he wrote. “[Athletics] should never be the sole reason an individual decides to attend the College. Student-Athletes must have the freedom to explore all the extracurricular and academic opportunities Harvard has to offer.”
Scalise added that he thinks a student’s decision to stay on a varsity team is a “personal one” and that his department aims to support athletes’ choices.
Scalise and Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not directly comment on the attrition data.
Nine former athletes said playing a sport for Harvard came at a substantial cost — one that they ultimately viewed as not worthwhile.
Former men’s volleyball player Erik R. Johnsson ’20 — one of two in the senior class to quit the team — said he could not justify the “20 to 25 hours” he was spending on his sport each week.
“Most athletes don't come expecting to quit at some point. But once the sheer amount of opportunity that Harvard kids get in particular kind of sets in, I think that the calculation changes a little bit,” he said.
Former football player Devin C. Judd ’20 also said he missed out on other college experiences because of his sport’s time commitment. He said he fell out of love with the game of football during his first two years on Harvard’s team. Judd said a series of injuries ultimately prompted him to step off the gridiron for good.
In the Class of 2020, 11 out of 28 members of the football team ended up quitting the team. Football, which fields the largest team at Harvard, had the greatest number of athletes who dropped their sport, though it ranked ninth percentage-wise for the Class of 2020.
Despite his passion for football, Judd said he was still “a little shocked” by the demanding expectations he felt as a student-athlete.
“I always heard how Division I sports is like a full time job,” he said. “It's something you can't really understand until you experience it.”
Though many coaches tout Harvard’s top academics to attract athletic recruits, some former student-athletes said athletics interfered with their education.
Former women’s hockey player Kyra J. Colbert ’21 said juggling academic and athletic obligations hindered her performance in both arenas and contributed to poor mental and physical health.
Twice a week during the fall of her sophomore year, Colbert said she had regular late-night meetings with her lab partners followed by early-morning weightlifting and practice. As a result, Colbert said she often got insufficient sleep and took caffeine pills to try to compensate.
“It was just a really bad experience and I was very, very unhappy. I wasn't doing well in school and I wasn't really competing well because I was just pulled too thin,” she said.
Former softball player Lindey M. Kneib ’20 said she felt isolated after she was sidelined by injuries.
“It just got really dark,” she said.
Kneib said she ultimately quit the team so she could have “one year that I'm actually happy at Harvard.”
Though she quit the team, Kneib said she has positive memories of playing softball at Harvard. She commended the University’s efforts to tailor mental health resources to student-athletes’ needs, and said her coaches and teammates valued her health over her athletic performance. Kneib also described the euphoria she felt winning the Ivy League championship her junior year.
Johnsson also described competing in the NCAA tournament his sophomore year as a college experience he will never forget.
Though Johnsson, a recruited athlete, said he believes volleyball got him into Harvard, he said he did not feel obligated to stay on the team once he no longer found it fulfilling.
“I don't feel bad that I'm not participating in the thing that eventually got me into the school because I found other ways to contribute to Harvard,” he said.
Methodology
The data includes the 308 current and former student-athletes who entered Harvard as part of the Class of 2020 whose names appeared on an Athletics Department roster published in the 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, or 2019-2020 academic years. The data included all athletes, both recruits and walk-ons.
To gather data for this article, The Crimson cross-referenced the four years of rosters, which are available on the Athletics Department website. The Crimson adjusted individual data points when interviews indicated that names were incorrectly included or omitted on the rosters.
Students whose names appeared on rosters for multiple teams were counted only once in the total number of students. Students whose names disappeared from and then returned to rosters were not counted among students who quit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the fourth-best team in the Ivy League finished with a record above .500 was in 2014. The league tends to be top-heavy; in three of the last five years, there have been two teams atop the standings with more wins than the last-placed team had losses, and the last time the worst team had a more lopsided record than the best one was in 2012. As a result, the first three iterations of the race to make the Ivy League Conference Tournament were not all that compelling. Sure, there has been some doubt about who would sneak into the tournament. Last year, for example, three teams tied for fourth, and Penn needed to sweep its homestand against Yale and Brown on the last weekend of the season to sneak in over Cornell and Brown. But the Quakers were able to do so at 7-7, and that 7-7 record would also have been good enough to make the tournament in either of its first two years, both of which featured a team under .500 in league play.
This year should end that streak. Five teams now sit at 5-3 in the league or better. All five have reasonable hopes of challenging not only for a spot in the tournament but for at least a share of an Ancient Eight championship. And outside of Brown-Yale and Penn-Princeton, all of these teams will play each other down the stretch, so drama should abound. Two of those monumental games happen this weekend, with Penn and Princeton playing Harvard in Cambridge as the Crimson seeks revenge for two tough losses a few weeks ago. With five teams between 5-3 and 6-2, it is possible, maybe even likely, that a team with eight wins will miss the tournament. Here is a look at what is at stake this weekend for all five playoff hopefuls:
Yale (18-6, 6-2 Ivy) and Brown (12-9, 5-3):
Yale and Brown have the enviable albeit somewhat hazardous distinction of getting the “don’t slip up” trip this weekend. They travel to play the New York schools, which sit at the bottom of the conference and by the numbers are worse than any Ivy League team was last season. All five of the tournament hopefuls get to play Cornell and Columbia down the stretch, and these games could prove crucial. Princeton has already lost to Cornell, and Harvard was pushed to double overtime last weekend by Columbia in Cambridge. One has to expect the New York schools to notch an upset or two down the stretch. Easy victories are rare in the Ancient Eight, particularly on the road. And that is where Yale and Brown find themselves this weekend.
Brown in particular has a lot to prove. The Bears are in many ways the odd men out in this clump of five teams. They finished fifth last year and were predicted to finish fifth this year. Their performances against Cornell and Columbia at the turn of the month were good enough to get wins but far from convincing. Brown has impressed relative to expectations, to be sure, with wins over Harvard and Penn, but their poor non-conference play and blowout loss at Princeton last Saturday means they are probably still most likely to be on the outside looking in come mid-March. A 1-1 weekend would not put them out of contention, but it could force them to win three of their last four games, three of which come against fellow tournament hopefuls. That seems like too much to ask for.
Yale, meanwhile, smoked both schools at home. By the numbers, the Bulldogs are the best team in the Ancient Eight. The statistical site Kenpom ranks Yale 46th in the country, sixty spots ahead of next-best Harvard. Yale is also a game up on the tournament bubble, which, along with their strength, makes the Bulldogs a near-lock to make the tournament. For James Jones’ team, then, this weekend is about two things: putting their 2-2 blip behind them, and reasserting themselves as the favorites to win the Ivy League championship for the first time since 2016.
Princeton (11-10, 6-2) and Penn (13-8, 5-3):
The traditional Ivy League titans have the most difficult remaining schedules of the tournament hopefuls. They’re on the road for the next two weeks against Harvard, Dartmouth, Yale, and Brown. Princeton would almost certainly be able to survive a 1-1 performance this weekend. The Tigers’ two wins over Penn in January crucially mean that they will win any tiebreaker over the Quakers. If the Tigers beat Dartmouth this weekend and then sweep the New York schools on the final weekend, they will have nine wins and be tournament-bound, regardless of how they do next weekend. Things only get interesting from a qualifying perspective if Princeton loses Friday and Saturday, which is very possible; they will be barely (if at all) favored against Dartmouth and will be significant underdogs against Harvard. And while Princeton is tied for first in the Ivy League, the Tigers should be considered heavy underdogs to win even a share of the conference championship unless they sweep this weekend, because they still have to go to Yale next weekend.
Penn is in a slightly more precarious position. The Quakers lost twice to Princeton and at home to Brown, putting them in bad shape for many of the tiebreakers they might have to face. A 1-1 weekend would likely put them in a must-win position at Brown next weekend. The Big Green thus has a big part to play this week. If Dartmouth can pick off either Princeton or Penn at home, the loser will either have to beat Harvard — which remains undefeated at home — or risk going into a second tough road weekend on the outside looking in.
Harvard (16-7, 5-3):
The Crimson barely averted disaster last weekend against Columbia. It can breathe again after the gut-wrenching end to Saturday’s game, but it has two more big games on tap this weekend against two teams it already lost to. The Penn game Saturday is especially important, as a loss to the Quakers would drop Harvard a game behind (assuming the two schools have the same result on Friday) and cost it the tiebreaker against Penn. Still, barring an 0-2 weekend the Crimson should be in very little danger of missing the tournament. Harvard will be a significant favorite in each of its next five games, and just a 3-2 stretch would put the Crimson in a good position heading into the final game of the season against Yale, where Harvard could be slight underdogs.
Because the Crimson won at Yale, Harvard is also in the best position to challenge Yale’s bid for a championship. It currently sits a game behind the Bulldogs, so the Crimson actually controls its own destiny: if it wins out, Harvard will win at least a share of the championship and finish above Yale by virtue of its two head-to-head wins. To win out, of course, the Crimson must sweep Penn and Princeton this weekend.
STAT OF THE WEEK: 17-1 -- the contenders’ joint record against Dartmouth, Cornell, and Columbia.
GAME OF THE WEEKEND: Penn at Harvard, Saturday, 7:00 PM, ESPN+

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is late December, and the Harvard men’s basketball team was in danger of seeing a statement victory over the San Francisco Dons go down the wayside. Closing out a West Coast holiday trip, the Crimson had relinquished a 15-point lead in the last seven minutes of regulation, forcing extra time.
Coach Tommy Amaker had just a few moments to address the team prior to the overtime tip-off. But as he stepped into the huddle, a familiar command came hollering out from his players.
“Five-minute overtime, Lew you have four fouls!”
Typically, it is only Amaker who can make such a proclamation. About once-a-week, the team concludes its practices by doing a simulated extra session. It is here by which tired legs and waning concentration levels are put most to the test. Common situations, such as big man Chris Lewis one foul from the limit, are prescribed. Time management skills and player composure are evaluated.
But the true payoff is when simulation becomes reality.
And as was the case in the San Francisco contest, it did not take any words from Amaker himself for the Crimson to recognize what they had practiced numerous, numerous times: getting out of overtime with a W. In the calm before the storm, a typical coach command had become a rallying cry for the players.
“[Christian] Juzang and one of them yelled at in the huddle and then we just all smiled,” Amaker recollected. “I didn't know that we were going to come out on top, but I felt very good because that’s how they were embracing it, and they worked hard.”
The Crimson rebooted accordingly in overtime, pulling out its fifth consecutive victory. Notably, it marked the team’s tenth consecutive overtime win at the time.
That streak was broken two weekends ago against Penn, but a cumulative look at Harvard’s success is quite eye-opening — Harvard has won 21 of the last 23 overtime games, and 15 of its last 16 Ivy overtime games. Since Amaker took over the team in 2007, Harvard has lost just twice in extra-time Ancient Eight contests (22-5 overall, 16-2 Ivy).
And as much as veteran experience, momentum, and a bit of luck factor into these late-game tossups, players like seniors Justin Bassey and Christian Juzang attribute a certain degree of this success to their familiarity from practice.
“I think the biggest thing is we are not going into overtime not used to playing an extra five minutes,” Juzang stated. “Regardless of the foul circumstances or whatever it might be, just being comfortable in adverse situations, I think it’s helpful.”
“We firmly believe that we're practicing that more often and harder than other teams, if they are even practicing that at all,” Bassey said. “So doing that in practice, having those reps, that experience with Chris [Lewis] fouled out, that's huge. That's what gets us going and that's why we've been so successful.”
This past weekend’s thrilling double-OT win over Columbia is just the latest example of that success. After an ice-cold second half, Harvard rallied together to score 24 points across two extra frames and spoil Lions guard Mike Smith’s 38-point performance. Critical clutch plays at the end of each overtime — the first in the form of a put-back layup from Bassey and the second through a step-back triple from sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood — stamped Harvard’s fifth conference victory.
Postgame, Kirkwood was quick to reference the five-minute overtime drill in helping him maintain a resilient mentality.
“When you're most tired, we do that drill so we can bring a lot of focus,” Kirkwood said. “It just prepares us for moments like this. Obviously you can't prepare for the fatigue you feel in double overtime [in] the last couple possessions, but you can try your best. I feel like obviously we don't want to get to that position but when we do, we were prepared for it.”
Accumulating over the past three seasons, the Crimson has collectively outscored opponents 169-130 over 10 extra-time games, suffering just one loss in that span. Harvard has had an interesting mark of success against Columbia specifically, with the two teams playing 20 extra minutes last season.
The first came about in captivating form, highlighted by then-junior Bryce Aiken’s double-pump, mid-court heave to send the contest into a third overtime. The latter overtime win was equally as consequential, with the Crimson clinching its Ivy regular-season title in the Lions’ Levien Gym. Harvard also pulled out a 75-68 victory over Penn last season after Aiken sank a corner triple to force extended action.
And with just three weeks remaining in the Ivy League regular-season slate this season, it is likely that Harvard will have to face more late-game nail-biters in its quest to reach the NCAA Tournament. Seven games in this campaign have been decided by one possession, with three finishing in overtime. In the past three weeks alone, a trio of contests have been decided by a free-throw.
Unquestionably, this team — especially the senior class — has quite comprehensively been through the ringer as far as situational basketball. But when the horn sounds and there is still basketball left to be played, the Crimson has shown an uncanny ability in most times out of none to escape unscathed.
Of course, there is no social scientist or statistician here to explain ‘how much degree of variation in overtime winning is due to the frequency of the five-minute overtime drill conducted in practice’. But as exemplified in that huddle in San Francisco, there seems to be an intangible, psychological confidence that has presently affirmed the efficacy of Amaker’s end-of-practice ‘intervention’.

POTSDAM, N.Y. — One thing the Harvard men’s hockey team lacked was a win over a top-10 foe. On Friday night, the No. 20 Crimson (12-8-6, 10-4-5 ECAC) checked that box.
Harvard defeated No. 5/6 Clarkson, 5-2, to start its infamous North Country road trip on a high note. The Golden Knights (22-7-2, 15-4-0) represent the highest-caliber opponent Harvard has defeated in 2019-2020 and the program’s first takedown of a top-five team since its Beanpot crown on Feb. 13, 2017.
The victory comes at a crucial time of jockeying for position in the conference standings — the two points enhance the Crimson’s chances of locking in a top-four seed and hence a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament.
With Friday’s result, Harvard has taken points from all 11 conference adversaries this season.
“It was a good win for us,” said Crimson forward Jack Donato. “[Clarkson is] one of the better teams in the league…. We wanted to have a good team effort. Four lines chipped in, six [defensemen], really good goalie play.”
Already ahead by two scores early in the first period, Harvard coughed up multiple east-west passes on the powerplay leading to two quality chances going the other way for Clarkson forward Zach Tsekos. Freshman goaltender Mitchell Gibson (2 GA, .946 SV%), however, kept both chances out of the Crimson net.
“I thought they had a few pretty big chances,” Gibson said. “Just kind of had a clear mind and came up when I needed to. Obviously, the two breakaways in the first, and knowing they had the number-one penalty kill in the country, I was just trying to be ready at all times.”
Having narrowly escaped a brief stretch of sloppy play, Harvard dealt another blow to its hosts. Junior winger Henry Bowlby used his speed to gain an edge on Golden Knights forward Mathieu Gosselin. A drop pass and a blocked shot left the puck lingering in the slot, where junior centerman Jack Badini picked it up and, subsequently, found twine.
Badini’s momentum-shifting goal was also the deciding strike in Friday’s affair.
“That [goal] was huge,” said Crimson sophomore forward Jack Drury. “That line has been good for us all year. Whenever they’re together, [Badini, sophomore R.J. Murphy, and Bowlby] have done a great job being hard and being fast…. [The goal] was great timing, and give Bowlby and Badini a lot of credit for making that play happen.”
Early in the middle stanza, the foes traded notches. Clarkson came out of the intermission firing after a lackluster first 20. Within two minutes, the green and gold were on the board, courtesy of a slick backhand shot that sophomore forward Anthony Callin roofed on Gibson.
Three minutes later, rookie blue-liner Henry Thrun got one back for Harvard. His wrist shot passed the officials’ review for goaltender interference and restored the Crimson’s comfortable three-goal advantage.
Toward the end of the frame, Harvard saw another could-be goal go to review; this time, senior forward Colton Kerfoot’s stuff attempt was deemed to have been saved by Kris Oldham (0 GA, 1.000 SV%), the backstop who replaced starter Frank Marotte (4 GA, .789 SV%) after Thrun’s tuck.
The Crimson ended the second period with a 31-20 lead in shots.
“The big lead kind of kept our confidence going,” Gibson said. “We just wanted to stay the course [when Clarkson scored in the second period]. We knew it was a big game, we knew we were still up. I thought it was just a good shot, nothing structurally deficient or anything like that.”
The Crimson was committed to throwing shots on goal early in Friday’s bout. Offensive-zone pressure led to the game’s first powerplay two and a half minutes after the opening puck drop.
Mere seconds into the man advantage, sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone sent a point shot toward Marotte. The puck trickled through the tender’s pads and for a moment sat in the blue paint, where Drury shoved it across the line.
Drury’s 17th of the season extends his Division-I lead in goals per game (0.74). Twenty-one of his 32 points have come on Harvard’s lethal man-up unit, which currently paces the nation at a 30.8 percent clip and has converted in all but five contests in 2019-2020.
The Harvard powerplay found success despite the formidability of the Golden Knights penalty kill, ranked number-one in the league at 91.7 percent effective.
Before the game was five minutes old, the visitors potted another puck to silence the boisterous Cheel Arena crowd. The culprit was yet another Jack — he of the Donato variety.
The winger forced a turnover on the forecheck. With the puck at the bottom of the left circle, he hesitated, took it around the cage, and forced home a wrap-around attempt.
“They were a little fidgety back there [on defense] to start the game,” Donato said. “[My linemates] did a really good job forechecking them…. I just wanted to get a puck on the net. [Goaltending coach Brian Robinson] puts the scouting report out: slow moving post-to-post, so we wanted to try to take advantage of that early.”
Donato finished with a game-high two goals, as he also potted the empty-netter to seal the triumph.
Both Rathbone and first-year forward Nick Abruzzese had productive nights, pocketing two assists apiece. The former, with seven points (2–5—7) in his last four outings, is one of just five rearguards in the NCAA to be at or above a point-per-game pace. Meanwhile, the latter continues a stellar freshman campaign and torrid stretch of late — Abruzzese leads college hockey in points since Dec. 1 with 28 (11–17—28).
After an uplifting win, the Crimson will take its productive group down the road to Canton, N.Y. for a Saturday matchup with St. Lawrence. While on paper the Golden Knights appear the more competitive North Country opponent, an equally valuable two ECAC points are on the line.
“We’re not really looking too far ahead,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “There are two teams in front of us, Cornell and Clarkson. We’ve played well against [them] in our last two meetings. But realistically, that means nothing. So, we have to earn our way just to finish in the top four in the [ECAC] standings.”

There’s a million different things happening on campus everyday, and it’s hard to plan your schedule around lecture, extracurriculars, and that annoying 6 p.m. section you have. Fortunately, we students are not alone in this complicated world. From online calendars to whiteboard calendars to the teeny planners that fit in your pocket, there’s an organizer for everyone out there. Whatever your organizing method of choice may be, here’s what it says about you.
The Gcal Guru 
Gcal? More like magi-cal. Let’s be honest. With classes, clubs, and personal time to manage, if your Google calendar isn’t your best friend, you’re missing out. Gcal can make the most disorganized people look like they’re smooth-sailing through life. If this is your tool to stay on top of things, we know you might not be the most organized, but you’re really really trying.
The Paper Planner
Equipped with your monthly paper planner, colored Muji pens, highlighters, and tiny post-it notes, we know you’re on top of your stuff. You could teach a whole seminar on staying organized. This color-coded life-saver is your most prized possession, and you literally cannot function without it.
The Camera Queen
Why take notes when you can just take a picture? In this ~digital age~, paper is overrated and so is actually writing things down. If you’re one of these people who refuses to keep a calendar and instead has a running list of appointments in your camera roll, either you’ve fully embraced technology, or you’re just too busy for a calendar.
The Helping Hand(s)
If you’re one of those people with ink all over your hands, we’ve noticed you. Writing notes on your hands keeps you organized, and, better yet, you’re doing yourself and the environment a service by saving paper. Just make sure you’re using a permanent marker. We would hate for your weekend plans to be washed away in the shower.
The Most Impressive of All
Don’t worry, we haven’t forgotten about you. There are a few of us out there who would rather not use an organizer at all. Why rely on a calendar to figure out where to be in an hour when you’ve got your good ol’ brain? If you’re running exclusively on your photographic memory, we are truly impressed. Teach the rest of us average humans your ways, please.

As the semester gets busier and busier, Cambridge’s temperatures only keep plummeting. The last thing anyone wants to do is be colder, let alone take cold showers. But after hearing about all of the purported benefits of cold showers – faster muscle recovery, increased energy, softer hair – we had to try it for ourselves, even at the risk of frostbite.
Days 1-2
Ellen: The moment I stepped into my shower, I screamed so loudly that my roommate ran in to check that I was okay. It was the shortest shower I’ve ever taken, marked by screams and gasps every time I had to rinse off. Even on the first day, I could tell it would be a tough week.
Janani: I underestimated how cold the shower would be. It only lasted two minutes, but it felt like eternity and I pretty much screamed the entire time. I have a hallway bathroom, which means I scared everyone who came into the bathroom hoping to mind their own business on a Monday morning.
Days 3-4
Ellen: These days weren’t quite as awful as the first day, but pretty miserable nonetheless. My showers shortened against my will, but on the bright side, I had much more time to get ready in the mornings. On top of improved efficiency, I noticed that my skin and hair were already softer and appeared to be more moisturized. Skincare perks, I guess?
Janani: By this point, I had a full-on cold. I don’t think the shower made me sick, but it was not making things any better. Fortunately, there was less screaming because I knew what to expect. I took the shortest showers possible and then a lot of NyQuil. I noticed my face looked really red, but we’ll never know if that was because of the showers or the sickness.
Days 5-7
Ellen: I stopped needing coffee. That’s right – before this, I was blowing through my BoardPlus like there was no tomorrow, but for the duration of this week, I was feeling energized and alert even when in class. I missed hot showers, but I was starting to get used to the cold (and maybe secretly enjoying it?).
Janani: Over halfway in, I began to recover and see the brighter side of this situation. The whole soft-hair-thing is not a myth. My hair felt much softer, less frizzy, and more manageable. I still didn’t look forward to my shower, but I am not complaining about the aftermath.
Final Thoughts
Ellen: It was every bit as awful as I expected, but at the same time, I would do it again. The transition from hot to cold showers was drastic, but once I got used to the water temperature, the whole experience wasn’t as unpleasant as I had initially imagined. After going back to hot showers, I only use warm instead of hot water, and my showers are shorter than before, both of which have huge environmental benefits. I would honestly be down to try again – once it’s not 10 degrees below freezing.
Janani: This week had its ups and downs. If I had not fallen sick, I think the whole experience would have been more enjoyable. Because I shower in the morning, I felt more awake going to class and for the rest of the day. My showers were also significantly more efficient and I saved both time and water. That being said, when it’s cold outside, it sucks to be even colder. I’m proud of us for sticking to it for the whole week, and I would be willing to try again when the weather is warmer!
