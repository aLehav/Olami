After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite its bold title, girl in red’s latest single “You Stupid Bitch” lacks the innovative songwriting that fans have come to know and love. This is the second single to be released from her upcoming debut album “if i could make it go quiet,” which Ulven describes as a “banger album.” This description certainly matches the artist’s new, hard-hitting sound that deviates from the pared-down instrumentals of her prior work and leans into electric guitar along with more aggressive vocals. Upbeat percussion makes “You Stupid Bitch” a good song for dancing and pretending that you’re the main character in a coming-of-age indie film. But when the well-rounded accompaniment is set aside, the lyrics fall short.
Ulven’s songwriting normally delivers on brilliant storytelling. She writes openly about her experiences with mental health struggles and queer romance, utilizing a visual and sensual language that makes personal moments accessible to any listener. Her lyrics are often very repetitive, with short verses and multiple rounds of longer choruses, but the cleverness of her writing makes up for any lack of variety.
“You Stupid Bitch” maintains Ulven’s trademark vulnerability by expressing a stormy internal dialogue, but it lacks creativity. The song consists primarily of the repeated line “You stupid bitch, can’t you see the perfect one for you is me?” with little descriptive language. In a world overflowing with songs about unrequited love, one must be truly inventive to stand out among the rest. Unfortunately, the lyrics of “You Stupid Bitch” don’t quite make the cut. The song is essentially an angstier version of Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me,” echoing the frustration of watching someone you love struggle through relationships when you know that you’d be the perfect option.
Without Ulven’s brave — and successful — departure from her bedroom pop roots, the impact of this song would be lost. Incorporating heavier instrumentation brings her into the realm of rock, establishing the angry tone that underlies her vocals. “You Stupid Bitch” is emblematic of significant growth in her understanding of instrumental composition, but the same cannot be said about the single’s lackluster lyrics.

"Skam,” a Norwegian anthology series, is the greatest teen show ever created. Teen dramas are consistently burdened by ridiculous overdramatics (”Riverdale”) or writing that sounds like one of those twitter machine learning bots (“Grown-ish”), but across the Atlantic viewers can find a series that actually encapsulates the experience of being a teenager. Literally translated as “shame,” showrunner and writer Julie Andem created the series as an exploration of the pressures, entanglements, and fears faced by Norwegian teens and, in doing so, created an always-authentic and remarkably international look into teenage angst.
Every teen drama, no matter how ridiculous, is ultimately about the transition to adulthood and finding one's identity while doing so. The allure of the subgenre is a sort of falsified nostalgia. Chances are, the viewer’s teenage self was not prom royalty, never battled an anarchist coup with the girlies, and never saved their boarding school with magic fairy powers. However, there is something nostalgic about watching someone else do these things, allowing the viewer to project their fond memories of transition onto familiar characters.
"Skam" allows the viewer to project seamlessly, as the primary goal of the series is to serve as a conduit between reality and the screen: At every point, the writing, the acting, and the production are made to reflect that realism. There is something vaguely therapeutic about watching a character that was just like you having fun, living excitedly, and experiencing happy endings.
The series follows a loosely-tied group of friends at a competitive secondary school in Oslo, with each season focusing on a new character. The four seasons include Eva exploring friendship, Noora balancing independence and relationships, Isak accepting his sexuality, and Sana finding religion in secularity. Ultimately, the central question of all these storylines, like every teen show, is the same: How do I grow into my identity while dealing with the pressure to fit in?
As its characters answer this crucial question, "Skam" distinguishes itself through its radical authenticity. Andem created many of the plotlines from interviews with actual teenagers, who told her that shame (skam) — whether it was shame about their families, shame about religion, shame from an inability to fit in — was the guiding challenge of their experiences. At no point does Andem allow the series to divulge into sensationalization. She allows Sana to struggle with her religion without falling in love with a white man and ripping off her Hijab; when Isak comes out to his bro-y friends they make some expected dumb jokes, but they are never vicious. Andem allows her characters to experience challenges and trauma of teenagehood like racist and classist classmates, mental illness, and sexual assault, but always does so with compassion and empathy.
Andem even attempted to imitate the teenage experience with the show‘s production and release: Each week's episodes were published live in a series of clips at the hypothetical time they occurred and fake social media pages for the characters were made and regularly updated. The show was meant to be experienced in the same way teenagers experienced life: As a series of individual moments rather than a 30 minute spot at the end of the week.
During its run, "Skam" was never legally available outside of Norway. However, the series was covertly translated and downloaded by fans and spread internationally on suspicious Google Drive links posted on Tumblr stan accounts. Today there are millions of "Skam" fans across the globe, despite Norway only having a population of about five million, and "Skam" remakes have been produced across Europe and the US.
People watch TV for different reasons, but a popular one is to escape reality. "Skam" will not change your history, but it will allow you to look at your high school past through a rose-colored lens: one where the lonely girl finds her friends, the closeted boy finds love, and the victimized girl finds justice. "Skam'' has changed the lives of millions across the globe, and if you can get over the one inch tall barrier of subtitles, it can change yours too.
"Skam" is available on various unofficial sites, including with english subtitles at https://"Skam"englishsubs.tumblr.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Created 25 years ago by the Harvard Black Community and Student Theater group (BlackC.A.S.T), Eleganza has now become its own entirely independent organization. The annual performance is described on its website as the celebration of “the rich diversity of Harvard’s student body through cutting-edge fashion and dance.” Through YouTube, green screens, and a whole lot of editing, executive producers Leo A. Garcia '21, Nina S. Uzoigwe '21, and Phoebe H. Lindsay '21 overcame the challenge of maintaining this mission online.
Eleganza has always been one of Harvard’s most popular performances — tickets are sold to around “2,000 people every year.” For Uzoigwe, Eleganza cemented her decision to commit to Harvard.
“I think being able to see the kind of talent that everyone had, sort of see the diversity, see so many Black people on stage, [it] really helped me see what Harvard had to offer,” she said.
The biggest goal for the 2021 showcase, then, was to recreate the same energy of a huge crowd.
“Though it's not part of our official mission statement, we are really aware that Eleganza at its core is a community event that's really popular among students,” explained Lindsay. “And so we tried, as best as possible, to keep that spirit and keep that energy through the virtual production, and make it still that same exciting event.”
To address this challenge, the masterminds behind Eleganza increased their efforts to reach an audience of the same scale.
“[We stepped up] the publicity, the website, the ability to interact with media, and create[d] opportunities to view the show.”
Garcia also noted that the online format allowed viewers to create their own mini audiences.
“I watched it with my roommates and with another model, Phoebe watched it with her roommates, everyone brought together their family and their friends and whoever was around them. So doing that type of screening, as opposed to like having people log into Zoom, was something we were cognizant of.”
This approach worked well, as proven by the Eleganza website’s analytics: “We have like, 700 RSVPs, not counting how many people are watching from one screen at a time. It really showed us that the community that we were trying to create did translate from the screen into in-person,” said Garcia.
In fact, the online format allowed for an even wider reach than would be possible normally. “People from across the world could tune in… in India, in China and Australia, in South America, all over the world, people were tuning in, in a way that usually is impossible,” he added.
Any of these global audience members stunned by the looks served by model after model have Eleganza’s executive producers to thank. As Lindsay phrased it, the focus on fashion for this year’s production was designed to “bring the visions [of their scene directors] to light.” Garcia specifically described the connections they forged with their sponsors:
“This year our fashion chair, [Salena Prakah-Asante '23], was really wanting to highlight diverse artistry through fashion. And Nordstrom actually is working on this campaign, this new concept space called Black Space, where they're specifically highlighting Black designers. And so with Salena's vision, and with our show, there was a really a perfect match with Nordstrom.”
The third scene, titled The Black Effect, flaunted t-shirts from the brand Cross Colours LA, the designs of which were about Black Lives Matter, and Black Power.”
Beyond lending “basically any [clothing] that the producers asked for,” Eleganza’s sponsors seemed eager to support their principles.
“And what was really incredible about working with Nordstrom, Reiss, and a really wide range of brands is that it seemed like they were less interested about what their company personally had to gain from it. But rather, they were just interested in supporting students,” Garcia said.
Uzoigwe also added that the performers were able to film at the Nordstrom location in New York City, which was an incredible and unique opportunity for the students.
“I think being able to interact with the staff there really sort of emphasizes… [the company’s] dedication toward empowering Black artists, Black fashion and things of that nature.”
One core pillar of the usual show that was hindered by the performance’s online format is Eleganza’s commitment to charity.
“Ordinarily, we would be selling… 1,500 to 2,000 tickets, which would allow us to donate to a charity. So given that it was a free show this year, we sort of had to get creative with how we're going to do that.” Lindsay said.
The show’s executives decided to select five different organizations to donate to rather than choosing a single cause.
Garcia expanded on Lindsay’s explanation, saying “We realized that one organization did not cover nearly enough of what this year brought to light, both in terms of the pandemic and how that's impacting different people.” He mentioned several areas of activism, such as Black Lives Matter and combating the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans, as motivation for this change. Even without the revenue from ticket sales, Eleganza was able to raise $1,500 from donations alone.
Despite some difficulties, Garcia, Uzoigwe, and Lindsay ultimately acted as the glue that held this production together.
“Given the virtual format, [we had] to speak with fashion board, speak with the video editors, [have] that weekly meeting to make sure that everyone's on the same page and that everyone's vision is able to be brought to the table and mended together to create the final product that we see in our final show.” Uzoigwe said.
Viewers can find the Eleganza 2021 performance on YouTube and on its website, where you can still make a charitable donation. All proceeds go to organizations such as the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, the Official Navajo COVID-19 Relief Fund, the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, and more.
CORRECTION: April 30, 2021
A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Salena Prakah-Asante '23 and misstated the name of the brand of t-shirts used in the show's third scene. The brand is Cross Colours LA, not Comfort Colors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the Zoom screen, acclaimed writer Ocean Vuong donned a pair of tortoise shell glasses. In the background was a geometric array of potted plants hanging from his wall. He opened the virtual conversation with the ringing of a bell, a meditative gesture that prompted listeners to “call back” past versions of themselves. He read a poem titled “Not Even” from his forthcoming collection to the faceless audience of over one thousand participants. One particular line resonated powerfully:
“What if it wasn’t the crash that made me, but the debris?”
Though people often possess a deep aversion to the past, Vuong does not yield to this impulse. The enduring resonance of his texts emerges from his willingness to continually revisit the past as a space of reclamation and dialogue.
“In the Western mythos, we’re often told that we should forget the previous versions, the younger versions, of ourselves,” Vuong said. “But I actually think it’s important to honor that person, and to invite that person into the space of making, because often it was their great epicentric moment — that realization — that brought us here.”
Vuong, a Vietnamese-American writer and associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, probes the complexities of post-war identity, sexuality, history, and language in his writing. A recipient of a 2019 MacArthur “Genius” Grant and a Ruth Lilly Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation, he has established himself as a towering voice in contemporary literature. His literary corpus includes the poetry book “Night Sky with Exit Wounds,” winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize and the Whiting Award; and his debut novel “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” an instant New York Times bestseller that A24 is currently adapting into a film.
Initially scheduled to take place last year, the virtual conversation — hosted by the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study — was postponed due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. English Professor Ju Yon Kim, who moderated the conversation, said she felt they “were meant to gather here” in the present moment, referring to the Atlanta spa shootings that occurred on March 16. That evening, eight were shot and killed — six of whom were women of Asian descent.
Vuong is often described as a seminal voice in contemporary diasporic writing. For the poet and novelist, however, it is critical to interrogate what that term even means — the very concept is, according to Vuong, fraught with unwieldy expectations. He noted that when he first began writing, some writers of color around him saw diasporic writing as tired, or worse, a method of exoticizing one’s own cultural hardship to pander to the white gaze.
“There was a kind of smugness in transcending historical artifacts, a historical subject,” he recalled. “The smugness came out of this triumph of finally eliding white expectations of performing pain.”
According to Vuong, however, the perception of diasporic literature as performative and contrived puts writers of color in an impossible position. The response of many writers of color when faced with this reality is to excise diasporic or historical content from their writing entirely. For Vuong, this very form of “post-diasporic” writing is itself a form of subordination, a method of narrative policing fueled by a hyper-awareness of the white reader.
“I saw it with great grief, that at the end of the day, even though it was an oppositional position, it was still a position that was subordinate — or concerned with — the white gaze by negation,” he said.
Vuong suggested that the misguided perception of diasporic writing as an “exhausted” field is perpetuated by the unequal reception of particular types of literature.
“I think it could be because we’ve subliminally internalized that there could only be one of us, it could only be one of us writing about one thing,” he said. “And when someone executes it, they’ve claimed it,” he said. He emphasized that the way publishers approach the stories of writers of color often contributes to perpetuating this toxic dynamic.
The poet and novelist firmly rejects the belief that one writer of color can “claim” a particular strand of marginalized experience or feeling.
“There’s no way you could repeat anything else — and again, it’s a double standard. Often, whiteness gets to have an inexhaustible subject. But when it comes to us, when it comes to writers of color, our subjects are suddenly very exhaustible, quickly exhaustible,” he said.
Vuong conceded there will always be ghosts sitting on writers’ shoulders. He acknowledged this is particularly true for those approaching their work from experiences of marginalization and violence. According to Vuong, the antidote to the noise of these contending inner voices is to “privilege your sense of bewilderment and wonder.” He urged writers to engage questions — ones that are elusive and terrifying, yet also serve as a core impetus to write. When writing toward an answer to these questions, Vuong contends, outer voices gradually fall away.
“When you’re confronted with such a potent question, you quickly forget those voices, you quickly forget this idea of a white gaze, because it’s so small compared to what you’re heading towards,” Vuong said. “You’re heading toward this horizon that only you can answer, or only you can come close to. And so those things, they become so abstract and minute, because your questions are so much bigger than that.”
Vuong’s conversation served as the opening of a series of virtual programming at the Radcliffe Institute titled “Gender Rights in the Time of Pandemic.” Featuring multiple guest speakers, the session explored the process of organizing for gender rights across the world, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Chloé Zhao’s “Nomadland” was not the only big winner of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards, held on the weekend of April 10. Unlike in previous years, this ceremony marked one of the first times there weren’t widespread — and rightful — accusations of a lack of diversity among the ceremony's winners.
Winning four awards including Best Film, “Nomadland” emerged as the clear victor of the night. A drama based on a non-fiction book of the same name, the film tells the story of contemporary nomads traversing America in RVs in the wake of the 2008 recession. Its victory over two British productions was a testament to the film’s strength, as it prevailed in spite of BAFTA’s habit of favoring UK pictures — which would ultimately be borne out by its Oscar win.
Most notable are the film’s two female winners. The Best Director award for Chloé Zhao’s achievement marks the first time in BAFTAs history that an Asian woman won in the category, and only the second time that a female director did so since 2010, when Kathryn Bigelow earned the golden mask and the Oscar for “The Hurt Locker.”
Frances McDormand’s portrayal of the protagonist landed her the BAFTA for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Despite the fact there was little overlap between BAFTA and Oscar nominees in this category, the actress went on to repeat her success at the Academy Awards.
While the nominees at the two might have differed, overlap still seems to be the key word for the 74th BAFTAs. The British Academy managed to call the Oscar races for not just Best Picture and Best Director, but also the two screenplay and all four acting categories.
Anthony Hopkins and Youn Yuh-jung broke the records for the oldest winner in their respective categories and subverted expectations. Hopkins’s victory recognized his performance as the titular character in Florian Zeller's "The Father" (a film that also won Best Adapted Screenplay at both ceremonies), about an elderly parent who refuses any assistance from his daughter as he ages. As acclaimed as Hopkins' performance was, his win came as quite a shock, and anticipated the upset at the Oscars — the clear favorite, the late “Ma Rainey's Black Bottom” star Chadwick Boseman lost both, despite a history-making record for four Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations earlier this year.
Youn Yuh-jung winning Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her exquisite portrayal of her character in “Minari” — which also happens to be the first ever Korean-language performance to win a BAFTA — wasn’t much of an upset in and of itself. But her victory over the Oscar-nominated “Borat” actress Maria Bakalova, combined with the fact that “The Father”’s Olivia Coleman wasn’t even nominated (a rather telling snub as she is British), correctly pointed that the “deliciously chaotic” race for the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award might have been much less competitive than critics thought.
Unlike Youn Yuh-jung, Daniel Kaluuya’s award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Fred Hampton in “Judas and the Black Messiah” was hardly unexpected in light of his SAG. Just like in the case of the Korean actress, though, the subsequent Academy Award win reiterated that the accolade was more than justified.
The awards for the technical side of production were dominated by “Sound of Metal” and “Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.” The former, exploring the world of the deaf community, fittingly won the statue for sound, and another one for editing. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” might not have been up for consideration for its cinematography, but nevertheless it was recognized by the Academy for costume design as well as make-up and hair. The awards for these films produced by Amazon and Netflix respectively prove that the video streaming giants can compete with established movie studios, at least when it comes to their visuals.
Viewers looking for films differing from Hollywood productions should pay a closer look to the awards in which BAFTA honors the best British productions. In the Outstanding British Film category, the winner was “Promising Young Woman” (which also won both BAFTA and Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) but the nominees also included excellent horror films (a genre that the Academy doesn't usually touch), such as “Saint Maud” and “His House,” as well as the social dramas “Mogul Mowgli” and “Rocks.” The Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer award went to Remi Weekes, the screenwriter and director of "His House,” for whom the horror film served as a medium to illuminate the experiences of immigrants from South Sudan living in London. Bukky Bakray became the second woman of color to win the Rising Star Award after the 19-year-old’s phenomenal debut in “Rocks,” in which she portrays a girl struggling to take care of her younger brother after being abandoned by their single mother.
The long list of “firsts” and the more diverse ensemble of winners are a testament to BAFTA’s newfound commitment to diversity. The awards had long been lambasted for their lack of it, and incurred heavy criticism after last year’s all white acting nominations. Following the outcry, the BAFTA instituted over 120 changes after a seven month review process, which included diversifying its membership, requiring its members to watch all the nominated films, and restructuring its voting process to ensure that less mainstream productions have a fair chance of being recognized.
The BAFTAs didn’t disappoint this year, proving an exciting bellwether for the Academy Awards, and correctly calling some of the most competitive races. There’s no denying that the 74th ceremony differed from previous years — the changes were not just the result of a pandemic, but of long-awaited greater recognition of minority and independent artists.

“A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.” Just as Gandalf tells Frodo upon their first on-screen meeting, the world was blessed with the release of “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” at the end of 2001, right when Peter Jackson intended. With a budget of $281 million and 438 days spent on principal photography, the entirety of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy set a precedent as one of the most all-encompassing and impressive film endeavors ever taken. The tale of the One Ring and the Fellowship’s goal of destroying it created one of the greatest and most dedicated cult followings. Truly, “The Fellowship of the Ring” changed the world of cinematography and storytelling and has continued to have an impact for the last twenty years.
One of the greatest aspects of the first film of the trilogy is its phenomenal scoring done by Howard Shore. The scoring earned the film the Academy Award for Best Original Score, one of 17 Oscars earned for the trilogy. With swooning melodies and impressive orchestral pieces, the soundtrack for the “Fellowship of the Ring” only elevates the experience of watching the group of dwarves, men, hobbits, an elf, and a wizard travel through the wonders of Middle Earth. In so many moments, this incredible compilation of compelling music is able to capture the essence of J.R.R. Tolkein’s masterfully written work. In creating one of the most in-depth and carefully curated fantasy worlds of all time, Tolkein already set a lofty bar for anyone to attempt to replicate it — but Shore’s score successfully immerses viewers into the magic of Middle Earth even further.
With the film’s individual budget of almost $100 million, it’s no question that the film had what it needed to become a flourishing foundation for the trilogy. At the time of filming around the turn of the century, the film was a landmark for such a bold budget. With films like “Titanic” making waves with a $200 million budget, “The Fellowship of the Ring” stood apart as a fantasy film. In a lot of ways, the producers took quite the gamble in making the adaptation of Tolkein’s fantasy epic — and clearly, it paid off. Combining breathtaking on-location shoots in New Zealand, state-of-the-art practical effects, and a cast with the talent necessary to make it all happen, “The Fellowship of the Ring” changed the world’s expectations for any high quality fantasy film.
However, the film does still deviate from its source material. In a perfectly understandable approach, director Peter Jackson delivered his own take on the incredibly dense literary trilogy. In the entirety of the trilogy, Tolkein wrote over 1000 pages. There was almost no way that Jackson would be able to reasonably reproduce the detail of the books, but in his own way he successfully put his own spin on the material while cutting it down to a comfortable viewing length. From the pure complexity of the characters’ relationships to the intricate descriptions of each flora and fauna, Jackson wisely opted to relegate the richness of Tolkien’s details to subtle background nods. By instead focusing on Tolkien’s central characters, not the intricateness of his worldbuilding, Jackson successfully turned these archetypal heroes into fleshed out, fully realized people.
Even after 20 years, “The Fellowship of the Ring” remains the embodiment of the ideal fantasy epic. The story spans an array of beautiful and wild landscapes in far-off worlds, follows incredibly well-defined characters, and brings to life a land beyond imagination. With its incredible score, phenomenal cinematography, and astounding directing, “The Lord of the Rings” will undoubtedly continue to be one of the most beloved franchises of the current generation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear younger self,
I remember you as clear as day. You had short twists, wearing your school uniform, and you would be playing soccer or sitting in the library during recess. You would wear your hair down, but Dad said to pack it up so people could see your face, but your head was always in some book, so it didn’t really matter anyway. I remember the feeling of childhood like it was yesterday, and yet it’s so far away. The feeling after leaving a movie theater, going on rides at the theme park, going on school field trips and getting lunchables. I cherish the small pockets of blissfulness in those moments so much, and I wish I could transport myself back to that simplicity.
But as you got older, you realized it was never simple. I am writing you this letter because I am at a turning point in my life, where it feels like those blissful moments are slipping away from me, and I need to look back to you for advice. The countless stories and news reports I continue to see, hear, and feel have brought a heaviness to my heart. You always saw these things despite being quieter than me. You witnessed things that I am only now discovering and learning how to navigate. But we also aren’t as different as I expected.
I’m having trouble distinguishing girlhood from adulthood. I thought it would be clear: Getting your driver's license, turning 18, attending college, getting a job, but none of these have been markers of my adulthood. None provided the answers that I remember you were pondering in those classrooms, in the library, and even on the field. None could explain those moments you had that confused you.
I remember when you first heard about Trayvon Martin. You were 13, but you couldn’t process the entirety of what was happening. You would see Mom and Dad watching the news when you would go to ask a question about your homework. You saw protests, and you saw Trayvon Martin’s face, but only small things stuck with you. His eyes when news reporters showed his face. I still remember it today, but I never reflected on what that moment meant to you, to me, only 13 years old. Only 13 years old. There is a blurred line between childhood and adulthood for Black children when we see events like this in the media and for some, in real life. What is your childhood when by age 13 your curiosity and blissfulness are taken from you?
Yet so many beautiful Black children were forced to encounter that type of senseless death and those fears all while going to class and seeing their classmates. You must strive to see beauty in your Blackness and your girlhood: your hair, your skin, your style, your passion, no matter the negativity others may want to paint your Black girlhood. Begin to learn how to embrace all aspects of yourself, and turn to the other Black girls and women in your life to guide you.
We as a society have normalized kids growing up having a “racist phase,” before realizing their wrongs. No Black girl is obligated to endure another child’s “racist phase.” No Black girl should be turned into a teacher in matters of race. We owe it to ourselves to grow beyond these roles. You are first obligated to yourself and to grow for yourself. No longer will Black girls be seen as stepping stones for others to cross the bridge from anti-Black to ally. Many experiences and events may threaten your childhood, but we still know how to preserve and create memories for us to cherish.
I remember your imaginary friend Violet that you made in first grade to read with you, and you drew her on a bookmark I still have; I remember when you met one of your first childhood friends because of your matching Wizards of Waverly Place shoes; I remember you painting the windows for the Halloween Window Painting Contest every year with your friends in middle school. Our childhoods are complex but seldom do Black girls get to celebrate and appreciate the times when we get to be ourselves.
You created bonds of meaningful friendship with others, and together we brought joy to ourselves and forged new paths together. Soon, you will learn of so many other Black women who have materialized these paths for you and created doors for other Black girls to achieve their dreams.
Adulthood and adulting as a Black woman feel like something entirely different … Wow, do I even see myself as a Black woman just yet?
Black girlhood to Black womanhood was never a set milestone, but it was when you began to see your world differently. It was when you became completely cognizant of your navigation of your world as a Black girl but embraced it. Those thoughts that sat silently in your mind, you slowly began to share with me. Then you shared it with your classmates, and soon enough you were attending conferences and began to express yourself in your writing. You wrote the world and created new ones that imagined different trajectories and, through your writing, you formed the bridge I am now crossing to become the Black woman I see myself as today.
I can’t guide you through adulthood since I am still figuring it all out. I still have to learn the basics: taxes, smog checks, groceries. I can only say, the first step to becoming a Black woman, is to nurture yourself and love yourself and all aspects of your Black womanhood in whichever form it takes. The strongest river, the longest path you could ever forge is with yourself, and I will continue to do so for our future self.
So, thank you for giving me the courage, the confidence, and the patience to cherish these moments that I have with you, with me. Until next time.
With love,
Ogechukwu Ogbogu

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since as far back as 1899, final clubs have been recognized as a major problem on Harvard’s campus. In a speech that year, Henry Lee Higginson, Class of 1855, chastised the final clubs for “their small membership and high expenses” and “habits of exclusiveness and luxury which hurt our democratic university." In an effort to counter the power of these clubs, Higginson donated $150,000 to build the “Harvard Union” for all those not in final clubs.
Despite Higginson’s noble gesture, 122 years later, final clubs are still hurting the democratic spirit of our university.
Last June, a Supreme Court ruling made Harvard’s sanctions against members of final clubs and single-gender Greek organizations potentially unconstitutional, leading the University to revoke its five-year-old policy. As a result, Harvard’s crusade against clubs that segregate and exclude members on the basis of gender — and all too often social class and race — came to an end.
Harvard needs to realize that if it can’t beat the final clubs, it needs to compete with them. Harvard fights for its right to put together a diverse class. And now, to quote the Beastie Boys, Harvard needs to fight for its students’ right to party, democratically.
Parties are not trivial matters. They are the social life of the student body and determine whether Harvard’s social fabric tends towards integration and inclusion or separation and exclusion. The fact that the majority of students are excluded from the spaces where the majority of the fun is often perceived to happen is demoralizing and undemocratic.
Harvard’s social history consists of two big historical forces. One, a powerful proactive vision of increasing inclusion and the other, a bastion of privilege and exclusion. The good news is that the first force has been winning.
First, Harvard built the House system to prevent segregation by wealth. Before it, poor students lived in the Yard and rich students lived on the “Gold Coast” of Mount Auburn Street. Next, Harvard randomized housing so students couldn’t electively segregate by preppies, jocks, and artists — each in their own respective Houses. All the while, Harvard diversified its class. Today, Harvard students are majority people of color and over 15 percent of Harvard undergraduates are first-generation college students.
To its credit, Harvard makes extraordinary investments to defend democratic interactions on its campus. Currently, Harvard is investing $1.4 billion to renovate its inclusive residential houses and is legally defending its right to build a diverse class — which, if necessary, they will argue vociferously before the Supreme Court.
Starting now, Harvard needs to apply the same tools it used to promote a democratic vision in admissions and residential housing to its social life.
Currently, rather than being intimate, warm, and inviting, much of Harvard’s social event spaces are gigantic, impersonal, and surveilled. Final clubs, on the other hand, succeed because they have the exact opposite characteristics.
Fortunately, unlike the residential House system, competing with the final clubs doesn’t require immense resources. Harvard should have a policy that for every final club there will be a Community Club. A Community Club would be a small building, essentially a house, run by student groups committed to promoting inclusive social life. Students groups could then compete for two-year leases by proposing their vision of the Community Club and the inclusive events they would host before the Undergraduate Council, which can provide them with an annual budget.
Unlike the final clubs, all students would be welcome with no invitation list. And as these are privately-leased buildings, Harvard would not surveil these parties and would not police the responsible use of alcohol. Rather, the student groups would be selected carefully to ensure they have the best interest of their fellow students at heart. And in any event, student groups leading Community Clubs would lose their charter in two years or possibly earlier if unacceptable behavior is reported.
Peer institutions such as Williams, Amherst, and Bowdoin have all successfully established similar models, buying former fraternity houses and transforming them into college-owned, inclusive party spaces. And in fact, the Advocate and the Dudley Co-op, both of whose buildings are owned by Harvard, largely operate by this model already. These other schools show that potentially increased liability with regards to the consumption of alcohol should not be a barrier to inclusive and democratic social life at Harvard.
In addition to establishing a set of Community Clubs, there are other ways Harvard can positively transform social life on campus. For example, it can ensure that every residential House has large social venues much like the Pforzheimer House “Igloo” and the Cabot House “Aquarium.” And as The Crimson Editorial Board has suggested, Harvard should complete its residential house renovations with more suites with common rooms and reduce the number of hotel-like hallway singles and doubles which undermine a sense of community and an ability to gather — and yes, to throw parties.
Harvard’s proposed solution is for final clubs to have “no public parties.” This is the wrong solution. As Justice Louis D. Brandeis has famously said about speech, the remedy “to falsehoods and fallacies … is more speech, not enforced silence.” Similarly, the answer to discriminatory exclusive parties is not no parties, but more inclusive parties. Simply put, it’s time for Harvard to take parties seriously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EDITOR'S NOTE: The Crimson Editorial Board aims to provide a platform for a wide range of perspectives, publishing pieces that critically engage with various aspects of campus life. As such, we have chosen to publish the piece below, which critiques The Crimson’s own reporting and leadership practices. Just as we believe in the ability of opinion writing to improve our university, we value opinion writing that is critical of our newspaper and welcome dialogue about our ongoing efforts to improve as an organization.
— Hana M. Kiros ’22, Editorial Chair
— Chloe A. Shawah ’22, Editorial Chair
— Amanda Y. Su ’22, President
On September 13, 2019, The Harvard Crimson’s News Board published ten articles. Most were standard: one covered the Harvard Votes Challenge, another the renovation of a Harvard Divinity School building — but one, in particular, was most memorable. It was a piece covering an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest hosted by Act on a Dream, a student organization that advocates for fairer and reformed United States immigration policies. The article began like any other — reporting Crimson-style on the who, what, when, where, and why. However, there existed one line in this seemingly ordinary article that would come to spark controversy at 14 Plympton Street (The Crimson’s home) edged inconspicuously in the middle of the article. It read: “ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.”
This 12-word, stand-alone sentence exposed a well-hidden flaw within The Crimson: As a newspaper, we value objectivity more than community.
A month after the controversial article, The Crimson’s leadership at the time released a joint statement maintaining that the newspaper abided by standard journalistic practices. When a party is publicly criticized, The Crimson is obligated to contact them for their side of the story — that’s the “best way to ensure the integrity, fairness, and accuracy of our reporting.” However, this frigid statement gave little consideration towards the protection of our undocumented peers, as well as those close to them, who were experiencing a justified fear of ICE’s dangerous and oppresive power.
The Crimson has sworn by this defense — our unwavering allegiance to “standard journalistic practices” — in order to absolve ourselves of blame for far too long. We can no longer burrow our heads beneath this excuse when our standard practices have hurt the people whom we call our peers, with whom we share a community.
And although we are almost two years removed from this incident, and The Crimson is no longer being boycotted by Act on a Dream, we cannot treat this as an isolated event — mostly, because it isn’t.
In April of 2018, an intoxicated, unarmed Black undergraduate student was arrested after being beaten by Cambridge Police right outside of campus. As usual, The Crimson was quick to report on this incident, but haphazardly included Twitter links that exposed the student’s identity. While The Crimson later removed these links “out of concern for the privacy of the student involved”, the damage had been done, and we again jeopardized the safety of our peers in the name of standard journalism.
I have loved my time at The Crimson, and I do hold the opinion that we are improving at sensitive reporting — but at a snail’s pace. There are people who still will not interact with The Crimson due to our past reporting. We, as a newspaper, have much work to be done in mending the wounds we have inflicted upon vulnerable groups at Harvard.
To the members of Act on a Dream, and all other Harvard affiliates hurt by The Crimson’s insensitive reporting — you deserve an apology. Full stop. And I know that I cannot speak on behalf of this entire organization, but I am truly sorry that The Crimson has so severely eroded the trust that is foundational to a healthy relationship between students and their school newspaper — because that’s what we are. A school newspaper.
No matter how many donors back us or irrelevant advertisements sandwich themselves between our words — at the end of the day, we are a school newspaper composed of undergraduates. Irrespective of our potential futures in journalism (which I worry about), we are students today. And the community we report on, the people we interview and photograph, they are our peers — we owe them ethical reporting of their stories with grace and decency.
To hide behind the excuse of following standard journalistic practices is cowardly. Many “practices” across disciplines that were seen as standard not so long ago are abhorred today. This is not to suggest that Crimson News should end its impartial reporting — of course not, because that’s why we have an Editorial Board and a clear wall that separates them. But The Crimson does not have to be the apprentice of major news publications — we can be different and we can be better. We have the power to be more ethical, more sensible, more understanding. We can protect our own community because I like to think that we care about each other and that our classmates are not just footholds we may step on towards our future careers.
We don’t have to swear by the Washington Post or the New York Times — and we don’t have to ever, ever contact ICE.
And to the Crimson editors reading this who advocate tirelessly for change within your boards and beyond, thank you. I know it’s hard to push and be halted at every turn. I know change comes too slow and frustrations pile up too fast. But I see you, and I appreciate you.
However, the question becomes, how can we bring about change at 14 Plympton Street? For starters, I know some editors believe that elections for executive status should be democratic. At present, the process of becoming an executive — or the “Turkey Shoot” as we call it — is a reductive turnover of power. It generally ends up being the current executives who vote to decide who the incoming ones will be. This conservative practice is the reason why it is so difficult to enact policy change within The Crimson. All editors, regardless of executive status, should have a vote in choosing who represents them. This is the only way our voices can make a real impact.
So, my fellow Crimson editors, what now? How do we move forward and become better? The answer is not yet clear, but I am definitely sure of one thing: to hell with “keep the old sheet flying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A driver struck a pedestrian on Memorial Drive near Dunster House around 9 p.m. Monday, resulting in serious injuries to the pedestrian.
The victim — a 28-year-old woman from California who lives with family in the Boston area — was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where she remained in critical condition as of Wednesday.
The driver, a 29-year-old woman who lives in Brookline, was not injured in the collision, per an emailed statement from David A. Procopio, a spokesperson for Massachusetts State Police.
The facts of the crash remain under investigation by Massachusetts State Police, with assistance from its Collision Analysis Reconstruction Section and Crime Scene Services Section.
“Preliminary investigation suggests the vehicle was eastbound on Memorial Drive in the area of the intersection with DeWolfe Street when the pedestrian entered the roadway in the area of the Weeks Footbridge and was struck,” Procopio wrote. “The driver remained on scene.”
Procopio declined to reveal the names of the parties involved, but confirmed neither are Harvard students.
Cambridge City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler weighed in on the crash on Twitter, arguing that the incident demonstrates why the roadway needs increased safety for non-drivers.
“The details are being investigated, but it's clear Mem Drive needs improvements from [the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation] to prioritize people over cars,” he wrote.
Sobrinho-Wheeler also pointed to calls from Green Cambridge’s Memorial Drive Alliance, a coalition that includes stakeholders from city councilors to Harvard student organizations.
“A coalition of groups are calling for fewer cars and more pedestrian space, green space, and bike improvements on Memorial Drive,” he wrote. “DCR is planning for a redesign on Memorial Drive, and I hope they listen and look forward to being part of the process.”
The Memorial Drive Alliance’s demands include replacing two lanes on the road with a bi-directional bike path and planting trees along Memorial Drive to provide pedestrians and bicyclists with shade.
“We have a shared goal of making the Memorial Drive Parkway a beautiful, safe, resilient, and vibrant green corridor for the enjoyment of many generations to come,” the group’s website reads.
A DCR spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that a multi-year project to improve the roadway is underway, and now in its third phase. The organization plans to remove two of the lanes for cars and replace them with a bicycle lane and landscaping.
The DCR is taking Green Cambridge and the Memorial Drive Alliance’s concerns into consideration, among dozens of local stakeholders, the spokesperson added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor of Economics Isaiah S. Andrews won the John Bates Clark Medal earlier this month for his contributions to the field of econometrics.
The Clark Medal is awarded annually by the American Economic Association to an economist under the age of 40 “who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge,” per its website.
Andrews — who joined Harvard’s faculty in 2018 — also received MacArthur “Genius Grant” in 2020. He is just 34 years old.
Jeremy C. Stein, the chair of the Economics Department, described Andrews as a “phenomenally talented person.”
“It's all the more extraordinary that he got this award because it's for the best economist under 40,” Stein said. “Usually people win it when they're close to 40.”
Andrews said he was stunned when he learned he was receiving the prestigious award.
“I was pretty stunned,” he said. “I was very much not expecting it so it was a huge surprise — obviously a very pleasant surprise, but a huge surprise.”
But Ashesh Rambachan, a Ph.D. candidate advised by Andrews, said he was not surprised to learn of his advisor’s achievement.
“I think my reaction was, ‘Wow, that's awesome, and totally unsurprising. Yeah, this makes perfect sense,’” Rambachan said, calling Andrews’ work “brilliant.”
The awards committee outlined three major aspects of his work that have made a significant contribution to the field of econometrics. He was acknowledged for developing statistical tools that allow economists and policymakers to estimate the effect of changing parameters on a model’s output; demonstrating the significance of publication bias on a study’s findings; and making inferences “in the presence of weak identification.”
“I work on developing new statistical methods or setting the properties of existing statistical methods, motivated by applications of economics,” Andrews said. “Essentially, trying to think about these statistical tools which economists are using to answer the empirical questions that we care about, and trying to think about how to make those tools better, or how to understand where those tools are falling short and what we can do about it.”
Stein said that Andrews' work focuses on “real world applications,” and is very collaborative.
“One of the ideas I think behind the prize is that he's somebody who not only works on this stuff, but he's really very willing to collaborate with people who are not just pure econometricians.” Stein said. “He's really interested in kind of improving the use of data in policy applications.”
Both Stein and Rambachan emphasized that Andrews’ contributions to academia extend beyond his research.
“He's only been in the department a few years but he's already one of the best mentors, advisors, colleagues.” Stein said. “Just a phenomenal colleague in every way.”
“He's just a really really a great role model for what it means not only to be a good researcher, but to be sort of a good member of the academic community and that's something really important about who he is,” Rambachan said.

Panelists discussed the legal, ethical, and public health implications of coronavirus digital health passes — or “vaccine passports” — at a Wednesday afternoon webinar hosted by the Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.
Petrie-Flom Center Executive Director Carmel D. Shachar moderated the event, titled “Vaccine Passports: A Path to the New Normal?” for an audience of more than 130 people.
The panelists included I. Glenn Cohen, the faculty director of the Petrie-Flom Center; Natalie M. Kofler, a visiting fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics; Iris Goldner Lang, a professor at the University of Zagreb; and Seema Mohapatra, a law professor at Indiana University.
Though vaccine passports may offer a return to normalcy and allow institutions like universities to reopen, some panelists said they may also create privacy concerns and exacerbate existing inequities.
“The equity issues are both domestic in terms of racialized minorities and rural populations and people with disabilities, but also international in terms of access to vaccines for low and middle income countries,” Cohen said.
Having to provide proof of vaccination against other diseases is “commonplace,” Cohen said, giving the example of the yellow fever card that international travelers use to prove they have been vaccinated against yellow fever.
There are fundamental differences, however, between a Covid-19 vaccine passport and the yellow fever card because of the variance in Covid-19 vaccine efficacy and the lack of information about transmission or length of immunity, according to Kofler.
“This is a global pandemic and the issue here is really about protecting communities,” Kofler said. “We need to make sure that if we're allowing vaccinated individuals to travel to places that have low vaccination rates, are they actually protecting those communities from transmission?”
There may also be privacy concerns associated with developing vaccine passport infrastructure in the U.S., Mohapatra said. Under current proposals, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA — a federal law which protects a patient’s sensitive and private health information — would not apply to vaccine passports.
The European Commission recently proposed its own vaccine passport: the Digital Green Certificate, which would provide information about a person’s Covid-19 vaccination status, if they have recovered from the disease, and whether they have tested negative. According to Lang, there are “huge concerns” about the new program because of the emphasis on data protection and privacy in the E.U.
The panelists agreed that the issue of vaccination passports has become politicized in the U.S., which Mohapatra said was “unfortunate.”
“Some of the reasons why they become political hot rods are not related to either the practical, ethical, or legal issues,” she said. “They're based on no government intervention, distrust of any kind of government intervention in your lives.”
Still, as proposals for vaccine passports become a reality, Cohen said he hopes the federal government can implement one “single, unified, super cybersecure” mechanism, rather than leaving it in the hands of state governments or private companies.
“It would be great if the federal government took on this aspect of building the highway, even if they don't want to enforce the rules of the road,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics, in partnership with Harvard College, hosted a “Day of Civic Action” Thursday, with the goal of encouraging civic participation among students.
The day included live advocacy events such as phone banking, as well as a discussion on running for office with former U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III.
The day aimed to build on the rise of involvement in the 2020 election and to boost civic participation at Harvard, according to IOP Vice President Kevin L. Ballen ’22.
“We saw all this momentum in the 2020 election, and we saw so many student organizations join us and so many students get involved,” he said. “We wanted a way to continue that enthusiasm and to channel it.”
He added that he hoped the day would inspire students to take civic action outside of voting.
Alexander K. Park ’23, co-chair of the Harvard Votes Challenge, said he hopes that the day will strengthen a culture of civic engagement at Harvard.
“Having a day of civic action, where students are being intentional about taking action to benefit the community, to benefit causes that they care about, to be mindful about their place in their community and how they can help serve their community, I think will be a wonderful step in the right direction to achieve this overall goal of a culture of civic engagement and cultural public service at Harvard University,” he said.
The Harvard Votes Challenge hosted three events during the day, including a nonpartisan voter turnout text bank, an electoral reform event, and a phone bank and discussion centered around Asian Americans and Pacific Islander advocacy.
Liam M. F. Hall ’23 — who attended the event with Kennedy on running for office — said he felt the Day of Civic Action was well planned.
“I think that they were very well organized in the programming that they offered,” he said. “I think that it was done well.”
Aaron Abai ’22 — founder of the STEM and Social Engagement Coalition, a new organization that aims to promote engagement with social issues among students in STEM — said the coalition is working with the IOP to promote civic participation.
The coalition hosted an event on Thursday which advocated for the STEM Opportunities Act, a bill in Congress that would create grants for groups historically underrepresented in STEM at institutions of higher education, as well as other bills helping to support researchers who have been hurt by the pandemic. During the event, participants called their representatives, wrote letters, and spoke about how to get students more energized about social and political advocacy.
Abai said his goal for the day was to help raise awareness that science is political.
“I think there's this narrative that science is objective, and that people who are in STEM should not be involved in social and civic issues,” he said. “My goal is to get STEM students energized about how we can leverage our identity, being in STEM, how we can use that to advance social and political issues, both those that are directly relevant to us as scientists, but also those that know we can be allies towards.”

The Harvard College acceptance rate fell to 3.43 percent this year, with just 1,968 out of the 57,435 applicants to the Class of 2025 receiving an acceptance letter.
For some in the college admissions field, this was an indicator of Harvard’s excellence and high quality academics; for others, it was a sign of the University’s elitism and unwillingness to extend its resources to educate more students.
David L. Kirp — a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who recently wrote an op-ed titled “Why Stanford Should Clone Itself” — said the selectivity of elite institutions embodies the opposite of “what higher education is supposed to be about.”
“It is supposed to be providing the best education to the largest number of students and making sure that they learn a lot and get degrees,” he said.
Harvard’s acceptance rate has gradually decreased throughout its history. In 1997, the acceptance rate for the Class of 2001 was 12.3 percent. Just a decade later, in 2007, the acceptance rate for the Class of 2011 had fallen to 9 percent. A decade after that, in 2017, the acceptance rate for the Class of 2021 had shrunk to 5.2 percent.
This year’s admissions rate of 3.43 percent — the lowest in the College’s history — has raised questions among professors and educational consultants about the quality and accessibility of an education at Harvard and other increasingly selective institutions.
While Harvard and some experts argue that the declining admissions rate is driven by an uptick in applications, others said they believe other factors, such as legacy and athlete admissions, or a deliberate attempt to inflate the rate, may also be a factor.
Christine Chu, a former assistant director of admissions at Yale and Georgetown and current college counselor at IvyWise, attributed the record-low acceptance rates at Harvard and its peer institutions to the magnitude of applications they received.
“It was a little surprising to see the increase in the number of applications at some of the top schools, and also just the magnitude of that increase,” Chu said. “But it’s just the mathematics that drives down the acceptance rate.”
Another factor specific to this year’s admissions cycle that might have driven down the acceptance rate was the test-optional policy that numerous colleges, including Harvard, implemented due to the pandemic. The policy lowered the barriers to applying and likely boosted application rates as a result, per educational consultant Whitney Laughlin.
“There is a correlation between that and having test scores not be required,” said Laughlin, who ran a non-profit to help Native American students apply to college and graduate school. “I think that’s why Harvard got so many applicants this year, was that there were kids who were amazing kids, but maybe they didn’t have the best test scores, and they decided to give it a go.”
Jeffrey J. Selingo, a professor at Arizona State University who has authored multiple books about higher education, also said selective colleges intensely market themselves to encourage students to apply, which in turn inflates the rate at which they reject students.
“What’s wrong with rejecting 90 percent of students or 85 percent of students? Does that mean you’re of a lesser quality when you do that?” Selingo said. “And then if you don’t want to do that, then stop encouraging so many applications — all of these colleges do still do a ton of marketing to students around the world encouraging applications.”
“You’re now rejecting 96, 97 percent of students,” he added. “I don’t think that’s something that you should be proud of.”
However, Steven R. Goodman — an educational consultant and former admissions officer at the University of Pennsylvania — said Harvard’s recruitment efforts are vital to ensuring a diverse student body.
He said he believes Harvard’s Admissions Office and its director, William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, have done a “really good job” in recruiting students from different backgrounds who might not otherwise have applied.
“In fairness, Harvard broadly recruits way beyond what they need to,” Goodman said. “When you look at the efforts that Bill Fitzsimmons has been doing over the years, to go to every corner that his team could possibly go to … they’ve done a really good job of that, in fact, in some ways better than any other school.”
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment for this story.
Experts and observers also differ on what a highly selective admissions rate implies about a school — including its standing and its mission.
In a recent survey by The Crimson, over 40 percent of respondents in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences said they believe the University’s standing in higher education has fallen in recent years.
“To some people, it’s the gold standard,” Goodman said of a low acceptance rate. “To other people, it means absolutely nothing.”
Goodman said he believes elite universities are “not at fault for staying elite.”
“If in the marketplace, the eliteness is a proxy for quality, then it is certainly in the university’s interest to do that,” he said. “The ethical question is whether or not that makes sense for other people besides the university.”
For Laughlin, increasing the number of students accepted at elite universities is less important than ensuring their admissions processes are equitable and produce a diverse class.
“You have some very small liberal arts colleges, that it would change their mission to get bigger,” she said. “But they have been able to become more and more diverse over the days. Amherst is a perfect example of that.”
The duty of elite institutions is not to educate “more students,” but to educate “more underrepresented students,” Laughlin said.
Despite setting the record for its lowest acceptance rate, Harvard’s Class of 2025 is one of the most diverse classes in its history.
Still, Kirp argued that economic disparity exists within each class of students. He cited a 2017 study which found that, “at five of the Ivies, there are more students who come from the top 1 percent of the income curve, than come from the bottom 60 percent.”
Laughlin emphasized the importance of “non-quantitative indicators of success” in admissions processes. She said that in discussing how to make admissions more equitable, she was once asked, “‘Are we lowering the bar?’”
“I took a deep breath, because I’ve heard that so many times. And I said to him, ‘Well, first of all, whose bar is it?’” she said. “And second of all, how do you know that bar proves anything?”
Several higher education experts, including Selingo and Kirp, have argued universities should take steps to increase the number of students they are admitting.
To facilitate that, Kirp argued that elite universities — especially those with large endowments — should build new campuses in other locations.
“If Yale can open a campus in Singapore, why not in St. Louis?” he said. “Those cities would just die to have a Harvard on the grounds.”
Kirp added that this would open up many new jobs for faculty, as well.
“There are lots of faculty members out there in the universe who think they belong at Harvard, and not wherever they’re teaching now,” he said.
Selingo said he believes increasing the number of admitted students by 10 or 20 percent will balance the pressures to admit legacies and recruited athletes, citing recent decisions by Yale and Rice University to increase their enrollment as examples.
“Too often now we see admissions as a zero-sum game, when one person gets in, one person is denied,” Selingo said. “It becomes less of that game, although it’s still going to exist, if you increase the number of seats in the freshman class.”
Selingo also said the pandemic has offered new insights into remote teaching methods, which could facilitate a hybrid model with some students learning off-campus.
“We could actually serve more students, perhaps within even the current infrastructure by having more hybrid courses or offering some online courses to students, offering some time off campus to be pursuing work or internships or undergraduate research,” he said.
Though he acknowledged the cost of these kinds of measures, Selingo said colleges like Harvard are capable of taking such steps, given their wealth.
“These are institutions that are incredibly wealthy, you know, 40-plus billion dollar endowments, or billions and tens of billions in other cases. So it’s clear that they can do more,” Selingo said. “We’re not asking them to do a lot more.”
Despite plentiful suggestions for admissions reform, Selingo said he does not believe that Harvard or its peer institutions will actually implement any of them.
“After doing this for twenty plus years, I’m very skeptical that any president of Harvard or Yale or Princeton wants to take this on,” Selingo said. “And I think the longer they delay this, the longer they kick this question down the road, I think that it’s only going to come back to haunt them, in terms of lawsuits, in terms of government regulation.”
Goodman said he believes Harvard should accept more students, but regardless, believes the debate on who deserves to attend Harvard and other highly selective institutions should continue.
“It’s a variation of the old golden rule, you know, ‘Who holds the gold, rules.’ And since Harvard holds the gold — meaning the billions of dollars in endowment — Harvard gets to define that,” Goodman said. “But should it be an open-ended question for society to debate? Yes.”

Even before the pandemic began, being an international student has always been challenging. America is already weird to Americans. Imagine what it feels like for international students to suddenly have to worry about sales tax, Fahrenheit, as well as the Boston accent *shudder*. Thankfully, for the 12.2 percent of students admitted to Harvard every year who are from abroad, the First-Year International Program is here to help. Flyby chatted with Yousuf A. Bakshi ’23, FIP’s pre-orientation co-director, about all his best FIP mems & advice.
ATQH: Can you tell us a little bit about the history of FIP?
YAB: FIP has existed for many, many, many years now. It’s been one of the most pivotal pre-orientation programs at Harvard. It helps acclimate all these international students to a brand new country and a brand new campus, basically. It’s one of the OG, one of the big dogs. We have a very large cohort every year of around 150 international students who are so eager and excited to join not only campus, but to join a new international community on campus.
They’ll be joined by 45 student leaders who are so excited, motivated, and determined to make those students’ journey to Harvard an amazing success. Not only do we help with setting up a cell phone or bank account, but we also do really fun events where we introduce them to American culture. So we teach them how to do different American dances or we teach them how to acclimate to America, while also learning more about Harvard’s culture and learning how to be their best selves at Harvard. Many of the academic programs at Harvard are very different from what they are used to back home, so we will help with the transition to a new education curriculum, a new working environment, a new way of life on campus. That’s why it’s an amazing program, because FIP will really help you with your transition to Harvard and your transition to a new country.
ATQH: How and why did you get involved in FIP originally as a pre-frosh? Is there an application process for students who want to choose FIP as their pre-orientation experience?
YAB: So, when I first got accepted to Harvard, the first thing I did was look at the FIP website. I was very excited but also was very nervous about moving to a new country, so I wanted to see if there’s anything available for international students before I made the commitment to move to Harvard and moved to a new country. FIP was the first resource that I saw. I was probably a bit too eager. Like the day after the acceptance, I looked at the FIP website and went through all of the FIP leaders’ bios, read all about FIP. I even sent an email to FIP leaders asking “How do I apply to FIP?” and they told me that registration would open in May, so around six months after I got in.
And it would be the same thing this year for FIP registration. FIP is actually not an application and just a registration. So every international student or a student who is from the US but lives overseas will receive an email, and that email will tell them that they have been invited to FIP and registration will open in the summer. And in August, you will be put into your families and FIP will begin! It’s a very, very fun experience, and it all begins in the summer when registration opens.
ATQH: Whoa, you don’t need to apply for FIP? That is so nice. 
YAB: Yeah, we believe that international students should take FIP and I mean, we don’t want to put any barriers in their way. So we just want to know exactly who they are when they register and then if they’re international students then yeah, they’re gonna get FIP. FIP is for every international-experienced student, so we encourage them all to come.
ATQH: How long is FIP?
YAB: We don’t exactly know how it would be this year as we’re still planning it, but typically FIP has always been four days — but last year, it turned into two weeks! We’re definitely going to have a longer program, we’re not gonna have four days anymore, because we feel like it’s not enough honestly to acclimate to Harvard in four days. So we’re going to try to get a longer FIP period because we found it to be much more fun, encouraging, exciting, motivating to have a longer experience. We haven’t planned exactly for this year just quite yet, but expect it to be as great as ever.
Actually, last year before Covid struck, FIP was actually given the go-ahead to be longer! So we were going to have a week of FIP in the dorms, and that was gonna be the longest FIP we’ve ever done on campus as well. So that was gonna be really exciting. But unfortunately Covid struck, and it became two weeks… but those weeks were online. So we had to balance out the time to make sure that each day wasn’t as draining on Zoom.
ATQH: What do you think is the impact of FIP on international students, both in typical year and during a virtual experience?
YAB: So, in a typical year, FIP provides international students with the fundamental information for a happy, successful start at Harvard, which includes sessions and discussions about American culture, immigration, and academics in the US and at Harvard. So it really helps them to get to know what it’s like to actually be here and how to socialize with American before actually socializing with Americans because of the many different quirks and things Americans do that might weird international students out. So we make sure that they know all the acronyms, all the slang words, and also how to properly interact and how to be their best self academically. So that’s what FIP typically does: it creates a community where they can get to know how to be their best selves on campus.
This last year, FIP’s meaning took on a whole new level when international students weren’t allowed on campus — because they were the only cohort of students who are basically barred from entering America, let alone campus, they were very excluded. We could see that many of the Class of 2024 were making friendship groups without international students included because they weren’t on campus, and a lot of international students felt left out and didn’t feel like they had a place because they weren’t allowed on campus. So FIP’s meaning took on a whole different level because FIP provided all these international students who felt excluded with a community of themselves where they can interact and socialize with people who are in the exact same position as them. Because of the amazing, wonderful leadership of the FIP leaders and the collaborative environment that FIP was, that was one of the biggest parts of FIP 2020: getting us this community so they could prosper outside of FIP.
ATQH: What are some of the events that FIP does during the school year to make sure that the connections between FIPpers remain?
YAB: So one of the biggest things that happen is your FIP family will have reunions all the time. I remember my freshman year, we always hung out with our leaders in their dorms and we had a great time. Once every month, we had FIP dinners and then online we had FIP reunion Zoom calls, so it’s been a really great way to keep in contact, get to know how they’re doing and how they’re progressing. FIP-wide, we have a big reunion event mid-year where every FIPper comes back together to see the rest of FIP and all the leaders are there to congratulate them on completing their first semester and see how everybody is doing.
FIP doesn’t end after the one week of pre-orientation. FIP is the experience. FIP is your first year at Harvard. FIP is your community. It transcends the week of pre-orientation beyond your wildest imagination, because it’s like you have a home for the year. And not even just a year though because many, many FIPpers then go on to be FIP leaders, because they want to give back to this amazing community and they want to help new international students succeed. So for me, FIP has been a part of my life for the past two years now. It’s not a week, it’s a lifestyle.
And for the Class of 2024, when they come back to campus, we’re setting up a new semi-orientation to help those 2024 students acclimate to campus because they’ve never been. So FIP will happen again for them in a different way. So FIP always exists on some levels and some capacity throughout the year, and Covid has and will not change that. There’s always a community to help you.
ATQH: Do you have any fun memories of FIP?
YAB: I would say my best and funniest moment of FIP was meeting my FIP family… We had a massive dance competition at 10 p.m. in Eliot courtyard where we’d dance to the end — each family presented their dances, and it was so funny because we’d see one team did the Anaconda and were twerking like there was no tomorrow, and another team did the worm. And then our team, we did just such funny dances and it was just so funny seeing every team make a fool of themselves in front of everybody because it shows we’re all so comfortable being here and being together in this community and just showing our funny sides off. And that was a moment that struck me because I was like, “Wow, this really is my community at Harvard. This really would be my home and we’re so open with each other.”
And for last year, I really enjoyed the coffee chats because we’re able to connect one-on-one with every single student. Each FIPper was able to connect with another FIPper and have a coffee chat together where they got to ask further questions to get to know each other, which is this really cool way to get on a deeper level and loads of connections were made that way. I remember making such funny connections and really deep, heartfelt connections. Yeah, it was just a really fulfilling experience and that’s something I definitely want to see again this year because we never did that before. We did it last year and it was so fulfilling, rewarding, and amazing to hear everybody’s stories and it’s a moment that really struck me last year.
ATQH: Describe FIP in three words.
YAB: Exhilarating, transformative, and community-building.
ATQH: Which Harvard House do you think embodies the spirit of FIP the most?
YAB: I would say FIP represents the Quad because we are different to American students, so we don’t have the shared experiences that many of the River Houses have — we don’t really interact with American students like that, we haven’t gone through their experiences… so we might feel distant from American students. But yet because of that, we’ve built a community within ourselves — we have our own international community, which is so powerful and so great because we get to know each other on a much more personal level, and it’s such a friendly and warm community like the Quad, where everyone knows each other. And I would say that really embodies the spirit of FIP, because we are so connected to each other as international students.

It’s not an entryway, not a House, but a community! The Dudley Community! Dudley includes the Mass Ave. and Sacramento St. Co-operatives and some students living off-campus or outside the Harvard House system. They’re practically self-run and call all of Cambridge and Boston their “home.” If you’re looking for that truly #independent experience but want to gain an amazing community at the same time, Dudley is the place for you!
Dudley is a *community* consisting of both students who live off-campus and students who live in the Dudley Co-op — their on-campus, student-run, Harvard-overseen house. Any interested students can transfer from their Harvard House to Dudley starting their sophomore year. Those interested in the Co-op apply to join a waitlist for one of the roughly 30 spots. Once accepted, students are quickly integrated into the community through Dudley-only traditions and events, including everything from cooking together nightly to a ~special~ annual study break!
Despite its widespread geography, Dudley’s community tends to revolve around the Sacramento Street Co-op, a large house that houses about 15 students. There you can expect to celebrate Valentine’s on Halloween and get married to one another (jkjk… unless) on Easter! When it comes to traditions, Dudley likes to be... unconventional. While other students celebrate Primal Scream, Dudley stays a little less primal with the Lingerie Study Break, where they go to Lamont Library in their underwear. The community warmth extends from formal get-togethers to casual inside jokes about Kenny G, their “unofficial official mascot”. Their embrace of the unexpected is what makes Dudley an always evolving and exciting community — as David J. Sabot ’22, Dudley HoCo Chair, put it, “Generally not keeping traditions has always been a tradition.”
Speaking of HoCo, while Harvard Houses have typical HoCo roles like Secretary and Social Chair, Dudley keeps it spicy. Within their housing committee, each member is given a unique title, ranging from Steward of Life and Secretary of Agriculture, to Star, for the member who is in charge of getting snacks from Star Market. Clearly, if you’re looking for a niche, you’ll find it in Dudley! But arguably the best part of Dudley is its people, who all chose to be a part of the community and clearly have a lot of love for it.
No matter who you are, you can find the right level of community at Dudley. Do you want to see other members every day and have dinner together? Join the Co-op! Are you fiercely independent, but still want to occasionally stop by for community events? Live off-campus! Dudley is a choose-your-own-adventure book!
Even with Harvard online, Dudley’s community is active and engaged, and consistently meets over Zoom, organizes within the Cambridge community, and (safely) drives together to check out farm shares. On the virtual Dudley community, HoCo Treasurer Lauren G. Fadiman ’21 said, “We’re having shared experiences, and Dudley is a lot of people doing their own thing in a cool way.”
Once students return to campus in the fall, Dean Laura Chivers’ office is often the place to find and connect with the Dudley community. According to Secretary of Agriculture Elliot J. Schiff ’21, the Dudley community stays connected when "running into each other in Dean Laura’s office, the last day you can get classes approved for pass/fail. I ran into no fewer than three friends that day.”
And for those of you that missed it, check out Dudley’s Housing Day 2021 video, a true testament to their virtual community! Only a month late, here’s Flyby’s take on the piece of art:
Kenny G <3 (This is your clickbait sign to stop everything and go watch this masterpiece to join the enlightened few who understand the immaculate Kenny G reference). We’ll leave the review at that and let you bask in the glory of Dudley for yourself (and strongly consider transferring like every writer on Flyby). Seriously, go watch. Like, now.
There are a variety of ways to approach housing as a Dudley member. You can live and eat off-campus, you can live and eat in the Co-op, or you can live off-campus and occasionally stop in for a meal. Off-campus (non-Co-op) housing can take a multitude of forms, and students usually rent out their own place.
The Co-op’s accommodations are a little more structured. There are not one, but two Co-op’s: Sacramento Street and Massachusetts Avenue. Sacramento St. used to be a bed and breakfast, so it hosts an industrial kitchen and a number of common room social spaces, whereas Massachusetts Ave. is purely residential. Each Co-op site houses about 15 people at a time, and they’re both about as far from the Yard as the Quad.
Central to the Co-op’s semi-independent living is shared responsibilities to maintain your space and feed each other. Now, cooking and cleaning for yourself may sound like a step up from the convenience of dining hall conveyor belts, but overall they really work to build community within the Co-op’s and Dudley overall! The Co-op’s chore system ensures accountability, where each member completes their chores for points, a certain number of which must be earned every two weeks. Those who live off campus can complete the chores to have dinner in the Co-op.
Speaking of food, because Dudley cooks its own meals, it’s especially great if you’re vegan or not the biggest fan of HUDS food. Fadiman, Sabot, and Schiff’s favorite Dudley meals include “zhuzhed up” leftovers — i.e. ~elevated~ leftovers and vegan pizza. And at the heart of the food they make is an effort to be sustainable.
Want to know even more about everyone’s favorite housing ~community~? Fadiman, Sabot, and Schiff have you covered! 
If Dudley was an ice cream flavor, what flavor would it be? 
DJS: I feel like it would be frozen yogurt of some kind, not ice cream.
Stay quirky, y’all. :-)
Is the misconception that Dudley is competitive housing true? 
EJS: Dudley tends to have a lot of students that are off-cycle, even before the pandemic, so if there happens to be a large wave of off-cycle students that are returning then it might be harder [to get a room]. But it’s truly, if there’s a room available for you, you can go—
LGF: Right away.
EJS: Yeah, even mid-semester.
LGF: You can join as soon as you’re a sophomore.
What are three words you would use to describe Dudley? 
LGF: The. Dudley. Community. :)
Mysterious… You’ve left us intrigued.
If all this talk about Dudley has got you thinking about how to join, it’s super easy!
All the information you need is at this link, from the Co-op info-session/vibe-check dinners to the FAQs. The next dinner is on May 2 from 11am-12:15pm ET, so sign up on the website quick!
And if you can’t make it to a dinner or want to chat with some residential Dudley Tutors for a virtual lay-of-the-land, email Co-op Tutor Julia Harris (juliaharris@g.harvard.edu) and Dudley's Undergraduate Administrator Carvina Williams (ududley@fas.harvard.edu). Maybe you’ll find yourself part of the tight-knit Dudley Co-op next semester!
CORRECTIONS: May 5, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated that all students living off-campus or outside the Harvard House system are members of the Dudley community. In fact, only some are. 
The previous version also misstated the number of students in the Dudley community. There are roughly 30 spots, split about evenly between the Sacramento Street and Massachusetts Avenue Co-op sites.
It also misstated the name of the dean overseeing the Dudley community. It is Dean Laura Chivers.
