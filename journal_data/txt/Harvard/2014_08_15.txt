Harvard Management Company, the firm that manages Harvard’s endowment, named Michael Ryan as its new head of Public Equity at the beginning of this month.
Ryan, who most recently served as the chief investment officer at MDR Capital Management in New York, will start his new role in September. He will report to Managing Director Stephen Blyth, HMC’s head of public markets and will play an important role in “in the strategy and performance of HMC’s global equity portfolio,” according to a press release.
The announcement comes alongside other recent changes in leadership at Harvard Management Company, including the impending departure of CEO Jane L. Mendillo this January, as well as the recent exit of managing director for private equity Lane MacDonald ’88-’89.
“Mike brings deep experience across global equity markets, including expertise managing large, diverse investment teams and extensive knowledge of the global landscape and hedge fund strategies,” Blyth said in the press release. “Public markets are an important driver of HMC’s returns and we are confident Mike will contribute significantly to our investment strategy and our ability to outperform our equity market benchmarks.”
Public equity had the highest returns of any HMC asset class during fiscal year 2013, with a return of 16.3 percent.
Ryan, who earned his B.A. at Yale, previously worked as co-CEO of JAI Capital Management, head of global securities at Credit Suisse, and as a partner and co-head of global equity products at the Goldman Sachs Group, according to the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joining the ranks of Oliver McNally ’12 and Keith Wright ’12, former Harvard men’s basketball co-captain Brandyn Curry ’14 will play the next leg of his hoops career on the opposite side of the Atlantic.
On Friday morning, it was announced that Curry had inked a deal with SPM Shoeters Den Bosch, one of nine current teams in the Dutch Basketball League and the winningest organization in DBL history.
"Curry is exactly what we were looking [for] at the guard position," stated SPM Shoeters coach Sam Jones in his team’s press release. "[He is a] playmaker who can lead his team. Curry is tactically and defensively very strong.”
Jones also praised the added height that the 6'1" Curry will bring to the squad’s undersized backcourt.
Last year for the Crimson, Curry averaged 9.4 points and 2.8 assists per game. The guard was an integral part of Harvard’s defensive efforts, ranking second on the team in steals with 1.4 per contest.
Curry’s ability to stretch the floor—he shot 37.3 percent from beyond the arc in 2013-2014—will translate well to the European game, which tends to reward shooters to a greater degree than its American equivalent.
The former Crimson standout will have his first chance to play the FIBA game on Sept. 10, when the SPM Shoeters visit BC Oostende.
