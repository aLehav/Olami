After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maureen Toth is the owner and principal agent of Eastern Talent Agency, an agency based in Los Angeles and New York for designers, directors, and editors. The Harvard Crimson sat down and talked with her about how she got involved in the industry, what she looks for in a client, and her advice for anyone interested in getting into the entertainment business.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get involved in the talent agent business?
Maureen Toth: Well, I worked in sales in Northern California before I came to the LA area, and I knew I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. I didn’t know exactly what I was looking to do, but a friend of mine knew a woman who owned a small agency. …He introduced me and she said, “I think you’d make a really great agent.” To make a longer story shorter, I went down to her business, watched her work, saw what they do in an agency and I thought it was very interesting. I had a background in sales, which helped, and a degree in psychology.
THC: How do you know where a client is going to fit best?
MT: You have to be really familiar with their body of work and with what their goals are. People don’t come to me and say, “I want an exact repeat of what I’ve already done.” They normally have an idea of what they want to do next and it’s my job to try to channel them in that direction. …It’s important to know who would look at their work and want them on their project. If they aren’t generating interest, it’s important for me to be able to point out what in my client’s work could be improved to generate more interest.
THC: Are there certain aspects you look for in a client?
MT: Eastern Talent Agency represents for those in film and television—except for reality TV—who are production designers, editors, hair and makeup, costume designers, and directors of photography. The first thing we look for is that they fall in the categories of what we represent. Then we look to see if they are a good fit for the types of projects we most often see. We also want to see that they have good quality material and also enough material to make producers interested in hiring them.
If someone comes in fresh out of school with no credits to their name, I would tell them to get out there and try to land a few jobs. There is a point where people are just not experienced enough. It doesn’t make sense for them fiscally, either, because as soon as you hire an agent you’re giving away part of your income. It also feels bad to have someone paying you, while you know that you can’t give them what they need. There is a right time to get an agent. …Once the agency sees that they have enough experience and that they fall in a category we represent, we sit down with them and see how relatable they are. Relatability is so important. …You can’t always know what’s going to be the “right” personality, but we can always say, “Well, this is a person that I would enjoy working with, so I’m going to extrapolate and assume that others will feel the same way.” We want to enhance the whole of the agency by taking on good people. It’s a combination of their art, where they are in their career, and their personality.
THC: Is there a specific genre that is easiest to work with or is it on an artist to artist basis?
MT: It’s a little bit of both. Every client is different, so it depends on what they’re seeking. Sometimes someone has been doing a lot of TV and decides they want to do film. Sometimes someone wants to keep doing TV but realizes that they don’t like a certain genre. There are a lot of individual style things that make clients lean towards certain projects.
That being said, I will say that people will roughly agree on what is considered “good content.” There’s good content in both film and TV right now, but there is really a ton in TV. That is because a lot of the cable establishments have upped their game recently in terms of the stories they’re willing to tell, the power they’re willing to give the storytellers, and how they’re marketing them … Netflix, for instance, is turning out some really great content. If a Netflix show that seems interesting calls, my interest is going to be piqued. A lot of people see where the good content is and they want to move towards that.
THC: It makes sense that Netflix is so popular with your clients. Recently they seem to had a lot of serious things coming out that are very artistically well done.
MT: Well, Netflix is only one example. I think it started with HBO and Showtime turning out really great content on their stations. …Very soon after that we started to see Netflix and AMC and Amazon saying, “I want to do what they’re doing.” I think a lot of good content comes from taking chances because you’re allowing someone creative to control the process a little more. The boom of the cable streaming industry has fed the creative growth of narrative television.
THC: What is your favorite part of your job?
MT: I think it’s interfacing with clients. My very favorite part is calling up a client and telling them that you landed them a really great interview.
Also, it’s good when the job turns out to be a really great experience. Sometimes you don’t know. Sometimes you see it and you think, “This looks amazing and I think it’s going to be great for you.” Then they go in, get the job, but start to have a hard time for one reason or another. Sometimes the show doesn’t turn out to be the hit you thought it was going to be. Things don’t always work out because there are so many factors.
THC: What advice would you give to someone who is looking to start in the industry?
MT: You want to make sure this is really something you want to do because you’re about to invest a lot of time and energy into it. This applies to any field really, but especially this one. Particularly this one, because the charm of this industry is often not matched by the experience. …These people work very, very hard, they work long hours, and sometimes they’re well paid but sometimes they aren’t. You want to understand all the nuances of it.
Obviously going to school for your craft is a great plan. But also apprenticing under someone who is fantastic is a great thing to do. You should go on informational interviews to talk to the people you admire to find out what they love, what they don’t like, how they got into the business and what inspires them… All of that information is amazing and can help you get to where you want to go.
Plus, it helps you make contacts. Contacts are important but especially in this field, probably because so much of it is who you know. Having a few people in the field who can mentor you is an amazing thing. …I would seek out mentors.
The other thing is that you want to be in the place that can get you there. If you want to be a cinematographer, it doesn’t serve you to live in Montana. There is going to be a point where you need to be in a place that’s going to provide you with opportunities. …There are hubs of entertainment activity and you should seek them out and figure out what you can tolerate. That will help you get to where you want to go faster.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a proposal for a bridge program, called the First Year Institute, designed to ease the transition for low-income and first-generation college students. As we have opined before, a bridge program is critically missing at the College, and the Dean’s decision to opt for a “Advocate” instead of a bridge-program is misguided. The rejection of the First Year Institute is a failure of the College to truly integrate low income students, first generation college students, and students from under-resourced high schools.
Rather than create a bridge program, the College plans to hire a part-time “First-Gen Low Income Student Advocate” within the Freshman Dean’s Office. No matter how slickly “First-Gen Low Income Student Advocate” rolls off the tongue, this new position will not fix the glaring problems at hand. Students who come from any of the backgrounds towards which the First Year Institute was targeted will enter Harvard without the skills and resources many of their peers already have. A single bureaucrat will not be able to teach these students the skills they did not pick up in high school or their own households.
Moreover, every experience is different and what students know varies. The creation of a single “advocate” in lieu of a bridge program provides a one-size-fits-all solution that fails to recognize the purpose of the proposed bridge program: to allow disadvantaged students to gain skills their high schools or backgrounds did not provide them in a dynamic and interactive environment that they can leverage to address their particular needs. More importantly, it takes away the agency from individual students to address their own needs in a setting that presents them with all available resources. As it stands now, disadvantaged students are less prepared to take on Harvard—academically, socially, and emotionally—and are no less likely to take their first year in stride.
Dean Khurana’s decision to reject the First Year Program will prevent a significant portion of the College from taking advantages of the opportunities promised to them. When students are not given the support they need, they struggle to find a sense of belonging and end up questioning their place at the College. His decision not only goes against his long-standing philosophy of prioritizing inclusion, but is also a direct failure to the students who come from under-resourced backgrounds.
We object not only to the content of Dean Khurana's decision but also its dissemination. By not making public any justification for his decision, he has shown disrespect towards the students who have put years of work into this proposal. Dean Khurana should make his decision-making process clear. A public statement, potentially through a College-wide email, would help those frustrated by his decision and help students to move forward with a constructive solution. We also hope that, in the future, when students invest time and energy to propose solutions to issues on campus, adminstrators will listen more actively. We hope this recent decision does not develop into a broader trend of ignoring student input.
Harvard has a responsibility to support the students it admits. By rejecting the bridge program proposal, Dean Khurana has not only disregarded the efforts of students who poured hours of their time into the idea, but also strayed from the agenda he has pushed as Dean of the College. If Harvard is to make good on its promises to students, the College must invest in real solutions rather than half-hearted attempts to placate student voices.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a running joke among my friends freshman year that when I would introduce myself, the first thing to always shoot out of my mouth was “Yeah, I’m from like, basically Mexico!”
I would like to think that I was always talking about my hometown of Brownsville, Tex., because I am genuinely proud to be from there. However, Brownsville is a border town that’s consistently ranked one of the poorest and least educated cities in America, so I know that explanation isn’t true. I talked about home so much because I needed to constantly validate my existence at Harvard—why I was afraid to speak in section, why I didn’t want to go out and feel excluded from listed final club parties, and why no matter how hard I tried I still never felt like I belonged.
The decision by the College to not go forward with a transition program for students from low-income, first-generation, or underrepresented backgrounds is a direct slap in the face to someone like me. I value myself as something as more than just a financial aid statistic or a Latina face on an admissions pamphlet, but I’m not sure if the College does too.
A transition program won’t stop the scores of New York kids and prep school alumni from forming cliques before class has even begun. It won’t eliminate experiences like the one I had in my freshman government seminar, where everyone came in having experience interning in D.C. or talking about their politically powerful parents, making me feel like I had nothing to contribute. But maybe, just maybe, it will make future students like me feel like this is their Harvard too.
While the idea of an advisor for low-income students seems helpful, I don’t think an adult handing me yet another pamphlet on the Bureau of Study Counsel is the best answer to our issues. If I had gotten to know professors in a relaxed environment like the one provided by bridge programs at other schools, I would not have been afraid to attend office hours until after spending a full year at Harvard, and even then, maybe I wouldn’t have panicked for 20 minutes before I finally got the courage to walk into a professor’s door.
I would have gotten the chance to experience what a class discussion is like and how to contribute thoughtfully to one after spending four years in a high school classroom staring at powerpoints and regurgitating memorized information. I would have come into freshman fall with a community of students who were like me, better prepared to tackle the incredibly confusing social scene at this school which is far too often based on class. I would have been aware of and better prepared to adopt the social and academic norms at this school that other students from more privileged backgrounds have internalized since kindergarten.
I have never gone back to my high school to speak about Harvard. I would love to, because there are so many kids from my hometown that deserve this chance at the life that a Harvard degree could give them. However, I’m scared for them. I am scared to tell them to chase their dreams only to have them step foot on campus and have this place break the resilient spirit that growing up in a city like mine gives someone. Students like me need a stepping stone into an environment like Harvard. We need to be guided in how to use our diverse backgrounds to speak, not to be silent.
I’m about to mark my halfway point through Harvard and some days I still feel like I’m struggling to stay afloat. Please, Harvard, don’t let the students who come after me drown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I spent this past spring break with the Phillips Brook House Association, volunteering as a teacher’s assistant in a high school in D.C. High school classrooms have never been enclaves of Puritan discipline, but the school’s policy of providing every student with a personal laptop added an extra layer of chaos. Students surfed the internet, quickly clicking to assignments when they sensed me approach. Some kept one earplug in as the teacher spoke. It was even more unnerving, however, to stand at the front of the classroom and make eye contact with nobody. There were just twenty glowing pupils, fixed somewhere and in some other time.
I can’t blame the students. I never used a laptop in school until I came to Harvard, but the habit is easily acquired, and I’m typing this during a lecture. I can’t imagine what it would have been like, and how I would be different, if I had grown up with a screen in all my classrooms. Beyond the (deservedly researched and debated) sub-question of whether we learn better in digital or analog is the question of how screens have eroded our crucial relationship to the spatial and temporal world. The ability to devote sustained attention to the place and moment at hand is not only valuable to our pursuits, but also key to having autonomy in and enjoying life. It is also something that all of us are increasingly relinquishing.
As part of the PBHA trip, we toured museums and memorials around the capital. People kept taking selfies with the Lincoln Memorial: running to the foot of the statue, extending their arms, and leaving. Their visits to the memorials, spaces meticulously designed to shape their visitors’ reflections, became just another place and time occupied by social media, cellphone photography, and email. It could have been a bedroom, the subway, a restaurant, a mountain summit; everywhere we are, everyone we are with, everything we have experienced, rather than retaining an individual sense of time and place and event, is preserved in the blue glow of a screen. The environment of which we are most conscious is the screen, which collapses time and space and severs us from a previously unquestionable state of existence—as three-dimensional beings in corporeal environments. We lose touch with the world’s fabric, which seems increasingly broken up by various white rectangles.
This topic, beyond being pertinent to my column’s theme of physical spaces and the way they shape us, is a personal vendetta. I periodically grumble about Snapchat—god, I hate Snapchat—or my tortured relationship with my iPhone. I’m sure I sound like a naïve, past-romanticizing grouch to these technologies’ dedicated users, who are many in number; and so, in drafts of this column, I tried to distance myself from my personal conviction.
I tried including the scientific aspect: what effect does all this screen time actually have on our physiological and neurological processes? Is it actually bad for us? I tried analyzing philosophical aspects: What is a “space”? Is the Internet a real space? What is “real”? I tried using things I have learned from my environmental history tutorial: using broader concepts of “space” and “environment”—for example, understanding the body as an environment, and space as anything from the span of a continent to the distance from plant to predator in food chains—we saw how alterations to these relationships can change everything, from our bodies to the development of modern civilization.
But while I think it is important to be able to learn most efficiently, to preserve eyesight, to stop pining for others’ lives, and to understand how physical distributions still very concretely shape our reality—and while I also understand that there are myriad ways in which screen technologies have drastically increased quality of life—my irrepressible, unscientific vitriol stems from the fact that I am viscerally afraid. I am afraid that screens are terminally accelerating life; I am afraid that as everything streams away in little lost moments, I will be left with no tangible sense of where and when I’ve been, only the impression of thousands of webpages surfed and emails read and videos watched. To move from update to notification to photo-op, from link to link, is to always be anticipating and never be “there,” in the mental or physical sense.
The Information Age demands data, but maybe the best information I can offer is experiential: There’s a small but tremendously positive difference to actually see sunlight first thing in the morning instead of a soulless, white, pixelated glare and in hearing snippets of bizarre, poignant, infuriating, and enlightening dialogue in passing. My month without any social media this winter break was the first time I’d felt truly awake in a long, long time, which made the quality of my memories denser and richer.
And so I feared not only for those D.C. students’ educational experiences and ability to learn, but also for their lives, and for all of ours. Any lecturer here looking into his audience will also see the pearly forms of Apple logos and downcast eyes.
When I talk to Harvard graduates, or even older students, many express regret that their time here felt like it went by too fast, that they were gone before they were ever really here. I hope that when I walk across the stage in Tercentenary Theater, I will have done the most I can to avoid that. It’s hard, and by all appearances I’m a stinking hypocrite: I’ve spent at least five hours staring at screens today, some by necessity and quite a bit out of compulsion. I can shut my laptop down when I don’t need it, keep my phone squirreled deeply and inconveniently in my backpack. Maybe someday I’ll build up to the discipline to get the flip phone I’ve been lusting after. At the very least, I look forward to walking down Garden Street after I finish this, and enjoying the buildings around me, the air on my face, the green span of Cambridge Common, the staccato spacing of stone slabs in the Old Burial Ground, and the luxury of a solitary walk. The automatons may be coming for our jobs, and the Snapchat lovers may be coming for my blood, but personal-use screens don’t have to take my world just yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 31, 2017 at 1:21 a.m.
Harvard admitted 5.2 percent of applicants to the College’s Class of 2021 Thursday, accepting 2,056 students of the nearly 40,000 applicants and posting an acceptance rate roughly equal to that of last year.
Harvard offered 1,118 students admission to the College Thursday through the regular application process. They join 938 applicants who were notified of their acceptance last December under the early action program into the Class of 2021.
After receiving a record 39,506 applications, the College’s acceptance rate is marginally lower than that of the previous year—5.20 percent this year, versus 5.22 percent for the Class of 2020.
The pool of accepted students represents a small decrease in total percentage of minorities from previous years, with largest decreases in Latino admits—from 12.7 percent for the Class of 2020 to 11.6 percent for the Class of 2021—and Native American admits, from 2.2 percent to 1.9 percent.
Certain racial groups, however, did see increased representation. African American students make up a record-high 14.6 percent of admitted students, an increase from 14.0 percent last year.
Amid a lawsuit alleging that Harvard discriminates against Asian American students in its undergraduate admissions processes, Asian American students make up a 22.2 percent of the admitted class, up marginally from a then record-high 22.1 percent last year.
Students who will be the first in their family to attend college comprise 15.1 percent of the admitted pool. The College will dedicate a new part-time “student advocate” to advising first-generation and low-income students, though Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a proposed summer program tailored towards those students earlier this semester.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, a first-generation college student himself, attributed the slight increase in part to the “startup grant,” a program started last fall that gives approximately one-fifth of incoming Harvard freshmen—many of whom are first-generation—$2,000 to adjust to extra costs in the first months of college.
“I’m very excited because I would have received one,” Fitzsimmons said. “I think you end up with enormous freedom and flexibility, especially in that critical first year.”
Slightly less than half—49.2 percent—of the accepted students are women, up from 48.4 percent the previous year.
In a slight downward trend, 15.5 percent of students indicated interest in studying the humanities, down from 16.9 percent the previous year. A plurality—26.5 percent—indicated interest in the social sciences, while 19.3 percent said they planned to study computer science and engineering.
International students comprise 11.4 percent of the admitted pool, and Fitzsimmons said he did not see an impact on international applications despite uncertainty generated by President Donald Trump’s recent orders limiting travel and immigration from a number of countries.
Fitzsimmons said the admissions department’s decisions were partly influenced by a report published last year encouraging admissions officers to evaluate college applicants beyond academics and traditional extracurriculars.
“I look at [the report]’ as one of these really important long-term efforts of breaking down stereotypes of what colleges are and what they’re trying to do,” he said. “We value whatever it is that people have done in addition to study.”
Admitted students will have the opportunity to stay at Harvard for Visitas, which is scheduled to run from April 22 through 24. Students will then have until May 1 to respond to their offer of admission.
Applicants to the seven other Ivy League schools also received admissions decisions Thursday. Yale—which will open two new residential colleges in the fall—accepted a record 2,272 students, or 6.9 percent of its total applicant pool. Columbia posted the second-lowest acceptance rate in the Ivy League, at 5.8 percent, while Princeton offered admission to 6.1 percent of applicants. Elsewhere in Cambridge, MIT accepted 7.1 percent of its applicants earlier than this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The owner of the former Harvard Square Theater property has not made public his plans for the property more than a month after the Cambridge City Council gave him 30 days to do so.
The theater was a Harvard Square icon from its opening in 1925 until it closed in 2012. Morningside Group, a firm headed by billionaire investor and Harvard donor Gerald L. Chan, purchased the property in 2015 from real estate developer Richard L. Friedman.
The property has remained vacant since 2012, drawing concern from local residents and city officials who say that the property was an important economic driver in the Square. At its Feb. 27 meeting, the Cambridge City Council threatened to seize the building by eminent domain if it did not soon receive a public update.
While the Morningside Group did not respond to repeated requests for comment, City Councillor Jan Devereux said she’s hopeful Chan will respond with plans in April.
“I think the policy order was effective in underscoring the urgency the Council, the City, and the Harvard Square community feel in seeing the Church Street theater site renovated and reactivated without further delay,” Devereux said. “I look forward to seeing some initial plans this spring and to the opportunity to further engage the community in the successful repurposing of this anchor site.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she is convinced Chan will start to make plans for the property.
“I feel confident that if Mr. Chan gave his assurance to the mayor, that he would comply with their request,” Jillson said. “I think he’s an honorable man and will keep his word.”
Chan owns a bevy of properties in the Square, including a number along JFK St. and the surrounding area. His Harvard Square portfolio is valued at more than $100 million. In the fall of 2014, he donated $350 million to the Harvard School of Public Health, which was then renamed in honor of Chan’s father.

Though many freshmen compete for seats on Harvard’s Undergraduate Council each year, it’s less typical for students to run for local office.
But a Harvard freshman from Portland, Ore., Nadya Okamoto ’20, intends to do just that, announcing Wednesday a bid for a spot on the Cambridge City Council.
The founder of a women’s health nonprofit, PERIOD, Okamoto said her platform will center around affordable housing, education equity, youth engagement with politics, and maximizing  local universities’ contributions to Cambridge.
The last Harvard student to run for City Council was 26-year-old Logan E. Leslie ’16 in 2013. Leslie, a freshmen at the time, campaigned for increased student representation in the city. He came in 14th in the election, missing out on one of the nine seats up for grabs that year.
Okamoto said she feels deeply committed to making a difference in Cambridge.
“Originally I was inspired [to run] because I am very connected to a lot of issues Cambridge is facing today,” Okamoto said. “For example, affordable housing and the homelessness crisis—those are things my family has experienced.”
This year’s election will be held Nov. 7. Okamoto said her team of seven full-time organizers will be working on campaigning over the summer.
Okamoto said that regardless of the election results, she hopes her campaign can get out the vote among Harvard students, and, more broadly, inspire youth to get involved in local government.
“This whole idea is really young people coming on and not just being an intern but running it—anyone from our campaign director to our field director to our director of local engagement [are] all young people,” Okamoto said.
After the 2016 presidential election, Okamoto encouraged other young people to vote and run for office. Then, Okamoto said, someone suggested she run herself.
“I realized my only answer was that I was too young, which was kind of a huge turning point for me,” Okamoto said. “I wanted to not only speak with my truth but also live it out, which is why I am really committed to running now.”
City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said he enjoyed meeting with Okamoto and hearing about her platform.
“I was super impressed with Nadya,” Mazen said. “Nadya came with—despite her young age—incredible spirit and incredible energy, but also incredible knowledge about how to lead people, about how to build communities, about how to fight for social justice.”
Mazen said he valued Okamoto’s focus on “issues and people,” as well as her hope to ensure local university programs benefit Cambridge as much as possible. He said he was also struck by her dedication to social justice issues and her past nonprofit work.
“All of that blends together to make someone who has a very compelling message,” Mazen said.
Mazen also said he was excited about the possibility for Okamoto to mobilize students on Harvard’s campus. Having worked on social justice issues as an undergraduate at MIT, Mazen spoke of students’ “deep desire to get involved in community.”
Mazen said that while Cantabrigians tend to be wary of university decision-makers who may not represent local communities, he thinks Okamoto could help bridge Harvard and Cambridge through programming and cooperation.
“I think obviously Nadya is poised to do that at an incredibly important time for university impact in underserved neighborhoods,” Mazen said.
Okamoto said that if elected, she would focus on relations between Harvard and Cambridge. She said she hopes to channel “the brainpower and innovation and the resources of Harvard to give back into the local community around us.”
She also said she would consider taking a leave of absence from school in order to be fully committed to the Council.
“I want to be the City Councillor who really invests their time and their efforts to actually listening to constituents,” she said. “People are depending on you.”

Harvard Medical School will launch its first online certificate program this summer for people considering health careers, offering four paid courses on topics in medicine.
The program, titled “HMX Fundamentals,” will be open to the public through a brief application and includes courses in physiology, immunology, biochemistry and genetics. Upon completion of a course, students will receive a PDF certificate which will not count for academic credit at Harvard.
Unlike Harvard’s edX and HarvardX platforms, which offer their online classes for free, access to HMX Fundamentals will come at a cost. Tuition will cost $800 for a single HMX Fundamentals course, $1,000 for two courses, and $1,800 for all four.
Medical School Associate Dean for Online Learning Michael J. Parker said that the course is designed for students considering a career in medicine, and aims to lay a foundation in “topics that are important to the future of medical care.”
“We first really started speaking three years ago to talk about how to influence student preparation and what comes before medical school,” Parker said. “Part of the thinking was that we get students of all sorts of backgrounds, so it was important to think about how to level the playing field before they reach this stage of training.”
Last summer, Khon Kaen University in Thailand participated in the pilot program for HMX Fundamentals. The school has since renewed its participation in the program.
“We’ve already been working with them essentially with pilot versions of these courses and have some of their students use the course,” Parker said. “It’s been a wonderful way to refine and improve the courses and we think that the courses at this point are ready to launch to the broader public and are very mature to be used.”
Parker said that the HMX program is designed for a wide range of people, from advanced high school students to professionals seeking medical training.
Each HMX course was developed “from scratch” in collaboration with Harvard lecturers, clinical faculty members, and the HMX teaching staff, according to Parker. The courses will emphasize clinical applications as well as interactive learning.
Students will be exposed to medical scenarios filmed in Harvard-affiliated hospitals, allowing them to work through real-life applications of concepts.
“We’re not just teaching foundational science,” Parker said, “but we’re also showing how it really applies in real life by giving access to how a doctor thinks and how they apply foundational knowledge in practice.”
Parker said that each course will include “a high degree of assessment” and an interactive forum for students to ask teaching staff questions about the content.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Popular on-campus fashion shows Eleganza and Identities co-hosted a town hall event on Thursday to discuss ways to make their events more diverse and inclusive, including casting a representative array of models and accommodating models who are uncomfortable with revealing clothing.
Last semester, Eleganza’s model selection process came under scrutiny because a casting call for models included the phrase, “Ladies, bring your heels!” Critics of the casting call said they thought it constricted potential models to conform to traditional notions of gender. Afterwards, Eleganza Publicity Co-Chair Simone E.A. Abegunrin ’18 worked with students to rephrase the statement to be more gender-inclusive.
At the town hall in the Winthrop Junior Common Room, Eleganza board members recounted the controversy, and brainstormed other ideas to make the show—which occurs during Visitas weekend and is attended by hundreds—a more inclusive and comfortable environment.
Minahil A. Khan ’18, Eleganza’s Diversity Chair, said the show’s staff hopes to allow all students to participate, even though the fashion world tends to be exclusive.
“We know that a lot of the narratives surrounding shows like Identities and Eleganza are about the glamour and the kind of fun of it,” Khan said. “Not everyone ends up feeling included and not everyone feels represented.”
Abegunrin said she was pleased to see Eleganza’s recent shift to “merit-based” casting, which aims to include talented models who might not otherwise be represented in the fashion industry.
“I saw physical body diversity where people who wouldn’t have been casted in the real fashion world, but were excellent dancers, were featured prominently and some of them were even the main dancers in the show,” she said. “It seems like they are actively casting people who seem like they can do the work.”
Aside from casting methods, Eleganza and Identities members discussed methods to ensure models are comfortable in photoshoots. Abegunrin said she would give models more alternatives to avoid uncomfortable situations in the future, adding she would “work with them” to discuss other ways to express themselves through clothing.
Both groups also discussed removing financial barriers to attending Identities and Eleganza—both charged $15 for admission last year.
“Right now, we are considering how to formulate our ticket strategy, so hearing feedback about...how to make ticketing more accessible and more inclusive is something that's so pertinent to the current things we are talking about as an organization,” Eleganza Executive Producer Lydia Tahraoui ’19 said.
Previously, Eleganza offered “VIP tickets” to final clubs, although students said Thursday that the system has been discontinued.
Tyler J. Frances ’18, a Co-Creative Director and Executive Producer of Identities, said he hopes both groups continue to work together to address issues of diversity.
“I think that having more open cross-communication between the two organizations could really benefit both groups...I think that really gives us more insight into what works with Identities, not just what it’s like to work as Identities,” Frances said.
Khan added that both shows hope to co-host town halls with affinity and BGLTQ student groups in the future.

Remembering Will Zhang, India G. McAlister, Zhang’s college friend, recalls an intelligent, humble friend with a passion for Greek philosophy, international law, and finding the best steak in Toronto.
“I think we should remember him as being a very multilayered person. He was able to be at one hand very thoughtful and very deep. He enjoyed deep conversation and philosophy. On the other hand, he was kind of like a child in the sense that he just loved doing things that were fun,” McAlister said. “He was someone whose passion and whose love for life was definitely contagious.”
Zhang, a first-year student at Harvard Law School, died March 23. He was 23. At his family’s request, The Crimson is not publishing the cause of his death, which is not considered suspicious.
His friends and peers remember a down-to-earth student who loved the musical “Cabaret” and weekly poker meetings alike. McAlister remembers watching “Jeopardy!” with Zhang as an undergraduate at the University of Toronto’s Trinity College, where he would answer the questions before everyone else had even finished reading them.
“He was just out of this world when it came to his mental acuity. He just could read fast, he could think fast. He just had a really large knowledge base, but he was also one of the most fun people to be around,” McAlister said.
Born in Dalian, China, Zhang grew up in Toronto, Canada. He attended Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario and graduated from the University of Toronto in 2016. As a student at the Law School, Zhang was involved in the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, the China Law Association, and the Harvard Federalist Society. Before coming to the Law School, Zhang worked as a research analyst at the NATO Association of Canada, according to its website.
Brian Yu, another of Zhang’s friends from college, remembers playing weekly poker games with Zhang and “the boys.”
“What impressed me the most about Will is his enthusiasm. Simply put, Will was ‘down’ for anything. If you wanted to go for Vietnamese food in the middle of the night at 3am, he would be there. If there was no space in the car, we would sit on each other's laps,” Yu wrote in an email.
Yu wrote that Zhang would have been a great lawyer.
“In this line of work, quite frankly, honestly, integrity, and trustworthiness are not common attributes. Will possessed all these qualities and more,” Yu said. “That was why I was so pleased to hear that he was accepted to Harvard Law. I was pleased not only for him, but for society as a whole — here was a guy that I know would uphold the highest standards of the Bar.”
As a member of APALSA, Zhang was a frequent contributor to club activities and initiatives, according to  the club’s presidents Amanda Chan and Kevin Jiang.
“In APALSA he was an active member starting from our first orientation event of the year. Throughout the semester, he was part of our conference committee, a group that worked on organizing our annual conference on law and policy, and a regular attendee to our other events,” Chan and Jiang wrote in an email. “As someone close to the Asian and Asian American communities here at HLS, Will was always eager to help and learn more about APALSA’s efforts to help promote Asian faculty diversity.”
Friends held a memorial service for Zhang in Toronto on March 26. Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow wrote in an email to students on the day of Zhang’s death that the Law School was looking for ways to commemorate him.
Both McAlister and Yu said Zhang was a role model to many who knew him. Scott Tsang, a high school classmate, said he respected and looked up to Zhang.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will increase student stipends by 1.5 percent in the 2017-2018 academic year, an unusually small increase that GSAS Dean Xiao-Li Meng attributed to poor returns on Harvard’s endowment.
The value of Harvard’s endowment dropped by almost $2 billion in fiscal year 2016, a plunge that has strained budgets across the University and particularly at GSAS. In addition to cutting the size of the stipend increase—last year, GSAS students received a 3 percent bump in their stipends—GSAS will admit 4.4 percent fewer students next year.
In an email to GSAS students, Meng pointed to Harvard’s investment woes as a factor of the modest stipend raise, which trails the current rate of inflation.
“In the fall, Harvard learned that a disappointing financial return on the University’s endowment would create significant financial challenges across the University,” he wrote. “We needed a solution to the problem of meeting increased expenses with flat revenues.”
Meng wrote that the rising cost of health insurance also influenced GSAS administrators.
Some graduate students, including some involved in the unionization effort at the school, said the news was disappointing.
"It just shows that the people making these decisions have no sense of what’s important to graduate students and it just makes abundantly clear that students need to have an active voice in these matters," Sam Klug, a GSAS student and union organizer, said.
The cost of housing will also increase. As GSAS student stipends increase by 1.5 percent next year, rent for GSAS dorms will also increase by 1.5 percent. Rent for Harvard University Housing—Harvard-owned apartments whose rent is controlled by the University, not GSAS—will increase by 3 percent on average.
Some students said that the size of their stipend increase will not cover the increase in housing costs.
“I might have to provide other sources of income,” Sam D. Ewing, a graduate student and union supporter, said. “This adds years to the degree. It pulls time and energy away from scholarship.”
But not all students said they disagree with the decision to raise stipends by 1.5 percent.
“My reaction to the news is that the lower-than-usual stipend increase...was a very reasonable decision made by the University administrators,” Jae Hyeon Lee, a graduate student, wrote in an email. “Providing a higher stipend increase this year would have forced the University to accept a lot fewer students...which I don't think is a good thing from the perspective of increasing diversity.”
Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, a student unionization effort,wrote in a statement that a union would help prevent lackluster stipend increases in the future.
“One of the core reasons to have a union is so we have a say in our compensation. With a union, the administration would have to bargain with us before making any changes, and we would democratically decide a contract,” union organizers wrote on the group’s Facebook page. “ That contract could guarantee rates of pay increase for future years. Without a union, the administration can make changes at any time without consent.”
Meng’s announcement about stipends comes in the middle of a student unionization election at Harvard. The University and HGSU-UAW have until April 3 to submit post-hearing briefs to the National Labor Relations Board. After receiving these documents, the NLRB could decide the fate of student unionization at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The president of a national umbrella group for several Harvard fraternities condemned Wednesday the College's decision to be more lenient with all-female groups in the enforcement of penalties on members of single-gender groups.
In an interview earlier this week, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich discussed a “bridge” program that would allow Harvard’s all-female final clubs and sororities to retain their “gender focus” for at least three years. Membership in other single-gender groups will be penalized beginning with the Class of 2021. 
His comments have drawn the ire of the national leaders of some Greek organizations.
“Harvard’s decision to allow only women’s groups to continue operating as single-gender organizations affirms why we must.... aggressively defend students’ rights,” North-American Interfraternity Conference President and CEO Judson Horras wrote in his statement.
In a separate statement, Dani Weatherford, the executive director of the National Panhellenic Conference—a national umbrella group for sororities—wrote that while the group is “cautiously optimistic about this shift in posture regarding women’s organizations, it’s clear that significant questions remain—most immediately for men’s groups.”
“Ultimately, we do not view support for single-gender organizations and progress toward greater inclusion as mutually exclusive concepts,” Weatherford wrote.
Friedrich said that the committee tasked with implementing the College’s penalties against single-gender social groups had agreed that all-female groups needed to be distinguished from their all-male counterparts due to historic inequalities facing women at the College.
“There’s value in continuing to support gender-focused organizations among those groups that have been historically women’s organizations,” Friedrich said, though he qualified that gender-focused missions must exist simultaneously with “substantive advancement toward full inclusion.”
Horras took a different view.
“Harvard’s original policy trampled students’ association rights, and it now serves as a blatant form of gender discrimination,” he wrote, adding that it “must be vigorously challenged.”
In an emailed statement, Friedrich responded to the statements from Horras and Weatherford. “Harvard College’s educational mission is rooted in a residential learning model that does not support a Greek system,” he wrote.
He added, however, that the College “[welcomes] opportunities to discuss with students how social organizations can help create an inclusive social environment for undergraduates.”
Days after the historic policy—which, starting with the Class of 2021, will bar members of single-gender social groups from team captaincies, fellowships, and leadership positions—was announced in May 2016, hundreds of Harvard women protested what they described as the policy’s unfair targeting of women’s groups.
This is not the first time Horras and Weatherford have commented on the sanctions.
In a joint statement with several other umbrella groups for national Greek organizations, Horras and Weatherford wrote in May 2016 that while they largely agreed with Harvard’s aim of “creating a safe and equitable environment for students,” they believe that Harvard “mistakenly assumes the way to achieve those ends is to punish students for participating in single-gender organizations.”
Four of Harvard’s five local fraternity chapters—Sigma Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon—are affiliated with the North-American Interfraternity Conference.
All four of Harvard’s local sorority chapters—Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma—are affiliated with the National Panhellenic Conference.

The Harvard Divinity School Augmented and Virtual Reality Collective hosted an event Thursday featuring a series of speakers and demonstrations examining the ways in which technology can influence neuroscience and meditation.
At the event, speakers presented medical and scientific research related to the mind. Dr. Jeffrey D. Rediger, a Harvard Medical School professor and Medical Director at McLean Hospital, described studying a hundred cancer patients who had experienced spontaneous remission.
He said the trends challenged his skepticism of spiritual and psychological healing methods.
“In medicine, we’re embarrassed by them, we call them flukes. After a while, after you talk to these people, you start to see this pattern,” Rediger said. “I think these things happen outside of what we understand about the physical laws of nature.”
MIT research scientist Andreas Mershin spoke about the importance of nurturing curiosity.
“If we sustain it, if we ask better questions, we start becoming a much more powerful community and much more powerful individuals,” Mershin said. “Questions are more powerful than answers.”
Also at the event, Baruti KMT-Sisouvong, director of Cambridge’s Transcendental Meditation Program, evaluated the role of transcendentalist thought on the individual and society.
Technology demonstrations following the speaker portion of the event. They included demonstrations of “When We Die,” a virtual reality program designed to prompt contemplation of mortality, and “Chi,” an app designed to provide a virtual reality simulation of Tai Chi.
The Virtual Reality Collective hosted the group Consciousness Hacking, a Cambridge-based association of thinkers at the event. Consciousness Hacking is a collective that aims to explore technology as a pathway towards “psychological, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing,” according to the group’s website. Their research focuses on technology and neuroscience.
“This is hopefully a community that lives their questions, which is totally exciting and exactly what I hoped for,” said Adam H. Horowitz, a leader of Consciousness Hacking and a co-organizer of the event.
Those goals are similar to the work that the Augmented & Virtual Reality Collective hopes to tackle.
“I came to HDS essentially to ask the larger question of what kind of world we are building in this technological landscape, and how can we build for well-being and really the whole human being,” said Tim L. Gallati, a student at the Divinity School and founder of the Augmented & Virtual Reality Collective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Catherine Wang, a senior at Lexington High School in Lexington, Mass., wasn’t expecting much to happen on March 30. Though she had applied to Harvard, she wasn’t too sure of her chances—after all, she had only begun writing her application essay, on “naked mole rats,” two hours before it was due.
As her Science Bowl practice wound down, Wang sat cross-legged on a table and decided to check her online Harvard applicant portal. As the website loaded a letter inviting her to join the Class of 2021, she registered what had happened and “forgot that keeping balance was a thing,” she recounted.
“I just kind of fell over,” Wang said. “It’s just really embarrassing because I just fell over.”
Wang is one of the lucky 2,056 high school students admitted on to the Class of 2021, representing 5.2 percent of the total applicant pool. Joining 938 students notified of their acceptances last December in the early admissions cycle, Wang and 1,117 others received the good news at 5 p.m. on Thursday.
The “thick packets” from 86 Brattle Street will arrive at the students’ homes in the coming days, filled with Visitas invitations and laptop stickers. But as of Thursday, the long wait for the decision was already over.
Over 200 miles away from Lexington, Tina Lu—a senior at Whippany Park High School in N. J.—was in the car with her father, eagerly waiting to hear from Harvard. As Lu read the message off of her cell phone, she shouted and shoved the phone into her father’s face.
“He started laughing and hugging me, and it was a great moment,” Lu said. “It was amazing.”
Though Wang and Lu’s acceptance stories occurred only minutes apart, some stories of elation took place months ago.
On Dec. 14, with early admissions decisions scheduled to come out that day, Jocelyn Tolpin—a senior at Newark Academy in N. J.—took off early from school, bought herself some sushi, and watched a vampire film in bed. She turned her phone off—“I didn’t want to be stressed out and counting down the seconds,” she said.
As the movie ended and the clock struck 5:02 p.m., Tolpin rushed to open the portal—and promptly “blacked out.”
“Next thing I remember, I was on the floor outside my room and I’m absolutely crying and screaming at the top of my lungs,” Tolpin said. “It was an amazing experience and it's still kind of very surreal.“
The accepted high school students have been invited to attend Visitas from April 22-24, and will be given until May 1 to decide where they plan to matriculate. Some students are currently weighing several offers of admission from peer institutions. Wang, who was also accepted early action to Stanford, will be faced with the decision of deciding between the East and West Coasts.
“I am excited for California,” Wang said, “but I definitely am seriously considering Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­This Saturday, the Harvard Women’s Lacrosse team will travel to Hanover, N.H. to take on Ivy League foe Dartmouth. The Crimson’s third conference game of the season comes just four days after a narrow 10-9 loss to Stanford, in which the Crimson blew an 8-4 lead in the last 20 minutes of the contest.
“After the close loss to Stanford on Tuesday we’re excited to get back on the field practicing before Saturday’s game against Dartmouth,” tri-captain Megan Hennessey said. “We want to focus on beating a sagging zone defense and cleaning up the 50/50 plays, such as draw controls and ground balls.”
This will be a tall task, as Dartmouth (5-3, 0-2 Ivy League) boasts sophomore midfielder Katherine Giroux, whose 52 draw controls lead the Ancient Eight. Behind the sophomore’s efforts, the Big Green is third in the country for draw controls per game.
However, Giroux will face a tough opponent in Crimson tri-captain Maeve McMahon, who herself has 44 draw controls, coming in third in the Ancient Eight. It looks not only to be an entertaining match-up, but also an important one, as draw controls are critical in setting the tone of the game and establishing possession.
“We are preparing for [Dartmouth] to have a lot of energy and aggression because it’s a big Ivy League game and Ivy League teams always come out full of energy,” senior attacker Marisa Romeo said. “A lot is at stake.”
While the Crimson (5-4, 2-0 Ivy League) is looking to bounce back from its loss against Stanford, the Big Green will hope to replicate the success achieved in its last game against Siena, which ended in a lopsided 16-6 victory. Crucial to the win was senior attacker Courtney Weisse, whose five goals in the game brought her season total to a team-leading 27. The senior is currently ranked 28th in the country for goals per game.
Paired with sophomore midfielder Elizabeth Mastrio and junior attacker Cara DiPeppo, who each have 17 goals on the season, Wiesse represents a dangerous offensive threat for Dartmouth.
Defensively, the Big Green is anchored by freshman goalkeeper Kiera Vrindten. Despite her rookie status, Vrindten has started seven of the season’s eight contests, although she did not play against Siena. The first-year’s average of 11 saves per game is the seventh-highest in the nation.
The New Jersey native also ranks in the top five in the Ivy League in saves, save percentage, and goals against, holding opponents to an average of 11.8 goals per game in conference play. But in spite of Vrindten’s best efforts, Dartmouth has begun the season 0-2 in the Ancient Eight, with a seven-point loss to Columbia followed by an 18-8 loss to Princeton.
Harvard, on the other hand, will look to extend its unbeaten streak in Ivy League play after 14-13 and 10-8 victories over Yale and Columbia, respectively.
“Dartmouth is typically a very scrappy team,” Hennessey said. “We want to be prepared to handle the high pressure they may throw at us, while also executing our game plan.”
In order to keep its undefeated Ancient Eight run alive, the Crimson will look to senior attacker Marisa Romeo, the team’s leading scorer, whose 30 goals put her at third place in the Ancient Eight.
This season alone, the Syracuse, N.Y. native has racked up seven hat tricks in nine games, in addition to garnering two Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week awards. The senior also made it onto the Tewaaraton Award watch list and ranks 13th in the country for goals per game.
McMahon, junior Julia Glynn and sophomore Keeley MacAfee have also been offensive weapons for Harvard this season. McMahon has contributed four assists and 17 goals so far, including two behind-the-back finishes in the last week. MacAfee is second on the team for goals with 22, while Glynn has chipped in 15 points this year on 12 scores and 3 assists. The trio will look to continue their strong attacking play this Saturday against Dartmouth.
Another player to watch for the Crimson is freshman defender Tate Green, whose strong defensive work has earned her playing time in all nine games this season.
The last time Harvard faced the Big Green was almost exactly a year ago, when the Crimson came away with a dominant 17-9 victory at Harvard Stadium. If their previous Ivy League matchups—which Harvard won by narrow one and two-point margins—are any indication, Saturday’s game may prove closer than the last.
“Ivy League games always bring out the best in you and your opponent, so it is always a battle,” Hennessey said. “We want to keep working hard in practice and beat all of our league opponents one game at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday and Sunday, Harvard softball (8-9, 0-0 Ivy League) is set to open Ivy League play on the road at Penn (9-8, 0-0 Ivy) and Columbia (7-13, 0-0 Ivy). The Crimson looks to bounce back from a 1-6 showing in Hawaii at the Rainbow Wahine Classic as it begins conference play.
“Our team has worked hard to show well for this Ivy season,” sophomore catcher Nicole Nishizawa said. “We aim to compete with confidence, poise, and grit.”
Last season, Harvard faced off against the Lions and Quakers in two doubleheaders. The Crimson emerged victorious against the two Ancient Eight teams in all four conference games, winning by a combined score of 33-15.
Standout players from the contests against Columbia and Penn include sophomore infielder Rhianna Rich, junior outfielder Maddy Kaplan, and sophomore outfielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer.
Currently, the three players leading the Harvard squad offensively are the very same individuals, Rich, Kaplan, and Schiffhauer, who have batting averages of .417, .368, and .357, respectively. Also strong at the plate, sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart has already racked up three home runs and 11 RBI after seeing limited action in her freshman year.
The pre-Ancient Eight season has been full of ups and downs for the Crimson. Harvard’s spring season opened on Feb. 24 at the EMU Madeira Beach Invitational. With both an opening and closing loss, the Crimson went 3-2 at the invitational. The pre-conference play continued at the Long Beach State/Fullerton Tournament in California where Harvard went 4-1 with its sole loss coming at the hands of San Diego State University.
At the next tournament, hosted by the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, the Crimson struggled to find its winning form throughout the week.
Harvard fell, 4-3, in a tight opening match on March 14 to the University of Connecticut. The Crimson was then defeated, 7-0, by the University of Hawaii, 3-2 by Marist College, and 8-3 by Purdue University in succession. Afterwards, Harvard claimed its sole victory on the week, 7-3, against the Boilermakers. The team then fell, 10-2, to the University of Hawaii. The Hawaii Invitational ended with a loss to University of Connecticut, 5-4.
Despite the team’s showing at the Hawaii Invitational, the players are confident and ready to bounce back from the bumps in their preseason.
“Our team respects all of our competition, but is also confident in our ability to perform,” Duncan said. “We have continued to work hard as a team, and so I am excited to see the results of our offseason throughout what we expect to be a very successful and competitive season.”
The Crimson’s offensive struggles so far this season have stemmed from a lack of big hits. The team’s slugging percentage through 17 games sits at .330. Out of its 116 total hits, only 22 have gone for extra bases.
Despite a relative lack of offensive firepower, Harvard has still outscored its opponents this season, 66-63. This trend can be attributed to the Crimson’s pitching staff, anchored by senior Taylor Cabe and sophomores Sarah Smith and Katie Duncan. Harvard has a team ERA of 3.26, good for second-best among Ivy League competitors.
The Crimson’s opponents this weekend are off to uneven starts to their seasons, as well. The Lions are currently 7-13 overall, but are faring well at home in New York, N.Y. where the team will be hosting Harvard. Columbia has swept its last two games at home, 9-1 and 5-1, in victories over Monmouth.
The Quakers are also set to be a challenging opponent coming off a two game winning streak against Rider University. Penn has a winning record overall, but thrives even more at home, where it is currently 5-2.
Ahead of Ivy League competition, the Quakers have proven to have a formidable pitching staff, as the squad boasts a 3.17 team ERA heading into this weekend’s games. Having pitched 21 innings of the season, junior Courtney Cuzick headlines the squad with  a team-leading 1.67 ERA.
Though Columbia is not as dominant in the circle as Penn, the Lions have a threatening lineup. Led by the Ivy League hits leader, junior shortstop Madison Gott, Columbia has accumulated 15 home runs so far on the season, while no other Ancient Eight team has hit more than eight.
“I’m really looking forward to getting out there and starting Ivy play,” junior outfielder Alexa Altchek said. “Everyone has worked so hard in preseason, so I’m excited to get out there and show what we can do in conference.”

No, we are not doing a self-evaluation. This time, we’re talking about FlyBy—the convenient (or unappetizing, depending on how you view it) lunch service for upperclassmen, located below Annenberg. This week, Flyby tackles the hard-hitting questions. How do Harvard students really feel about FlyBy? Here's what folks had to say:
“The location is good. The line is long sometimes.” - Jesse T. Zhang ’19
This one is pretty self-explanatory. Solid and succinct wording. We bet he does great with summary papers. Points for both.
“Soups are fantastic. Great Selection. If we could get some miso soup in there, that would be nice.” - William A. Bryk ’19
“I love it. I mean, they could have more food selections.” - Christian L. Bailey-Burke ’19
These sound just like the critiques your TF gives you. Starts nice and ends with things you could change for next time. These are better though because these critiques of FlyBy don’t end with you getting a C-. Points for both.
“It’s nice” - Yasmin Yacoby ’19
She was a first-time visitor and it’s the end of March. This either means that FlyBy has a really good first impression or that it should only be used in times of desperation. You decide.
“I really like that we’re able to access Queen’s Head. There’s a variety of seating.” - Ikeoluwa F. Adeyemi-Idowu ’19
“Good location. Annenberg versus just below.” - Julia E. Villasenor ‘19
Now these are some great points. Walk into Annenberg right after Ec10 lets out and good luck finding a seat. FlyBy is not so bad with overcrowding issues.
“I have no strong feelings.” - Jeongmin Lee ’19
Relatable. This statement is applicable to many things. 10/10 answer, but no points for either side.
There you have it. Team “Love It” (or don’t mind it) with the win! Apparently, FlyBy is the move for upperclassmen who don’t want to trek back to their house dining halls.

Freshman Formal is a night to remember. That being said, not everyone does. What’s the best way to get ready for that legendary night? Flyby is here to offer some tips, in the hopes that the Class of 2020 gets more out of it than we did.
Date or No?
Pros of having a date include having a date, possibly not paying for your ticket, and having someone to take endless pictures of you until you get an Insta-worthy one.
Cons of having a date include having a date, possibly paying for two tickets, and having to take endless pictures with someone you don’t know that well. Was this worth the saved $25? Ask yourself that when you realize you can’t crop your date out of the best picture that you took all night.
Awkward or Fun?
Freshman Formal will always and forever be awkward. You have your entire class dancing under a tent in the Science Center plaza while everyone pretends to tolerate the company of people outside their blocking group. You see everyone from everything you’ve ever done on campus. The girl who saw you pee on the statue? Check. The guy who walked past as you were on his Facebook profile in Annenberg? Check. Your drunken makeout(s) from Opening Days? Check, check and check. All that being said, awkward doesn’t mean boring. Anything can be fun if you pretend like it never happened the next day.
How much should I pre-game and when should I go?
Don’t pregame before dinner. Yakking in Annenberg while everyone is in cocktail attire is not the move. And paying $25 to not make it to the party is also not the move. And like every good Harvard student should know by now, the Yard is technically dry. Do what you will with that information.
Also, don’t show up right when the party starts because you will be disappointed unless you’re with a huge squad. Come at 10. 11 is also fine. But get there before 11:30 because, after that, no re-entry is allowed.
What should I wear?
All we can say is to watch the weather. Boston weather doesn’t know what it wants to be when it grows up, so it could very well be 10 degrees that night or 60. Hope for 60. Wear comfortable shoes and beware of wearing open-toe shoes because an army of stilettos will inevitably trample your feet and you will have bruises for weeks. And that is something that you will definitely remember.
