After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was no shortage of heat in North Carolina last weekend as temperatures reached the high eighties and the Crimson came in hot against the University of North Carolina Greensboro and North Carolina State. While the weather cooled off by the time they returned home to face Long Beach State on Thursday, Harvard did not, and has not since. The Crimson are now off to a 5-0 start for the first time since 1996.
“Going down to North Carolina, we knew we’d be tested,” said head coach Chris Hamblin, with the most obvious challenge being No. 17 NC State.
The Crimson dominated UNC Greensboro en route to a 4-0 win on Friday, September 2, before a stellar 2-0 performance to put away highly-anticipated NC State on their home turf. Following last weekend, Harvard reached No. 20/22 in the United Soccer Coaches and Top Drawer Soccer ranking polls, respectively, before their 2-0 win over Long Beach State.
“It was a good team win,” Hamblin said, referencing the NC State game. “For us to be able to start strong was really important to us, because belief is such a huge part of this process, and the team believed that they could play with anyone in the country, and we were able to show up and get the job done. I think we were the better team on the day and deserved the result.”
The Crimson (5-0-0, 0-0 Ivy League) entered Thursday’s contest prepared for a formidable matchup from Long Beach State (1-3-3, 0-0 Big West), with Hamblin pointing to LBSU's recent one-goal loss to No. 15/18 University of South California and their sensational, viral bicycle kick goal by senior forward Lena Silano in the 88th minute against the University of San Diego.
However, the Crimson quickly welcomed their opponent to Cambridge and silenced any bit of hype surrounding Long Beach State as sophomore midfielder Hannah Bebar struck early in the seventh minute on a cross from sophomore forward Ainsley Ahmadian to go up 1-0. Harvard went up and never looked back, with Bebar striking again in the 81st minute, this time assisted by senior forward Angela Caloia and senior midfielder Hannah Griffin, for some insurance on the 2-0 victory. Harvard dominated on both sides of the ball, with the defense holding LBSU to just four shots all game. Senior Crimson goalkeeper Hannah Gardner had two saves for the shutout.
In what was both expected to be and proved to be the most exciting and biggest game of the season to date, Harvard came out strong right out of the gate against the Wolfpack (4-1-1, 0-0 Atlantic Coast).
“I think overall, as a team [we] came out flying,” said Ahmadian.
In the 31st minute Ahmadian's shot found the back of the net off the cross from Bebar and the Crimson went up 1-0. Meanwhile, Harvard's defense put on a clinic, holding NC State to just six shots all game. Junior defender Taylor Fasnacht, junior defender Smith Hunter, senior defender Lara Schenk, and senior captain Jordan Di Verniero all logged more than eighty minutes, with Schenk and Hunter staying in all game, locking up NC State’s offense and squashing any hope of a comeback. Junior goalkeeper Anna Karpenko earned her first career shutout with two saves, and the Crimson limited the Wolfpack to zero corner kick opportunities, while they had ten.
“I think our defenders just came out with one of the best mentalities I’ve ever seen from them,” said Ahmadian.
Just five minutes into the second half, Ahmadian gave Harvard some cushion when she split the defense and fired a laser into the top right corner from over twenty-five yards out—which proceeded to sail easily past NC State goalkeeper Maria Echezarreta.
“One of the things we talked about before the game was just making sure that we’re paying attention to all the details, all the little pieces that add up to a good performance,” said Hamblin. “I think the team executed incredibly well on both sides of the ball...I was really proud of how they took the challenge on against a top-25 team and made a statement.”
Two days prior to the NC State matchup, the Crimson lit up the stat sheet against the Spartans (2-2-1, 0-0 Southern Conference) once they arrived in North Carolina. Goals from Ahmadian, first-year forward Audrey Francois, sophomore midfielder Nicola Golen, and junior midfiedler Megan Mackey highlighted the dominant win over UNC Greensboro. The defense held strong behind Schenk’s team-high 78 minutes and Gardner’s four saves for the shutout. Ahmadian and Francois received the Ivy League Player of the Week and Rookie of the Week awards, respectively, after their performances during the road trip.
Reflecting on the North Carolina trip, Ahmadian and Hamblin both acknowledged the team’s strong start but remained focused on the team’s future and continued improvement.
“I think for us, it’s about consistency. It’s focusing on who we are, what we’re trying to do, and improving our game rather than worrying about the opposition,” explained Hamblin. “I’m just really excited about the group and where we’re at, and we’ve had a strong start, but I think we’ve still got another gear we can find, and so we’re excited to try and work towards that.”
Harvard plays at home again this Sunday, hosting in-state rival University of Massachusetts Amherst (1-2-3, 0-0 Atlantic Ten) at 1:00pm, looking to continue the momentum and its undefeated start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2021 season for the Crimson (8-5-3) was one of best in recent history, and they show no sign of letting up in 2022. Two victories to begin the season over Central Connecticut State University and Bryant University foretell good things to come, with Harvard showing its ability to work under pressure early with a last-second go-ahead goal against the Bulldogs to win the game.
Harvard 2, Central Connecticut State 0
The Crimson opened the season against the Central Connecticut Blue Devils on Saturday, September 3rd. Harvard handily dealt with their opponents, shutting them out similarly to their 2021 matchup.
This was the third career shutout for senior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson, who made one save in the game. Other notable players included sophomore Alessandro Arlotti and junior Willem Ebbinge. Arlotti started the scoring off for the Crimson at 26:34 in the game; he is coming off a stellar rookie season in which he scored nine goals and was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year Ebbinge’s goal at 47:33 made the win all but assured, with Harvard riding out their lead for the win.
Several other Harvard players celebrated milestones in the match. Sophomore Kristjan Gunnarsson received his first college point with an assist on Arlotti’s goal, and sophomore Marko Isakovic earned his second collegiate point with an assist.
Harvard 2, Bryant 1
Crimson fans who braved the elements to watch their team play the Bryant Bulldogs were treated to a much tighter and more nerve-wracking contest on a rainy Tuesday night.
The game remained scoreless until the 50th minute when Ebbinge broke away off an assist from junior Nik White to put Harvard up 1-0. The Crimson rode this wave until the 80th minute, when a foul gave the Bulldogs a chance to equalize the game. Bryant junior Luis Fernando Paúl took a free kick from 15 yards out, nailing the top right of the net to tie the game 1-1.
Minutes later, Nilsson, Harvard’s goalkeeper, took a nasty fall and had to leave the game, though it was unclear whether Nilsson’s substitution was due to an injury or simply the rule against playing with blood on your jersey.
The Crimson subbed in senior goalkeeper David Paquette for the final six minutes, who had a strong performance in spite of the cold weather, and Bryant did not get another good look at the goal.
It appeared as though the game would end without further excitement until Arlotti was fouled in the box and was awarded a penalty kick. Lining up, he fired it at the net but was stopped by Bryant sophomore goalkeeper Luca Marinelli. Arlotti played the rebound well for a second chance at net, but a mammoth effort by Marinelli kept the Crimson at bay.
For the final six minutes, Harvard played fiercely, aggressively charging at their attacking end, trying to score one last goal. After a few weak looks at the net, Ebbinge played the ball into the box with less than a minute left, which was deflected away by a Bryant defender. However, first-year Marcos Ojea Quintana was able to keep the ball alive, sending it to senior Nico Garcia-Morillo, who scored the game winner off a left cross low with two seconds to spare.
The Crimson fans erupted, with the team charging to meet them at the fence, celebrating. The bench rushed to meet them, and the game for all intents and purposes, ended there.
These two games bode well for Harvard’s season, with several players already in good form. Ebbinge now has five points on the season with goals in two consecutive games. Arlotti is picking up right where he left off, and several Harvard defenders, including White, Gunnarsson, and sophomore Jan Riecke are seeing significant minutes.
The Crimson will be in action again on the road at Vermont on Saturday, Sept. 10th, 7:00pm.
