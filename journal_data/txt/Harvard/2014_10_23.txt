Playwright Neil Simon understands comedy. Through his cherished works—including “The Odd Couple” and “Brighton Beach Memoirs”—Simon shows his ability to write a myriad of jokes based on the human condition. “Laughter on the 23rd Floor,” playing at the Loeb Experimental Theater until Oct. 25, is no exception. In all, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club presents a winning production of Simon’s play thanks to the strong direction of Boyd I.R. Hampton ’16 and most notably, an impeccably cast, very talented group of actors.
Inspired by Simon’s experience working for the beloved 1950s variety program “Your Show of Shows,” “Laughter” follows the chaotic writers’ room of “The Max Prince Show” as the program steadily sinks into ratings oblivion. The harried, idiosyncratic comedians struggle to develop material that not only appeals to a growing, relatively unsophisticated Midwestern audience and NBC officials but also maintains the show’s signature edgy humor. Simon’s alter ego, novice writer Lucas Brickman (a very funny Thomas W. Peterson ’18), keeps running commentary on the perpetual fighting and zany shenanigans of his comparatively quirkier co-workers.
One of the play’s prevalent themes is “controlled chaos.” Hampton’s directorial choices are quite effective because he uses both the Loeb’s set (designed by Hampton and Daniel J. Prosky ’16) and lighting (designed by Kat C. Zhou ’17) to create a physical manifestation of this idea. The majority of the cast remains onstage throughout “Laughter,” which could have distracted from the action at hand. However, Hampton’s blocking choices focus attention on those directly speaking while still preserving the realism of writers mingling in the background, essentially organizing a disorganized writer’s room. In containing the chaos of the workroom, Hampton effectively conveys the hectic energy of “Laughter.” In addition, Zhou’s frequent use of a single spotlight to introduce a new character or simply advance the story is both stylish and effective; the stark light commands attention and is a nice contrast to the visually overwhelming main stage.
Hampton’s choice and use of set props bolsters the comedic appeal of “Laughter,” perfectly capturing the cluttered, madcap environment of a television writing room. Strewn about the Loeb’s intimate stage is a plethora of ragtag, incongruous props—onion rolls, a severed zombie head, and a pair of life-size, Daedelus-like wings, to name a few. Many of these odd props jokes within themselves, and the cast incorporates them into scenes as much as possible. Throughout the show, nearly every prop is thrown, flipped, worn, eaten, or destroyed, keeping the audience riveted and generating laughs.
More than anything, “Laughter” serves as a vehicle for the remarkably talented cast to display their comedic skills. It’s clear just how funny the performers are before the show even begins: the cast biographies and an ingenious list of acknowledgements (“Cheetah girls, Cheetah sisters,” “Rob Ford’s crack pipe”) are hilarious additions to the show. Once “Laughter” begins, each member of the relatively young cast (four of nine members are freshmen) absolutely delivers. Some highlights include Dylan J. Peterson ’17 as volatile falling star Max Prince, who deftly handles both dramatic and comedic scenes. His portrayal of a man watching his career steadily unravel is at once funny, tragic, and moving. Daniel S. Milaschewski ’17, playing oddball Milt Fields, possesses a rare, undeniable presence that makes it difficult to keep your eyes off him. His unprovoked, well-timed squeals never fail to throw the audience into a fit of laughter. And as the fidgety hypochondriac Ira Stone, Robert J. Hopkirk ’18 is a revelation. Whether launching into a manic tirade over his perceived brain tumor or scribbling his diagnosis across the wall in Sharpie, Hopkirk’s pure gusto and aplomb belies the fact that “Laughter” is his first HRDC show. Even though each actor is individually great, the cast comes together with a palpable, infectious camaraderie.
Of course, “Laughter” is not without its flaws. Occasionally, the jokes do fall flat, whether because of an accidental interruption between cast members, delivery of a line that’s just a bit too quick, or a one-liner that just doesn’t translate to a modern audience. However, the impressive trifecta of direction, props, and performances more than compensate for these brief lulls in energy. “Laughter” works so well because the actors adroitly avoid the pitfall of portraying their characters as two-dimensional, weak caricatures; rather, they manage to craft a group of real, flawed, very funny human beings. The show may not always bring the laughs, but it consistently brings the soul.

Dear George,
 I guess this means us spending the rest of our lives together is going to have to be postponed. I just hope it’s still within the next few years because we both know I’m going to be too old for you after that, my Fantastic Mr. (Silver) Fox. It’s just one of the Facts of Life. The tabloids announcing your wedding were crushing. They were definitely things I had to Burn After Reading. I forgave you for your first marriage only because it was over before I was born.  I had figured leaving things Up in the Air was the best decision, but I had underestimated the Gravity of your love for Amal.
I could cry an Ocean for you, and then another one...and yet another one. But at least I have your cinematic masterpieces to keep me company. You’re the exception to the rule that no sequel can ever compete with the original, and as long as there are Spy Kids marathons no one will forget that.
At the same time, I admire your step towards directing. It takes a real man to do what he loves despite the fact that he’d be making a shit-ton more money playing the roles out there that are readymade for him. Most admirably, you still make time for charity, though you failed to support mine (I have to admit “Marry me, George Clooney!” wasn’t too catchy a name for an organization). I imagined that One Fine Day you’d decide to fully endorse it. I had figured leaving things Up in the Air was the best decision, but I had underestimated the Gravity of your love for Amal.
        
 But I’m glad that you found a strong, independent woman who can handle herself and still vows to be there for you whenever you’re in need. Admittedly I wouldn’t have answered every call From Dusk ‘Til Dawn.
You may have been the Sexiest Man Alive twice, but I figure there’s a new edition each year. I wanted to be the one there to say Good Night, and Good Luck, but good riddance feels just as real.
Sincerely,
Hunter Richards
P.S. If you realize it was a mistake between now and turning in the marriage license, I’ll forget all about it. Call me! 269-680-2199 xoxo

Quote: “Clowns to killers. I choose not to play into any of it. The more attention we give it just gives it more fuel.” —Glenn Kohlberger, the president of Clowns of America International.
What to say to your friend who is afraid of clowns…
Don’t watch “American Horror Story.” Seriously. This clown is so terrifying that the Clowns of America International protested, claiming that the show perpetuates clown-phobia. However, viewers seem to relish the horror, and after its premiere on Oct. 8, the series has already been renewed for a fifth season, making fans excited for what murders and monsters are next.
What to say to your friend who is considering cancelling their cable…
Netflix has got you covered.  “Friends” just announced that it will be hopping on the Netflix bandwagon, joining other favorites like “How I Met Your Mother,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Breaking Bad,” and “New Girl.” All 10 seasons of the beloved comedy will be available in the U.S. and Canada on Jan. 1, 2015. Good luck getting any work done…
What to say to your friend who is an aspiring actress…
Well, can you hold your own against Emma Stone? The beloved actress is branching out from her start on the silver screen. Replacing Michelle Williams in the role of Sally Bowles, Stone will make her Broadway debut in the revival of “Cabaret” on Nov. 11.
What to say to a fan of “The Hunger Games”…
Patience is a virtue. The third installment in this saga isn’t due to premiere until Nov. 21. In the meantime, a new trailer has been released to quell the thirst of a yearlong wait. Featuring samples from the film’s soundtrack curated by Lorde, this trailer gives viewers a sneak-peek at the ruins of District 12 as seen through Katniss’s eyes.
What to say to your friend who misses the U.K. after their time abroad...
Just turn on your TV! Following in the footsteps of “Skins” and “The Office,” yet another hit British TV show has landed on the doorstep of America, ready to be remade. The “IT Crowd” ran for five seasons from 2006-2013 and won a BAFTA, an International Emmy, and a Golden Rose award. Can its U.S. remake live up to this legacy?
Around Campus
The publicity team for “Little Murders” deserves an award because this show has been inescapable these past few weeks. Originally premiering in 1967, “Little Murders” is a satirical riff on the American family. Also playing this week is “Laughter on the 23rd Floor,” which details the antics of a 1950s star and his ambitious staff. Both run until Oct. 25.
But if going to the theater is just not for you, drop by the Science Center on your way to class Oct. 23 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The “Harvard-MIT Research Expo: A Dialogue in Art” is transforming the lobby into a wonderland of origami, photography, poetry, biological artwork, and math sculptures.
While “IVY” may be taking its time in producing the long-awaited second episode, a new season from Ivory Tower titled “Absent” has sprung up on campus. Centered on a group of students who find themselves becoming invisible and unable to interact with society, this six-part series has just released its first trailer.

Exploring the Spotify profiles of your friends isn’t just useful when assembling a party playlist or discovering hidden gems in their “recently played” log. Spotify can also tell us a lot about how music is consumed today. It isn’t hard to find playlists built around a particular mood, event, or state of mind—some examples I’ve come across include “Calm Down,” “twerk.,” and “I Just Had Sex Party.” Although many treat the concept of theme-based listening as a novel one (there are even entire websites like Songza devoted to this kind of thing), the truth is that artists started packaging their music thematically, in the form of the album, long before these recent developments. The difference with albums lies in their nuance in communicating complex emotions and events while still telling a story.
A look at some of the highest-grossing albums of all time shows that the story is an important component that goes into not only emotionally complex musical works but also successful ones.
The Classics
“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” the Beatles hit considered by critics to be one of the first concept LPs in modern music, uses a fictional ensemble and their show as a framework for connecting a widely varied “set,” including “With a Little Help from My Friends,” “When I’m Sixty-Four” and the closing rhapsody, “A Day in the Life.” Beyond the faux-band motif, “Sgt. Pepper’s” songs are linked by the uniqueness of their instrumentation (including brass and woodwinds), the use of related musical keys, and lyricism that captures the mood of successful community-building and generational disconnect that defined the psychedelic era.
“Rumours” by Fleetwood Mac uses “the breakup” as its frame. No doubt influenced by the band’s own personal tensions unfolding in 1976, the album shows both the optimistic and pessimistic side of heartbreak with the equally energetic “Don’t Stop” and “Go Your Own Way.” The line of B-side track “Oh Daddy”—“And I can't walk away from you, baby/If I tried”—conveys the sentiments of regret and reversal that, while deviating from idea of a breakup, fits naturally into the emotional and thematic progression of the album.
Today’s Hits
Coldplay’s “Mylo Xyloto” uses color (physically on the album cover itself and musically in terms of the work’s expansive and more electronic sound) to show love’s triumph over suppression. While songs like the acoustic-grounded “Us Against the World” and the simplistic “Up in Flames” don’t fit in squarely with the rest of the album’s driving, full sound, they do help the listener to understand the vulnerabilities that inevitably come with a love story.
Kayne’s “Yeezus” uses lyrical and stylistic elements to weave together a hard-hitting work that tells a story of a world whose people are confused and adrift. West combines heavy religious (Jesus in “I Am a God”), historical (apartheid in “Blood On The Leaves,” and sexual (“Bound 2”) imagery with a straightforward sound composed mostly of basic beats and synthesizer lines, creating a picture of extravagance over a sensation of nothingness. These contrasting features, combined with the abrupt changes and samplings of high-pitched melodies (“On Sight”) and ceremonial chants (“I Am a God”), help to transmit Kayne’s message of confusion and discomfort to his listener.
The “stories” of these hit records have a wide range of topic and complexity. They are neither Broadway-esque in the obviousness of their plots nor one-dimensional in their themes as the playlists of today’s Spotify libraries tend to be. Some of the stories are told lyrically, while others are told musically with unified melodies, motives, and modes across different types of songs. Regardless of their methods, though, musicians who produce successful albums are able to create a work that not only displays diversity of talent or style but also uses that diversity to tell a story in the same way an author uses sentences, chapters, and literary devices to craft a novel. If we trust authors to order their chapters correctly and we take the time to read their stories from start to finish, we should trust musicians in their album-making ability and take the time to hear their stories, too. Just as literature has the power to convey complex ideas to its readers through its characters, albums have the potential to unlock a full range of human emotions that singles and Spotify playlists can only begin to uncover.

It’s unclear how exactly the countless generations of doe-eyed lovers before us announced their relationship statuses. Perhaps girls in poodle skirts and boys in letterman jackets burst into their friendly American burger joint with the frantic announcement, “We’re going steady!”
While the practice of formal dating, as emerged in the 1950’s, has dwindled significantly, especially on college campuses, the designation of a relationship as “Facebook official” among those remaining instances of formal dating has become even scarcer. In reality, the practice of signaling a relationship to the broader world comes from a long-rooted tradition, and has undeniable merits, from practicality to symbolic commitment. Bottom line: If you’re in a relationship, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be “Facebook official” too.
At first glance, there seems to be something superficial about the practice of displaying a relationship on social media. Shouldn’t matters of the heart be whispered in private, and at least for the hopeless romantics among us, contained in the realm of moonlight and poetry?
Actually, no. The emergence of the term itself indicates that love has a practical and social component to it. Like it or not, lovers who dare face the light of day will have to situate their relationship within a broader social context. Because love inherently has an element of possessive exclusivity, handling the broader social context is inevitable. For example, you need people to know that however attractive your significant other may appear, he or she is firmly off limits to any potential seducers/seductresses.
This practical function is akin to the class rings that teenagers in the 1950’s would exchange, or to the cheerleader captain wearing the football captain’s letterman jacket to the sock hop. It may have evolved an ostentatious component to it, but it originated from a practical need to simply mark one’s own.
Of course, these arguments may still fall on deaf ears for hopeless romantics who believe simply in love—and not in “labels.” It’s undeniable that “Facebook official” is a much less poetic way of broadcasting commitment to social networks than a public declaration of love into a mic at a crowded party, romantic-comedy style. Yet Facebook pages are the first places we check when we meet someone new; our Facebook personas are, for better or for worse, undeniably important to our IRL lives. Translating real-life relationships to Facebook not only makes life easier but also has become in our modern context the new way of showing symbolic commitment.
The fear that it would make things awkward if you break up is a legitimate concern. The commiserating comments that accompany the “So-and-so is single” listing on any newsfeed can sometimes add salt to an already sore wound. However, it seems strangely morbid to enter a relationship assuming its demise, especially when the consequences are simply people knowing of its demise. Break-ups come with far greater emotional losses than the public awareness of its occurrence.
So here’s my call to all the happily dating people at Harvard that I know exist, despite the plethora of Internet articles bemoaning the fall of dating on college campuses: celebrate it. Post it on Facebook. Celebrate the hopeful feeling of new love amidst the crisp Cambridge autumn, without worrying about what could hypothetically happen at the end.
And of course, there’s no harm in watching the ‘likes’ accumulate.

Sometimes when I look at mine and my friend’s Google Calendars, I wonder if what I am seeing is real. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., there are blocks for showering and eating both in blue, a few classes in green, maybe a nap in yellow. From three onward, the fun begins: there are meetings for extracurricular activities in red, a space for working out in yellow, a time for dinner with a friend in red, and a few hours of homework in green. Most days have little to no white space in them. There are even days when I have scheduled my sleep in a bright yellow box, a sign that I possibly do not trust myself to stop working if I do not remind myself I need to. I love my work. I love my extracurricular activities. Above all, I love my friends. And yet, I still ask myself, “Why do I make myself so ridiculously busy?”
Though I am not sure that I know the answer for myself, let alone my peers, I feel like our constant state of busyness relates to our pursuit of excellence. A belief that percolates through campus that it’s not enough for us to do a lot or to do what we do well. Instead, we must do a lot well. Furthermore, and maybe most importantly, I know I sometimes think I need to make it look like everything I do is effortless, as if functioning on minimal sleep, having hundreds of pages of reading, and three meetings does not overwhelm me in any way.
The moment that most captures this pressure I, and I imagine others, feel is the “catch-up” lunch with a friend. I always feel compelled to simultaneously brag and dismiss all that is packed into my schedule. My extracurricular activities aren’t that time consuming. My course work isn’t that hard or that much. I am finding a way to work out but not quite as much as I’d like. And don’t worry, I tell my friend, I am still socializing. My friend and I always seem to discuss everything we have fit into our calendars. Somehow though, the only mention of how either of us is actually doing is, “I’m doing okay, just stressed.”
Despite working myself to the brink and dismissing the difficulty of my efforts, when I consider my favorite moments at Harvard thus far, they all occurred in the random, uncommon white space on my calendar. There was the time when I stayed up until 5 a.m. eating JP Licks ice cream cake with my roommates. Another favorite was when I went to a Red Sox game on a whim, despite that I had made plans for the evening. When the Red Sox won the World Series the night before my Gov 20 midterm, I ran around the Yard screaming, “Let’s go Red Sox! Let’s go Red Sox!” I can still feel the adrenaline from that night. There were also the numerous meals in Annenberg during reading period that stretched on for hours and the random Boba Tea dates so that I could give advice to friends or they could give it to me.
These moments spurred me to work harder in my classes and allowed me to relax enough that I enjoyed my extracurricular activities and my time with others that much more. They made me feel like I was maturing here at Harvard and making the friendships that would last me a lifetime, not just challenging my intellectual, social, and time-management skills. They also just made me feel like a kid who could say, “I don’t have it all figured out, and I definitely can’t do it all.”
I still constantly need to remind myself of the importance of those moments. I find myself teetering on the edge between striving for effortless perfection, the term coined at Duke in 2003 that defines students’ feeling that they must be “smart, accomplished, fit, attractive, and popular” without appearing to try, and embracing effortful imperfection, an idea that Williams student Allegra Hyde discusses in her article “Effortful Imperfection.” Hyde states that it is important not to believe that “failure is imminent” and that we all have days when we cannot do it all. Maybe I am completely crazy for accepting less than my best and most polished at times. But if sacrificing the pursuit of perfection means I can further pursue happiness by committing extra time to my friends, my family, and my own health, I will accept that trade.
While I do not know the answers to this quandary, I have a feeling that the best way to begin accepting effortful imperfection is leaving a little more white space on my calendar and seeing where it takes me. I hope some of my peers will join me. We might find that less is actually more and that we will be a little less stressed, a little bit happier, and, ironically, a little more successful.

Recently, Cornell announced the launch of a $150 million “Engaged Cornell” initiative to increase public service on campus by mandating that undergraduates take at least one course engaged in public service as a requirement for graduation. By contrast, Harvard administrators have come out against the idea of similarly requiring Harvard students to engage in service.
While we recognize the importance of public service, we support the FAS Committee’s stand against mandating public service. Requiring such activities is not the best way to foster in students a love and appreciation for service to their community. People need to take their own initiative, to get involved because they believe it is important and meaningful. Harvard is lucky in that it is in an urban area that already offers much opportunity for involvement throughout Boston and Cambridge. Moreover, there are already robust programs such as the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Institute of Politics that both work to provide many remarkable service opportunities for students.
At the same time, the Harvard administration should embrace Cornell’s innovative approach of the integration of service into academic pursuits, and should offer more courses with this structure and mindset. Many public service-minded students look for ways to integrate their work outside the classroom with their academic pursuits. Additionally, there are students who wish to study public policy and pursue careers in public service, who would greatly benefit from more academic opportunities. These efforts should work to enhance current public service programs by contributing a focus on understanding the values and issues that impact the service arena.
Harvard should also considering adding Opening Days sessions that would discuss the importance of public service and the various factors that go into such endeavors. If Harvard wishes to instill in students an appreciation for public service, it should do so when students are most open to new ideas and are already learning about Harvard’s view on the world. Past this point, Harvard should allow students to pave their own paths and embrace the endeavors about which they are most passionate. At the end of the day, Harvard is a liberal arts academic institution, and its course requirements should reflect this desire to expand students’ intellectual opportunities without unnecessarily restraining or shaping their academic passions.

UPDATED: October 24, 2014, at 1:26 a.m.
Sitting in Annenberg with my morning coffee, about to read The Crimson cover to cover (as all Harvard students do), I caught sight of an op-ed calling on students to avoid using the “R-Word.” I concur. But I want to take it one step further.
Over the past month, I’ve been asked to introduce myself by way of my given name, dorm, and hometown. I’ve also been asked to share the significance of my name, my ice cream of choice, my spirit animal, and my favorite word. For your information, my name is Leni (it was my grandmother’s nickname), I live in Grays, I’m from the DC area, I enjoy a tub or two of mint Oreo ice cream when I’m feeling down (or up for that matter), I identify with lions, and last but definitely not least my favorite word is “fucktard.” In fact, I have an affinity for all curse words.
I’m the youngest in a big family. I learned growing up that the later I managed to stay up, the more “bad words” I’d hear. To be fair, in my family, the not-so-nice synonym for fecal matter and the word that sounds like what beavers build aren’t considered all that bad. I was never told to put a nickel in the swear jar or go to my room for using the full breadth of my extensive vocabulary.
Still, I felt my parents expected me to reserve the use of particular naughty words for special occasions. I didn’t tell my brother to “go eff himself” when he left a mess in the bathroom—a misdemeanor of that sort didn’t warrant that particular linguistic flourish. No, I reserved so special a phrase for when he left a mess in the bathroom, and no hot water in the pipes. My parents understood the gravity of a situation such as having to take a cold shower and never said anything more than “stop shouting” if they overheard my brother and me exchange a few filthy words outside our bathroom door.
Here at Harvard, however, where so many of us are away from home for the first time, some people are taking far too much advantage of being out from their parents’ watchful eye and prying ear. They eat frosted flakes for lunch, stay up way too late, and swear like sailors.
The words don’t offend me, but they’re beginning to bore me. Did the person I ran into at Hillel who didn’t realize I was Jewish really need to ask, “What the f(iretr)uck are you doing here?” Wouldn’t “What are you doing here?” have sufficed? (I mean, it’s Harvard, and my last name is Hirsch; the F may have been warranted if we ran into each other at Catholic mass… but a Hillel lunch?) Similarly, does the kid in my entryway really not give a damn about who won the latest UC election, or does he just not care?
The distinction is important to me because I fear these special words in our language don’t pack enough of a punch anymore; they’re losing their shock value—which is actually their total value. Our prolific use of dirty language makes us seem coarse and jaded at best, and uncreative in our ability to express ourselves at worst. The vast majority of the time, we could find a better way to express a sentiment. So why not opt to save those special words for when they’ll actually make an impact?
And isn’t there something nice about having a body of words that isn’t for frequent, public use? Do you really want the words to become so commonplace that someone comes in for an interview thirty years from now and drops the F-bomb as if it’s nothing? There’s worth in having words that are meant to be used with a knowing tone between you and your best friends over a glass of whiskey or game of cards, or to use with your enemy so they know just how much you despise them.
So, I’m seconding the op-ed’s call for Harvard students to use a different word in place of the R-Word. But I’m also calling for us to consider our choice of language more broadly, especially when it comes to my favorite words. Not only will a reduction of usage in these words make every day conversation more civil, but it will also make the not so everyday conversation that much more meaningful.

Larry Summers is, by most accounts, a pretty hard guy to please.
Students in his courses on globalization and American economic policy quickly see that they’re not in for a dose of Harvard’s famous grade inflation. If they ask about their mark, Summers might well tell them they would’ve earned a higher one if he graded like most of his colleagues.
Soon after Summers was picked as Harvard’s next president in 2001, faculty members realized they were in for a similar wake-up call. In his inaugural address, the new president declared that Harvard needed to reexamine its undergraduate curriculum and that professors needed to interact more with students, putting the Faculty on notice in the most public of ways.
Summers’s allies say he has high standards, is fiercely loyal, and is always laser-focused on solving the problem at hand. His opponents say he has a limited understanding of empathy, holds his friends to a lower bar, and does not know how to admit mistakes.
What few deny is that Summers is a master teacher: Socratic, probing, intellectually hungry. For all of this, his students swear by him. Summers brought these same traits to the Harvard presidency, challenging professors about their research and teaching and sparring with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. At a university built on tradition, it was a change of pace.
Reactions were mixed, to say the least: Summers lasted just five years, leaving the presidency in 2006 after being rejected, in no uncertain terms, by many in the Faculty. And yet today, after a year on sabbatical, two years at the White House, and months of speculation in 2013 that he would move to the top post at the Federal Reserve, he’s settled back into teaching, a role that has shaped his Harvard career more than any other.
******
Larry Summers, who turns 60 next month, has had a lot of careers. Today, he calls himself a teacher.
It’s an interesting label for someone who is Harvard’s president emeritus, who has worked as a managing director at a top New York City hedge fund, served as U.S. Treasury Secretary, and most recently spent two years as one of President Barack Obama’s top economic and domestic policy advisers. But Summers, in one-on-one interviews as well as public lectures, sticks to it.
It’s a label, and a way of thinking and working, that’s informed much of his life, from Economics 10 office hours in the late 1970s to the meetings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences he chaired as president and the tremendous chasm in between. It’s a label that’s guided him, again and again, back to Harvard.
Nowadays, Summers holds court at the Kennedy School of Government in a second floor area that lacks the grandeur of his old corner office in Massachusetts Hall. The office is also entirely more accessible than his old digs, situated as it is just above the HKS dining hall and just off a major student walkway. Students who look should have no problem finding Summers, and that’s how he likes it. 
Summers’s area—it’s actually two offices and a waiting room—is everything you might expect. The former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury Secretary—now he’s “Professor Summers”or, more often, just “Larry”—has a staff of three who cue up phone calls, keep his packed schedule, and usher students in and out, often at least 15 minutes behind schedule.
The most spacious room in the mini-compound is Summers’s office, decorated head-to-toe with Harvard paraphernalia and a touch of U.S. financial and political history. Not five feet away is a space for Summers’s budding protégés, a collection of desks in an adjacent room where these students set up shop. Whether he’s on the phone or in a meeting, the system allows Summers to keep many of his best friends, as his former students often become, close. 
Natasha R. Sarin, a third-year Harvard graduate student pursuing a law degree and a Ph.D. in Economics, is one protégé who makes the trek to Summers’s office frequently. Last year, as a second-year graduate student, Sarin worked out of the office five days a week. This year she’s busier, but she still stops by at least twice a week.
“There are days when we spend like three hours together,” Sarin told me one day this September, her notebooks spread out on one of the office’s spare desks. “Larry’s a really busy guy, he’s meeting a lot of important people...but he makes time.”
On this particular Tuesday an economics midterm is atop the agenda. Sarin’s a top student: On a year off from Yale in 2011, she worked at the National Economic Council, where she met Summers, at the time the NEC’s director. Sarin soon came to Harvard and quickly began working with Summers again, both on research and as a teaching fellow in his globalization courses.
But today, Sarin isn’t sure she’s got a handle on this exam.
“I’m having some trouble with verbal problems,” she says, thumbing through a wrinkled packet of midterm review questions.
Summers—legs crossed, torso angled towards Sarin in a favorite pose—doesn’t miss a beat. “Give me a verbal problem,” he says, motioning for the review questions. “Let’s do a verbal problem.”
As Summers reads the first question on the page, his speech slows just a bit. By the time he’s finished the prompt he’s got the answer in his head, but instead of blurting it out—instead of signaling his renowned quickness—he pauses. It’s not long before he’s launched into his slow, deliberate way of teaching by asking. As the questions build—“what happens to the meat prices here, if carrot prices go up?”—Sarin starts to nod.
“Yeah,” she says after a few minutes of the asking drill. “Yeah, I’ve got it.”
Summers smiles, and it’s a real smile, not one of the contrived grins that the oft-photographed—Summers included—are occasionally guilty of. He’s made it apparent time and again that he likes being right, but he also clearly enjoys this mentorship role, showing somebody the answer rather than telling them.
It’s a Socratic skill that Summers has been honing for years, ever since his first time at the blackboard as an Ec. 10 teaching fellow in 1976. Way back then, with his characteristic untucked shirt and collection of crumpled notes, Summers earned a reputation as a bit “scatterbrained,” but also as utterly brilliant and especially dedicated. After class, you could always find him in Lowell House, either in his tutor suite—a mess of papers and pizza boxes—or in the dining hall, where he sat for hours working with students.
Today, while Summers’s office is far cleaner, his teaching philosophy is much the same. Proudly included on a curriculum vitae that runs 4,500 words is a flashback: “Outstanding Teaching Fellow in Introductory Economics, Harvard University, 1977.”
“Obviously I don’t hang out in dining halls the same way that I did when I was a tutor in my early 20s,” Summers told me this fall. “But to this day I get a lot of satisfaction out of, at any moment, being able to mentor a certain number of students.”
*****
That 1976 Ec. 10 section has never strayed very far from Larry Summers’s mind. Even when he left Harvard in 1991—first for the World Bank and eventually for escalating posts at the Treasury Department—he tried to keep debates and conversations no more formal than they were in section, back when he didn’t wear a suit and was barely older than the students he taught.
“It was very much a Socratic process of people working with each other,” remembered Robert E. Rubin ’60, a close Summers friend and his predecessor as U.S. Treasury Secretary. 
“It didn't matter whether you were the most senior person in the room or the most junior person in the room, what you said mattered,” Rubin added, largely crediting Summers with encouraging an atmosphere where prerogative took a back seat.
If the atmosphere was collegial, it certainly wasn’t perfect. Missteps during Summers’s Washington tenure—most notably a poor-taste memo from his World Bank days—would eventually become fodder for his opponents at Harvard and elsewhere.
Still, Harvard came calling in 2001, looking for its next president and asking Summers to interview for the job.
“There was interest in talking to me, and I thought, ‘This would be a hugely exciting opportunity.’ That it would be something to pursue,” Summers told me last month, sparing both of us the “I never thought I would be selected” cliché that we both know isn’t quite true.
This isn’t to say, of course, that Summers was always the frontrunner. He wasn’t, at least in the ever-speculating eyes of the media, which coalesced in declaring then-University of Michigan President Lee C. Bollinger—now the president of Columbia University—as the obvious pick. But as the field narrowed from 400 to 40 to three, Summers made the cut each time. At a final interview, Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Robert G. Stone '45-'47 pulled Summers aside and draped his arm around him for one last chat.
Summers left the meeting feeling good about his chances, and a few days later he was told he had the job if he wanted it. Accepting the Harvard presidency meant moving from Maryland to the ceremonial Elmwood residence—a Harvard-owned house that sacrifices privacy for ceremony and can be revoked on short notice—and making a long-term commitment to Harvard.
Summers said yes. At a triumphant press conference in March of 2001, he let his excitement, and his expectations, shine through.
“It’s good to be home. I accept,” he told the gaggle gathered in Loeb House, with another real smile. “I expect to be here quite a while.”
*****
Back in his days as a graduate teaching fellow and then as a young associate professor, Larry Summers had a reputation for rushing into class—maybe a few minutes late—and rather abruptly starting his lecture.
The tardiness followed him to Mass. Hall, but so did the urgency. When he took office in the fall of 2001, Summers got started quickly, jumping in headfirst with a pointed inauguration speech. His primary focus was the undergraduate experience.
“First, we will need in the years ahead to ensure that teaching and learning are everything they can be here, especially at the very heart of the University—Harvard College,” the new president said. “What is most crucial is this: Whether in the classroom or the common room, the library or the laboratory, we will assure more of what lies at the heart of the educational experience—direct contact between teacher and student.” 
The statements made sense. But from a new president on one of the University’s most historic days, they were also a very public challenge to the hundreds of faculty in attendance, particularly as they suggested a new central authority—Summers—at an institution which had for centuries thrived on decentralization. Nevertheless, many Harvard faculty—even those who would eventually clash with Summers—remember being inspired themselves by the speech.
The underlying premise, though, was that Harvard’s faculty members needed to change the way they were doing their jobs. This central Summers thesis—reduced in at least one subsequent speech to “The College in the center of the University. It is excellent. It can be better”—soon became a flashpoint between the new president and the University’s oldest de facto governing body: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Summers’s style only accentuated this point of tension. Faculty members soon found out that Larry Summers didn’t run meetings the same way his predecessor Neil L. Rudenstine did. While Rudenstine was soft-spoken and respected decorum, Summers was loud, asked a lot of questions, and wasn’t afraid to call you or your idea “stupid.”
“He would take positions that he knew were wrong, just to have a debate,” remembered Benedict H. Gross ’71, who served as the dean of Harvard College under Summers. “Some people just didn’t go for that stuff.”
Summers’s inclination to be provocative was an extension of his work as a teacher and a researcher, a manifestation of the sort of mind that had won top economics prizes by challenging common assumptions and had pushed eager students to new heights. But this approach, some suggest, led Summers to treat his presidency more like an intellectual debate—where feelings ought to be checked at the door—than was appropriate.
Some appreciated the debate.
“He was always pushing hard for whatever it was he wanted to have happen,” University President Drew G. Faust, who served as dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study under Summers, said in an interview this month. “And he had a drive and impatience that was motivating and grabbed your attention and mobilized people.”
Stephen J. Greenblatt, a University Professor—Harvard’s top teaching appointment, which comes with license to teach any course in any department—found Summers’s style jarring at first, but also appreciated the intellectual spirit of the challenges.
“He is not someone who is reluctant to question people,” Greenblatt said this fall. “He expressed questions and doubts that I found sort of bracing, [but] it wasn’t annoying, it felt...exciting...I found it actually attractive.”
Others, like Cornel R. West ’74, were not as receptive. West, also a University Professor and the chair of Harvard’s growing African and African American Studies Department, was summoned to Summers’s Mass. Hall office in Oct. 2001.
The meeting was a debacle. West afterward claimed that Summers gestured to West’s spoken word album, referred to it as a rap CD and an “embarassment” to Harvard, and challenged West about his teaching. University Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., a close colleague of Westin the African and African American Studies department—a unit with which Summers clashed early on—remembers the meeting as a “disaster, with two people who were both very smart, equally smart, with humongous egos, talking past each other.” 
Summers has declined to comment in detail on what he insists was a private conversation.
“In retrospect, I wish that I had insisted on being present at that meeting to mediate between them,” Gates said this month. “Cornel is a very brilliant and refined thinker and was most certainly not used to being spoken to in the way in which Larry spoke to him.”
Coming as early as it did in Summers’s tenure, the affair signaled that a new leadership strategy generated divided reactions: while some found it refreshing, some thought it downright disrespectful and accused Summers of inappropriately meddling with the work of tenured faculty. West was in the latter camp. Less than 24 hours after the meeting, according to Gates, West had accepted an offer from Princeton. He was gone by the fall of 2002.
Gates, who said he enjoyed “verbal jousting” with Summers and didn’t mind the challenges, nevertheless recalled a paradigm shift.
“The styles embodied by Neil Rudenstine and Larry Summers couldn’t have been more diametrically opposed. It was night and day,” Gates said. “Most people want the president to remember their name...and say ‘I like that book you just published.’ And if you don’t get that kind of positive reinforcement, it’s quite disconcerting to most people, even professors at Harvard.”
*****
Today, Summers likes to be perfectly, 100 percent clear about ground rules. Reporters, even familiar faces, are greeted at the start of every interview with a firm discussion about how the conversation will be treated. Summers, it turns out, knows the ethics better than many journalists; he knows he can’t go off the record unless the reporter agrees, and he certainly knows to be explicit that off the record really means off the record and that his statements won’t become newsroom gossip.
The diligence, to anyone who knows Summers’s story, makes a lot of sense.
In early 2005, Summers’s presidency was moving full steam ahead. Since the Cornel West affair he had largely continued his practice of challenging everyone from undergraduates in his freshman seminars to potential new hires to University professors on their thinking, teaching, and research. At the same time, Summers raised funds for the University at record levels, markedly increased financial aid across the University, and worked on a master plan for a new Allston campus. 
He had also made progress on perhaps his biggest project: the Harvard College Curricular Review. Though he stepped back from leading the review before it concluded, the process eventually generated the Program in General Education and pushed back the concentration declaration deadline, among other changes.
Summers had sought to effect culture change at Harvard, and particularly at the College, to make life revolve more around teaching and learning. And in a 2005 speech to the Harvard Club of Washington, D.C., he proudly declared that progress had been made.
“You know, when I was recruited to be a professor at Harvard in 1983, no one to my knowledge asked me for a single bit of evidence on whether I had or had not been an effective teacher at MIT, where I was then,” Summers told the crowd. “Today, no one becomes a member of the senior faculty at Harvard without a careful review of their record as a teacher and as a mentor of students.”
Summers was on a roll, confidently ticking off many of his top priorities. But this momentum hit a roadblock in January, 2005, when he removed his presidential cap for a seminar at the National Bureau of Economic Research—an old haunt for Summers and many Harvard economists. The seminar was titled “Diversifying the Science and Engineering Workforce.”
Summers made it clear that he was attending the event as an economist and not as Harvard’s president or to discuss University efforts to promote diversity. The seminar was to be off the record, and the event organizer said that he had invited Summers “to come and be provocative.”
Provocative Summers was. Between statements like “I’ve given you my guesses...they may be all wrong” Summers posited that women may be underrepresented in the sciences due to family constraints—not a new hypothesis—but also because of “issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude.”
Within 48 hours, an interpretation of the remarks had hit the national media.
Summers had walked in to what he thought would be a collegial, off-the-record, classroom-type atmosphere. It was supposed to be exactly the type of arena in which he thrived, bouncing ideas off the participants with his trademark dose of provocation. Instead, two days later, he saw himself branded a sexist by some.
The remarks awoke a sleeping giant in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As discontent brewed and boiled, the February meeting of the FAS came and went. Multiple pockets of opposition existed, according to faculty members, but none was yet organized enough to mount a formal challenge to the president.
The lapse was temporary. In preparation for the March FAS meeting, J. Lorand Matory ’82, a professor of African and African American Studies and a leader of the Summers opposition, docketed a vote on the following motion: “the Faculty lacks confidence in the leadership of Lawrence H. Summers.”
Matory saw the vote as a public voice of opposition more than anything else. He did not expect it to pass.
“I was certainly hoping [it would pass], but I did not assume that it would be so,” he said last week. “If 20 percent of the FAS approved the measure, as I hoped, I would see no reason for that to be a cause for his leaving office...I wanted things to be clear, and I wanted that opinion to be here.”
Once docketed, however, the motion inspired an upheaval of anti-Summers sentiment. At least 550 faculty members—roughly five times the usual turnout for meetings of the FAS—attended the March meeting. The event had to be moved from University Hall to the Loeb Drama Center, where Summers and other top administrators sat among scenery for a production of Christopher Marlowe’s “Dido, Queen of Carthage.”
The atmosphere was unprecedented. Summers, who as president usually ran the FAS meetings, asked FAS Dean William F. Kirby to take over.
Gross, then the dean of the College and now a close friend of Summers, remembered a chaotic evening.
“Dean Kirby was trying to run the meeting very civilly, and he was saying, ‘Now, before we vote, let’s make time to discuss this,’ and people were standing up and yelling, ‘I object! We have to vote now!’” he said.
The tempers were an ominous sign. The vote, conducted by secret ballot, went against Summers in a development that shocked many: 218 in favor of the motion, 185 against, 18 in abstention.
*****
The vote stung.
Summers, at first, took the news coolly. But then his hand covered his mouth and, as he realized the magnitude of the announcement, his expression dropped off.
Those who were in attendance remember a certain cruelty of the affair. There he was, the president of Harvard—a graduate of Harvard—being told in front of many of his friends, with the national media just outside, that he had gone about things all wrong.
As he left, Summers didn’t duck the media. He said he hoped to heal the wounds. He said he would learn from his mistakes. He tried to smile, but photos caught him looking low, dead straight ahead, clutching prepared remarks in one hand and making his way, under police escort, away from the Loeb. 
Gross remembered a lack of civility.
“It was really high tempers,” he said. “I’ve never seen faculty meetings like that.”
Summers, his friends say, felt attacked by a Faculty that by the end was looking for any opportunity to express its discontent. Shortly after the no-confidence vote he stepped back from the review of the undergraduate curriculum under heavy pressure from the Faculty. The review had been one of his his closest pet projects.
After a summer and fall full of peacemaking efforts, Summers hit another roadblock in Feb. 2006, when he tried to distance himself from his close friend Andrei Shleifer ’82, the disgraced economist whose criminal activities led to Harvard’s paying a $26.5 million settlement in 2005. When asked to comment on the Shleifer Affair in a Feb. 2006 faculty meeting, Summers—who had recused himself from Harvard’s handling of the matter—said he didn’t know enough of the facts to give an informed response.
The answer didn’t satisfy many in the Faculty. Matory, making the case against Summers, called the response “nothing short of disgusting.”
For many, the Shleifer affair was the final straw. After the Harvard Corporation lost confidence in him, Summers resigned in Feb. 2006.
“Difficult marriages sometimes end and so it is with ours,” he told the Faculty at his last FAS meeting.
Summers doesn’t enjoy speaking about the end of his presidency. He’d much rather tackle a student’s problem set or break down three top trends in the American economy. But in an interview this fall, he looked back to his tenure.
“I was in a hurry because I saw much that was urgent,” he said. “I didn’t think a 30-year-old curriculum or the lack of personal contact between faculty and students at Harvard College or the quality of student experiences was acceptable for the world’s leading university. I saw incredible potential for Harvard to respond to the growing equality of opportunity challenge in the United States, to lead the world in the life sciences and their applications, and to contribute to solving so many global challenges. I am proud of the progress the University made in all these areas during my presidency.”
Summers continued, addressing the contention surrounding his exit and his rift with many in the Faculty.
“Would I prefer that it had happened in a way where people were more comfortable and there was less controversy? Of course. We’re all works in progress and I’ve learned from my mistakes,” he said with a pause. “I have always believed that complacency is the greatest danger for great institutions, so I don’t regret my core decision to challenge prerogatives and push for change even at the expense of comfort and tradition.”
*****
When Summers left the presidency in June 2006, he could have gone just about anywhere.
He could have gone back to Washington, to a think tank or the like to lay in wait for what was likely to be an incoming Democratic administration. He could have gone to almost any university in the world.
And he did leave, if only for a time, packing up with his wife, English professor Elisa New, and spending the better part of a year with their children from previous marriages.
“We had a lot of kids, and we were actually very concerned at that point with beginning to blend these families and so it was kind of exciting, and when Larry decided to resign, I thought, ‘Okay good, we can live in Brookline,’” New remembered earlier this month during an interview at the couple’s Brookline home. 
“There were a ton of positives,” Summers added. He was firm all along that the year off was a sabbatical, not an exit strategy. He even bragged to graduating seniors in 2006 that he, unlike them, would keep his library privileges.
And, soon enough, New and Summers came straight back to Harvard. New settled back into the English Department, where she had once been the director of undergraduate studies, and Summers picked an office at the Kennedy School as the newly minted Charles Eliot University Professor.
“We’re both teachers,” New said this month. “There wasn’t much question [about returning to Harvard.]”
For Summers, it was in many ways a return to the scene of many of his hardest moments. As he unpacked in his new office at HKS, incoming president Faust moved into his old one in Mass. Hall.
Faust kept much of the furniture in the office where it was, and though she didn’t mention her predecessor much by name, in her early remarks she highlighted many of his hardest-fought accomplishments.
“We are on the verge of a new College curriculum that has already deeply engaged the Faculty and that promises more coherence, more choice, and more excitement in undergraduate education,” she said shortly after she was selected, ticking off primary tenets of Summers’s curricular crusade. “We have just received a faculty report calling for renewed and enhanced dedication to teaching. A new advising system has been launched.”
And, at today’s Harvard, Summers has found a niche—a large one given that he, as a University Professor, can teach in any department and at any school.
“I like to be based in a university, and Harvard’s the university because of its breadth that has always seemed most appealing to me,” he said last week.
But it’s clear that the connection goes deeper. Though he graduated from MIT— “a small technical institute located down Massachusetts Avenue,” as he often called it—Summers blossomed while teaching Ec. 10, Ec. 1410 (public sector economics), and working with graduate students. In 1983, when he had a chance for tenure at MIT, he returned to Harvard instead. In 2011, when he had a choice of retaining an ongoing appointment as an adviser to President Obama or holding on to his tenure—a distinction which expires after two years of inactivity—Summers chose Harvard once again.
To be sure, it’s not as if Larry Summers has lost his national and international focus: Last year, he was nearly tapped by Obama to lead the Federal Reserve, a position he clearly intended to accept, before senators strongly cautioned against his nomination. Now, he writes a monthly column for the Financial Times where he explores everything from hardcore economic theory to the political movements he’s had to master as a domestic policy adviser. It is not atypical for him to visit, in the course of one week, airports Logan, LaGuardia, and Reagan.
The trips are frequent and the weeks are long—“I’m outta here,” Summers said, slightly exasperated, around 2:30 p.m. on a Friday this fall after a rare short day. Campus days are packed with writing, student visits, and course plans, which Summers saturates with tidbits from his travels and, always, a story or two from his Treasury and World Bank days.
“I like to think that my activities outside the University are helpful for students because it enables me to provide them with connections and advice for the vast majority who are looking to pursue non-academic careers,” Summers told me this month. He added that the lectures and office hours are often highlights on his schedule.
“The aspect of my job that I love most is that I feel that I am able to be very close both to world of public policy and to the world of thought,” he told me. “I have a chance each year to touch, in at least a small way, tens if not hundreds of young people, many of whom will someday have positions of major responsibility.”
By the looks of it, Larry Summers is here to stay. He’s home.

Though I’m red-green color blind and will never understand the obsession with chromatic foliage, I hear Walden Pond is beautiful in the autumn. If you catch it on the later end of October, the drying air heightens the borders of faces or the edges of each watery ripple; everything has the sharp sense of coming into focus. Unfortunately, I went in July.
Last summer, I found myself—a Foster Wallace fanatic studying arts literacy—surrounded by coders and budding biologists in what Harvard had deemed “The Research Village.” That is to say: Mather House, but lacking air conditioning and serving zero meals a day to academically inclined undergraduates in oddly acronymed programs. The upshot of the humid, scientific madhouse was an impressive offering of subsidized weekend excursions in and around Boston, for instance a Saturday day-trip to Walden Pond.
As a self-important Literature concentrator to be, I decided to fashion an immersive aesthetic experience out of what I’d deemed a silly tourist trip. Rather than take the earlier train with the STEM group, I thought I’d embrace “Walden”’s isolationist bent and travel to Concord alone later in the afternoon. Aided by a brand-new copy of the Thoreau’s transcendentalist tome, I planned to commune with the author’s spirit more authentically than other visitors. Free from the incessant gabbing about laboratory hours and Clover vs. Crema, I’d discover anew the value of mental self-reliance. For just a few hours I’d live deliberately and suck the marrow out of life; perhaps I’d discover something essential about Walden pond, “Walden,” or myself.
That afternoon, I boarded the commuter rail dressed in my literati-best: clacking black boots and a matching long-sleeve V-neck, messenger bag swung over my shoulder. The muggy Cambridge summer begged for bare skin, but cargo shorts and Thoreau contemplation seemed incongruous, and I wasn’t willing to surrender my self-indulgent image for bodily comfort.
Walden Pond, it turns out, is a 30-minute walk from Concord, so I soon found myself trudging hazily through the afternoon’s gathering heat, boots far from clicking on the muddy terrain off to the side of a 45-mph highway. Cars honked at the poor struggling pants-wearer, flies gathering around my pooling sweat until I finally arrived at the green patch on my Google Map that denoted the Walden enclosure. I may have been damp, but I was far from defeated—it was time to get away from the modern automobile abomination and walk amidst the trees.
Five minutes into the thicket, the world growing hazier, I found myself unable to locate a clear path toward the pond and no more free of flies and heat. “I can do this, I can still break through this thicket and find the pond,” I mumbled to myself reassuringly. But I was rapidly losing my patience with both wandering and nature, so I picked up the walking pace and looked at my phone for geographical guidance. No service. My eyes darted, my swatting hands lost their precision, and then I lost my mind.
“Nature fucking SUCKS,” I screamed as I sprinted through swatting branches and thick insectile clouds. My remaining visions of a philosophizing Thoreau reclined by the lake had vanished, replaced instead by shots of Snow White in the animation’s nightmarish forest scene—the one where her hysteria transfigures the foliage into the worst 90-second hallucinogenic trip ever caught on camera. Now thoroughly drenched in perspiration, running aimlessly through the woods, and still carrying a messenger bag full of literature, I felt I’d become a bad trip too. “I hate this. I hate nature. Thoreau was out of his mind,” I shrieked, quickly degenerating into a King Lunar lunatic-in-the-wild caricature.
And then, just like in “Snow White,” it was over—I broke through a line of trees and reached my glorious destination, the paradise I’d truly been seeking. I was back on the highway. Without thinking twice, I turned my back on deliberate living and stomped back to Concord, where I ordered a latte and sat down to read “Walden” in an air-conditioned fly-free cafe. I have still never been to the pond.
Before that day, I’d always thought that accessing nature was a matter of mindset, that the only barrier to transcendence was caring about Q scores and comps. All one had to do was approach the world with a more authentic and spiritual intention. Literature—and I suppose dressing like those who read literature—offered something eternal in this respect: a Thoreau-paved path to immersion and deliberate living.
Bugs, however, turn out to be the real barrier, and mindset matters less than appropriate garb. Though we’re apt to quote its aestheticizing passages, “Walden” often reads as a pragmatic, rather boring wilderness guide. It’s filled with inventories of how much wood Thoreau burned and advice on how best to construct lodgings for the winter: a very different sort of life reduced “to its lowest terms” than literati parrots like myself tend to reconstruct.
Then there’s the fact that Thoreau never even lived the deliberate, immersive lifestyle he presents in “Walden.” He often walked into Concord for a drink or meal, and he maintained vibrant ties to friends and communities outside of his secluded environment. Like me, he romanticized the harshness of the woods, using language and performance to coat what’s mostly a practical challenge of staying warm and well-fed. His ability to leave nature, in many ways, was the very thing that let him reflect on it so seductively. Sitting in that Concord café with skepticism and soy milk foamed over espresso, I realized I’d rather read about the woods than walk through them. Maybe I wasn’t too far from Thoreau’s “Walden” after all.

Even if you don’t consider yourself a well-informed person, it won’t surprise you to hear that the world’s not doing so hot. Disregard the global economy and ponder this: America’s future leaders have opted out of reality and turned into slackers. By slackers, I mean those who practice slacklining, i.e. the new Spikeball.
A MAC Quad-ready concept, slacklining is simple. Slackers (yes, that is how they self-identify) tense a nylon or polyester webbing between two anchor points and attempt to traverse a treacherous, narrow path suspended high above the ground. Some liken it to tightrope walking.
Those people are also dense. The webbing is more like an overpriced and overblown rubber band. It’s suspended to a height fit for a toddler above the soft, wet October earth. The most slackers have to fear is a muddy butt and a bruised ego.
What’s more, slackers don’t acknowledge the risk-taking cultural icons who made their faux-daredevilry possible. Slacklining continues our nation’s horrific history of maligning circus highwire artistry. You can’t ride a unicycle, cook a fried egg, or balance bowling pins on your nose while slacklining. Where is the Philippe Petit of slackers? When will there be a slacking Wallenda family, a troupe of German high-wire artists who continue to risk and lose their lives for the art’s sake?
The answer is a resounding never. It’s the Smith Campus Center of stunts: a low-stakes rebranding of a classic idea, focused at those who refuse to dream big.
Slackers claim that the lack of serious physical risk make the activity a family-friendly, pick-it-up (and then likely drop it) diversion. How many parents really want their children experimenting with this entry-level hobby? Kids may be bewitched by slackers’ facile balancing act between false danger and easy success.
Here’s a tip, parents: go big or go home. Slacklining is feeble adventure. Introduce your child to rock climbing, or better yet, bungee jumping. If little Shelley is more of a wallflower, introduce the art of calligraphy, or book illumination. Our kids should be taking a chance and shooting for the stars, not wavering a few inches above the ground on a glorified bungee cord.

Students take time off of Harvard for any number of reasons. They volunteer at non-profits, study abroad in the Middle East, find high-power internships, or work on political campaigns.
Others want to dance.
Among them: Kaledora F. Kiernan-Linn ’18, who recently announced her leave of absence from Harvard in order to pursue dance full-time with the Boston Ballet; Jennifer Wang ’18, who is taking her next semester off to dance at Joffrey Ballet in Chicago; Sofie Rose A. Seymour ’15, who took a semester off last year to choreograph dances for the American Repertory Theatre; and Javier F. Aranzales ’16, who is taking this semester off from Harvard in order to dance abroad as one of the founding members of Colombia’s first national ballet company.
Professional-level student dancers are a rare breed. The time, coordination, and dedication demanded by dance makes it nearly impossible to simultaneously maintain a full academic schedule and a professional ballet career. Many students find it debilitating to balance the two pursuits.
Up until the week she took her leave of absence from Harvard, Kiernan-Linn, who goes by the stage name Kaledora Fontana, would wake up early, take the T to ballet, skip part of rehearsal to sprint back and attend classes, head back to ballet, return to the dorms to do homework, and catch a few hours of sleep late at night. Another full day of dance would await early the next morning—and every morning after that.
“I felt like I was jeopardizing my position in both places,” she explains. The missed rehearsal time was quickly adding up, and it became increasingly difficult to maintain the level of focus required to both perfect dance moves and complete a full college workload. “I realized that you won’t get the most out of your college experience if you’re trying to do too much,”
Kiernan-Linn says, “and I was doing all the hard stuff without getting any of the reward. For me, taking a leave was my best option.”
Kiernan-Linn is not the only dancer to face such a dilemma. Wang, who is taking next semester off to dance for the prestigious Joffrey Ballet in Chicago, shares her own hectic schedule. “In terms of classes, I signed up for Ballet III, which meets on Mondays and Fridays for an hour and a half, Ballet II, which meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and a half, the Jose Matello Ballet Theatre drop-in class on Wednesdays for an hour and a half, and the Harvard Ballet Company class on Sundays from two to four. While Saturday is technically my ‘day off,’ I usually have an hour of rehearsal on Saturdays too.”
And if having ballet every day of the week wasn’t enough, none of these dance classes are for credit. “This semester I’m also taking Ec10a, Math 21a, Chinese Ethical & Political Theory, and Expos 20,” said Wang.
Frenetic schedules among student dancers are not the exception, but the rule. Last year before his semester off, Aranzales danced for the Harvard Ballet Company, performed with the Expressions Hip-Hop Dance Company, and participated in Ghungroo, Harvard’s largest South Asian cultural dance showcase. “Each of these brought weekly rehearsals about three hours each,” he wrote to FM in an email. “I also incorporated two weekly ballet classes into my schedule the spring semester of my sophomore year.” Currently, Javier is in Bogota, Colombia dancing as a founding member of Colombia’s first national ballet company.
“[Here] I am dancing Monday through Saturday, 12:30-5. [We] begin each day with our sacred ballet class [before diving] into rehearsals for our upcoming tours and shows.”
For Seymour, on the other hand, “it’s always been a mix between theater and dance.” In addition to being involved with the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club since freshman year (with rehearsals for shows alone running from 4-15 hours every week), she also dances with the Harvard Ballet Company and the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company, co-develops the Harvard Dance Project (the first dance class on campus that is offered for credit), and works to advance social awareness through dance choreography. “At a certain point I’ve realized that [dance] is the language through which I work. It’s the language through which I think, and if I can keep pursuing it at a high level, I can find a way to pursue social justice through dance,” she says.
For Wang, prioritizing time for academics meant giving up time for ballet. “It was so difficult to keep up,” she  admits. “I was doing pretty well when I first started, going to all my classes 5-6 days a week. But for the past couple of weeks, midterms have been killing me.” She explains that the dance center is in the quad, so while the class is only an hour and half, it’s actually a three-hour process. “It was okay at first, but it was just getting harder and harder to actually get out of my seat, where I’d be doing homework, to go dance. When too much was happening, I would just be too stressed to go.”
Kiernan-Linn echoed this sentiment. “I found myself doing the bare minimum, trying to survive my classes instead of getting the most that I could out of them. And that’s not what I was here for,” she said. “It was the same thing with ballet. I wasn’t pushing myself to the fullest because I was physically exhausted. I felt like my body was giving out—like if I pushed myself any harder, I would have hurt myself.”
Despite the rigor and commitment required by ballet, Harvard students who choose to take time off to  pursue dance professionally find their sacrifices worthwhile.
“I know how lucky I am,” declares Kiernan-Linn. “I’m so, so, so fortunate to have found what I wanted to do at age 7 or 8. And it wasn’t like I was ever trapped into dance because of my family, or because I felt like it was something I had to do. I could have quit it in high school, or when I got into Harvard, or even now. I’ve always had the chance to do other things. But I’ve never left it because it gives me joy.”
Aranzales started dancing when he was 13 after being inspired by a classmate’s ballet performance in the 8th grade talent show. “I went to the Thomas Armour Youth Ballet conservatory in Miami with my father on one rainy day in June and nothing was ever the same,” recounts Aranzales. After dance came into his life, it became his form of mental and physical rejuvenation, as well as his go-to source of happiness. “One is very fortunate in life if they are able to find that one thing that fills them with so much life and joy, and I am very blessed that for me that is dance.”
Seymour similarly finds dance an essential part of her life. “I am not happy nor sane unless I am dancing. I’m more fun to be around when I have dance in my life, and I’ve come to accept that I can’t live without it,” she says. She explains how a decade of dancing has changed the way she approaches the world. “At this point, I don’t know if my brain is naturally wired, but movement has become another language or lens through which I see things. Even when I’m not dancing I see movement in music. When I’m bored on trains I picture dots moving in circles.”
“I would describe ballet as my life,” explains Wang. “Performing really makes it worth it in the end, when people are finally seeing all the hard work you’ve been putting in. That feeling that you get when you perform is something that you can’t get anywhere else. It’s such a rush of adrenaline, to be able to dance on stage.”
Fortunately, a college education and a professional dance career do not have to be mutually exclusive. Instead of pursuing the two simultaneously, Aranzales plans to focus on one at a time so that he can get the most he can out of both experiences. “I am very grateful that Harvard made this choice so easy because of its flexibility with students taking time off,” Aranzales wrote to FM. “With Harvard’s supportive policies, it was a given that I would take time off to pursue my wildest dream and [then] return to Harvard when I feel fulfilled with my dancing experience.”
Wang expressed a similar sentiment, declaring, “This has worked out so perfectly. I got to go to Harvard, I’m going to be able to dance professionally, and I can come back if I want to. It’s the best possible scenario.”
Kiernan-Linn knows that she wants to come back to finish her education, but she’s not sure when. “The future is completely unknown. There’s no certainty, and it’s scary. I don’t know when I’ll be able to come back. It could be next year, or it could be in ten years. I was telling this to my artistic director the other day—basically crying in  his office—and you know what he told me? He said, ‘that’s the beauty of it.’”
There is a certain beauty in taking the road less traveled at a school where roughly one in three graduating seniors will go straight into finance or consulting.
As scary as it is to break into unchartered waters, these students have found it liberating. “It makes me so happy, it’s so rare—and while it’s so sad for me to have to give up going to Harvard at this exact moment, this is an opportunity that I can’t give up,” says Kiernan-Linn. “This is the only time in my life that I’ll be able to dance."

Lazy and at a loss for a Halloween costume? Never fear! The costume you’ve always dreamed of can be found right here in the Square—you just need to know where to look. Luckily, FM has collected some hidden Halloween gems.
1.     The Curious George Store
With its neon yellow and fire-engine red painted exteriors, this shop is impossible to miss on a stroll through the square. If you're like most people, though, you've only ever strolled past the doors without going inside. You should reconsider that decision if you’re dreaming of being the Man in the Yellow Hat™ for Halloween: They have hats, yellow suits, and Curious George™ monkeys with which to drunkenly cuddle after the costume parties.
2.     Brattle Square Florist
Thought you would never have need of the shop’s wide-ranging selection of flowers? Think again. Drape yourself in strands of ivy, weave a flower crown out of dainty pastel lilies, and glue bromeliad leaves to your skirt, et voila! You're Earth Goddess/Mother Nature incarnate. Alternatively, you could grab a couple Hawaiian leis and get “lei-d.”
3.     Urban Outfitters
You knew you could come here for a million giant sweaters and artfully ripped tights, but did you know that thanks to this store, you could also be the proud owner of a giant horse, dog, or unicorn mask? Grab two friends, and together you’ll be the trio of disembodied animal heads.
4.     Hidden Sweets
Let’s face it—in a shop so jam-packed with novelties, the costume possibilities are endless. Cover yourself in postcards printed with inspirational quotes, and dress up as a walking source of midterms motivation. Or buy an “It’s a Girl!” balloon, a baby doll, and a giant coffee mug, and call yourself a "new parent."
5.     Harvard Yard
Feeling lazy and low budget? You can find a costume without even setting a foot off campus. Snag a lanyard, a class of 2018 t-shirt, and a yellow LS1A backpack. Ta-da: you’re a freshman!

SCENE: THE LIBRARY. (Curious Freshman removes a catalogue-card from its proper place). 
NOAH. Look here, sir! Don't you know it's against the rule to take those cards from the drawer?
CURIOUS FRESH. But I suppose it's no matter, as I did it insensibly.
NOAH (excited). Yes, but it is! You will incense Sibley, if you are not careful!
This comic dialogue was included in the “Brevities” section of the very first issue of a newspaper called “The Magenta,” published on January 24, 1873 (it would later be renamed The Crimson). Though satiric, it sent a cautionary message to the unsuspecting freshman class: mess with John Langdon Sibley, the University’s head librarian, and you’ll regret it.
Sibley easily commanded this kind of fear and respect: He worked in the library for almost 45 years, from 1841 to 1885, and served as head librarian for more than 20 of those years, until failing eyesight finally compelled him to step down. Even upon his retirement in 1877, he remained on campus as “librarian emeritus.” In his time at the library, he outlasted two wars and six Harvard presidents, and witnessed the beginning of Harvard’s transformation into a modern research university. Although he is most remembered today for his extensive series of biographies of early Harvard students, he also kept a personal journal that spans nearly 37 years of the College’s history. Within its pages, he provides us with a glimpse into everyday life at Harvard 150 years ago.
When Sibley began his journal in 1846, Harvard was a sleepy jumble of buildings on the outskirts of Boston. Holworthy was the biggest and most luxurious of the four existing dormitories, and students ate meals on the second floor of University Hall. By the time of his death in 1885, the Yard—then illuminated by gas lighting—was fully enclosed by four additional dormitories. Memorial Hall had been erected on what was previously a football field, and Cambridge had become a bustling urban community. Sibley, himself a member of the Class of 1825, noted all these changes in his journal as they occurred. 
Amidst all the new construction, he was repeatedly disappointed by the College’s refusal to build a new library capable of housing Harvard’s rapidly-expanding collection of books. He wrote in 1874: “[T]he sponging of every graduate to put up Memorial Hall, connected with the pertinacity of Eliot in tinkering up Gore Hall, (on which he is wasting a good deal of money) are almost insufferable difficulties. The general conviction is that Gore Hall is unfit for the purpose [of housing the collection].”
The library was central to Sibley’s life and career. In his journal, he frequently described various trips to catalogue and purchase new books for the College. He would eventually quadruple the number of volumes in Harvard’s collection. He jealously guarded the library’s shelves, and was constantly on the lookout for potential book-snatchers. An entry from Jan. 14, 1847 reveals his loathing towards a repeat offender: “To a certain extent he may be considered as not being an accountable mortal. He seems to be destitute of a moral sense. He took books from the library a year ago without having them charged….He was guilty not only of licentiousness but of mean, low, dirty acts too indecent to be named.” When the student was expelled, Sibley was overjoyed.
Despite these suspicions, Sibley remained fond of the student body. He held a grudging appreciation for the antics of the Navy Club, which performed an annual spoof of senior class elections. Sibley particularly enjoyed watching their yearly selection ceremony. In 1846, he wrote: “The Lord High Admiral is generally chosen because he has been sent off the most times by the Faculty or has been away the longest absent more during his College course than any other member of the class & is rather a wild fellow & popular…The Rear Admiral is generally chosen because he is the laziest person in the class… The person who swears the most is generally the Navy Club Chaplain.”
The students’ pranks, which occasionally proved dangerous, were a constant source of horror and fascination for Sibley. On May 12, 1846, he wrote: “Last evening some one, probably an undergraduate, set fire to a bunch of crackers which exploded in the entry to the President's study.” A year later, he was scandalized that “[t]he students had saturated a large quantity of cotton wool with turpentine & ignited it against the south door on the west side of University Hall. The door was nearly burned through.” On Nov. 19, 1859, he simply wrote: “Tutor Goodwin in effigy tied with ropes to the cross on the west end of the chapel in such a way as to appear as if he were crucified.” In this case, Sibley seemed at a loss for words.
He also enjoyed watching the annual football game between the freshman and sophomore classes, which he described in an 1855 entry: “The Freshmen, as yet imperfectly acquainted with each & with the game, & generally unable to distinguish their classmates from members of other classes, of course, were beaten in the first three games. They were then joined by volunteer Juniors & the Sophomores by volunteer Seniors & they were again obliged to yield in three games more. The play was with great spirit & some violence & brutality.” 
When the increasingly rough nature of these games led to their being banned in 1863, Sibley was amused at the students’ response: “[A] procession appeared…six pall bearers with a six foot coffin on their shoulders, & then the Sophomore class in full ranks. They looked poverty-stricken. Their hats, with the rims torn off or turned in, bore the figures ’63 in front, that being the year of the class, & their apparel such as is suited to the tearing football fight, & their left legs with crape on them. The procession moved on in perfectly good order to the Delta & halted under the shade of the trees towards the upper end, where a circle was formed & the coffin passed round for the friends to take a last look at the contents, which were a football with painted frill fastened into the head of the coffin; while the spadebearers plied their spades industriously in digging the grave.”
Whatever Sibley may have thought of students’ behavior outside the library, he remained a steadfast resource for any and all seeking academic support. His generosity even extended outside of his official role as librarian: He became known in later years for giving poorer students loans to help them pay tuition, often paying their fees with his own money. Sibley was a mentor to countless generations of students, who returned year after year to visit him at Gore Hall. 
The College, where he had spent the majority of his life, was his only true home, and he continued to frequent the library until his death in 1885. Many Harvard graduates lamented his passing as the end of an era, and The Crimson’s daily issue announcing his death was printed with black borders. The Boston Globe’s eulogy claimed that “[His] face is familiar to a larger number of the children of Harvard than [that] of any other man connected with the university.”
Ultimately, Sibley would not live to see his dream of a new library realized. Thirty years after his death, however, the University received the funds to demolish Gore Hall and build an enormous new facility in its place—one with more than enough room for all of his acquisitions. Though it was officially built as a memorial to Harry Elkins Widener, its origins lie with the stubbornness and tireless effort of Harvard’s most outspoken librarian.

“Soch-ks, Soch-ks”
As she tries to wrap her lips around the hard consonants of the English language, my grandmother fumbles with my small Nike garments. Turning them over and over, she attempts to enunciate the lone word in her English lexicon without much success.
“No es tan dificil, abuela. Solo tienes que pronunciarlo con un poco mas fuerza.”
My appeals in her native language prove fruitless. At eight years old, I can think of few other ways to help her pronounce the word correctly. My brother storms off in frustration, unable to understand why his grandmother can’t grasp both English and Castellano—the Catalonian name for Spanish. My grandmother, a fragile brunette of nearly seventy whose love for her only nietos knows no bounds, speaks four languages, but English is not one. After another hour of difficulty, we stop. Attempts at different clothing items have proven no more successful, and trying to explain the concept of hyphenated words—far more common in English than Spanish—is beyond me. The disappointment is etched into both of our faces: hers because she feels she has let down her oldest grandson and mine because linguistic barriers are the harder of the two chasms I have to cross to talk to my grandmother. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean is simple by comparison.
Mi mama, proficient in regional dialects Aranes and Catalan, as well as globally known English, Spanish, and French, shares her mother’s myriad fluencies. I inherited little of the affinity for languages. Even as she spoke Spanish to me from a young age, I struggled to pick it up. Sounds and syllables that flowed smoothly from her mouth stumbled in mine. The understanding was there, the speech was not. As such, our interactions are confusing to most bystanders; her mellifluous castellano and my brash, Texan-accented English make for unique bilingual dialogues. Ashamed of the broken Spanish I speak, where the melodious romance language is turned into a stumbling rendition of incorrectly pronounced double ells and misplaced accents, I resort to the more comfortable English in our conversations.
When my family travels to Bossost, the rural town of 1,200 in which mis abuelitos have spent their entire lives, my shame bubbles to the surface when I am forced into awkward introductions with family and my mother’s friends. Monosyllabic answers are the norm; deflecting questions about my life with a simple “estoy bien” has become commonplace. My understanding is near fluency, but comprehension matters little when I cannot express my thoughts in the language.
As I grow into my twenties, shedding vestiges of puberty as I simultaneously fight my seemingly never-ending battle with stubble, my diction has expanded while my annunciation has stagnated. In Austin, I didn’t make the grating, harsh-consonant heavy sounds of my peers in Spanish class; in Spain, my attempts at speech lack the harmony of romance languages spoken by a true native. Yet, there is progress. Recently, I am increasingly less reluctant to speak and the joy on my grandmother’s face is palpable. After conversing with me in Spanish, her face lights up until I meander back into the comforting English I share with my brother and father—where the linguistic idiosyncrasies are familiar and the pronunciation manageable.
However, internal difficulty with the basic tenets of the Spanish language is just one part of the problem of reconciling disparate languages into a cohesive identity. When applying to college, my friends joked that my choice to label myself as a Hispanic on the ethnicity component of the CommonApp was an affirmative action ploy. More hurt than I let on, I submitted an essay centered on my memories of Spain, a de facto defense of my Hispanic identity. Disparate heritages ranging from rural Spain to Ashkenazi Jew have created an odd amalgam of ethnicities with which my brother and I identify. My agnostic mother once told me that my grandmother, a devout Catholic, was beside herself when she learned we would be raised as Jews. My Chicago-raised father communicated with his parents-in-law from the start in French, unable to comprehend the Spanish swirling around him at the dinner table.
Repeated attempts to teach my grandmother English are my way of trying to collect under one banner the heritages that pull me so many ways. Perhaps by inviting her into my American world, I hope, we can share a connection that transcends our communication boundaries. Her feeble attempts at English are a longstanding joke—“Soch-ks” are frequently pointed to and laughed about. As my Spanish improves, our conversations have lengthened and monosyllabic responses have expanded to sentence fragments and the occasional full sentence. Playing games and watching television together provide a communication buffer of sorts; sharing experiences without talking brings us closer together while keeping the articulation demons at bay.
Fourteen months after my grandfather passed away, I’m think every day of my grandmother—my last remaining grandparent and my only relative I still struggle to communicate with. Eleven months of the year, our relationship exists over the phone. For a woman terrified of Siri—la senora que vive en el telefono—Facetime is hardly an option. In her advanced age, with scoliosis crippling her movements, I’m quite aware that there may not be many more meetings. We will embrace, we will make jokes about “Soch-ks”, we will feast on deviled eggs and tasty macarrones, and we will once again try to cross that linguistic chasm. My broken Spanish, her mellifluous castellano. Ten years later, still trying to find a linguistic middle ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University will apply new “green” standards across all 12 schools to reduce waste and energy use, as a part of a first-of-its-kind five-year sustainability plan announced Wednesday in a community-wide email from Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp.
University-wide goals include reducing per capita waste by 50 percent and water use by 30 percent by 2020, from a 2006 baseline. The University also hopes to use organic landscaping for at least 75 percent of landscaped areas by 2020.
Other efforts consolidated in the plan include bringing all University facilities into compliance with Harvard’s Green Cleaning standards, creating standards for climate preparedness through the development of new building and critical infrastructure design techniques, and developing University standards for environmentally friendly vendors and products.
“These are all University-wide goals, so we’re not expecting the same implementation in every building,” Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office of Sustainability, said in an interview earlier this week. “There’s always going to be one campus that is really good at something and one campus that struggles more,” she added, noting that schools with a large number of labs would face more difficulty trying to reduce their energy usage.
Harvard has already been working to cut greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2016, compared to a 2006 baseline. In April, University President Drew G. Faust wrote a letter to the Harvard community detailing progress toward that goal, introducing other measures to increase campus sustainability, and pledging continued action by top leaders.
The Harvard announcement comes one day after the University of Pennsylvania released its Climate Action Plan 2.0, which will invest $190 million in projects to promote environmental sustainability on campus.
While Penn’s plan mainly addresses climate change and emissions, Henriksen said, the Harvard plan takes a more “holistic” approach, with a greater emphasis on everyday campus operations, health, and sustainability research. Henriksen and others at the Office of Sustainability cited Arizona State University’s plan as a more direct model for Harvard’s program, pointing to ASU’s emphasis on faculty involvement in sustainability research and teaching.
In addition to comparing notes with other universities, Harvard sought to “benchmark” its plan against “leaders broadly in sustainability” in both government and the private sector, according to sustainability spokesperson Colin B. Durrant.
Starting in the spring of 2013, the Office of Sustainability gathered feedback from students and faculty to begin developing the plan, working with students from the College and graduate schools on the Council of Student Sustainability Leaders.
To chart the progress of individual schools, the Office of Sustainability plans to coordinate meetings every two months for facilities and operations managers at each school, who will be responsible for implementing the sustainability plan.
Jaclyn Olsen, the Office of Sustainability’s assistant director, said that in addition to bimonthly meetings, the office will publish annual reports outlining the University’s progress toward its goals.
“We’re really trying to be transparent about what we’re doing well at and what we’re not doing well at so we as a community can push ourselves to go farther faster,” Henriksen said, adding that she hopes Harvard’s sustainability plan will influence other institutions.

Greek life at the College continues to grow, as the recently established Kappa Sigma "colony" moves towards recognition from headquarters as an official fraternity chapter.
The colony currently boasts about 60 members, according to Director of Chapter Services for the Kappa Sigma National Chapter Leo J. Brown.
The launch of the Gamma Eta chapter in February marked the return of Kappa Sigma to campus more than 80 years after the original Harvard chapter voluntarily dissolved in 1933.
Brown praised the colony’s efforts so far, noting that the new members are “quite clearly putting their mark on the programming and the foundations and giving us something that you can tell they worked on.”
He added that the Harvard colony has participated in campaigns spearheaded by Kappa Sigma alumni and in service events with fellow chapters at Boston University and M.I.T.
“We have fairly good chapters in that area in Boston, so we do try to let them get connected to other guys that are in Kappa Sigma locally,” he said.
The president and several members of Kappa Sigma at Harvard declined to comment when reached by The Crimson.
Brown noted that the colony has attained the necessary number of members to be considered a chapter and can proceed with the remaining steps to re-charter as a formal chapter within the upcoming months. He said that to his knowledge the fraternity does not yet possess a physical space, as colonies are encouraged to delay securing such a space until they have been approved as full-fledged chapters.
Brown expressed his hope that the colony at Harvard will continue to promote service work, recruit men to join, and eventually become an award-winning chapter of Kappa Sigma.

UPDATED: October 28, 2014, at 1:55 a.m.
A panel of scholars and former U.S. diplomats argued that the current conflict in Hong Kong has historical roots during a seminar Wednesday afternoon.
The event was part of the weekly seminar series, entitled “Critical Issues Confronting China,” which was initiated in the fall of 2013.
Dalena Wright, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School of Government's Ash Center for Democratic Governance, gave a historical analysis of Hong Kong since colonial times, mentioning that conflicting interpretations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 were partially responsible for the confusion in Hong Kong today.
She also said that the Chinese government’s practice of introducing democratic institutions incrementally has contributed to political and social disputes. Wright called Chinese worries of foreign intervention in Hong Kong baseless.
Burton Levin, a visiting professor at Carleton College and a former U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, talked about how he witnessed the transformation of political life in Hong Kong.
Levin said that although “there was no political life” in Hong Kong back in 1955, Hong Kong now enjoys greater freedom and civil rights.
“It is essentially a free society, but not a democratic society,” Levin said.
He added that the prevalent animosity in Hong Kong could help illuminate other modern conflicts.
“The most powerful motivation [for the conflict], in my opinion, is the growing friction and antipathy and economic problems of the Hong Kong people, which they believed was created by the behavior of mainland Chinese in Hong Kong and that created all kinds of social and economic problems,” Levin said.
Levin also mentioned that unfriendly relations between citizens of Hong Kong and mainland China has become a troublesome problem.
“There is a very serious growing antagonism toward mainland Chinese,” he said.
Stephen M. Young, former U.S. consul general in Hong Kong and the former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, talked about the future of Hong Kong.
“I do think that there is going to be an ongoing struggle [between Hong Kong and mainland China],” Young said.
Sociology professor Ezra F. Vogel, a co-organizer of the seminar, spoke after the event about what he hopes the weekly seminars will achieve.
“The purpose [of the seminars] is to provide the Harvard community a general picture of what issues China is facing and to inform them to keep up with current issues of China,” he said.

An earlier version of this article misquoted Dalena Wright, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School of Government's Ash Center for Democratic Governance. The misquotation of Wright has been removed from the article and replaced with a paraphrased version of her remarks. The article also incorrectly stated that Wright said Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 lacked clarity. In fact, Wright said that conflicting interpretations of the Declaration led to a lack of clarity, not the language of the document itself. Finally, the article incorrectly stated that foreign intervention has contributed to political and social disputes in the region. In fact, Wright said that Chinese worries about potential foreign intervention in Hong Kong has no basis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 23, 2014, at 1:00 p.m.
After months of renovation, the Arts and Humanities Café at the Barker Center formally opened its doors on Wednesday to positive reviews from students. The café welcomed community members to an open house that featured refreshments, as well as a glimpse at the café’s new interior design.
The café was designed to facilitate discussions about the arts and humanities, as well as feed students and faculty coming and going through the Barker Center.
“We renovated it to make it more conformable, more inviting, to make it a space where you would want to have a cup of tea or coffee and chat with your friend about an art project or a book you read or a story you are writing,” said Diana Sorensen, dean of the Arts and Humanities Division.
Featuring newly-restored hardwood floors, panoramic ceiling-to-floor curtains, and rustic bohemian furnishings, the café has been completely remodelled from top to bottom. Even the air conditioning and heating systems have been replaced.
“It seems like a nice place for collaboration. There lots of tables where you can talk,” said Saranya Vijayakumar ’18, who has a freshman seminar in the Barker Center.
Like the physical space, the café’s menu has also been remodelled. It now features a wide variety of new food and beverage options, supplied by Hi-Rise Bread Company and Counter Culture Coffee, respectively.
“[The Café] seems like a great idea, especially because the food they are serving now is so good. Everyone loves Hi-Rise,” said Rachel A. Orol ’15, who attended the event.
However, others noted that the higher price range of food and drinks offered at the cafe may be a deterrent for students.
“The food is pretty pricey,” said Ajay Singh ’18, a student in attendance at the event.
Still, others noted the practical benefits of the café. Hurlbut resident Sean Dillett ’18 was most excited by the café’s proximity to the Union dormitories.
“It’s nice that there’s food so close now,” Dillett said.
The café is hosting a number of events in the coming weeks, including a Dylan Thomas centenary reading sponsored by the Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures, a concert by the Cantab Cowboys, and a storytelling night.
“A café has to be a place where you can linger, without having to rush out because you don’t have a place to talk–that was our inspiration,” Sorensen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although implementation is just a series of approvals away, much has yet to be determined for Harvard’s first-ever dramatic arts concentration, those who have guided the proposal through years of fits and starts say.
A recommendation for the new concentration first came before University President Drew G. Faust in 2008, but was left without a source of funding to make it a reality. That changed on Monday when Faust publicly pledged $5 million to move a proposed “Theatre, Dance, and Media” concentration off her desk and into the the final stages of development.
In Dec. 2008, a report from the University’s Task Force on the Arts recommended the creation of a “dramatic arts” concentration, pointing to 45 students who declared special concentrations in theater since 1984. Between 2010 and 2014, six special concentration degrees have been awarded in related fields, according to the Committee on Special Concentrations’ website.
The timing of the recommendation was “terrible” as the financial crisis hit concurrently, according to English professor Martin Puchner, who formally proposed the “Theater, Dance, and Media” concentration.
His proposal, he said, “[tries] to pick up where things had been left off.”
As the financial crisis receded, members of the Committee on Dramatic Arts, which currently oversees a secondary in dramatic arts, began developing the proposed concentration’s philosophy and preliminary logistics in 2011, immediately after Puchner was hired as the committee’s chair. In the process, members consulted with faculty from drama departments at Yale and Columbia, as well as students in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club.
Puchner said that after this year-long process, he formally proposed the concentration, hand-delivering the proposal to Faust in the fall of 2012.
Since then, Puchner has been leading the charge to turn the proposal into reality; in an interview last Thursday, Faust called him the proposal’s “real engine” and “faculty leader.” With the proposal submitted, Puchner has spent significant time since 2010 trying to secure funding from donors, speaking with Harvard Campaign showrunners, as well as presenting to the Board of Overseers in Feb. 2013.
The governing body, Puchner said, was especially supportive of the inclusion of the “media” component of the concentration. He called this aspect “forward-looking,” and said that it accounts for the changing landscape of the arts.
“The boundaries between theater, performance art, visualization art, and installation art are porous,” he said, adding that the loose definition of “media” could help to unite these artforms in a curricular setting.
Director of the Office for the Arts Jack Megan said that even without the financial crisis, he would have liked the project to have undergone a similar process to the one that has played out.
“A concentration like this doesn’t just get jump-started, it takes years of dialogue,” he said.
SETTING THE STAGE
Though it was received Monday as if it were a done deal, the concentration must clear several more hurdles before opening for enrollment.
First, it will undergo curricular review by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ standing committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, according to Puchner. From there, the proposal will go to the Faculty Council for approval.
Puchner said that he expects the proposal will reach the Faculty for a full vote by the end of the 2014-2015 school year, nearly three years after he brought it to Faust.
If approved, the concentration will likely be administered by a committee, rather than a full department, according to Puchner, who added that the existing Committee on Dramatic Arts may be “transformed” to suit this need.
Outside of the approval process, Megan and Puchner said those working on the concentration still have many details to hammer out, like requirements and pathways through the concentration, as well as the hiring of additional instructors. With Faust’s seed money slated to run out within five years, FAS  leaders will also have to secure long-term funding to sustain the program.
Another primary challenge for the concentration will be meeting its needs for space and resources while preserving extra-curricular offerings in the arts, Megan said.
“I actually think that this will be a plus for non-curricular drama. We will need to invest in spaces to be shared by both,” Megan said, adding that he does not see a conflict. “I see a rising tide lifts all boats.”
Puchner agreed.
“In no way does this proposed concentration want to interfere with student-led theater,” he said, a fear that he noted was expressed by members of the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club when he met with them two years ago.
Going forward, Megan said that the solution will arise “through a lot of give and take.”
“We all sort of know a piece of the puzzle,” he said. “Theater is collaborative, so of course this should be collaborative.”

West Africa lacked the infrastructure to contain the Ebola epidemic that has ravaged the region, global health experts said at an “Ebola Teach-In” Wednesday evening.
At the event, which was hosted by Partners in Health Engage and several other student groups, attendees discussed inequality, strategies to contain the epidemic, and how poor infrastructure allowed Ebola to spread.
The event’s organizers began by giving background on Ebola, explaining that the virus is only transmitted through body fluids and is very unlikely to mutate its genome to become airborne.
Storm Portner, a fellow with Wellbody Alliance, a nonprofit working to provide healthcare in Sierra Leone, said that much of the epidemic could have been prevented if the proper infrastructure had been in place.
“I think that definitely there are many, many lessons to be learned,” he said. “Honestly it’s quite sad that it can start that small and end up so big…stronger systems could have prevented what we have today.”
One member of the audience asked whether the international community would “seize the moment” to draw attention to the disparities of wealth that he said were at the roots of the infrastructure problem.
Portner said that Wellbody Alliance, for the past eight years, has been trying to combat “precisely this,” referring to the audience member’s comment.
“Unfortunately, it sometimes takes a crisis to draw attention,” Portner said.
Shawn D'Andrea, an International Emergency Medicine fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital, drew parallels to the international community’s response in 1994 to the Rwandan genocide.
“There are some historic events in the last 20 years that give us all pause, and make us rethink how things are done,” he said. “Rwanda is an example of something that changed how the United Nations’s response mechanism unfold[ed]. My suspicion is that we will see something analogous after this event, but that remains to be seen.”
Another audience member brought up the issue of hysteria in the United States over Ebola, referencing the school in Texas that closed because of fears that a nurse infected with the virus had visited the school.
“I think there’s room to take a deep breath, have a look at where the problems developed, and develop a response,” D’Andrea said. “And I think we’re seeing that happen right now across the country.”
Near the end of the talk, the panelists called for more help in combating the epidemic. Clark Freifeld, co-founder of a website called HealthMap, said that while a software developer might not be “the first thing that would come to your mind when you think of an Ebola outbreak, there are creative ways to apply different kinds of skills.” HealthMap provides alerts and data on infectious diseases.
D’Andrea said that there is also a need for “more providers on the ground” in West Africa right now.
“There’s just not enough hands in the effort so far,” he said.

UPDATED: October 23, 2014, at 5:50 p.m.
Harvard Law School graduates earn $201,000 a year on average by the time they reach the midpoint of their careers, outpacing all other graduate school degree holders, according to a recent survey by PayScale.
Seven out of the top ten high-earning graduate degree programs were law schools, with Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, Harvard Business School, and Penn’s Wharton School of Business rounding out the list. Harvard Law School was closely followed by Emory University and Santa Clara University’s law schools, each trail Harvard in earnings by less than $4,000.
Graduates of medical and dental schools were not included on the survey.
Harvard Law School graduates average a starting salary of $130,000, surpassed only by Columbia University Law School’s graduates, who earn $153,700 on average right out of school.
However Harvard was not entirely victorious. Alumni of Stanford’s Graduate School of Business earned $184,600 on average at the mid-career point, exceeding graduates of Harvard Business School by $3,500.
While many experts now contend that many graduate programs are simply not worth the pricetag, Harvard’s graduate programs remain a good investment, according to PayScale. For example, coming in last out of 55 law schools surveyed, Western State University’s College of Law earn $65,700 after graduation and only $89,800 at the mid career point on average.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Various religious leaders and professors from across the country urged a Memorial Church audience Wednesday night to vote yes to questions three and four on the Massachusetts Nov. 4 ballot.
The event, entitled “Towards a New Dawn,” gathered speakers from across different faiths to speak about Mass. ballot question three, the Affordable Casino Repeal Initiative, which if passed would repeal a 2011 law allowing resort casinos. Question 4, if passed, would allow workers to earn an hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked, up to 40 hours of sick time per year.
Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, started the discussion on gambling and sick hours and said that what affects one member of a community impacts everyone.
Imam Sherif Shabaka, an Arabic lecturer at Duke University, emphasized the shared commitment of different religious members for faith and justice.
“I’m here to stand shoulder to shoulder with my brothers of faith, Christians and Jews, for that great cause,” Shabaka said, adding that “evil is not going to come through to our community and our people while we breathe.”
Divinity School professor Harvey G. Cox Jr. said that despite positive commercials from the casino companies, families and stores will not benefit from an industry “that seeks to spread its tentacles through our lovely state.” Cox added that communities do not see increased revenues from casinos, but instead, witness the ill effects of gambling on low-income individuals.
“We are being asked to climb aboard the Titanic after it has hit the iceberg,” Cox said, referencing the negative economic and social impacts of casinos. “I, for one, would not like to get onboard that voyage.”
Different representatives from religious organizations sang songs and hymns in English, Spanish, and Arabic.
Reverend Virgil Wood, a long time civil rights activist who worked with Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr., flew in from Houston for the event. After an impassioned exhortation for members to continue fighting for justice beyond the ballot, the crowd responding with a standing ovation and a resounding ‘Amen.’
Speaking about question four and increased sick hours for workers, Reverend Luther Zeigler, president of the Harvard Chaplains, said that he does not think it is fair that some of the lowest wage workers have to often risk their jobs if they want to take care of their families.

After faking a lateral pass to her teammate, sophomore flyhalf Taciana Pereira saw a small window of opportunity and took it, sprinting from the 22-yard line to put the Harvard women’s rugby team up, 43-0, against Cornell.
Over 4,000 miles away in Curitiba, Brazil, Pereira’s mother, father, aunts, uncle, and cousins—streaming the September match live through an Ivy League Digital Network subscription—cheered and rejoiced with an enthusiasm that transcended that of the fans at Cumnock Field. They celebrated as Pereira pointed squarely at the rolling camera, dedicating the try to her family back home.
Just over 13 months ago, neither Harvard varsity women’s rugby nor a centralized Ivy League streaming service existed. Now, as the Ivy League Digital Network enters its second year, women’s rugby, men’s squash, and women’s squash join 24 other Crimson teams livestreamed across the country and around the world.
“People in my family who would have never heard about rugby are now watching it because I’m playing, and they actually enjoy it,” Pereira said. “So I think [the network] has a great impact on people around the world.”
Yet, as the breakthrough subscription-based offering continues to expand, the network’s goal of providing accessible and standardized viewership comes at a significant cost. Harvard athletics—the nation’s largest sports program with 42 varsity teams—has reported a net monetary loss for the service.
Widely viewed games, such as those of the Harvard-Yale football rivalry and the March Madness basketball tournament, currently fall under the purview of larger networks like NBC Sports and CBS, depriving the network of potentially substantial gains in revenue from single-day subscription sales. Furthermore, the network’s $71.95 single-school yearly price tag has deterred interested students—including those at Harvard, who have access to streaming services such Philo and HBO Go free of charge—from buying in.
As the Ivy League Digital Network eyes expansion in its second year, a question has arisen: how does the network balance its revenue-bearing identity with its self-prescribed objective of increasing student viewership?
SETTING STANDARDS
When the Ivy League Digital Network premiered 23 live events during its inaugural weekend in Sept. 2013, the conference-wide streaming service was significant, but not unprecedented. Predating the ILDN, Harvard had partnered with network provider Stretch Internet to stream varsity sporting events online, using a similar pricing structure to the ILDN offerings. However, as consolidated networks in other sports conferences around the nation debuted, it became clear that the Ancient Eight was ready for unification.
“The question is what is good for the fans,” explained Imry Halevi, the director of multimedia and production for Harvard athletics. “If you have a fan of Harvard football, the best solution for them is to go one place to watch all Harvard football games-—not to go to our website for home games and go to the Yale website for the Yale game if they’re hosting.”
Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris said the mission to enhance the fan experience began four years ago as the eight athletic directors communed with the intention of joining the band of rivals under one digital heading. The talks accelerated as nationally televised appearances and victories by Cornell and Harvard in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament brought in monetary bonuses, which were then earmarked by the committee for the creation of what would become the ILDN.
With individual schools’ contracts with respective providers set to come to an end, the missing piece was deciding which digital service company would oversee the new ILDN. As Harris, the athletic directors of each Ivy League institution, and other league office members sitting on the pragmatically-named and newly formed Digital Strategy Committee sifted through the various requests for proposal sitting on their desks, a familiar face caught the committee’s eye.
Before 2013, Columbia, Dartmouth, Penn, and Princeton had already employed the company NeuLion as their network of choice. Beyond the basic features of the previous networks, NeuLion offered extras that gave fans what Harris described as “the best technology out there” in their request for proposal and subsequent negotiations.
For Craig and Michele Rea—who had watched their daughter, senior field hockey player Caitlin Rea, for two years with Stretch Internet from their home in Manchester, England—the switch to NeuLion and the ILDN has offered a significant improvement to their viewing experience.
“The quality has vastly improved since the switch to the Ivy League Digital Network,” the pair wrote in an email. “The filming is better, the resolution is better, and now there is very well-informed commentary.”
In exchange for the infrastructure, marketing, and customer service contributions that NeuLion provides, the service receives 50 percent of the money brought in through subscriptions. The remainder is distributed to the respective schools based on the percentage of overall subscribers the school is responsible for.
At Harvard, Halevi said that all funds received are reinvested directly back into the network, paying for expenditures such as the salaries of the 40-odd part-time employees charged with operating all of the technical equipment used to broadcast sporting events.
But just as the number of live-streamed sports and events continues to rise, so, too, does the cost.
AT A LOSS
Athletic programs among the Ancient Eight operate on budgets Harris characterized as “already stretched pretty thin.” The implementation and production costs associated with the ILDN have not helped the situation. Additionally, internal talks of infrastructural expansion and further partnerships with restrictive national streaming services indicate the network is likely to put a greater strain on finances in the future.
Now two months into the second year of the ILDN, the league appears to be looking in only one direction and its members seem relatively unconcerned about the financial implications of its current model.
Making money, according to Halevi, was never in the blueprints.
“Harvard spends more money on the digital network than it brings in,” Halevi said. “Which is fine—that’s not a problem.”
Referring to the ILDN as a service to Harvard fans, Halevi stood firm in assuring that losing money is a risk that Crimson athletics—which foots the bill and compensates for the lack of profits—is willing to take.
“Our goal is for people to get the service that they want and make sure they can follow our teams,” Halevi said. “We’re not striving toward breaking even at this point.”
Harris said that she is excited by the results across the board, regardless of the revenue numbers. She noted that the ILDN streamed over 1,000 events during its first year, accumulating more than 17,000 subscribers, 450,000 unique visitors, and 3,000,000 page views.
“We exceeded all of our expectations—every single one of them,” Harris said. “We’ve been thrilled—the network has been well-received by subscribers, and we’re thrilled with the production quality.”
But as the network expands rapidly and reaches viewers beyond Cambridge, consumer awareness of the ILDN has not grown at the same exponential rate. In year two of its existence, the network has made it a priority to get the word out, whether through emailed newsletters or marketing on the GoCrimson athletics website.
“Growing the awareness is really critical, since we’re still very new,” said Susan Byrne, associate director of athletics for marketing and sales at Harvard. “We’re trying to get more customer service, more content out there...and then try to fine tune the whole customer service aspect of it.”
While viewership data from individual schools and sports is not publicly available, Halevi revealed that he is aware of certain trends at Harvard.
“In general, the sports that draw more in-venue attendance tend to be watched more online,” Halevi said. “Football, basketball, hockey, and lacrosse get more online viewers. The other sports get nice viewership, more than we had in the past.”
Although Harvard’s more widely demanded sporting events could offer significant profit potential from single-day passes, the athletics department has opted to focus on disseminating its broadcast on a wider scale rather than on the finances of the venture. Nine of Harvard’s sporting events for the 2014-2015 academic year will be simulcast on ESPN3, allowing fans who do not already have season passes for the ILDN to have the option of either purchasing a timed online pass or watching the event through their cable provider free of charge.
Though Halevi could not confirm that simulcasting sporting events on ESPN3 diverted page views from the ILDN website, he said that it is “logical to assume” that some interested fans may opt for the free television option as an alternative to buying an online pass.
And according to Halevi, the network sees no flaw in that structure.
“We’re okay with that—our goal is not to make money on this,” Halevi repeated. “Our goal is to have more people support our students, support our coaches, and support our teams. And if we get more viewers when we have a game both on the digital network and on ESPN3, that’s a good deal for us.”
Streaming games through ESPN3 has also been an opportunity to introduce the network to national viewers, which acts as free advertising for the ILDN.
“[ESPN3] is a terrific opportunity to feature the network and showcase it to fans that haven’t subscribed yet,” Harris said. “The hope is that fans will tune in and watch the football game and then say, ‘Wow, this is great production, I’m going to subscribe [to the ILDN] so I can watch the other games this year.’”
However, as the ILDN looks to expand its reach beyond ESPN3 to other national networks with larger spotlights, the Ancient Eight institutions are confronted with self-imposed legality issues as they find themselves without the streaming rights to many of their own high-attendance games.
Harvard’s most widely-attended ticketed athletic event—The Game—is not streamed on the ILDN. Instead, the rights are leased out to NBC Sports, which brings in its own camera crew and production truck, running the show without any of Harvard’s infrastructure.
Similarly, the CBS network reserves the streaming rights to the entire men’s March Madness basketball tournament and the ILDN cannot follow Harvard basketball once it leaves Lavietes Pavillion for the Big Dance.
In addition to the solidified relationships with NBC and CBS, Harvard is making strides to connect its resources to a broader fan base. Recently, the Athletics Department announced that the New England Sports Network will be streaming five of its events throughout the year using the ILDN equipment and crew. However, the recordings will not be uploaded to the ILDN website until 48 hours after the initial broadcast, potentially impacting fans who live outside of the NESN coverage area and are hoping to watch a live stream of the events.
NO TURNING BACK
In an emailed statement to The Crimson translated from Portuguese, Pereira’s mother Andressa Pereira credited the ILDN for having a significant influence on the family during her daughter’s time away from home.
“Being connected to [her] in these moments makes us, even from afar, take part in her routine, like in games when we see each play that she makes,” Andressa wrote in an e-mail. “I regard this as extremely important to support her, and it even makes us feel a bit better about how much we miss her.”
Thus far, NeuLion has met every expectation that that the committee and the Ivy office has laid out, rolling out new technical enhancements in year one such as a single screen, quad-view option that allows subscribers to watch multiple contests at once. And as NeuLion, Harris, and the Ivy League office continue working toward “improving the fan experience”—rolling out Twitter integration earlier this year, for example—all parties affirm viewers are the number one priority.
But although the targeted fans are benefiting from the improved quality and infrastructural expansions of the ILDN, many undergraduates who have not purchased ILDN passes benefit more when external sources broadcast the events. When Harvard men’s basketball advances to March Madness, Harvard students can view the action for free through Philo or CBS programming on cable television.
In the case of many of the earlier season basketball games against fellow Ivy League schools—which often attract fewer student viewers than March Madness—Harvard students need to buy subscriptions from the ILDN website to watch their peers compete.
As the network transitions into its second year, the question of how to market the network to the Harvard undergraduate population is on the minds of many.
In the initial talks preceding the network’s launch, the athletic directors and Ivy League officials discussed offering the network free of charge to the Harvard student population, but the idea was tabled.
“It’s not that it’s not a priority, it’s just not what the league is doing right now,” Halevi said. “At this time, the athletic directors decided they would like to charge money.”
Further complicating any proposals to alter the current system is that it would take more than just Harvard’s desire for the network to be offered free for students for such a change to go into effect.
“Harvard is one-eighth of the [conference], so it would really have to be something that all the teams in the Ivy League could gather on and decide that this would be the best way to get some exposure,” Byrne said.
While future Ivy League conversations may address the question of student viewer accessibility, Byrne noted that serious league-wide consideration of a free subscription offering for students won’t happen until the Digital Network has established itself. For now, $71.95 yearlong and $9.95 single-day subscription fees will continue to be the option for all viewers.
“Down the road, with increased funding, we might want to go to a free model, as opposed to a subscription model,” Byrne said. “That certainly has been discussed, and our biggest goal in all of this is to give exposure to our sports. The best marketing might be offering that at no cost to the consumer.”
Harris seemed less optimistic about the prospects for immediate changes to student membership fees, citing “no effective way to do it because if we gave [students] a code, it would get out and everyone would have it.”
“We think the price is...quite moderate, but we know that students are on student budgets,” Harris added.
Other institutions, such as Williams College from the New England Small College Athletic Conference, offer streaming services free of charge to all interested fans, including the students. Having achieved recognition as having one of the most successful Division III athletic programs in the nation, Williams viewed the lack of cost as essential for fan satisfaction.
“When we sat down and figured out just how many people live at a distance that they can’t comfortably come and see their son or daughters compete, it became more of a service rather than a chance to make money,” said Dick Quinn, associate director of communications for sports information at Williams.
While the athletic directors and members of the Ivy League office alike reacted positively to the idea of providing the network to students at a free or discounted price, it’s still unclear how much exposure or how many subscribers would be enough to push for such a change.
In an email to The Crimson, Harvard Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise echoed Byrne’s statements, and said that Harvard is at the forefront of potential movements to consider a subsidized ILDN for fans.
“We are working with the league to lower the costs for all subscribers to the Ivy League Digital Network and will be happy to propose the idea of a free subscription for all current students,” Scalise said. “We feel that having the broadest exposure possible for our contests is preferred over pursuing a revenue maximization goal.”
“Not everyone in the league currently agrees, but we will do our best to advocate for what we feel is right and fair,” Scalise added.
Byrne said that although reduced costs may be years in the making, Harvard and the Ivy League will take students’ perspectives into account when making plans for alterations within the ILDN.
“[The student side] definitely factors in [to our decisions],” Byrne said. “The goal in year one, year two has been...to let people know that [the ILDN] exists and see what type of response we’re getting from the subscription model. And if we can start getting some interest and some numbers generated with the subscription, then down the road...perhaps then we’re able to consider a free model.”

What better way is there to show your school spirit (and to reiterate to your Facebook friends where you go to school) than by donning a Harvard-themed costume for Halloween? Here are some ideas to help you prepare for any parties you may be attending, whether or not the occasion warrants themed attire.
John HarvardThe most iconic Harvard costume there is. Just be careful that no one mistakes you for the actual statue, and just in case, wear waterproof shoes. What you’ll need—all black, a golden shoe, a stoic face.
Greg MankiwWhile very notable, he may be hard for people to recognize since no one has seen him long enough to remember what he looks like. What you’ll need—just send your friends to parties as “guest lecturers” instead of going.
LamonsterA common sight on campus and perfect for a low effort costume. What you’ll need—sweatpants, bags under your eyes, and a general air of hopelessness, but that could just be your smell from not showering for 36 hours.
Generic Final Club GuyThe next best thing after actually getting punched for a club. What you’ll need—A buttondown, Nantucket Reds, Topsiders, and a false sense of superiority.
Your Midterm GradesThis is a particularly scary one. Or never mind...maybe it’s too soon.
Sexy SecuritasThose handcuffs don’t have to be for arrests.

Happy Thursday! We’re almost at the weekend (#blessed), but it’s still not Friday yet so there’s obviously nothing better to do than complain! Here are some things we’d love to complain about this week:
1) The weather: So like, is there conveniently going to be a downpour only whenever we decide to step outside? Not cool for when you have people to *impress* in section except you walk in looking like you’re sweating/sobbing/having water coming out of every pore of your skin.
2) Midterms: Okay, why is there a midterm at every point of the semester? Isn’t that just not the definition of a midterm?!!
3) Halloween costumes: @world, please stop asking what my Halloween costume is because I don’t know and I won’t know until 20 minutes before going out.
4) Thanksgiving Break: Why are you so far away because all we want to do is eat, sleep and repeat.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It’s going to be really rainy again today, how great! It’s going to be a high of of 57 degrees and there’s a 90% chance of rain, which basically means you’ll need that umbrella and rain jacket all day.
