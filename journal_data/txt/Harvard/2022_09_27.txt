Peacock’s new reboot of “Vampire Academy,” the hit novel series of the same name, hints at a complex world and intriguing characters but lacks direction and substance — and so fails to deliver in its pilot episode.
From the jump, the pilot feels overstuffed. The show tries to establish its mythology — where there are evil vampires, magic vampires, and half-vampires who protect them — as well as the aristocratic vampire society’s complex politics and the vampire high school’s many rules. The show introduces the concept of royal vampire families jockeying to be elected as the ruling monarch without explaining what royals are and how the society is governed.
All in all, despite consisting mainly of exposition, the pilot episode is likely to leave viewers more confused than intrigued. And all of this comes at the expense of character: Very little work is done to establish what vampire royalty Lissa Dragomir (Daniela Nieves) and her best friend/protector Rose Hathaway (Sisi Stringer) want and how their lives are changing. Their background with their families and with each other comes out in hamfisted dialogue rather than subtle, considered scenes.
Moreover, while the titular academy and greater vampire society are functionally and geographically separate in Richelle Mead’s novels, the show conflates the two spheres, creating bizarre power dynamics between high school students and ancient heads of families that are not satisfactorily explored. This is not the first “Vampire Academy” adaptation: The 2014 film of the same name also suffered from pacing issues, resulting in an oversimplified plot. Though producers Marguerite MacIntyre and Julie Plec could be relying on the show’s initial drop of four episodes before shifting to a weekly release model to retain viewers, it seems like a risky strategy to keep viewers invested in the story.
The show has also made changes to the relationship between the protagonists, Lissa and Rose. Where the books portray them as deeply codependent, their friendship in the show comes off as shallow and less interesting. The scenes where they discuss the history of their love and friendship for one another are nice on their own but it’s disappointing that their bond is not a focal point of the episode, and is instead relegated to a few scenes of dialogue. Though the fight choreography is excellent in a scene in which Rose battles an evil vampire to protect Lissa, their mutual concern for each other falls flat, as if they don’t take the danger seriously.
In fact, though the episode is watchable, the performances are consistently underwhelming. The show’s casting was excellent on paper, but lackluster on screen. While both Stringer and Nieves each have a strong moment or two in the episode, they are wooden in many of their scenes and lack chemistry together. Similarly, the show’s many background characters are forgettable, lacking memorable introductions and meaningful contributions to the episode. The show works hard to present disgraced vampire royal Christian Ozera (André Dae Kim) as worthy of intrigue, but his character is given very little to do and is therefore undeveloped. And though the non-royal and mad-about-it vampire Mia Karp (Mia McKenna-Bruce) is compelling, her character is primarily a prop to gesture at conflict between royal and non-royal vampires, a narrative choice that falls flat.
Unfortunately, other production choices in the show do not make up for the mediocre writing. Considering the opulence of the setting of ancient royal families, the costumes and set designs are not very memorable, though thankfully they stand apart from the unrealistic uniforms of teen media such as “Riverdale,” “Euphoria,” or “Do Revenge.” Overall, the show fails to establish a sense of style. The show might have compensated for this shortcoming with a more distinctive tone or sense of humor, but even the script’s excessive swearing fails to create any distinct impact. The inclusion of so much swearing is surprising considering the lack of violence, gore, and sex, and the show’s TV-MA rating. This, coupled with the poorly explained exposition, creates an oblique entry to the world of the show in the pilot episode.
Overall, “Vampire Academy” has the potential to turn it around and become a dynamic, exciting, and intriguing show. It just isn’t quite there yet.

School is back in session at “Abbott Elementary,” and everyone’s favorite teachers haven’t missed a beat since viewers last saw them. The sophomore season of the lovable, endlessly witty ABC sitcom premiered on Sept. 21 and had no trouble living up to the uncommonly high expectations that accompany multiple Emmy wins and internet virality. While network television may have struggled to produce a lasting, buzz-worthy sitcom in recent years, “Abbott Elementary” promises to reverse this trend by providing a story with mass appeal.
“Abbott” sets itself apart from the rest of the crowded television landscape in a quite obvious, yet rather remarkable manner: It tells genuinely funny jokes. By constantly shifting between biting sarcasm and heartfelt naivete, the show strikes an impressive tonal balance, leaving audiences consistently surprised and delighted by the next highly specific quip about the daily struggles of elementary school teachers.
These fresh jokes laced with references to current events are helped along by a cast of characters that covers a wide range of quirky personalities. Quinta Brunson, the show’s creator and star, has managed to mold every member of the “Abbott” team in a way that conforms to the sitcom archetypes that viewers know and love without feeling tired or derivative. Indeed, Brunson expertly demonstrates that there is still plenty of life left in the sitcom genre thanks to creators daring enough to approach it with a unique perspective and cohesive vision.
Two such characters that stand out in the premiere episode are Chris Perfetti’s Jacob and Sheryl Lee Ralph’s Barbara. Jacob’s well-intentioned, albeit slightly performative, progressivism carries over from last season and provides a sure-fire outlet for timely jokes about the latest trends viewers will recognize from their Twitter feeds. A joke about “CODA” inspiring Jacob to take American Sign Language lessons stands out as one of the best in the episode. Recent Emmy-winner Ralph proves her mettle as well, blending Barbara’s tight-laced professionalism and fiery wit to comedic perfection. When Barbara ends a conversation with Mr. Johnson, the janitor, by emphatically proclaiming “you are a fool” in a song-like voice, viewers will quickly remember what makes this show so special.
Returning viewers to “Abbott” will also surely be hoping for the continuation of Janine and Gregory’s “will they or won’t they” relationship following the Season One finale. Luckily, there are plenty of awkward flirting and sweet exchanges in the premiere, with Tyler James Williams acting as the quiet, overly rational foil to Janine’s extroverted quirkiness. Much like Jim and Pam’s relationship in “The Office,” Janine and Gregory’s budding romance is a delight to watch and hopefully their on-screen chemistry will only deepen over the course of “Abbott’” second season.
There’s no question that the general public has become deeply invested in “Abbott Elementary,” and the Season Two premiere will easily confirm to viewers that they have chosen a winner. The show exudes charm and heart, providing comedic insights on the nature of teaching in America and workplace relationships that are simultaneously profound, challenging, and touching. Never afraid to tackle bigger issues, “Abbott Elementary” thrives as an undeniably funny sitcom with something to say.

“Pitch Perfect” has a difficult legacy. It’s a wonderful, hilarious, and empowering film that by all accounts should have been an offensive fail. Ten years on, its flaws are more obvious than ever, but it also stands out as a triumph of late-2000s comedies.
The biggest weakness in “Pitch Perfect” is its laziness. There’s a misogynistic radio host, and that’s the entire joke. Consistently, there is a reliance on harmful stereotypes in constructing characters who are racial minorities or queer. All in all, this should culminate in a really redundant, stale, and derivative rom-com, but somehow it gets two things really, really right.
First, “Pitch Perfect” is not a musical. All of the music is diegetic; it’s actually happening in real time for the characters. They don’t wail and dance about their feelings; they yell at each other like contemporary people in the real world. But in addition to the great vocal performances and iconic cover choices, the music is a great vehicle for the plot. The a cappella group the Barden Bellas sound discordant when they are struggling to mesh as a group. Their use of “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” and “S&M” in the Riff Off are iconic even today, and deftly establish the world and community of a cappella in the film. The audition scene is particularly spectacular for this: The rendition of Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone” holds up today while also doing an incredible amount of legwork to establish all of the minor characters and the role of a cappella on this college campus. The music adds another dimension to what would otherwise be a college comedy, creatively providing an avenue to express the characters’ feelings and growth, as well as being engaging in its own right.
Secondly, “Pitch Perfect” successfully utilizes an unlikeable protagonist to create a story about female solidarity and kinship. The protagonist Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, sucks. She’s obnoxious, self-centered and judgemental. She’s sullen about getting a free college education because she’s mad at her dad for not funding her real dream, which is to head to L.A. by herself with no plans. She looks down on other characters for having interests and caring about things, and only deigns to join the Barden Bellas because her dad makes her. Because she’s the super special protagonist, co-head of the Bellas, Chloe (Brittany Snow), desperately wants her to join. Though she has some valid criticisms of Bella traditions, her refusal to participate and engage means she can’t have a positive impact on the group.
Yet, after self-destructing all of her relationships, Beca is made to reckon with her attitude and also her actions. She admits that she cares about something and that she wants to be a part of this group. And after everything, the revelation is simple: She’s just like other girls. Once Beca gets over herself and respects her friends and the institution she wants to belong to, she’s able to positively contribute and help lead the Bellas into the future.
But more than that, despite the toxicity that makes their relationships so compelling, the female characters care about each other as people. Yes, unfortunately this is a notable bar. It passes the Bechdel test with flying colors — and passes the reverse Bechdel test too. Despite having a romantic subplot, the focus is still on the dysfunctional, fun, and complex relationships between these women who love to sing. Thanks to the music, and the unapologetic focus on a group of young women engaging in an off-beat niche that they happen to love, there is a substance to this film that is just lacking in a lot of comedies. It has something to say, and it does so in an imaginative way that is joyful to watch.
“Pitch Perfect” remains extremely watchable today, and is genuinely hilarious for most of its runtime, so it’s a shame that it has some glaring flaws. And it’s a shame the sequels course-corrected in the wrong direction.

Some say all publicity is good publicity, but this generalized truth meets its match with the melodrama surrounding “Don’t Worry Darling,” including director Olivia Wilde’s romantic escapades with Harry Styles and alleged feud with the film’s star Florence Pugh. After a messy press junket in Venice (and rumors that Harry Styles spit on an unsuspecting Chris Pine), “Don’t Worry Darling” was sent to theaters in a spoiled environment of predisposed skepticism. The film is not as bad as the political pop culture aficionado wants to hear, but not without its major flaws. It effectively captures the frustrations of married life, the confines of femininity, and the fragility of masculinity, but fails to do so in a satisfying manner, lacking the subtlety of successful social commentary.
“Don’t Worry Darling” follows Alice (Florence Pugh) as she discovers that the community she is a part of is a fallacy. Her doting husband, Jack (Harry Styles), works for a mysterious corporation, the Victory Project, overseen by the sinister Frank (Chris Pine). The characters thrive under routine and traditional gender roles, until Alice notices unsettling occurrences that threaten the illusion of her perfect, happy life.
Swing dresses, leotards, lipstick — all the trappings of traditional femininity skirt the screen of “Don’t Worry Darling.” The female characters attend the same dance class, led by the intimidating and powerful Shelley, who is married to Frank (Gemma Chan). As they dance, a chant sounds: “There is beauty in control. There is grace in symmetry. We move as one.” Wilde skillfully organizes and frames bodies to mirror the restrictiveness of traditional femininity that supports only subordinate and beautiful women. Yet inherent in this exploration of femininity is the prominence of whiteness. The film centers on Alice, a white woman inspired to question her surroundings by the discoveries of Margaret (Kiki Layne), a Black woman who serves as a catalyst for Alice’s character development. “Don’t Worry Darling” is ultimately an exploration of white womanhood with a half-hearted attempt at inclusion, illustrating a “symmetrical” experience of femininity that is seemingly possible only between white women.
Olivia Wilde and screenwriter Katie Silberman teamed up again for “Don’t Worry Darling” after collaborating on the endearing coming-of-age comedy “Booksmart” (2019), though their partnership may be better suited for lighter comedy-driven films. The script relies too heavily on spoken exposition from the characters. With a story so dependent on the depiction of social hierarchies, these subtleties are often a result of body language and action rather than explicit discussion. The characters speak in platitudes and absolutes instead of letting the audience interpret the larger meaning of interactions. Perhaps Silberman’s open-face style of dialogue better suits the brazen naïvete of a teen comedy than a psychological thriller that doubles as social commentary.
The construction of an antiquated world in which to deliver the essential messages of the film was important for its efficacy, but the tone was inconsistent and distracting. However, the female characters seemed conscious of their skewed priorities and societal roles, as if in on the joke, making the darker themes of the film overly lighthearted. The performances of the supporting cast were too self-aware and ironic. This choice of tone was likely Wilde’s attempt at comedic absurdity. However, if the characters reflected more genuine self-seriousness, the film would have been grounded in their reality, rather than a forced, inauthentic lightness imposed upon their performances. Only Florence Pugh achieved a realistic performance that matched the imagined Victory Project. Her Alice genuinely believed in love, and that love was complicated by the strain of the community.
Of course, the film’s task was to dismantle the seemingly perfect Victory Project. But the illusion broke too quickly, with the guerilla-style camera-work seen in the opening sequence. The shaky framing emphasized an immediate instability between the main cohort of characters. Outside of the home, cinematographer Matthew Libatique created an unsettlingly perfect golden-hour look for the Victory Project. The cinematography imagined a warm-toned and lethargic West Coast; the soft light drapes the characters in halos, like harbingers of progress. As the film progresses, the lighting garners more contrast, a parallel to the darkening plot. Yet, the crescendo into darkness is interrupted by the intentionally unstable camera work present from the beginning of the film that emphasizes the fragility of the community. The film would have benefitted from a clearer visual arc that mirrored Alice’s character development.
The lack of an effective visual arc was perhaps a result of editing. The film’s plot is not entirely linear, as the rushed ending displays. Wilde intersperses random footage of dancers seen on black-and-white film at various moments, so that the viewer never settles into believing the claims of the Victory Project. Throughout the film, Alice also views herself in different reflective surfaces. This motif serves as a vehicle for self-actualization, as Alice searches for the strength to believe in herself. However, these visual metaphors appear too often. The shots seem repetitive; how often can someone look in the mirror and see something entirely different than the day before? The heavy-handed editing over-emphasizes a feeling of unease.
These technical faults aside, Olivia Wilde still facilitates a dramatic and emotional climax. The cruelty of Jack’s actions is visceral and upsetting, allowing the devastation of betrayal and the shattering of domestic happiness to ring true. The ending is breathless and energetic. It seems that Wilde, too, triumphed in the resolution. Despite the speculation about behind-the-scenes drama, she delivered a cohesive film with a thought-provoking ending. Ultimately, the pop culture jury was not sequestered, but art does not exist in a vacuum. Wilde’s directorial style seems unfit for “Don’t Worry Darling,” and only time will tell whether she will survive as an auteur in a ruthless industry that demands versatility.

The voices of the acclaimed New York Polyphony filled the courtyard of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum on Sunday, Sept. 18, in the first iteration of the Weekend Concert Series hosted by the museum this fall. The quartet performed a series of songs which were written or revived during the reign of Queen Mary I, the first woman to rule England in her own right.
During the installation, museum visitors milled about the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum as the music from the center Courtyard echoed through the adjoining rooms. Though the Weekend Concert Series is normally held in the Concert Hall of the museum, this opening performance in the Courtyard allowed visitors to simultaneously enjoy art and music. One visitor, landscape painter Dan Faiella of New Hampshire, watched the show from the balcony of the Raphael Room.
“It’s heavenly to walk around and see the paintings and hear the music at the same time,” Faiella said. “I also play music, so having the combination of both is really cool.”
Faiella was one of many visitors who watched from alcoves while the four singers performed amongst the live flora the greenhouse-like Courtyard is known for, gracing the beauty of each room with charming music. Also among listeners was the museum’s Abrams Curator of Music, George Steel, who organizes all musical programming — a cause Isabella Stewart Gardner herself was passionate about.
“I think music was Isabella Stewart Gardner’s first love,” Steel said. “[The Gardner Museum has] the oldest museum-based concert series, and it’s a living part of the collection that [Gardner] imagined being a permanent feature.”
The New York Polyphony are foremost performers of medieval and renaissance-era works, touring the world to share music which would otherwise be lost to time. Polyphony, a form of choral performance which combines multiple melodies and tones within the same lines, is characteristic of the music popularized in and around Queen Mary I’s reign. The pieces performed on Sunday were found in the Eton Choirbook (c. 1510) and the Gyffard Partbooks (c. 1576).
“It was an international arms race – from 1400 to 1510 – to expand the tessitura, or the range that choirs sang in, to expand the number of voices, and to just be spectacular,” Steel said. “This [performance] is an anthology of the most spectacular pieces [from the Eton Choirbook and Gyffard Partbooks].”
The music could be heard from the museum’s Dutch Room, where Antonis Mor’s 1554 portrait of Queen Mary is displayed. The portrait served as a message to the queen’s future husband, Prince Philip of Spain, that she would remain the sole ruler of England. The queen is pictured holding a Tudor rose, signifying her lineage, and looks upon the subject with what appears to be distaste.
“She’s not spending her energy trying to be attractive,” Steel said about the unusually unembellished portrait. “She’s projecting power.”
The performance, held soon after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, emphasized the power of the first female monarch of England who ruled in her own right, indirectly paying homage to the late queen. It served as a reminder of the long-lasting significance of British rulers — in particular, female rulers — and the enduring legacy they leave behind. Beyond its specific cultural context, the music simply offered a lovely accompaniment to the experience of the museum’s exquisite collection.
The Weekend Concert Series will hold performances every Sunday afternoon throughout the season, featuring musicians from the Boston area and beyond.
“Isabella adored music and musicians and composers and performers,” Steel said. “She had a restless, witty, brilliant mind and devoted it to many different things, but music first among them.”
Gardner intended her museum to stand for those who appreciate art of all forms, music-lovers among them. With the museum’s plethora of beautiful performance spaces, Steel intends to carry on Gardner’s envisionments and will continue to welcome listeners and musicians alike.

After more than two years of waiting, Lewis Capaldi’s highly anticipated return to music has arrived following the meteoric success of the artist’s 2019 debut album “Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent.” The striking album title came from a discarded lyric that Capaldi says captured how he felt while making the project. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for Capaldi’s latest single “Forget Me,” a pleasant but forgettable return where that divine lack of inspiration seems to truly set in.
“Forget Me” revisits well-trodden ground for Capaldi, who has built an audience through an impressive collection of heartbreak anthems including “Someone You Loved,” “Bruises,” and “Before You Go.” Adding to this repertoire with his newest exploration of heartbreak, Capaldi explores the complicated feelings he has toward an ex.
The song takes place two years after a breakup as Capldi laments, “I hate to know I made you cry / But love to know I cross your mind.” It's a struggle between guilt and relief, knowing an ex can’t quite move on even while Capaldi struggles to do the same. He repeats throughout, “I'm not ready / To find out you know how to forget me.”
The single familiar territory for the artist, but in doing so fails to bring a unique perspective or make the concept feel new. Capaldi attempts to switch up the sadness which has characterized his past releases with jealousy, but doesn’t deliver any real substance or bite.
Of course, the song isn’t all bad. Capaldi’s vocals continue to stun and surprise listeners — particularly those who have been exposed to the dissonance between his charismatic crooning and notoriously chaotic interviews. “Forget Me”’s upbeat tempo stands out as the song’s most unexpected aspect, separating the track from Capaldi’s existing collection of sad ballads. However, the upbeat tempo also serves as the track's greatest downfall. Without Capaldi’s soaring vocals or gritty melodies, the song is left devoid of all the things audiences have come to love about his music.
There’s nothing exceptionally bad about “Forget Me,” but when you’ve set the bar as high as Capaldi has, audiences have come to expect the best. In that respect, Capaldi’s long-awaited comeback failed to deliver. True to its name, “Forget Me” fails to make a lasting impression and won’t be remembered for any longer than its three minute and twenty-four second duration.

“Talking to Yourself” is the newest single released off of Carly Rae Jepsen’s upcoming album “The Loneliest Time.” The track joins “Western Wind'' and “Beach House,” the other two singles released prior to the album’s Oct. 21 release. Together, the three singles signify a departure from Jepsen’s loved-up and upbeat album “Dedicated,” both thematically and sonically leaning in slightly darker directions than listeners have come to expect from the “Call Me Maybe” singer, previously known for her unapologetically glitter-infused pop.
“Western Wind”’s more subdued serenade certainly falls outside of the Venn diagram of excited pop bangers about heartbreak that Jepsen rules with such talent. “Beach House'' is more similar to her previous work, as approaching single life with comedy or even joy is nothing new for Jepsen. But the song, although hilarious, still has a surprisingly pessimistic outlook on the dating pool. “Talking to Yourself,” the newest of the three, feels the most like Jepsen’s previous work, complete with an endearingly desperate lyric and 2010s electronic production. In fact, the less confident refrain “are you thinking of me” and first line “I was always invisible” make the song feel like it would fit right in with Jepsen’s 2015 album “Emotion,” which, as well as unbothered bops like “Boy Problems,” features intensely vulnerable songs like “All That” and “Your Type.” However, the confidence that surged through “Dedicated” doesn’t appear on any of the first three singles from “The Loneliest Time,” and the title of the new album suggests a much darker theme.
This is not to say that Jepsen has gone full goth. “Talking to Yourself” has a punching, belt-worthy chorus and ’80s influences that make it just as danceable as listeners might want. The combination of its lyrical clarity and the millennial whoop in the pre-chorus make it a perfect third single for the album, reminding listeners of Jepsen’s pop prowess and lending itself to grocery stores and brightly colored commercials.
Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t quite measure up to the expectations Jepsen set with her previous two albums. The end of the chorus feels preemptive. The fragmentation of Jepsen’s vocals throughout the song is completely unnecessary and takes away from the relatability that she usually nails. Additionally, now that she has released three songs from the new album, concerns arise about the connective tissue holding them together. “Emotion” and “Dedicated” were both lyrical and sonic masterpieces, stuffed to the brim with strength, pain, and clear throughlines tying the tracks together. “Western Wind” is the best of the three singles released so far, and it’s exciting to see Jepsen trying on a new sound. Yet, there doesn’t seem to be a clear connection between the first three songs.
It could be that these three songs are not good predictors of the cohesion or themes of the rest of the album. However, as Oct. 21 draws nearer, one might prepare for more a patchwork quilt of an album than the concise and cohesive work Jepsen has perfected.

The line to see Australian singer and songwriter Courtney Barnett stretched far down the street outside the House of Blues Boston on Sept. 12, showcasing the cities local hipsters in their finest in beanies, Doc Martens, and a variety of uniquely-patterned pants. On tour for her latest album, 2021’s “Things Take Time, Take Time,” Barnett is an experienced stage presence. From the moment she first appeared amongst the enthusiastic crowd in an all white outfit that absorbed the color of the blue spotlights, she was already perfectly at home.
The concert was a balance of songs from her newest album, opening with “Rae Street,” and beloved songs from across her discography including “Avant Gardener” and “Pedestrian at Best.” Barnett was liberated and unworried as she moved from corner to corner during the first five high-energy songs. She contorted her figure over her guitar, she traipsed in Frankenstein-fashion towards the stage lip, and she spun in circles with straightened, unbending knees: a horizontal spiral, swinging her unbrushed hair.
Barnett’s “Things Take Time, Take Time” is a thoughtful, lyrical collection that captures the day-to-day struggles of the human mind. Her performance style in calmer songs matches her music well: close up to the microphone, arms raised in the air, and a stare that is so real it cuts you. It is her contemplative lyrics coupled with her expressive face that makes it seem like she means everything she is singing. In a beautiful moment that slowed down the pace of the evening, Barnett sang “Depreston,” a softer song from her 2015 album “Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit.” She quieted her guitar so that the crowd could be heard singing along, purple lights seeping from the back of the stage across faces raised to Barnett’s smiling one.
The concert was paced well, mixing pockets of peaceful songs with energetic pieces. The encore was particularly stunning, when Barnett reappeared in front of a grateful crowd to sing three additional songs. Sandwiching “Sunday Roast” with two songs from her new album, she celebrated the 90 minutes spent alongside her fans with “Oh The Night” before finally closing the evening with “Before You Gotta Go.” It felt as if she was speaking directly to her audience: “Before you gotta go, go, go, go / I wanted you to know, know, know, know / you’re always on my mind.”
Barnett’s fans are currently breaking into new ground alongside her, fresh after the March 2022 US release of “Anonymous Club,” a documentary film focusing on her world tour and internal struggles. The film’s website describes the project as initiated by Danny Cohen, a long-time collaborator with Barnett on her music videos, who asked her to record an audio journal beginning in 2018. Rolling Stone describes the film as a “portrait of depression,” while maintaining a “rockumentary” style. This deeper understanding of Barnett undoubtedly influenced fans in the crowd; in the emptiness between songs, someone belted out, “We love you Courtney!”

The whole concert felt like an encounter with a unique presence: someone who is trying to be genuine and honest in a difficult world. It is this feeling that makes her fans love her so much, and that made the concert a fully transportive experience. For a brief moment, Courtney Barnett was our guide, and through her words we equipped ourselves to better step back into the flow of life with grace for ourselves and others. In a 2021 interview with NME, Barnett said, “There’s nothing wrong with sadness or heartbreak — it’s finding the positive lesson or the positive outcome of those moments and thinking how grateful you are that those things happen so they could make you change in whatever way.”

Gina Prince-Bythewood’s “The Woman King” wastes no time in assuring its audience that the next two hours will be far from dull, instead dropping viewers directly into the center of one of many suspenseful battle sequences. A band of women brandishing blades emerge stealthily from the brush in the dead of night to ambush a group of men who have taken their people as prisoners. What follows is a furious few minutes of gritty, high-octane battle that not only set the tone for the rest of the electrifying blockbuster, but also articulates the film’s most important assertion: its belief in the endless skill, heroism, and capability of Black women. Indeed, “The Woman King”’s cultural significance as an unprecedented entry into the historical action genre is perhaps just as epic as the story it tells.
Set in the 1820s, “The Woman King” tells the story of the Agojie — the all-female military regiment who protected the West African kingdom of Dahomey between the 17th and 19th centuries — as they contend with a plethora of personal challenges and menacing antagonistic forces. The ever-brilliant Viola Davis stars as General Nanisca, a stern and diplomatic leader who must train a new generation of warriors to fight an enemy that threatens the kingdom’s liberty and way of life. Among this new class of Agojie prospectives is Nawi (Thuso Mbedu), a headstrong 19-year-old with a turbulent past.
Having shirked her family’s attempts to marry her off for money, Nawi is dropped by her father at the doorstep of arrogant young monarch King Ghezo (John Boyega). Within the palace walls, Nawi’s interest is immediately piqued by the Agojie’s training grounds, and she becomes set on joining the force — and becoming the best warrior of her age. “The Woman King” takes care in exploring the bonds of sisterhood and solidarity that exist between different members of the Agojie — a definitive highlight of the film that allows its already-strong cast to shine. Nawi finds acceptance and understanding in her new sisters, including the swaggering Igozie (a fantastically charismatic Lashana Lynch). The devoted bond between Nanisca and her best friend Amenza (Sheila Atim) is similarly moving
We soon learn that the true emotional core of the film, however, is the complicated dynamic between Nanisca and Nawi, which unfolds throughout the film to a touching and satisfying end. Davis’s stirring performance gradually chips away at the many layers of the no-nonsense general, imbuing Nanisca’s steely affectations with a genuine pathos.
Indeed, “The Woman King” is an epic about strong Black women, but it tactfully avoids the pitfalls of a cultural trope that assumes Black women to be necessarily invulnerable or overly-stoic beings. Instead, the film allows its characters to be dynamic and fairly multifaceted: The physical strength and emotional resilience of these women does not negate their ability to be vulnerable or their need to take care of one another, as much as their occupation and social context may demand apathy and hardness. At one point, Nanisca tells Nawi that “to be a warrior, you must kill your tears.” But the film is at its strongest when exploring how emotion — and addressing, rather than suppressing, one’s pain — can be a source of strength.
But although the Agojie are revered and respected by their community, the inherent structural violence of patriarchy is still very much alive. Unsurprisingly, the society that the Agojie protects so fiercely does not necessarily protect them back. In this way, the women’s triumphs over political enemies and oppressors (and their attempts to liberate other women who have been captured or harmed) are personally cathartic for each of these women. Even if the film’s script — written by Dana Stevens and based on a story she wrote in collaboration with Mia Bello — might have approached some of its complex historical themes with greater nuance, “The Woman King” nevertheless offers a handful of compelling and undoubtedly important characters.
“The Woman King” successfully embeds narratives of personal trauma and conflict within larger systems of oppression, as the specters of slavery and European colonization loom large over the Dahomey kingdom. The existing threat of the rival Oyo Empire is compounded by the arrival of Portuguese slave trader Santo (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is accompanied by Malik (Jordan Bolger), a mixed-race Brazilian merchant whose mother hailed from the Dahomey kingdom. Nanisca confronts King Ghezo about the immorality of his continued participation in the slave trade, selling Dahomey individuals to the Portuguese; she suggests that the kingdom trade in palm oil production instead. This continued conflict — and Nanisca’s insistence that the Dahomey Kingdom see the humanity in even those it captures — elevates the film’s battle scenes beyond mere spectacle: The grave stakes of these battles are felt in each electrifying frame.
Perhaps the primary area in which the film stumbles is its inclusion of a few particularly unconvincing narrative elements — the principal offender being a forbidden budding romance between Malik and Nawi. Although Malik’s racial identity — and the position of simultaneous privilege and disadvantage he thus occupies — makes him an interesting character on paper, the way in which he is utilized feels at once trite and troubling. Indeed, the film’s decision, however noncommittal, to explore an attraction between Malik and Nawi feels like a slightly sanitized take on a tired trope that pairs women of color with their oppressors, usually white men. Furthermore, the two characters’ connection ultimately rings hollow when measured against the several more compelling relationships presented onscreen, flying in the face of the other models of fulfillment and interpersonal connection the film begins to articulate. Indeed, screen time spent with Malik might have been put to better use further fleshing out the film’s key players and character dynamics.
But even this disappointing narrative thread cannot spoil what is, at its core, a visually captivating and supremely exciting action picture. Polly Morgan’s sweeping cinematography is enhanced by arresting production design and gorgeous costumes and makeup that add striking depth and texture to both the palace and battlefield. The film’s lighting, rich color palette, and use of natural landscapes come together nicely to produce many impressive visuals that further elevate numerous rousing, expertly-choreographed battle sequences. Furthermore, Terence Blanchard’s appropriately epic score is punctuated by several scenes that feature traditional song and dance — in this way, “The Woman King” brings to the big screen an exuberant celebration of West African culture that is thoroughly enjoyable to witness.
Both thoughtful and undeniably entertaining, “The Woman King” breathes new life into the studio action film. It’s also a welcome departure from most studios’ usual fare; namely, an endless slate of remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels. Most importantly, however, it carves out a space for histories and identities who have been long overlooked by blockbusters of this scope, placing Black women front and center — never on the sidelines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the lights come on, the audience hears chanting and gospel circling the stage while a young girl looks over a woman with the unmistakable silhouette of Tina Turner’s iconic blond hair. The opening scene sets the tone of the production: centered on an adult Tina trying to stay true to her young self, hold onto the ones she loves, and stay committed to her faith, all while building a successful career.
“Tina” opened on Broadway in Nov. 2019, but like the rest of shows on at the time, experienced a shutdown that lasted over a year. In the summer of 2022, the show announced its closure on Broadway and set out to take on a national tour. On Wednesday, Sept. 21, the show made its debut at Boston’s Citizens Bank Opera House.
The musical is a retelling of the life and career of Tina Turner, an iconic singer, performer, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer. The audience is taken through her life starting from her childhood in Nutbush, Tennessee, adolescence in St. Louis, to life on the road with Ike Turner, their violent marriage and subsequent divorce. In the second half of the show, Tina exists as a solo artist, taking viewers through her struggle to establish herself separate from Ike and as the Tina known today.
The musical’s strengths, unfortunately, don’t lie in the plot. The storyline consists of short, loosely connected vignettes over a large timespan. The songs — which were not arranged in the order in which they were released — at times felt out of place in the narrative. That being said, the talent of the actors playing Tina, her grandmother, young Anna-Mae, and her mother strengthened the performance enough for audiences to sometimes turn a blid eye at the shortcomings of the plot.
The true hook of the whole show is the incredible range of voices the cast brings. Stunningly, one of the cleanest and most powerful voices on stage is that of Little Anna-Mae, played by Ayvah Johnson. In an early scene at church, Little Anna-Mae belts out her first chillingly impressive notes. In the span of only a few minutes, she manages to express the complex rollercoaster of emotions of a young child who longs to feel joy, but is put through hell over many years.
Similarly to young Anna-Mae, Gran Georgeanna plays a pivotal part in Tina’s life, reappearing in moments of reflection or doubt. Ann Nesby, who plays the character, is herself a well-established actress and musical artist, a six-time Grammy solo nominee and two-time winner with her group, Sounds of Blackness. These two characters in particular set teenage Anna-Mae, before Ike names her Tina, to become a deeply passionate young woman ready to pursue her dreams at all costs.
Zurin Villanueva, like Tina herself, is phenomenal. She carries the show on her shoulders as a powerhouse in nearly every song, morphing her voice to age as Tina’s voice did through her decades of music-making. If this musical were a Tina Turner cover concert by Villanueva and the band, it might well have been an even greater hit.
The musical doesn’t shy away from trying to show how Turner’s life was affected by abusive men, from her father to her marriage with Ike Turner. Unfortunately, not all the actors were up to the task of delivering seriousness and the attention necessary to portray these relationships. Especially the portrayal of Ike Turner by Garrett Turner, which at times felt unserious, creates a character who was more strange than evil. Throughout the show, Ike speaks and sings in a gravel voice, adding an air of comedy to incredibly serious interactions.
In the end, much of Tina’s life story is lost to the effort of making a complicated, R-rated story into something digestible and PG. This simplification paired with the inconsistency between song and dialogue makes events from Tina Turner’s actual life hard to distinguish from her imaginary and emotional world. However, the plot does well in the scenes where the awareness of awkwardness is clear, like when Tina and Irwin fall for each other to the backtrack of the non-Tina demo of “What’s Love Got to Do with It.”
Despite the plot’s shortcomings, the performance of well-loved songs shines through. As Villanueva, Nesby, and Johnson sang, the audience was transported back in time — as if hearing Tina Turner herself through each moment of her life.

Rapper, track and field athlete, and engineering sciences major Jaeschel O. Acheampong ’24 is unlimited. Also known as “YoungJae,” Acheampong navigates three different worlds with a deft touch.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the rapper described his tripartite identity. “The student is good in front of parents, church elders…That’s the LinkedIn Jaeschel,” he said with a smile. “As the athlete — whether it’s CEOs or people who aren’t always on the right path — there’s a certain level of respect given to me. Then there’s the rapper. Honestly, rappers aren’t seen in the best light; they’re viewed as people who are smoking, drinking, doing nefarious stuff.”
This September, Acheampong opened for Social House at Harvard’s first in-person Crimson Jam in three years. “I was pacing the whole time before I went on. My mouth was dry. And I was tired — I had my album release the night before and honestly, I had a problem set due.”
Crimson Jam wasn’t Acheampong’s first performance, but he was hoping for it to be his best. By his own metrics, he had failed twice before. His first failure was at Black Convocation 2021 — the audience was seated, floors carpeted, and in the church venue he couldn’t use profanity, meaning he had to alter his set. He performed, but it wasn’t like the “real” rappers that he idolized like Kanye West, The Weeknd, and Kendrick Lamar. He also considers his second performance, at the Nigerian Students Association Gala, a failure, despite receiving generally positive feedback. “I was scared because of the first failure so the second performance just didn’t go how I wanted. I lacked the confidence to pull it off,” he said.
YoungJae didn’t let these two failures limit him. With his self-titled album “Jaeschel,” which dropped the day before Crimson Jam, he planned to teach the audience his music as he performed. He’d plan to skip some words to catch his breath and confidently hype up the crowd before beat drops, guiding the audience to shape his perfect show.
“I was nervous because I was 0-2,” the artist said. “I knew that if I did this right, it was going to work. I knew where I messed up before, what I needed to fix. So if I just stuck to the plan and performed, it’d work.”
And it did work. Entering the stage to a chorus of cheers from classmates, teammates, and new fans, Acheampong began with “avenue,” the first song on “Jaeschel.” As the song slowly picked up, building anticipation, the audience doubled, pulling people in for the duration of the show.
The pressure of a spotlight isn’t new to Acheampong. “When I warm up for a track meet, that’s when I feel the real nerves. But on my first full-speed acceleration, when I see myself flying down the track, that’s when I know: ‘Okay. Let’s do it,’” he said. On the first beat drop of “avenue,” Acheampong clearly hit his stride, shedding his nerves and winning the crowd over.
The rapper continued his set with “talking to myself,” “insomniac,” and “tuned in,” the audience dancing and cheering throughout. The crowd was so engaged that as Acheampong prepared to depart, he was met with a chorus of chants demanding an encore.
Acheampong hadn’t planned an encore. “Mind you, I failed twice before. And now these people I'd never seen before were happy as hell to see me perform. So I said: ‘I want to live this forever. Let's do it.’”He performed an impromptu rendition of “tuned in” with fantastic crowd control and audience participation. He left the stage victorious, proving himself worthy of the cheers that echoed across Harvard Yard.
Before Crimson Jam and his album release, Acheampong was able to keep his identities as a student, athlete, and rapper distinct, avoiding the judgments resulting from their apparent contradictions. Now that Harvard is getting to know the whole Acheampong, he’s had to learn how to let all three facets coexist.
Acheampong’s main concern was how members of his identity groups would perceive his holistic self. “I thought my coach [Marc Mangiacotti] wanted that pure student-athlete. But when I started posting stuff and saw he was liking and sharing, I realized he actually supports this true form of Jaeschel,” he said. His dad, a choir director, showed a similarly appreciated acceptance of his rap career.
A song that encapsulates his blended identity is “wolves,” from “Jaeschel.” “The first half of the song sounds like a church choir. That’s the student, professional Jaeschel. And I’m rapping about being successful in track, that’s my athletic drive. And then being an artist — the song is the most production I’ve ever done and it features artists from home and Berklee. “Wolves” encapsulates all three things that define me most,” he said.
“I gotta keep running / Running so fast Imma crash / But I pick up the pieces and finish / Just sit here in listen / Fuck if my body start failing me I know I got more in my system / So fuck it let’s spin it” — excerpt from “wolves” by YoungJae.
Acheampong’s identity played a significant role in the decision to self-title his album. “I used to tell Harvard people that my name was Jae. And my mom hates that, she’d say, ‘I gave you the name Jaeschel, call yourself Jaeschel. Don't tell people your name is Jae to make it easier on them.’ And that’s when I realized how much weight my name held in my mom's eyes. I wanted this album to tell a story about the raw Jaeschel. Therefore, the best title had to be ‘Jaeschel,’” he said.
Acheampong recognizes the value, even necessity, of navigating all components of his identity together. “In my ideal world, I’m able to excel in each one of those: scholar, athlete, artist. If I can do those three things, it’s the most authentic form of myself. I’ll be unlimited,” he said.
You can find Jaeschel Acheampong as “YoungJae” on Spotify and “Jaeschel” on social media. Support him by sharing his music, and keep an eye out for the deluxe concert version of “Jaeschel” dropping soon.

Even among his peers in the pantheon of indie music icons, Alex Giannascoli, better known as Alex G, is a mythic presence who quickly ascended to record store fame. Since 2010, he has gone from self-recording songs on Bandcamp as a teen to releasing four albums with indie powerhouse Domino Records and collaborating with Frank Ocean. But, as evidenced by the shaky melodies that imbue his songs with wonder, magic happens when Alex G embraces insecurity. He does so to powerful effect on his latest album, “God Save the Animals”, released on Sept. 23rd. It might just be his best album — it’s certainly his most artistically mature and cohesive. On this masterful 13-track record, Alex G grows out of the frustration that dominated his past albums and instead marvels at the grace and beauty in his world.
The driving force behind Alex G’s remarkable career has been his ever-growing cult fanbase, which has supported and obsessed over his work since his Bandcamp days. One visit to the Alex G subreddit makes it clear that its 13,000 active members approach their fandom with religious zeal, poring over Alex G’s ambiguous lyrics like clerics studying scripture. Instead of parables, Alex G relies on autotune, swarm-like instrumentation, and layered vocals to tell his melancholic tales. The result is an addictively unsettling yet cathartic discography that converts new fans with every listen. His mastery of a distinct indie-rock sound has led fans to view him as the second coming of the late Elliott Smith.
Despite his larger-than-life career, Alex G is remarkably human. His semi-autobiographical lyrics paint a sensitive, vulnerable self-portrait, and he’s honest about his artistry. In an interview with Stereogum, he said, “When I’m done with something I know it’s done, but whether or not I think it’s good changes 100% day-to-day. I feel like I hated [2017’s “Rocket”] … I feel that way with every album.”
On “God Save the Animals,” Alex G takes a leap of faith as he faces this uncertainty. In addition to being sonically ambitious, it takes on the difficult task of offering a way forward from grief and adversity that is uplifting but not naive. As suggested by the title, the album contains spiritual themes and Christian motifs. Alex G has clarified that he is not religious but chose to focus on religion as a means of exploring forgiveness and growth. “A few people that I’m close to became religious. It made me wonder what they found. I love exploring those concepts lyrically because I don’t have any answers,” he said in an interview with Pitchfork.
On record opener “After All,” he repeatedly sings, “After all / People come and people go away / Yeah but God with me he stayed,” over a gentle piano melody. The repetition and layering of pitch-shifted voices produce the effect of a children’s choir singing a hymn. But it’s human relationships, not a divine one, that receive the praise. As the song builds tension with increasing distortion and overlapping lines, he tells a close relation, “In the years you feel the most alone / You will build the walls I climb.” Alex G has faith that holding on to loved ones will bring support and purpose even when all else collapses.
Other songs are more complex. On “Runner,” Alex G chatters ecstatically about a dependable friend. With bright soft-rock guitar and a driving beat, the song sounds just like friendship. But true to fashion, Alex G imbues this anthem with a sinister tone. He wails, “Yes, I have done a couple bad things,” before emitting a piercing cry. And in the outro, he chants, “Load it up, know your trigger like the back of your hand.” The threat of violence clashes with the bubbly soundtrack, suggesting that friends can be too dangerously aware of each others’ flaws. Alex doesn’t dwell on this complexity, however — the beat remains bubbly as he “runs” through the song. He has faith that forgiveness and empathy will win out.
These ominous moments are present yet much more subtle than in previous albums. Anger and cynicism can inspire great music, but they aren’t sustainable for artistic creativity and moving forward in life. Alex G is 29, and questions of settling down pop up often in the album. On “Miracles,” he sings lovingly about raising a family — a topic he has previously ridiculed. He also makes space to reflect on his career. “How many more songs am I supposed to write / Before I should turn it off and say goodnight?” he wonders. The indie prodigy no longer feels the need to feverishly churn out albums. He’s proven himself, and can take the time to cherish the miracles around him.
“God Save the Animals” is also a triumph in production. It’s Alex G’s first full-length work recorded completely in-studio with multiple sound mixing specialists. By surrendering control and intimacy in the creative process — it’s no longer Alex recording on a laptop at home — he creates a more unified and inviting musical experience. His mixing of genres, from folk to hyperpop, feels more deliberate, acting as an amplifier of his message instead of distracting from it. On the enigmatically titled “S.D.O.S”, a ghoul-like distorted voice overpowers a playfully eerie piano melody as it chants, “Naked in my innocence.” In contrast to this demonic chorus, the song transitions into a more pop-like R&B beat as a bratty, autotuned voice taunts back, “God is my designer / Jesus is my lawyer.”
For Alex G, the difference between heaven and hell comes down to how a voice projects. With this album, he shifts his artistic voice to preach a grateful, not defiant, acceptance of life. It works, superbly. Thank God for Alex G.

This fall, the Pao Arts Center is celebrating the vibrant life of Boston’s Chinatown with its first full-capacity arts festival since the pandemic. Murals fill shop windows, live performances take to the streets, and this week, the interactive Ghost Roots exhibit opens at the Pao Center galleries on Albany Street. The Crimson visited the festival for its first live concerts on Thursday, Sept. 8 and talked to Pao Arts Center’s Communications and Development Manager, Sophia Chen, about the project.
The multilingual musical performances on Thursday night showcased the excellence and rich cultural diversity of Boston’s Chinatown. Chen, who only began working for Pao five months ago, described how the organization has done so since its humble beginnings.
“When I first moved to Boston, they made me feel at home,” said Chen.
The Experience Chinatown festival, which started in 2017 as a one-day event, has blossomed into a three month celebration of the Boston Chinatown community. During the pandemic, when anti-Asian racism compounded the already harmful effects of COVID-19 on Chinatown, the Pao Arts Center had to be creative to hold the festival through quarantine restrictions. The stakes of cultural celebration could not have been higher.
Starting in 2020, the arts center approached Chinatown restaurants to propose a series of murals that could bring people into Chinatown for an art exhibition experienced from the safety of outdoor spaces.

This year, a record nine murals cover the storefronts of Chinatown establishments, exploring the theme of what makes a community special.
“Chinatown is more than just food,” said Chen, “it’s a living, dynamic community of people.”
Recognizing and cultivating this community, as well as empowering its artists, is what the Pao Arts Center does best. And according to Chen, this is rare.
“Finding an Asian American arts space is really really precious, especially on the east coast,” said Chen.
The three-month festival put on by the arts center has spread awareness of its mission and welcomed everyone to engage with Asian American arts.
Murals for the Experience Chinatown were installed in August and will stay up through October. The festival also celebrates the talents of local musicians, dancers, and all types of performing arts through shows throughout September.
J-pop group shiori_kubrik began these live performances with a personal set at Auntie Kay and Uncle Frank Chin Park. Concertgoers and locals enjoyed take-out meals from local Chinatown restaurants at picnic tables and danced in the streets to shiori_kubrik’s indie-electric sound.
Lyrically, the band did not hold back, singing about loss, sense of belonging, and finding hope in a modern world. Their pop sound kept the crowd energetic and set a celebratory tone for the opening concert series of the festival.
Orca Bones, a 2021 formed progressive rock duo, switched the tone of the opening night with their fresh, experimental sound.
Lead singer Jujube K. Wong distorted his guitar and vocals for a unique effect that made the band seem to double in size. Electrically manufactured harmonies and vocal reverb created the sense of phantom singers and guitar players missing from the stage. Following each song, Wong’s spoken interludes echoed and harmonized with the still-running effects.
The opening of the Ghost Roots interactive exhibition at the Pao Arts Center on Thursday, Sept. 22, featured the wide extent of culture the festival offers. Artist Soyoung L. Kim put together a multifaceted, interactive artistic experience that explores the stories of two Asian-American women. The opening event included a reception, screening, and talk to follow.
There has never been a better time to visit Chinatown. Whether you go for the murals, the shows, or the upcoming exhibition, the Experience Chinatown festival has only enhanced the already lively activities the neighborhood has to offer.

Despite the limitations of my College curriculum and concentration requirements, last semester, I managed to make time in my schedule to take Professor Kirsten A. Weld’s expansive seminar on the history of modern Mexico. We traveled back to Mexico’s colonial period, then to its independence and the tumultuous aftermath that paved the way for the Revolution in the 20th century, ending in modern-day border politics and drug organizations.
It was a rude awakening. Mexico had always been a beautiful paradise to me, with its ancient sun and mighty temples, whose watching skies led the monarchs to their autumnal home. I was told that I descended from those who built floating cities and guided the dead. We were chosen by gods. We found the eagle perched on the cactus devouring a snake. We communicated with the celestial bodies.
But the modern truth of Mexico is one of disgrace, displacement, and dismemberment.
The number of women dead at the hands of male violence has risen to epidemic levels. Femicide plagues Mexico. Every day in 2020, at least 10 women were murdered — around a third of them for their gender. The femicides only pile up higher as the years pass: From 427 reported victims in 2015, to 940 in 2020, to 1,004 in 2021, femicide has seen a 135 percent increase, with nearly one in five female homicides occurring in the home. These numbers are haunting; yet, these rates are most likely underreported, given the inaction of the Mexican government, which has failed to search for at least 20,000 women who are still missing.
Dehumanized in comparison to men, women are subject to significant violence at home. Men beat, rape, and murder their wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, and neighbors. This displacement of women’s humanity is not a uniquely Mexican invention; it is inherited from colonization by the Spanish with their masculine modes of domination. Slaughtered and tortured, Indigenous communities were dominated violently. In order to leverage any small amount of power under subjugation, Mexican men adopted the patriarchal violence that rendered women second — perpetrating European modes of domination toward their own people.
Such aggression is continuously encouraged at psychological, physical, and cultural levels against women, dismembering not only their bodies but also their selves. Even in communities where women do not fear physical harm, they are often denied the agency of their personhood. In many states in Mexico, women are legally or culturally barred from abortion and education. The gender wage gap grows significantly. Even when women manage to enter the workforce despite the obstacles, many soon come to find themselves punished for pursuing motherhood. Indigenous women receive the brunt of this gendered violence, facing domination in language, land, and labor. The personhood of women is continuously made a shadow in the colossus of the man.
The lore of La Virgen, La Malinche, and La Llorona further recognizes the cultural echoes of violence against women. A woman: immaculate, daughter of Eve, mother of Jesus, whose image was impressed upon the cloak of then-peasant Saint Juan Diego as proof of her most holy existence. A woman: traitor, lover of the white man, mother of the Mexican, whose back faced her sorrowful brethren as she forcefully sought mountains of gold with the steel-plated man. A woman: wailer, ghost of vengeance, mother of dead children, whose own children she drowned after her white lover abandoned her.
The Mexican woman is expected to be pure like La Virgen, yet a passive subject of violence like La Malinche, all while suffering in perpetuity like La Llorona. Chingada, “fucked” in Spanish. Chingar, “fuck” in Spanish. Chingón, “macho man” in Spanish. The writing is on the wall about the behavior of men towards women: It is an act of violence from men that turns into an act of violation for women.
This is not an indictment of Mexican men. They, too, have suffered beneath the violent colonial modes of domination. It is a call for help, an echo of the work being accomplished in Mexico today by women and other organizers alike. While women are being killed and the world watches, mothers and families are mobilizing in their name to unite the body and self once more, to return humanity to women and demand the end of violence against them.
Violence is not unknown to women in the United States of America. But it would be historically inaccurate to claim that white women are subject to the same violence that non-white women are, today and in the past. When I look around at the women at Harvard, I see mostly white. They are strangers to the violence happening in Mexico — the violence happening to women like them, but not like them.
I ask myself why my sisters are not worthy of their mercy. I write this piece standing in front of a grave of murdered Mexican women, whose deaths bear heavy on my hesitating soul. I dedicate this Hispanic Heritage Month to these women, documenting their humanity to the world with the words of this piece.
End all violence against women, in Mexico and everywhere else. My mothers, sisters, daughters, and neighbors: Rest in Mercy.
Brian Baltazar Pimentel ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, is an English concentrator in Eliot House.
This piece is part of a focus on Hispanic authors and experiences for Hispanic Heritage Month.

Around 100,000 LGBTQ+ students currently attend private colleges in the United States that have received a religious exemption from Title IX. By petitioning the Department of Education, colleges may receive these religious exemptions, exemptions that allow these institutions to reject, deny resources to, or expel students for their sexuality or gender identity, all while continuing to receive federal funding.
But the battle over these religious exemptions started several decades before courts started defining sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes in the 2010s. It started when Bob Jones University had its federal funding withheld due to a different policy monitoring its students’ romantic lives — a policy that university President Bob Jones III had apparently ended just hours before being asked to defend it on Larry King Live in 2000.
“We stand against the one-world government, against the coming world of anti-Christ, which is a one-world system of blending of all differences,” said Jones, defending his university’s right to ban interracial dating. “The Bible is very clear about this.”
“There is a religious freedom issue,” he added. “That’s all we ever fought for.”
This supposed Biblical clarity was the grounding for the policy in 1970 as well, when the IRS stripped BJU of its tax-exempt status over the ban. In response, outrage from the religious right coalesced into political groups such as the Moral Majority, whose platforms have come to define the American religious right.
The Supreme Court upheld the IRS’s decision in 1983 in Bob Jones University v. United States. But tasked with evaluating discrimination based on sexuality a few decades later, they had seemingly changed their tune.
It is against this backdrop that we find ourselves today. In 2018, the City of Philadelphia was contracting with several outside groups to place children in foster homes. Upon learning that two groups, including Catholic Social Services, had been violating nondiscrimination laws by refusing to place children with same-sex couples, the city ended their contract. Claiming their religious freedom had been violated, Catholic Social Services sued.
In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against the city in Fulton v. Philadelphia. Under this decision, discrimination against same-sex couples was no longer a disqualifier in receiving federal funds, and discriminatory institutions were now constitutionally protected against being held to the letter of the law.
The Fulton decision was painful for many, especially for queer people like myself, but it was hardly unexpected. The decision fell right in line with the court’s 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado, which said that a business owner had the constitutional right under the Free Exercise Clause to deny service to a gay customer exclusively because of their sexuality. Increasingly, it seems, the Supreme Court values the right to discriminate more highly than the right not to be discriminated against.
And for religious colleges, exemptions have been baked into Title IX since its conception in 1972. The statute, which banned discrimination based on sex, would later be interpreted to include gender identity and sexuality, preserving the religious exemption in both of those cases. During the years immediately before and after the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, the number of colleges applying for these exemptions skyrocketed. Now the number of colleges with these exemptions stands at over 200, including fundamentalist colleges of all denominations, such as Bob Jones University.
Title IX is not the only federal statute to have its power stunted by the religious right. First codified by McClure v. Salvation Army, religious groups are also exempt from Title VII, a clause which forbids discrimination in hiring on the grounds of race, religion, gender, and other protected classes. In 2012, the Supreme Court held that this exception allowed a church school to fire Cheryl Perich when she was diagnosed with narcolepsy. In 2021, the Seventh Circuit Court held that churches were also immune from workplace harassment claims after Sandor Demkovich was harassed, and ultimately fired, for his sexuality.
In their efforts to make America an exclusively Christian country, Christian Nationalists consistently argue that these broad exemptions are simply protections of their religious freedom to practice Christianity as they see fit. But as decades of legal precedent has shown, the inevitable consequence of both their actions and their ideology is to prioritize traditionally privileged groups, returning to straight, white, able-bodied, Christian men the oppressive powers rightfully stripped from them by civil rights laws. Freedom to them means the power to deprive the marginalized of their freedoms. And thanks to these cases, that power is growing every year.
These cases should challenge us to ask a foundational question of ourselves: if we believe that discrimination is bad, why we would allow it in any circumstance? In most cases, explicit discrimination against someone for their gender, sexuality, race, religion, or ability is rightfully outlawed. But religious institutions have been given significant latitude to discriminate explicitly, legally allowed to flout nondiscrimination laws while being constitutionally protected against being deprived of public funds.
Great acts and decisions that have driven our country forward have never been without controversy. Laws that protected civil rights, legal precedents that banned discrimination, and public statements that shifted the course of American history were undeniably acts of great political courage precisely because they were often unpopular with large swaths of the country. To say that we condemn bigotry in some cases, but not all, is an act of political cowardice.
It is people of color, LGBTQ+ people, disabled people, and women who suffer whenever these exemptions are invoked, and these groups will continue to suffer unless the laws designed to protect them are allowed to fulfill their full purpose. Bigotry is bigotry, and if we do not fight it wherever we see it, we are not fighting it at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot has changed since 2020 — we have cautiously put Covid-19 past us, yet another Harvard shop has tragically replaced the Harvard Square Starbucks, and so on and so forth. But this fall, just like the Starbucks that is set to return to the Square in November, some fixtures from the past have resurfaced — and unlike the holiday-flavored drinks we’re sure to enjoy come wintertime, they leave us with a decidedly sour taste in our mouths.
The figure in question: former Government preceptor David D. Kane, whose employment at Simmons University recently made headlines. In fall 2020, Kane came under fire for moderating the website “EphBlog” and allegedly authoring racist posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” — posts which, among many other horrific claims, disputed the worthiness of Black students at elite institutions and complained about the criticisms against a literal neo-Nazi organization on Williams’ campus.
This fall, two years after the scandal that led to the end of his contract at Harvard, Kane was hired as a section instructor for the course Statistics 118: “Introductory Statistics” at Simmons University. What happened next was eerily similar to the situation that unfolded at Harvard: Simmons students, having discovered the allegations against their new instructor, protested Kane’s hiring by confronting Kane about the EphBlog posts and dropping out of his section. Less than two weeks into the semester, Simmons University canceled Kane’s class after its enrollment numbers dipped below the minimum threshold and subsequently announced that his contract with Simmons would not be renewed.
In a statement, Simmons Interim Provost Russell Pinizzotto wrote that Kane’s blog posts “did not surface” during the hiring process. We are not quite sure why that was the case: Information on controversies surrounding David Kane’s moderation of EphBlog and alleged authorship of its highly discriminatory content can be easily found with a quick Google search. At best, this indicates porous hiring protocols in need of review; at worst, this signals willful negligence of an institutional commitment to inclusivity.
Given this oversight, we are glad that Kane is no longer teaching for the foreseeable future — a measure which is rightfully owed to the Simmons students who spoke out to protect their campus community and to deny someone with allegedly racist views a platform and authority as an instructor on campus. To the students who tipped the Simmons Voice, protested, and confronted Kane during class: We commend and applaud you for your hard work and courage.
Historically, student activism has propelled meaningful action on campuses across the country and around the world. Just as students have entered institutions and inherited some of their legacies, students have also stepped up to create new chapters in university (and even global!) narratives. Student journalists have, in many instances, played a crucial role in such student activist initiatives by keeping the student body informed of major campus issues and by holding university administrations accountable. Our colleagues at The Crimson certainly have done so, but more broadly, we commend every student journalist (yes, even our colleagues at the Yale Daily News) committed to truth-seeking and accountability. In this case, it was reporting by student journalists at the Simmons Voice that brought accusations against Kane and his capacity as an instructor to question.
As we praise Simmons students for their valiance, we sympathize with them for having to go out of their way to make the Simmons campus a safe, welcoming, and inclusive space — a responsibility that lies in great part with the university administration, and one which was evidently neglected in the hiring of Kane. Placing the burden on students to opt out of courses taught by faculty who allegedly hold discriminatory views reflects not only questionable professional standards for what constitutes ethical and responsible pedagogy but also a degree of institutional apathy that has tangible, damaging effects on students.
Many universities, Harvard and Simmons included, have pledged an institutional commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We wish to remind universities writ large that such commitments require proactive and continuous action in order for such words to function as more than disingenuous PR stunts. DEI is not some abstract, unattainable ideal that universities can only strive toward but never achieve. As we have opined before, initiatives such as multicultural centers, more consistent and thorough Title IX policies, better accessibility accommodations, and financial aid programs that cultivate socioeconomic diversity are all steps universities can pursue to actualize their DEI statements. At the same time, we encourage university administrators to demonstrate their institutional commitments to DEI through a review of preexisting policies and protocols — including, as this case makes painfully clear, the hiring process for new instructors.
Students' concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus point to a fundamental concern about their sense of belonging. This issue is directly connected to academic excellence: Rigorous and earnest intellectual engagements that further university missions to educate the next generations of citizens and produce worthwhile knowledge cannot happen when students feel unwelcome and unsafe. But as students who have felt the same pain, hurt, and confusion as those blindsided by this instance of institutional neglect at Simmons, we believe the most important argument here is moral: Time and time again, a lack of attention to DEI — at Harvard and elsewhere — has inflicted mental, physical, and emotional harms upon students that are, quite plainly, wrong.
Separated by two years and approximately 2.8 miles, the harm of Kane’s scandal-inducing presence at Harvard and Simmons has transgressed the space-time continuum in a rerun of the past that the physics of proper attention to DEI would have prevented. Some unexpected visitors from 2020 are more than welcome; we’ll keep the Peppermint Mochas and holiday-themed cups. But out of concern for the well-being of all our fellow students, we hope we never wake up to another student newspaper headline about Kane again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just one short year after he left Harvard mired in scandal, David D. Kane was back and then gone once again.
Kane, once a preceptor for Government 50: “Data” at Harvard, left the University in fall 2020 after allegations arose that he had authored a series of racist blog posts under a pseudonym and his contract was not renewed. Barely a year later, Kane was poised to make his return to teaching at nearby Simmons University earlier this fall until students, with the help of excellent student journalism from the Simmons Voice, discovered his checkered past. Protests ensued, and Kane’s class was canceled due to plummeting enrollment. His contract will not be renewed.
This Editorial Board has spoken before on the strength of the allegations against Kane, condemning the unacceptable harm his alleged posts caused Black students. Now, as then, we remain displeased with the failure of universities to properly vet instructors before hiring them. In this matter, however, we choose to write in dissent to emphasize that university hiring procedures do not exist in a vacuum; rather, they are another point in a continuum of failed practices that, year after year, tolerate foul misconduct by professors while forcing students to bear the consequences alone.
This latest episode in the David Kane saga speaks to a culture of negligence in higher education around issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion that extends far beyond the hiring process. There is a long, ugly history of Harvard and other universities failing to decisively address misconduct by professors. This latest instance shows vividly how such dereliction of duty, particularly by an institution with the power and prestige to make change, allows the rot to fester across academia.
When Simmons hired Kane, they failed to protect their students by failing to conduct a  background check thorough enough to turn up the well-publicized controversy surrounding EphBlog. Universities must carefully investigate the instructors they hire — student safety demands it. Harvard’s own failures to do so reek of negligence: For example, a new lawsuit claims that Harvard was warned of allegations of sexual misconduct against John L. Comaroff but went ahead in hiring him as a professor of Anthropology regardless. Lo and behold, he now faces numerous accusations of the same kind. In the matter at hand, just one Google search would have been enough to avoid exposing Simmons’ students to Kane. To that extent, Simmons failed.
But the blame for Kane’s return and the harm it caused lies primarily with Harvard. The very first time misconduct harmful to students occurs, the administration should respond forcefully. When the misconduct is as severe as Kane’s was alleged to be, the instructor should be fired. Information on the fireable offenses should be provided when potential future employers ask for employment records or references. There is no argument for universities to keep information on this sort of misconduct from future employers who could use that information in making their own hiring decisions. As a highly influential figure in academia, Harvard has immense power here to prevent noxious instructors from spreading their vitriol to other institutions. They didn’t with Kane, and Simmons students paid the price.
As students at Harvard, we know that our institution commands power. We want Harvard to use that power to prevent every possibility of future abuse of students by instructors. As a leader among its peer universities, Harvard can and should prevent harm.
Instead, deep institutional negligence means that right now such harm regularly begins at Harvard or is propagated through it. Our University fails to create decisive, forceful, thorough structures to deal with misconduct, sweeping incidents under the rug and allowing bad apples to fester at our University and now at others.
We want prevention at the moment that misconduct occurs — not one career appointment later. No more situations like those of Roland G. Fryer, Jr., Jorge I. Domínguez, or John L. Comaroff, where reports of harmful misconduct built and built before the administration stepped in. It does not escape us that, as we write this, two of those three men continue to teach students. It also does not escape us that a lawsuit by three graduate students against Harvard alleging gross negligence in Title IX arbitration rages on, now with support from the Department of Justice.
Harvard should use its reputation amongst universities to remove rot as soon as it’s discovered. The longer it fails to do so, the deeper the blight of misconduct will fester and spread. Students, for want of a Google search, will continue to suffer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven individuals — including basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and actress Laverne Cox — will be awarded the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal, Harvard’s highest honor in the field of African and African American studies, next month.
The awards will be handed down by Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, which announced the recipients last Wednesday.
Five others will receive the honor at an award ceremony next month: Award-winning author and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, arts patron and philanthropist Agnes Gund, Citigroup executive Raymond J. McGuire ’79, former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and pioneering artist Betye Saar. The ceremony will be held on Oct. 6 in Sanders Theatre.
Abdul-Jabbar is the National Basketball Association’s all-time leading scorer and the only six-time Most Valued Player in league history. Since retiring from the court, Abdul-Jabbar has been a prolific cultural critic, writing several books on African-American history and serving as a U.S. Cultural ambassador under President Barack Obama. In 2016, former President Obama awarded Abdul-Jabbar the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.
Cox, the first transgender actress to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, is a prominent LGBTQ+ rights activist. Since rising to fame for her performance in Netflix’s hit show “Orange is the New Black,” Cox has been nominated for Emmys in four of the last eight years.
Hutchins Center director Henry Louis Gates Jr. praised the honorees for “their unyielding commitment to pushing the boundaries of representation and creating opportunities for advancement and participation for people who have been too often shut out from the great promise of our times."
This year’s slate of honorees is the first since 2019. The Hutchins Center did not award the medal during the pandemic.
The Du Bois Medal, first presented in 2000, honors its namesake, the pre-eminent African American scholar and civil rights activist. Du Bois graduated from Harvard College in 1890 and became the first African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895.
Past honorees include Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, former U.S. Congressman John R. Lewis, author and civil rights activist Maya Angelou, talk show host and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey, and former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since N.P. “Narv” Narvekar took charge of Harvard’s investments in December 2016, he has avoided a year of negative returns, something his two immediate predecessors could not.
That could soon change.
Last year, Harvard’s endowment soared to its highest ever value, $53.2 billion, after it reported a whopping 33.6 percent return on its investments in fiscal year 2021. But with high inflation and rising interest rates rattling financial markets, the Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm, could be on the brink of delivering its first negative annual returns in five years.
Financial experts say the turbulent market conditions have likely caused Harvard’s investments to struggle over the past fiscal year.
“It has been a challenging fiscal and calendar year for most asset classes,” Rutgers Business School professor John M. Longo wrote in an email. “I would be surprised to see Harvard or any large endowment generate meaningful positive returns in the current reporting cycle.”
The Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service estimates that the median university endowment fell by 10.2 percent during the past fiscal year, which ended on June 30.
HMC has not reported a negative return on its investments since fiscal year 2016, when the endowment lost almost $2 billion in value.
Since then, HMC has undergone sweeping structural changes, spearheaded by Narvekar, who arrived in December 2016.
Narvekar instituted a five-year restructuring plan that moved the endowment away from its “hybrid” investment model, under which HMC retained a large in-house investment staff while also hiring external fund managers to oversee portions of its assets. Since the completion of the plan in 2020, the vast majority of the University’s investments have been externally managed.
Harvard’s endowment is heavily skewed toward alternative investments, such as private equity and hedge funds. In fiscal year 2021, HMC invested 34 percent of the endowment in private equity funds and 33 percent in hedge funds.
It remains unclear whether the composition of Harvard’s endowment will help or hurt its performance.
New York University finance professor David L. Yermack ’85 said he believes alternative investments will cause university endowments to perform worse than funds that hold more stocks and bonds, such as pension funds.
“It’s been a bad year for everybody, but the people with the more non-traditional investments are going to get hurt worse,” said Yermack, a former Crimson managing editor.
But he added that private equity managers have “a lot of wiggle room” in interpreting the value of the companies in their portfolios, which could skew the figures that schools ultimately report.
“My own feeling is that these markets have dropped a great deal, but the investment managers are going to be very reluctant to admit that and will probably be rather cautious in writing down the value of their investments,” he said. “But I think it’s going to be hard to defend any estimate that isn’t pretty negative in these asset classes, on the order of maybe a 20 percent drop.”
Other experts, however, said HMC’s tendency toward alternative investments may work in its favor. Harvard Business School professor Luis M. Viceira said HMC’s investments in hedge funds are designed to “cushion” losses in other parts of its portfolio.
“We hope that the hedge fund side of the portfolio is doing the job and helping to smooth out any falls in valuations and any negative returns probably the endowment is going to experience on the equity side — which is the largest side of the investments,” he said.
Ultimately, experts said, a likely decline in HMC’s investment performance during the past fiscal year is more a reflection of market conditions than bad strategy.
“They did well last year and crowed about it,” Charles A. Skorina, the head of a finance executive search firm, said. “This year, they’re going to have to say, ‘Oops, guess we didn’t do so well — because the market tanked.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives from the Dean of Students Office reaffirmed the independence of the Harvard Undergraduate Association in a Monday interview amid controversies surrounding the student government’s early months.
The results of the HUA’s first-ever referendum were voided last week because the organization had not yet appointed an election commission. HUA leadership had initially said the DSO would fulfill the role of the election commission until its formal appointment.
Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason Meier, who serves as the primary advisor to the HUA, said the DSO provides guidance to the newly-formed body but does not make decisions on its behalf.
“If staff people are making decisions about elections, it ceases to be student-led, student-run, for students, by students,” he said.
“We're not here to make decisions,” Meier added. “If someone had challenged the election results, it would not be our place to interpret that — that's the role of an election commission.”
The move to void the referendum results drew criticism from students who saw it as another delay to the creation of an HUA diversity, equity, and inclusion team. The HUA came under fire last week when Harvard Primus — a campus group for first-generation, low-income students — publicly alleged the HUA had rejected its proposal for a diversity, equity, and inclusion team.
HUA Co-Presidents Lylena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24 refuted Primus’s allegations, saying they hesitated to hold a referendum in the fall to create a new team because an incoming DEI officer would only be eligible to serve for one semester.
In the interview, Meier said the HUA currently handles diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts through its well-being team.
“DEI is enshrined in the constitution of the HUA, in particular, through the work of the well-being team. So that was something that the entire student body voted upon in the spring,” Meier said. “Where the HUA is trying to be thoughtful is that intersection of how do we have a constitutional referendum and an election and honor the timeline that the constitution has laid forth.”
Meier said his role is to ensure the student government continues to “honor” the HUA constitution and assist in financial management.
“We have been working pretty steadily to make sure that we're not just honoring the HUA’s constitution, but also the audit,” he said. “The HUA has begun to work more closely with the departmental administrator and Student Engagement to make sure that these financial transactions are correct.”
The HUA’s predecessor, the Undergraduate Council, was audited by the Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services earlier this year due to allegations of financial mismanagement. The audit did not “find evidence of any financial irregularities,” according to the initial report released in March.
Representatives from the DSO also discussed the following topic:
Harvard College Faith and Action
Students have criticized Harvard College Faith and Action, a Christian campus group, for alleged discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.
Students in Lowell House publicly condemned HCFA over the house’s unmoderated student email list earlier this month. Estabine, the HUA co-president, drew censure from students after her public defense of HCFA over the email list.
When asked about the controversy, Associate Dean for Inclusion & Belonging Alta Mauro said that she “would absolutely encourage” students to speak out about any bias or discrimination they face.
“The [Harvard] Foundation is one of those spaces across the College that has a link to the bias reporting form on its website — I actually triage the bias response line,” Mauro said. “I do have formal processes of liaising with colleagues in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences or in other places."
“We are communicating early and often when there is an allegation of bias or discrimination involving a Harvard College student,” she added.

Harvard professors and researchers discussed the role memes played in former President Donald Trump’s success in 2016 during a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Monday.
Garrett M. Graff ’03 — director of cyber initiatives at Aspen Digital — moderated the panel, which featured Gabriella Coleman, a Harvard professor of anthropology; Joan Donovan, a research director at the Shorenstein Center; Emily Dreyfuss, a senior managing editor of the Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change Project; and Brian Friedberg, a senior researcher at the Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change Project.
Donovan launched the event by discussing the effects of the commercialization of the internet, which she said led to diminished privacy and increased dependence on the virtual world.
“We could say the internet became a problem the first time someone bought a pizza on dominos.com,” Donovan said. “That layer of commerce online moves us away from this free space of information.”
The internet’s ability to track consumers across apps and search engines using their personal and financial information coupled with society’s increasing dependence on the internet has led to what some scholars describe as “surveillance capitalism,” according to Donovan.
“It could just be capitalism,” Donovan added. “But by and large, we’re dealing with a system that is a bit of a trickster in the sense that it is many things to different people.”
For President Trump, the internet was a place where he found some of his earliest supporters.
Dreyfuss said a fringe internet movement that promoted its causes through popular culture and memes quickly embraced Trump because “he was and remains almost the perfect archetype of a meme leader.”
“His hair was already a meme,” Dreyfuss said. “He stood for a certain kind of New York wealth, and power and masculinity to these communities, and then he also swore and was not appropriate and did crazy things.”
While the members of this fringe movement did not all share political views and beliefs, they collectively embraced Trump because he was “willing to trouble the system and push the limits of the system,” Dreyfuss said.
Far right-wing political operatives like Steve Bannon and Roger Stone also identified that Trump could appeal to those who felt disenfranchised by mainstream political movements, according to Dreyfuss.
“They understood that he would be catnip to these alternative media systems and to these folks who wanted something different,” she said. “So they played them.”
Donovan said Trump’s success is also attributable, in part, to “a major unraveling of the DNC.”
“You had the birth of PizzaGate, which is a vehicle for getting people to pay attention to the Podesta emails,” she said, referring to a conspiracy theory that developed from leaked emails belonging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager.
While Clinton’s campaign was consumed with controversy, it lacked the virality that seemed to follow Trump.
“Hillary Clinton was not memorable, nor was she meme savvy,” Donovan said.
Since Clinton’s loss in 2016, the Democratic Party has increasingly embraced the use of memes in political campaigns. John K. Fetterman, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate running for Senate in Pennsylvania, has gained attention for his social media accounts, which adopt memes and pop culture trends.
But Dreyfuss cautioned against the Democrats embracing meme wars as an effective political strategy for winning elections.
“Ideally, the meme wars would not be what drives our politics,” Dreyfuss said.
