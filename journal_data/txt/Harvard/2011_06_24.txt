After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BEIJING—On June 7, I visited Beijing’s Temple of Confucius. Generations of scholars have paid their respects to the ancient temple, which houses slates bearing the names of those who passed the Imperial Examinations. As I walked around, silently begging for better rote memorization abilities, I caught sight of a middle-aged woman audibly crying and praying in front of a large statue of Confucius, which had been adorned with red prayer tablets by students hoping for supernatural academic assistance.
June 7 also happened to be the start of the annual two-day long National Higher Education Entrance Examination or, as it is more colloquially called, the Gao Kao. According to an article in The Global Times, praying at the temple of China’s most famous scholar continues to be a popular Gao Kao preparation method. So I decided to interview several of my Chinese teachers—themselves recent college or graduate school graduates—about their Gao Kao experiences.
The exam is given once a year, and an individual’s Gao Kao score remains the sole factor for admission to the majority of Chinese institutions of higher education. According to estimates from 2009, only three out of five students achieve a score high enough to attend college.
Though daunting, the Gao Kao has practical advantages. It guarantees that each applicant possesses a baseline standard of knowledge. It provides a quantitative measure for the college admissions process, sidestepping the difficult process of assessing the relative merits of extracurriculars and recommendation letters. Indeed, people I spoke with expressed a strong belief that a more holistic admissions process would not work with China’s astonishing glut of applicants.
But people I interviewed also mentioned the test’s disadvantages. They were quick to stress the particular form of anxiety caused by having your entire academic career and intellectual ability reduced to a single score.
Yet, most surprising to me was their strong belief in the fairness of the Gao Kao despite its reductive nature. With emphasis on catching cheaters (this year, Xinhua reported that 62 people were detained for suspected cheating before the test even began), admissions standards that vary by province, and the controversial addition of extra points for ethnic minorities, the government strives to provide an equal opportunity testing environment. But within provinces, disparities in income and access to educational resources affect students’ performance. Given the simplicity of the admissions process, there are fewer opportunities to examine or offset these factors than there are in a more holistic system.
Several experts have been critical of how the process has given way to dramatic stratification within the Chinese higher education system. Graduates from a few select universities enjoy a high status in China, but the job market has become increasingly dire for those who did not attend such schools. Indeed, the downside to the impressive pervasiveness of higher education in China is the devaluation of higher degrees from universities that are less selective. A study conducted last November found that the average college graduate makes only 300 more yuan per month than the average migrant worker.
In this high stakes climate, Chinese and American media alike have cast light on the extreme measures some parents take to ensure their only child’s acceptance into a top university. Memorably, last year there were reports of parents providing their children with oxygen masks in the hopes of improving their concentration.
Indeed, given the very real importance of the Gao Kao on the life of the average Chinese student, a mother resorting to faith or superstition is comprehensible. And while the government has announced plans to reform Gao Kao—in some cases by allowing students to retake certain sections—the pressure on children and parents remains immense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
FLORENCE, Italy—Thirsty, I exited Florence’s Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, home to works by Botticelli and Brunelleschi. I crossed the beautiful piazza to a collection of kiosks, where I was immediately confronted with four of Europe’s most popular exported beers. Then, a fifth option, a wild card straight out of the universe of “The Simpsons”: Duff.
As a lifelong fan of America’s favorite cartoon family, I jumped at the chance to sample the mythical brew that Homer immortalized as “the beer that makes the days fly by” and “the only beer for me, smooth creamy Duff.”  Indeed, the bottle in my hand professed to be “The Legendary Duff Beer.”
Nevertheless, my Florentine encounters with Duff were only beginning. In the world-famous Ponte Vecchio Market, Duff Brewery sweatshirts were sold alongside Universita di Firenze apparel and the jerseys of Italian soccer heroes. Duff was everywhere—in supermarkets, in bars, on tacky merchandise. Florence was a pelvic-thrusting Duffman and a belching Barney away from Duff Gardens.
Motivation for the Duff fetish—other than manipulation of American college students like myself—is unclear. I doubt Duff beer is popular among local Florentines, and the beer’s label reveals that it is brewed in Germany, not Italy.
But during my 16 years living in Europe, I’d never come across it. Though friends of mine have since claimed to have “seen it around,” there certainly seems to be an abnormal concentration of Duff in Florence.
Further research reveals that Duff’s link to the Italian city may reach deeper than the wallets of enthusiastic Simpsonites. Among Florence’s 29 sister cities is none other than Cambridge, Mass. There, “Simpsons” co-creators Al E. Jean ’81 and Mike L. Reiss ’81 met as freshmen at Harvard in Holworthy Hall, where Conan C. O’Brien ’85, a future “Simpsons” writer, would later live.
Before my trip to Florence, I never really understood the meaning of “sister city.” Nor did I understand why Florence’s parents felt the need to have 30 children—at the very least they could have mixed it up with a son here and there.
Then I looked it up. As it turns out, a “sister city” promotes cultural and commercial ties with its counterpart. The Florence-Cambridge connection makes a lot of sense once you think about it. There are few commodities that carry as much cultural and commercial significance as Duff beer.
However, the smooth and creamy brainchild of Cambridge’s 80s luminaries was lost somewhere in the cultural exchange. It only took a few sips to realize that Duff was a disappointment, slotting in a couple notches below Heineken and thirty notches above Keystone Light.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina—The customs official said only one thing to me: “Good luck out there.”
“Hola senorita. Querias tomar un taxi? Por favor. Ay senorita!” I avoided eye contact with all ten of them and walked outside to find a real taxi. I finally found one—an old man wearing a Marquez jacket, who not only helped me find the Internet booth, but also gave me personal advice on how to exchange money in the city
We walked through the parking lot and finally came to the taxi. My heart, after all its pride and exaltation in having navigated so far without getting ripped off or raped, fell apart when I saw his car: a 1965 rustic tank with flaking green paint and taped windows, the remains of some once vibrant machine that had left behind its sagging bones. Before I knew it, he had put my luggage in the truck, and we were zooming down the highway towards San Telmo.
The car only broke down once. With the help of two strange cars which helped push the taxi into life again, several wrenches, the love of "el padre," and seventy dollars, I survived my first taxi ride and arrived at the steps of my apartment on Chacabuco Street.

This year’s incoming MBA class at the Harvard Business School will have a greater percentage of women than ever before, according to preliminary statistics released by the school.
Of the 918 students in the MBA Class of 2013, 39 percent will be female. In the two previous classes, women comprised 36 percent of the enrolled students.
Additionally, the Class of 2013 will see greater representation from students with backgrounds in science, engineering, and manufacturing, leading to fewer students in that class hailing from consulting and finance.
The shifts have been part of a change in strategy on the part of the Business School to attract a more diverse student body.
"This admissions strategy has evolved over the last several years of trying to find ways to increase diversity—including gender, race, ethnicity, professional and academic background—without decreasing quality in order to improve the overall educational experience for everyone in the class," Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny said in a statement.
A quarter of the incoming class will have had backgrounds in financial services, venture capital, and private equity, compared to 32 percent of the Class of 2012. Meanwhile, students with backgrounds in health care, biotechnology, communications, and manufacturing will comprise 29 percent of the class.
In addition, the percent of students with undergraduate degrees in science and engineering is increasing from 33 percent to 36 percent.
"We think they bring an interesting voice into classroom,” said Deirdre C. Leopold, managing director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid. “To be in a case method classroom, where you need to be able to learn to communicate and be persuasive, is a really good sort of complement to the kind of hard analytical skills that these people learned in undergrad.”
The admission and yield rates have remained relatively constant in recent years. 12 percent of 9,134 applicants were admitted to the Class of 2013, compared with 11 percent of 9,524 applicants for 2012. The yield rate rose slightly from 89 percent to 90 percent.
The Business School has no fixed targets when it comes to industry, geographical, or gender representation, Kenny said.

Amidst accusations in a recently published report that Harvard is investing in a “land-grabbing” hedge fund, experts in the field are questioning the document's accuracy.
According to the Oakland Institute, the Harvard Management Company, which oversees Harvard’s nearly $30 billion endowment, has invested $500 million in London-based Emergent Asset Management, a hedge fund that specializes in the agricultural industry.
The report alleges that Emergent and other funds like it have forced villagers off their land, leaving farmers with little land to grow crops. Additionally, many on-site investors have been granted eased restrictions on natural resource consumption, which can lead to price volatility and supply shortages in commodity markets and strains on the local natural environment.
According to Oakland Institute Executive Director Anuradha Mittal, individuals close to Emergent described Harvard as the "cornerstone" investor. The report also names Vanderbilt as another prominent university involved in these alleged land grabs.
“Investors such as university endowments are being lured by promises of high returns—between 20 to 30 percent—promised by private equity and hedge funds investing in land in Africa,” Mittal said.
The report said that these funds advertise developing the land, but Mittal said that they often just hold the land as prices rise with increased demand for real estate. According to the report, the land is also often used for export commodities, such as biofuels and cut flowers.
Emergent has strongly criticized the report, calling it a “catalogue of inaccuracies.”
“We … enhance the local infrastructure and provide services to the community, helping, for example, with accommodation, water delivery, electricity and health support service,” Emergent wrote in a statement.
Harvard spokesperson John Longbrake declined to comment, saying that HMC does not publicly discuss its investments.
Kennedy School Professor Calestous Juma, who has worked with African nations in developing land investment policies, said that this characterization—even the labeling of these programs as “land grabs”—can “demonize” these development initiatives.
“My concern is that when you see everything that is involved in investments in Africa as being described as ‘land grabbing,’ it is a type of demonization—and it might stop these necessary foreign-direct investments altogether,” Juma said. “This does not mean that there are no crooks—there are a lot of bad deals—but it would be unfortunate for the entire enterprise to be prohibited.”
Juma, who was born in Kenya and grew up near Lake Victoria said he was skeptical that the funds in question investments are doing the type of damage the report describes. Juma added that the report does spur discussion on the topic.
“We would like to talk more about welcoming investments in agriculture and not just purchasing land,” said Juma.
Juma repeatedly said that governments “have a strategy behind” these investments. “This isn’t some sort of colonization,” he said.
