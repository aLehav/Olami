After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, March 29, we opened the front doors of University Hall to let in around 50 students to occupy the building. For eight hours, we waited outside administrators’ offices, calling for an end to Harvard’s complicity in the sexual violence crisis on campus.
By far the largest symbol of this complicity is Harvard’s response to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Professor John L. Comaroff. An ongoing lawsuit by survivors of Comaroff’s alleged abuse seeks to prove that the University violated the survivors’ rights at multiple points throughout their Title IX investigations, including by illegally obtaining and sharing one survivor’s private therapy notes with Comaroff.
Harvard’s actions represent the broader failure of the University administration to take the crisis of sexual violence seriously. We occupied University Hall because of Comaroff, but also because of the myriad of cases of sexual abuse on this campus that fail to make headlines. A 2016 study found that 31 percent of all undergraduate women and 47 percent of undergraduate women involved in final clubs experienced sexual assault at Harvard; a 2019 study showed little change, with 33 percent of all undergraduate women surveyed reporting some form of nonconsensual sexual contact. To attend Harvard is to know the pain, trauma, and academic interruption that sexual violence inflicts on so many of us, especially women and queer people.
But we were not occupying University Hall just to look backwards at Harvard’s long history of injustice. In our remarks that day, our press release, and our direct conversations with College Dean Rakesh Khurana and other administrators, we outlined a vision of how Harvard could move forward. In this piece, we would like to make that vision perfectly clear. It is one characterized by optimism and urgency.
Optimism means an insistence that eradicating sexual violence is possible. Anybody involved in the fight against sexual violence — including Harvard’s administrators, employees of the University’s Office of Gender Equity, and student activists — will recognize the feeling that ending sexual violence is an insurmountable task and struggle with a sense of hopelessness.
But we contend that we must work towards a world where the number of sexual assaults is zero. We should be guided by a militant optimism, taking as our goal a complete end to sexual violence rather than a modest reduction or improved response after the fact. Anything less constitutes tacit acceptance that members of our community will experience potentially lifelong trauma and significant disruption to their education.
This is simply unacceptable. Our community needs to measure Harvard’s progress against the ambitious goal of achieving zero sexual violence, understanding that we do not yet know exactly how to get there.
While playing music, laughing, and sharing stories in the occupied University Hall, we were reminded that working towards the goal of zero can also be positive and beautiful. Ending sexual violence is an opportunity to build a better community, one rooted in care and respect. It will not be easy, nor will it be uniformly positive. But bringing our community together around this goal will generate new knowledge, new practices, and activate the creative and intellectual potential in all of us.
Abolitionist feminist Mariame Kaba has a saying: “Hope is a discipline.” Hope is not a passive feeling but an activating conviction, one we must carefully foster by taking active steps to create the world where it can be realized. Our optimism must be accompanied by urgent action.
Urgency at Harvard looks like bold, top-down leadership. During our occupation, our condition for leaving before 5 p.m. was simple: We would leave if Dean Khurana sent out a College-wide email naming sexual violence as a crisis and calling for a campus state of emergency to solve it. But by 5 p.m. and in the many days since, no email has been sent. Naming sexual violence as a crisis is a crucial first step to inspiring the urgent response it requires.
Addressing sexual violence demands a community-wide effort, with students, administrators, faculty, staff, and residential communities all actively participating in creating solutions. Strong leadership can steer such comprehensive action. During the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Harvard’s top administrators emphasized our collective responsibility in curbing the virus’s spread and transformed campus life. There is no reason why Harvard’s leadership cannot once again take decisive action to safeguard our community.
Urgency also means Harvard must accept a leadership role among universities. Harvard prides itself on leading higher education in many fields but is reticent towards leading the fight against sexual violence. Our prevention infrastructure and Title IX policies lag behind others around the nation. Universities with a fraction of Harvard’s endowment nevertheless find funds for independent rape crisis centers that provide much-needed campus advocacy in addition to resources for survivors.
Some institutions, like Antioch College, have undertaken bold, collaborative experiments in building communities to prevent sexual violence. Meanwhile, Harvard’s faculty and students are left without comprehensive recourse from the scourge of violence that happens on our very campus and to members of our own community. Those who have tried to fix the problem, like former Anthropology Department Chair Ajantha Subramanian, have left due to a lack of institutional support for their efforts.
Certainly, we must be thoughtful in the initiatives we undertake to end sexual violence. But the glacial pace of change at Harvard is inexcusable. The richest school in the world has an obligation to devote its significant resources towards leading the charge to end sexual violence on college campuses. The Harvard community, and especially Harvard’s leadership, must move with both optimism and urgency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student voting seems like the next item on the Republican Party’s hit list.
Last month, Republican legislators turned Idaho into the sixth state in which student ID cards do not qualify as a form of voter identification. In Texas, a Republican lawmaker has proposed eliminating all polling places on school campuses, citing safety concerns relating to the Uvalde school shooting — even though that attack had no relation to voting.
While many of these initiatives to hinder young voters have been unsuccessful, we are alarmed by the lengths the Republican Party is willing to go to undermine American democracy.
Campus voting obstacles are only the tip of the greater iceberg of voting restrictions. Between January and September of last year, seven states passed a total of 10 laws that make it harder to vote — the second highest number of such laws enacted in any year in the last decade. These laws prohibit mail-in drop boxes for ballots, induce voter database purges without notifying affected voters, and impede unhoused people and those living on tribal lands from exercising their right to vote.
The justification for such legislation — voter fraud — is at best a strawman. Voter fraud would be concerning if it were happening as much as peddlers of this argument would like to believe. Instead, an investigation by the Associated Press found fewer than 475 cases of voter fraud out of the 25.5 million 2020 presidential ballots cast in the six battleground states disputed by former President Donald Trump. Furthermore, it’s unclear that stringent voting laws would reduce this rare occurrence.
Instead, we believe Republican lawmakers pushing voter restrictions are simply attempting to normalize their attack on American democratic progress. The party fearmongers about non-white immigrants ‘replacing’ white Americans, when these diverse populations in fact constitute the modern American people. Its legislators ban literature and scholarship wrestling with our nation’s history, suggesting that America has always been great and does not need to improve.
Landmarks of modern American progress are crushed under the Republican Party, which provides no way forward. The party’s response to gun violence is not gun control, but the perverse exploitation of these tragedies and grieving families to justify wildly unrelated voter suppression bills at schools.
The Republican Party targets college students like us, not only because young voters lean Democratic, but also because we necessarily care about the future. Our lives are at stake — not those of senior lawmakers — in the case of future catastrophe as a result of climate mismanagement or gun violence or systemic racism. Our drive to build a better future clashes with the Republican Party’s desire to keep America in inequitable stasis.
Democratic backslides happen slowly and then all at once. We’re lucky to be in the slow stage right now, with several Republican-led voter suppression initiatives floundering. But without actively rejecting and organizing against these efforts, we risk the Republican Party sliding into fascism. One moment, it’s small-scale campus voting obstacles — the next, it’s the Jan. 6 insurrection.
The Republican Party knows how powerful young people are; that’s why they’re working to suppress us. We must band together to call for change. As voting is threatened in peer institutions around the country, Harvard should work to become a model campus for voting rights, supporting groups like Harvard Votes Challenge and making election day a University holiday.
The attempts made by Republicans to restrict voting on campuses serve only to undermine American democracy. The whole situation reeks of Machiavelli — and to be clear, Machiavelli stinks. We should leave him in the past where the Republican Party stalls, and seize the future of progress for ourselves.

Ian J. Miller is a historian studying empire and energy in modern Japan and East Asia. He is a history professor, Faculty Dean of Cabot House, and Director of Undergraduate Studies.
MMFW: I’m very curious to hear, how did you first become interested in Japanese history? 
IJM: I was lucky enough to go to a high school that taught Mandarin Chinese and Japanese, and I took them both. And because I’m a glutton for punishment, I chose Japan, because the language felt harder to me. It felt more difficult. And, as part of that young experience, I volunteered as part of a YMCA youth exchange to go work with campers at a camp on the Northern Island of Hokkaido, Camp Chimmikeppu, where I got to work with remarkable young people.
And really, my career choice, it turns out, I like to write books. It was really academic or maybe kindergarten teacher. So there’s a little bit of both in my character, which the students in Cabot House hopefully see. I love working with young people. I think they’re fascinating. There’s the kind of potential and joy and struggle and difficulty and becoming that is being young, is so powerful and full of hope. And I really enjoy that. And I learn from young people all the time. And so yeah, it started with my own schoolwork, but then became, you know, camp counselor, and then from camp counselor to professor.
MMFW: Tell me why Japan is fascinating. 
IJM: As a historian, Japan’s fascinating because it’s the world’s first non-Western, industrialized, and imperial power. And so it embodies so many of the tensions and possibilities of what it means to be in this modern world of ours.
When you stand somewhere else, you look at the world through someone else’s eyes or you work with historical documents, reading into those powerful texts, it can be empowering. Because it lets us, and hopefully lets our students, see that the world can be different, that they can change it. That we can change it. And I write mostly out of that passion.
MMFW: Your first book, “The Nature of the Beasts: Empire and Exhibition at the Tokyo Imperial Zoo,” is about Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo, which was the first modern zoo in East Asia. What do you find to be the connection between empire, colonialism, and zoos?
IJM: Zoos are microcosms of empire! They’re fascinating. They are diverse, rich with contradictions, and they are fundamentally acts of acquisition and violence.
Part of why I’m an academic, and a historian and intellectual is I love to be surprised by new ideas and new ways of seeing the world.
I love nature, I love being outside, I am a happy owner of two wonderful cats, one of them’s deaf, the other one has no teeth, and a dog named Sadie who has the world’s biggest underbite. I really love the animal world, and the kind of fecund, remarkable reality of the natural world, so that might have been part of what brought me to the topic. But then, the recognition that this place I used to go for fun was in fact a showcase of empire, a mechanism in the 19th century for demarcating and instantiating and embodying the crucial separation, in those terms, between what it meant to be human and what is meant to be animal, in the high age of Social Darwinist thought — when the separation between humans and animals was often synonymous or understood to be synonymous with the division between colonized and colonizer.
So, who would have thought? You know, a book about a zoo, and then I ended up at Harvard University.
MMFW: What’s your favorite part about being Cabot faculty dean?
IJM: That’s easy. The students. Our students are remarkable, they are bright, they are caring, they are kind, they are deeply motivated. My wife and I are proud to be deans of Cabot. We’re not the fanciest house on campus. But our house is full of remarkable staff, from our building manager and resident dean and house administrator, academic coordinator, to the HUDS staff, to our janitorial staff, to the groundskeeping staff, to the folks who care for the HVAC and keep the water running in the house. I can’t name these folks clearly enough. They are remarkable and they’re here out of acts of caring for students. I always hope that our students recognize that with a sense of gratitude. It’s humbling.
MMFW: What’s the hardest part of the job?
IJM: This is not exciting. But the reality of being a faculty dean being for both my wife and I, my wife is vice president at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. And I am a professor of History and director of undergraduate studies. Those are two demanding, more-than-full time jobs. And the faculty dean elements come on top of that work. There is no accompanying reduction in our work lives as we become faculty deans. So the hardest part of the work is time management, which I struggle with, if I’m honest.
Our students are so remarkable, and our staff is working so hard, that for us to not show up is simply not an option.
MMFW: What would you say, apart from the students, is your favorite part about the Quad, more generally?
IJM: Oh, the Quad! Its rich history as a site of contestation, resistance, inclusion, and belonging. I taught a course last semester called Quad Lab, and we rewrote the title to be “ReWriting the History of Harvard and Radcliffe.” We had a brilliant TF, Hazim Hardaman, and a collection of 12 incredibly sharp, motivated undergraduates.
We looked into the history of the Quad as a site of really embodying the best possibilities of this place at a time when women were not understood to be sufficient to the demands of a Harvard education. How ridiculous is that? We are one of three houses that claims that legacy of demonstrating the absurdity of the bigotry and misogyny behind that.
As a historian, nothing makes me prouder.
MMFW: In terms of the physical space? 
IJM: One thing I love about the Quad is that there are three houses! We share a sense of identity in that retreat. We’re Harvard’s backyard.
Right now the Quad lawn, which is right out this window, is full of undergraduates. There’s someone throwing a frisbee, there are three or four puppies running around, there’s a couple dozen students sunbathing, chilling out, studying and just hanging out. The lawn is amazing.
The Quad lets you let your guard down, lets you just be yourself, a little more than other parts of campus just by simple fact of its history and its location.
MMFW: This is kind of a funny question, take it as you will. How does Cambridge compare to Japan? 
IJM: Oh my gosh! This is arguably one of the sites in the nation with the deepest history, and even here, Cambridge is new compared to Japan. Harvard’s founding in the 17th century, that’s the tail end of the early modern period in Japan. I love the sense of historical depth you have in Cambridge, the legacy in the built environment, which is more powerful than most of Japan. Because Japan itself is subject to remarkable earthquakes, but also was subjected to bombing from the United States that leveled city after city, after city. So most of the built environment in Japan is very new, but the country itself, its history, and so on, has much much deeper history that I celebrate.
MMFW: What’s your favorite class that you’ve taught at Harvard? 
IJM: I don’t think I can choose just one, but I will say that the Quad Lab course was special.
MMFW: You mentioned on your personal website that one of your academic interests is comparative imperialism. How do you compare imperialisms? 
IJM: I would say comparative imperialisms, always plural. I find that pluralizing these complex terms, simply adding an “s” to any complicated term, allows us to think with nuance. And in my case what it allows us to do is move into the past, and into the past tense.
We must reconcile and reckon with the past, using the archives and the materials that are available to us.
MMFW: I know you’re writing this book, “Fueling Tokyo.” Are there any other upcoming projects that you’re excited about? 
IJM: A co-edited project with two younger scholars and a senior figure in my field of Japan studies and Japanese histories, a book called “Oceanic Japan,” which seeks to question the terrestrial bias of most history writing, shifting our attention from the land to the seas, which is especially important for an archipelago like Japan. But also reformulating and re-situating Japan so that it’s best understood and accurately understood as a Pacific nation, a Pacific archipelago.
MMFW: How did you and Crate meet?
IJM: We first met each other on the first day of college, on our freshman living learning dorm hall, at a place called Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, a small Quaker liberal arts school that we chose because it was full of wonderfully curious, quirky people who wanted to change the world.
We loved the place, Earlham was a powerful influence on both of us. We met that first day. We didn’t start dating immediately. We flirted a little our first semester of freshman year, and we began dating really our senior year. On New Year’s Eve of our senior year, as the clock chimed midnight, I first kissed Crate Herbert, who became my wife. She is wonderful. I adore her. I feel very lucky that we’ve been together 30 years or more, and we’ve been married more than 25 years. It’s one of the great gifts of my life. That doesn’t have to go in print, it’s just true.
MMFW: I know you both really love animals, and you have a few pets at home.
IJM:  There’s Sadie over there! Hi sweetie! Yeah! You doing okay?
MMFW: This is perhaps going to be a difficult question for you to answer, but I wonder if you have a favorite pet? 
IJM: No favorite pets, it depends on the day!
Crate, when we were younger, was a cat person, and I was a dog person. And both of us have come to love the other. Our first cat was named Gus. Gus was a huge Maine Coon cat and he would sit on your chest and purr and lick your nose. And our first dog was actually Sadie, and we got Sadie in the year I was coming up for tenure at Harvard University.
It is a very difficult period of life, and I thought, you know what? I’m finally going to get a dog.
MMFW: You offer Ph.D. general exam fields in “Global Environmental History” and “Energy History,” and you’ve touched on this a little bit, but I’m wondering if you could elucidate, what does history have to teach us about energy and the environment in the modern age?
IJM: History does two things. My work was originally was in the cultural history of empire and Japan more broadly.
But then we decided to have children, and bringing our son into the world shifted my personal politics fundamentally. When you’re lucky enough to have children, your world pivots on a new axis.
My work quickly took on a concern for the future my son would live his way into. And climate change has moved to the center of my politics, my professional practice, and my passion in the classroom is to help students understand the complexities of those problems, how we got here, and how we can hopefully unwind those issues. History of energy in particular teaches us that the energy transition, as we’re talking about it now, that we hope to institute, needs best to be understood as a revolution. This is not an incremental change that we need. We need a wholesale rethinking of our approach to infrastructure, energy and economy, with a focus on justice and equity, globally.
MMFW: Any advice you’d like to give to the students reading this article?
IJM: Oh that’s a really great question. It’s going to be really trite and cheesy, but I genuinely mean this. People don’t arrive at Harvard by accident.
College must be a place for fun, and it needs to be a place where you can make mistakes. And it’s okay. This environment is meant to be a place where you screw up.
That’s how we learn, and that’s really hard for our students, I find. That’s part of why I love the house system. The houses are a place you can be yourself, and you can blow it, and it’s okay. You’re a member of Cabot House no matter what.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 14, 2023, at 3:55 a.m.
Harvard’s Science Center Plaza and parts of the neighboring Science Center were evacuated by the Harvard University Police Department Thursday afternoon following the discovery of a suspicious bag. The bag was later deemed safe, and no explosion was reported.
“The bag at the Science Center Plaza has been deemed safe. The assessment of the situation is over. No threat to the campus. The area is opened again,” an alert through the school’s MessageMe Emergency Alert System read.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick confirmed that the package was determined to be safe.
“After a thorough investigation, the possible suspicious item has been deemed safe,” Warnick wrote in an email. “The assessment of the situation has concluded. The area has re-opened.”
In an emailed statement, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote that officers first responded to the plaza at 3:52 p.m. after a report of “a suspicious bag.”
Officers then “conducted a sweep of the area, discovered the bag, and set up a perimeter around the location of the bag.” At that point, HUPD requested the assistance of CPD’s Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit.
Warnick confirmed the department assisted in the response.
“We are supporting HUPD and have officers from our Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (Technicians and K9s) assisting following a report of a possible suspicious bag in the area of the Science Center Plaza,” Warnick wrote at the time of the incident. “The situation is being evaluated.”
The plaza was sectioned off with police tape, with officers instructing students to leave the area. Students were also evacuated from the first floor of the Science Center and its Cabot Science Library. An advisory through the University’s alert system sent at 4:47 p.m. instructed students to avoid the plaza.
“HUPD and CPD officers are at the Science Center Plaza on the report of a suspicious bag. Please avoid the area. Officers are evaluating the situation,” the alert read.
A loud noise was heard in the area at 5:34 p.m., though Catalano wrote in an email that the noise “was not an explosion,” and that it was instead produced by a water cannon. A follow-up alert indicated that loud noises in the area were due to equipment being used to assess the package.
“The assessment into the bag is still ongoing. It includes using equipment that will generate loud noises. Please continue to avoid the Science Center Plaza,” the alert read. “More information to follow.”
A photo taken by The Crimson appeared to show fireworks in the vicinity of the bag.
FBI spokesperson Kristen M. Setera said in a Thursday phone call that the FBI is unable to provide comment at this time.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Interim Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01, both present at the scene, declined to comment on the situation.
“You should refer to the information that HUPD has been communicating via MessageMe for questions about the ongoing situation,” College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo wrote in an emailed statement. “We are communicating with students and Houses about allowing interhouse dining in order to account for access to dinner for this evening.”
The potential threat disrupted several classes held in the Science Center, postponing a midterm exam for Math MB: “Introduction to Functions and Calculus II.” Freshmen, who typically eat at the adjacent Annenberg Hall, were instructed to eat at upperclassman houses instead.
Sidechat, an anonymous social media platform for students, sees widespread use on Harvard’s campus. Students falsely reported on Sidechat that the bag had exploded, including a post that appeared to show a bag detonating — but in fact depicted the use of a water cannon on the bag.
Lucy H. Vuong ’26 and Jackson T. Moody ’26, who were both in the Science Center at the time of the incident, said they monitored Sidechat for news of the situation.
“We had some vague sense of what was going on just through people updating on Sidechat — as much as you can trust rumors,” Vuong said, adding that she felt “worried and confused.”
“We kind of knew that we weren’t going to get anything official from the University until a while later,” Vuong added. “They sent out the MessageMe about them using things that might cause large noises after their purposeful detonation occurred.”
Vuong, who was on the fifth floor of the Science Center, said her class Math 99R: “Decision Theory” stalled for 10 to 15 minutes as “we tried to figure out what that detonation noise was.” During that time, Vuong said she and other students went down to a fourth floor balcony to observe.
Vuong said the possible threat factored into her decision not to eat at Annenberg Thursday evening.
“We were trying to build a robot — just building, building, building — and then we all got the text on our phones from HUPD,” said Moody, who was in the midst of his Physical Sciences 70: “Introduction to Digital Fabrication” lab on the first floor. “We were kind of freaking out because it said stay clear of that area, and we were in that area.”
Moody said his class evacuated after a student came down the hall and told them they were supposed to evacuate.
“I saw on Sidechat that the bomb blew up. Apparently that’s not true, or maybe it is true — I don’t even know,” Moody said. “There was a lot of uncertainty around what was happening, which obviously, leads to anxiety.”
Emily Parke ’24 said in an interview that her Thursday evening lab section for Life Sciences 1B: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution” was canceled.
“It’s not a huge disruption because the stuff that we’re doing in lab, I guess it can just be done on our own, but it is a two hour, 45 minute lab,” she said.
Parke said she felt there was a lack of information available to students between the alerts sent out by campus police.
“I got all my information about what happened from Sidechat, which is — I don’t know — maybe not the most reputable source,” Parke said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts in medicine and disease prevention underscored the importance of building trust in order to promote global health equitably at the inaugural Harvard Global Health Institute Symposium Wednesday.
The daylong event featured more than 20 speakers from around the world and was streamed live via Zoom.
In his keynote speech, Ahmed Ogwell Ouma — the acting director of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — shared the lessons he learned in protecting public health, with a focus on inequities in the global health system.
Ouma discussed health inequities in the global response to mpox and Covid-19.
“When an outbreak is small, as Africa, we are on our own,” Ouma said. “But when an outbreak is big, like we saw during the pandemic, the resources are forecast on other parts of the world who are better resourced.”
Ouma proposed a “new public health order” in which African nations would strengthen health workers and institutions promoting health, form health alliances with other nations that respect their priorities, and invest in domestic vaccine products and health care supplies.
The Institute also co-hosted a panel on “The Value of Planetary Health to Global Health Equity” with the Planetary Health Alliance. Featuring five panelists — including United Nations Development Programme HIV, Health, and Development Group Director Mandeep Dhaliwal and Planetary Health Alliance Founding Director Samuel Meyers — the panel addressed the connection between climate change and poor health outcomes.
Meyers pointed to food access, air and water quality, exposure to disease and extreme weather, and land habitability as factors influenced by changes in the global environment.
“All of these human caused, global environmental changes, which are accelerating, are actually interacting with each other in very complex ways that we are just starting to understand, but that affect the foundational qualities for human health and wellbeing,” Meyers said. “As a result, we are seeing growing global burdens of disease across every dimension of health.”
Another panel, titled “Community Response to Emerging Infectious Diseases” and co-hosted with the public health organization Partners in Health, described the danger that low trust in government poses to pandemic response. Discussants included Boston Public Health Commission Executive Director Bisola Ojikutu, Harvard Medical School Associate professor Joia S. Mukherjee, and Partners in Health Senior Advisor on Health Systems Strengthening Jean-Gregory Jerome.
The panelists argued that social inequities such as homelessness not only make pandemic responses more difficult but also reduce trust for such interventions.
“I think that’s part of the brutality of this emerging infectious disease global health security architecture,” Mukherjee said. “It’s clear to people in the community that you don’t really care about me, you care about you. You’re trying to protect it from coming to your doorstep.”
Ojikutu described what she said was the “enormous shift to private industry in controlling what was happening” in the American response to Covid-19.
“Public health infrastructure has been so devalued, so underappreciated for decades,” Ojikutu said. “It’s been funded to focus on disease entities as opposed to the infrastructure.”
Another panel discussed how lessons learned from the HIV epidemic could improve the fairness and efficacy of healthcare. Participants included University of Botswana professor Mosepele Mosepele, Desmond Tutu Health Foundation CEO Linda-Gail Bekker, and Cooper Smith Program Manager Maureen Luba.
The panel emphasized the need for health organizations to engage with the groups they are protecting.
Mosepele used the Botswana Presidential Covid-19 Task Force, in which members traveled far and wide and used television and radio to connect with local communities, as an example of community engagement.
“The whole idea was we could not form an appropriate, acceptable response that did not speak to the values, the expectations, the history of the people we were making the response for,” Mosepele said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard College doubles down on its restrictions for the usage of bicycles, scooters, and other micromobility devices, some undergraduates are frustrated with security and convenience challenges brought on by the policy.
The College’s 2022-23 student handbook prohibits students from riding micromobility devices — lightweight personal transportation vehicles like bicycles, roller blades, skateboards, and scooters — “in Harvard Yard, in Harvard-owned or operated buildings, or on sidewalks or other walkways.”
While the policy has been in place since the beginning of the academic year, the College has recently upped its communication and enforcement of the restrictions. A Feb. 16 weekly update email from the College reminded students to park their scooters in “an appropriate location,” and the school has also posted related flyers on the doors of classroom buildings this month.
The handbook says Harvard “is developing” a University-wide micromobility policy and refers to the Transportation Services website, which outlines rules for the placement of parked devices.
“Parked micromobility devices must not obstruct accessible pathways, building entrances/exits, driveways, fire safety equipment, or emergency egress paths,” it reads.
The policy defers to specific departments and building managers for questions of “scooter parking, charging, or overnight storage.”
Jack K. Silvers ’25, a Crimson Sports editor, said he finds the policy to be “unnecessary, harmful, and hypocritical.”
“I don’t think that scooters block entrances or exits,” he said. “I think Harvard probably just got one complaint, or someone’s scooter got stolen from inside, and then they wanted to clean up the hallways or something.”
Max H. Schermer ’24, a Crimson Design editor, said using a scooter is very helpful since he has back-to-back classes in the Science and Engineering Complex — located in Allston — and Harvard Yard.
Schermer said that he did expect the College to enact restrictions on micromobility devices due to a perceived increase in the number of scooters but “not this soon.”
“I do think that they can be a little more accommodating or at least have warned us about this because people need time to get locks,” Schermer said.
Samantha C. Sestak ’25 said she had her scooter stolen outside of the SEC after she was forced her to leave it outside without a lock.
Despite filing a police report for her stolen scooter, Sestak claimed the Harvard University Police Department told her she is unlikely to get it back.
“What the officer told me is that essentially I can count it as gone,” she said.
Before the policy was enforced, she said she had never experienced issues with storing her scooter indoors.
“I usually just try to make sure to store it not in front of entryways or places where people are walking,” she said. “As long as I’m respectful, I’ve never had any issues.”
According to public HUPD logs, seven bikes and scooters were reported as stolen between April 1 and April 12.
A spokesperson for the College said the school adapts to meet the needs of different facilities and has asked students to abide by signs posted about the policies.
Riley E. Jenne ’25 — who uses a scooter to travel between football practice, classes, and Mather House — said he has not been forced to change the use of his scooter.
“I still just bring mine inside. No one said anything to me about it. So far I’ve been fine with it,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates renewed calls for Harvard Law School professor Jody L. Freeman to step down from her position on the board of directors of ConocoPhillips following newly surfaced emails between her and a Securities and Exchange Commission official.
After an open letter by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard last month called on Freeman to resign from the oil and natural gas company’s board, Harvard faculty and HLS students have also voiced their concerns about her relationship with ConocoPhillips.
Freeman, who is co-chair of Harvard’s Presidential Committee on Sustainability and founded the Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program, has sat on the board of directors of ConocoPhillips for more than a decade and chairs the company’s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee.
Last month, the Harvard Faculty for Divestment steering committee sent a letter to University President-elect Claudine Gay and Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability James H. Stock raising the question of a potential conflict-of-interest between Freeman’s “fiduciary responsibility” to ConocoPhillips and Harvard’s climate goals, the Guardian reported April 1.
In February, the Harvard Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability awarded one of its five inaugural climate research cluster grants to a project led by Freeman. According to the Guardian, the letter calls the awarding of this grant to Freeman into question.
“The Salata Institute asserts it ‘will not accept funds from, or partner with, any company that does not share the goal of moving our global economy away from fossil fuels,’” the letter reads, according to the Guardian. “We ask: why does this policy not exclude awarding funds to a board member of one of the world’s most intransigent fossil fuel merchants?”
In a statement on her personal website, Freeman wrote that she serves on ConocoPhillips’ board of directors because of her belief in “the value of broad engagement during the energy transition.”
“My role as an independent director on the board of ConocoPhillips is about helping to advance the transition to a low-carbon economy,” Freeman wrote. “I work in my role to help the company deliver on, and strengthen, its climate commitments.”
Freeman denied that the role creates a “conflict of interest” with her work at Harvard.
“My role on the board is entirely consistent with the other work I do — teaching, researching, writing, advising, and advocating for climate policy, at Harvard and elsewhere,” Freeman wrote. “I wear one hat — as an advocate for positive change to address the climate challenge.”
In an April 11 letter addressed to Freeman, 24 of her former students in the Law School Class of 2025 urged her to resign from her position on ConocoPhillips’ board of directors.
“We are disappointed and ashamed that ConocoPhillips is capitalizing on the Harvard Law School credential to legitimize and further its legacy of corporate profiteering and destruction,” the letter reads.
The students called on Freeman to “choose a different weapon in the fight against climate change” and to align herself with “allies who truly care about making progress, not profits.”
In the statement on her personal website, Freeman wrote that she views her role on the board as a vehicle for progress.
“From my seat at the board table, I participate candidly and forcefully in discussion, introducing an important perspective that otherwise would be missing. I press for solutions and progress,” Freeman wrote. “I believe that I make a positive difference, and if I did not, I would not do this work.”
The Guardian reported on April 6 that Freeman helped facilitate a meeting via email between ConocoPhillips and John C. Coates, then set to become the acting director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporate Finance.
In the emails, Freeman vouched for two ConocoPhillips executives and failed to disclose her position at the company in the emails, signing off as a Harvard law professor, the Guardian reported.
“ConocoPhillips is widely recognized as the oil and gas industry leader on climate related disclosure,” Freeman wrote according to the Guardian.
Phoebe G. Barr ’23-’24, an organizer for Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — which separately obtained copies of the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request — said the emails are evidence of a conflict of interest between Freeman’s role at ConocoPhillips and her position at Harvard.
“We see her actively working for ConocoPhillips and on ConocoPhillips side, and so we think that this is just a greater confirmation of the problem and the conflict of interest and the fact that ultimately, Jody Freeman is working for this oil company,” she said.
In a separate statement on her personal website published April 12, Freeman defended the emails.
“I did not request or initiate any meeting. John, my Harvard Law School colleague, when he was still at Harvard, asked me to connect him to people at the company as part of his process of gathering information from all stakeholders,” Freeman wrote.
“I responded to his request and connected him to the company, introducing him to knowledgeable people there, explaining who they were,” she added.
In a statement, Coates clarified that he knew about Freeman’s role at ConocoPhillips and that he initiated the conversation, adding that Freeman did not “lobby” him or other SEC officials.
ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Richard W. Painter ’84, the former chief ethics lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office, said in an interview that “it’s okay” to get additional compensation “as a director or consulting.”
“But there needs to be a firm boundary between the university role and the private consulting,” Painter said.
Richard J. Lazarus, an HLS environmental law professor, wrote in an email to The Crimson that he perceives “absolutely no conflict of interest” regarding Freeman’s position at ConocoPhillips.
“Based on my close observations of Professor Freeman’s work on climate issues over the past dozen years here at Harvard Law School, I perceive absolutely no conflict of interest,” he wrote.
“I have never once heard Jody bend her focus or any meaningful suggestion that her service on the CP Board has limited her dedication to that mission in any way,” Lazarus wrote. “This notion that she has instead become their mouthpiece is, with all due respect, nonsense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy hosted a virtual panel on the implications of technology on ethics and human rights Thursday afternoon.
The talk is part of the ongoing series “Towards Life 3.0: Ethics and Technology in the 21st Century,” which examines emerging technologies and their impact on modern society. The event featured Steven Feldstein, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program, and was moderated by Carr Center Director Mathias Risse and Sarah Hubbard, a fellow of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Feldstein opened the event by discussing the increased use of digital tools, such as online surveillance and censorship techniques, by political leaders to control digital communications. According to Feldstein, these tools offer built-in advantages for leaders to exploit.
“There’s a lower prospect for public backlash,” Feldstein said. “And over the long term, there tends to be lower cost associated with this type of surveillance or censorship techniques versus traditional methods.”
When asked about solving ethical issues in technology, Feldstein said “the problem isn’t really technological — even though it is technology, we tend to think about solutions in terms of what kind of fixes can we make.”
“I think a better analogy is arms control,” he added.
Feldstein suggested that penalizing intelligence firms from developing spyware could be a solution to “help cut down to the most sophisticated military grade technology.”
Besides concerns with big data, technological risks have also emerged in the physical battlefield, with countries such as Turkey and Russia on the edge of developing “fully autonomous killer drones,” Feldstein said.
“If more states are convinced that autonomous drones are the key to the future of war, then they will be motivated to pour resources into developing these technologies,” Feldstein said. “And due to the open technological revolution where innovation has shifted from governments to private commercial firms, a wider group of countries can acquire advanced tools for military uses.”
“One dimension of that, I think, has been Russia seeking to co-op Ukraine’s digital infrastructure,” he said. “They targeted the TV tower because they recognize that severing the ability of Ukrainians to either consume or produce information would be key to the Russian forces being able to assert control very quickly over Ukraine.”
“It’s incumbent upon citizens, civil society, researchers, academics, and others to work closely with policymakers to inform them of risks, and to help push for action when it comes to legislation, directives, and so forth,” Feldstein added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine Harvard Ph.D. students presented their research to the public at the 10th annual Harvard Horizons symposium held Tuesday evening in Sanders Theatre.
The Harvard Horizons program, founded in 2013 by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, is offered to a handful of Ph.D. candidates each year and provides students with mentorship on effective research presentations and professional growth.
This year’s cohort includes Gbemisola O. Abiola, Floor S. Broekgaarden, Steven W. Kasparek, Ryan Keen, Lydia A. Krasilnikova, Adam J. Longenbach, Garry S. Mitchell, Jinyoung Seo, and Emilio Vavarella.
GSAS Dean Emma Dench moderated the event while Ph.D. students presented research from their respective field of study.
Seo, a Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry and Chemical Biology, presented on how a solid refrigerant can replace traditional air conditioners, which emit powerful greenhouse gases.
“Right now I think we use about 20 percent of electricity through our air conditioner, which is huge,” Seo said in an interview. “Improving, for example, efficiency by 10 percent could actually have a dramatic impact on this whole climate change challenge.”
Seo said his work aims to improve understanding of “seemingly simple concepts” and “amplify unexpected connections and opportunities” between fundamental ideas.
Psychology Ph.D. candidate Kasparek discussed how violence can shape bias and affect mental health. Kasperek said in an interview that he “always wanted to work with kids who experience adversity,” and his work has centered around this topic.
“This project that I presented at Horizons was originally looking at trying to see if there’s any kind of link between experiencing violence and being more likely to be involved in violence later in life through bias,” Kasperek said.
His research monitored children starting at the ages of five or six for a period of four years and examined correlations between participants’ abilities to form in-group favoritism and symptoms of anxiety and depression.
“Kids who experienced violence favorite their in-group less,” Kasparek said of his research findings. “That led to more symptoms of depression and anxiety — not more symptoms of aggression or externalizing problems, which is what we originally hypothesized.”
Krasilnikova, a Ph.D. candidate in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, investigated the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in preventing the spread of the virus.
“When viruses replicate inside of our bodies, they make mistakes, and we use those mistakes called mutations to retrace how the virus spread from person to person,” Krasilnikova said, explaining her work.
Using this technique, Krasilnikova traced an outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, that took place in summer 2020. She found that, though “vaccination dramatically reduces risk of death and disease severity and risk of long term effects, it does not eliminate spread.”
Her research concluded that in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19, people need to follow additional safety precautions, such as masking, even after being vaccinated.
Mitchell, a Ph.D. candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, investigated the ethics of programs intended to prepare minority students to enter elite colleges. He concluded that minority students who attend such programs carry a “meaningfully different burden” compared to the children they grew up around.
In order to achieve upward mobility, Mitchell said, they are not only held to a different standard than their white counterparts, but they often have to sacrifice their identities.
“While we might hope to be reducing inequality there might be some ways that we’re actually exacerbating it within groups,” he said.
Scholars in the Horizons program were able to interact and become familiar with each other’s research. Krasilnikova said she appreciated being able to see what other students were researching because “you never know how things are going to connect.”
Students also lauded the program for teaching the skill of communicating academic research to a wide audience.
“As a Ph.D. student, there’s a lot of bumps along the way and along the journey,” Mitchell said. “To have a moment where your work is celebrated and recognized, not only by the peers in your field, but by a much broader audience is a really exciting opportunity, and a really rare one.”

A group of Harvard undergraduates, faculty, and alumni have been quietly meeting over the past two years to examine what they see as a lack of free idea exchange at the College.
Some members of the “Intellectual Vitality Committee,” facilitated by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, have also been invited to present to influential Harvard bodies including the Faculty Council and Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body.
Committee member Shira Z. Hoffer ’25 wrote in a statement that the group welcomed those who “feel like Harvard could be doing better in striving toward veritas.”
“The purpose of the committee is to brainstorm and implement ways to increase what we are calling ‘intellectual vitality’ on campus,” Hoffer wrote. “We believe that it is not just possible but crucial to engage with dissenting viewpoints, as long as we do so respectfully, and it is a passion for this engagement which brings us together.”
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo wrote in a statement that the College is committed to creating an environment of “open dialogue, vigorous inquiry, and intellectual exploration.”
“Dean Khurana has appreciated multiple opportunities to discuss intellectual vitality with students and faculty for the past two years.” the statement reads. “We will continue to have these discussions to strengthen the College’s culture of open dialogue, respectful disagreement, freedom to express one’s views, and openness to changing one’s mind.”
“Dean Khurana strongly believes in the importance of academic freedom, which allows students and faculty to engage in inquiry without fear of censorship or reprisal,” he added.
Member Jaya J. Nayar ’24 said the group is considering a variety of initiatives, including changes to the College’s admissions essays, orientation programming, and expository writing program.
Philosophy professor Edward J. “Ned” Hall, who helped form the group, said the committee has also discussed introducing an annual “citizens’ assembly” to debate campus issues.
“There’s one that a lot of us on the faculty — and I think students too — would love to see the University administration take up, which is to just issue a very clear, forceful statement about the importance of free inquiry on a college campus,” Hall said.
Hall is also the co-president of the recently announced Council for Academic Freedom at Harvard, a separate, faculty-led group focused on supporting “free inquiry, intellectual diversity, civil discourse,” according to its website.
Some members of the Intellectual Vitality Committee earlier this month presented to the Board of Overseers, in order to share experiences related to the free idea exchange on campus and to present their vision for improvement, Nayar said.
“We are really trying to reencourage disagreement and look for healthier forms of disagreement, rather than having things that are spats on the email chains or in GroupMes that really devolve into nothing but hurt feelings and bitter sentiments,” Nayar said.
Similar topics around free speech and academic freedom have recently come to the fore at peer schools, including Stanford and Cornell.
Still, professor of Astronomy Karin I. Öberg, a member of the Intellectual Vitality Committee, said she believes Harvard’s issues and solutions are distinct.
“I do think there are sort of somewhat different flavors of this at different universities, and I think it’s important that Harvard, as Harvard, also figures out what its mission is,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston-area students and activists picketed Cambridge City Hall from Monday to Friday in protest of the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge Police Department officer, marking the latest demonstration in a monthslong campaign.
Faisal, a Bangladeshi American student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was killed by police on Jan. 4. The shooting occurred after the Cambridge Police Department responded to a 911 call reporting that a man had jumped through a window and was harming himself, according to a CPD press release. After a foot chase through Cambridgeport, Faisal allegedly moved toward police wielding a knife, and when a sponge round failed to stop him, an officer fatally shot him.
Faisal’s killing by police sparked months of protest against alleged brutality in Cambridge’s police and has renewed calls for alternative to policing, transparency, and police reform.
The weeklong picket included an iftar — a traditional meal when Muslims break their fast after sunset during Ramadan — on Monday, a mural session on Wednesday, an open mic event on Thursday, and several rallies.
Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer and MIT alumnus Husayn R. Karimi said in a Monday interview that it was important to hold an iftar because of Faisal’s family’s Muslim identity.
“Faisal’s family and many community members — many people in the Bangladeshi community — are Muslim, practice Islam, and observe Ramadan,” Karimi said. “Many of the organizers are Muslim too.”
Karimi, who emceed the Monday protest, said the decision to picket City Hall drew inspiration from historic social movements.
“Pickets have a very important legacy in the labor movement and the civil rights movement as a demonstration of being fed up,” Karimi said. “We wanted to picket to draw more attention to the issue and do it for a prolonged period of time to show our strength that we’re out here for the long haul.”
On Monday, protesters marched in an oval along the sidewalk facing City Hall, waving signs and shouting chants of “If we don’t get no justice, then they don’t get no peace!” and “Can’t stop, won’t stop! Jail those killer cops!” One demonstrator pounded on a drum to the rhythm of the chants as another played a cymbal and danced.
Protesters reiterated demands for City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 and other officials to name, fire, and prosecute the officers involved in Faisal’s killing, as well as to release the full unredacted police report. Huang has maintained that the names of the officers and the police report will be released following the completion of the Middlesex District Attorney’s investigation.
The “Justice for Faisal” movement comprises students from more than seven Boston-area universities and members of Safe Schools Somerville, the Bangladeshi Association of New England, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, in addition to other residents and activists.
At the Monday rally, Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer and MIT senior Susanna Chen criticized Huang for his handling of a recent meeting between activists and city officials.
“During the meeting, it became immediately clear that the City Manager Huang did not see us as constituents he needed to answer to,” Chen told protesters. “We didn’t anticipate the extent to which the City Manager chose to disrespect us and this movement.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Huang wrote that he does not support firing and prosecuting any officers before the conclusion of the district attorney’s investigation.
“Last month, I met with four Boston PSL organizers and 13 student organizers and had a two-hour conversation. I appreciate their passion and dedication,” Huang wrote. “We must wait for the inquest to conclude and I am committed to taking action if wrongdoing is found.”
Huang also wrote that Cambridge “is not waiting to do the work of responding to this tragedy.”
In the months following Faisal’s killing, Huang and other officials have pledged reforms, including equipping CPD officers with body cameras and increasing funding for non-police public safety alternatives. CPD has also hired the Police Executive Research Forum — a third-party police think tank — to conduct an external independent review of the department.
Some protesters have taken issue with the think tank’s review — including at Monday’s rally — citing the organization’s police-affiliated leadership.
“The president, the vice president, the treasurer, and the secretary of PERF are all cops,” PSL organizer Matthew Kennedy said Monday.
In a March press release, the city announced that the review will be conducted by both law enforcement professionals and researchers outside of policing.
Karimi called the weeklong picket “extremely energizing” and said participating was like “a release of frustration, rightful lifelong indignation.”
“It cuts through a lot of the hopelessness that in this case the city wants us to feel — that we can’t do anything,” Karimi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of more than 70 Harvard professors co-led by Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker has formed the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard — an initiative to promote ideals of free speech and inquiry.
The council was announced in a Wednesday op-ed in the Boston Globe by Harvard Medical School professor Bertha K. Madras and Pinker, known for his controversial view that educational institutions have prioritized progressive ideals over free speech.
Pinker and Madras wrote that the group “will encourage the adoption and enforcement of policies that protect academic freedom.”
“When an individual is threatened or slandered for a scholarly opinion, which can be emotionally devastating, we will lend our personal and professional support,” they wrote. “When activists are shouting into an administrator’s ear, we will speak calmly but vigorously into the other one, which will require them to take the reasoned rather than the easy way out.”
The council’s six co-presidents are former Harvard Medical School Dean and professor Jeffrey S. Flier; Philosophy professor Edward J. “Ned” Hall; Harvard Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen; former Harvard College Dean and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68; History professor Jane Kamensky; and Pinker. Flynn J. Cratty, a lecturer in History, is the council’s executive director.
The group first formally convened at a March 22 meeting, where they selected the co-presidents, according to Cratty.
The Council’s membership includes professors from across the University, including Economics and Harvard Kennedy School professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Jason Furman ’92, former University President Lawrence H. Summers, and Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw.
Three University Professors — Harvard’s highest ranking professors — are members: Summers, Eric S. Maskin ’72, and Gary King.
Its membership also includes some professors who have been involved in high-profile controversies, including Law School professors Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., who sparked outrage in 2019 after deciding to represent disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in court; J. Mark Ramseyer, who published a controversial 2021 paper arguing “comfort women” forced into sex slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II were actually contracted sex workers; and Janet E. Halley, who represents embattled professor John L. Comaroff.
In a Wednesday interview, Summers said “making sure that there are no unacceptable subjects on university campuses, and promoting viewpoint diversity is profoundly important.”
“There are very serious issues of viewpoint diversity, and unacceptable subjects for dialogue and pressures for conformity at Harvard, as there are other universities,” he added.
Despite the reputation of academic freedom as an issue mainly touted by conservatives, Lewis said that he did not consider the organization to be driven by a political agenda.
Government professor and CAFH member Ryan D. Enos concurred, saying academic freedom can be threatened “from both sides of the aisle.”
“At certain times, we might find that our own ideologies are the ones that are in the minority or the ones that are out of power and maybe under attack, and that limits our ability to do our jobs and to do the research we’re supposed to do,” Enos said.
But HLS professor Nikolas E. Bowie, who is not on the Council, viewed it with skepticism, writing in an email that the “actual threats to academic freedom” were Harvard’s resistance to students, faculty, and staff labor organizing efforts.
“I’m looking forward to seeing this council of tenured professors use their power against exploitation on campus,” Bowie wrote. “But I won’t hold my breath.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.
In an emailed statement, Cratty said critical discussion about the best ways to promote academic freedom was in the spirit of the Council’s mission.
Some faculty who are not on the Council, like Harvard Divinity School professor Janet Gyatso, agree that academic freedom is at risk.
“There is a great temptation on the part of politicians, especially ambitious ones, and businessmen, especially greedy ones, to try to control information and the production of knowledge,” Gyatso wrote in an emailed statement.
“But as scholars we need to be able to utter and analyse everything, including uncomfortable histories, in order to get at the truth,” she added.
For Lewis, the former dean of the College, academic freedom is tied intrinsically to Harvard’s mission.
“I love Harvard, I think it’s the greatest university in the world, and I want it to stay that way,” he said. “And the only way it’s gonna stay that way is if it’s a welcome place for people to voice unpopular opinions and to be oddballs in various ways and countercultural in various ways.”

When Donaldson “Don” Hill ’79 began thinking about applying to college as a senior in high school, submitting an application to Harvard was not on his radar.
“If you’re not from a culture where Harvard seems accessible and desirable, you don’t think about that,” said Hill, who grew up in Alabama and Georgia.
But then, a Harvard admissions officer gave a presentation at his high school, and he and several students decided to apply on a whim. He and one other classmate were accepted.
“They did a good job of saying not just, ‘Harvard is a great place,’ but, ‘You should think about it. You should try it. Harvard is for everyone,’” Hill said.
The presentation was part of a set of admissions practices enacted by the College in the 1970s to increase diversity on campus.
These policies represented the Harvard administration’s largest formal effort to push for an increase in racial, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity on campus, though students and activists had advocated for change for years prior.
In 1978, the Supreme Court declared that affirmative action was constitutional in the landmark case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.
In an opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. cited Harvard’s holistic admission practices — which he dubbed the “Harvard Plan” — as a model for admissions policies in higher education across the country.
But now, the College’s admissions practices are facing scrutiny in a high-profile lawsuit brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which alleges that the College discriminates against Asian American applicants by considering race. The Supreme Court heard the case in October.
A decision is expected in the coming months. Most legal scholars anticipate the Court will rule against Harvard and the constitutionality of affirmative action.
With affirmative action and the Harvard Plan in jeopardy, alumni, legal scholars, and administrators reflected on the push for campus diversity and how it changed the College’s student body.
The College accepted its first Black student — Beverly Garnett Williams — in 1847, but he died before matriculation. It wasn’t until 1870 that Harvard saw its first Black graduate: Richard T. Greener.
When James W. Wiley III ’65 first arrived on campus nearly a century later, he was one of roughly a dozen Black students in his class, he said.
While Wiley did not recall experiencing overt racism from others students — like “a riot or a street confrontation” — subtle reminders of the College’s exclusivity were far-reaching.
“As I walked down the street to my residence at Dunster House, I would pass by the private clubs along the street,” Wiley said. “I knew what they were, and I knew I couldn’t get in them — wouldn’t even try.”
In 1962, Wiley helped found the Association of African and Afro-American Students, a group that would later staunchly advocate for increased racial diversity at Harvard.
During his time at Harvard, Wiley said he noticed an increasing number of Black students on campus, adding that “student life was definitely changing.”
“I don’t know if that was conscious affirmative action policy, or whether it was what Harvard claimed it was, which was trying to get the best and the brightest to diversify its classes and give them strength,” he said.
When Leslie F. “Skip” Griffin Jr. ’70 arrived at the College in 1966, he was no stranger to civil rights organizing.
As a child, Griffin was the plaintiff in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County — one of the school desegregation cases consolidated into the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.
Griffin became president of AAAAS in 1968 and maintained the position until he graduated from the College.
Six days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, AAAAS published a set of four demands for the College’s administration in The Crimson. The demands included the establishment of “an endowed chair for a Black professor” and “admitting a number of Black students proportionate to our percentage of the population as a whole.”
“Fact of the matter is, I think we had an awareness that if we could shift things at Harvard and if Harvard would have a significant response, that it would have an impact nationally,” Griffin said.
Jennifer D. Carey ’78 — who also worked as a senior admissions officer at the College — said she believes after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Harvard realized the nation was “in crisis.”
“In order to have a long-term impact as a leading institution, they needed to do more in terms of the recruitment of Black students,” she said.
A year later, Walter J. Leonard, the assistant dean and assistant director of admissions of Harvard Law School in 1969, and Derek C. Bok, the dean of HLS and later University president, began working together to push for affirmative action policies.
Together, they enacted race-conscious, holistic admissions first at the Law School and later at the College.
Leonard was crucial to helping Black students “understand that we not only very much wanted to have them, but that there was enough financial aid so that they would not find it too expensive to enroll,” Bok said in an interview with The Crimson last October.
When Bok became University president in 1971, he appointed Leonard as his special assistant.
Bok said there were “a lot of problems” in implementing affirmative action policies at the College compared to the Law School, where he and Leonard were “a little bit more successful” in creating holistic admissions practices.
“So fortunately, Walter came with me and we started all over again to try to understand those problems better and see what we could do to do something about them,” Bok said.
Leonard’s University-wide affirmative action policy allowed race to be considered as one factor in the admissions process, along with factors like geographic diversity and gender.
The initiative also included the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, in which the admissions office hired student recruiters and send them to high schools across the country to make the pitch for Harvard.
John A. “Tony” Butler ’80 recalled a visit from a Harvard student through the program during his senior year at Brooklyn Technical High School, which inspired him to become a recruiter himself as a sophomore at the College.
Butler described recruiting diverse students as “a collaborative effort” between the students and the admissions office.
“The admissions office provided office space and support and resources for us to decide ‘Okay, well, what cities do we want to visit?’” Butler said. “But as Harvard students we self-organized to do the outreach that we wanted to do.”
Still, in the early years of Leonard’s plan, the College struggled to increase the number of minority students. While roughly 100 Black students were admitted to the College each year between 1969 and 1971, these figures began to drop in 1972 and 1973, according to a 1974 Crimson article.
Carey, who worked in the admissions and financial aid office from 1982 to 1992, said she saw the eventual effects of Harvard’s push for diversity during her decade in the office.
“We saw the numbers of kids apply and go up dramatically during that time. And the range of schools that we were seeing candidates from increased dramatically,” she said.
Bok said he did not recall much backlash on campus to the College’s race-conscious admissions policies during his presidency.
“I didn’t detect any internal opposition, either from Blacks or certainly from within the faculty,” he said. “In my experience, we had to battle the outside world, namely the Supreme Court.”
After applying twice to the University of California, Davis Medical School and facing rejection both times, Allan P. Bakke, a 35-year-old white applicant, alleged that he was being discriminated against on the basis of race.
At the time of the suit, UC Davis had a racial quota system in place that reserved 16 out of 100 spots in its incoming class for “qualified” minorities.
Prior to instituting the quota system, the medical students of UC Davis were “almost entirely white and wealthy,” said Jonathan Feingold, an associate professor of law at Boston University.
The Harvard administration carefully followed the Bakke case because it put the College’s diverse recruitment efforts at risk. Ahead of the decision, Harvard filed an amicus brief in support of UC Davis.
Bok said he saw the legal fight to preserve affirmative action as a “do or die struggle.”
Butler drove up to Washington with a classmate to participate in a demonstration outside the Supreme Court during the hearing.
“We wanted to support the continuation of affirmative action. So there was concern and activism, encouraging students to pay attention and to try to be engaged in the matter,” Butler said.
The Supreme Court ruled for Bakke in 1978. While some of the Court’s liberal justices supported affirmative action as a way to remedy past racial injustices, conservative justices argued the constitution should be race-blind.
In crafting the judgment of the Court, Powell struck a compromise between the two sides — arguing that diversity of the student body was a “compelling interest.”
The Court cited Harvard’s admissions program as an “illuminating example” because it used race as one of several factors in the admissions process instead of setting quotas for minority students.
“A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer,” Powell wrote in the Court’s opinion.
Noah R. Feldman ’92, a professor at the Law School and a scholar of constitutional law, compared Harvard’s holistic admissions to “the Hogwarts sorting hat.”
“It’s supposed to be some idea that magically the admissions officers know exactly who you are,” Feldman said. “Each applicant is a special snowflake, is uniquely evaluated, and then somehow magically evaluated in contrast and comparison to the other applicants, but without any objectively quantifiable measure.”
Carey pushed back on the viewpoint that admissions officers ever consider applicants solely on the basis of race.
“What is actually being considered is a student’s background, student’s life experience, and what they will be able to contribute to the richness of experience at Harvard,” Carey said.
Harvard’s recruiting efforts go beyond racial diversity, extending to other groups including low-income and first-generation students, Carey added.
“Harvard’s recruitment program did not just and does not just focus on kids of color. It focuses on low-income white students, blue-collar, non-college white students, every measure of diversity that you can think about,” Carey said.
While Leonard created Harvard’s blueprint for affirmative action, Carey said minority recruitment is “not a one and done.”
“It’s something that you have to do each year as you recruit each class,” Carey said.
In the decades after Bakke, the Supreme Court has returned to the question of race-conscious admissions again and again: Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, Fisher v. University of Texas in 2013, and Fisher again in 2016.
“In practice, very little changed,” Feldman said of each challenge to affirmative action.
Now, the Supreme Court appears poised to strike down race-conscious policies in admissions. Questions remain as to how the end of affirmative action could impact the admissions processes and class composition.
“People tend to use affirmative action as people who aren’t qualified getting in. And that’s not what it was at all,” said Deborah D. Desir ’76, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine. “It was people who were barred from getting in being allowed to come in.”
When asked about the ongoing Supreme Court case against Harvard, Butler expanded on a quote by Martin Luther King Jr.
“The arc of history is long but bends toward justice,” Butler said. “But it doesn’t bend by itself.”
Other College alumni remain optimistic for the future, regardless of the Court’s decision.
“I think that whatever the Court does, there is a kinship that has started to develop among African and Afro-American students that has changed the language by which we refer to each other and by which we talk about ourselves,” Wiley said.
Myles V. Lynk III ’70 said when he returned for his 50th alumni reunion, he still felt “a little like an outsider,” though he “enjoyed being back.”
“I’m glad to the extent that there’s a greater critical mass of students of all races and cultures that are here today who can feel comfortable, both within the greater mosaic of the campus, but also within their group on the campus,” Lynk added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Raucous cheers erupted from the 2,455 spectators around Jordan Field Saturday afternoon as the Harvard men’s lacrosse team defended its home turf against No. 4 Cornell in a huge 10-8 upset. The underdog team played lockdown defense and the stellar performance was not lost on viewers as the win resulted in a sweep of the weekly Ivy League honors. Leader and junior goalie Christian Barnard was named the Ivy League Player of the Week for his standout performance in cage with a 66% save rate, while first-year attackman Teddy Malone was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week for his performances against both Dartmouth and Cornell.
Cornell came out hot, taking a three-goal lead within the first few minutes of play in the first quarter. A wise timeout by head coach Gerry Byrne helped to reset the team and allowed it to regroup and claw back two goals to narrow the gap to one at the end of the first. The timeout was critical in getting the squad back in the game as Cornell came out fast, pushing Harvard to play with more speed and intensity than it has had all season. The Big Red was able to go up initially because its faceoff unit capitalized on the Crimson’s weakness at the faceoff, winning possession on the first three faceoffs. Cornell was able to strike on the faceoff throughout the game, winning sixteen of the 22 takes, which gave it more possession time on the offensive end and put more pressure on Barnard and the defense to come up with big stops.
“They are a high-energy, high-skill team, and you can’t meet it, you have to exceed it. So, I challenged our guys in the locker room before to be great,” Byrne said. “You know that you’re going to be imperfect, so you’ve got to move through mistakes, which is a good life lesson, and we just needed to compete with them.”
“They are one of the most competitive teams, high-energy, ferocious, physical teams, and we had to meet it and exceed it,” continued Byrne. “I think that when we were playing well – which was a lot of that game – we did that.”
Despite Cornell’s attacking phenom junior C.J. Kirst scoring the first goal for the Big Red, sophomore defender Collin Bergstrom was able to mitigate that threat on the defensive end and keep him relatively quiet throughout the game. This was not an easy feat, as Kirst is currently ranked as the highest-scoring attackman in the country with 43 goals on the season. He is also the seventh-highest point-scorer, with an additional nine points coming from assists.
“C.J. Kirst is one of the best players in the country, and Collin Bergstrom guarded him,” Byrne said. “Even though he was 4-1 and scored a couple [of] unsettled goals, he did a tremendous job guarding him. When we needed to support him with help, our guys did a great job doing that – and Barnard made the saves that we know he can make”
Sophomore defender Tommy Martinson and first-year defender Charlie Muller were part of the defensive unit that held the 28th most efficient offense in the nation — averaging 14.56 goals per game — to only 8 goals. This success stemmed from lock-down one-on-one defense as well as quick slides, and even quicker recovery slides, that slowed down Cornell’s ball movement and kept its offense from being able to find open attackers on the backside. The team held Cornell to a 16.3% efficiency rate, allowing for just 8 goals on 49 possessions. The team’s success sliding was also apparent in shutting down the Big Red’s man-up play, not allowing the team to score on its sole opportunity.
“I think we put it all together today. The offense was scoring goals, and the defense was playing very well,” Barnard stated. “They have one of the best players in the country in C.J. Kirst and I think that we did a really good job trying to minimize him. You can’t contain him completely, but you [have to] minimize his plays — I think our defense did an extraordinary job of that.”
Success on the defensive end translated to success on both sides of the field. Cornell was able to clear on all of its attempts, but the ferocious Crimson ride held Cornell to the end of its allotted twenty seconds in clearing over the fifty, which caused many of Cornell’s offensive possessions to wind down to under ten seconds. Because they took longer in clearing, Cornell’s substitution game was not as efficient and Harvard had an easier time locking down and stopping the fast break, which allowed the defensive to set up and make Cornell force shots with just a few seconds left on the clock. Harvard took advantage of these caused turnovers, and two defensive middies, sophomore Ray Dearth and senior Chase Yager found success in stripping their players, securing the ground ball, and going coast-to-coast for fast-break goals.
Offensive decision-making will be something the Crimson squad will look to improve on going into its next contest against UPenn. The team had trouble setting down for the first few minutes of play which caused lapses in judgment in shot selection. Of the team’s 47 shots, only 24 were on goal. This was due to the offense looking to play a much faster-style game to find gaps in the Cornell defense, but the result was that the attackers and middies were stuffed either by senior Cornell goalie Chayse Ierlan or by defenders who ate shots as they stepped out to act as the slide or second slide. Despite this miscommunication, the offense appeared much stronger in playing a fast yet deliberate style of sets. Sophomore Andrew Perry was a standout on that end of the field, notching three goals and an assist. The depth of the Crimson attack was revealed as something to laud against Cornell, with eight different Harvard players tallying goals.
“Our offense moved the ball a lot quicker, we were in better spots, and we saw a lot of ways to improve down there. It wasn’t our best, but we’ll take it,” Perry commented. “Our defense played extremely well and kept getting us the ball which allowed us to capitalize. Great team win, and one to build on going into Penn next weekend.”
The Ivy League is extremely competitive and the squad’s next matchup against UPenn won’t be any easier than the game against Cornell. UPenn is currently ranked No. 18 in the nation, dropping four spots this week due to a 12-11 loss to Brown, a team that Harvard beat at the beginning of the season in an impressive overtime battle. Penn will be a different beast for the Crimson to tackle as the Quakers are notorious for recruiting players based on size and athleticism, which is different from Cornell which was a slippery and crafty offense.
“We have Penn next, and we are hoping for another great crowd. They are a different team — Penn’s midfielders are gigantic, so it’s going to be a physical battle at the midfield,” Byrne noted. “Guarding number 27 and number 2 today will give us some knowledge and insight into how to do that”
Harvard takes on UPenn Saturday at 12:00 p.m. on Jordan Field. The game will also be streamed live on ESPN+. Following the men’s game, the women’s lacrosse team will battle against No. 16 Yale at 3:30 p.m. in a game that not only honors the most historic rivalry in the Ancient Eight but will honor sophomore defender Grace Taylor’s fight against cancer. The team looks to highlight the efforts of the Mass General Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Program, a program that seeks to empower young adults suffering from cancer through community building and social opportunities.
Harvard women’s lacrosse’s honoring of Taylor’s cancer battle emphasizes its tight-knit and supportive community. While the games are competitive and each team looks to battle for the NCAA Championship trophy at the end of the season, the relationships created and the respect players have for their peers make the community special.
Going into this weekend, the focus for both teams will be to upset their opponents as they gear up for a stretch of competitive Ivy League games. The Crimson squads will look to string together four solid quarters of play on both ends of the field to come out victorious.
“It’s always tough in our league, we have the best teams in the country so we need to be ready to prepare and battle every single game,” Perry said. “Anybody can win on any day, so as long as we are prepared and doing what we need to do I think we have a good shot”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the annual Beanpot Tournament final, the Harvard men’s baseball team faced No. 11 Boston College in a winner-take-all matchup, falling to the Eagles 5-4 despite a hard-fought effort.
After defeating Northeastern on April 4 in their first-round game, the Crimson’s matchup with the Eagles marked the 32nd anniversary of adding baseball to the historic Beanpot Tournament. Famed for its historic hockey rivalries, the Beanpot Tournament is an annual tournament where Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern compete for an in-season, Boston bragging rights championship with nothing but history on the line for hockey, basketball, and baseball teams alike. In early February, then-No. 9 Harvard men’s hockey lost in a 3-2 shootout thriller to then-No. 16 Northeastern, giving the Huskies the historic Boston trophy.
Making a four-mile trek to the Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at the Harrington Athletics Village of the Eagles in Brighton, Mass, the Crimson hoped to build on its six-game winning streak and three consecutive Ivy League series victories.
After having their worst start in a season since 2013 at 2-14, Harvard has completely flipped the switch entering Ivy League play. Defeating Penn, Dartmouth, and Princeton in consecutive weeks, along with additional victories against Northeastern and Holy Cross, the Crimson has taken control of its season just when things seemed unsalvageable. Going 9-3 in that span, Harvard entered its matchup against their highest-ranked opponent of the year at no better time.
“For us to be 7-2 [conference record] going into the weekend in league competition is a short-term testament to our club,” head coach Bill Decker said. “We [have to] keep on moving, weekend by weekend.”
Having defeated five AP Top 25 ranked teams this season, Boston College easily shaped up to be the Crimson’s toughest game of the year. Falling behind 3-0 in the first four innings, the Crimson erupted for four runs in the top of the fifth. The Eagles equalized Harvard with a run in the bottom of the sixth, and after a two-and-a-half inning scoring drought on both sides, Boston College ended things on a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth.
Playing at BC’s home stadium, the Crimson walked to the plate in the top of the first to kick things off. Unfortunately, Harvard neither kicked nor hit anything, going three up, three down to begin.
Handing the ball to senior Will Jacobsen, the Crimson took the field in the bottom of the inning. Jacobsen’s day at the mound began with some turbulence, hitting two of his first four batters and walking another. With the bases loaded, the Eagles scored the first run of the game on a wild pitch to put Boston College up 1-0 with runners on second and third. Jacobsen then walked another runner, loading the bases again before a fly-out by BC ended an eventful inning.
After the inning ended, Decker commented that the team “just tried to minimize damage.”
A quiet second inning on both sides briefly stalled Boston College from widening the score gap, but a pair of home runs in the bottom of the third inning by the Eagles pushed the Crimson into a 3-0 deficit. Jacobsen ended his day at the end of the third, finishing with 3 ER in three innings pitched.
At the opposite side of the diamond, the Harvard bats stayed rather quiet through the fourth inning, except for a second-inning single by senior Zach Brown and a fourth-inning double by first-year Gio Colasante.
The scoreboard remained blank for the Crimson until a fifth-inning explosion pushed Harvard back into contention. Back-to-back singles by sophomore Matt Gilberti and senior Hunter Baldwin gave the Crimson runners first and second bases to open the inning. Harvard proceeded to load the bases in the next at-bat when junior Peter Messervy was hit by a pitch.
The Crimson capitalized on the moment when junior Ben Rounds roped a double to left, driving in Gilberti and Baldwin while advancing Messervy to third. With it cut to one at 3-2 and runners on second and third, senior Logan Bravo saw four straight balls and walked to third, reloading the bases for the second time in the inning. On the next at-bat, junior Jake Berger was hit by a pitch, resulting in another run for the Crimson and loading the bases for a third time. In similar fashion, freshman Jordan Kang’s walk in the following at-bat drove in an additional run and kept the bases filled up, putting Harvard in the lead for the first time in the game at 4-3 before the end of the top of the fifth.
Silent plate appearances by the Eagles and the Crimson kept the score constant entering into the bottom of the sixth, where an RBI groundout by Eagles’ third baseman Pat Roche equalized the score at 4-4.
Harvard fired blanks for the next two innings, unable to reach base in both the seventh and eighth innings. Stirring up some noise with two outs in the ninth inning, Harvard loaded the bases off of walks from Ben Rounds and Jake Berger sandwiching a Logan Bravo single. Unfortunately, Harvard struck out to end the inning, leaving the three runners stranded.
On the first at-bat of the ninth, Eagles third baseman Nick Wang homered to left center, walking off the Crimson in crushing fashion.
This weekend, the Crimson will return to home base for another conference series against Cornell. Tied with Columbia at the top of the Ivy League standings, how Harvard fares in Ivy League play will determine if the Crimson can pull off an NCAA postseason berth that would have seemed improbable three weeks ago.
But for the time being, Harvard plans to take things one game at a time.
“The only thing that matters right now is what’s gonna happen tomorrow,” Decker said.

Tired of your typical Starbucks caramel macchiato in the morning? Searching for a new Starbucks order especially with reading week around the corner? You’re in the right place. As a Starbucks enthusiast, I am constantly looking for recipes to spice up my daily Starbies. Luckily, the TikTok algorithm graced my FYP with the Secret Starbucks menu... I tried these trendy Starbucks drinks so you don’t have to. You’re welcome :)

This secret menu item is rumored to taste like a chocolate-covered strawberry — shocking, right? The drink order is actually super simple which is great for someone (myself) who gets anxious ordering a drink with many alterations. My only grievance was paying an extra $1.25 for the chocolate cream cold foam on top. The presentation was… questionable, but it did taste like a chocolate-covered strawberry. Would I get it again? Probably not, but if you are a chocolate and/or strawberry lover, this is the drink for you!

When I stumbled onto this drink on TikTok, I was initially drawn to it because of its vibrant color. This drink is perfect for the upcoming warmer weather: It’s aesthetically pleasing, refreshing, and has the perfect amount of sweetness. It literally tastes like melted strawberry ice cream. I didn’t even care that I had to pay extra for the strawberry puree and cold foam. 10/10 recommendation.
Iced Chai Tea Latte with Blonde Espresso Roast, Oat Milk, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam, and Cinnamon Powder
If you’re looking for a Starbies drink with more caffeine, I totally recommend this drink, especially if you’re a chai tea latte lover. This drink has the perfect variety of flavors with every sip. The combination of the vanilla sweet cream cold foam with blonde espresso roast is truly superior. The addition of cinnamon powder adds a little kick to your first sip. This drink tends to be on the sweeter side, so if you want to satisfy your sweet tooth, order this drink!
After reviewing these Starbies drinks I will definitely be trying every drink on my TikTok FYP from now on. These drinks have spiced up my regular Starbuck orders and if you’re willing to venture beyond your normal iced latte, this is the place to start.
