After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone’s favorite nightmarish but dreamy stalker, Joe Goldberg, is back as the smash hit “You” returns for a second season, this time in a nauseatingly woke part of LA featuring a new girl for Joe to obsess over. On the run from Candace, his ex-girlfriend whose cliffhanger appearance ended season one, Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) adopts the new identity of Will Bettelheim and tries to rebuild his life in the last place on earth he would normally want to live. Upon arrival, Joe finds a new love interest, a chef named Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) who comes from a rich, dysfunctional family and quickly manipulates his way into her life. Thus begins 10 episodes of perverse, entertaining, and slightly trashy drama that remains as fresh as ever. It retains the humanizing voiceover narration and interesting exploration of abuse and power that give “You” its unique flavor without feeling remotely stale.
While throwing Joe into a completely new setting with a totally different cast of characters was risky, this sharp transition works miraculously well. Yes, Joe’s smart-ass teenage neighbor, Ellie (Jenna Ortega), might make viewers grit their teeth, and Love’s obnoxiously hipster friends lack substance. But the central characters, including Love, her twin brother Forty (James Scully), and Ellie’s sister Delilah (Carmela Zumbado), are engaging enough to make up the difference. Victoria Pedretti, in particular, shines as the compassionate Love Quinn (who also happens to have some nasty skeletons in her closet). While, initially, Love’s relationship with Joe seems almost too perfect — especially considering Beck’s infidelity and self-centeredness — it’s hard to deny the romance of their best moments. Episode five, when they say those three magic words, is particularly endearing.
Countless summaries of “You” will haphazardly characterize Joe as a psychopath, citing the fact that he’s an unwaveringly charming guy who just happens to murder nine people. This season shows why that overused label simply does not apply. Not only does Joe experience his emotions very intensely, it turns out he also lacks the narcissism typically associated with antisocial personality disorders. When Love’s friend, Gabe, performs acupuncture on Joe in episode seven, Joe admits that his self hatred over his previous actions makes him feel “unworthy of love.” Excessively codependent and obsessive, Joe seeks “love” as a way to compensate for his lack of self-worth. Reduced to intense sobs, Joe ends his session with Gabe by chanting, “I am all I need.” This moment of intense vulnerability combined with this season’s flashbacks of his abusive childhood answer the “how” and the “why” for Joe’s deep-seated issues. An already well-developed, compelling character gets all the more rich.
The entertainment value of the series also remains at an all-time high thanks to the show’s nonstop action and eagerness to throw new things into the pot. The last three installments, in particular, are thrilling, and viewers won’t be able to click “next episode” fast enough. Joe is constantly faced with another hurdle — regardless of whether it’s a dead body to dispose of or an acid trip, there is never a dull moment.
The twists and breakneck pacing aren’t the only reasons that “You” has managed to stick out amongst the sensory overload that is Netflix’s home page. Perhaps what really gives “You” its competitive edge is its self-aware investigation into the “Ted Bundy Effect.” Sure, America’s infamous, male serial killers are deplorable, but much of the general public remains enthralled, especially if the criminal is attractive and charismatic. Demonstrated by the hordes of women confessing their unhealthy crushes on Joe over Twitter, Goldberg’s confessional voiceover complemented by his raspy voice and good looks are all too misleading.
In a recent interview with Stephen Colbert, Penn Badgley asserted, “It says something about how much we’re willing to be patient and forgive someone who inhabits a body that looks something like mine, the color of my skin, my gender, these sorts of things, these sorts of privileges. And how much less willing to forgive people who don’t fit those boxes.”
Season One of “You” dared us to fall under Joe’s spell as he pushed “all’s fair in love and war” to the limit. Yet, what made the shocking finale so ingenious was how the extremity of Joe’s crimes snapped the audience out of their daze. Instead of crafting some redemption arc for their lovable anti-hero, the writers chose to show viewers his ultimate capacity for evil, making it a lot harder to root for a dangerous killer.
Season Two’s unexpected finale twist of the unstable and murderous Love deserves praise for keeping the show exhilarating. However, the critique of society’s fascination with the attractive, white serial killer is altogether absent. Joe ends the season trapped in a relationship with a woman he’s now repulsed by, coming across more like a victim than a villain. Unlike in Season One’s finale, there’s no reminder that Joe is ultimately undeserving of the admiration that he’s gained, and while the new storyline did much to reveal his vulnerable side and show his terrible childhood, he should still not earn forgiveness.
Much to fans’ relief, “You” is almost definitely going to return for a third season. While it seems that Joe will be stuck in LA with pregnant Love, the mysterious neighbor that Joe begins to fall for in the season’s final seconds plus his future child should both add interesting elements and keep the show full of unexpected surprises.

Selena Gomez’s first album since 2015, “Rare,” is like a graph with an asymptote: It comes her closest to being vocally and lyrically genuine, but never quite gets there. It dangles authenticity without completely being authentic. While the lyrics do sometimes reveal Gomez’s state of mind, they leave the listener wanting more.
Let’s just say that in the five years since Selena Gomez last released an album, she’s been through a lot, and leave it at that. It’s easy to get sidetracked about why or how she faded into the background of the music scene due to lupus, her mental health, and the on-again, off-again tumult that was her relationship with Justin Bieber. And yet, while Gomez addresses them on the album, she makes it clear that her struggles are not what she’s choosing to focus on; rather, it’s how she deals with adversity and moves forward that interests her.
To start with the good: Gomez skillfully plays up the breathy quality of her voice, one that she didn’t really begin to discover until she went solo in 2013. It’s audible on the opening track of the album, which shares the same name, and especially on “Lose You to Love Me,” the first single teased before the album’s release. The latter is arguably the best song on the album: Full of pathos, it conveys both lyrical and vocal strength. The same vocal style also appears on “Ring,” but is sporadic enough that it’s easy to get lost among the thumping beats of the rest of the album.
Gomez’s failsafe, autotune, has been present in her music since “Falling Down” appeared in the late 2000s. While that single was a bop for her audience at the time, this failsafe has now become a crutch. While she might not have the range of Adele’s voice, Gomez does have talent: It’s just a question of harnessing her specific gift. Ditching autotune in favor of slower, breathier melodies would serve her well in the future, though “Rare” is a good step in the right direction.
But even beyond the liberal use of autotune, the bigger shame is Gomez’s lyrics. Her verses are often short — they usually start off with at least six lines, but are truncated to two or three after she clears the first chorus. It’s unfortunate, because when she does dedicate enough time to them, they evoke the pathos, foibles, and strengths that she’s encountered since the last time she released an album. “Dance Again,” for example, is filled with cliche lyrics like “I kickstart the rhythm / All the trauma's in remission” that make little sense. At a time when there’s more room than ever for artists to try something different, even the tempo on most of the tracks is similar to her 2010s pop hits.
The lyrics are either too simple or too truncated. The repetitive “mm-mm” on “Look At Her Now” not only acts as a filler, but isn’t the most appealing to the ear, as it slows down the song and makes the lines sound like talk-singing. “People You Know” luckily has complete words, but the word “people” occurs so many times that it begins to lose its meaning.
On the other hand, on “Vulnerable,” Gomez sounds like Ariana Grande, a comparison which is both apt and problematic. It’s on this track that Gomez exhibits a similar amount of vocal control, and similar range — yet the very act of comparison means that Gomez doesn’t have her own unique sound. When any one of Grande’s songs comes on the radio, it’s very clear who it is, whereas it takes a few moments to recognize Gomez.
All this is to say that “Rare” is a decent offering with a few memorable tracks which don’t quite make up for the rest of the album’s generic feel. It’s a shame, because Gomez has some important things to say. It’s certainly her best and most heartfelt album, and yet the lyrics, as they stand, fail to convey an emotional complexity that is implied at best.

There is no precedent for what Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, of British royal family fame, have done, and yet they still did it. Earlier this month the couple announced their decision to step away from their duties as senior royal family members, in addition to becoming financially independent and splitting their time between both sides of the pond. The family, the press, and the masses are still roiling.
Other royals have left the family before, in one way or another: Princess Diana did, when she divorced Prince Charles, as did Edward VIII, who abdicated the throne to marry Wallis Simpson. In both these cases, the issue centered around a marriage, either its inception or its fragmentation, but Meghan and Harry’s choice to stick around part time, while clearly desiring financial emancipation, seems to be rooted in more deeply-felt quarrels with the media and the monarchy itself than do the past royal family exoduses.
For one, there’s the incessant tabloid coverage that criticizes Meghan where it once praised Kate for similar behavior. Then there’s the incessantly critical coverage of Meghan’s family and background, which, given the no-holds-barred approach the British press took when covering her every move, contained such racist implications that Harry himself was moved to comment on it. It’s an understatement to say that the media has not been kind in its coverage of Meghan, an indignity — at best — that came to affect both husband and wife.
Then there are the family relationships, about which we can only begin to speculate. Who knows what the internal tensions were, how much sniping went on, the extent of familial and staff gossip? In any case, Meghan and Harry have reached a breaking point that, after extensive dithering and speculation online, seems to be supported by the Queen herself. Though what else can she really say? To display any anger over their decision to dissociate would be far out of line with years of emotional restraint that characterizes the monarchy.
This institution is outdated and bound by social mores that are self-imposed among the landed gentry and their peers, one that doubtless was rankled by Meghan and Harry’s decision to name their son Archie (which is not short for Archibald as many might have hoped), or Meghan’s introduction into upper-class British society. A former actress, once-divorced, and mixed-race — it’s no understatement that this echelon of Britain finds all these things uncomfortable at best.
Regarding living among the royal family and taking on the corresponding duties, Meghan herself said that “‘It’s not enough to just survive something, right?’” The word “surviving” is telling: That’s probably what she’s been trying to do since her wedding in 2018. Coupled with Harry’s own words in a 2017 interview about feeling confined in his role, the real question is: Can we really blame them for wanting out? Yes, there are financial perks and a near-endless supply of trinkets and baubles to sweeten the pot, but it could not have been pleasant living in a stifling world that requires toeing the party line while also smiling silently in its name. The situation appears to have become untenable.
Perhaps we should just leave them be. Meghan and Harry no longer want to be part of a song and dance that profits off their faces, ones that hide both the pain of remembering what the paparazzi did in the wake of Princess Diana’s death and the frustrating tolerance of vitriol lobbed at Meghan herself. They will likely never experience financial instability, but again — we’re talking about a highly stratified world so far removed from the experiences of the rest of us that the very question of whether the monarchy should be this rich is an entirely different discussion better left for another day.
This may be the first crack in the veneer overlaying the monarchy — one arguably long overdue.

“American Dirt” is an absolute triumph of fiction: Its beautiful prose and broad narrative landscape are by turns thrilling and devastating, to say nothing of its treatment of the difficult content of Mexican migration and drug cartels. The story is gripping and action-packed — but what makes it so moving is its richly real characters and beautifully rendered emotions. Best selling author Jeanine Cummins nails it with this third novel: Her villains have a penchant for poetry and her heroes have moments of selfishness and immorality. Though the sparse but harsh criticisms call out her lack of authority to portray the experiences of Mexican migrants accurately, this story still occupies an important place within current political discourse. As a work of fiction, it is utterly enthralling.
As first chapters go, “American Dirt” holds nothing back. Within the first few pages, a whole family is massacred by a rising local drug cartel, Los Jardineros, in the incongruously beautiful tourist-trap city of Acapulco, Mexico. Only two survive: mother Lydia Quixano Perez and her eight-year-old son Luca, saved by the timely call of nature. The story follows their journey across more than 1,000 miles of violence and fear towards “el norte” — the United States — a ‘promised land’ only in the sense that it is out of reach from the powerful, grasping fingers of the drug cartels. The mother-son duo endure miles of walking and the dangers of illegal travel on “La Bestia,” a freight train controlled by cartels. Their journey is under constant threat of violence, the unrelenting psychological degradation of paranoia, and endless siege from paralyzing grief. But against this desolate landscape, compassion and hope shine all the more brightly. “American Dirt” spans the spectrum of human capacity for emotion: The bleakest horrors of human evil on display alongside the warmest of human kindness and love, pushing the bounds of human capabilities in both directions.
The novel’s jumbled chronology, composed of flashbacks, tangents, and multiple perspectives, shows Cummins’ care in deciding which character would deliver which narrative arcs and when to reveal certain plot points to generate the most emotional impact. The omniscient narrator discloses short vignettes of people Lydia and Luca brush paths with along the way, tangents that become some of the most emotionally compelling parts of the story. These small acts of kindness from strangers often make the difference between life or death for our protagonists, like one mother who allows the migrants to hide in their shed from authorities who would send them back to Acapulco, erasing everything they’ve done to get this far. Though only a minor part of the narrative, these unsung angels add tremendous poignance to the novel.
Cummins’ characters are raw and unfiltered, shown with all their uncertainties and missteps alongside strength and intelligence. They are unflinchingly human, individuals with hopes and dreams who contradict our too-easy habit of making stories on the news nameless and faceless, easily dissolving into a flash of pity before we go on with our days.
Her writing is nothing short of beautiful, with Luca’s perspective engineering some of the most wonderful paintings of pain and grief. His emotions often become tangible: “The cloudburst of anguish he’s been struggling against does not come," Cummnis writes. "It remains there, pent up like a held breath, hovering just on the periphery of his mind. He has the sense that, were he to turn his head, were he to poke at the globular nightmare ever so gently with his finger, it would unleash a torrent so colossal he would be swept away forever. Luca takes care to hold himself quite still.” The childlike way of visualizing pain is both heart-wrenching and utterly believable in its simple innocence.
Previews for this book have touted it as a “‘Grapes of Wrath’ for our times,” and certainly, the novel has historical significance as an account of the current migrant crisis. Among the overwhelming deluge of positive recommendations, however, a few critics point to Cummins’ arrogance in telling this story despite being a “nonmigrant and non-Mexican.” No matter how she attempts to acknowledge her inadequacy due to her privileged position, this status makes her inherently unfit to credibly do it justice. It’s true: she often seems to be clutching for that intangible thing called authenticity, an authenticity that she can’t claim. Myriam Gurba, writing in Tropics of Meta, points to the way she sprinkles Spanish words throughout the story, “yielding the same effect as store-bought taco seasoning.”
Should she have been the one to tell this story? Should she be able to claim the mantle of “genius” when there are multitudes of Mexican, Chicanx, and Latinx writers out there who have the true credibility to write these stories?
And yet her book, while imperfect by virtue of her incomplete perspective, is still a step forward in the discourse about migration. In fact, her position of privilege might even do some good. Cummins writes for an audience like her — “estadounidenses,” people from the United States — presumably white or distant from the realities of her characters’ lives. This perspective opens a door to help the reader understand as they relate to the sheltered, naive Lydia. Audiences may have thought as she does, “with the sort of detached fascination of the comfortable elite how dire the conditions of their migrants’ lives must be wherever they come from, that this is the better option.” The way Lydia reacts to situations walks readers through revelations of the horrors of migrant life. The tale may have been whitewashed and made “palatable to taste buds estadounidenses,” but these changes in themselves have some value, as it may change the way those privileged enough to have little personal connection with the migrant crisis might understand news and policy about the Mexican border.
And so, then, the responsibility turns to the shoulders of the readers. All we can do is remember that Cummins is not able to give a primary or even secondary account of the story she pens, and to wish that advance praise didn’t laud her and this book for its supposed accuracy and possible political ramifications. It will be important to take into account the political and racial discourse surrounding the novel as one reads and reflects on it — so take this work of fiction with a grain of salt, if you will, and then go find works from actual Latinx, Chicanx, or Mexican writers to hear their truth.
I tore through “American Dirt” in one day, staying up till late at night to finish it. The story’s chronology is ingeniously woven, and Cummins clearly revels in the power of the written word. I cried, long and often, I smiled, my heart was warmed — and I learned. This book is captivating and emotional, intense and full of action, and though we might wish that Cummins be rather less righteous in her knowledge, this is a story well, well worth a read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Someday, our kids will grow up better than we did. They will have an entire room dedicated to playtime with gentle foam tiles to romp around and different toys for every day of the week. They will sleep in the finest cribs, crafted from rich oak or deep mahogany, under a ceiling as high as the sky where chandeliers glitter like the stars. They will fall asleep not to the sound of gunshots or muted arguments but to the sweet sound of silence.
Someday, our kids will eat better than we did. They will have traveled around the world using only their tongues, sampling the best delicacies each nation has to offer. They will come back from soccer practice or violin lessons to a hot meal waiting for them at the dinner table. They will never know what a hungry stomach feels like, a stomach so empty that its grumbling protests disrupt a classroom or make them redden with shame.
Someday, our kids will learn better than we did. They will roam the hallways of our nation’s best private schools and discover opportunities that will open doors from which we were shut out. They will excel on all their exams, thanks to the experienced guidance of private tutors and prep courses. They may even find themselves sitting on the same unreasonably overpriced lawn chairs in the Yard just as we did, discovering friends who traveled to the same extravagant countries as them. They will get to where we are today — but not from the same path we took.
Our kids will be better.
Isn’t that why we’re all here? Isn’t that why our parents came here? Somehow, by the sheer power of survival, we claimed our spots in an institution that was not meant for us. We eat, sleep, and study with people from all different walks of life, including ones we only fantasized about. When we graduate from these brick walls, we will have the opportunity to give our children the lives we never had and the privilege that we witnessed but could never touch. For many of us, we will be changing the tides of our generations, introducing newfound wealth and status. We will be paving a gilded road for our descendents, and it will be unprecedented. We are the first generation. And our kids will be even better.
So why does it feel so wrong?
Part of me wants to give my future child the secure, cushioned life I never had. Part of me grew up resenting those who had that lifestyle. Despite the struggles I’ve faced, I don’t regret any aspect of my upbringing, for it shaped me into who I am today. My childhood taught me how to empathize with someone else’s pain, how to always appreciate what I have, how to stay humble, and how to be patient in the face of adversaries. I want to spoil my child with a perfect life, but I consider the good, the bad, and even the ugly parts of my life to be the foundation of strengths and values that I consider to be more valuable than any luxury toy or extravagant vacation.
So what does it mean for my kid if they grow up shielded from these hardships? How do you raise a child to have a life that you yourself have never known? This is the greatest paradox I have grappled with during my time at Harvard. My four years at this institution will touch the lives of my children and my children’s children like a ripple of energy, and I have no idea what to expect. From the moment I stepped foot onto Harvard’s campus, I’ve been treading uncharted waters. Every decision I’ve made has been the first of its kind, regardless of whether it has been a step in the right direction or a catastrophic mistake. And wherever I end up after these years of blind, terrifying exploration will mark the spot where my child begins their life, too.
Our kids will indeed be better. But it’s up to us to understand what “better” truly means. We are the bridge between two spheres of life, bringing together generations of hardship with generations of opportunity. We are the ones who are most familiar with both sides, so it is up to us to translate the lessons of our past into the dreams of our future, lest we lose sight of the strength, survival, and struggles that have grounded our values and the values of those before us.

“Oh, you’re so lucky. If I didn’t have to worry about my career I’d concentrate in WGS too!” a male upperclassman said in a way that almost made it feel like a compliment. I couldn’t help but laugh at the irony of the timing. At the very moment he asked what my intended concentration was, I was rushing to a meeting with a pre-law advisor after a shift at my work-study job.
During my first semester of freshman year, I’ve shared with people both within and beyond Harvard that I intend to pursue a joint concentration in History & Literature and Studies of Women, Gender, & Sexuality, and I’ve been met with some unexpectedly inconsistent judgments about the practicality of concentration choice. And quite frankly, I’m already tired of it.
The negativity surrounding my concentration choice began on the day before I left home for pre-orientation with my allergist, who said, “You’re thinking of majoring in history? What do you want to be, a ski instructor?” and then laughed. I can’t ski, let alone can I even begin to address the extent to which that comment is problematic, offensive, and simply inaccurate.
The negativity continued in more subtle ways when I got to campus, when many of my peers seemed to establish a dichotomy between selecting a concentration that would lead to a successful and profitable future and choosing a concentration that they found intellectually engaging. I find that dichotomy problematic not only because I don’t believe it’s true, but also because it threatens the important role of intellectual curiosity in the classroom.
I’m already tired of fellow students commenting on how “lucky” I am to be interested in subjects that they assume are easier, less stressful, or supposedly permit grade inflation to a greater extent than other departments. I’m already tired of fellow students assuming that courses which are strictly content-based, such as math courses, are inherently superior to those that allow for, or even encourage, the inclusion of personal experience or subjective analysis in the pursuit of constructing more nuanced arguments, as many humanities courses do.
To be clear, I don’t believe I should have to justify my decision to follow my passions and choose the concentrations I’m most interested in. But the assumption that humanities or social sciences concentrations are “easy” is just plain wrong.
I discovered just how hard History & Literature would be after receiving extensive comments on my first essay for a class intended to prepare prospective Hist and Lit students for the concentration— comments that pushed me to deepen my analysis and tighten my argument in ways I’ve never been asked to consider before. Essays are all-encompassing in the best ways, and I find myself unable to pull myself away in the days I’m developing my argument. And I discovered just how hard WGS would be after reading two sentences of Judith Butler in a class this fall. Until you have read Judith Butler at midnight in preparation for a midterm, let’s not talk about how I should appreciate all the “free time” I have without 3-hour organic chemistry labs.
Many of my fellow students would argue that despite how difficult the humanities might truly be, other concentrations are simply more practical in the 21st century. Implicit in this argument is the belief that humanities concentrations do not prepare students for their future careers as well as science or math concentrations do. I don’t believe this is true. But even if it were, why would one try to dictate the future by prescribing decisions in the present?
The upperclassman who commented on my choice of concentration was connecting our current decisions and our future careers. The perception of concentrations as falling into two mutually exclusive camps — intellectually stimulating in the present but leading to a lifetime of financial struggle vs. unfulfilling in the present but leading to a future of wealth — assumes a narrow definition of success and removes the love of learning from our college experience. This view turns our Harvard experience into a transaction.
Of course, I can’t overlook that this upperclassman was specifically commenting on WGS as a concentration that was incompatible with a future career — or, at the very least, a lucrative future career. The inherent sexism of his comments suggesting that I, as a woman, was lucky that I didn’t need to worry about my future profession reinforces the very need for gender studies.
This is a very basic problem with a very basic solution. The fact that I have to say this is surprising, and the solution is in all of our hands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this year’s Harvard-Yale game, fans came to watch the teams in one of America’s oldest football rivalries. They were treated to a political stunt instead.
Dozens of Harvard and Yale students stormed the field at halftime to demand each school purge its endowments of fossil fuel assets and holdings of Puerto Rican debt, delaying the game by nearly an hour.
As president of the Harvard Republican Club, I share the protesters’ concern about climate change. Rising greenhouse gas emissions pose serious risks to the U.S. economy and must be addressed. However, in both style and substance, the divestment protesters missed the mark. Their approach won’t solve the climate problem and could even distract from the market-based solutions that will actually make a difference.
At its core, the divestment movement misconstrues the climate challenge. It unjustly demonizes fossil fuel companies as the sole culprits of climate change and falsely suggests that divesting endowments of their shares will improve the situation. It ignores the fact that we all use and benefit from fossil fuels on a daily basis — from the energy that powers pregame tailgates to the vehicles that carry students home after games.
It also ignores that divestment is essentially an act of financial theater. At its best, divestment has no impact on global emissions. (Even if divestment succeeded in weakening publicly-traded fossil fuel companies, there is compelling evidence that would increase emissions by shifting production to foreign, state-owned firms with worse environmental records.)
Instead of punishing fossil fuel companies, we should set clear incentives so that all parties — energy companies, businesses, and consumers — are encouraged to reduce emissions as quickly as possible. We need a commonsense national policy that brings all stakeholders together, not moralizing that drives them apart.
That is why the Harvard Republican Club joined student groups across the country in 2018 to endorse the carbon dividends climate solution. Advanced by Republican luminaries James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz, the carbon dividends plan would establish a gradually rising price on carbon to drive clean energy development across the economy. It would rebate all of the revenue to Americans in the form of dividends, ensuring that the vast majority — especially the most vulnerable — win economically from the U.S.’ climate response.
This simple, market-driven approach has earned remarkably broad support, including the backing of environmental non-governmental organizations and businesses, as well as the endorsement of thousands of economists — among them, an impressive 27 Nobel Prize winners.
And most importantly, the carbon dividends plan has drawn support from major fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil, BP, ConocoPhillips, and Shell. Contrary to what the divestment movement claims, climate advocates should not want these companies to fail. Instead, we should want these firms, propelled by the right incentives, to leverage their engineering expertise, innovative cultures, and vast research and development budgets to develop — and deploy — the technologies of the future. That is the path to protecting the environment and growing the economy at the same time.
The numbers speak for themselves. Assuming a starting carbon tax rate of $40 per ton (which the aforementioned companies support), the carbon dividends solution would deliver more than three times the emissions reductions of Obama-era regulations, easily exceeding the U.S.’ commitment under the Paris Agreement. Divestment, by contrast, offers little more than hot air.
At the Harvard Republican Club, and at college Republican chapters across the country, we are taking the climate issue seriously. According to a recent survey from Luntz Global — founded by famed Republican pollster Frank I. Luntz — 85 percent of Republicans under the age of 40 believe the GOP is hurting itself with younger voters due to its climate stance. (The poll also found that young conservatives support the carbon dividends solution by a seven-to-one margin.)
As young people, we know what is at stake for our economic prospects and for our generation. We also know that we need to focus on real solutions that unlock the innovative power of American business. While I commend the divestment protesters for their commitment to the cause, nobody wins from climate efforts that demonize the companies needed to help solve the problem.
Particularly at two of America’s leading universities, we should aspire for a more elevated understanding of the climate challenge — in all its complexity and nuance. We should seek solutions that are not only workable but also grounded in sound economic principles.
At the Harvard Republican Club, we will continue to discuss these important issues and bring people to our side through the merits of our arguments, rather than our ability to cause inconvenience. For those willing to engage in this important conversation, I and fellow young conservatives across the country stand ready to meet you there.
Wesley L. Donhauser ’21 is an Economics concentrator in Adams House. He the president of the Harvard Republican Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard prepares for its move into Allston, a new History of Science course will allow students to document the history expansion as it unfolds.
The course — titled History of Science 191cu: “Harvard’s Changing Landscapes: A Contemporary History Project” — will focus on the University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as it awaits its move to Allston. The seminar will be “project-based” and “designed to introduce students to the range of skills needed to research and document historical change while it is ‘in process,’” according to the course catalog.
The new SEAS complex is set to open in September 2020 in Allston and will likely house more than 1,800 researchers, students, and faculty.
The course will allow students to study SEAS on the eve of its move through project planning, background research, interview planning, audio recording, and editing.
Course instructor and History of Science lecturer David S. Unger said the idea for the class stemmed from his work as a historian in museums.
“I've worked on a number of documentation projects at various museums and now, as the Director of Administration for the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, I'd like to bring that kind of work here,” he said.
Unger also said that Harvard’s move to Allston offers a unique research opportunity for students to participate in a “real, practical project.” He said the goal of the course is “to collect oral histories and other documentation from SEAS.”
Information gathered by the students will be “part of a larger collecting initiative” and will become part of Harvard’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, according to the course description.
“I'm very interested in thinking about how the collection can actively collect objects and stories from things happening now,” Unger said.
In a statement, University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote that Harvard is “proud” of its presence in Allston more broadly.
“We are proud to be part of a vibrant innovative, artistic, and collaborative ecosystem that will change the region – and the world – in profound ways,” she said.
In previous years, Harvard’s expansion into Allston has invited significant pushback from the neighborhood's residents. Still, O’Rourke wrote that Harvard’s work in the area will allow the University to continue to contribute to the community and to promote innovation in the area.
“This progress and thoughtful planning – together with Harvard’s commitment to community and being a good neighbor – are ensuring the Boston area remains at the forefront of teaching, learning, and research, and that it remains a place where people want to live, learn, work, and play,” she wrote.
The course has an enrollment limit of 15 students and will be offered in the upcoming spring semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students across Harvard created a coalition demanding that Harvard stop displaying, publishing, and selling the rights to the images of two enslaved people late last year.
Created in December, the student group — dubbed the Harvard Coalition to Free Renty — seeks to spread student awareness about a lawsuit against Harvard centering on the daguerreotype photos, according to the group’s founder Meredith N. McKinney.
Tamara K. Lanier — who says she is Renty’s great-great-great-granddaughter — filed suit against Harvard in March, alleging that the University unlawfully possesses and profits from the photos, which depict an enslaved father and daughter named Renty and Delia. Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz commissioned the images in the 19th century to support his theory of white superiority. They are believed to be some of the oldest existing images of American slaves.
In her lawsuit, Lanier demanded the University give her the daguerreotypes, cede any profits made from them, and pay her punitive damages. She also asked that Harvard acknowledge “it was complicit in perpetuating and justifying the institution of slavery.”
McKinney, a Harvard Extension School student, said she began advocating for Lanier after she learned about the daguerreotypes through a course project. She started reaching out to student associations on campus and asking their leadership to inform members about Lanier’s case and the coalition’s efforts. The coalition currently comprises roughly 35 students across the University, according to McKinney.
“For Harvard to take a position where they're fighting against families to maintain ownership of that family's image and their history was deeply concerning to me as a student,” McKinney said.
“It bruised my pride in my affiliation with this University in a big way, big enough to make me start asking a lot of questions around campus and engaging with student associations,” she added.
The coalition has since been collecting signatures on an online petition calling on Harvard to cease using the images of Renty and Delia. The petition garnered more than 250 signatures as of Tuesday night.
In the coming months, the coalition plans to organize academic discussions about topics relevant to the case. Topics covered will include reparations, legal burdens placed on descendants of slaves to demonstrate lineage, and property laws that dictate how institutions like Harvard maintain ownership of family images.
Defending Harvard’s position in the lawsuit, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an April interview that the University legally possesses the images and that the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology displays them to convey the slaves’ humanity.
The lawsuit — along with other recent events — has forced Harvard to confront its fraught relationship with slavery.
Bacow and Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the United States are currently exploring educational partnerships after the country’s prime minister sent a letter to Bacow requesting reparations for the school’s ties to slavery.
Before Bacow’s tenure, former University President Drew G. Faust, along with United States Representative John R. Lewis (D-Ga.), dedicated a plaque to four enslaved persons who lived and worked on campus in the 18th century. Faust also accepted a Harvard Law School committee’s recommendation to remove and replace its seal, which previously featured the crest of the slaveholding Royall family.
Discussions about the slave trade's legacy at Harvard came to a head last year, when Bacow introduced a University-wide initiative to address and further research the school’s ties to slavery in November. Bacow selected Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin to head the initiative and named 12 additional faculty members to the presidential committee that she will chair.
While McKinney said the initiative is a “step in the right direction,” she said she was concerned about the lack of student representation on the faculty committee. She argued this makes the coalition’s efforts to bring students into the conversation still more important.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email that Brown-Nagin and the faculty committee have yet to determine the “scope” of the activities the initiative will undertake at this “early stage.”
“She and President Bacow are, however, both committed to seeing that students are engaged in the initiative,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Cambridge District Court judge arraigned two individuals on Friday after Cambridge police officers responded to a report of an armed man in Harvard Square and apprehended him and a woman in Central Square last week.
At approximately 3:20 p.m. on Jan. 16, the Cambridge Police Department apprehended Chayanne Velazquez, 28, of Dorchester, Mass. and Stephanie Ford, 25, of Lynn, Mass. after receiving a report of an armed man in the area of 36 JFK St. in Harvard Square. Police said in a press release that Velazquez was taken into custody after lifting his shirt to reveal a firearm in front of a group of men.
Police conducted a search and located Velazquez as well as a second suspect, Ford, in the area of Chipotle Mexican Grill in Central Square, according to a Cambridge police press release about the case.
CPD officers also took Ford into custody after they found a second loaded gun concealed inside her backpack.
Harvard sent an alert to University affiliates about the armed individual over the MessageMe system, asking those in the area to take shelter. CPD also tweeted about the presence of a “possible person with gun.”
Velazquez appeared in court Friday before Cambridge District Court First Justice Roanne Sragow for his arraignment, and was represented by attorney Jonathan Etesse.
After his arraignment on Friday, Sragow charged Velazquez with five separate counts related to a verbal altercation in Harvard Square during which he displayed a gun. The charges included assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a firearm without a license, carrying a loaded firearm without a license, threatening to commit a crime, and distributing Class B drugs, according to the Cambridge District Court clerk’s office.
Velazquez is currently being held without bail until his detention hearing, which is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on Jan. 23.
Ford, the second suspect arrested in connection with the Harvard Square gun incident was also arraigned on Friday. Ford faces three charges including carrying a firearm without a license, carrying a loaded firearm without a license, and distribution of Class B drugs, according to the Cambridge clerk’s office.
Ford’s bail was set at $2,500 on Friday and a pretrial hearing is scheduled for Feb. 14.
Last summer, Cambridge Police arrested a suspected armed man in Harvard Square who was wanted following a homicide in Philadelphia, Penn. The arrest occurred 30 minutes after Harvard affiliates received an alert there was a “potentially armed” individual near JFK and Eliot Streets.

Members of Harvard Business School’s African-American Alumni Association urged University President Lawrence S. Bacow in a letter earlier this month to prioritize diversity and inclusion in the search for the school’s next dean.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria announced in a November email to Business School affiliates that he will retire in June 2020 after ten years at the school’s helm.
In an email to University affiliates in November, Bacow and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced that 15 professors will serve on a search committee to select the next dean of the Business School. The group includes faculty from the Business School’s 10 academic units that comprise its primary fields of study.
The letter states that the group wants the search committee to seek out a candidate who will increase the number of African American participants in the school’s Master of Business Administration program, its executive education program, and its eight doctoral programs, according to an early January report from Black Enterprise.
The letter also asks that the next dean of the Business School prioritize existing programs dedicated to supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.
The letter states that the next Business School dean should increase African American representation among the school’s faculty and senior administrators.
The letter also states that HSBAAA believes Business School leadership should make an effort to increase the number of African Americans central to the case studies taught to Business School students.
Nohria oversaw a 2015 push to double the number of female protagonists in case studies by 2019. More recently, in March 2019, HBS administrators announced plans to hire an Associate Director for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging in response to concerns about a lack of diversity among characters in case studies.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email to The Crimson that Bacow has responded to the letter sent by the HBSAAA.
“In his response he said he appreciates the effort and energy that members of the HBSAAA have invested, and continue to invest, in advancing diversity and inclusion across HBS—both its people and its programs,” Newton wrote. “He also noted that advancing diversity and inclusion will remain an essential aim of the school in the years ahead, and that it is beneficial to have the HBSAAA’s observations in the context of the dean search and more generally.”
Nohria declined to comment through Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny on the search for his successor.

Cambridge will allocate $1.125 million from its fiscal year 2021 budget to fund eight public space improvement projects proposed by residents, according to the Cambridge Participatory Budgeting website.
These projects include initiatives to plant 100 trees in Cambridge, provide free water bottle filling stations in the major squares, and build a third standalone public restroom in the city.
The participatory budgeting process aims to improve public spaces and foster civic engagement by encouraging residents to propose community-oriented projects. Soliciting resident input helps ensure that the city’s budget “reflects the priorities of Cambridge residents,” according to the Participatory Budgeting website.
The sixth participatory budgeting cycle in Cambridge ran from May to December 2019. The city included 20 out of over 1,600 proposals submitted on the final ballot. Both Cambridge residents 12 years and older — regardless of citizenship status — and university students living in the city were eligible to vote for their top five proposal choices in December.
Over 7,600 residents voted on the final ballot, marking the highest voter turnout yet for the participatory budget process in Cambridge, according to the Participatory Budgeting website.
A proposal entitled “Close the Canopy” won the most support, receiving over 4,600 votes. Under this proposal, the city will plant 100 trees in areas of Cambridge with the lowest canopy cover — an initiative the city expects to cost $200,000.
The project description states that trees are “among the best ways to combat climate change and reduce the urban heat island effect,” in which the modification of land surfaces in urban areas leads to significantly higher temperatures.
An initiative to install water bottle filling stations in the major squares of Cambridge garnered the second highest number of votes. In 2018, residents voted to install water stations in every park in Cambridge. In the most recent cycle, the city will allocate $150,000 to add stations to city squares, which are high-traffic areas for residents, workers, students, and tourists.
A $350,000 proposal to build a third standalone outdoor public restroom in a high foot traffic area is the highest-budget approved this cycle. The city plans to install a “Portland Loo,” a specially designed restroom that is both easy to clean and a crime deterrent .
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, who will fully fund the public restroom project, said in a December press release that participatory budgeting encourages Cantabrigians to rethink ways they can be involved.
“When people think about finance and the budget process, they don’t necessarily think about community engagement, but we continue to change that perspective with Participatory Budgeting,” DePasquale said in the press release.
“Through PB, residents are not only empowered with the ability to submit and vote for capital projects, they are also able to get a closer look at how the budget process works and how decisions are made,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard undergraduate Damilare Sonoiki ’13 opposed Harvard’s motion to dismiss his lawsuit last Friday, alleging the College unfairly refused to grant him his bachelor’s degree.
On Oct. 21, 2019, Sonoiki filed a suit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts arguing Harvard should not have withheld his degree after three fellow students accused him of sexual assault. The Administrative Board — which adjudicated complaints of sexual harassment in 2013 — ultimately found the allegations against Sonoiki credible and recommended his dismissal.
Sonoiki did not receive his degree because of the pending Ad Board review of the first two allegations, though he spoke as the Harvard Orator on Class Day and walked at graduation. Five days after Commencement, a third woman filed an additional complaint against him.
The Administrative Board eventually found Sonoiki responsible for the conduct he was accused of on Nov. 19, 2013 and recommended that the Faculty Council dismiss him from the College. The Council later assented.
The University filed its motion to dismiss Sonoiki’s suit in December. On Jan. 17, Sonoiki’s lawyers opposed the motion.
Sonoiki’s lawyers wrote in the opposition that Harvard subjected him to “a byzantine process without jurisdiction” as they reviewed the allegations of sexual misconduct and decided whether he would receive his diploma.
“Rather than addressing the crux of the Complaint, Harvard misrepresents not just Damilare’s claims, falsely suggesting that he seeks criminal trial-like rights, but even its own documents. As discussed below, these misrepresentations should leave the Court exasperated,” they wrote.
Sonoiki expected to receive his degree and for the Ad Board to lose jurisdiction. He alleges that the University denied him his choice of personal advisor, according to the opposition to the motion.
“This Court should deny the Motion because the Handbook required the Ad Board to issue charges against Damilare prior to his graduation,” it reads. “Although it is unclear when the student-Harvard relationship first forms, the Handbook shows that it ends upon graduation.”
The handbook stated at the time that “a degree will not be granted to a student who is not in good standing or against whom a disciplinary charge is pending,” according to the opposition.
“While a complaint is a claim of wrongdoing brought to Harvard’s attention, a ‘disciplinary charge’ is an affirmative act by the Ad Board,” it reads. “The Ad Board may issue disciplinary charges following a preliminary investigation, or it ‘may independently initiate a charge against a student,’ without investigation. The Ad Board could conceivably issue disciplinary charges even a minute before a student’s graduation.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email to The Crimson that the College does not comment on pending litigation, but that College policy forbids students subject to pending disciplinary action from graduating. She added that the College does not tolerate sexual misconduct.
"Harvard College is deeply committed to providing a supportive and inclusive environment for members of our community and will not tolerate sexual misconduct including rape and other forms of sexual assault,” Dane wrote.
A hearing in the case — and on the motion — is scheduled for Feb. 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Management Company adjusted its natural resource portfolio this week by purchasing a minority stake in produce company Westfalia Fruit International and selling its investments in two Australian farms.
HMC — the University’s investment arm — manages Harvard's endowment, which is currently valued at $40.9 billion. HMC’s natural resource investments, which comprised 4 percent of the endowment, saw 12.4 percent losses in fiscal year 2019, compared to 6.5 percent returns on all investments that year.
HMC aimed to “refine” its natural resources assets after the endowment’s value dropped almost $2 billion during the 2016 fiscal year. HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar wrote in the University’s Financial Report for Fiscal Year 2019 that one of the company’s goals was to “reduce our exposure to natural resources.”
Since Narvekar took over as CEO in Dec. 2016, HMC has decreased its natural resource assets by more than half. In the 2019 financial report, Narvekar wrote that HMC “completely rebuilt” a team to manage these investments.
Westfalia Fruit — a multinational company specializing in avocado production — announced the sale to HMC in a press release on Friday.
“The decision to partner with HMC was an easy one, given our similar values and commitment to sustainable business principles,” Alk Brand, the CEO of Westfalia, said in the release. “This transaction positions us well for pursuing strategic objectives within the global Group and significantly contributes towards our vision of being a leader in the global avocado industry.”
HMC’s Managing Director of Natural Resources Colin Butterfield said in the release that HMC is “excited” for the opportunity to work with Westfalia.
“Westfalia is a global leader in the avocado market with a commitment to environmentally sustainable management,” Butterfield said. “Its vertically integrated operations are uniquely positioned to benefit from the growth in global avocado consumption and make it a great fit for our portfolio.”
Vertical integration is a strategy where companies own the supply chain for their products. Westfalia’s vertically integrated supply chain allows them to “grow, source and ripen, pack, process and market quality avocados and other produce – across the year and across the globe,” according to its website.
Andrew A. Whitman — the Director of the Sustainable Economies Program at Manomet, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on sustainability — cited vertical integration as a reason Westfalia is a “quality investment” for HMC. Whitman said vertical integration allowed for products to become “more profitable” and “more resilient, in terms of things like climate change.”
In addition to its investment in Westfalia, HMC sold its investments in a cotton farm and almond farm in New South Wales to to the Boston-based Hancock Agricultural Investment Group for more than $120 million Monday, according to the Australian Financial Review.
The continuous properties cover around 77 square miles and include cotton, wheat, barley, and canola crops, as well as an almond orchard.
Whitman said HMC may have sold these investments due to water scarcity in Australia.
“Australia is, in some areas, something of a water challenged environment,” he said. “My hunch is that it's making a lot of investors review their investments there carefully to understand whether or not they're well situated to continue in that environment.”
Despite the challenges, Whitman said the properties are not necessarily “bad investments.”
“It may be that Harvard found that they were not well positioned to make the most of those investments,” he said.
So far, HMC has sold over $1.1 billion of “good, but misaligned” natural resource assets to “more appropriate investors,” per the 2019 report. Narvekar wrote in the report that HMC expected to close on the sale of “close to another $200 million” of these assets in the remainder of the fiscal year.
Correction: Jan. 23, 2020
A previous version of this article stated that Andrew A. Whitman is the the Director of the Stable Economies Program at Manomet. In fact, he directs the Sustainable Economies Program.
