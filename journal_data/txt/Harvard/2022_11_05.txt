After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite being the smallest state in the world both by area and population, the Vatican attracted over 5 million visitors every year before the Covid pandemic. Its modest 121 acres are home to some of the world's most significant historical moments, including Michelangelo’s painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and Galileo’s declaration of the Heliocentric theory. The pandemic, however, significantly limited travelers’ ability to explore this concentration of religious and cultural symbolism. And even before the pandemic, complete artistic immersion required thorough planning and intentional travel.
To bridge that gap between accessibility and authentic artistic appreciation, Lighthouse Immersive — a multimedia curation company — has unveiled its "Immersive Vatican" exhibit at the Lighthouse ArtSpace in Boston. Now, for the rough price of an expensive meal out, guests can enjoy a guided historical excursion that spans the catacombs, crusades, biblical scenes, historical events, sculpture, architectural spreads, and vibrant frescoes.
Though the exhibit and its format necessarily skews the intended artistic experience of the artworks featured due to their being enlarged and removed from their original context, the Immersive exhibit makes up for this by providing a uniquely intimate experience. By looking at a piece projected in all its magnificent colors on a huge wall, viewers receive a more nuanced and arguably authentic reading and interpretation of a work than they would by cramming into a crowded facility to see it hung in a small frame guarded by police.
Some viewers may also question the commercialization of religious themes — a feature absent in previous Immersive exhibits. Many past Immersive shows, such as those that highlighted the works of Monet and Van Gogh, have revolved around individual famed artists. The Vatican, on the other hand, in addition to displaying historic art and architecture, serves as the headquarters of the Catholic Church. The curators, then, must walk the line of honoring the religion without fetishizing the art and appreciating the art without minimizing the spiritual undertones.
The creative force behind the exhibit, curator Massimiliano Siccardi, who is Italian and Catholic, obviously weighed this religious aspect as a powerful presence of the culture on display but not the singular focus. The show includes catacombs, popes, and crusades, but is by no means devoted to them. Immersive Vatican carefully honors the natural tie between the history of art and religion for this time period without objectifying it.
Further, there is one significant historical figure present in the exhibit who skirts around the religious themes of the time. Works from famed Italian painter Caravaggio, who is known for his body of non-religious work, are included in the show to demonstrate the diversity of artists working during the time period.
This theme of honoring and acknowledging yet also appreciating and deconstructing is seen not only in the thought put into the chronology and storytelling of the Immersive exhibit but also in every detail of the show. For example, the minute strokes of paint audiences see running through the montages at strategic points in the exhibit may at first glance seem like creative transitions, but they are actually an homage to how Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: lying down with streaks of paint running into his eyes. The architecture of the transitions thus mirrors the physical experience of having paint run into your eyes and face when painting a chapel ceiling. Such historical nuances are introduced into the show due to the hard work of a large staff of researchers and historians based in Italy.
Every minute of the exhibit is packed with historical nuance, cultural references, and glorious eye candy. The colors are illuminated brilliantly, the storyline is laid out strategically, and the whole experience brings a sense of wonder and reverence for humankind. The experience is immersive in every sense of the word, and it should be included on every history buff’s, art critic’s, or just general museum-goers' list of things to see in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo wrapped up Halloweekend with two more wins against Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Crimson is back on a two game win streak after going 2-2 the prior weekend during its trip to California, where they fought well against multiple top-ten ranked opponents.
“I think I speak for everyone that our California trips are the most anticipated games of the season. Being able to go back home, for most of us, and playing outdoors again, getting tan and seeing our families is a highlight every season,” reflected senior goalie Noah Hodge. “Being at home for games definitely has its benefits and the plane rides do take a toll on recovery, but in my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons.”
Harvard (17-7, 7-1 Northeast Water Polo Conference) started the match off strong against Brown (13-2, 3-4 NWPC) with two goals from sophomore center Mot Stothart and first-year utility player James Rozolis-Hill.
“Our chemistry and overall cohesion makes our team different from the other teams we’re playing against. From the seniors all the way down to the first-years, like myself, we all truly care for one another and have each other’s back through everything … We believe that we are talented enough to play and beat any team in the country,” said Rozolis-Hill when asked about his first season of experience with the program and what makes this team so successful.
Going into the second quarter, the Crimson was up 2-1 before Stothart scored his third goal of the game to make it 3-1, before junior center Kaleb Archer and junior attacker Owen Hale, brought the score back up to a two point lead with 5-3.
“Home games are always the best. You can’t replicate the feeling of defending your home pool in front of family and friends,” said Rozolis-Hill.
Harvard scored five more goals in the third quarter, before hanging on to secure the 10-8 victory in the fourth.
“So far I’m pretty happy with how our team has performed this season. I think a lot of our successes this season can be attributed to how close we all are outside of the pool,” remarked Hodge, who recently set and continues to add to the program record for most career saves.
“Over the last five years I’ve been able to see just how important team chemistry is to our success as a program. Being an Ivy League school and having limited recruiting spots and thus a smaller roster, it’s that much more important that every member of the team is contributing in the best way they can.”
The Crimson carried its success in the first game into their next match against MIT (6-14, 1-7 NWPC), where the home team took another win at Blodgett Pool, 18-10 against the Beavers.
Early in the first quarter Harvard started its offense off strong, taking a 4-1 lead before extending the gap even further to 11-3 before halftime, which was key as the Beavers exhibited a valiant effort the second half of the game.
This past weekend kept the Crimson half a game behind first-place Princeton in the NWPC, and following Harvard’s 2021 season, where the team attained its third-highest win total in program history, the anticipation for the remainder of the season is high.
“We have a lot of upperclassmen, including three super-seniors, leading the way and setting the example for our underclassmen who have stepped into their roles,” said Hodge. “I’m super excited for the rest of the season as we head into the conference tournament and truly believe we’ll be able to bring home a ring.”
“This year I’ve felt a different energy compared to last year and I’m truly grateful that we were able to get last season under our belts. It was tough coming out of Covid, basically having half of our team being brand new to college water polo, and it took time for us to adjust, get to know the new players, and get into a groove. However, now with a year under our belts, we’ve hit our stride and the team is clicking on another level.”
This weekend the Crimson will play both St. Francis College Brooklyn and Iona College on Saturday before defending Blodgett against the Princeton Tigers on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Right now, Harvard football is knotted up with Penn and Yale in the Ivy League standings, two heavyweights who have only taken one loss in the conference and look to be the only other teams who could potentially steal the league crown from undefeated Princeton. The Crimson (5-2, 3-1) will play both those rivals in this final three-week stretch of the season, but this weekend, it will have to wait to prove its conference mettle, as it takes on struggling Columbia (3-4, 0-4) at home on Saturday.
After a lopsided loss to the Tigers two weekends ago, the Crimson kept its championship hopes alive by putting away another conference rival, Dartmouth, last Saturday, a game that the team played without starting signal-caller Charlie Dean. The senior and Odessa, Fla. native was banged up from the loss against Princeton but is expected to return this season. His back-up, senior quarterback Luke Emge, capitalized on the rapport he built over four games last season with senior star wideout Kym Wimberly and managed the Dartmouth game admirably overall, throwing for 196 yards on 17 attempts, a touchdown to Wimberly, and one interception. The defense held the lead despite the Big Green’s unconventional two-quarterback scheme, which has historically given the unit fits.
“We'd been really working on our aggressiveness and our physicality, honing in on our techniques and also just making sure that we had no mental mistakes,” said junior lineman and defensive stalwart Thor Griffith of the victory.
If Dean is back behind center on Saturday, the Crimson will likely return to a more balanced offensive attack after leaning heavily on its running game last week. Luckily, it may have an easier time gaining yards through the air against the Lions, who come to Cambridge on the heels of three consecutive losses. In two of those games, against Penn and Yale, they allowed more than 300 passing yards in 20-plus point losses; in the other, a close bout against Dartmouth, Columbia erased a 15-point deficit in the second half only to lose on a 32-yard field goal as time expired. The Lions have struggled to play complete football games during their month-long skid, as they were shut out in the first half against the Quakers and in the second half against the Bulldogs.
Columbia will place its offensive hopes on senior quarterback Caden Bell, who has been forced to air the ball out more in his past two games as the team mounted late-game comeback attempts. Bell took over for junior quarterback and former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Joe Green midway through the game against Penn, instantly making an impact to the tune of 2 touchdowns and a 72 percent completion rate on 18 attempts. But against Dartmouth and Yale, Bell’s numbers dipped, as he went 16 for 23 against the Big Green and then just 22 for 41 in the blowout loss to the Bulldogs.
In contrast to Harvard, whose offense has mainly run through Wimberly and senior running back Aidan Borguet, Columbia’s air and ground attacks have seen a rotating cast of playmakers emerge. In their Oct. 8 win against Wagner, senior running back Ryan Young had a career-best showing, gashing the Seahawks for 117 yards, which he followed up two weeks later with an even better performance against Dartmouth. Yet the Lions have also given ample opportunities to junior Joey Giorgi, a slightly taller and quicker back who led the team in carries against Yale. Giorgi also has become involved in the passing game, which is spearheaded by the wide receiver duo of Bryson Canty and JJ Jenkins, who rank fourth and sixth in Ivy League receiving yards, respectively.
Despite their versatility in personnel, the Lions will likely still face an uphill battle to score points against a Harvard defense that has momentum on its side. Save for two touchdown drives at the tail end of the second quarter against Dartmouth, the Crimson was suffocating against the Big Green, especially in the run game. Dartmouth managed to gain only six rushing yards during the entire second half, an effort that was anchored by strong performances from senior linebacker Jake Brown, who racked up eight tackles, as well as senior defensive lineman and team captain Truman Jones. Jones added to this season’s growing collection of memorable special teams plays when he blocked an extra-point against the Big Green, the seventh block for the Crimson.
Time of possession, the turnover battle, and third-down defense will be X-factors in this contest, as Harvard will try to add to its middling four takeaways on the season against a team which has the worst turnover differential (-10) in the Ivy League. Whether Harvard can jump out to a lead and rely on Borguet to keep the offense on the field will also be indicative — the two games that the Crimson have dropped this season are also the only two games in which the senior failed to eclipse the century mark on the ground, a sign of just how dominant he has played but also the extent to which the offense relies on him. Finally, the Harvard defense has allowed teams to move the chains on third downs at a concerning 43.8 percent clip, which could portend for especially poor results against the Lions offense, which converts an even half of those opportunities, good for tenth in the FCS.
“The first thing that we have to do is limit their yardage on first and second downs, so that we avoid those third and shorts,” Griffith explained. “Then if we get in those situations, it’s about hunkering down and making sure they can’t get to the inside run.”
The spotlight will be on the defensive lineman with a superhero’s name and the rest of his squad, as Harvard’s 1 p.m. bout against the Lions will be aired on ESPN+.
