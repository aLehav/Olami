After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having begun her political career as a high profile district attorney in San Francisco, Democratic presidential hopeful and California Senator Kamala D. Harris can certainly claim to represent “San Francisco values.” However, her local popularity has yet to translate into national support. Before Thursday’s debate, Harris was only polling in the high single digits in national and early state primary polls — a disappointment compared to an early polling bump when she threw her hat into the ring. My vote is far from settled, but, as a lifetime San Francisco resident, I’m intrigued.
Working against Harris is the constant refrain that she isn’t authentic enough. This past March, admittedly early in the cycle, I co-led a focus group of college students in my work with a national Harvard poll of young voter political opinions. The participants agreed that Harris didn’t seem genuine. Curious, I conducted an informal poll of my friends, and the consensus was the same. Some of that is certainly sexism (though I’ve heard it from audiences of different genders). Some of it is a legitimate reaction to the about-face that all politicians do when they update their policy stances to the current moment.
But we might want to consider attributing another part of her perceived lack of authenticity to something in the electorate — an inability to understand multiracial identity. With almost 3 percent of Americans self-reporting a mixed-race background in the 2010 census, many voters have very limited exposure to multiracial Americans (although the numbers are growing and a multiracial candidate like Harris may have even more natural support in another decade or two).
Harris is the daughter of immigrants; her father is from Jamaica, and her mother from India. To a multiracial student like me, it’s an appealing story. I still remember being disappointed as a kid that Barack Obama’s media narrative focused on his role as the first black president — I wanted to claim him for my own as the first multiracial president. My paternal relatives may have come from a different part of India than Harris’ mother, my maternal relatives from countries not represented in her background, but I still feel the natural excitement of a candidate who looks a bit more like me than the people who came before.
Cultural pluralism is a key ingredient in that liberal, West Coast political amalgam known as “San Francisco values.” Accordingly, being multiracial may have been an asset to Harris in California, where she handily won elections for state attorney general and U.S. Senate in a state with twice the share of multiracial residents as the rest of the country. But Harris’ presidential bid clearly doesn’t see her multiracial background as an asset in a national election — the biography on her campaign website makes no reference to her parents or ethnic background.
Perhaps this is a miscalculation. Without enough exposure to the story of her background, many voters don’t know what to make of Harris’ code-switching — the way people with multicultural backgrounds adjust their manners and dialect in order to fit their environmental context. When Harris posts Instagram videos that lean into her black heritage, voters who are used to seeing her speak as though she’s surrounded by old white men — in her role as attorney general or senator — might be taken aback and assume that this is an inauthentic affectation. Unaccustomed to multiracial identity, Harris is seen as “acting black” in this context; though Harris need not prove her race, these voters forget the obvious cultural credential that Harris attended historically black Howard University. When some of these same voters turn to scrutinizing her record as attorney general, she’s suddenly not “black enough,” because of past endorsements of tough-on-crime policies of the kind that disproportionately affect people of color.
This “multiracial confusion” may contribute to her authenticity problem. For most people, this response is somewhat innocent, if tinged with implicit bias. But an uglier version was on display this weekend during the racist backlash to Harris’ dominant debate performance. Reprising the birtherist conspiracies aimed by his father at then-candidate Obama, Donald J. Trump Jr. questioned Harris’ blackness in a roundly criticized tweet.
To double down on her recent rise in the polls, Harris may want to consider speaking more about her identity. I certainly don’t endorse catering to the Trumps, who have weaponized race for political gain, but everyone from moderate Trump supporters to the “wokest” among us might find Harris more authentic if we understood more about her background. (It’s unfortunate that white candidates don’t face this same burden.)
And, fellow liberals: Check yourselves. Consider how race may factor into your perception of Harris, and reevaluate her authenticity problem with voters. Why not give her the benefit of the doubt?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Justice Department lawyer recently suggested in court that the federal government should not be required to provide toothbrushes and soap for detained children apprehended at the border. The children in these detention centers are locked in cages and deprived of regular showers; some as young as eight have been forced to care for toddlers. Six have died in United States custody since September.
The inhabitants of these detention centers are not criminals; many have applied for asylum and credibly demonstrated a fear of persecution if they return to their native countries. Asylum seekers can legally reside in the US until their court hearings.
Our imprisonment of asylum seekers is a natural extension of an immigration policy that deprives foreigners of basic human rights. All policies that restrict immigration limit free association and exchange.
If allowed into the US, many immigrants would find Americans willing to hire, house, or rent to them. When the government restricts immigration, it bans these voluntary transactions just because one party is a foreigner. In doing so, it prevents prospective immigrants from improving their own lives through free exchange and forces Americans to discriminate against foreigners.
Harvard, for example, admits students with no regard to their immigration status. But for years, talented young people from across the world have missed their opportunity to attend because federal immigration policy prevents them from escaping poverty and violence in their native countries.
Harvard’s admissions policy recognizes that a lack of documentation should not limit opportunity. The US should learn from Harvard and open its borders to anyone who wants to immigrate. This would require repealing all border controls, visa requirements, and restrictions on legal entry, with a potential exception for narrow security screenings.
The US and Harvard both benefit when they admit immigrants. In the U.S., immigrants start new businesses at twice the rate of native-born Americans, and economic research consistently shows that immigration increases economic output. This year, a Harvard student became the first undocumented immigrant to win a Rhodes scholarship.
Philosopher Michael Huemer famously argues that all immigration restrictions would violate common-sense morality if practiced by ordinary individuals. He gives the example of Marvin, a man in desperate need of food, who goes to buy bread at the local market. The baker is willing to sell Marvin bread. But Sam, a bystander, decides to detain Marvin on his way to the market and forcibly prevent him from buying bread. Marvin returns home empty-handed and dies of starvation.
In this example, we would certainly argue that Sam harmed Marvin, and we would hold Sam largely responsible for Marvin’s death. Likewise, we should hold the federal government largely responsible for the deaths and suffering of people who could have saved themselves by freely transacting in the United States.
If New York imprisoned immigrants from Kansas, we would argue that it violates Kansans’ right to free association. Why are federal restrictions more acceptable?
One could argue that the US has a responsibility to prioritize the welfare of its citizens. But so does the state of New York. And the fact that the federal government should prioritize its own citizens does not justify violating the rights of others; most parents house and feed their own children, but they do not imprison other people’s children.
Consider also the argument that the federal government has the right to “enforce its borders.” On face, this seems reasonable; after all, I have the right to keep kids off my lawn. But if the government can prevent me from hiring an immigrant or subletting my room to one, then I do not really own my business or my house; the government does. And the next time the government wants to demolish someone’s home to build offices for a corporation, it is welcome to do so.
Proponents of restrictions claim that immigration drains the welfare budget. Surely, aiding the poor and persecuted is more important than keeping the level of federal benefits constant. And the law already limits immigrants’ access to welfare: legal residents cannot receive benefits for at least five years, and with few exceptions undocumented immigrants cannot receive them at all.
Immigrants are also less likely to use welfare than native-born Americans and, when they do, use a lower dollar value of benefits. At most, this argument may justify excluding non-citizens from federal benefits, but it is not a reason to limit immigration.
All sides of the political spectrum should reconsider their support for restricting immigration. The federal government’s treatment of immigrants may be the single largest human rights violation occurring within our borders.
For Democrats, opening our borders should be a top priority. Free association is a more fundamental right than free healthcare, and helping the global poor escape persecution is more important than canceling the student loans of college-educated Americans.
Republicans who oppose illegal immigration should also wholeheartedly support open borders. After all, the easiest way to eliminate illegal immigration is to legalize immigration.
The US should learn from Harvard and recognize that everyone benefits when we welcome talented, hard-working people from all over the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first read the article titled “Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation” by Dean Fitzsimmons of Admissions and Financial when it was sent along with my admissions letter, encouraging students to take a gap year: “Yet the paradox is that the only road to real success is to become more fully oneself, to succeed in the field and on the terms that one defines for oneself.”
Yes, let’s take a moment to chuckle at the irony that Harvard says we should define our own success, and ignore the recruiting coffee chats on our email list-servs, and dance to the beat of our drum around a fire lit by our transcripts. But then, I invite you to consider reading the letter again. Because if you’re reading this, I hope it means there’s a part of you that’s curious about taking a gap year or semester. Though the article seems radical or even contradictory for Harvard, there is truth in it, along with growing acceptance around gap years in America. In all honesty, isn’t it strange to transition directly from high school to higher education without any breaks, added experience, or new perspectives?
Let me first acknowledge there are many reasons, beyond our control, why students take a leave of absence, like for health or family concerns. And there are many for whom gap years are not feasible, such as for timing or financial reasons. Therefore a voluntary gap year is a luxury. It is a true privilege to deliberately carve time to dedicate to your personal growth. If you are lucky enough in this lifetime to have the means to consider a gap year — and have an inkling of interest — let me entice you.
Like my parents and my resident dean, I’m sure you might be wondering, “Why did you do it?” I will outline some of the main reasons why, big and small. To be clear, this is not a vent about Harvard. I only came to these conclusions because of a tipping point when I lifted my head out of the water and realized, in a rush of meta-awareness, that I was wildly off-track. My gap year was the beginning of contemplation, one I hope you will join with me, of the structures we exist in and whether they serve us, and whether we are serving ourselves.
I took a gap year because I felt a deep friction I couldn’t name until I was away. I didn’t have solid grounding in myself and was swept up in the fastest current, carried away by the lure of big money in big cities. Deep inside, I knew I didn’t want that, but what did I want? I had no idea what was fulfilling work to me. Everyone talks about a career path, but how can I be on a “path” if I felt aimless? I needed to experience what was out there.
I took a gap year because I wanted time with my family... and to sleep. I wanted to learn how to cook my mom’s best eggplant recipes.
I took a gap year because I had no idea what my values were. On this front, I think Harvard fails to provide a true “liberal arts education” that best prepares students for life after college. We are pushed intellectually, but what about the emotional, human part? The part when we imagine the kind of person, not professional, we want to become? There’s a reason why students have the attitude that general education classes are throw away “gem” classes and not places to further character or explore interests and issues outside of their major. Because of this, I strongly believed that anything I missed at school would be outweighed by the insight I would gain on my gap year. I would get the kind of education I need, now.
I took a gap year because I finally wanted time to write poetry.
I took a gap year because I knew I couldn’t continue at the pace I was going. My well-being and self-confidence were suffering and I was failing the people I love on campus.
I took a gap year because I couldn’t handle the constantly turning wheel of competitive productivity. I didn’t know my own limits and I lifted my head up on a Thursday, alone mid-dinner, and realized I hadn’t had a real conversation with anyone in the past week. I was living like I was just skimming the surface and everything was gliding by. I never strayed from my tightly packed Google calendar to consider the world around me. I never thought about how my actions affected other people or the planet or ventured to create things. I was never political. I never questioned what was established and I wanted to cultivate audacity and awareness to recognize needed change.
I took a gap year because I wasn’t mature enough to be at school. I wanted to seriously commit to understanding myself, but I knew I couldn’t do that at Harvard. I felt trapped underneath the labels of a “Harvard introduction” and a one page resume. I had to understand what I was like out of my element, when uncomfortable and meeting a new group of people. I wondered whether I could sit alone with myself and decided I would try solo travelling. When things came down to the wire, could I trust myself? Did I have an inner voice? What did she sound like and did I even like her? For the first time in a long time, when I decided to take my gap year, I listened to that voice.
If you have ever felt like this, consider taking a gap year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the days following the Harvard Kennedy School’s announcement Friday that former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder had been named a senior research fellow, Harvard students, faculty, and those unaffiliated with the University quickly jumped to criticize the move.
Snyder, who left office Jan. 1, is widely known for his role in the Flint, Mich. water crisis. During his time as governor, he appointed the officials who oversaw changes to the city’s water source that led to dangerous lead contamination. An outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in the city resulted from the change, infecting 90 people and killing 12.
Snyder’s appointment Friday at the Kennedy School’s Taubman Center for State and Local Government swiftly led to backlash on social media. Harvard students and faculty were among those who voiced outrage about the decision, calling on Taubman Center director Jeffrey B. Liebman to rescind Snyder’s fellowship through an email campaign and change.org petition.
In the Kennedy School’s initial press release announcing Snyder’s appointment, Liebman said that he expects Snyder will bring “significant expertise” in management and public policy. The release referenced Snyder leading Detroit through the “largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history,” and expanding Michigan’s workforce training and STEM education programs. It made no mention of the Flint water crisis.
Mo Torres, a doctoral fellow in the Kennedy School’s Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy, said he was in “disbelief” when he heard about Snyder’s appointment. In 2017, Torres said the Taubman Center offered him $2,500 to study the consequences of Michigan's Public Act 4, which Torres said sparked Flint’s water crisis.
“As a direct consequence of Rick Snyder's actions, there's been an entire generation of Flint children that have been poisoned with lead contaminated water,” Torres said.
“I would love to see a governor appointed to HKS who has aimed to live up to high ethical standards, who has learned from their mistakes, who always privileges vulnerable people in society,” he added. “Governor Snyder is just not any of those things.”
Timothy P. McCarthy — a lecturer at the Kennedy School — took to Twitter to question the school’s decision. In a response to a tweet questioning the appointment, he wrote that the decision was “beyond me.”
“Perhaps you should ask the administration at @Kennedy_School — they may be able to tell you why a man who is under legal investigation for poisoning a city full of black folks is coming to teach our students,” he wrote. “It’s honestly beyond me.”
In an effort to cut costs, Michigan shifted Flint’s water source from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the polluted Flint River in 2014. Investigations later revealed that Snyder lied about when he first knew that Flint’s water was unsafe, and implemented emergency procedures only months after he was made aware.
Kennedy School affiliates have not been alone in questioning the school’s decision to appoint Snyder — in a public statement on their website, the Harvard College Democrats wrote that Snyder’s appointment was a “direct endorsement of Governor Snyder’s racist legacy.”

The group’s president, Henry “Hank” R. Sparks ’21, said the organization issued the statement knowing the “devastating” impact that Snyder’s decisions had on the city.

“We're really disappointed to see Harvard not only give a platform to someone with that record but also to honor him,” Sparks said. “Fellowships can be a way to honor people. And in our case, we don't think he's deserving of the honor.”
Tiffani A. Bell, a former fellow at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center, said she thought the school was sending the “wrong message” by expecting students to learn from Snyder.
“It’s telling people you can basically fail up,” she said. “You can literally kill people in your governing and fail and Harvard will still think that you have something to offer people.
Bell created a change.org petition — which garnered over 5,500 signatures as of Tuesday evening — asking Liebman to rescind Snyder’s fellowship.
In a message Liebman sent to many who have written to him, he wrote that the Kennedy School does not “endorse” its fellows’ words or actions. He added that Snyder will “undoubtedly face hard questions” from students during his time at Harvard.
“At the Kennedy School, we aim to learn from both the successes and failures of public officials,” he wrote. “Having public officials on campus allows our students to ask those officials hard questions, and we believe that it prepares our students to have more successes and fewer failures when they become leaders.”
Kennedy School spokesperson Norah Delaney declined to comment on criticism’s about Snyder’s appointment. Snyder did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.
This is not the first time Harvard has invited controversial public figures to its campus. In 2017, hundreds of alumni protested the Institute of Politics for choosing Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer — two former aides to President Donald Trump — as visiting fellows.
Though the IOP did not rescind their fellowships, it did withdraw another appointment in 2017: Chelsea E. Manning, a former U.S. soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks lost her fellowship after CIA director Mike Pompeo refused to attend a speaking engagement at the IOP in protest.
Snyder began his appointment Monday. As a fellow, he will study, teach, and write about issues related to state and local governments, according to the original announcement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Customs and Border Patrol entered into a $150,000 contract with Brigham and Women’s Hospital — a major teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School — on June 17 after the money was first mistakenly allocated to Harvard.
The funds from the contract were allocated to Michael J. VanRooyen, the chief of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, to consult with CBP about medical service protocols at the southern U.S. border, according to Brigham and Women’s Hospital spokesperson Mark Murphy.
“Michael VanRooyen, MD, MPH is an emergency physician and humanitarian expert with many years of experience in managing health programs in complex humanitarian crises around the world,” Murphy wrote in an emailed statement. “He is consulting with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to enable the children arriving at the border to receive necessary medical services.”
VanRooyen, a Medical School professor, also serves as the director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, a research center that works to understand humanitarian issues as part of global health problems.
The contract was first awarded to the “President and Fellows of Harvard College,” the official title of Harvard University. That allocation, however, was not intentional.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote that the contract was mistakenly awarded to the University in an email Tuesday.
“[T]he contract from CBP was initially awarded in error to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, likely due to the fact that VanRooyen has faculty appointments at both HMS and HSPH. However that error was corrected by CBP, as is documented in the Federal Procurement Database,” Swain wrote.
Customs and Border Patrol has faced criticism in recent months and weeks for reports of “serious” overcrowding, lack of access to showers and clean clothes, and an absence of hot meals over several days for children in detention facilities at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Employees at Wayfair, an online furnishing company based in Boston, recently protested its sale of more than $200,000 of bedroom furniture to a contractor that operates many of the border detention centers.
Sludge — an investigative reporting site — reported on numerous CBP contracts, including those with higher education institutions like Harvard and Columbia, by reviewing data from the Federal Procurement Data System.
Michael McCarthy, a CBP spokesperson, confirmed the error in an email Tuesday. He also noted that the money was instead given to Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
“BP entered into a contract with Harvard, but the contract was canceled,” McCarthy wrote. “Harvard wasn’t paid for any work.”
He added that CBP requires a medical professional consult on developing “mandatory guidelines” for CBP agents that detain individuals at the border. He said the protocols’ focus is to “facilitate identification” of children who are sick or injured and require additional assessment from other officials.
“CBP requires the experience of a medical professional who specializes in humanitarian and or pediatric medical triage techniques and processes to create and provide standardized medical screening protocols for assessing individuals apprehended while entering the United States illegally,” McCarthy wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wachusett Brewing Company will open a tab in Harvard Square this fall as it takes up residence at 33 Dunster St. — the former home of John Harvard’s Brewery & Ale House.
A beloved fixture in Harvard Square since 1992, John Harvard’s flagship succumbed in May to a string of closings in the area. Earlier this year, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Sweet Bakery, and Au Bon Pain closed their doors in Harvard Square. Qdoba Mexican Eats was the latest business to fall when it closed its Mass Ave. location last week.
Wachusett Brewing Company is a 25-year-old business that ranks as the second largest production brewery in Massachusetts and one of the top 50 craft brewers in the country, according to its website. Christian McMahan, the president of the Westminster-based company, said in an interview Tuesday that he hopes the new taproom becomes a new “staple” in Harvard Square.
McMahan said Wachusett Brewing Company plans to offer a set of beers exclusive to its Cambridge location in the 15-barrel, on-site brewhouse, where John Harvard’s used to brew small batches of beer until 2016.
“We have a very diversified portfolio ourselves, from beers people know — like Wachusett Blueberry — to our series of New England IPAs to ciders,” McMahan said.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said Tuesday despite the “sad” loss of an “iconic” restaurant like John Harvard’s, she looks forward to welcoming Wachusett.
“What will separate them from John Harvard’s in a really exciting way is that they are actually going to be brewing in the location again,” Jillson said.
McMahan said the company looked at over two dozen locations for its newest brewery, but ultimately chose Cambridge for the “diversity” the area offers. He said he is confident the taproom will bring “energy” to the space, as there will also be food, live music, and games for patrons.
“Beer makes its own friends across demographics, genders, ethnicities, ages,” McMahan said.
By December, the Harvard Square location will be the third permanent fixture of Wachusett Brewing Company, McMahan said. Its other locations are in Westminster and Worcester, Mass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Qdoba Mexican Eats took its burritos out of Harvard Square last week when it closed its location on Massachusetts Avenue.
The national chain had been competing with Harvard Square’s other Mexican restaurants since 2007, but contractors took down the brand’s signage on its former 1280 Mass. Ave. location on Monday.
Denise A. Jillson, the head of the Harvard Square Business Association, said Monday that the “Qdoba corner” has not been “alive and active” in a long time. She said the chain faced competition from rival Mexican restaurants that affected its viability as a restaurant in the area.
“It doesn't surprise us that they're closing,” Jillson said. “People have found other places in the Square where they prefer the food, like the Border Cafe or El Jefe’s or Felipe’s.”
Qdoba is the latest in a wave of Harvard Square businesses to close their doors, following the closing of Starbucks in Harvard Square’s Garage, Au Bon Pain, and fellow Mexican chain eatery Chipotle earlier this year.
Qdoba announced it would open its Mass. Ave. corner location in November 2006 after waiting three years to serve its burritos in Harvard Square. In its early years, Qdoba hosted the popular Rice and Bean Pot Burrito Eating Contest, during which Harvard students competed against their peers at other Boston area schools to win a trip to a Mexican or Caribbean destination of their choice.
Christian D. Wood ’11 — a member of the winning team — said Tuesday that the group never ended up taking their trip, but he was still glad to trade in the weeklong vacation for “eternal glory” after training extensively at the restaurant.
Ryan K. Burke ’10, another member of the winning team, said Tuesday he had a “vivid flashback” to a crowd cheering loudly in the restaurant during the final round of the competition. Burke added that he thought Qdoba’s burritos distinguished themselves from the others in Harvard Square by their sizable width.
During the University’s historic dining hall workers’ strike in 2016, Qdoba was among the restaurants where students reported spending the money Harvard added to their Crimson Cash accounts, a payment system used to purchase food in on and off-campus establishments. Over the course of the strike, Harvard added a total of $75 to undergraduate Crimson Cash accounts to provide students with more flexible food options.
Since then, however, students said the restaurant’s popularity has waned.
Buddy K. Scott ’22, who said he "never even" went to Qdoba, said he believes the restaurant was not a “popular option” for food in Harvard Square.
Jennifer S. Zhu ’22 said she thinks other Mexican restaurants in the area offered “much better” food options than Qdoba.
Jillson said that though she does not know which business will move into Qdoba’s now vacant corner, she nevertheless looks forward to welcoming a new occupant to the square — one that will hopefully offer an “additive” experience for locals and visitors.
“With the closing of Qdoba, it’s difficult to admit, but I think the impact will actually be positive,” Jillson said.
Qdoba’s district manager Jose A. Arroyo declined to comment for this story.
