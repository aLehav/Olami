After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the infamous Citizens United v. FEC decision, the system of virtually unlimited campaign donations and multi-billion-dollar election cycles that it enshrined has faced a growing backlash. Campaign finance reform, however, has never been a bread-and-butter issue. But today, as anti-establishment candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders, Harvard’s own Lawrence Lessig, and Donald Trump continue to captivate the American public and dominate news headlines, campaign finance reform has emerged as a central topic in the upcoming presidential election. These candidates, however outrageous, recognize that the current political system is deeply corrupt—even if Trump seems proud of his role in that corruption. This rare shift in the mainstream political dialogue to a pressing, substantive issue of our time is a glimmer of hope for the future in the political circus that is the 2016 presidential election.
Sanders made campaign finance reform the heart of his presidential campaign from the start. Recently, he has described the status quo as “legalized bribery”, and he has vowed to introduce legislation for the public funding of elections. These are important ideas, though Sanders remains roughly 24 points behind Hilary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination,
Sanders calls it as it is, and has run on a genuine platform of political reform.
Lawrence Lessig, Sanders’s Democratic opponent and perhaps the country’s most ardent supporter of campaign finance reform, is quite a different animal; some commentators have even described him as a sort of Trump of the left. Though campaign finance reform is a cornerstone issue of Sanders’s campaign, it is essentially the only issue in Lessig’s. His plan, if elected, to resign the presidency immediately after the passage of a campaign finance reform bill he calls the “Citizens Equality Act of 2017” is bold, unprecedented, and unlikely to happen. But it has got people talking, and that conversation is doing far more good than it can ever do harm.
But the candidate who has essentially dominated media attention this summer is of course businessman Donald Trump. When Trump is not making racist, insulting, and unsubstantiated claims about Mexican immigrants or bizarre, pseudo-statistical claims about the economy, his callousness may actually be a force for good. Lessig has praised Trump for his honest dissection of the political system. Trump the mogul openly gave money to candidates across the political spectrum, including many of his current Republican and Democratic opponents. But rather than repudiate these donations, in the first Republican debate, Trump bluntly stated: “When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. And that’s a broken system.” Trump ought not to be championed as a reformer. His plans for changing the broken system he has correctly exposed amount to the empty claim that he will simply fix it. Trump may genuinely not understand this, but no candidate without a plan, bi-partisan support, or, at the very least, a modicum of political experience, can fix Washington.
This election season, the populists have brought the issue of campaign finance reform out of a position of relative obscurity and into the political limelight. Though Sanders, Lessig and Trump are unlikely to capture their respective parties’ nominations, they have ushered in a welcome change in the discourse. Mainstream candidates like Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and others whose campaigns are funded primarily through political action committees and Super PACs, have largely ignored the issue, and instead represent the heart of the corrupt system. We hope the outsider trio’s frankness about campaign finance reform will make the issue a permanent, dominant topic of discussion until the day reform finally comes.

In its first iteration last semester, Ethical Reasoning 38: “The Meaning of Life” drew 116 students and almost certainly more for shopping week. Not everyone enrolled hoping to discover the meaning of life, but I do believe the class size reflects the existential angst many college students struggle with. Although the widespread presence of  anxiety comes at no surprise, what I did find surprising during my experience in the class is that although everyone seemed to believe that objective meaning doesn’t exist and that what makes a life meaningful is an entirely personal question, nobody felt comfortable answering it. Instead, students continually argued that no definition of a meaningful life is inherently more valid than another. I believe the appeal of this relativist framework and our hesitation to define even personal standards for life’s meaning stem from a fear of the responsibility that comes with defining a standard for life’s meaning. Only by overcoming this fear of responsibility can we put ourselves on paths towards more fulfilling lives.
We must recognize that even as relativism forces us to accept that no view of life’s meaning is inherently more legitimate than any other, relativism doesn’t preclude us from exploring our own personal views. For example, when it comes to morality, although relativists might recognize that even murder isn’t objectively bad, relativists can be personally convinced that murder is bad. Nonetheless, when it comes to arguments about life’s meaning, we find ourselves incapable of defining standards of life’s meaning that are personally convincing. We instead repeat that no argument is inherently truer than any other.
Obviously life’s meaning is a difficult question, but I believe a deeper-seated fear of responsibility prevents us from even defining a personally convincing standard. If we accept a standard for life’s meaning, we would be forced to look inward and question how our own lives compare to that standard—a terrifying prospect. During our introspection, we might conclude that we could be living more meaningful lives. This conclusion would mean accepting both the responsibility to live a more meaningful life and the possibility that we might fail to do so. Once we accept that our lives should be lived in a certain way, the stakes become frighteningly high. Thus, rather than accepting meaning and the responsibility that comes with it, we repeatedly argue that meaning is an entirely personal question, but don’t answer it.
I believe this fear of responsibility and failure is particularly present in us, Harvard students, because once we define life’s meaning either objectively or subjectively, we would be forced to recognize that we have been blessed (or cursed) with the talent and the opportunity to pursue the very life that we have defined as meaningful. Once we accept that we can live meaningful lives, we have only our lack of effort to blame for not doing so.
By recognizing our true insecurities, we can put ourselves on the right path. Once we overcome this fear of responsibility and failure, and are instead honest with ourselves about what we believe makes a life meaningful, we can take advantage of our talents and the unique opportunities this university provides us with to pursue lives we find fulfilling. Overcoming our insecurities and defining what we believe to be life’s meaning is certainly a difficult process that takes time. As such, we must begin this process now, with our lives ahead of us. If we delay, the life we ultimately find meaningful and fulfilling may be out of reach, or worse, have passed us by.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last February, during one of the snowiest winters in Boston history, I watched the first episode of Game of Thrones: “Winter is Coming.”The title of that episode is a consistent refrain throughout the show, forecasting a long, cold winter and suggesting that those who are wise should prepare.
Most scientists contend extreme weather like what we saw in New England last winter is exacerbated by climate change. The atmosphere is able to hold more moisture when sea surfaces are warmer. In this way, global warming leads to a greater likelihood of harsher and more frequent storms.
This past summer, I was invited by Business Forward to join senior Obama Administration officials and business leaders from across the nation at the White House to discuss efforts businesses are taking to become more sustainable and reduce carbon pollution. The discussion was encouraging, as it emphasized that climate change is not a far off problem that will affect our grandchildren. It is hurting our economy now.
Snowfall cost Massachusetts $265 million each day last winter. Hourly wage workers and locally-owned small businesses were hit hardest.
For example, the historic winter forced Grendel’s Den in Harvard Square to pay thousands in snow removal costs and increased overhead since the restaurant’s owners refused to cut back employee hours. With already slim margins, the restaurant had to operate at a loss, according to emails sent to the author from the owner of Grendel's Den.
Irving House, a bed and breakfast here in Cambridge, saw losses as travelers cancelled trips and MBTA outages left employees stranded at the inn, according to emails sent to the author from the owner of Irving House.
Along with reduced revenue from extreme weather, businesses and universities lose big by operating inefficient buildings. Using more energy efficient building materials, upgrading insulation and installing controls on energy use saves companies millions. In Cambridge, buildings are estimated to generate over 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the city. Investments in energy efficient facilities now will not only save money, but could also lessen the blow of future storms.
Business owners and consumers are increasingly realizing there are other sustainable practices they can engage in to combat the rise in global temperatures and its negative impact on economic output.
Businesses like Grendel's Den and Irving House are examples of great companies not just hoping to weather the storm, but also doing their part to help combat climate change. Grendel’s now has a zero trash policy—they recycle and compost everything. Irving House is a recognized business leader by the Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts. All of Harvard’s undergraduate dining halls are certified by the Green Restaurant Association. Imagine if more businesses and institutions operated this way. The impact would be enormous.
That’s where consumers come in.
More and more, people are choosing to support sustainable businesses. As we do, we provide a financial incentive for other businesses to follow suit. Consumers are in total control of the demand side of the supply and demand proposition—the more we show a demand for products and services made in an eco-friendly manner, the more businesses will supply them.
If we make common-sense choices as business leaders and support businesses and organizations doing good for the planet as consumers, we are less likely to endure harsh winters in the future.
Winter is coming. And the economic impact of climate change is already here. Now is the time to act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Responding to student suggestions and internal review, the Bureau of Study Counsel has increased peer tutor wages and decreased tutoring fees for this academic year.
On-call tutors, who assist students in particular subject areas, will now receive $18 per hour, a raise from last year’s wage of $14 per hour. Award peer tutors, who meet with BSC administrators on a weekly basis in addition to their work tutoring students, will now earn $20 per hour, compared to $16 per hour last year.
The rate charged to tutees will also change this fall, according to BSC Associate Director Sheila M. Reindl. That rate—formerly $7 per hour for the first 10 hours of peer tutoring per course per semester and $14 per hour for tutoring beyond the 10 hours —now will be $7 per hour “with no limit on the number of hours per course or per term,” Reindl wrote in an email.
While the flat rate for tutees will make using the BSC more affordable, the tutor wage raise came in response to a shortage of tutors, Reindl wrote.
“[T]he demand for tutors exceeded supply in several courses and there was a question of whether a higher rate of pay would yield more tutors and greater tutor availability,” Reindl wrote.
Award peer tutors, also raised concerns about the lack of tutors at their weekly meetings with BSC officials, particularly in large General Education classes, former tutor Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said. BSC officials often asked for advice on how to attract more tutors, according to award peer tutor Ahmee K. Marshall-Christensen ’16.
Award peer tutors brainstormed solutions, including departmental-based tutor recruitment, in-person pitches to join the tutoring program, and personalized emails, but those efforts did not fill the demand for tutors, Goffard said.
Marshall-Christensen said peer tutors during discussions cited comparable or less demanding jobs on campus that offered more money, a factor that attracted applicants to those positions. In contrast, he said peer tutors merit higher wages because of how demanding tutoring is.
“You have to be totally present when you’re talking to somebody,” he said.
The peer tutors suggested that the BSC raise tutor wages accordingly.
“By and large, the number one suggestion we had was to increase student wages,” Goffard said. “We thought, at the end of the day, an increase in the tutor wage would definitely be the most effective way to get a sustainable supply of tutors.”
The tutors also plan to make recruitment pitches in several upper-level classes during the first weeks of the semester, said Rebekka E. Depew ’16, another BSC tutor.

Roughly 1 percent of certificates granted by Harvard’s and MIT’s school-specific edX platforms were earned by users engaging in a form of cheating never before possible in traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms, according to a working paper released by researchers from the two schools.
The paper—authored by MIT Ph.D. candidate Curtis G. Northcutt, MIT professor Isaac L. Chuang, and HarvardX research committee co-chair Andrew D. Ho—studied a previously unexamined form of cheating known as "copying answers using multiple existences online," or CAMEO.
Users engaging in CAMEO register for a given course with multiple accounts, one of which is designated the “master” account. They then use non-master “harvester” accounts to click through assessments as quickly as possible until the grading tool provides correct answers. The CAMEO user then inputs these “harvested” answers to gain certification for their “master” account in a significantly shorter amount of time than is generally possible.
“The strange thing is this is a kind of cheating you can’t normally have on campus,” Chuang said. “The uniqueness of this was really quite interesting and startling.”
An algorithm that cross-checked IP addresses with time-stamps of answer submissions found that 1,237 certificates across 69 HarvardX and MITx courses were obtained using CAMEO, amounting to 1.3 percent of certificates granted in those courses.
The study found that the CAMEO prevalence was greatest in the social sciences, government, and health categories, where 1.3 percent of the certificate issued were obtained by cheating, and lowest in the computer science category, where only 0.1 percent of the certificates were associated with CAMEO use.
Chaung attributed the disciplinary disparity to the differences between assessments in humanities and engineering courses.
“Randomized questions are easier to ask when you have numeric answers,” Chuang said. “It’s more difficult to ask different questions in humanities and social science scenarios.”
The study also found that CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international.
“The between country or between group differences might have a lot to do with the perceived value of the [course completion] certificate,” Ho said, emphasizing the need for further research to conclusively establish the causes of the disparities.
According to the paper, the researchers’ detection algorithm was designed “with highly conservative cutoffs intended to reduce false positives,” and Chuang and Ho said that the algorithm may have missed CAMEO users who space out their answer input over a longer period of time or make use of IP anonymizers.
They also acknowledged that CAMEO use may become more refined as detection methods become more prevalent.
“In many ways, it can be an arms race,” Chuang said. “For any detection mechanism we create, we suspect that there will be gradually more sophistication [amongst CAMEO users], but, you know, the idea is not to go there if at all possible.”
The study also includes suggestions for course designers of ways to avoid CAMEO, including withholding answers until after an assignment is due and writing questions with randomizable elements so that each user receives a different version of the question, but Ho and Chuang said that these changes could entail significant pedagogical trade-offs for instructors.
The publication of the study, which points out that CAMEO is in violation of edX’s honor code, coincided with the rollout of Harvard College's own honor code and ongoing conversations about academic integrity at the University.
In response to the study, HarvardX administrators wrote in a statement that “HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.”
HarvardX spokesperson Michael P. Rutter declined to provide further details on how CAMEO cases might be adjudicated or how certificates, all of which are distributed electronically and many of which do not bear the legal name of the recipient, would be revoked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid contract negotiations with representatives from the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, Harvard’s director of labor relations, Bill Murphy, left the University in early August to assume a similar position at Northeastern.
Since the spring, University and HUCTW representatives have been negotiating a new contract for union employees. According to Jaeger, the two parties met over the summer in semi-weekly sessions dealing with issues related to employee benefits like health care, alternative work arrangements, and work flexibility. 
With the union’s current labor contract set to expire on Sept. 30, HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said it came as a “surprise” that Murphy chose to depart two months prior to the negotiations’ ultimate deadline.
“We all certainly expected in the lead up to the current negotiations that he’d be leading the University’s participation in that,” Jaeger said. “It certainly is a bump in the road in our negotiations that has caused us to have to recalibrate.”
Work still remains in coming to an agreement before the contract expires at the end of the month, according to Jaeger. “We’d like to be further along than we are right now,” he said.
Susannah “Polly” Scannell ’80—who has served as the deputy director under Murphy since 2006 and joined the Office of Labor and Employee Relations in 2000—succeeded Murphy on an interim basis following his exit. Scannell declined to comment for this article.
Even with the turnover, Jaeger indicated that he hopes the negotiations will go on without delay, given that Scannell has played a central role in contract discussions over the last several years.
“Scannell is somebody who has been part of formulating the University’s approach. It’s not likely to be a striking change,” he said.
In a brief phone interview, Murphy downplayed his departure and its potential impact on the University’s negotiations with the union. Harvard works with multiple labor unions, he said, and is often involved in ongoing labor contract negotiations.
Last month, University administrators detailed more changes to health insurance options for Harvard’s nonunion faculty and staff members, following a year of faculty criticism and pushback after officials rolled out a new benefits plan last fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard moves into the new academic year, it faces mounting scrutiny into an aspect of its admission process that administrators have long held is central to fostering diversity in its student body—race-based affirmative action.
Last academic year alone, Harvard was hit with a string of allegations accusing the College of discriminating based on race because it, like many other colleges and universities, considers race among other factors in its admissions decisions. 
Last November, an anti-affirmation group filed a lawsuit against Harvard, alleging that its admissions policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants. This past spring, more than 60 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the federal Departments of Education and Justice making similar charges, calling for an in-depth investigation into Harvard’s use of race in its admissions processes.
That complaint was dismissed by the Department of Education because of its similarities to the separate and ongoing lawsuit against Harvard.
But outside Harvard, affirmative action is also under fire: The U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to re-hear another affirmative case in higher education—Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin, which involves a white woman who claims she was unjustly denied admission to the school because of her race. The man behind that case, Edward Blum, is the same person who organized the lawsuit challenging Harvard’s affirmative action policies.
These high-profile challenges to affirmative action threaten what administrators say is one of Harvard’s methods to achieving campus diversity, which the University publicly values; its official admissions website declares that “While Harvard is renowned for its academic excellence, we strongly believe that one of our greatest strengths is the exceptional diversity within the student body.”
University President Drew G. Faust, meanwhile, addressed the Blum lawsuit against Harvard on Wednesday in remarks in Memorial Church, vowing to defend Harvard’s policies against what she described as a challenge to the University’s “fundamental values.”
Experts say the University has a lot at stake in the ongoing litigation, both in the Fisher case and the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard.
“What Harvard stands to lose...is the most efficient and direct route to achieving racial diversity,” said Tomiko Brown-Nagin, a professor at Harvard Law School and expert in education law and policy. Other methods universities can use to foster campus diversity, such as ramping up recruiting efforts to high schools with many minority applicants, are much less time- and cost-effective, she said.
“Harvard and all of the other colleges that have legal action pending are going to be subject to the Supreme Court case,” said David A. Hawkins, the executive director for educational content and policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling, of which Harvard is a member.
Lawyers representing Harvard filed a motion this summer to delay the pending lawsuit against Harvard until the Supreme Court reviews the Fisher case, as the two deal “with the same fundamental issues,” according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal.
According to Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia, a ruling against race-based affirmative action would cause an “ongoing nightmare” for Harvard, as it would open floodgates for other rejected students seeking compensation.
“The lawyers at Harvard will be busy for a very long time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As hundreds of students streamed into Sanders Theatre for the highly publicized first lecture of Computer Science 50, Harvard’s introductory computer science course, posters parodying the hype surrounding the popular class popped up around the College’s campus on Wednesday.
The series of posters, hung up in locations including the Quincy House Grille and the entrance to Leverett House’s courtyard, seemed to be a play on materials and merchandise used to promote the actual course. Signed with the tagline, “#notCS50,” the posters feature white typeface on colored backgrounds. One declared, “I did not take CS50,” an apparent reference to real course T-shirts that say “I took CS50.”
In addition, a Facebook profile called “Dave Melon,” seemingly a parody of the name of CS50’s high-profile instructor, computer science professor of the practice David J. Malan ’99, also appeared and “friended” some College students. Its profile picture also has the “#notCS50” tagline.
There also is a “Notcs50” Facebook page; the “Dave Melon” account shared several posts from that page, many criticizing the real course. “Students on Harvard's campus are taking CS50 because of the cult-like pressure around them. We aim to help people truly make a choice for themselves,” one post said.
A Tumblr blog, also titled “#notCS50,” purports that the posters and social media activity are a concerted effort to challenge the popular course, which has attracted hundreds of students in recent years, boasts corporate sponsors, and has managed to keep Widener Library open later in the evenings and circumvent the Administrative Board, which was until recently the College’s primary disciplinary body. It has even spread to Yale.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the posters and social media accounts on Wednesday. But the blog’s mission statement indicated that those behind them hope to highlight what it described as the “unprecedented celebrity and status” surrounding the course.
“#NotCS50 is a movement designed to remind students that just because there is huge university and corporate backing of CS50, an introductory college course like any other, that doesn’t mean they have to take it,” according to the Tumblr.
By Wednesday evening, posts that purported to be testimonials from several students, identified by only their class years and concentrations, had appeared on the tumblr. An anonymous person described as a senior philosophy student, for example, wrote a 36-line poem about being a humanities concentrator who has recognized the “cult” of CS50, according to the post.
“They could not find silence. / Shopping week, / and ‘I took CS50,’ / ‘take CS50,’ / echoed in my dreams,’” the poem says.
Malan, for his part, responded to the parodies in an email, writing that his course is one of many that provide College students with a liberal arts education.
“Quite a few students take CS50 each year, and quite a few do not, and that's certainly what we'd expect on a campus with so many interests and so many courses,” Malan wrote. “[F]or many students, CS50 is a terminal course, whereby it's their only academic exposure to computer science. As such, I do think it (and any number of other gateway courses) is absolutely a candidate part of a liberal arts education.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Superior Court judge in Waterbury, Conn., has ruled that the national fraternity organization Sigma Phi Epsilon must proceed to trial as a defendant following the 2011 Harvard-Yale tailgate incident that left one woman dead and two others injured.
In November 2011 at the Harvard-Yale football game in New Haven, Brandon Ross, a member of Yale's chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, lost control of a U-Haul truck containing alcohol and other items en route to a fraternity-sanctioned tailgate, careening into a crowd of people.
Ross struck and killed Nancy Barry, 30, a resident of Salem, Mass., and injured Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach and Yale student Sarah Short.
In 2012, Short filed a lawsuit against Ross and the national fraternity. The lawsuit also named U-Haul and Yale as defendants, but the claim was later withdrawn. This past March, the national organization submitted a motion for summary judgment, which would allow the suit to bypass a full trial by jury and be directly decided by a judge.
But in her order released last month, Judge Kari Anne Dooley wrote that the evidence presented offered conflicting conclusions on the relationship between the national organization and the local chapter. The absence of a conclusive fact, she wrote, indicates that a jury must decide.
“There is no one conclusive determination that must be drawn from the evidence as to whether an agency relationship exists between the local chapter and the National organization,” Dooley wrote. “This will be for the jury to decide.”
Faxon Law Group partner Eric P. Smith, who represents Short and filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion, welcomed the order in a press release.
“The court’s ruling ensures the case against the national fraternity will go before a jury where we will present evidence establishing why the national fraternity is fully responsible under the law for Ross’ negligent actions,” Smith said in the release.
Since the 2011 incident, the national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization has distanced itself from the actions of the local Yale chapter.
In an October 2013 deposition provided to The Crimson by Faxon Law Group, Brian C. Warren, Jr., the chief executive officer of the national organization, said  the local chapters are self-governing when it comes to enforcing national expectations.
“We, unfortunately, take action when we are made aware of something,” Warren said. “We are just not in a position to know—or be the first to know because we don’t have direct involvement in the chapter operation.”
Also in the deposition, Kathy Johnston, the director of risk management for the national organization, said Yale’s local chapter violated national policy by transporting alcohol, and therefore may not be eligible for the national fraternity’s insurance.
“[Ross] was transporting alcohol in a bulk quantity, so that would call into question whether or not he was acting within the scope of his duties for the fraternity,” Johnston said. “He was violating the risk management policy.”
The national organization did not return a request for comment.
In addition to the lawsuit against the national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization, Short filed a separate lawsuit against the members of the local chapter. The 86 individuals have motioned for a summary judgment and are awaiting a decision from a judge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard faces a lawsuit alleging discrimination in the College’s admissions practices, University President Drew G. Faust upheld Harvard’s commitment to diversity on Wednesday and pledged “our vigorous defense of our procedures.”
Before a crowd of about 40 people at Memorial Church’s morning prayers, Faust spoke softly but firmly about an issue that could fundamentally change the way the College constructs its classes. 
“As the 2015-16 academic year begins, Harvard confronts a lawsuit that touches on its most fundamental values, a suit that challenges our admissions processes and our commitment to a widely diverse student body,” Faust said. “Our vigorous defense of our procedures and of the kind of educational experience they are intended to create will cause us to speak frequently and forcefully about the importance of diversity in the months to come.”
Last year, the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions sued Harvard, charging that it employs “racially and ethnically discriminatory policies” in its College admissions procedures. Six months later, more than 60 Asian-American groups also filed a complaint against Harvard with the Departments of Education and Justice on similar grounds. The Education Department has since  dismissed that complaint.
As part of her governing ideology, Faust has often sought to address even public issues behind the scenes instead of through the bully pulpit, but on Wednesday she did not shy away from issuing a charge of sorts to University affiliates.
“The University is an institution committed to free speech—yours and everyone else’s,” Faust said. “In the course of the year to come, that freedom is likely to produce some utterances that we deplore. And there will be times we must speak out against them.”
Lawyers for Harvard, who have consistently defended Harvard’s admissions policies, filed a motion this summer asking for a delay in the ongoing lawsuit until the U.S. Supreme Court hears again the case Fisher v.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's days into the College's rollout of its first honor code, but many professors did not mention the policy in their course syllabi or during opening lectures on Wednesday, although some referenced the new document in introducing their courses to students. 
The syllabus for French Aa: “Beginning French I,” for example, describes the honor code as a document that strengthens the academic integrity at the College and tells students that course instructors “will ask you to confirm your commitment to the Honor [Code] through an ‘Affirmation of Integrity’ on various assignments."
Paul Bamberg, a senior Mathematics lecturer, also touched on academic integrity in his course, Math 116: “Real Analysis, Convexity, and Optimization.”
“This is an issue about which I’ve worried quite a bit,” Bamberg said, adding that he has a special policy for his students about citing sources on exams. Building off Community Conversations he had with freshmen during their orientation week, he plans to lead a discussion about academic honesty on Thursday in Science Center A.
Other professors, however, chose to focus their lectures on Wednesday on course material and assignments rather than the College’s new academic integrity policy. Even Brett Flehinger—the secretary of the Honor Council, the new student-faculty body tasked with hearing cheating cases—did not explicitly mention the honor code in his opening lecture Wednesday.
Still, Flehinger, who is co-teaching teaching History 1063: “America and Vietnam: 1945-1975,” said the course will reference the policy later on, incorporating the principles behind the honor code through discussions about historians’ methodologies, assignments that require students to use a variety of sources, and conversations about how to take tests with honesty.
“We want honesty, accuracy, and effective use of sources to go together and we build this into the work throughout the semester,” Flehinger wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tale of two halves for the Harvard women’s soccer team on Wednesday night.
A dominant second half by the Crimson proved not to be enough as the team fell to Boston College, 2-1, in the team’s home opener at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium. Harvard outshout the Eagles 13-2 in the game’s final 45 minutes but could not overcome two separate one-goal deficits.
The Crimson (1-1-0) was looking to beat BC (4-1-0), one of three Power Five conference opponents on its schedule, for the first time since 2001.
Harvard is 4-2-3 all-time in home openers under coach Ray Leone. The team’s 17 total shots were the most the Crimson has had in a game since registering 24 against Brown last season.
“They’re an ACC team which means we know they’re super high-quality,” junior forward Joan Fleischman said. “It’s a great Boston rivalry and it’s fun to challenge ourselves like that. We haven’t beaten them, but we’re getting closer every year.”
From the start of the second half, Harvard dominated possession and the game’s pace. The Crimson utilized its depth and the play from its midfielders to keep the pressure on the Eagles and keep the ball out of its defensive zone.
After the first half saw both teams register only four shots apiece, Harvard was able to take control in the BC zone and pick up a second half goal for the second consecutive game.
“We really look forward to these games to get us fit, get us ready to play well at our highest level that we can come Ivy,” Washburn said.
Junior forward Midge Purce spearheaded a shift in momentum in the Crimson offense’s direction. The reigning first team All-Ivy pick left a drop pass for forward Rachel Garcia, but the Eagle defense was able to deflect the junior transfer’s shot away from the net. A free kick five minutes later sailed just above the BC net and Purce’s collision with BC senior goalkeeper Alex Johnson garnered two more scoring chances.
“We didn’t make any big changes,” Fleischman said. “I think it was more of a change in mentality, believing that we could win and having the play change with that.”
Down 1-0 to start the second half following a goal by Eagles junior midfielder Lauren Berman in the 30th minute, Harvard took seven shots, three by Purce, before Fleischman found the back of the net in the 68th minute on captain Haley Washburn’s free kick.
“Haley hit a perfect ball in and it was volleying around,” Fleischman said. “I just ran through it. [Calise] was telling me at halftime, if we’re running at the keeper, she’s not great off her line. If we had people running at her, we’re going to finish it.”
Purce began attracting more attention from BC defenders as the half wore on, but the Crimson was unable to register more than one goal. Johnson stopped five of the six Harvard shots on goal to keep the Eagles in the game.
Less than two minutes after conceding their lead, BC jumped ahead for good after a turnover in the Crimson defensive zone. Junior forward Hayley Dowd corraled the loose ball and buried a shot past junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack.
It was one of the few mistakes that the Harvard defense made all night and the Eagles’ only real scoring chance of the second half.
“I thought our defense was a lot better,” Washburn said. “With time, naturally we’re going to get better. I just think that we’re finding more of a rhythm as a team.”
Dowd’s goal shifted the momentum in BC’s direction for the remainder of the game. While the Crimson controlled the ball for most of the game’s final 20 minutes, it generated only two shots on goal and no real scoring chances.
Leone had 15 different players log at least 10 minutes of action, but no combination could produce a second equalizer.
“We have a lot of depth on our team,” Washburn said. “We have a ton of good players and people are battling for positions right now. We’re working together, it’s been really, really good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Max Everson will begin his professional career not too far afield from the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The Boston Bruins acquired the negotiation rights for the former Harvard men’s hockey co-captain on Monday and expect him to sign an entry-level deal with their American Hockey League affiliate in Providence in the coming days.
“I want to play a lot of games at the highest level possible,” Everson said Wednesday. “I’m looking to be a consistent player and have a significant positive impact on each game.”
Everson was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2011 before recording 17 points and 58 penalty minutes over 101 career games with Harvard. He captained the Crimson to the 2015 ECAC Hockey conference tournament title in his senior season alongside junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo.
“He was a great leader in the locker room,” Criscuolo said. “He talked when he had to, but the way he carried himself—guys just tried to follow him and emulate the way he worked every day.”
The pending deal will formally end a long period of uncertainty regarding Everson’s career.
In 2012, Everson withdrew from the College in the midst of his sophomore season alongside defenseman Patrick McNally and goaltender Steve Michalek during the Government 1310 cheating investigation.
After the NCAA denied a request in June to restore the three players’ lost season of eligibility, McNally and Michalek signed contracts with the San Jose Sharks and the Minnesota Wild, respectively, while Everson pursued an appeal. By the time Everson received the final word from the NCAA in late July, the Maple Leafs’ AHL affiliate did not have a defensive roster spot left for Everson.
“[My agent and I] kind of scrambled at that point,” Everson said. “We started talking with some guys and the Providence deal came to fruition, so I’m very happy with that.”
According to Everson, the Maple Leafs received “future considerations” in return, essentially gifting him to Providence.
“My agent got in touch with Toronto to see if they’d move me for pretty much nothing in return,” Everson said. “I was very glad that Toronto was willing to do that, and I got a good call from them.”
Everson has two half-courses left toward his Harvard degree and expects to graduate next summer. He will now focus on preparing for the Boston’s rookie camp, which will run from Sept. 10 through Sept. 16 .
With Providence’s six regular skaters on defense returning this year, competition will be tight for Everson to crack the team’s opening night roster on Oct. 9. Should he not make Providence’s roster at the beginning of the year, he will play his first professional minutes with the ECHL’s Gwinnet Gladiators of Duluth, Ga.
“The game is going to be faster and guys are going to be stronger, so I’m just trying to be prepared the best I can right away and hit the ground running,” Everson said.
The Harvard men’s hockey team will vote on captains later this month. With the departure of Everson, McNally, and Michalek to the pros, the Crimson will enter the 2015-2016 season with a young defensive core.
Everson feels his former teammates will rise to the challenge of increased ice time and game responsibility.
“There’s going to be some battles [for ice time] for sure,” Everson said. “There are a lot of guys who have played minutes and a lot of guys who are good hockey players. There’s opportunity—whether it’s young guys or guys who have been here a bit…. If they can show up and have a good fall and start off well early, some guys will have opportunities to make big steps this year.”
Similarly, Criscuolo looks forward to following Everson’s progress down Interstate 95.
“I think he’ll do extremely well,” Criscuolo said. “He’s a fast kid, and he’s really strong for the way that he plays, particularly in his own end.”
