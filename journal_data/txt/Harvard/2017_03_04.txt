After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I’m tired of conducting services in praise and worship of a senile delinquent!” proclaims Reverend Shannon in Act II of Williams’s 1948 play “The Night of the Iguana.” Given a work where such stark, cutting statements clash with offbeat, often hilarious characters—including a “splendidly physical” family of Nazi tourists, a furious lesbian vocal teacher, two Mexican boys, and a wheelchair-bound poet “ninety-seven years young”—putting on a successful production seems like a daunting task. Yet the American Repertory Theater’s adaptation at the Loeb Drama Center on Feb. 24 successfully found both the comedy and tragedy in Williams’s existential despair, doing justice to a titan of the theatrical canon.
The play centers on the disgraced Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon (Bill Heck), who comes to stay at a hotel at the edge of the Mexican jungle. Shannon begins the play with a history of rebellion and insanity: He has been locked out of his own church for fornication and heresy, taking a job as a travel agent instead. While catching up with his recently widowed friend Maxine Faulk (Dana Delany), who owns the hotel, he attempts to manage his impatient tour group and avoid a young girl he has been accused of raping. In the midst of all this, the broke painter Hannah Jelkes (Amanda Plummer, known for her roles in “Pulp Fiction” and “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”) and her poet grandfather Nonno (James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader and “The Lion King”’s Mufasa) arrive at the hotel’s doorstep in need of a room, and the bond forged between Shannon and Hannah quickly becomes the centerpiece of the play and the source of its greatest revelations.
A production of this sort of play, in which relationships and dialogue take center stage, lives or dies with the actors. The American Repertory Theater’s actors are first-rate, and it shows. At first, the actors felt almost too disconnected from each other, with Delany’s modern wit clashing with Heck’s Southern drawl. But as the play crept on, the performances found their natural rhythm, culminating in a masterful scene in which Shannon and Hannah discuss their inner demons and the nature of love, death, and life. Heck and Plummer were by turns dominating and apologetic, stubborn and repentant. Seeing the dynamic shift between them was riveting. Jones’s performance is similarly powerful, with his offstage poetic musings lending a gravitas to the often comedic dialogue.
Still, the cast was able to bring out the lighter aspects of the play with Heck and Delany. Their conversations with other characters and with each other carried the perfect comedic timing to deliver Williams’s funniest lines, bringing laughter to the most unexpected scenes.
With such powerhouses as Heck and Plummer, the production team had the opportunity to create a powerful theatrical experience, and they took full advantage of it. The set design evoked both the dilapidation of a hotel in its off-season and the beauty of the Mexican coast, in stark contrast to the production’s powerful evocation of a thunderstorm (for Shannon, a symbol of God’s fury) that closed the first half of the play. The lighting design also portrayed the sun’s setting and rising particularly beautifully, with light filtered through silk curtains adding to an already picturesque set design. Director Michael Wilson constantly maintained several moving parts on stage, adding to the perfect chaos of the first act––his choice of having the Mexican boys, who help maintained the hotel under Maxine within the play, adjusted the set design and provided periodic offstage guitar music was particularly efficient and ingenious.
“Night of the Iguana” starts as a farce but ends in tragedy, and the American Repertory Theater’s production did justice to both aspects of the play. The actors and the production team combined their efforts to adhere to and uplift Williams’s masterpiece, giving full force to the play’s devastation but leaving some inkling of hope: As Hannah says, in times of loss and destruction, the key is simply “to keep on going.”
“The Night of the Iguana” is at the Loeb Drama Center from Mar. 3-18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—If Friday night’s game between the Harvard men’s basketball team and its counterpart from Princeton was supposed to be meaningless, somebody forgot to pass along the memo. Playing in front of a hostile crowd donning “All Stripes, One Streak” shirts and a larger audience watching on ESPNU, the Crimson had its heart broken by the Tigers again, this time, 73-69, at Jadwin Gymnasium.
The win pushed the Tigers’ win streak to 16 and added more fuel to a fire between two teams that appear to be on a collision course for next Sunday’s Ivy League Championship Game.Although the teams are locked into the top two seeds for the inaugural conference tournament next weekend, it was the third meeting in a row between the Crimson (18-8, 10-3 Ivy League) and Princeton (20-6, 13-0) that came down to the final seven seconds.
“You can’t say enough about how hard both teams played,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “All the kids were just tremendous on both squads. I’m proud of our kids for the effort that we displayed here tonight and obviously Princeton is very good. They’re undefeated in the league for a reason, they’re experienced, and [they’re] a very tough matchup all over the floor.”
For the second time this season, the result was hanging in the balance as the final minute wound down. With the game tied at 69 with just over a minute to play, Tigers senior forward Steven Cook, who had willed his team all night long, made one of his only mistakes of the evening. The Winnetka, Ill. native barreled into the lane, throwing up an errant layup and giving the Crimson a transition opportunity and a chance to finally take the lead after fighting tooth and nail to keep pace with a hot-shooting Princeton attack.
With chants of “airball” resounding from a raucous student section, freshman point guard Bryce Aiken drove through the Tiger defense but was called for a charge. The turnover, Aiken’s fifth of the evening, gave Princeton another shot to tilt the seesaw’s balance as the clock prepared to let out its final 48 ticks. After the Tigers took a timeout before running through their offense, senior forward Spencer Weisz bricked a long three.
Shades of four Saturdays prior came to mind as a long rebound landed in the arms of a Tiger big man, this time they belonged to sophomore guard Myles Stephens.
With the shot clock unplugged, Princeton coach Mitch Henderson implored his team to hold for the last shot. Despite Cook having the hot hand for most of the evening, junior guard Amir Bell stood with the ball at the top of the key as his teammates swarmed to the corners. Opposite the 6’4” guard was Harvard freshman forward Chris Lewis.
Bell waited until the clock read six. The East Brunswick, N.J. native used his off hand—his left one—to drive past Lewis, elevate, and bank in an off-balance layup with 1.1 seconds to play. The Crimson would get no closer.
“It was a hell of a play,” freshman wing Justin Bassey said. “Chris played great defense, but I think it was really good offense. We’d like to have it back, and a few plays here and there, but it was a really good play and there’s not much more we could’ve done.”
After a back-and-forth first 17 minutes, the Tigers began pulling away as Harvard fell into a characteristic cold spell before the break. Princeton ended the half on a 9-2 run as sophomore guard Devin Cannady drained a three in co-captain Siyani Chambers’ face to end the half. The Crimson was doomed by 12 first half turnovers during a half in which it only attempted 22 shots.

“I thought we were just sped up a little bit and trying to do too much, that’s been our biggest problem we’ve had all year,” Amaker said. “You can see it with our guards, we have to be able to take care of the ball much better than that.”
Coming out of a halftime performance that featured a woman catching bowls on her head while riding a unicycle, the Tigers tried to make a statement to start the second half, but Harvard had other plans. A failed throwdown from Stephens on an alley-oop gave the Crimson numbers on the other end. Freshman swingman Justin Bassey drilled a three and back-to-back triples from Chambers and freshman forward Seth Towns erased the nine-point halftime deficit.
Harvard rode Towns all evening. The Columbus, Ohio native was consistent and efficient on a night when the Crimson needed a steady hand on the offensive end. Aiken had the worst game of his college career, going 1-of-10 from the field, including an 0-for-7 mark from long range. He and Chambers combined for nine turnovers. Towns found his rhythm early in the first half and kept riding the wave.
“Honestly, my teammates just found me when I was open,” Towns said. “They have confidence in me to make shots and I certainly do so I was just doing what I could to get us a win. It didn’t turn out that way, but both teams were fighting.”
Harvard’s offense was about as one-dimensional as possible to start the game. The Crimson’s first 18 points came via three-pointers and the guests did not hit their first two-point field goal until there was 10:06 to play in the first half.
“We want to find the open man,” Amaker said. “I thought we were trying to share it and play inside out through Lewis and Zena and I thought that was very productive for us and the shots were there. I thought our guys did a tremendous job, particularly in the first half of making a lot of the threes.”
Towns hit two treys before the game’s first media timeout and entered the locker room at halftime with 14 points. Whether he was stroking jumpers over a zone or driving and throwing down a dunk like the one he flushed with 2:58 to play to tie the contest at 65, Towns could not be stopped. He finished the night with a career-high 26 points on 9-of-12 shooting. Princeton did not cool off much after intermission—making just one fewer field goal after the break—but the freshman was there to keep Harvard within striking distance.
For as good as Towns was on the offensive end, Cook was just a little bit better. The senior had four more points than Towns—which ended up being the difference in the game—and made 13 of his 16 shot attempts on a night when the Crimson was able to frustrate Cannady for the second game in a row.
Despite 61 of its 73 points coming from Cannady, Stephens, and Cook, it was the rebound by Stephens and the isolation dagger from Bell that proved to be the difference between the two teams—a difference Henderson described as “razor thin”—on Friday. Just in case the Ivy League Tournament needed another storyline, Friday provided it.
“I think that we have become [rivals] with a number of teams in our league with the success that these kids have had, which is a good thing,” Amaker said. “I think our league is really, really hard and challenging. Whether it’s us and Princeton or us and Yale or us and Penn or Penn and Princeton, there are a lot of darn good matchups in our conference that have become high-quality basketball games.”

Oh senior spring. That time when you can stop pretending to care about things. The woes of the world seem to melt away into the sun. Imagine a Mary Poppins meets Animal House cross over (seriously, Hollywood, make this movie). Carefree co-eds spend their time skipping around campus, laughing with each other, and generally devolving into slacker degenerates.
But this hakuna matata attitude doesn’t need to be reserved for seniors alone. No matter your class year, we can all make an effort—ill-advised as it may be—to live every spring like it's senior spring. Here's how:
Go Outside
You’ve spent the last three months inside, and you’re probably forgetting what it’s like to see the sun. But that shiny bad boy is back in town, so grab a couple of vitamin-D-deficient friends and venture out of the library. We promise that in the freedom of the outdoors you’ll feel less imprisoned by your crippling self doubt. Just watch out for Cambridge's unpredictable weather—you might just find yourself wearing salmon shorts in 10-degrees weather, and you'll never be able to live that down.
Don’t do that reading
Really. Don’t do it. You’ll be fine. Let a few of your less pressing assignments fall by the wayside, and you might be able to catch up on all the fun you missed during your childhood in order to get to Harvard.
Go for the spring fling
Ask that cutie in section on a date. There is no time like the present, so why the heck not? Yeah, it might not be the perfect match. Leave good decisions for dead-on-the-inside-fall you to make. Right now, bring on every-moment-feels-like-I’m-on-a-totally-sweet-water-slide spring you!
Do all the fun Harvard things you’ve never done
If you don’t have one, make a Harvard bucket list. And then cross it all off, even if it’s your first spring. You might never getting around to doing whatever it is that you crazy kids do in the stacks if you keep putting it off.
Make time for friends
Channel your inner senior and take the time to appreciate your friends. Or at the very least, adopt the nostalgic goggles of a senior in order to overlook their glaring flaws and enjoy their company. While this may not exactly be your last spring with them, but you don't have many more.
In the end, every assignment can be postponed if you're brave enough. Every day can become a vacation if you're willing to be put in the effort. Every night can be an adventure with the right attitude (and enough alcohol). And, indeed, every spring can be your senior spring if make a commitment to not caring at all.
Disclaimer: if you do every thing in this article at once, you will most likely flunk out of Harvard, so, you know, use that good old college discretion.
