After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Why did Zapata County, my Mexican-American hometown in South Texas, vote for a Republican presidential candidate for the first time in generations this year? And what does it mean that many of us liberals and leftists were shocked on Election Night that a county with an over 90 percent Hispanic population would do such a thing?
I don't have a lot of answers to this question, but I have plenty of theories. Reporting is starting to corroborate some, and others are based on anecdote and experience. Workers in oil and gas, two key industries in South Texas, perceive the Democratic Party to be hostile towards their livelihoods. Race and immigration issues, which the Democrats consistently emphasized, are not extremely salient for a community in which incidents of interpersonal racism are rare. The Donald Trump campaign appealed to machismo by identifying with policing and public pride. Each of these theories could be a book of its own, but my concern in writing this op-ed is to focus on those of us doing the theorizing.
While the support for Trump within my Mexican-American community saddens me (and angers me when I speak to my cousin), our collective surprise is rooted in our perception of what should be the natural order of the world: that certain marginalized groups would increasingly identify with the political left in this country. Much of the shock that liberals and leftists across the country felt about the election results — when Trump actually increased his support among multiple minority demographics — stem from our failure to consistently listen to and explore the perspectives from marginalized communities that don’t flatter our own perspectives.
At institutions like Harvard, we often already agree that we must listen to marginalized voices. But we don't generally mean all perspectives from marginalized communities. Too often, we only focus on the ones that match our political and cultural sympathies — narratives about the harms of bigotry or classism, and the proud traditions of resistance against broader oppressive forces. Classwork and panels abound on the treatment of immigrants and refugees on the Mexican border, the experience of transgender individuals in the diaspora, and the trauma of racism within our institutions of learning. While all of these topics deserve discussion and support, this practice has left us blind to the issues that do not match those expectations.
The world of South Texas is ripe for more nuanced analysis. From the outside, the region suffers from chronic underinvestment in its educational system and medical institutions. Federal and state leaders generally ignore the region — in my view, primarily because of its ethnic composition. The highest-paying jobs are in the body-breaking energy or policing sectors. Yet these realities don’t make everyone a nihilist — individuals develop self-narratives that help them deal with life's difficulties. Some match our perceived narratives of what marginalized communities should do and feel — but many don’t.
The family of an energy worker or sheriff’s deputy develops an intense pride in that work for its ability to put food on the table. A mother turns to God and pro-life politics, holding onto the belief of a better life through her faith, as a way to survive daily travails. An immigrant puts on the uniform of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent as a way to feel belonging in a country that often alienates him.
We have to be willing to listen to all of these stories, even those that might infuriate or seem retrograde to us. This does not mean that we have to change our ideals. As a political leftist and educator, I fight for a world where class, race, gender, sexuality, and religion do not determine our condition. But part of that work involves fully understanding the world around us — which cannot happen if we act as if the people whose lives we want to make better are without agency, rather than multi-dimensional human beings, many of whom may disagree with our analysis of them.
The mainstreaming of the trans-inclusive label “Latinx,” at least in more academic and leftist circles, presents a compelling example of debates around identity. I have found that the backlash to the term by more conservative commentators is more often than not bigoted, but it is also true that few in South Texas, and across the country, would identify as “Latinx.” This does not make the term illegitimate, or its use suspect — language evolves constantly. It should push us, however, to consider the distance between our sympathies and the realities of the people we hope those match onto. Much of our conversation in the academy does not match everyday people's concerns in South Texas, even when we use language that suggests we are being inclusive.
Everyone would do well to broaden the scope of their concern. For students from privileged backgrounds, ask questions that go beyond what you imagine of marginalized communities, and question who is speaking for whom. Engage in real historical study of these communities, not merely hunting for anecdotes that match your perspective. For those of us who choose to speak through experience, we should be mindful that we cannot claim to represent everyone we grew up with. Rather than fearing that we will be ignored, we should acknowledge that other individuals within our communities may have stories that contradict or provide nuance to ours.
My degrees and my distance, for example, have marked me in ways that fill me with skepticism about my ability to represent the perspectives of my community perfectly. I take on for myself the task of communicating those limitations when discussing South Texas or the broader Hispanic experience.
I don't have the full answer about why the people I grew up with came out to vote in 2020 like never before — and why a majority of them voted for Trump. But what is clear is that the left’s standard narratives of how marginalization determines political views are not enough. To work in solidarity with marginalized communities we say we want to help, we must do a lot more listening.

This past weekend was Diwali, the Hindu New Year. I associate Diwali with being at home among family, with rows upon rows of traditional lamps, and with the triumph of good over evil. But Diwali’s beauty can feel ephemeral. The dancing firelight eventually vanishes. The epic Ramayana, from which some stories of the triumph of good originates, doesn’t end so happily after all. The semester’s work comes crashing back after a weekend of cooking, cleaning, and family worship, and it’s like you had only been folded into a world of your own foolish construction.
This year, Diwali reminds me of my father, who underwent major back surgery about this time last year. The surgery was successful and my father is healthy. But for every year leading up to it, my father, a natural and skilled athlete, an intrinsically brave man, was perpetually in pain. I have vague memories of this fact, when he was a little bit more irritable after a long day of performing procedures as an indefatigable physician, or when he did not want to eat dinner at the dining table and instead watched TV from the couch. Still, it was only after I read about ankylosing spondylitis, the autoimmune arthritic condition that my dad has, on an organization’s website that I realized the degree to which people with this condition feel pain: “Bad days felt like grizzly bear claws and teeth ripping through my connective tissue and joints.” And, “I struggle to keep my mind positive and just want to cry… which on occasion I do.” For a time, I hardly believed that my father felt this kind of pain, because if I am having the least bit of discomfort, he is the first to advise ibuprofen. It is as if the fact that he has suffered from chronic pain means nothing for how others should learn to bear it, too.
A few weeks before the surgery, my mother called me and told me exuberantly that my father had finally signed up to take theological exams at the temple. These exams are meant to teach scripture of this particular Hindu tradition and ways of understanding the world and our place in it. They’re open to anyone and are purely for spiritual discovery and fulfillment. My mom had been urging my dad to take them for years, since, in her view, without the positive pressure of an exam, it’s tough to find time to read anything at all. After eleven years of taking the same exams, I can say with confidence that I’ve found this to be true. But my father always resisted, brushing it off jokingly as unnecessary, citing his busy work schedule as a valid reason not to do it.
“He’s finally decided to do it!” my mother was smiling at me from behind the screen. From behind her, out of the frame, my father called back, “Don’t get your hopes up too high!” I was shocked; I couldn’t be sure that his decision wasn’t just a brief, noncommittal comment to assuage my mother.
There are times when I resent the added burden of studying for this exam, when my friends on campus are stressed about spring semester midterms, and I am stressed about all of those things plus the fact that I am miserably underprepared for an exam — one that is supposed to tell me how to salvage the fate of my soul after death. The kicker is that having read by now thousands of pages on the subject, I still look at my father and think, here is a person who wastes no time drowning in theoretical faith. For him, faith is nothing like leaping off the edge, or a blinding firework, beautiful but short-lived. He is a person who enacts those theories and concepts that I only memorize. He is a person who is put to the test not once a year by pen and paper, but by nature. The word faithful has a longitudinal connotation, after all.
Diwali reminds me of my father because it’s not always jubilant and loud. Sometimes, like in the pandemic when we will not visit family members, it is quiet. It’s less like a firework and more like an image I cherish from the Bhagavad Gita: a lamp in a windless place. It is still and warm; it is transparent and yet substantial.
Six years ago, I stood in the winding line of a ride called “Leap of Faith” at a resort in the Bahamas. From the railing, I could see him, sitting in a reclining chair surrounded by our shoes and towels. While the anxiety preceding a near-vertical slide into a shark tank rose, none of us mourned the absence of the lone family member who sat near the edge of the pool reading. That’s because it happens every time. My dad always spearheads vacation planning, hurtling headlong into the logistics for every excursion, and then sits out when the moment — to lie on the salt-encrusted surfboard, to buckle into a humongous roller coaster — arrives.
It was me, my brother and mom and cousins, and aunt and uncle, who leapt off the edge that day and came up sputtering at the end of the slide with chlorine in our eyes and noses. But it was my father, that day and every day, who gave faith a new meaning, steady and quiet, performing nothing, and needing no occasion but normalcy to find good in the dark. This Diwali, when the last light dissolves, I remember this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ongoing — and in many ways worsening — COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities across the United States to radically rethink their approach to graduate education. Harvard hasn’t proven an exception: The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences announced that it will lower the number of admits for the upcoming school year. Harvard’s Graduate School of Education is pausing Ph.D. admissions entirely.
The decision is an undeniable blow to prospective graduate students. Going to graduate school has historically served as a cocoon during times of recession. But this go around, admissions shuttering is rendering graduate education less accessible precisely when continuing your education might seem more attractive than braving the ailing job market.
And yet it might be the right call.
Admitting fewer graduate students will allow the University to support the students it already has. The pandemic has imposed financial, social distancing, and research restrictions that are straining the graduate experience and severely complicating Harvard’s ability to deliver on the experience graduate students were promised upon admission and need to develop as scholars. With some types of research halted, funding tightening, and in-person interactions with peers and professors all but impossible, Harvard’s resources are already stretched thin.
We have written extensively about the need to support graduate students. When the pandemic began, we called on the administration to be generous to our graduate peers, advocating for a universal temporary stay on student loan repayments and bridge-year funding. Before COVID-19, we supported the graduate student union’s decision to strike back when our University’s labor tensions seemed likely to become the dominant campus story of 2020 (they weren’t). A dip in admissions, while regrettable for students hoping to study here, could ensure that our current graduate student body enjoys precisely the kind of resources and attention that they have always deserved.
Further, the University’s decision to reduce admissions occurs within a broader context that precedes COVID-19: discontent with graduate education itself. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences letter announcing the admissions decision claims that the admissions reduction will allow the University to address “existing and fundamental concerns about Ph.D. curricula, the well-being of students, and their employment outcomes.”
That said, we’re not as convinced by another of the University’s justifications: an “ethical responsibility” not to exacerbate the forbidding academic job market by admitting new students. We have resisted the notion that an education serves the sole purpose of pumping students into particular careers; passing on and producing knowledge serves a larger societal goal. We thought Harvard shared this sentiment. And given the number of individuals who use their graduate degrees in work outside of academia, this justification doesn’t necessarily hold water anyway.
Speaking of implications for higher education: We are especially disappointed to see that humanities and social science departments seem to be overrepresented among the departments completely halting admissions at schools across the country. This trend only perpetuates the widespread devaluation of these disciplines in an increasingly technocratic societal and academic moment. While Harvard’s approach affords more departmental flexibility than that of many institutions, we are concerned that the admissions reductions could more permanently compound this trend.
Finally, if the desire to improve the quality of graduate education is the guiding principle — as it should be — admission cuts are not enough. We hope to see this renewed commitment reflect elsewhere, starting with policies that adequately address the lack of resources causing discontent among graduate students well before the current crisis began.
The University absolutely has an “ethical responsibility” to graduate students; last December, graduate students struck to demand its fulfillment. A year later, there is no better time to reflect on that duty.

As COVID-19 cases increase statewide, the Cambridge Public Health Department announced a partnership with Biobot Analytics, Inc. Thursday to test local wastewater for viral RNA particles.
Infected people, according to a CPHD press release, “shed these microscopic particles in their bodily fluids,” which are then “flushed down the toilet into the municipal wastewater stream.”
Biobot published an article in September noting evidence that wastewater data can detect spikes in cases even before individuals develop symptoms.
“Infected individuals shed most frequently immediately after contracting COVID-19 — and start shedding an average of seven days before exhibiting symptoms,” the article stated.
Such data could also facilitate reopening, per the CPHD press release. Cambridge Public Schools were advised to use the data to inform its fall reopening plan as “one of the district’s three metrics for determining when to reopen schools or temporarily shift to all-remote learning,” according to CPHD.
Wastewater data will be made available to the public on Cambridge’s online COVID-19 data dashboard in the coming weeks, per CPHD. The department said the initiative was made possible through a “$175,000 appropriation from the Cambridge City Council."
CPHD environmental health director Sam Lipson said the department received the first batch of data from Biobot last week and that the results have a “24-hour turnaround.”
Lipson also said implementing the new testing initially brought logistical challenges; it necessitated “having knowledge and essentially a flow map of your sewer system.” Biobot and CPHD quickly overcame these difficulties, however, in part due to their long-standing association, according to Lipson.
“The founding members of Biobot were MIT grad students who worked with us while they were still in school, so they had done a fair amount of work in the Cambridge sewers,” he said.
Still, Lipson said interpreting the data remains a challenge, since the department will have to monitor the data and determine how closely correlated the reported rate of cases is with the signal obtained from the sewers.
Factors affecting the “lag time” between the sewage data and reported infections include the availability of COVID-19 testing and the time between symptoms occurring and testing, according to Lipson.
“There’s no standard latency, so we need to start paying attention,” Lipson said. “This signal is very likely predictive of infections that would occur in three to eight days, broadly speaking.”
“It's promising and exciting technology because it provides something public health rarely has, which is a real time metric for community infection,” he added.

Ahead of a decision about how Harvard College will operate this spring, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 reflected on the University’s successes in containing COVID-19 this fall in a Monday interview.
Prior to the fall semester, “a lot of the planning had to do with assessing the housing stock that we had available for students to live in, quarantine facilities,” Garber said.
Though the University is considering similar criteria for the spring semester, Garber said the experience of the fall semester provided administrators with more information, like “knowing how well our testing and contact tracing works.”
Harvard has seen a relatively low number of positive coronavirus cases throughout the year. Recently, however, the number of positive cases among University affiliates has been increasing in tandem with rising case counts nationwide.
The past week alone has seen a total of 72 new positive cases among Harvard affiliates — 34 faculty and staff, 27 graduate students, and 11 undergraduates. The overall positivity rate is also up to 0.43 percent.
“We need to be vigilant on campus because if our measures do not work with the rising prevalence off campus, we could eventually have a large number of cases transmitted on campus,” he said.
“Unfortunately, we've seen new evidence that that is about to occur,” he added.
Luckily, he said, the majority of undergraduate students currently on campus will leave in less than a week.
“We're mainly trying to ensure that we continue to have a safe on campus experience for them,” he said. “We will push hard for ongoing adherence to our testing protocols, to distancing, to mask wearing, good hand washing, and the usual public health measures that we have been promoting and that our community has been very good about adopting.”
Garber, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen reminded Harvard affiliates of these protocols in an email Tuesday.
They urged affiliates to wear face coverings “correctly” over the nose and mouth, practice social distancing, wash hands frequently, limit gatherings, participate in viral testing as applicable, and minimize travel.
“Our ability to resume some semblance of normal activity depends on our continued commitment to the actions we take to protect ourselves and our communities,” they wrote.
They also updated the University’s pandemic-related travel guidance, extending the prohibition of international and domestic University-related travel until further notice and discouraging all personal travel.
“Travel can significantly increase the likelihood of contracting and spreading the COVID-19 virus,” they wrote. “As much as we all want to celebrate in the presence of friends and family during the upcoming holiday season, we ask that you seriously consider whether travel is truly necessary.”
In the Monday interview, Garber also said he has also relied on meetings with other provosts across the nation during the pandemic.
A member of the “Ivy Plus” provost group, Garber said he meets regularly with provosts, data analysts, epidemiologists, and economists from the other seven universities in the Ivy League, as well as officials from Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago, Stanford University, and others.
Before the pandemic began, they met semesterly, Garber said. Now, the consortium meets weekly to exchange ideas.
“There are people from a variety of disciplines, but it's a very impressive, sophisticated group,” he said.

Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Transit Police arrested a man in Harvard Yard for illegal possession of a firearm Monday evening.
A police officer on patrol at the Harvard Square Red Line station reported spotting the suspect pushing through a fare gate, according to an MBTA press release. Upon the officer attempting to apprehend the suspect, the suspect rushed upstairs out of the station and into Harvard Yard, where he allegedly dropped a firearm into a pile of leaves.
Transit police ultimately stopped the suspect and recovered a 0.357 calibre handgun between Stoughton Hall and Holworthy Hall, two freshman dormitories located in the northwest corner of the Yard. At approximately 7 p.m., the suspect was placed into custody for several gun-related charges, including unlawful possession of a firearm.
The suspect was ultimately identified as Anthony Brown, 29, of Boston, according to the press release.

It’s not uncommon for incoming presidents to look to Harvard to fill their administration’s ranks. So far, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has tapped two individuals from a little-known arm of the University: Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
Annie Tomasini — a former senior director of state, local, and community relations and strategic outreach at HPAC — was appointed to serve as the director of Oval Office operations, a senior staff position in the White House. She worked as Biden’s traveling chief of staff during his campaign.
Tomasini started working for Biden in 2007 as he made his second run for the presidency. She later served as his deputy press secretary when he was the vice president, before leaving to join HPAC in 2010. She then left Harvard to return to Biden’s team in 2019.
Former University President Drew G. Faust congratulated Tomasini on Twitter Tuesday.
“Congratulations to @TomasiniAnnie on being named Director of Oval Office Operations and congratulations to @JoeBiden on a terrific choice! Annie is the best— wise, warm, super effective. We miss her in Boston but can’t wait to watch her do great things for the whole country,” Faust tweeted.
Jonathan L. Swain — who currently works as the senior director of media relations and communications at HPAC — was also tapped to lead the transition team’s “agency review team” for the Small Business Administration.
Under former President Barack Obama, Swain held two positions at the SBA. He was an assistant administrator from March 2009 through May 2011, before becoming the SBA’s chief of staff from August 2011 to October 2013, per his LinkedIn.
Swain has worked for HPAC since 2018.
He also runs his own communications firm, Swain Public Relations, part-time, and wrote on his LinkedIn that he provides “ongoing strategic communications support and advice” to former SBA Administrator Karen G. Mills ’75, who is now a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and a member of the Harvard Corporation.
Tomasini did not respond to a request for comment. Swain declined to comment.

Several athletes on Harvard’s varsity winter sports teams said they were disappointed — if somewhat unsurprised — at the Ivy League’s decision to cancel the winter athletics season due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The athletic conference announced Thursday that competitions would not take place for winter sports this year and that spring sports are delayed until at least February 2021. Additionally, the Ivy League canceled or postponed all fall sports competitions in July, but has now announced that it will not reschedule those events due to the ongoing health crisis.
In July, the presidents of the eight Ivy League universities also determined that sports teams could conduct practice and training during the fall semester as long as they were in line with each school’s respective health regulations. The Ivy League will continue to allow restricted practices and training next semester.
Liam J. C. Rotzoll ’24, a member of the men’s varsity squash team who is currently on a leave of absence, said his coaches had expressed hope in recent weeks that they might still have a chance to compete this winter. At the same time, Rotzoll said he believes the Ivy League made the best decision in light of the health crisis.
“The coaches were really trying to keep our hopes up to the very end,” Rotzoll said. “I’m definitely disappointed, but I think it was the best decision concerning the situation going right now.”
Madeleine P. Chai ’21, captain of the women’s varsity squash team, said she found value in the opportunity to engage in non-athletic endeavors without training for a competitive sports season.
“I wanted to use this semester as an opportunity to do more things that I normally can’t because of squash,” Chai said. “Playing a sport takes up so much of your time during the year, so now that I wasn't doing that, I had so much more time to do other extracurriculars — I’m super involved in politics, I was working on the Biden campaign, I was involved in the [Institute of Politics] a lot more, and I’ve been able to travel.”
Chai added that she decided against taking time off this fall primarily due to a job offer that required her to graduate on time.
Several athletes said they are having varying levels of success in maintaining fitness and training during the pandemic.
Annora Y. Lee ’24, a member of the women’s varsity fencing team who has been training on campus, said she felt “robbed” of a year of her sport, but recognized the reasoning behind the Ivy League’s decision.
“We all understand there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it, and it’s so far out of our control,” Lee said. “The upperclassmen are actually astonished that me and the other freshmen on the team are practicing as much as we are given that we don’t have a season.”
Rotzoll, the men’s squash player, said he looks forward to returning to competitions and has been trying to stay on top of his game in the meantime. He said the difficulty of finding COVID-safe training opportunities has led him to focus on staying fit for now.
“I try to play with someone maybe once a week just to have some matches to play, but I also have to be cautious because I'm living with my parents and playing with COVID, even in a mask, is still dangerous,” Rotzoll said. “Because, right now, it's a tough time to train, the most important thing is staying fit.”
Men’s basketball team member Noah A. Kirkwood ’22 also said he has had trouble finding opportunities to train in his hometown of Ottawa, Canada as he waits to return for his final year of college basketball.
“They’ve been really, really restrictive on facilities,” Kirkwood said. “[Until] two weeks ago, I hadn’t really been in the gym since March.”
“From a position where I was in there every day having access to coaching staff and facilities to not playing for almost seven months, it was a huge job,” he added.
Chai said that, while her senior year could have been different in another conference that has allowed competitions amid the pandemic, she does not regret her decision to play at Harvard and in the Ivy League.
“I’ve had such a great experience with the team here. We’ve won nationals the past three years and all my teammates have just been so great for the past three years,” Chai said. “So, even though it is sad I don’t get a final season, I think it’s great to go off on a high note.”

Monday court filings in support of federal prosecutors’ case against a former Harvard fencing coach and parent paint a picture of two men respectively beset by financial difficulties and intent on securing his sons’ admission to the College.
An affidavit filed Monday aims to outline the men’s motivations for allegedly attempting to game the college admissions system. Federal authorities arrested the parent, Jie “Jack” Zhao, and former coach, Peter Brand, Monday on charges of bribery.
As part of the scheme, Zhao allegedly donated $1 million to a fencing charity to launder money to the coach, in addition to direct payments he made to finance the coach’s lifestyle.
The affidavit states that those payments included $8,428.66 to pay for the coach’s son’s college tuition; $32,339.92 to pay off the son’s college loans; $119,051.52 to pay off a mortgage on the coach’s home; $2,573.45 to pay his water and sewer bills; $34,563.25 to pay for his car; $50,000 to help the coach purchase a condominium; $154,626.41 to finance renovations done to the condominium; and $989,500 to purchase the coach’s former home — $440,000 more than its market value.
Brand did not disclose to Harvard the payments Zhao made to him, or that Zhao made to finance his expenses, per the affidavit.
The charges mark the latest development in an athletics admissions scandal that first grabbed headlines in April 2019, when the Boston Globe reported that Zhao, a Maryland resident who is the co-founder of the telecommunications company iTalk Global Communications Inc., purchased Brand’s Needham, Mass. home in 2016 for hundreds of thousands of dollars more than its market value. Soon after the transaction, Zhao’s youngest son gained admission to Harvard College as a recruited fencer.
Zhao’s oldest son graduated from the College in 2018; his other son is slated to graduate in 2021, according to a Harvard directory.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay launched an investigation into the real estate transaction between Brand and Zhao soon after it was first reported. Three months later, Harvard dismissed Brand, finding he violated the University’s conflict of interest policy. Separately that summer, a federal grand jury also began an investigation into the 2016 real estate transaction.
Conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery — the charge leveled against Zhao and Brand — carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or two times the total financial gain or loss, whichever is greater.
An affidavit in support of the criminal complaint filed on Nov. 13 by Elizabeth Keating — a special agent with the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service — reveals Brand allegedly accepted roughly $1.5 million to secure the admission of Zhao’s two sons to Harvard. Keating wrote that she had “probable cause” to believe Zhao and Brand colluded from 2012 to 2017 to secure Zhao’s sons’ places at Harvard College as recruited fencers in exchange for financial support awarded to Brand.
In an emailed statement, Zhao's attorney, William Weinreb, wrote that Zhao will fight the charges in court.
"Jack Zhao’s children were academic stars in high school and internationally competitive fencers who obtained admission to Harvard on their own merit," he wrote. "Both of them fenced for Harvard at the Division One level throughout their college careers. Mr. Zhao adamantly denies these charges and will vigorously contest them in court.”
Douglas S. Brooks, Brand's attorney, wrote in an email that Brand did not break the law.
“The students were academic and fencing stars,” he wrote. “Coach Brand did nothing wrong in connection with their admission to Harvard. He looks forward to the truth coming out in court.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on Monday’s arrests.
Keating wrote in the affidavit that a Virginia-based fencing coach who trained Zhao’s two sons while they were in high school — cited as “co-conspirator 1” — facilitated the scheme by using a fencing charity he ran to allegedly launder payments from Zhao to Brand. Though “CC-1” initially helped facilitate the agreement, he allegedly also siphoned off the money Zhao donated to defray his personal expenses, including his own son’s Harvard College tuition.
CC-1 provided information to the government regarding the scheme in exchange for immunity from prosecution, according to the affidavit. Though CC-1 is not named in the affidavit, the Boston Globe identified him as Alexandre Ryjik, the head of the Virginia Academy of Fencing and president of the National Fencing Foundation.
Less than two weeks after Brand’s spouse informed him that they “maxed out our equity line of credit,” Brand suggested to CC-1 in a text message that he would recruit Zhao’s sons in return for personal benefits, per the affidavit.
“Jack doesn’t need to take me anywhere and his boys don’t have to be great fencers. All I need is a good incentive to recruit them,” Brand wrote on May 2, 2012.
While Zhao and CC-1 proposed to Brand that Zhao would make a contribution to the Harvard fencing program in exchange for Zhao’s sons’ recruitment, Brand declined. Instead, Brand asked Zhao to provide him personal financial benefits, according to an account of the arrangement that CC-1 provided investigators.
On Feb. 19, 2013, Zhao donated roughly $1 million to CC-1’s fencing charity. On Dec. 13, 2013, Zhao’s older son was admitted to Harvard’s Class of 2018. Later that day, Zhao emailed Brand, “Hi Boss...It is official now. I just want to thank you for what you did, really appreciate,” according to the affidavit.
On Oct. 10, 2014, CC-1’s fencing charity contributed $100,000 to a non-profit recently established in Brand’s name, funded by Zhao’s previous donation. Zhao then asked CC-1 to reimburse him for the remaining $900,000 he donated to the charity. But CC-1 refused to return the money, instead using it for his own personal expenses, including $31,571.75 towards his son’s Harvard tuition.
After CC-1 refused to return the money, according to the affidavit, Zhao began making direct payments to Brand — including the 2016 purchase of Brand’s home.
In addition to purchasing Brand’s home at an inflated price, Zhao financed Brand’s purchase of a car, Brand’s son’s college tuition, the mortgage on Brand’s Needham, Mass. residence, and the renovation of his Cambridge condominium, per the affidavit.
In summer 2016, Brand began recruiting Zhao’s younger son to Harvard’s fencing team. Several months later, on May 3, Zhao purchased Brand’s Needham, Mass. home. Brand used the money to purchase a condominium in Cambridge for $1.3 million.
The inflated purchasing price spurred city officials to inspect the house.
“SOLD TO BUYER FROM VIRGINIA FOR $990 K??? PLACE IS VINTAGE 1960’S IN BAD SHAPE???” a city assessor wrote. “MAKES NO SENSE.”
On June 24, 2016, Brand emailed an associate director of Harvard Athletics, informing him he had offered a recruiting slot to Zhao’s younger son and four other prospective students, per the affidavit.
On Sept. 20, 2016, Brand emailed a Harvard admissions officer asking whether Harvard had made a decision regarding the younger son’s application and that of another potential recruit. All recruited athletes have their applications reviewed by Harvard’s full admissions committee.
“We did review those two already and it looks good for both,” the admissions officer replied.

A post-election check conducted by the Cambridge Election Commission on Nov. 9 found no discrepancies between the audit and the election night tallies in one precinct in Cambridge, according to the commission’s report.
A Massachusetts law requires that a random selection of three percent of Commonwealth precincts hold a post-election audit after every presidential election. Ward 7 Precinct 3 in Cambridge was among the precincts randomly selected this year.
In addition to concluding there were no discrepancies, the post-election audit report noted that the only ballot “not marked properly” was a single write-in, in which the oval was not filled. The report adds that poll workers did account for this on election night, and the vote was ultimately tallied correctly.
Lesley Waxman, the assistant director for the Cambridge Election Commission, said the post-election audit was a recount of all the ballots cast in the precinct by Election Day, both in person and by mail. Mail-in ballots postmarked on time but counted after Election Day were not included in the audit, she said.
Though election officials received permission to process some ballots up to a week before the election, all of the early ballots for Cambridge were processed on Election Day and thus included in the recount, according to Waxman.
“It's basically a recount — a hand count — of all of the ballots that were cast, and then we compare that to the results that we had tallied election night,” Waxman said. “For places that have voting machines it is a good way to see that the voting machines count accurately.”
Waxman said she believes the biggest takeaway from this audit is that the machines counted the ballots accurately — something that will be assessed across three percent of precincts in the state.
“The Secretary of State's Office will be publishing the reports from all of the precincts that were audited for this election so I think people in Massachusetts will be able to look at that and have a pretty good idea of the results from this election,” she said. “Basically, three percent of the precincts will have been verified and if there are discrepancies, they'll have explanations for them.”
Waxman said she has “complete faith” in the voting machines as well as the poll workers’ training.
“If there ever is a discrepancy, it's usually because the hand count was done wrong, so if you do a hand recount, oftentimes the machine results are probably more accurate just because hand counts are prone to more human error than machine counts,” she said. “There's always some ballots that we need to count by hand on election night just because, you know, a ballot could be torn or absentee ballots — somebody could have spilled something on it before mailing it back.”
“This precinct only had two hand-counted ballots, and our poll workers were trained on how to tally those as well,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Political science professors analyzed how countries with federalist systems — those that combine national and regional governance — responded to the coronavirus pandemic at an online event hosted Tuesday by Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
Agustina Giraudy, a professor at American University, and Kent Eaton, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, argued that federalism caused Mexico, Brazil, and the United States to tackle the pandemic differently at local and national levels.
“We find that the strength and internal organization of political parties, the popularity of the president, and the coalitions that governors made explain why we saw such wide variations across countries and within countries,” Giraudy said.
Giraudy’s research on the subject relies on a “policy stringency index,” a measure that compares the relative rigor of policies that different states enact by taking into account factors like school closures and public event cancellations. For example, states that Trump won in the 2016 U.S. presidential election tended to have lower policy stringency scores than states that Trump lost, according to Eva Rios, a Ph.D. student at Brown University who co-authored the paper with Giraudy.
Giraudy said that, while the media has portrayed federal governments as ineffective in dealing with the virus, federalism does have some advantages.
“We have found in countries where you don’t have a president who is responsible that it is great to have federalism because you can have governors who can take care of that,” she said.
Giraudy also said, however, that local authorities may also choose to take less stringent actions in response to the coronavirus in federalist systems.
“It’s true that federalism may also empower governors who want to oppose stricter policies at the national level. Federalism is a double-edged sword,” she said.
Although federalist systems allow for disagreement on the national and local levels, Eaton posited that federalism is not “inherently disadvantaged” relative to unitary systems — where there is only one central government — in dealing with the virus.
“I think overstating the federal versus non-federal distinction really blinds us to the significant powers that subnational actors have in unitary systems,” he said. “In theory, the national government can withdraw those delegated powers, but they really often can’t.”
In an interview after the event, Harvard Government professor Alisha C. Holland, who led the discussion, emphasized the importance of comparing different countries’ approaches to a global problem.
“There are too few moments when Latin American and American politics intersect, and on an important issue like COVID, it is really wonderful to see scholars trying to look across very different countries to see how federalism impacted public health responses,” Holland said.

23andMe CEO Anne E. Wojcicki explained her view of the genetics company’s role in the changing world of healthcare and her beliefs on information privacy and consumer choice in a Tuesday webinar hosted by Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies.
The webinar, entitled “Benefitting from the Human Genome,” was moderated by Harvard Computer Science professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who also teaches international law at Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School. Radcliffe Institute Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin opened the talk and introduced Wojcicki.
Wojcicki said 23andMe grew out of a desire to put patients in charge of their own health.
“I want to be in charge of my health and this system that we all live in does not support you actually being in charge of your own healthcare,” she said.
Wojcicki also said she is opposed to “white coat supremacy” in the medical community — the idea that patients are incapable of understanding their own genetic information and need a doctor to explain it to them.
“What I found through my experience of volunteering in hospitals and working at [the National Institutes of Health], is that if people are given the right tools, they can absolutely step up and understand,” she said.
Wojcicki also said receiving six Food and Drug Administration authorizations — including one for testing for the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes which are linked with breast cancer — has earned 23andMe respect from both its consumers and the scientific community. To receive the FDA authorization, Wojcicki said, the company has to prove it can accurately test for a genetic variant and ensure consumers understand their results.
In a question-and-answer session with Zittrain, Wojcicki addressed concerns of law enforcement requesting genetic information from 23andMe customers, saying that 23andMe would never disclose the information. She also described the potential uses for 23andMe’s data.
“On April 6, I put out a survey about COVID-19, and I got over a million people to take the survey — over 25,000 people who said that they had COVID, thousands more that were hospitalized,” she said. “Very quickly then we could analyze the data, and we could put it in a preprint.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As of Tuesday, more than 100 new COVID-19 cases had been reported among Harvard affiliates this month as positivity rates continue to climb in Massachusetts.
The University reported 102 new coronavirus cases in the first 16 days of November — including 72 during the last week — among students, faculty, staff, and other affiliates who participate in its testing program, according to data from the University-wide COVID-19 testing dashboard.
The growing figure represents a sharp deviation from previous weeks. During October, Harvard reported 35 positive cases in total — including zero among undergraduates.
This month, 14 College students have tested positive, per the dashboard.
It is unclear whether the spread of the virus on campus contributed to the growth of infections among undergraduates. The University expanded its coronavirus testing program in September to serve nearly 500 off-campus College students living in the greater Cambridge area. Students who opted into the program received mailed testing kits to last through Nov. 22.
“Case investigation has revealed no cases within the last seven days involving suspected disease transmission within the workplace or educational settings,” a Nov. 17 note on the University dashboard website states.
According to Harvard University Health Services’ contact tracing procedures, the University requires affiliates to isolate for up to two weeks after receiving notice of a positive COVID-19 test result. Similarly, HUHS mandates a quarantine for individuals exposed to someone who tests positive. There are currently 85 Harvard affiliates in isolation and 227 in quarantine, the dashboard reports.
The spike in Harvard coronavirus cases comes as undergraduates living in campus dorms prepare to move out by Sunday and return home for the remainder of the fall semester. Harvard Business School announced Saturday it will transition to remote learning and restrict on-campus activities in light of increasing infection rates on its campus.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “monitoring closely and engaging with public health officials” in response to the rise in COVID-19 infections on campus and in Cambridge.
HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen thanked Harvard affiliates in a Monday email for their efforts to “limit the spread of the virus across our community,” but urged them to “remain vigilant” in the face of a nationwide increase in case numbers.
“It is critically important that we remain vigilant,” he wrote. “In fact, we have already heard from increasing numbers of students, faculty, and staff who have reported exposure to infected persons within their households and extended family.”
Nguyen wrote that “testing alone is not sufficient to keep the pandemic at bay,” asking affiliates to distance, wear face coverings, and practice personal hygiene.
“I know that many of us are experiencing pandemic fatigue. It has been a long road,” he wrote. “But, now as much as ever, it is crucial that we continue practicing the preventive behaviors that have helped to keep our communities safe to this point.”

Following President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s election, many of Harvard’s student affinity and advocacy groups expressed relief and reservations about the incoming administration.
As the election drew near, leaders of these groups — many of which helped organize protests against President Donald Trump’s administration — all emphasized the “high stakes” of this presidential contest, whether in relation to race, immigration, climate change, or sexual assault prevention. With so much on the line, anxieties ran high while the result hung in the balance.
Leo A. Garcia ’21 — co-director of Act on a Dream, an immigrants' rights advocacy group — said the election caused stress within the organization. This apprehension was especially intense among undocumented students who were unable to participate in the election but, Garcia said, were “directly impacted in very real ways.”
Connor P. Chung ’23, press coordinator and co-organizer at Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, emphasized the importance of this election due to Biden’s climate-focused policies, compared to what Chung called Trump’s refusal “to even recognize the basic facts of scientific consensus.”
“The thing about climate change is that it is so intertwined with so many other questions of justice and injustice,” Chung said. “So long as climate change disproportionately impacts low income people, communities of color, the most vulnerable populations at home and around the world, climate justice is an issue of racial justice, social justice, economic justice, and more.”
For Janna E. Ramadan ’23, co-director of external affairs for the Harvard Islamic Society, Biden’s promise to lift Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban” in his first hundred days relieved anxieties circulating within the organization.
The “Muslim ban” was an executive order signed by Trump in January 2017. The original order barred the entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries to the United States for 90 days, in addition to imposing other restrictions. In its current iteration, the ban also affects certain countries in Asia and Africa.
“What I'm hoping is that this administration will actively work towards racial justice and inclusion, and that it will be more unifying than it is divisive, and hopefully try to mend some of the damage that's been done,” co-director of external affairs of the Harvard Islamic Society Heba H. Mohamed ’23 said of Biden’s presidency.
According to Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA president Karla B. Chavez-Espinosa ’21, members of the organization perceived Biden’s win as a hopeful sign, given some of their negative experiences under the Trump administration.
Such experiences included Trump’s racist comments about immigrants and his repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration policy protecting undocumented children from deportation and making them eligibility for work permits.
“What we saw the past four years was very, very scary. To go through that again would have been more anxiety,” Chavez-Espinosa said.
Members of Our Harvard Can Do Better — an anti-sexual assault advocacy group — expressed joy over the departure of Trump and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos, whose Title IX ruling last spring elicited strong opposition from students.
This ruling required live cross-examinations in sexual harassment investigation proceedings, which OHCDB press representative William M. Sutton ’23 said he feared would cause survivors to feel less inclined to report their assaults.
OHCDB press representative Remedy H. Ryan ’21 predicted that Biden’s election would change Harvard’s Title IX and sexual misconduct policies for the better.
Groups like the Harvard Islamic Society and the Harvard College Pakistani Students Association also celebrated the victory of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who will be the first Black American and and first South Asian American to hold the position.
“For our club, seeing Kamala Devi Harris as this nation's first woman and first South Asian American to be elected as the Vice President of the United States was groundbreaking and inspiring,” co-president Fatima B. Taj ’22 wrote in an email. “To have this representation is moving, and we were excited to witness what is to come.”
Still, despite their excitement, many student leaders also expressed reservations about Biden's election.
Arguing that deportation under the Obama administration was “swept under the rug” in the public’s memory, Garcia said he fears that the public would again fail to hold the Democratic administration accountable to their promises to amend existing immigration policies.
“There are some feelings of initial comfort and initial release, but it’s also a reminder that it's important to continue holding any administration accountable, since both Democrats and Republicans alike seem to cause harm within the community,” Garcia said.
Likewise, Ramadan — the Harvard Islamic Society co-director — said she remains skeptical of the new administration’s ability to change “villainized” public perceptions of Muslims.
“The last four years have shown that a lot of people kind of hid their Islamophobia,” she said. “Now that we're under a new administration, it doesn't mean that they aren't Islamophobic. It just makes you have to go back to hiding it.”
In the same vein, M. Seven Richmond ’22 — vice president of Black Students Association — said Biden’s victory was dampened by the lack of “overwhelming repudiation of Donald Trump.” Garcia — the Act on a Dream co-director — also said he perceived the more than 73 million votes for Trump as evidence for persisting sentiments of xenophobia and racism in the country.
Many of these group leaders said that they will maintain their current advocacy efforts and hold the Biden administration accountable to its promises.
For example, both Act on a Dream and RAZA plan to hold the Biden administration accountable by continuing to advocate for the reinstatement of DACA, according to Garcia and Chavez-Espinosa.
Beyond advocacy at the highest level of government, organization leaders also encouraged students to vocalize for changes within local governments and school administrations.
At the local level, Garcia said Act on a Dream will work to hold Massachusetts accountable to amending its past history of “aggressive” immigration policies. For instance, the organization plans to continue advocating for undocumented Massachusetts students to receive in-state tuition.
Meanwhile, both Ryan and Sutton of Our Harvard Can Do Better said the group can more effectively support survivors of sexual assault by targeting their advoacy at the Harvard administration, rather than the federal government.
“It remains true that a lot of the things that we push for, and a lot of our advocacy is centered around things that Harvard has the power to do, to make the lives of its students better,” Sutton said.
Richmond — the vice president of the Harvard Black Students Association — said he wanted to warn his fellow undergraduates against complacency during the coming Biden administration.
“At the end of the day, we all have our goals and ambitions that are going to advance the state of Black people in this country, and we don't have to wait for the government to do that for us,” he said.
“We can...encourage our community members, wherever they are in the country, to be active and vocal, and not wait for the government to do what it's supposed to do,” Richmond added. “We are Harvard students, and if anyone has the capacity to do it, it certainly is us.”

Election Day, which turned into Election Week, is finally over! Thank goodness, I didn’t know how much longer I could last. Were you #trackingkornacki or counting how many times John King said “this is fun'' to pass the time? I know I was. Now let’s get down to it, how did our favorite “chartthrobs” actually manage all those days of reporting nonstop?
How Are They So Energetic?
Despite being up for almost 48 hours straight, these reporters approached every waking second of election coverage with so much energy. I think we could all use a dose of their caffeine regimens for our morning classes. Kornacki reportedly lived off Diet Coke to keep going, and King reports a combination of water and loads of coffee before and during his shifts. Plus, adrenaline baby!
No Zzz’s for These Guys
Who knew someone could have a worse sleep schedule than a college student during midterms, but these guys sure do! In the first 45 hours of election coverage, Kornacki did not sleep at all. Talk about commitment, I’d be falling over by the end of the first 24. Reportedly within the first four days King only got 10 hours of sleep. It’s amazing these guys stayed standing for so long with so little sleep.
Are These Shifts Legal?
I know it seems like our favorite “chartthrobs” have been on air for five-plus days straight, but including breaks their shifts have only been for 12-14 hours. It did cross my mind watching them seemingly never take any breaks if their shifts were of legal length, and yes they were! In actuality there are no federal laws setting a maximum shift length, but we can rest easy knowing neither of them worked more than 14 hours without some form of break. So MSNBC was not holding Kornacki hostage as many TikToks might have suggested!
Maybe They’re Actually Just Superhuman?
Maybe the best explanation for Kornacki and King’s crazy levels of energy coupled with little sleep and long hours of reporting and “quick math,” is actually that they are simply superhuman. I mean, has anyone seen Kornacki in the same room as Superman, or King in the same room as Captain America? I think not.
The Magic Walls
John King dubbed his map the magic wall this year, and man it looks like the most fun version of an iPad ever. The knowledge these guys have of counties across the nation and their abilities to come up with so many possible outcomes on the spot is impeccable. So many people across Twitter and TikTok wondered: how do they do it? Well, for one experience. They have each been covering elections for many years, King stating he has been doing so for the past eight election cycles. So over time, and with the help of some prep, they know their counties, stats, and probable outcomes.
It's Over, Now What?
There for a while turning on the tv and being able to see Kornacki or King was our only constant for Election Week. Now what are we supposed to do since their 24/7 coverage is over? Well, you can tune into “Inside Politics” Sundays at 8 a.m. EST on CNN to catch up with John King.
Our two favorite Massachusetts natives helped us stay calm and collected while awaiting election results, but also caused us to stress about their wellbeing. Maybe it was a tactic to distract us from our election anxiety all along?
