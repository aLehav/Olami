After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, Barack Obama uttered three words seldom heard in Washington: “I screwed up.” Yet following the implication of a third high-level White House appointee in income tax arrears, the president isn’t the only one who should be issuing mea culpas.Earlier this week, heath and human services secretary pick Tom Daschle became the second of Obama’s nominees to withdraw his name from consideration because of tax problems. This happened only a few hours after prospective chief performance officer Nancy Killefer did the same. Daschle explained that he withdrew so that his mistake would not “be a distraction” from Obama’s health-care initiative, but the sentiment was too little too late: Both developments unfolded in the midst of controversy surrounding recently confirmed treasury secretary Timothy Geithner, who was found to have delayed payment on $34,000 worth of income taxes. All things considered, the tax mishaps may have been honest mistakes, and none of the cases seem particularly egregious. However, at such high levels of government, even the smallest skeletons in the closet make national headlines. In the midst of two wars, a struggling economy, and a fledgling administration, the last thing Americans need is a reason to distrust their leaders. When those at the helm neglect such basic laws, voters cannot help but question their motives. Being in such visible public positions, Daschle, Killefer, and Geithner should have been especially careful to fulfill their legal obligations.For that matter, these problems should have been caught earlier—it is unfortunate that they should be commanding so much attention now, damping public confidence as the new administration fights to rally support for its economic stimulus package and carry out much-needed health-care reform. These cases make it clear that we should have higher levels of scrutiny over our civil service, demanding more tax records from public officials to identity these problems before they can cause such a damaging situation. Just like other citizens, politicians should be held responsible for paying their taxes. Daschle may have been a promising candidate, but America cannot afford even the appearance of a double-standard.Finally, this wave of scandals is the most recent manifestation of an inefficiently complex and bloated tax system. According to the IRS, more than 60 percent of Americans use professional help to prepare their income-tax returns. A convoluted system of deductions, rules, and exceptions, the U.S. tax code takes more than 66,000 pages to explain. Chris Edwards, a director of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute, remarked that just complying with the current tax system costs the nation around 2 percent of its GDP. In light of these recent examples and as part of larger economic reforms, the tax system should certainly be streamlined.But the complexity of the tax code is no excuse for neglect on the part of Obama’s recent nominees. It is disgraceful that these accusations had to come to light at so pivotal a juncture. Our new administration has made a commitment to leave behind the politics of the past, but, if Washington is to move toward an era of heightened honesty, paying taxes is a good place to start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1989, the circuit court in Escambia County, Fla., sentenced 13-year-old Joe Sullivan to a lifetime sentence for rape of a 72-year-old woman, with no possibility of parole. The grounds for Sullivan’s conviction were shaky. First, the trial only lasted one day. Second, the victim could not clearly identify Sullivan as the rapist, and biological evidence was not presented in court—and has since been destroyed. Nevertheless, even if Sullivan committed the crime, he did not deserve the punishment he received.No 13-year old child should ever be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. At such a young age, adolescents’ brains are very much still in a process of development. Young children should not be held culpable as adult criminals would be in many cases because children’s reasoning capabilities are not fully developed. This is one reason why young children should often not be tried as adults. What is more, the age-old adage that “people can change” holds especially true for someone just beginning an important stage of personal development. An individual’s brain and behavior change drastically throughout adolescence. It is not right, nor is it realistically possible, to assume that a 13-year-old who is guilty of a crime—no matter how grievous—will remain a criminal for the rest of his life.Confining a child to prison for the rest of his or her life constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, a type of injustice that the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits. The cruelty of confining a child to a lifetime in prison is self-evident. Such sentences are also unusual, for the punishment does not fit the crime—especially when, as in the case of Joe Sullivan, the crime does not involve homicide. Sullivan’s lawyers have recently petitioned the Supreme Court to consider this case and to determine whether the Eighth Amendment forbids such sentences for young adolescents.The Supreme Court should grant Sullivan parole and prohibit this type of sentence from being given to such young offenders. It is unjust and contrary to our constitution to sentence a 13-year-old child to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Ruling on this case would be a logical next step from the court’s 2005 decision in Roger v. Simmons, which outlawed the use of the death penalty for minors. The court should use the Sullivan case to build upon the precedents it has recently set regarding just punishments for minors convicted of crimes. However, while 13 is much too young for a life sentence without parole, courts should still have the authority to exercise their discretion in giving such sentences to older adolescents. Of course, in such cases, courts must use every method available to determine whether older adolescents are deserving of such harsh punishment.Finally, as Sullivan’s potential innocence demonstrates, both adolescents and adults alike should have more opportunities for appeals and review in non-capital cases. The United States is the only country in the world where a 13-year-old is known to be sentenced to die in prison—currently, 74 people in the U.S. are serving life sentences without possibility of parole for crimes committed when they were 13 or 14 years old. While the Supreme Court’s recent banning of capital punishment for adolescents is commendable, the court must expand this judicial review to non-capital cases to ensure that all individuals convicted of a crime, especially adolescents, receive appropriate punishments.

Tom Daschle, Barack Obama’s now-withdrawn nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services and the new White House Office of Health Reform, should have paid his taxes. It is the right thing to do, of course, and the fact that a man of his intelligence could not file a tax return properly—or that a man of his wealth could not afford a good accountant—is puzzling. 
But while ethics in politics is an important cause, it pales in comparison to that of health-care reform. While it would be nice if our politicians played by the same tax rules as the rest of the public, an improper tax return has never caused a death. A failure to mention a source of income has never kept medicine from the sick. By sinking the nomination of a man who had by far the best chance of enacting a fair and equitable health-care system in the United States, supposed liberals like the New York Times editorial board may have helped condemn our nation to at least another four years under the current unjust regime.
Tom Daschle is a unique combination: a health-care wonk and a legislative veteran. As someone who has spent his years since leaving the Senate working on health-care policy at the Center for American Progress and writing a book on the subject, Daschle knows the ins and outs of health-policy questions flat. He has even formulated his own sophisticated plan, involving a nonpartisan, Federal Reserve-like Federal Health Board to run the new universal program. 
Beyond his policy expertise, Daschle spent 18 years in the U.S. Senate, including 10 as Democratic leader, learning how to move critical legislation. The Clinton health-care effort was, in the opinion of most analysts, crippled by poor relations with Congress, and someone with experience as a leader in the Senate would be ideally suited to avoid that problem. Furthermore, Daschle was in the Senate Democratic leadership and on the critical Finance Committee during the 1994 health-care battle, putting him in an ideal position to learn the lessons of that failure. 
None of the names being bandied about to take Daschle’s place have both his knowledge of policy minutiae and his political acumen. Some are wonks, like Daschle’s would-be deputy Jeanne Lambrew. Others are skilled political operators, like Clinton chief of staff and Center for American Progress president John Podesta. But not one can match Daschle in both arenas. Given that both of these skill sets are to be critical in passing a universal health care bill, any possible replacement will not be as effective as he would have been.
It is easy to view Daschle’s withdrawal as a boon for the Obama administration and a strong symbolic stand against corruption. Robert Reich, for one, praised it as a sign of “no tolerance” for “the way things used to be done.” But with Senate Finance chairman Max Baucus expressing doubt that health care reform will happen in 2009, Daschle’s departure will in all likelihood perpetuate “the way things used to be done” in the American health system. And when said system will provide the worst health care in the developed world when an alternative was so close at hand, that’s a real tragedy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’d have to be an undergraduate to believe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is “complicated” and “controversial,” or to think there is right on both sides. So says Professor Duncan Kennedy, who sneers that these are “fairly common, understandable undergraduate attitudes,” before offering “context” (in an op-ed published in The Harvard Crimson on January 30) that aims to make Israel’s overwhelming guilt clear. 
Yet Kennedy’s “context” is filled with errors few undergraduates would make. He seems to be unaware that Gaza shares a border with Egypt. He thinks the recent war in Gaza began “at the beginning of the Obama presidency,” when it ended two days before Barack Obama took the oath of office. He believes Israel preemptively attacked Jordan in 1967, when in fact Jordan struck first by shelling Jerusalem. 
Undergraduates may err, but it takes a tenured professor to distort reality that badly. Kennedy is neither an historian nor an expert on the Middle East. What he is good at is thinking up radical ways to turn the academy upside down. He once suggested that the professors at Harvard Law School should earn the same salaries as the janitors. (After reading his opinions on Israel, you may be inclined to agree.)
Kennedy, like many other anti-Israel academics, attempts to reduce the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from a complex puzzle to a simplistic moral fable in which the apparently stronger Israelis, by dint of their strength and success, are always wrong and the apparently weaker Palestinians are always right. But he obscures basic facts of history and geography and misrepresents fundamental principles of human rights and international law. 
Israel was formally established after the United Nations voted to divide the land of Palestine between Jews and Arabs. In its very declaration of independence, Israel guaranteed equal rights to its Arab citizens. The Israeli courts protected Arab land rights and later outlawed discrimination in residential housing. Today, Israel’s Arab citizens benefit from affirmative action programs and are represented in the Israeli cabinet.
You’d think these facts would interest a law professor. But not Kennedy, who prefers a tale of “original sin” in which Israel simply drove Arabs from their homes, took their land, and oppressed whoever was left. 
Never mind the Jews who were expelled by Arab soldiers from Jerusalem’s Old City or the hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. Too “complicated” for Kennedy.
Here’s some “context” Kennedy skipped: when Israel launched its preemptive strike in 1967, it was under direct threat from Soviet-backed Arab states that had blockaded Israel’s shipping routes—an act of war under international law. Arab states still refused peace, negotiations, or recognition of Israel until Egypt agreed to peace with Israel in 1978 and duly recovered its territory.
Kennedy describes the 1967 war as though Israel set out aggressively to “generate” Palestinian refugees in some grim industrial process. He also gives bizarre dates and numbers to describe the growth of Israeli settlements in the territories it occupied. The first settlements began in 1967 and 1968—not 1973 as Kennedy claims—and the number of settlers is nowhere near the 600,000 that he suggests. 
Though Israel’s settlement policy was wrong and short-sighted, it was nothing like the rapacious image Kennedy projects. Israel did not “take over” Palestinian water; in fact, it pumps water from Israel into Palestinian homes in both Gaza and the West Bank. And Israel did not “exploit” and “starve” the Palestinian economy. In fact, the Palestinian economy boomed under occupation for 20 years until the first intifada in 1987.
Kennedy apparently has no better grasp of law than he does of fact. He claims: “Violent resistance to the military occupation is fully legal under international law.” He does not cite any such law, because there is none that privileges violence when nonviolent options are available. (Perhaps he has in mind the first Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention, which Palestinian terror groups routinely violate anyway.)
He adopts the same peculiar interpretation of human rights law as the UN Human Rights Council, which is dominated by dictatorships and which denounces Israel as a matter of course but never considers Palestinian violations of Israeli rights—or Palestinian rights, for that matter. He even slips in an obscure reference to “pass laws,” which existed in apartheid South Africa but are entirely foreign to Israel. 
Kennedy also cites a “Vanity Fair” article to argue that “Israel and the U.S.” planned to overthrow Hamas. In fact, the article hardly mentions Israel. But it does record that Hamas was cut off by the U.S., European Union, Russia, and the UN when it failed “to renounce violence, recognize Israel’s right to exist, and accept the terms of all previous agreements”—not because it won an election, and not just by “Israel and the U.S.”
Having provided his misleading “context,” Kennedy finally returns to the present day. In his view, Hamas is not the organization whose charter calls for Jews to be killed and rejects “so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences.” No—it is just a tragically misunderstood bunch, desperately seeking a way to accept a two-state solution and “save face.” 
It was Israel, not Hamas, that broke the ceasefire, according to Kennedy, because Israel “carried out an armed incursion” in November 2008. He does not bother to explain that the reason Israeli forces entered Gaza was to stop Hamas from tunneling into Israel to kidnap soldiers, as it had in the past. He trusts Hamas’s version of events, even though Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority itself, blamed Hamas for starting the war.
Moreover, he accepts Hamas’s inflated casualty figures—which hide the fact that many of the so-called “civilians” were Hamas fighters in plain clothes—without question and without considering Hamas’s admitted use of women and children as human shields, which is a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
Somehow, that “context” is entirely absent from Kennedy’s account.
In fact, Kennedy leaves out one of the most important events in the recent history of the conflict: the kidnapping, on sovereign Israeli territory, of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas infiltrators in 2006. That unprovoked attack helped trigger the Second Lebanon War. And, to this day, Hamas continues to hold Shalit illegally, denying him visits from the Red Cross and ignoring the principles of the Third Geneva Convention. 
Harvard’s motto is “veritas,” and it directs us to consider the truth above all. The undergraduate who sees the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as “complicated” and “controversial” has a far better idea of truth than the professor who takes terrorist propaganda at face value and imposes it as the definitive “consensus” view.
But some things are clear. Jews and Arabs have equal rights to self-determination. Hamas, armed and funded by Iran, is dangerous to both. Until Hamas gives up terror, or is forced to do so, neither side will enjoy peace. How to achieve that outcome remains a “complicated” question, unless you ignore the truth.

Two Harvard Square establishments and nine other Cambridge restaurants made Boston Magazine’s first ever list of “The 50 Best Restaurants” in the Boston area last month.
Square fixtures Rialto, which serves Italian food in the Charles Hotel, and UpStairs on the Square, which features American cuisine on Winthrop Street, both made the cut at 21 and 28, respectively.
Three other Cambridge restaurants—Hungry Mother, Oleana, and Craigie on Main—made the magazine’s top 10.
The magazine arrived at its list of 50 by paring down an original crop of 117 area restaurants reviewed in the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Boston Phoenix, the Phantom Gourmet, Yelp, Zagat, and online food discussion community Chowhound.
Restaurant owners expressed gratitude for the recognition, but their reports suggested the ranking’s effects on business were uncertain.
UpStairs on the Square, which earned praise both for its dishes and eclectic décor, saw a rise in business since the ratings were published, co-owner Mary-Catherine Deibel said.
“It’s hard to say what an increase in business is attributable to, but we are delighted to say that we have been very busy this January,” said Deibel.
But a few blocks away at Rialto, the month of the article’s release “definitely” did not see a rise in customers, according to Amanda Kozinn, the restaurant’s PR and marketing manager.
“January is a quiet month traditionally, and we’re seeing the same trend as in past Januaries,” she added.
In addition to printing each restaurant’s overall score along with details about cuisine, location, and entrée price, Boston magazine also included a section of tip-offs to star dishes called “Order This.”
At Inman Square establishment Benatti, which the magazine placed at 30, general manager Anna Encarnacao said that there has been an increase in orders for the porcini risotto highlighted by the article, though she said the dish has always been “very special.”
Deibel said that since Boston Magazine recommended the restaurant’s butterscotch pudding in its pages, UpStairs on the Square has seen a rise in demand for the dish, which she described as “a simple, great dessert made of custard and caramelized brown sugar served with a pecan sandwich cookie.” 
Even with a spot on the magazine’s top 50, Rialto is making other efforts to bring in customers in the midst of a difficult economic climate. Kozinn said initiatives such as $1 Oyster Mondays and a $40—rather than the traditional $60—prix fixe meal have been well-received.
But if owners and chefs all expressed gratitude for being included on the list, some of their customers had qualms with the rankings.
“Most of our regulars thought that we should have been ranked higher,” laughed Steve Johnson, chef and owner of Mediterranean restaurant Rendezvous, which was ranked at 35. “But we’re just happy to be on the list.”
The other Cambridge restaurants were Salts (12), T.W. Food (32), Dante (39), and East Coast Grill (45).

In response to parents’ concerns, the Cambridge Public Schools committee voted to hold a roundtable discussion on possible alternatives for middle school students with advanced math abilities.Math professionals from both within the district and the local community—including representatives from Harvard and MIT—will be invited to attend.Currently, advanced students can enroll in classes at the high school or participate in individual online courses, but these options are neither formalized nor widely publicized.“This has been bubbling up for a couple years,” committee member Patrica M. Nolan ’80 said. “We put the motion forward not to get an update on where we are but to move the district forward to address needs that are not currently met.”Nolan’s son, who is in middle school, currently takes geometry at the high school—an option she heard about only through hearsay. Nolan and other committee members said this should not be the case.“We need something institutionalized for kids who would benefit from an advanced math curriculum,” said committee member Marc C. McGovern.Nolan said that many parents of children who are not challenged by their math curriculum are concerned that the district has neglected its abler students.  In an e-mail to Nolan, parent Joy Lucas wrote, “As a parent I would like to feel confident that gifted children receive the same accommodations as struggling students.”Nolan said that the “irony of Cambridge” is that the high school “celebrates” the fact that its range of classes caters to students of all math abilities, but such opportunities are not as available at lower grade levels.Nolan also said that parents recognize that the fault is not necessarily with the teachers. She noted that math presents unique obstacles for teachers trying to accommodate students of varying levels in the same class.  The discussion, which will address these and other difficulties, is slated to occur before the start of the next school year.McGovern emphasized the importance of producing concrete initiatives at the roundtable.“If action doesn’t come from [the meeting], all you’re left with is a great discussion.”—Staff writer Sofia E.

With promises to push for greater budgeting transparency and to accommodate a wider range of campus tastes,  Kevin M. Mee ’10 and James A. McFadden ’10 were elected as chair and vice-chair of the the 20-person College Events Board Monday night. 
Six others were named as executives to the board, which is responsible for planning major campus-wide social events.
Mee previously served as the Board’s recruitment director, and McFadden was responsible for planning Yardfest 2008. 
According to McFadden, this year’s executives hope to continue expanding CEB’s jurisdiction beyond its three traditional events: Yardfest, Camp Harvard—the fall ‘Welcome Back’ celebration—and the Harvard-Yale pep rally. In October, the CEB hosted a “dinner and a movie” screening of “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist.” The event was paid for out of “surplus” funds that had not been spent on the big three events. 
The CEB which was created in 2006 to plan five or six major events each year, is allotted an annual budget of $200,000. McFadden said that a priority will be placed on pushing for “a tougher stance with [University] Hall,” which he said has traditionally kept the CEB’s budget inaccessible, even from its members.
“We know how much money we have to spend on the entire year, but the breakdown [between events] is not as clear,” Mee said. “We’d definitely like to make the breakdown more clear, and be able to transmit that to the student body,” he added of the group’s finances.
After this year’s pep rally with popular DJ Girl Talk was abruptly cut short, the CEB came under fire from students in and outside of the Board. Former presidential and vice-presidential candidates for the Undergraduate Council Benjamin P. Schwartz ’10 and Alneada D. Biggers ’10—who both helped organize the pep rally—were forced to answer questions during the campaign about their role in planning the botched performance.
Although the board’s success in finding a widely appealing artist was dampened by the performance’s abrupt end, McFadden said that the CEB would continue to plan events with an eye toward student tastes, rather than “some abstract University Hall notion of what students want.”
In November, the CEB conducted a two-part poll which asked students to name a preferred genre for campus performances and to create a wish-list of up to ten artists that they would most like to see perform at campus events. 
“Our biggest challenge is the fact that our responsibility is to appeal to the largest group of students possible,” McFadden said.
The CEB is comprised of 12 House representatives who are elected in December and eight members who are selected based on an application.
Tracy M. Spetka ’10 will serve as coordinator for this year’s Yardfest, Laurel T. Tainsh ’10 will coordinate Camp Harvard and Chris G. Kleinhen ’10 will be responsible for planning the pep rally.
Rounding out the executive board is Tobias S. Stein ’11 who will serve as secretary, Moira E. Forberg ’11 as Publicity Director, and Uyen-Trang T. Pham ’10 as Recruitment Director.

Google mistakenly blamed a little known Harvard organization this weekend for causing an error that briefly caused its search engine to warn users that nearly all Web sites contained potentially harmful malware, or software that could infect or damage a user’s computer without consent.
From 9:30 a.m. to 10:25 a.m. on Saturday, the search engine warned that clicking on most search results might “harm your computer.” The problem was fixed within an hour.
Initially, Google issued a statement on its official blog implying that a Harvard-affiliated internet watchdog group, StopBadware, was responsible for the malfunction. 
StopBadware is a research venture of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and is partly funded by Google. The organization works with the search engine to determine the criteria for identifying potentially harmful Web sites.
Google later backpedaled on its statement, conceding that the glitch had been caused by a simple human error. A forward slash was mistakenly added to a file that contained a list of potentially dangerous Web sites. As a result of this error, nearly every Web page was added to that list.
Max H. Weinstein, the manager of StopBadware, scrambled to correct the record, writing on his blog that “no data that we generate is supposed to affect the warnings in Google’s search listings.”
“Subsequent to that, after some e-mails and frantic phone calls, Google updated their statement to properly characterize their relationship with StopBadware and to correct that the error was on their end,” Weinstein said in a phone interview yesterday.
The warning typically informs Internet users that their computer might be infected with harmful software if they visit a suspect Web page, and it directs them to visit StopBadware’s Web site to learn more about how to protect their computers from malware.
As internet users around the world encountered the error page, traffic flooded StopBadware’s Web site. According to Weinstein, the Web site received at least three times its average daily hits. With such an increase in congestion, the site ended up crashing.
“I think it’s good that we raised awareness but I think it’s unfortunate that it had to be raised in this way,” said Weinstein.
By initially blaming a small, unknown organization for the error, it seemed like Google had hoped to transfer blame, but officials at StopBadware rejected that notion and said that Google’s quick response to the error was impressive given the complex nature of the search engine.
“In the heat of a very confusing situation somebody made a mistake and then very quickly retracted that statement,” said Law School Professor and co-founder of StopBadware John G. Palfrey ’94. “It’s the completely wrong reading that Google was looking for a scapegoat.”
Webmasters whose sites have been automatically blacklisted by Google can appeal to StopBadware to be removed from the list of flagged sites.

Facing a steep drop in the University’s endowment, the Harvard Divinity School is planning to reduce the number of visiting professorships and adjunct positions offered next year, according to an announcement by HDS Dean William A. Graham.
Harvard’s endowment lost an estimated 22 percent in the 4-month period ending Oct. 31, 2008, and University officials are anticipating a 30 percent drop by the end of this fiscal year. 
HDS relied on the endowment for 71 percent of its operating budget, according to Harvard’s annual report for the last fiscal year. 
Graham said that the school aims to reduce its budget for the next fiscal year by 4 to 8 percent, and will appoint only those visiting and adjunct positions “absolutely necessary to cover gaps in the curriculum.” 
None of the current visiting faculty will be affected by the decision, he said.
“We won’t have as many one- or two-term visitors as in the past,” Graham said. “In good times, we would probably be bringing in interesting people, even people that we don’t need curricularly.”
According to Graham, the cuts will not affect the regular faculty or “regular adjunct” faculty—those faculty members who regularly teach classes in a specific field. 
He said that the cuts will be of “area people that may have taught a course for us on occasion, or subbed during a faculty sabbatical.”
Graham said that he does not believe the cuts will have any significant impact on the curriculum. 
“We wouldn’t do it if that were the case,” he said. 
Judith Frediani, a denominational counselor and instructor at HDS, said that while adjunct positions are important, cuts are necessary and the school has few options.
“Every adjunct offering has a specific purpose. [Adjuncts] enrich the curriculum and diversify it, at a bargain for the school,” she said. “I wouldn’t want to be the dean right now, having to make these decisions,”
Apart from the visiting and adjunct position restrictions, HDS is also postponing some faculty searches, according to Graham’s announcement. 
He wrote that salaries for faculty and non-union staff will remain flat for the next fiscal year, facilities renewal projects may be slowed, and travel and events budgets will be reduced.
Graham said, however, that financial aid at HDS remains a “top priority.” At the Divinity School, 90 percent of students receive financial aid, 72 percent of which have their tuition fully covered. 
Graham wrote that HDS will maintain the level of financial aid currently offered to students, though it will be unable to meet its previous goal of providing total financial coverage for all students with demonstrated need by the 2010 fiscal year. 
“The Divinity School is very good about giving money to students,” said Matthew A. Lewis, a first-year student in the Masters of Theological Studies program at HDS. “From a student’s perspective, if keeping the kind of package they gave me meant cutting a few professors, I would prefer to keep my package and lose some professors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only weeks after Harvard’s Director of strength and conditioning Craig Fitzgerald accepted a job offer at the University of South Carolina, Daniel Perlmutter, one of his two assistant directors, has also announced his departure—leaving colleague Timothy Mullen in control of all 41 Crimson varsity squads.
Perlmutter’s absence will mean that one of the nation’s largest varsity programs will go forward with only two certified strength and conditioning specialists—Mullen and coaching assistant Shauna L. Forsyth.   
Perlmutter, who players call “Coach P,” plans to join the Duke University athletic department, where he will assume an assistant strength and conditioning coordinator role, overseeing the majority of Blue Devil varsity teams with the exception of football and basketball.
Fitzgerald’s departure in January raised little concern among coaches and athletes, as three-fourths of the department’s leadership remained intact. 
But now Mullen, aided by only a small staff of interns and Forsyth—who joined Harvard athletics this fall—must take the reins of the program.
To ease the burden for Mullen, Perlmutter will remain with Harvard for a number of weeks, preparing the staff to take over training for ice hockey, soccer, track, cross-country, volleyball, and skiing.
Women’s ice hockey tri-captain Jennifer M. Brine ’09 said that the transition is going smoothly, though Harvard will lose an important presence in the weight room.
“Coach P was our main lifting coach, and we’re going to miss him,” she said. “We understand he has a great opportunity at Duke that’s going to help his career out, and we’re very supportive. We’re going to take what we’ve learned from him and continue to keep that in mind as we lift.”
Having joined the Crimson in the fall of 2004, Mullen’s involvement with the program predates Fitzgerald’s arrival—leaving him with the opportunity to make a lasting impression as the lone holdover in a time of transition.
It remains to be seen how effectively the fourth-year coach will allocate his time, as the staff maintains a commitment to give all sports equal attention. 
Still, many Harvard athletes and coaches have expressed little concern about the diminished staff of the strength and conditioning department.
Jay T. Weiss, the wrestling teams’s head coach, embraced Mullen’s increased role with his squad.
“I think [coach Mullen has] been great,” he said. “He’s got a wrestling background and I really don’t foresee too much of a change with us... He understands [what we’re trying to do], so I’m pretty excited about it.”
Brine said that Mullen’s background in ice hockey will help his work with the women’s team.
“We’ll accept him with open arms,” she added.
By press time, Mullen had not responded to numerous requests for comment. 
“Obviously it hurts to lose coach Fitz and coach P,” wrestling co-captain J.P. O’Connor ’10 said. “They’re great guys and that’s why they got great opportunities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives from a Boston environmental group burst onstage and briefly commandeered a talk given on campus by a coal company executive yesterday evening.The activists, members of Rising Tide Boston, a self-proclaimed environmental and social justice group, came to the front of the room during the talk’s question and answer period and unfurled a banner stating “clean coal is a dirty lie” while listing grievances with coal as an energy source. As two of the activists held the banner, another questioned the speaker, CEO of Arch Coal Steven F. Leer, on the viability of coal as a solution to climate change.  When moderator Daniel P. Schrag, an earth and planetary sciences professor and director of Harvard University Center for the Environment, asked the objector his name, the man replied, “coal kills.”Several audience members responded to this statement with applause.The interruption concluded when Schrag asked the Rising Tide representatives to leave the stage.Before the disruption, Leer promoted clean coal technologies, such as Carbon Storage and Sequestration as a means of balancing increasing global demand for electricity with a need to stabilize atmospheric carbon levels.“I try to deal with facts, I was trained as an engineer. Let’s not let the perfect get in the way of the good.” Leer said.“If you really want to stabilize carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we have to develop carbon sequestration tactics.”He cited coal’s generation of 49% of America’s electricity, the increasing demand in developing countries such as India and China, and the global availability of coal as evidence that it will continue to be an integral energy source. “We want a reliable, affordable, clean and secure energy source to power economic growth in the 21st century,” Leer said. “The world is running out of energy, and CCS and cap and trade are opportunities to solve some of the world’s energy problems in a cleaner and more efficient way.”Leer’s goal is that the U.S. and Europe pioneer clean coal and CCS technologies in the U.S. and Europe and then export them to developing countries.Several audience members, in addition to the Rising Tide activists—who in an interview called the speech a “well-crafted” defense of an “obsolete” technology—were unsatisfied with Leer’s defense of coal. “Clean coal is like healthy cancer. I don’t believe it exists.” said Andrew Stern, Vice President of Citizen Advocates for Renewable Energy, which installed wind turbines from which Harvard buys energy credits.However, many audience members said they respected Leer’s pragmatism.“His basic message was that there is an enormous amount of incredibly cheap coal and people are going to exploit that—it is a fact, a reality,” said William W. Hogan, a global energy policy professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. “The trick, what is absolutely critical, is to find some way to deal with CCS...wishing we didn’t have to address this problem is wishful thinking.”Schrag said he appreciated Leer’s presence, calling him “the most progressive force in the coal industry,” and said he found the interruption objectionable.“[The activists] didn’t listen, they didn’t state their names, and it was rude,” he said. “There are lots of diverging views in this series. We must be tolerant of ideas, even those we disagree with.”—Staff writer Natasha S. Whitney can be reached at nwhitney@fas.harvard.edu.

Golden Globe-winning actor James Franco will receive the Hasty Pudding Theatrical's 2009 Man of the Year award next Friday, Feb. 13, the group announced earlier today.
Franco is perhaps best know for his roles as Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man trilogy and actor James Dean in the biographical TNT movie, which earned him the 2001 Golden Globe for Best Actor in a miniseries or television film.
The 30-year-old California native--who has also appeared in the 90s television series "Freaks and Geeks" and the films "Pineapple Express" and "Tristan & Isolde"--can currently be seen in the
biopic "Milk" across from Sean Penn.
Hasty Pudding producers Pierce E. Tria '10 and Charlotte E. Twaalfhoven '10 will roast Franco at New College Theatre Friday evening then present the actor with the traditional "Pudding Pot."
Following the ceremony, the Hasty Pudding will debut its 161th production, "Acropolis Now."
The Man of the Year award was first presented in 1963, twelve years after the group established its Woman of the Year award. Last year's Man of the Year was actor Christopher Walken.
