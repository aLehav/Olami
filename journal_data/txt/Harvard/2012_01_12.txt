After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has won both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, the upcoming South Carolina and Florida primaries will be critical in determining whether he can maintain his position as the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, Harvard professors say.
Romney, a Harvard Law School and Business School alumnus, won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday with 39 percent of the vote. Ron Paul, the runner-up, collected only 23 percent.
Despite the wide margin, government professor Theda R. Skocpol said, “I don’t think [New Hampshire] was decisive.”
“He did what we knew he was going to do all along,” Skocpol said. “South Carolina and Florida are the most important [upcoming] primaries.”
The winner of the South Carolina Republican primary has gone on to become the party’s presidential nominee in every election since 1980. Coming off the coattails of a win in New Hampshire, Romney is in a strong position headed into the South Carolina and Florida contests on Jan. 21 and Jan. 31.
But Skocpol noted that given South Carolina’s strong conservative leaning, voters in the state may be drawn toward Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, two of Romney’s more conservative opponents in the contest.
In a fundraising letter sent out to supporters on Wednesday, Gingrich emphasized the importance of the South Carolina primary. The letter said, “We’re going to do it next week in South Carolina or he’s almost certain to be the Republican nominee, whether conservatives like us want it or not. It’s up to you, right now.”
For many, however, Romney’s place on the Republican ticket already seems inevitable. According to a Gallup poll, Romney is the first choice among registered Republican voters nationwide. Another Gallup poll found that six in ten registered Republican voters believe that Romney will be their party’s eventual candidate, compared to 11 percent and 8 percent who predict Gingrich and Santorum, respectively, will clinch the nomination.
“I think he’s been the presumptive Republican nominee for a long time simply because there’s been a clear pattern,” Skocpol said. “He has money, he has a plurality of support, and all of the opponents who might assemble the non-Romney vote are dividing the vote.”
Trey Grayson ’94, the director of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, agreed that Romney will likely become the Republican candidate.
“Obviously from a delegate standpoint, he has a long way to go. But look at his campaign’s financial resources, organizational resources, and endorsements,” Grayson said. “No one else has emerged as a serious challenger for the nomination. If he finishes first or second in South Carolina, it’ll be hard to beat him in Florida.”
Yet pundits have frequently observed a lack of enthusiasm among voters toward Romney’s candidacy.
Antone Martinho III ’13, who said he is a conservative Republican, agreed with that view. “Republicans just don’t seem to like Romney,” he said. But he did not see a probable alternative. “In all honesty, I think Romney’s going to win. If anyone takes him, I think it’ll be Ron Paul. It would be exciting, but unlikely.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School professor Krishna G. Palepu was appointed to the newly-created position of Senior Adviser to the President for Global Strategy on Wednesday, marking the next step in the University’s efforts to define a coherent approach to its international engagement.
“I look forward to working with President Faust to craft a more coordinated and strategic approach to Harvard’s international engagement,” said Palepu in a statement.
In his new role, Palepu will guide the refinement and implementation of several of the proposals of the International Strategy Working Group, which formalized a set of recommendations in October.
Additionally, he will work to coordinate international fundraising and improve engagement with the 40,000 or so alumni who work abroad. As a senior advisor, Palepu will work closely with Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Domínguez.
Palepu’s appointment is the latest move in the University’s recent attempts to coordinate its international engagement. In October Garber explained that the impetus for the working group was that “the Harvard community and people outside the Harvard community...don’t see a deliberate University-wide strategy.”
“[Palepu] will be a critical contributor to the ongoing development of our global strategy,” said Faust in a statement. “The intellectual and cultural activities of our students and faculty across the globe will continue to grow as we head deeper into the 21st century.”
Palepu’s appointment comes at a time when peer institutions are forging ahead with new initiatives.  In 2010, Yale announced plans to partner with the National University of Singapore to open a liberal arts college in Singapore next year.
While the recommendations of the Working Group have not been publicized, the committee was expected to consider whether Harvard should partner with other educational institutions overseas or expand offices or global institutes abroad.
At the Business School, Palepu is the Senior Associate Dean for International Development. He is considered an expert on international business strategy, with a focus on globalization in India and China. In 2010 he co-authored the book “Winning Emerging Markets” with professor Tarun Khanna, which addresses the strategic concerns multinational corporations face when expanding overseas.
“I have the highest opinion of [Palepu].  He is intelligent and a team player that really cares about the institution,” said Khanna. “He is committed to excellence, good ethics, and has a lot of experience in fast growing parts of the world such as India, China and Brazil.”
“Krishna has been one of the Business School’s most sophisticated, eloquent, and persuasive voices for a thoughtful strategy of global engagement,” said Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, who chaired the International Strategy Working Group, in a statement.  “I know the entire Harvard community will benefit from Krishna’s vision and hard work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
Earlier this morning, we took a look at the matchup between Rebecca Nadler and Laura Gemmell. Now, we turn our attention to our second showdown on the women’s side: fencer Alexandra Kiefer v. hockey’s Josephine Pucci.
Alexandra Kiefer – 2011 NCAA Foil Individual Champion
No one in the country had a more successful 2011 in women’s collegiate fencing than Alexandra Kiefer.  Coming into the year with a tournament victory at the Garret Invite already under her belt, Kiefer went 9-0 to take the MIT Eric Sollee Invitational. A week later, the then-freshman went 15-3 at the Ivy Championships, taking second place.
But Kiefer never looked back after that, going 9-0 at the Beanpot and taking first place at Northeast Regionals.  At the NCAA Fencing Championship, the All-American and first-team All-Ivy selection grabbed 18 victories and earned a score differential of +42.  Avoiding former Olympian and two-time NCAA champion Doris Willette, who was upset in the semifinals, Kiefer took down Princeton’s Eve Levin 15-7 to claim the championship, becoming Harvard’s third-ever women’s national champ.  The Crimson finished the season in sixth place.
Josephine Pucci – 25 points, 12 goals, 13 assists, +/- of +24 (2010-11 season)
Josephine Pucci has held her own against some of the toughest competition in the world, and twice in 2011 Pucci helped the U.S. women's national team to victories. Before school started, Pucci and the U.S. went 6-0 at the 12 Nations Tournament and then took gold at the Four Nations Cup in November.
Pucci's selection to the national team came after a sophomore campaign in which she finished tied for third on the Harvard team in points with 25 despite being a defender, earning second-team All-ECAC honors. At this point in the season, Pucci is again tied for third on the team in points, and her play on the blue line has helped the Crimson post a 9-4 record thus far.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard secondary and special teams coordinator Tony Reno will be named the next Yale head football coach tomorrow, the Yale Daily News and New Haven Register are reporting.
Reno will replace former coach Tom Williams, who resigned Dec. 21 amid allegations that he lied on his resume regarding his candidacy for the Rhodes Scholarship.
With three years of experience at Harvard, Reno is also familiar with the Bulldogs program, having coached there for six years. A secondary coordinator for five of those seasons, Reno produced some of the top pass defenses in the nation, with the Bulldogs ranking third nationally in pass defense in 2007 and 2008.
While at Harvard in 2010 and 2011, Reno didn’t have the same level of success, with the Crimson ranking fifth and sixth in the Ancient Eight in pass defense, respectively. However, some of that can be attributed to the strength of Harvard’s rush defense, which forced opponents to work more through the air.
In 2002, while at Worcester State—his alma mater—Reno won the AFLAC National Assistant Coach of the Year Award.
Apart from his coaching skills, Reno also has years of experience as a recruiter. The head football recruiter near the end of his first tenure at Yale, Reno had recruited for the Crimson in the southeast U.S.
A press conference to announce the decision is expected at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard defensive backs coach and special teams coordinator Tony Reno was officially named the 34th Yale head football coach on Thursday afternoon.
After spending the past three seasons at Harvard, the 37-year-old former Crimson assistant returns to New Haven, Conn., where he previously served for six years as an assistant coach with the Bulldogs.
“Leadership-wise, I’m the right man for this job,” Reno said in his introductory statement at his press conference this afternoon. “I firmly believe that. I understand the challenge of Yale, I understand the challenges of coaching in the Ivy League, and I understand what makes Yale great.”
In just three seasons with Harvard, the reigning Ivy League Champions, Reno has had success developing talent such as All-Ivy defensive backs Derrick Barker ’10, Collin Zych ’11, and most recently senior Matthew Hanson.
Under his guidance, Harvard’s secondary ranked 21st nationally in pass efficiency defense during the 2011 season. The Crimson allowed just nine passing touchdowns all year, tied for fourth-best in the country. It also led the Ancient Eight with 14 interceptions, including three in the Crimson’s season-ending 45-7 win over the Bulldogs on Nov. 19.
“I think it’s a great opportunity for him,” Hanson said. “Obviously it stinks that we’re losing him as a coach, but for him and his family, it’s absolutely amazing. I wish him the best of luck.”
Reno also served as Harvard’s main recruiter in the Southeastern United States. His players described him as knowledgeable about both sides of the ball and a great motivator.
“He was really good at getting everybody excited and focused for the game,” senior defensive back Devin Saxon said. “He brought confidence to all the players, starting from the freshmen and up to the seniors.”
Crimson head coach Tim Murphy, this week named president of the American Football Coaches Association, praised the hiring and said he had already begun his search for a new defensive backs coach.
“This is a good move by Yale,” Murphy wrote in an e-mail. “Tony is a good guy, has substantial Ivy experience and will bring enthusiasm and professionalism to their program.”
Reno called Murphy one of the most “prepared, professional coaches” he had ever worked with.
“He prepares [his team] to be great players on and off the field,” Reno said. “Those are pieces I’m going to bring here to make Yale successful.”
Reno also worked with the secondary for five of his six seasons as an assistant with the Bulldogs. Yale won its first Ivy League title in seven years in 2006 and featured the third-ranked passing defense in the nation in 2007 and 2008.
“He did great coaching the DBs with us,” Hanson said. “Just the passion he has for football and for player growth, I think he’ll be great there.”
“He definitely deserves it," Saxon added. "He’s a great coach, he knows football, he’s been working hard, and he’s going to be really successful.”
Prior to his first stint at Yale, Reno served as a defensive coordinator and secondary coach at his alma mater, Worcester State. In his time with there, the Lancers posted a 27-5 overall record and made two playoff appearances. For his efforts, Reno was named the AFLAC National Assistant Coach of the Year in 2002.
He was announced as the Bulldogs newest coach—and its third in five years—at a 4 p.m. press conference at the Yale Bowl in New Haven. Reno reportedly beat out Lehigh offensive coordinator Dave Cecchini for the job.
“I understand the honor and the tradition of Yale football,” Reno said. “I want to build on that tradition, to build on that winning attitude and success.”
Reno said he had already begun recruiting on Thursday. He will replace former coach Tom Williams, who resigned on Dec. 21 amidst allegations that he lied on his resume in regards to his candidacy for the Rhodes Scholarship as an undergraduate at Stanford.
“We were looking for someone who understands what it takes to win, and we have found that individual,” Yale athletic director Tom Beckett said. “Tony Reno is a teacher, a leader of young men, and he loves Yale, and he loves the men of Yale football.”
Reno will now be faced with the task of turning around a program that did not meet preseason expectations last season, finishing 5-5. The Bulldogs have lost 10 of its last 11 meetings with Harvard in The Game, a mark Reno is eager to begin trying to turn around.
“Our team is going to be ready to go mentally, physically, and emotionally for each one of its football games,” Reno said. “I really can’t wait to get started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team’s backcourt took a hit this past week, as both freshman sharpshooter Corbin Miller and junior wing Christian Webster went down with injuries.
Miller suffered a ligament strain in his left thumb that has forced him to miss the Crimson’s past two games. Webster joined Miller on the bench for Tuesday’s matchup at Monmouth having taken a shot to the hip during practice.
“[Webster] didn’t practice Thursday,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He said he felt better, but he still wasn’t able to practice, so he’s been out. Corbin the same way.”
Amaker does not have a sense of when either guard will return to the floor.
“We’re taking it day by day,” Amaker said. “They weren’t able to go today, so I don’t know what that means for tomorrow either.”
Miller, a 6’2 point guard, got off to hot start in his rookie season, going 13 of 23 (56.5 percent) from beyond the arc before going down prior to Saturday’s matchup with Dartmouth.
Webster, the Crimson’s second leading scorer during the 2010-11 season, struggled through the early portion of the season, failing to reach double figures in the Crimson’s first nine games while averaging just 4.9 points per contest. But before being sidelined, the 6’5 wing had started to look more like his old self, posting 8.0 points per game in the six games leading up to Tuesday’s win at Monmouth.
