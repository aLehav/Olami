After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With classes over and Reading Period just starting, it’s the perfect time to go to a home game this weekend. And plenty of Harvard teams are in action today and tomorrow for Crimson fans to watch.
Both the baseball and softball teams also have matchups this weekend. The men have a doubleheader against Dartmouth tomorrow at 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and the women also have a doubleheader versus Dartmouth the same day at 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. The men’s team is looking to pull itself slowly out of a 9-32 hole, while the women’s squad looks to improve on its 30-14 record.
Finally, the men’s lacrosse team has a game today at 1 p.m. against Yale at Harvard Stadium. The men are currently 8-5, but the Crimson can improve on that record if recent history is an indication. Harvard has beaten Yale in five of the last seven meetings, but Yale came away with a slight 9-8 victory last season.

If you're looking for an easy way to make a few extra bucks before the end of the semester, you may be in luck. Although finals are quickly approaching, with them come storage hours—and some coveted jobs monitoring students as they rush to pack their belongings away on time.
The sign-up for storage monitor positions, which went live today, can be found on the Dorm Crew website. Students who have not previously worked for Dorm Crew will need to fill out some forms in order to receive payment, but otherwise, landing this job is as simple as signing up for your desired shift.
Positions are available in 10 of the undergraduate houses (all except for Cabot and Currier), and the pay is $11.80 per hour.
"It's basically one of the easiest jobs you can do, especially for what you get paid to do it," said Dorm Crew captain Victoria R.C. Palange '12, who added that the job consists mostly of ensuring that students properly label their boxes and list their stored belongings on the sign in sheet. "You can just bring your laptop and chill out," she said.
