After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in the NCAA tournament for the first time in their careers, the members of the Harvard softball team certainly learned one thing Friday night—they weren’t in the Ivy League anymore.
In its opening game of the Tuscon regional, the Crimson—making its fourth-ever tournament appearance and first since 2007—was demolished by No. 8 Arizona at Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium, falling 10-0 after the mercy rule was called in the sixth inning.
Junior starter Rachel Brown—who dominated the Ancient Eight during the regular season en route to winning the Ivy League Pitcher of the Year award—was rocked early and often. The 10 runs she allowed were more than she had given up in her previous six starts combined.
In the meantime, the Harvard offense stagnated.
The Crimson had a great chance to take an early lead against Wildcats starter Kenzie Fowler. In the top of the first inning, co-captain Ellen Macadam walked leading off, sophomore Stephanie Regan reached on an error by the shortstop, and freshman Kasey Lange singled to left to load the bases with nobody out. But consecutive strikeouts by junior Whitney Shaw and freshman Allison Scott and a groundout by sophomore Ashley Heritage killed the Harvard rally.
“We just didn’t have those clutch hits when we needed them,” Shaw said. “We weren’t really able to string things together and things didn’t really fall into place offensively.”
In the bottom of the inning, Arizona jumped on Brown.
With one out, Lauren Schutzler and Brigette Del Ponte singled and advanced to second and third on a passed ball. Schutzler scored on a groundout to first, and after a walk put runners at the corners with two outs, Wildcats’ second baseman Kristen Arriola ripped a double down the leftfield line to plate two more. Karissa Buchanan followed with a single up the middle before Brown was finally able to escape the jam, holding the Arizona lead to 4-0 after one.
Both teams went down 1-2-3 in the second, with Brown striking out two in the bottom of the frame. In the third, Harvard was unable to muster any offense again, while Arizona plated another run on a double by Lini Koria.
In the fourth inning, the Crimson threatened by putting runners on first and second, but Fowler got freshman Shelbi Olson to fly out to left to keep Harvard off the board.
“The pitching was very good, but I don’t think that’s at all an excuse,” Shaw said. “I think we definitely should’ve hit better, myself included.”
Brown held the Wildcats in check in the bottom of the fourth, but the Crimson was able to record only a Regan single in the top of the fifth. Arizona shortstop Stacie Chambers then led off the bottom of the inning with a homer to right, putting the Wildcats up 6-0.
In the sixth, Harvard was again held scoreless despite a leadoff walk. In the home half of the inning, Arizona went back to work with back-to-back doubles by Brittany Lastrapes and Schutzler. After a fielder's choice and an intentional walk loaded the bases, Chambers ended the game with a grand slam down the left field line, putting the mercy rule into effect and handing the Crimson its first shut-out loss of its season.
“When I made a mistake in the Ivy League, I could get away with it,” Brown said. “Whereas against these teams, they capitalized on [my mistakes].”
It was a career-worst start for the junior, who only struck out four after finishing the regular season third in the country with 11.5 punchouts per contest.
“I think when you start playing teams that are ranked in the top 10, every batter is that much better,” she said. “They’re that much faster, their hands are that much faster to the ball, everything they do is just a little bit better than what I’ve been used to seeing. And that’s not a knock on the Ivy League; the Ivy League has some great competition. But these are some of the best players in the nation.”
Both Brown and Shaw agreed that it was certainly eye-opening to play a squad with a history like that of the Wildcats, who have won eight national championships.
“Playing an Ivy League team versus playing a nationally-ranked team is definitely different,” Shaw said. “We went from being the big fish in a little pond to being a little fish in a big pond. [Arizona was] more comfortable playing in that bigger pond.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard junior Rachel Brown was back to her old self in the NCAA Tuscon regional elimination game Saturday night, holding Texas Tech to just one hit over 6.2 innings of shutout ball.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the performance of Brown—the Ivy League Pitcher of the Year—came far too late, as freshman starter Laura Ricciardone had already been rocked, giving up seven runs before she could even record two outs in the top of the first.
The Crimson offense, for its part, was unable to score for the second straight evening, and Harvard was eliminated from its first NCAA tournament since 2007 after a 7-0 loss.
“Nobody on the team had made it to the tournament before, so obviously it was a great experience for all of us to make the trip here,” Brown said. “I think we know now what it takes to get here and what it takes to win.”
Both the Crimson and the Red Raiders came into the contest after having been shut out the previous night, with Harvard falling to No. 8 Arizona, 10-0, and Texas Tech dropping a 9-0 contest to New Mexico State.
But on Saturday, the Red Raider offense was not to be denied, jumping on Ricciardone with seven hits in the opening inning.
Emily Bledsoe and Logan Hall led off with singles, and after a sacrifice bunt advanced them to second and third, first baseman Sandy James put Texas Tech up 2-0 with a single that was misplayed by Crimson freshman right fielder Shelbi Olson.
Holley Gentsch and Raven Richardson added two more singles to load the bases, and Taylor Powell followed with an RBI base hit up the middle. With the bases still loaded, Red Raiders’ designated player Cydney Allen ended Ricciardone’s night with a three-run double to right-center to give Texas Tech a 6-0 lead.
Brown—who finished the regular season with a 1.90 ERA but gave up 10 runs against the Wildcats—came on in relief and shut the Red Raiders down. The junior forced a ground out and a pop-up to limit the Texas Tech lead to 7-0, avoiding what could have been a forfeit before the Crimson even got a chance to bat.
“I knew, especially since we were down, 7-0, that if we gave up one more run, that was the mercy rule,” Brown said. “Out of necessity I really tried to limit their offense so we could still have a chance to make a comeback in the full seven innings.”
Brown would continue to contain the Red Raiders, giving up just one hit over the next three frames. But Harvard’s offense was unable to pick up the slack.
In the bottom of the second, Crimson junior Marika Zumbro led off with a single over shortstop before freshman Allison Scott and sophomore Ashley Heritage each struck out against Red Raiders starter Kelsey Dennis. After junior Whitney Shaw was hit by a pitch, classmate Jane Alexander lined out to end the threat.
Harvard put two runners on again in the bottom of the fourth. Freshman Kasey Lange led off with an infield single to second. After Zumbro struck out and Scott hit into a fielder’s choice, co-captain Emily Henderson walked, but Dennis got Shaw to pop out to the catcher to keep the shutout going.
“I don’t really have a reason for why we didn’t come out as strong offensively as we have been,” Shaw said. “We did have rallies at times, we did get runners on base ... [but] things just didn’t go our way.”
Brown continued her brilliant outing, putting Texas Tech down 1-2-3 in each of the final three frames. But the same fate met the Crimson offense, which couldn’t muster a hit in the fifth, sixth, or seventh against Texas Tech reliever Brittany Talley, who earned the three-inning save.
Sophomore Jessica Ferri struck out to end the game, eliminating the Crimson and dropping Harvard to 3-8 in the NCAA tournament all-time. But Shaw said getting a taste of the tournament left her and her teammates hungry for more.
“It was an unbelievable experience,” she said. “We wanted to show what we were capable of. Unfortunately we weren’t able to fully do that, but we know now it's a realistic goal to make it back. It was definitely an experience we want to continue, and make an appearance there year after year.”
The loss ended a record-setting year for Harvard, which finished with a program-best 36-16 record and an Ivy League Championship under its belt.
“We learned a lot from this,” Brown said. “It was definitely a sad way to end the season, but it certainly does not take away from the incredible season that we had.”
