After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a recent event held by the Harvard Undergraduate Constitutional Law Society, Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. made critical comments about Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, accusing them of lying to students about their reasons for dismissing him from his role as faculty dean of Winthrop House in May.
In spite of these controversial remarks, we believe HUCLS was absolutely within their rights in inviting Sullivan to speak to their group. Sullivan is a well-respected scholar within his field: He is the faculty director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute, has served on former President Barack Obama’s Criminal Justice Advisory Committee for Obama's first presidential election, and has reportedly won the release of more wrongfully incarcerated persons than anyone else in U.S. history. For an undergraduate student group interested in constitutional law looking to host an event fostering conversations on that subject, it is only natural to speak to experts who will do so. Sullivan is undeniably such an expert, and it is unfortunate the group faced criticism for their decision to host him.
Sullivan’s legal accomplishments, however, are separate from his consistent fumbling of the Winthrop debacles. At first glance, it’s easy to find fault with Sullivan’s comments about other administrators at the event, as he took the opportunity to level accusations rather than engage meaningfully with the events last semester. It is disappointing to see how Sullivan has framed the various events surrounding his leadership of Winthrop last semester, which misunderstands the depth and complexity of the experiences of those who were involved.
Yes, there is reason and merit to the fact that the University may not have been entirely transparent in the way in which they discussed their decision to dismiss Sullivan from his faculty dean duties. This is not to say Harvard was wrong in its decision, but administrators could have been more forthright in the ways they spoke of his dismissal and the incredible influence that both the alleged treatment of Winthrop tutors and his representation of Harvey Weinstein melded to create an “untenable” environment in the House. Nevertheless, it was inappropriate for Sullivan to air his grievances to the roughly 10 people in attendance at the event.
As a professor at the Law School, one’s presentation holds considerable weight and authority — not only on campus but to the world more broadly that looks to Harvard and its community as leaders in higher education. We hope Sullivan considers his actions alongside this role deeply — be they through this student group event, through his failure to file tax returns, his handling of the environment within Winthrop, or otherwise — and understand that these actions are influential, for better or worse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My tenth great-grandfather, Stephen Hopkins, was a Mayflower passenger.
Besides living in the uncomfortable ship for 66 days with his family, Hopkins was one of the Mayflower Compact’s 41 signatories and served as assistant governor of Plymouth during the colony’s early years. But like the colony and country he helped build, his legacy was imperfect.
A tanner and merchant by trade, Hopkins was a well-traveled man long before he reached Massachusetts. He was a minister’s clerk on the Sea Venture, headed for Virginia, when the ship got swept up in a hurricane in 1609 and left its 150 survivors deserted in Bermuda. Hopkins mutinied against the governor and was sentenced to death, until he gave a powerful address that ended up guaranteeing his pardon. (His story became the basis for the character Stephano in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest”).
Hopkins’ extensive experiences saved the Plymouth Colony during tough times. He participated in many exploratory missions and spotted animal traps laid by the Native Americans before colonists would have stepped into them. Most importantly, Hopkins was considered an “expert” in working with the Native Americans. When Samoset visited and welcomes the colonists, Hopkins invited Samoset to stay at his house for the night. In the following years, Hopkins was “sent on several of the ambassadorial missions” to trade and interact with several regional tribes.
His insightful experience and good nature were complemented by a rebellious streak. He was fined and apprehended for getting into fights with fellow colonists, including his “maid servant” who was pregnant with a dead man’s child. When the Plymouth Court deemed him financially responsible for both the maid and the child, Hopkins kicked the maid out of his house and “refused to provide for her, so the court committed him to custody.”
Plymouth Colony, however, was not a utopia. Hopkins incurred the wrath of the Puritans by simply opening a 17th-century saloon. On October 2, 1637, he was fined for allowing patrons to drink and play “shovell board [shuffleboard]” on the Lord’s day. A year later, he was fined for selling beer and a looking glass at twice their value. In today’s America, Hopkins would be considered a fledgling entrepreneur! And, while we are on the subject, if egregious markups were still a crime, Tatte Bakery and Café would be under federal investigation.
My ancestor sailed on the Mayflower and came to America in search of a better life. He represented the original “American Dream,” when people from afar could come to the U.S., no matter their circumstances, and better themselves and the New World. My other ancestors followed in similar footsteps. Another tenth-great-grandfather fought against Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar in September 1650. He was exiled to America by Cromwell and got a second chance. (He acted far less revolutionary in this new land.) My great grandfather, George N. Brountas, left Greece for the New World and ended up moving to my hometown, Bangor, Maine, in 1897. Desperately eager to escape poverty, Brountas made a living by selling fruit from a cart that he pushed for at least 30 miles every day. His effort and genial personality paid off when he opened up a candy store in 1903 with the money he had saved. The store soon became the Brountas Restaurant and my great grandfather purchased other properties, soon becoming a successful local businessman.
It is important to remember that millions of people from different places and eras came to this New World for a better life. And, in turn, this unique experiment that “began” in Plymouth 400 years ago, has benefited the world.
On November 23, 1944, wartime British Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke at the august Royal Albert Hall to a group of Americans in London celebrating Thanksgiving. At the time, Churchill and most Americans presumed that the Allies would defeat Germany and win in Europe. Without any notes, Churchill noted the “sober fact” that the United States had become a great military power, and that was “itself a subject of profound thanksgiving.” Implicitly, Churchill also gave thanks to the hundreds of thousands of American and British men who had given their lives in this effort.
Perhaps the most poignant moment in Churchill’s speech was when he explained why this war effort mattered. Contrasting and defeating Hitler’s totalitarian Germany was “the peaceful, peace-loving people of the United States, with all the variety and freedom of their life.” America was held up as an example for the rest of the world.
Then, as now, the U.S. is not perfect — just like the Plymouth Colony, just like Stephen Hopkins. But the U.S. has tried to embody mankind’s desire to seek a better life and better world — just like George Brountas and the many American men who died on the beaches of Normandy and throughout Europe, Africa, and the Pacific in World War II. In doing so, the U.S. should continue to develop responsible and engaged policies that continues to ensure security and peace throughout the world. But American foreign policy should also do something that we often forget about: improve ourselves. If the U.S. wants to continue being a leader in the world, a strong military and astute diplomatic serve are not enough. We have to look inward. We have to improve ourselves.
Thanksgiving is normally a charged political atmosphere for families. Two years ago, the Washington Post reported that “politically divided” families cut their Thanksgiving dinners short from 20-30 minutes. I am sure this year will be no exception. But I encourage you to listen to that “crazy uncle” and hear his opinions as you share yours. A substantive discourse among imperfect Americans — of all stripes — dedicated to bettering this nation and themselves will achieve those ambitions.
Most importantly, between finishing the turkey and devouring the apple pie, I will take a moment to give thanks for my ancestors and America — a unique, imperfect, and extraordinary experiment.
I hope you will as well.
Happy Thanksgiving.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, a group of students from both Harvard and Yale stormed the field during halftime at the 136th edition of “The Game.” The protest started small, with about 70 students, but gained up to 500 and extended for the better part of an hour.
The protest sparked discussion on social media about the impropriety of interrupting the game even before it ended. The Harvard-Yale game, after all, represents the culmination of student athletes' efforts for the entire year. For two teams that elect not to participate in post-season bowl games, this is their bowl game. And a 48 minute break inevitably throws you off.
Physically, your muscles start to cramp up. Mentally, your mind can lose focus. Game wise, the momentum that Harvard had before the half is broken and lost. That’s why for the players and the fans coming from all around the world for this event, the protest was inconvenient.
If you were one of the many students from our college that traveled from Cambridge for this event, the protest meant that you were out in the cold for much longer then you likely wanted to be, and it meant that in the eyes of some fans, The Game was ruined, politicized, or disturbed by the movement.
But good protests are inconvenient.
Protests do not happen when it is best for everyone. They do not accommodate others’ schedules or seek to minimize their disturbance. They’re loud, they’re broadly supported, and, most importantly, they’re clear in their message. Those elements were all met by Saturday’s protest.
Protests don’t always follow the law, either. Most of the students who stormed the field should have known full well that such an activity was grounds for arrest and possible disciplinary action, and some were arrested or given citations for disorderly conduct. However, in their minds and in mine, that’s okay.
It’s okay because sometimes, when you break the law, you can bring attention to a cause and elevate its importance. After a series of protest actions organized by the student group, all of which have been peaceful and all of which have been met with no action by the University, it becomes increasingly necessary to step outside of the legal and quiet channels that you’ve been using and make enough noise for people to take notice.
And it worked — people noticed Saturday's protest.
Within a few hours, major news outlets picked up this story and were making it national news. Celebrities and politicians were retweeting the pictures, posts, and videos from the protest and extolling the students’ activism as representative of the leadership that we need on an issues as crucial as climate change and divestment.
The protest elevated divest from a campus story to one of national importance. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with the protest, their claims, or their tactics, it is clear the protest worked.
We’re now set to see what the reaction of Harvard administrators will be. Up to now, that reaction has been filled with many words and statements but much less action. Very likely, they will continue to drag their feet on this issue, but on Saturday, Divest Harvard showed their willingness to take big action like never before and to persist on this issue until the causes of their protest are addressed.
We should all be proud that our classmates’ protest embodies the spirit of nonviolent activism — a spirit that has a long and decorated tradition in the cloth of American democracy and a spirit that has been critical to bringing about social change in the past.
If the administration won’t be a leader on climate change and divestment, it’s good to know that students are ready to pick up the torch and be the next generation of leaders. But as far as the protest: claims that the action was too inconvenient or that it was in the wrong place fall empty.
As we head into the last stretch of the semester, we are also faced with an impending strike by graduate students across the University. Then, too, we might hear students and others voice their concerns that the strike — another protest — is coming at an inconvenient time or that it is disrupting campus.
Of course it will be inconvenient, it’s a protest.
And it might mean being a little colder, not getting grades back right away, or thinking about politics on a day many planned not to, but for meaningful change to come, we must sometimes accept disruption, accept inconvenience, and understand that these are the costs of change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Stephanie R. Khurana — who currently serve as faculty deans of Cabot House — will step down from their post in the House at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year, the pair wrote in an email to house residents Monday afternoon.
Kirkland House Faculty Deans Verena A. Conley and Thomas C. Conley also wrote that they will step down in a separate email to Kirkland affiliates. The Khuranas are currently in their 10th year at the helm of Cabot; Verena Conley and Thomas Conley have led Kirkland for 20 years.
On Monday, each pair of deans addressed emails to house residents thanking them for their participation in house life.
“We are grateful to everyone for providing excitement and committing energy that have made what we believe is a strong and vibrant community,” the Conleys wrote.
“The opportunity to co-create the Cabot community with all of you has been an incredible gift, and we are so grateful for the experience of living and working alongside our phenomenal students, steadfast staff, and dedicated tutor team,” the Khuranas wrote.
The Khuranas came to Cabot in 2010 and stayed on through Rakesh Khurana’s appointment as Dean of the College in 2014. In many interviews since, Khurana has said his role at Cabot informs his work leading the College, giving him a direct window into students’ experiences. The pair cited a number of changes made in Cabot during their tenure, including the opening of the Cabot Café.
The Conleys are currently the second longest-serving faculty deans still in their roles. Adams House deans John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 and Judy S. Palfrey ’67 began their tenure just one year prior, in 1999. In their email, the Conleys reflected on the past two decades at Kirkland.
“Numbers speak volumes: since 2000, we have served under 5 university presidents, 4 deans of the college; we have had 10 resident deans, hired 100 tutors and graduated over 2000 students. And our 6 Bernese Mountain dogs have greeted students going to and from classes,” they wrote.
A pair of faculty deans leads each of Harvard’s 12 upperclassman residential houses. They oversee residential deans, house staff, and tutors, as well as organizing some house-wide events and serving in an advisory role for the students they oversee.
The Khuranas and Conleys’ departures means the College must fill at least three vacancies among its faculty deans.
Winthrop House will also welcome new permanent faculty deans, completing a search launched this year after Khurana decided not to renew former Winthrop Deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson in May. Sullivan faced intense criticism last semester following his decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, though Khurana cited the broader “untenable” climate in the house when he announced his decision. Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan currently serve as interim deans at Winthrop.
The faculty dean search process that will begin in the coming months includes multiple stages of vetting. The Dean of the College solicits interest from tenured faculty, forms a search committee, conducts interviews with students and tutors, and consults University administrators, before making a final selection.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution Monday evening in support of Harvard and Yale students arrested during a divestment protest at this weekend’s 136th edition of The Game.
The resolution — supported by all eight councilors in attendance — praised the protesters for “bravely taking a stand,” and called for both Harvard and Yale to “ensure” that all charges are dropped against the protesters. Councilors also offered solidarity with the protesters and said they stand with their demands.
“The activists are right to say that #NobodyWins until the universities fully disclose, divest, and reinvest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry and in Puerto Rican debt, putting an end to business as usual and taking meaningful action towards building a more just and stable future,” the resolution says.
Hundreds of spectators ran onto the field during halftime at The Game on Saturday, delaying play for more than half an hour. The protesters — led by both Fossil Free Yale and Divest Harvard — called for their respective universities to divest from fossil fuel industries and to cancel their holdings in Puerto Rican debt.
New Haven and Yale police eventually surrounded the protesters and escorted several students off the field, while officials called on the activists to return to their seats out of courtesy to the players. Following the protest, 42 students were charged with misdemeanor summonses for disorderly conduct.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the council’s resolution in an email Monday evening. Yale spokesperson Karen N. Peart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Swain has previously reiterated the University’s position that it does not see divestment as the best means to address climate change issues.
“The University’s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,” Swain previously wrote.
The Yale University Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan — who submitted the resolution along with Vice Mayor Jan Devereux – said the council had been in contact with Fossil Free Yale and other protesters arrested during The Game.
Zondervan also tweeted in support of GoFundMe campaign, organized by Fossil Free Yale, which will cover legal fees for those arrested. As of Monday evening, the fundraiser had garnered nearly $13,000 of its $20,000 goal.
“I hope you will support me on this resolution and support these protesters for their brave actions to bring attention to the climate crisis, and the importance of diverting from fossil fuels,” Zondervan said at Monday’s council meeting.
The Cambridge City Council voted in April to endorse Divest Harvard’s demands and joined the group in calling for the University to “show leadership on climate action” by divesting its endowment from fossil fuels. The resolution coincided with Divest Harvard’s Heat Week, which included a rally attended by Mayor Marc C. McGovern.
Divest Harvard and Fossil Free Yale did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Divest Harvard took to Twitter Monday evening immediately following the resolution’s passage to thank the councilors for their support.
“Huge thank you to Cambridge council member [Zondervan] and vice mayor [Devereux] for supporting our members who were arrested during the Harvard-Yale game this Saturday,” the group tweeted.
Fossil Free Yale also wrote on Twitter that it appreciated the council’s resolution.
“Cambridge City Council resolution expresses ‘complete and unwavering solidarity’ with us and calls for all charges to be dropped,” the tweet reads. “#NobodyWins when you profit off of climate chaos.”

Louie’s Superette, a beloved convenience store that sells beer and wine to Harvard students, is set to change hands after a 32-year stint in Cambridge.
Louie’s owner Cheng-San Chen — known to many Harvard students as “Louie” — said he maintained close relationships with student customers and took an active interest in their lives. Chen added that he wanted to ensure that Louie’s new owner would continue to engage with the Harvard community.
Chen sold the shop to Ravi Patel earlier this year. Patel said that he plans to update the store to cater to younger generations.
“We’re going to do renovations,” Patel said.
Mather House, one of Harvard College’s 12 houses, is located around the corner from Louie’s Superette. The store is a fixture of House life; Mather’s annual House-wide competition — which includes activities like a “selfie tag” competition during which members of the House attempt to take surprise selfies with one another — is named “the Louie Cup” after the store.
Last Friday, members of the Mather House Committee delivered a handmade goodbye card to Chen. The Mather House Instagram posted a photo of three Mather students along with Chen holding the goodbye card.
“Presented Louie with our goodbye card and said our final goodbyes! Gonna miss our friendly neighbor,” the caption reads.
Chen said his business’s success depended on his close relationship with Harvard students, and that he has encouraged Patel to maintain those connections. Chen also said conversations with Harvard students were the most valuable part of running the convenience store.
“I learned something new every day — about culture, politics, economics, technology, and editing,” he said. “To me, I think that was more important than money.”
Chen, the son of Taiwanese rice farmers, studied mathematics as an undergraduate before moving to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. in biophysics in Buffalo, N.Y. A copy of his diploma hangs behind the counter of the store.
Mather House resident Winnie C. Wang ’20 said she bonded with Chen over their shared Taiwanese heritage. She said that he often spoke to her in Chinese when she was in the store.
“It was nice to be able to talk to him,” Wang said. “It was kind of like having a pseudo-grandpa next door.”
Wang added the change in Louie’s ownership did not come as a complete surprise to students. She said Chen has regularly told students about his planned departure for the past three years that she has been in Mather.
“He has been warning us that he’s going to be leaving for quite a while,” Wang said.
According to Chen, students often tell him to write a book about his life. He said that his ownership of Louie’s Superette would only form the basis for one chapter.
“They asked me to write a book so I told Ravi, ‘I'm going to write the chapter one,’” Chen said. “It's his job to write chapter two.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following testimony from Richard M. Curran, the husband of the victim of a fatal September crash, the Cambridge City Council debated measures to improve pedestrian safety in Harvard Square at its Monday meeting.
Curran’s late wife, 67-year-old librarian Sharon Hamer, whom he described as “queen of the one-liners,” was struck by a truck and killed while attempting to cross the street outside a crosswalk on the morning of Sept. 17.
“Respectfully, given the present lack of clear and bold safety features in Harvard Square, to call it a super-crosswalk is absurd,” Curran said in a public comment to the council.
“I challenge anyone here to look at Harvard Square from Google Earth and tell me where the crosswalks are,” he added. “For me, sadly, there’s nothing super about the Harvard Square crosswalk.”
The city refers to the crosswalk between the Harvard Square Kiosk and the Harvard Coop as a "Super Crosswalk."
Curran said he is conducting his own “search for answers,” trying to find eyewitnesses to the crash while he waits for the Massachusetts State Police investigation to conclude, which he contended could take “long time,” given the length of past reviews.
“We’re kind of in wait mode, and it’s torture,” he said.
The Massachusetts State Police did not respond to a request for comment.
Cambridge resident Oscar A. Peña said he hopes Hamer’s death will prompt the city to add signage to the Square.
“In Harvard Square, I think they gotta get more signs because there's a lot of people walking all the time,” Peña said. “Sometimes, especially for the elderly people, they have a problem.”
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux previously introduced a policy order in a September council meeting calling on the city to study possible safety alternatives during the upcoming Harvard Square kiosk renovations.
Devereux thanked Curran for his attendance, and called him “brave” for speaking at the meeting. She noted the reconstruction of the plaza presents a “beautiful opportunity” for rethinking safety in the Square.
“I've actually spent quite a bit of time with him, including standing for about a half an hour last week in front of the Coop just to look at the traffic going back and forth and to talk about sightlines and visibility,” she said during the meeting. “And I think he's absolutely right that the super crosswalk is not so super.”
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said the city should continue to look at the possibility of making Harvard Square a “car-free zone.” Several councilors, including Devereux, have proposed the idea in the past.
“We've been over this before,” Zondervan said during Monday’s meeting. “And we shouldn't have to wait until somebody dies before we look at this.”
The city will hold an open meeting on Dec. 5 in the Smith Campus Center in order to discuss safety improvements in Harvard Square and gather public feedback on the plaza reconstruction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 28, 2019 at 2:26 a.m.
Harvard Management Company has sold its stock in Apple and Microsoft and more than doubled the value of its declared securities investments since the end of the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings made available earlier this month.
HMC — the University’s investment arm, which manages its endowment — reported roughly $1.07 billion in securities investments in its third-quarter filings, more than double the roughly $405 million it reported in securities at the end of the second quarter in August.
At the end of the second quarter, Harvard reported just over $100 million in Apple holdings and only $32 million in Facebook. Filings for the third quarter indicate that HMC sold all of its securities in Apple and increased its Facebook holdings to more than $400 million.
At the conclusion of the fourth quarter of 2018, nearly 83 percent of Harvard’s declared securities investments were in four large technology firms — Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google’s parent company Alphabet. Other large academic endowments had far smaller investments in technology companies.
The University’s most recent filings show it has added an additional roughly $8 million to its Alphabet holdings since the second quarter this year, bringing its total to nearly $130 million. Harvard also sold off all of its Microsoft securities.
HMC has also purchased more than $10 million of stock in cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks and nearly $50 million in Booking Holdings, a company that owns several online travel fare aggregators including Booking.com and Priceline.com.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment, citing HMC's policy not to comment on individual investments.
Harvard values its holdings in Facebook, Palo Alto Networks, Booking Holdings, and Alphabet at about $972 million, representing more than 90 percent of the value of its declared securities investments.
Technology stocks have performed well in 2019 compared to the overall stock market. The S&P 500’s information technology index is up 41 percent since the beginning of the year, whereas the overall S&P 500 has increased nearly 25 percent.
Nonetheless, the $1.07 billion Harvard reported in securities last quarter represents a relatively small portion of the University’s overall endowment, which is valued at $40.9 billion.
Harvard’s overall endowment returns have lagged behind those of its peers in recent years. The University’s endowment returned 6.5 percent in fiscal year 2019, its lowest returns in two years.
This year also marks the first year that Harvard will pay a tax on its endowment returns due to a Republican-led tax overhaul passed in 2017. The University has lobbied to overturn the 1.4 percent excise tax over the past several years to no avail.
The SEC requires investment managers with more than $100 million under management, like HMC, to disclose securities holdings annually. Managers are not required to report mutual fund holdings, but they must include their exchange-traded funds.

After divestment protests at the 136th edition of The Game on Saturday halted play for over half an hour and garnered national media attention, several Harvard Business School faculty offered contrasting perspectives on whether the University should divest from fossil fuels.
Hundreds of spectators stormed the field at The Game shortly before halftime ended, calling for Harvard and Yale to divest from the fossil fuel industry and Puerto Rican debt. Forty-two protestors were eventually arrested and face misdemeanor charges.
Business School Professor Shawn A. Cole said he sympathizes with climate change activists but has concerns about the feasibility of fossil fuel divestment.
“As long as I take a car or a bus or an airplane, it's disingenuous to imagine a world in which I wouldn't hold fossil fuels as part of a diversified portfolio,” he said.
Cole also said he believes “dramatic public policy change” will ultimately do the most to address climate issues.
Business School Professor Emeritus Joseph L. Bower agrees with Cole. Bower is the former chair of Harvard Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which advises the Harvard Corporation — the University's highest governing body — on investment decisions. Bower said fossil fuels play a critical role in powering utilities.
“When you go into your dorm room and you turn on the light, you expect there to be electricity, and for a long time, unfortunately, we're going to be using fossil fuel energy,” Bower said.
Divest Harvard, a student activist group that has called on the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry, declined to comment on the professors’ statements.
Business School Professor Sandra J. Sucher, however, said the climate crisis was “urgent according to any reasonable scientists,” and said she believes Harvard should divest from the fossil fuel industry.
“Harvard obviously does not go around purposefully doing actions that would stand in the way of mitigating climate change,” Sucher said, but argued that it was still necessary for Harvard to use its “prestige” to address climate challenges.
She added that if Harvard does not divest, others might think, “‘If Harvard’s not bothered by it, why should I be?’”
Business School Professor Rebecca M. Henderson, who conducts research on how organizations respond to changes in energy and the environment, praised student protesters for drawing attention to climate change.
“It’s great to see Harvard students getting really engaged with the issue,” Henderson wrote in an email. “In my view it is the great challenge of our time and we need to be moving with much more urgency.”
Henderson wrote that Harvard could still use its financial leverage to encourage companies to pursue more sustainable business practices even if it does not divest.
“If I had billions of dollars and a bully pulpit I would use my investments to call out/shame/punish those management teams who deny the reality of the transition and aren’t actively working to fix it,” Henderson wrote.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain pointed to previous statements Harvard has made on divestment. University administrators have long argued that divestment is not the best means for addressing climate issues.
“As it has done for well over a decade, the University will continue to support its faculty, students and staff as they pursue a range of innovative and ambitious efforts to accelerate the world’s transition to renewable sources of energy and to help mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change that are already being realized,” Swain previously wrote.
Cole said the majority of Harvard’s endowment is invested in hedge funds or private equity as opposed to individual firms and that that would it challenging to divest entirely and maintain a portfolio.
“I think there are other things that could be done that would have little to no impact on endowment returns and would encourage the university to consider those,” Cole said. “Wholesale divestment, I think, would have a big implication for the endowment's risk profile.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo has been an undisputed force to be reckoned with this fall, and time in and time out it pulled off big wins in close games. — five of the Crimson’s twenty-nine victories have been by just a single point margin of victory.
Now it is the first team to go undefeated in the Northeast Water Polo Conference regular season and tournament, with a historic 29-0 record.
“This season we’ve tried to play with a ‘shark mindset’ every day,” senior co-captain Charlie Owens explained. “Competing with a high intensity at practice made it easy to translate that focus to game days.”
Harvard earned a national rank of No. 9 by the end of the regular season, with the eight teams ranked above them are all based in California, considered the hub of American water polo. The Crimson consistently knocked off other ranked opponents throughout the regular season with wins against No. 9 UC San Diego, No. 14 & 15 George Washington (twice), No. 17 Pomona-Pitzer, No. 18 Princeton, No 17. St. Francis, and No. 14 Bucknell.
The Crimson’s thrilling 8-7 triumph over No. 19 Princeton this past Sunday secured a trifecta of the Northeast Water Polo Conference Championship, head coach Ted Minnis’s 200th career win with the program, and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The win came after a fourth quarter penalty shot from sophomore Alex Tsotadze.
Owens was named the Northeast Water Polo Conference MVP prior to the conference tournament this past weekend, in which Harvard bested St. Francis 15-9 in the semifinals on Saturday before matching up against Princeton the following day — a rematch of the previous year’s title game, in which the Crimson fell to Princeton 10-12.
Among other Northeast Water Polo Conference accolades, head coach Ted Minnis also won Coach of the Year, while Owens, junior Dennis Blyashov, sophomore Noah Hodge, and senior Austin Sechrest were named to All-Conference First Team. This is the first time that four Harvard players have earned first-team honors.
This season has also seen the Class of 2019 become the winningest class in program history, with 108 wins over the last four years as of the conference final. The Crimson are also the first conference No. 1 seed to win the NWPC championship.
The Crimson are set to face No. 13 Bucknell in the first round of the NCAA tournament this Saturday, November 30, here at home in Blodgett Pool. Earlier this season, on October 20, Harvard defeated Bucknell 9-8.
“Our focus is simply perfecting everything that we’ve done and worked on so far this season,” Hodge said. “We know that Bucknell is a strong team who will give us their best swing, but if we play our game the way we have all season and focus on things we can control, we fully believe that we’ll come out on top.”
The Harvard goalkeeper delivered thirteen saves in the conference final against No. 19 Princeton, adding to his season total of 243, now the third most all-time in a single season for the program.
The team’s last appearance in the tournament came in 2017, when it made it to the quarterfinals, and 2016 when they reached the Final Four. The winner of Harvard versus Bucknell in the first round will play reigning national champions USC in the quarterfinal, who finished the regular season tied at No. 1 in the rankings with Stanford. Given how the seven-team bracket is structured, Harvard and Bucknell have the only first round matchup, while the rest of the tournament is played from December 5-7 in Stockton, CA.
As the first round begins over this Thanksgiving break, that “shark mindset” will be as essential as it has been all season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down in a cold and rainy Terre Haute, Indiana, the Harvard Men’s No. 23 Women’s No. 25 Cross Country teams wrapped up their outstanding seasons in the NCAA nationals race. The men’s team pulled out their best performance since 1968 finishing in 15th place while the women’s team finished in 31st concluding a historic year for the cross country program as a whole.
For the men, the day was highlighted by a number of fantastic individual performances. Most notably, senior Kieran Tuntivate crossed the line in 28th place with a time of 31:12.7. This run was good enough for Tuntivate to be selected as an USTFCCCA All-America and marked the best Crimson finish since Maksim Korolev '14 captured third place as a senior. In addition, the Delaware product just the 7th runner in Harvard history to be named an All-American. This performance for Tuntivate is strong bookend of a fantastic career in cross country as the senior will have the spring to run his final races in the crimson uniform.
Behind Tuntivate was standout first-year Colin Baker who placed 48th and steady junior Matthew Pereira who placed in 75th. Baker was the second-highest finishing true freshman in the biggest cross country race in the nation. As talented seniors like Tuntivate and Will Battershill graduate, younger members like Baker will have to step up and continue to perform. If this race is any indication, the Crimson are still set with Pereira and Baker returning next year.
“We wanted to be the drivers of Harvard’s transformation into a national powerhouse,” said senior captain Charlie Davis on the future of the team. “This season is just the beginning, and future teams will have it on their shoulders to make sure Harvard cross country smashes the bar we set this season.”
Just outside the top 100 were Battershill who placed in 108th and junior Milner who placed in 196th. Jumping a couple of spots for the final few scorers for Havard could have meant knocking on the door for top ten in team scoring. Nonetheless, the Crimson squad raced well and, in a year of so many records, placed the highest they have ever placed as a team in over half a century.
“At the beginning of the season 3 months ago, we sat down as a men’s team and talked about where we wanted to take Harvard cross country this year. All the guys really came together around making the commitment to establish ourselves not only at the top of the Ivy League, but to really put ourselves on the map at the national level,” commented Davis on the team’s season. “On Saturday we did that. Watching our guys come through the finish chute executing a race that was a culmination of years of hard work for this group was incredible.”
The Harvard women wrapped up their underdog season with a respectable 31st place finish in a strong field of runners. Leading the Crimson, as she has for much of the season, was junior Anna Juul who broke into the top 100 finishing in 94th with a time 21:13.2. In addition to her strong performance on course, Juul was also selected for the prestigious Elite 90 award. This award acknowledges athletes who show incredible dedication both on and off the field by going to the competitor at the NCAA championships for a given sport with the highest GPA. In addition to Juul’s strong running season, the religious studies major has a perfect 4.00 in the classroom. Juul is just the third Harvard athlete ever to receive the award, as she embodies what it means to be a true student athlete.
Behind Juul was standout first-year Iz Sagar in 185th, junior Brooke Starn in 204th, senior co-captain Gillian Meeks in 229th, and to wrap up the scoring for the Crimson junior Judy Pendergast in 251st. Needless to say, the Harvard women didn’t have the performance they wanted. However, simply getting to the NCAA nationals is an incredible accomplishment for a team who placed 6th in the Ivy League last year.
“To be honest, it wasn’t looking great from a team scoring perspective in the beginning of October. However, we not only had our injured team members work hard to get back quickly and smoothly from injury, but also everyone, including people who were racing and those who weren’t, really banded together as a team once Heps came around,” Meeks said. “We put away the doubts we had about whether or not everyone was fully ready to race, and just raced for each other. Incredibly, that mindset rubbed off on everyone and we ended up having our best finish at Regionals since I’ve been here and the best place for Harvard at Regionals in many years.”
Across the program the runners have had overwhelming success at least in part due to a talented and hardworking coaching staff. As a result, Associate Head Coach Alex Gibby was given the award for the coach of the year for both the men’s and women’s teams in the Northeast Region.
For many talented seniors, this race was their last as a Crimson cross country runner.
“There is something really special about achieving a goal that is the culmination of thousands of miles run, committing to recovery day in and day out, and racing with grit, not just for yourself but for the guys on the line with you and for the H on your chest,” said Davis when reflecting on his time with the team. “It has been an incredible past few years on this team. It has taken so much hard work and dedication on the part of all of our guys to get to this level, and I’m so happy that it’s paying off.”
Many seniors have not fully internalized what it means that this was their last race in the crimson uniform. Meeks had strong words about her experience on the cross country team.
“My time on the Harvard cross country team has been one of the most challenging yet most rewarding experiences of my life. I feel so lucky to have been able to compete in every cross country race with the team since arriving on campus, and to witness the immense growth of the team culture from my freshman year until now,” Meeks commented. “I’m incredibly grateful to have ended my time on Harvard’s XC team on such a high note, but most importantly I’m so thankful for the everyday experiences on the team and the lifelong friendships I’ve built. I’m excited to watch the team crush it next year from afar as I think Harvard XC is just going to keep getting stronger. It still hasn’t hit me that I won’t be here next year wearing the Crimson H, racing through the mud with my teammates.”
Tuntivate echoed similar sentiments when asked about his reflection of his time with the team.
This being my last season hasn’t really registered,” Tuntivate said. “We’ve always had a ‘let’s be better next year’ mindset and it’s kind of hard not to have that even though I’m not going to be on the team next year. I’m really excited for the future of Harvard XC, we have really good runners and an awesome coach and I look forward to seeing what they do in the future.”
Harvard Cross Country will return in official capacity next fall but most runners will be competing in the spring in track. Tune in to the track season to watch these talented runners continue to compete and impress on the biggest stages.

The brunch experience isn’t complete without trying a Veritaffle at least once, but not everyone is here for the Veritaffle experience
Love It: Veritaffles for Life — Emily H. Nguyen
What better way to start your Sunday than with a waffle that reminds you what school you go to? Being able to say that you made your own breakfast is also an added plus. There’s no reason to drop an extra $10 on avocado toast when you can get a free waffle every Sunday. Waiting in line to make your waffle is justified by the fact that you made it yourself, so your food actually looks good and appetizing for once.
Let’s not forget about the Veritas seal itself — there’s nothing that screams Harvard more than eating a waffle with a Harvard crest. Nothing beats the Veritas flex you can force on your family and loyal Instagram followers. Let’s not forget the lovely conversations you can have while waiting in line and meeting fellow Veritaffle fans — you can’t get all of that from the standard french toast and pancakes. Veritaffles are reserved for that Sunday slump, and the sugar from the waffle sweetens an otherwise bitter day.
Hate it: Veritaffle more like Verit-awful — Janani Sekar
Every Sunday, you wake up dreading the fact that weekend is almost over and you’ve put off all those psets. You make your way to the dhall hoping to eat a nice, quiet breakfast, only to find that the Veritaffle irons are out along with everything that sucks about them.
The biggest problem with Veritaffles is the line, especially in Annenberg. You know it’s Sunday when you walk into the dhall and can’t see past everyone waiting for their Veritaffle. They’ve been there for 40 minutes. Just get toast or Apple Zings — it’s just not worth being that hungry.
If you’re lucky enough to make a Veritaffle, you’ll realize it’s not worth the hype. Waffles are the online dating version of breakfast food — they seem great from far away and then just don’t live up to your expectations. And fine, maybe it’s exciting because the Veritaffle is a fancy take on the normal square waffle pattern, but you’re going to cover it with syrup and whipped cream anyway so does it really matter?
If you’re not yet convinced that Veritaffles are a breakfast food worthy of scorn, think about how obnoxious they are. Harvard merch is everywhere already, so is it really necessary to see it on a waffle too? At least a T-shirt or a lanyard lasts longer than 15 minutes.
