After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A deadly and seemingly unstoppable virus terrorizes the globe in Oscar-winner Steven Soderbergh’s star-studded new film, “Contagion.” The project boasts an impressive billing, sporting no less than four Oscar-winning actors—Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, and Gwyneth Paltrow. With such a reputable team and an impressively chilling trailer, the film set the bar quite high for itself—and so it was perhaps inevitable that the movie falls short of its expectations.
“Contagion” succeeds as a film about a virus, but not so much as one about people. Soderbergh abandons all pretense of subtlety in his mission to bestow upon audience members a deep-seated fear of all things touchable. The camera lingers at hand-level rather than eye-level for most of the shots, as we watch hands shake, drinks pass, credit cards swipe, and other mundane tasks unfold, now imbued with an underlying sense of doom. A mute, sickly color palette tinted with greens and blues enforces a constant aura of disease and decay as we watch character after character succumb to the mysterious killer, beginning with Gwyneth Paltrow in the film’s opening minutes. And nothing about the dead bodies is left to the imagination—gruesome makeup and special effects allow us to see every vivid detail, from seizure to autopsy.
All the while, an international team of researchers races against the clock as the number of victims mounts exponentially with each passing day. Hong Kong, Macao, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco, Abu Dhabi, London, and Geneva make cameos as feverish global lab work ensues and experts debate how to control and guide the public during the outbreak.
But even with such high stakes and stylized images, “Contagion” doesn’t manage to nail elements of either drama or thriller. Characters are painfully flat and all too similar to each other. Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, and Marion Cotillard play almost indistinguishable breeds of doctor, all with the same goal and too few engaging interactions. The addition of a human element is attempted with Matt Damon’s narrative, as he tries to protect his last remaining family member, a teenage daughter played by newcomer Anna Jacoby-Heron. But the attempt is halfhearted, and the storyline’s shoddy writing and poor editing result in moments that lapse into the realm of near-laughable melodrama.
The movie’s trailer promises a thriller that will keep us on the edge of our seats. But audiences know from the movie’s gruesome and punchy inception how urgent the search for a cure is, so there is no room for escalating tensions over the subsequent 90 minutes of repetitive research. And since no character sticks around long enough for audiences to get attached to them, all of the film’s losses feel the same; though numbers of deaths escalate, our investment in the story does not. By the time Damon and his daughter find themselves literally running for their lives, we’re ready for the cure to be found, if only for some variation in the plot.
Moreover, the film seems to have something other than storytelling at its core. Sideways comments on the functioning and priorities of the Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and other such institutions, as well as references to the past wrongs of Wall Street and the chaos of Katrina, make the script more closely resemble a piece of propaganda rather than a work of cinematic storytelling.
Despite its substantial flaws, though, “Contagion” is still enjoyable. Its chilling progression makes for a coldly fatalistic statement about man’s helplessly infinitesimal place in the universe. Cliff Martinez’s effective score injects exciting energy to counter the sometimes-dragging plotline. And of course, heavy hitters like Winslet and Cotillard command the screen with their usual gravitas.
Still, with ingredients like a stellar cast, a talented writer, exotic locations, an Oscar-winning director, and a proven premise, this movie should have been capable of more than just holding its own. Yet it is difficult to lose ourselves in this story, absent compelling characters to engage our sympathies. From writing to directing, editing to acting—if all the players in “Contagion” had done their jobs with a little more of the potency of their past work, the film could have been truly spectacular.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the title of celebrated Belgian novelist Jean-Phillippe Toussaint’s latest novel, “The Truth About Marie,” little is revealed about the nameless protagonist—nor his love interest and ex-girlfriend, the titular Marie. This is not to say that Toussaint has abandoned his trademark impeccable imagery; his story alternates between lush and restrained styles, and between romantic and unnerving images. Through a wealth of evocative and detailed descriptions, rendered in English by Matthew B. Smith, Marie is revealed to be a capricious, self-involved sexpot, not unlike the staple female characters of French cinema. But when all is said and done, the novel that is left has a two-dimensional quality; there are no truths to be revealed about a woman who is utterly false. Toussaint makes no apologies for his emphasis of technique over plot, and indeed this is not where the problem lies. The uniquely stylized novel could be truly captivating if one cared about the characters he so devotionally describes. Despite a remarkable premise and a superb eye for detail, “The Truth About Marie” fails to invite a strong response.
This third novel of a loose trilogy is centered once again on Marie and the protagonist. Traveling between Paris, Tokyo, and Elba, he envisions Marie’s experiences with her new lover, Jean-Christophe d. G., an eminent elder statesman in French horse racing. Toussaint’s premise puts a noteworthy twist on the traditional style of the romance novel, focusing on a protagonist who is omniscient of his former love’s actions, due not to an inexplicable authorial whim, but instead to his intimate, seemingly limitless knowledge of Marie.
Toussaint’s love story is flecked with humor, which is most successful in its protagonist’s observations about his life. For instance, after sharing a brief moment of passion with Marie, he shamefully realizes that this is the second time he has fingered a woman this night; the previous participant was, ironically enough, also named Marie. However, most of Toussaint’s punchlines are based on nudity—which quickly grows tiresome—and Marie’s infinite quirks, such as her penchant for doffing her clothes, her lack of concern for others, and her complete inability to function in a crisis. She is a woman only a fictional man could love.
Toussaint’s measured tempo, which is at tantalizing at best and tedious at worst, requires patience but can pay off in spades. The story alternates between long stretches of calm and moments of intense action, with the author’s ability to dissect social interactions shining brightest in the latter. In a delightful but seemingly irrelevant plot twist, Jean-Christophe d. G’s horse Zahir escapes into the night, a moment that is described in striking prose. As his master searches for Zahir, “suddenly, charging out of nowhere, with the same unexpectedness as when he’d disappeared, Zahir’s black and powerful body materialized in the beam of the headlights, at once galloping and at rest, mad, his eyes gleaming with terror, his coat black and wet, as if suddenly defined against the night into which he had just moments before, dissolved.” 
When Toussaint loses his restraint, however, the tone can quickly turn sentimental. He brilliantly keeps the protagonist’s self-revelations to a minimum, so that information is only revealed about him through his interactions with Marie, emphasizing his obsession. As the protagonist gazes upon Marie, he reflects upon “[t]he hands and the eyes, the only two things that matter in life, in love, in art.”
The protagonist fulfills the lofty promise he makes at the end of the book, vowing to “reconstruct that night in mental images with the precision of dreams, I could cover it in word with a formidable power of evocation, all in vain, I knew I’d never reach what had been the fleeting life of night itself, but it seemed to me that I could perhaps reach a new truth, one that would take its inspiration from life and then transcend it, without concern for verisimilitude, or veracity, its only aim the quintessence of the real, its tender core, pulsing and vibrant, a truth closer to invention, the twin of fabrication, the ideal truth.” It is possible that the crux of the novel’s problem lies within its impeccable premise. As the protagonist is hopelessly in love with Marie, his imaginings of her experiences, although beautifully described by Toussaint, are immaterial. Their separation, though exhaustively narrated, is never explained; the reason as to their parting is left undiscussed. Touissant’s exquisite craft makes this shortcoming—the crucial lack of context—all the more frustrating. In the unsatisfying end, the protagonist manages to reunite with Marie, but without the slightest glimmer of knowledge as to why they separated in the first place, this triumphant conclusion turns into a pat one.

One pretty, young Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) living in 1966 East Berlin visits a doctor in hopes of discovering why she cannot conceive. This isn’t her first visit, and she remembers nervously fiddling with her silver necklace the last time she looked upon the kindly, paternal face of the gynecologist. So much rides on this appointment—more than even the doctor himself knows. A swift kick, a needle plunged into a throat, and the doctor—Dieter Vogel, Nazi war criminal (Jesper Christensen)—crashes to the floor in purple-faced glory. Singer summons an ambulance, a decoy driven by her two fellow Mossad agents, which will take the “surgeon of Birkenau” to Israel to stand trial for his crimes.
As is evident from scenes like these, “The Debt” is a stark departure from director John Madden’s well-known lighter films such as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown.”  The dark, taut film opens in 1997 Tel Aviv, where an older Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren) has gained acclaim for her role in the 1966 mission and in assassinating Vogel as he tried to escape while the agents waited for an opportunity to transport him out of the German Democratic Republic.  However, the Singer of 1997—along with her mission compatriots David Peretz (Ciáran Hinds) and Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson)—clearly bears the signs of emotional and physical distress. Singer’s cheek is marred with a hook-shaped scar from Vogel’s savage escape attempt, Gold is wheelchair-bound from a later encounter with a car bomb, and Peretz abruptly commits suicide by throwing himself in front of an oncoming truck not ten minutes into the film. Viewers are left to wonder: what really happened all those years ago to these three ostensible heroes? As the “The Debt” explores this very question in flashback, the suspense only heightens, and the film proves itself to be an aesthetically slick thriller with plot and performance that live up to the movie’s premise.
“The Debt” is first and foremost an action film. However, it deftly incorporates elements of other genres, and is thus partly psychological thriller, black comedy, gruesome horror, historical drama, and unrequited romance. Jesper Christensen as Vogel contributes much of the film’s darkness, crafting a morbidly captivating antagonist who simultaneously embraces and brushes away his Nazi identity. His crackling blue gaze unnerves the three young agents who capture him, evoking nightmares in Singer, cruelty in the aggressive Gold (Marton Csokas), and vengeful bloodlust in the otherwise reserved Peretz (Sam Worthington). When Vogel spits in the face of Peretz and goads him with the riposte “you Jews never knew how to kill, only how to die,” we witness a rare instance of authentic, unadorned cinematic villainy.
The environment of the film also contributes to its compelling claustrophobia. Much of the movie takes place in the East Berlin apartment where the agents detain Vogel while holding out for extraction. As the wait drags on, their apartment becomes a reflection of their increasingly unstable psyches, with water dripping from the dilapidated ceiling and cockroaches crawling around madly in the sink.
While these psychological horror aspects of “The Debt” comprise its greatest strength, it is ironically the film’s romantic element that comprises its weakness, despite Madden’s prior success in this area, most notably with “Shakespeare in Love.” While Singer is supposed to be in love with Peretz, at least as telegraphed by the film’s screenplay, Worthington projects such an emotionally closed-off character that it’s difficult to be sympathetic to his feelings when Singer ends up pairing off with the more assertive Gold.
Fortunately, the film doesn’t need romance to enhance its pulse-pounding plot, and well-placed dark humor provides brief respites from the constant mental angst of the agents. Whether it is Gold plinking away at the apartment’s piano, bitterly singing “Deutschland über Alles” in front of Vogel, or the trio talking wistfully about their life goals in a German bar, “The Debt” is careful to balance plot with personality, and never to overwhelm the viewer with action or revelation except when absolutely necessary.
Overall, “The Debt” wears many hats, and to describe it merely as an “action thriller” would be an injustice. Each prop, setting, and facial expression is mirrored in another part of the film and not a minute is wasted on superfluous fighting or fiery explosions. When an item is featured, it returns ten minutes or even an hour later with deeper meaning, an exquisite narrative effect that rewards multiple viewings. And ultimately, it is a testament to the tight writing of “The Debt” that anything more about its plot or the true nature of the three agents’ personal “debt” is best said by the film itself.

The explosive opening scene of Bellflower gives the immediate sense that someone has locked the doors and thrown away the key, leaving no place to hide. The audience is forewarned: this is not a cinematic experience for the faint of heart. As one fleeting caption cautions, “nobody gets out of here alive”—the viewer not excluded. For in Evan Glodell’s new film, the “here” is not some Hollywood movie set but the inner recesses of human consciousness.
Likened to “Fight Club” and “Mad Max,” Bellflower ambitiously tests the limits of man-made destruction, loss, friendship, and power while it treats the pitiably mundane and trite. Ostensibly, the story is about two boys without prospects or purpose, except that of world domination. Convinced that apocalyptic doom is bound to strike someday, they resolve to prepare themselves by developing the world’s deadliest weapons in the hopes of inheriting the vast wasteland. Little do they know that tragedy will hit a lot closer to home.
Woodrow (Evan Glodell) and his friend Aiden (Tyler Dawson) would be top assassins if they were not so busy making such a mess of their own lives. These characters are more fearsome for their flawed humanity than their perfected criminality. Far from killing machines, they are awkward, disillusioned teenagers desperate for a thrill. Underneath their cloak and dagger smokescreen resides a raw sentimentality and acute insecurity that are both equally unnerving. One doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the helplessness of these characters. How could such incompetency manage any of the great feats of power to which the duo aspires? Then again, Woodrow and Aiden are portrayed to be just clueless enough to set the world on fire.
Through the artful juxtaposition and interplay of disparate shots, Glodell successfully underscores the tragi-comic effect of his protagonists’ unpredictable double life. At one moment, the best friends discuss their women while assembling explosives; in another, they talk shop while casually scrambling eggs; in a third, they blow up a scarecrow then hit the beach. As if this was not jarring enough, the director plays recklessly with the color wheel to inflame the background in electrifying orange and blue hues, creating a disorienting solar effect. Just like their alter egos on the screen, Glodell and his right-hand man, photographer Joel Hodge, crafted their own tools, building hand-made cameras exclusively for shooting ”Bellflower,” and using them throughout the film to great artistic effect.
On the screenplay end—also by Glodell—the dialogue between Woodrow and his girlfriend Milly (Jessie Wiseman) is so raw and bare, we get the feeling that we are watching them gaff and guffaw in real life. Sure they do odd things like drive to Texas on a whim, buy a motorcycle, get wasted and cuss like truckers, but they are ultimately driven by naked fears, hopes, and desires. In one of the few quiet scenes of the movie, the two are snuggling when one of them feels the need to establish, “you are not going to hurt me,” to which the other simply replies, “okay.” Their interactions are that simple and innocent and yet the whole order of their lives hangs in the balance of such a conversation. For implied in their exchange is the realization that all the two lovers need is themselves—not explosives or flamethrowers or alcohol or machine guns—to cause each other infinite pain and regret.
This small but powerful movie, selected for this year’s Sundance Festival, shows viewers the path of destruction created by apocalyptic fire only to send them burrowing back into the human psyche, where a hollowness carved by silence, regret, vengeance, and longing combusts to create the unthinkable. One of Aiden’s more memorable lines could just as easily be applied to “Bellflower” itself: “No, dude, it wasn’t awesome, it was terrible. Super awkward. Nobody knew what to say and then we all started fucking crying.”
The movie has opened in limited release, and it is well worth seeking out a theater in which it is playing. Just forget the tissues—bring a protective shield.

As the curtain rises, the audience is greeted by grimy brick walls, cracked pipes, and a handful of ragged individuals huddled together on the street trying in vain to elicit some act of charity from apathetic passers-by. This is Alphabet City on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the setting for Jonathan Larson’s hit musical “Rent,” recreated in Boston’s New Repertory Theatre until September 25. Director Benjamin Evett and a strong ensemble make an admirable attempt to tell Larson’s story of love in the midst of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, but the production is overrun by technical issues that threaten to undermine the show’s strengths.
“Rent” follows the lives of a group of impoverished artists struggling to survive and create in bohemian Alphabet City, all while coping with the HIV/AIDS pandemic rapidly taking over the streets of New York. Roger (Robert St. Laurence), an HIV-positive musician, falls in love with Mimi (Eve Kagan) a club dancer with a debilitating heroin habit who shares his disease. Tom (Maurice Parent), a gay anarchist with AIDS, explores a relationship with Angel (Nick Sulfaro), a young drag queen who strives to remain optimistic about his experience with the disease. The interplay within the group is filmed and narrated by Roger’s roommate Mark (John Ambrosino), who hides behind his camera to avoid any emotional involvement. The premise of the musical is rife with potential to make many different emotions tangible for the audience, but the production suffers from a number of crippling setbacks that stunt the show’s emotional development.
The rock musical’s hard-hitting ballads are overshadowed by a flurry of missed lyrics and technical issues. An enormously distracting dose of microphone feedback hangs in the air throughout the show, and worsens during the musical numbers’ vocal peaks. The louder songs are not the only elements of the show that are marred by technical issues. The performance’s softer moments are overpowered by the onstage orchestra, which renders the more hushed vocals almost inaudible.
St. Laurence’s performance as Roger is almost as disastrous as the sound blunders. Between botched lyrics, weak vocals, and moments of blatant overacting, the audience is left to digest a rather uninspiring performance from one of the musical’s most recognizable characters. Roger is one of the stronger male characters—brooding and complex, often with a soulful tenor voice to match—but St. Laurence fails to animate any such profundity in his performance.
These missteps are lamentable, simply because many of the musical numbers are nothing short of brilliant. The ensemble’s interpretation of “Seasons of Love”—complete with a montage featuring the names of some of the victims of the HIV/AIDS virus—is heartfelt and sincere. Aimee Doherty’s reinvention of the free-sprited Maureen’s iconic “Over the Moon,” in which she attempts to save the group’s performance space from destruction, is charmingly quirky, while the ensemble bursts with contagious energy in “La Vie Boheme.” On an individual level, Ambrosino’s endearing antics and clear, steady voice seem to right the struggling performance whenever it falters.
The space in which they are acting bolsters the group’s performance. The stage itself is small, and dozens of cast members navigate it in elaborate patterns to avoid colliding with one another—a daring artistic decision in an ensemble piece, but one which effectively imitates the crowded streets of New York.
The continuing popularity of “Rent” stems from dual causes: the musical both subverts prevalent social mores and touches on issues—death, love, and addiction—that people can connect to on an emotional level. Although the company makes a valiant effort, foundational issues—much like the devastating virus at the heart of the production—corrupt what could otherwise be a powerful performance.

“I will shout until they know what I mean!” Not only did singer Jeff Mangum pen these words for Neutral Milk Hotel’s song “The King of Carrot Flowers Part 3,” he did exactly that last Friday night in a concert that filled Sanders Theatre to capacity. Although Mangum’s songs are not regarded as easily accessible—what with his unique voice and love of confusing narratives—his artistry leaves listeners hanging on his every word. In his Friday concert, Mangum transfixed listeners in the same venue where students had attended Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” lecture hours before. Except for the slightly higher-than-usual proportion of flannel shirts, it looked like any large Harvard lecture—that is, until Jeff Mangum walked on stage and brought forth an atmosphere of hero-worship that lasted far after his set concluded.
Jeff Mangum’s solo appearance at Sanders Theatre was hardly a typical occurrence for the alternative music scene. The show marked Mangum’s first major performance in more than a decade since the 1998 release of Neutral Milk Hotel’s critically acclaimed second album, “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.” More than a simple collection of songs, the band’s album is a convoluted narrative of young love, a two-headed boy, and Anne Frank set to unconventional instrumentation—most notably a frequent use of singing saws. “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea” remains the band’s last release, for Mangum—citing an inability to live up to the idolization of his fans—withdrew from the public eye shortly after the release. For years, he lived as a kind of recluse, leaving the world of performing indefinitely. However, as his Sanders performance can attest, Mangum has returned.
As soon as he took the stage, Mangum launched into a rendition of “Oh Comely,” an eight-minute stream-of-consciousness account of unrequited love both highly cryptic and graphically sexual. Though Mangum lacked his backing band, his solo reinterpretation was even more intimate and spellbinding than the recorded version. He carried a feeling of closeness and connection throughout the show, the magical atmosphere captured best when the entire theater burst into song, perfectly regurgitating Mangum’s bizarre and often cumbersome lyrics. It was certainly strange to hear a resounding chorus of phrases like “And your mom would stick a fork right into Daddy’s shoulder / and Dad would throw the garbage all across the floor / as we would lay and learn what each other’s bodies were for” in Sanders’ cavernous hall.
Mangum’s performance was filled with endearingly awkward, raw moments—a reflection of the earnest and personal nature of Neutral Milk Hotel’s albums. During “A Baby for Pree,” a track off their debut, “On Avery Island,” the sound system in Sanders Theater lost function. However, far from deterring Mangum on his acoustic guitar, the malfunction enlivened Mangum’s spirit: in his devotion for his fans, he kneeled at the very front of his stage, never pausing on his guitar. Later on, during a brief pause in Mangum’s almost continuous performance, he shouted, “I think I could die happy too,” by way of reply to a fan who had presumably said something to that effect.
Mangum concluded his set to a standing ovation that continued minutes past his brief, one-song encore. When the applause prompted a second encore, Mangum emerged once more to give a hushed, un-amplified performance of “Two-Headed Boy”—a song about a Siamese twin’s love for Anne Frank—as a parting gift. Perhaps the oddity of Mangum’s lyrics is part of his allure: with only a funny hat and four guitars, he broke a decade of silence and commanded Sanders’ stage with unmatched authority.

A line of posts wreathed in red flowers cut across Harvard Yard last Sunday. On each was a poem reflecting on the event of ten years ago. An excerpt from Martín Espada’s “Alabanza: In Praise of Local 100” reads, “When the war began, from Manhattan to Kabul / two constellations of smoke rose and drifted to each other, / mingling in icy air, and one said with an Afghan tongue: / Teach me to dance. We have no music here. /And the other said with a Spanish tongue: / I will teach you. Music is all we have.” The poem was dedicated to 43 employees, many of them immigrants, who lost their lives while they at work at the Window on the World restaurant on the top floors of the World Trade Center’s North Tower.
These poem pillars were part of the Mahindra Humanities Center’s September 11 memorial—a tribute that culminated in a reflective performance in Sanders Theater. Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha described the artwork’s intent:  “I wanted to create a sense of community that was aware [that] the dangers which afflict the world today cannot be combatted without people working in solidarity … [and] people considering the common survival of the human race irrespective of race or country or class.” The intent of the memorial, nestled as it was in Harvard’s multinational campus, was to encourage serious reflection through a different means than others offered on campus. Executive Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Steven Biel said that the purpose of the outdoor poem pillars and performance was “not just to focus on the events of that day, but to look back at the ten succeeding years.” He noted that the Mahindra Center’s intention was “not make this an academic event”—as it was felt that there would be no shortage of discussion on campus already. Rather, the center wanted to express that “out of the fires of destruction, great art, great culture can emerge,” Bhabha said. The memorial’s intent was to use this artwork to pursue meaning in solidarity.
Sanders Theater was filled to capacity on Sunday afternoon for “The Art of Survival: A 10th Anniversary Observance of 9/11 in Words, Music, and Dance”, a performance sponsored by the Mahindra Humanities Center and the Office of the President. The memorial began with a presentation of photographs taken from the aftermath of September 11—among them images of a fire smoldering in front of the ruined towers, a fireman standing in rubble and holding up his hands, a family holding a vigil, a New York skyline lit up with two white searchlights where the towers would have stood today, and a woman wearing a hijab at a candlelit memorial. As the photographs were shown, a woman recited a poem by Toni Morrison titled “Whose House is This?” It discussed a sense of being estranged from one’s own home: “The House is strange. Its shadows lie. Say, tell me, why does its lock fit my key?” Morrison’s poem reflects Bhabha’s  thoughts: “What happened on 9/11, what happened on Madrid on 7/11—what happened on these days was that people woke up expecting a perfectly ordinary day … and suddenly, the world became dark. You were in your home, but you could not recognize it.”
This idea of ordinary life being darkened resonated through the memorial, carried through by spoken word, musical pieces, and an original performance by Harvard Dance Director Jill Johnson and Harvard student dancers. The opening display of photographs was complemented by a series of readings which included transcripts from inteviews with World Trade Center rescue workers and letters from American soldiers in Iraq. These readings echoed the theme of how ordinary life can be and was so terribly shattered—not simply in the immediate wake of September 11, but, as a reading from an Iraqi blog expressed, in the violence that Iraqis still suffer “on a monthly basis.” A transcript from a New York E.M.T on the morning of the attack finished with the terrible question, “What just happened?” The eloquent letter of one American soldier written shortly before his death expressed how much healing remains for those still fighting in the War on Terror, in lands where terrorists and innocent civilians live in close conflict. Spoken aloud during the performance, the soldier’s letter revealed   bitterness, and of hope for a clearer solution: “I can only hope that God forgives us for the way we treat these people.”
Woven together, the voices, music, and dance were united by their common sense of loss and estrangement, a sorrow that one reader at the perfomance described as a “plunge of consciousness into a ground zero of anxiety.” The myriad artistic pieces reflect the unity of its audience: “Solidarity is like a patchwork or a mosaic—different pieces are differently colored, different shapes—and yet they hold together,” Bhabha said. What brought solidarity to last Sunday’s performance, perhaps, was each piece’s reflection on the beauty that is lost when ordinary life is shattered—and the realization again of that beauty as mourners found solace in the art, and in each other.

Deborah Martin Kao serves as the Chief Curator of the Harvard Art Museums during a time of great change—with the anticipated opening of the Fogg Museum in 2013, the university’s art museums are currently undergoing a renovation that may change their very role at Harvard. Kao recently spoke to the Harvard Crimson about her job, the Fogg renovation, and some of her favorite pieces in Harvard’s collection.
The Harvard Crimson: Before you became the Chief Curator of the Harvard Art Museums, you worked in several curatorial positions in Harvard’s photography department.  How does the position of Chief Curator differ from these jobs?
Deborah Martin Kao: I’m still involved in the photography department, but the biggest difference is being immersed solely in your area of expertise versus taking a more global view. It has been fascinating for me these past couple of years to get to understand the full range of my colleagues’ work in the institution. It is really a matter of taking a different vantage point.
THC: How do you think the Harvard Art Museums are changing at this point in time, especially with regards to the Fogg renovation?
DBK: I’m almost tempted to ask in what way aren’t we changing. It is really an extraordinary, once-in-a-career opportunity to be part of an institution that is undergoing the kind of dramatic change that the Harvard Art Museums are undergoing. We have a lot of ambitious and overarching goals, but I think primary among them is a desire to create a museum for the 21st  century, one that is fully integrated with the curricular ambitions of the university.  We [also] want to create a range of new kinds of spaces where teaching and learning can take place. [This] is a unique opportunity that you have in a museum; [creating spaces] is different than seeing a projection of the work in a PowerPoint presentation or a streaming of it on the Internet.
THC: You have spoken a bit about the intersection between the curriculum and the art museums.  Do you think Harvard students are taking advantage of the resources they have in these museums?
DBK: It is an excellent question, but in a funny way it is a hard question to answer because part of it depends on the way art museums have been used in the past. What we see today is a [renewed] interest in the use of the museum for a broad range of interests. You can see an example of that in the exhibition that we have installed right now, “The Print and the Pursuit of Knowledge,” which is all about the intersection of science and art in the 16th century. This was the brainchild of our print curator [Susan M. Dackerman]—but in collaboration with [History of Science Professor Katharine Park], it also featured the thorough participation of students.  Over 15 students actually wrote for the [exhibit’s] catalogue.  In some ways, you could see that exhibition as a kind of model for where we want the larger institution to be by the time we reopen. It is about making sure that, from soup to nuts, all of the programs we do are connected with opportunities for learning, exchange, and collaboration with undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, [and] visiting fellows.
THC: With that in mind, where do you see the Harvard Art Museums in ten years?
DBK: I think that our vision for ten years is the same as our vision for reopening. It is about an institution that is fully integrated in the curricular life of the university and participates in the need for the arts at Harvard to be relevant and important to the cognitive life of our students.
THC: Could you share with us some of your favorite pieces of art in the Harvard Art Museums?
DBK: Some of my favorite works in the collection are the very early photographs.  There is a wonderful full plate daguerreotype portrait of John Collins Warren, a 19th century Harvard surgeon who was involved in the earliest use of anesthesia.  The portrait itself is so sensitive—you feel as if you can almost read, etched on this man’s face, that experience of having been a physician before the age of ether, and what that must have meant.  There is a way in which early photographic portraiture can see into the soul in a way that must have been incredibly affecting for people of its time.  For me, it still holds that.
THC: What is your favorite part of being Chief Curator?
DBK: It is really about having the chance to work so closely with all of my colleagues across disciplines in this collaborative exercise of reinvention that we have engaged in with [Thomas W. Lentz], our director.  It is a privilege.

Everything about Annie Clark, who performs under the name St. Vincent, seems at odds with itself. The singer-songwriter, a wide-eyed, demure-looking Oklahoman, first shattered any image of innocence and one-dimensionality with her 2007 debut “Marry Me.” With lyrics teetering between the outlandish and the soulful, St. Vincent combined her voice with an eclectic mix of instruments to show that her demeanor belied the dark complexity within. After four years and two critically acclaimed albums, St. Vincent has expanded her sonic range through a complex combination of increasingly oblique lyrics, bizarre instrumentation, and irregular song structures. “Strange Mercy” continues to broaden her already experimental style and, though superficially inaccessible, the album is the most successful expression of her sound yet.
This is not a welcoming album. The opening song “Chloe in the Afternoon” sets the overall tone of the album with its immediate blend of woozy synthesizers, spasmodic bursts of guitar, and incongruously dulcet vocals. From there, the album blossoms into a complex and often confusing work comprised of lurching transitions and unanticipated explosions of noise. Her lyrical choices do nothing to contradict this aesthetic. Though the album’s abrasiveness and rapid tonal shifts from sweet simplicity to furious madness challenge her listeners, her care in assembling these seemingly unhinged tracks is exercised with striking precision.
Perhaps the best aspects of “Strange Mercy” are not simply St. Vincent’s expertly varied and calculated combinations of standard instruments and voice, but also her increased and unexpected use of synthesizer. With a gently beating drum or a soft pluck of guitar string, the calm, secure tones of “Marry Me” and second album “Actor” are invoked. However, the retro synthesized sounds one would expect from Passion Pit or MGMT somehow find their way between slow bass thrums and an alto voice. It is this sort of unpredictability that leads the songs’ artful progression and overall ingenuity. Surprising, lip-curling guitar riffs jar and blend with soft vocals, while distorted synthesized sounds join in a mélange of chaos. Clark pushes each instrument to its most extreme range, confidently shifting the music from calm to hysteria, ease to madness. This Pandora’s box of instrumentation contains as much ear-splitting noise as it does traditional guitar, yet these ordinarily abrasive sounds are deployed with such exactness that the unholy becomes otherwise.
Whether in the opening sequence of “Hysterical Strength” or the middle of “Neutered Fruit,” St. Vincent’s jarring synth and electric guitar measures enhance her quirky and understated lyrics. The line “I ate flowers in the backyard / While finding neutered fruit” would sound irredeemably strange and perverse were it not resting on top of her characteristic hypnotic, slightly neurotic bass guitar pulse. There is, in the same song, the line “Don’t run, don’t run / Little rabbit, run,” which is then evoked by a lightly distorted electric guitar passage that mimics the forbidden action. St. Vincent’s instrumentals work well with her vocals, musically miming her lyrics and lending undercurrents of meaning to purposefully vague passages.
Though she is a self-proclaimed killer of poetry, St. Vincent isn’t so much killing poetry as she is creating her own particular brand. Instead of delivering them in voice, “Strange Mercy” delivers them in the more unconventional mode of instrumentation. This album relies on a close connection between eerily subdued lyrics and dynamic melodies, propagating an artful strangeness that thrives along insane lines, and adheres to its own aesthetic logic. St. Vincent’s method is truly impressive, and on “Strange Mercy” her beautiful combination of complex words and aggressively bizarre sounds has come even closer to the sublime.

“Winter is where she abides all the while / Her hillsides are covered in snow,” Blitzen Trapper’s aptly named vocalist Eric Earley sings in “Girl in a Coat,” the sixth track on the band’s new album “American Goldwing.” As the weather is beginning to change and images of snow-covered hills are soon to become a defining feature of the landscape, “American Goldwing,” has perhaps missed a more appropriate release date. Nonetheless, for an album of this quality, a late arrival is better than none at all.
“American Goldwing” is decidedly Americana, and it hovers between the boundaries of classic rock and folk, telling familiar tales with a touch of western twang. Despite its traditionalist bent, “American Goldwing” is surprisingly diverse. When up-tempo, its pulsing, classic rock–inspired guitar riffs, driving drumbeats, and underpinning bass lines wind their way through each song’s varying yet cohesive sections. When mellow, its picked-out guitar melodies and gentle vocals come across with spare clarity. Part beer-and-barbecue Americana and part musical achievement, the album straddles the line between simplicity and complexity, and builds surprisingly nuanced songs out of relatively standard components. What emerges is a rare breed of album both catchy and awe inspiring that layman and connoisseur alike can appreciate.
That the members of Blitzen Trapper are talented musicians is clear from the outset. Yet while they have the potential for extreme musical sophistication, they mostly refrain and instead put their effort into the subtleties that make good, familiar songs into great ones. The most successful passages on “American Goldwing” are marked by a clean clarity. One brilliant moment comes in a transition about halfway through the album’s third track, “Love the Way You Walk Away.” The drummer cuts the chorus with a cymbal crash, trading a steady kick for an equally simple four-four beat that underlies a basic banjo melody. A slide guitar wanders in the periphery, while a two-part harmony coasts atop everything. This nuanced layering gives otherwise unremarkable parts the depth to be musically interesting while still remaining comprehensible.
Simplicity does not mean a lack of skill, however. Blitzen Trapper is capable of masking even their more convoluted musical ideas with the appearance of ease. Within the album, there is cohesion, brevity, and, perhaps most importantly, space. Bltizen Trapper knows equally well the power of musical expression and the restraint that allows it to flourish. Toward the end of the first track, “Might Find It Cheap,” as the chorus comes to a close, the guitarist interrupts his regular strumming, leaving space on the fourth beat. At the same time, the drummer curtails his regular beat by one note, expanding the rest and creating the effect of a hiccup that then drops into a strong chord and quick, punchy guitar line. While these subtle specifics may go unnoticed, they create an unmistakable tension and resolve that take place within the span of a few seconds. It is small details like these that keep the record musically impressive without eliminating the nostalgic  power of their songs.
The album is primarily about clean, understandable music. Through instrumentation and song structures similar to those of classic rock giants like Kansas and lyrics that operate in common narrative and descriptive motifs—hometowns, lost loves, the words ‘American’, ‘gold’, and ‘wing’—Blitzen Trapper imbues its music with familiar comfort. What makes this album powerful is the subtlety and careful construction behind its sound.
After beginning in cacophonous noise and progressing through a series of upbeat, touching, relaxed, and catchy tunes, “American Goldwing” closes with a sentimentally slow harmonica, guitar, and piano backing to Earley singing softly, “When I’m gone you’ll know me by the friends I leave behind.” As Blitzen Trapper ends its album, it leaves behind a moment of musical eloquence, and a familiar sound brought back alive once again.

Heartbreak ballads and lovesick songs are normally alternative-rock, but not so much the psychedelic music scene. Yet Neon Indian, the stage name for Alan Palomo, manages to recount a classic break-up story in his ultra hip “Era Extraña,” roughly translated as “it was weird.” The album is split into three main phases, each marked by an introductory instrumental track. “Heart: Attack,” in the first stage, expresses his denial and frustration; “Heart: Decay” signals a period of depression; and the third phase, one of acceptance, culminates in “Heart: Release.”
The album’s plot is its least strange aspect, as Palomo reaches past the boundaries of the psychedelic genre to blend his chillwave sensibilities with pop and punk. By executing his vision, he creates a complex and cohesive soundscape over which he narrates his story. Though at times repetitive, the album is a compelling innovation in a somewhat staid genre.
Palomo blends elements of pop and punk into each track, fostering different environments in which to tell his story. On “Polish Girl,” perhaps the catchiest track of the album, Palomo balances accessibility and psychedelic artistry while reminiscing about the emotional baggage of an unresolved break-up. Electronic glissandos add complexity to the recurring four-beat Nintendo-like melody, the whisper of a guitar run through a wah-wah pedal, and the steady drum line. The result is a rich, upbeat ambiance. The steady repetition of distorted power chords and addition of whispered chanting on “The Blindside Kiss” offers a heavier, punk rock–influenced tone. Although the combination is initially surprising, he balances the punk and melodic electronica genres well between verses and choruses. However, at times, and especially on “Hex Girlfriend,” Palomo fails to emphasize appropriate parts of the instrumentation, and his aural landscapes become overly cluttered.
The instrumentation isn’t the only fluid aspect of the album: Palomo employs different vocal styles to convey more effectively the emotions his narrative invokes. In the earlier tracks, Palomo’s voice has a bittersweet and somewhat urgent air. In the more classic 80s psychedelic “Fall Out,” he manages to retain his chillwave style while successfully presenting the listless emotions associated with the period after a break-up. Supported by a slower tempo and lower tones in the melody, Palomo uses a solemn bass voice instead of his usual whisper falsetto as he sings, it’s about “fall[ing] out of love with you.” Then, transitioning to the third phase of the album, Palomo begins to surface with a more settled and tranquil tone as heard on “Halogen (I Could Be A Shadow)” and “Suns Irrupt.”
Though one of the album’s strengths is its overarching narrative, the conclusion leaves much to be desired. “Heart: Release” as the final track of the album is calming after the chaos of “Suns Irrupt,” but fails to properly conclude the story. The bass guitar leads the song, and builds up expectation only to let the song fade abruptly, unresolved. Perhaps Palomo intended the album to be a cliffhanger as the protagonist moves onto the next chapter of his life, but in light of the otherwise complete story, the finish is disorienting and disappointing.
In spite of these slight flaws, Palomo artfully crafts the complete saga of his break-up through an innovative combination of genres that makes his music accessible to fans of general electronica and even more straightforward pop. In “Era Extraña,” Palomo has demonstrated the beginnings of his creative potential and perhaps even begun the integration of other genres into the chillwave scene.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: SEPT. 14, 2011
The Sept. 13 article "Neon Indian Brings the Break-Up Album to Chillwave" mistranslated the album's title as "strange era." A more accurate translation is "it was weird."

Cymbals Eat Guitars’ 2009 debut “Why There Are Mountains” was an indulgent patchwork of indie rock tropes—equal parts Arcade Fire’s chamber-pop pretensions, glam’s shiny haze, and Pavement’s quirky bitterness. The New York quartet begins its sophomore release “Lenses Alien” with the same mélange of garage-rock chords and glockenspiel tingles, but within minutes, opening track “Rifle Eyesight (Proper Name)” becomes the album’s densest noise-rock jam. Though it feels predominantly like an aggressive attempt to place distance between “Lenses Alien” and the band’s previous work, it also signals what is to come: with a stark instrumental palette and a penchant for cultivating restlessness, “Lenses Alien” binds together chaos and cohesiveness in a brilliantly charged opus.
The album runs wild with variation. The opening track continues from its thunderous jam into punchy noise pop, funereal piano chords, and, finally, an anthemic stomp. Tempo and tone shift ceaselessly on all the tracks. Some also touch lightly on the hallmarks of other styles, like the piano theme of “Secret Family,” which is reminiscent of Springsteen. The band eschews traditional song structures and conventions, and their stylistic dares range from opening songs with their most climactic strokes to introduce lyrics in only the last 30 seconds—as on the beautiful “The Current.” Of course, even that rule has its exceptions: the comparatively stable riff-chorus structures in “Shore Points” and “Wavelengths” almost create false senses of security between the bursts of anarchy.
But the band works most effectively on a smaller scale, as they almost constantly alter every instrumental line. Frontman Joseph D’Agostino often shifts his guitar melodies every few measures, re-sequencing the riffs’ notes or subbing in new high ones; drummer Matthew Miller continuously tweaks his beats, and he often reinterprets them in stellar drum fills. The complexity makes every track feel like a living and mutating composition, and the restless, incessant alterations breed anticipation that lingers over even the album’s slower passages.
The band unifies the album’s structural diversity in an instrumental palette of echoing lo-fi guitar, drums, smooth bass, and occasional soft piano. That common sound creates strong cohesiveness across the album, but also a pleasantly simple tone. Yet that simplicity also facilitates the album’s complexity—with such uncluttered tracks, the constant subtle shifts of each instrument become all the more perceptible. The intersection of restraint and exploration is the greatest triumph of “Lenses Alien”—the band’s ability to unravel fluidly infinite variations out of the same limited components, and to balance conflicting tones.
D’Agostino’s guitar landscapes dominate the album, and despite the occasional forays out of his genre, he mostly works in two styles: cyclical high-low patterns reminiscent of Robert Smith and Peter Buck and scraping garage-rock chords like J Mascis. His itinerant melodies’ hypnotic shifts leave little place for catchy hooks, and that lack actually aids the album’s feel—with nearly no hooks to anchor it, the album’s momentum continues in freefall, swiftly but securely.
The album’s lyrics embody a tension between the predictable and the unstable—in content as well as accessibility. D’Agostino threatens simple, grounded suburban imagery with artfully drawn cosmic speculations and touches of Lovecraftian terror, as when he sings “the roads, they are parabolas with nameless water towers near the exits / You turn it all on end and it still wouldn’t be taller than the biotic arch / At the crown of creation,” on “Definite Darkness.” But too often, he seems to focus more on singing passionately than on keeping his words comprehensible. Though it works, in a way—the intelligible lines establish the suburban and cosmic motifs, while the others’ elusiveness further defies coherence and stability—more comprehensible lyrics could have deepened and complicated the already lush album.
The group builds the record’s self-contrasting dynamic right through the end of the last track. D’Agostino releases his most fearsome scream at the end of closing track “Gary Condit,” a nails-on-chalkboard climax to the album’s manic energy. Then he abruptly cuts it off without so much as an echo, and the album ends immediately. Neither the chaos nor control held tightly in balance throughout finally claims the album, and the drama of that final clash embodies the duality that makes “Lenses Alien” one of the year’s most powerful releases.

The fiction of Franz Kafka, a German-language novelist, is unavoidably ambiguous. Nameless castles, haunting phantasms, guilt, and the ever watchful eye of ubiquitous authority collide in works that rarely provide the reader with anything conclusive; some never even conclude. “A reader’s capacity to dispose of and synthesize contradictions is a valuable skill in reading Kafka, as there is in fact no unequivocal understanding,” writes Swiss visual artist Pavel Schmidt in an email interview. On September 13, the Sert Gallery of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts will open its doors to reveal the exhibition “Pavel Schmidt: Franz Kafka—Verschrieben & Verzeichnet,” a series of 49 sketches by Pavel Schmidt that investigate the problematic relation between Kafka’s texts and reality. The exhibition embraces Kafka in all his frustrating duality, arguing that the human mind, not just the human Kafka, distorts reality in unexpected ways.
Each of the sketches is identically laid out: a gold frame bears the neatly printed name of a character from Kafka’s life or work at the top and a brief excerpt from Kafka’s journals, letters, or stories at the bottom. Resting inbetween is a large, abstract sketch—which incorporates a wide range of different materials, including oil paints, ink, and resin—somehow related to the text and the character. The resulting textural variation contributes to the complexity of the representations, but it’s apparent that Schmidt wants the effect to be primarily visceral. “There will be no placards reading ‘oil on canvas’ in this exhibition,” says Carpenter Center exhibitions manager Edward J. Lloyd.
In other hands, such a straightforward pairing between text and image could have disintegrated into a veritable Kafka for kids, with the visual component clearly demonstrating the character and the text. Instead, Pavel Schmidt eschews the demonstrative for a relation between text and image that can only be described as Kafkaesque. A shifting and often ambiguous relationship, it forces the viewer to accept contradiction and uncertainty as an inevitable component of understanding.
The German title “Verschrieben & Verzeichnet” reveals the conceptual framework of these sketches upon close consideration. “‘Verzeichnen’ [the verb behind ‘verzeichnet’] means to record a thing, to write it down, to list it, to register it, but the prefix ‘ver-’ in German always has a distorting or perverting quality to it,” says Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature John Hamilton. “Therefore, ‘verzeichnen’ can mean ‘to misrepresent’ as well.” Hamilton, who played a large part in getting Schmidt’s exhibition to Harvard, describes the exhibit as a collision between these two contradictory elements of human representative faculties. On the one hand, Schmidt’s sketches are in some way expected to explicate the text that accompanies them, but on the other, they come between the viewer and the text, in essence imposing a particular interpretation on something inherently ambiguous. “Schmidt is about collision, about putting word and image in close contact, so that the two fight with each other,” Hamilton says.
Like the direct pairing between word and image, the sketches themselves gesture toward convention and tantalize perceptual expectations but refuse to embrace anything solid and certain. Each sketch bears a superficial resemblance to traditional portraiture, with a shoulder-like foundation grounding each figure, and eventually narrowing up to what might be identified as a head-like appendage. However, the shaky and exuberant forms that lie inbetween often resemble pieces of coral more than the human face, so each ‘portrait’ of a character exists in an unsettling limbo between human, animal, vegetable, and mineral. Just as Kafka revealed the cracks and chasms in the ostensibly stable character of Gregor Samsa by transforming him into a giant insect in his short story “The Metamorphosis,” Schmidt communicates a deep and visceral understanding of his subjects by representing them as distinct species of fantastic organisms comprehensible only within an entirely new taxonomy. For instance, Kafka’s father, Hermann Kafka, is represented as an imposing tower of thick red concentric arcs, a moody shape that seems to disapprove of the viewer even without facial features.
Though a tour through the exhibition might feel like flipping through the Audubon guide to Mars, the Carpenter Center faculty has made sure that no viewer enters the exhibition without some entry point into the confounding material. On September 29, a panel consisting of Kafka scholars and Pavel Schmidt himself will discuss the exhibition and how it relates to the questions raised by Kafka’s oeuvre. “I thought it would be nice to stage a collision,” says Hamilton, “to have scholarship collide with art.” In addition, a program of biographical details about each individual or character will accompany the exhibition, so no one requires an exhaustive knowledge of Kafka’s life and work to enter. Regardless of one’s familiarity, Schmidt’s exhibit continues to confound—but, he might argue, such is life.

With the exception of the giant bronze rhinoceros standing guard in the courtyard, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA) has a more humble exterior than its grander and better-known neighbour, the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA). Founded in 1876 as the educational arm of the MFA, the school is currently displaying the work of eight different contemporary Mexican artists in the exhibition “Disponible: A Kind of Mexican Show,” which runs until November 19. Meaning at once “available,” “changeable,” and “disposable,” the title “Disponible” comes from the vacant advertisement billboards that dot the cityscape of Mexico City.
“Disponible” was first exhibited at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) in late 2010 to mark the bicentennial of Mexican independence and the centennial of the republican revolution which overthrew long-time autocrat Porfirio Díaz. The exhibit engages with the effects of globalization on postcolonial Mexico’s workforce. Heavy though this artistic agenda may seem, exuberance defines the show’s atmosphere.
The walls of the Barbara and Steven Grossman Gallery, which houses most of exhibition’s artwork, are painted lime green, eggplant purple, and bright orange—all typical Mexican colors. “This is to show it isn’t about New England,” says Joanna Soltan, the curator of the exhibition. Yet aside from providing a distinctly Mexican ambiance, color does not play a large role in most of the pieces exhibited. It is only in “White Noise” by Héctor Zamora that color is particularly significant. The work originally consisted of 500 white flags placed by members of the public on a beach in New Zealand, where the installation was first shown. The color white symbolizes protest and passive resistance. 50 flags are displayed at the SMFA, along with a video documenting the installation.
More than color, it is sound that is central to many of the pieces in ”Disponible.” Artist Arturo Hernández Alcázar’s piece, “Never Work,” installed in the outdoor courtyard, uses sound as its primary medium. Alcázar says, “For so many of these pieces, sound is indispensable. In Mexico everything is always loud.” In his piece, the sound of the workers dismantling old computers is a reminder of the absence of the workers themselves. “It’s a kind of presence,” Alcázar says. He began work on this project as early as 2007.  Two years later, it debuted as part of a show about recycling materials in Mexico City’s Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC). His original intention was to bring the workers themselves to dismantle the museum’s old computers in a kind of live installation, yet the museum declined to sanction such an idea.
Both at MUAC and now at the SMFA, “Never Work” occupies the main entrance. “I like this idea,” says Alcázar, “It’s more invasive.” To compensate for the absence of the workers themselves, he simply amped up the volume of his sound recordings. “We played it really, really loud,” he says with a smile. Alcázar is soft-spoken and reflective, making his incredibly loud work of art all the more intriguing and effective.
Part of Alcázar’s charm lies in his utter lack of pretension. He is very matter of fact about his work, and introduces his radical ideas without batting an eye. “I’m very interested in the sedimentation of capitalism,” he says, explaining the influence of the connection that the formed over the years with the workers he recorded. In many ways, “Never Work” champions these unseen but heard workers whose constant labour goes unacknowledged.
This same goal drives Teresa Margolles’ piece, “Las Llaves de la Ciudad,” which takes as its subject a key maker from Juárez, who inscribed keys for tourists. In keeping with the multimedia nature of the exhibition, Margolles has invited the key maker, Antonio Hernandez Camacho, to share his experiences of plying his trade in this troubled border town with visitors to the exhibition.
Margolles, who represented Mexico at the Venice Biennale in 2009, is perhaps a harsher critic of Mexico’s social reality than Alcázar. Soltan says that Margolles’ piece, like many others in the show, has a strong social message. “It is about the disposability of human beings.”

As a major American city and historic center of American politics, history, and art, Boston has always counted important world figures among its visitors. This fall, however, 25 of the 20th century’s most influential figures plan to make an appearance just beyond the city limits for the grand reopening of a small Watertown museum.
Perhaps one of Watertown’s best-kept secrets, the Armenian Library and Museum of America (ALMA) is celebrating the unveiling of a permanent collection of 25 original signed portraits by renowned Canadian-Armenian photographer Yousuf Karsh. Although Karsh’s photographs spanned a range of genres, it was his portrait photographs that brought him international fame and recognition. Following the publication of his now iconic portrait of Winston Churchill, British prime minister during World War II in LIFE Magazine, Karsh went on to shoot portraits of the some of the most well known figures of the 20th century, including Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa, and Ernest Hemmingway.
The upcoming ALMA exhibition “Karsh: Celebrating Humanity” will open on September 17. All of the featured portraits were donated to ALMA by Karsh’s widow, Estrellita Karsh. The unveiling of this exhibition coincides with the completion of ALMA’s two and a half month-long renovation, which was an effort to improve the quality of the facilities in light of such an important acquisition. Though Karsh’s photographs will now play a prominent role in the museum, regular visitors will still be able to find the Armenian artifacts that they are used to seeing. “The hope is that by re-facing  [the museum] we’ll have people coming in to see the Karsh photographs who will [then] be able to see a sampling of the Armenian artifacts,” says Daniel K. Dorian, a member of the Board of Trustees. “We’re hoping to increase the foot traffic so that people get an opportunity to see some of these things.”
ALMA’s artifacts include a vast collection of Armenian coins, carpets, ceramics, laces, manuscripts, and religious objects, as well as an extensive library of titles pertaining to Armenian culture. Since ALMA’s founding in 1971, when it first displayed its artifacts in the basement of a Belmont church, the collection has grown in both quantity and quality. Despite its move to a larger space in the early 90s, ALMA can still only display 3% of the its collection at any given time.
This substantial growth stems partially from private donations made by survivors of the Armenian Genocide. However, the museum’s collection spans a much greater portion of Armenian history, which has witnessed repeated episodes of conflict and warfare. “Armenian history is replete [with] Armenia being the battleground between eastern and western empires … and somehow,  [the Armenian people] came up with a multifarious culture that staggers the imagination,” says Haig Der Manuelian, chairman of ALMA’s board of trustees.
Despite the rich history behind its artifacts, ALMA still remains relatively unknown to the residents in the greater Boston area. ”A lot of people don’t know about it,” says board member Robert Megerdichian. “What [ALMA] need[s] is people to get the word out and the hope is that this exhibit will do that.”

An oft-cited blurb from John H. Updike ’54 about Nabokov reads, “Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written…ecstatically.” Part of the genesis of the lingual enthusiasm that so characterizes Nabokov’s work is his status as an outsider to American culture, and his joy as a newcomer to its language and cultural forms. Christopher Owens, the mastermind behind Girls, was born into the famous cult, Children of God, which forbade its members from partaking of pop culture and, most significantly, rock music. A relatively recent convert to somewhat less-cultish indie music, Owens and bandmate JR White burst onto the music scene with their idiosyncratic, joyous debut “Album.” The new “Father, Son, Holy Ghost” is an absolute masterpiece rife with an unadulterated joy of music; each note on the record is played with a child’s exuberance at learning there is a world, and a whole, expressive language to which there is no limit.
Girls have traded the tight arrangements of their first album for shambolic pop gems that allow for subtler dynamics. On “Alex,” the steady sixteenth notes on the hi-hat alleviate the gurgling bass and rolling guitars, before the song abruptly stretches into halftime, slinging the song into one of the most beautiful passages on the album. A clenched, hopeful electric guitar lays staccato notes over a warm acoustic guitar that doubles them an octave down. The drums place peaceful snare accents under the unexpected relief before kicking the momentum up again. The guitars return—one droning, the other swaying in Smashing Pumpkins-esque compression.
Though Owens’s refined melodies render the lyrics almost superfluous, they remain crucial to the album’s appeal. Almost every track takes love or longing head on, but he elegantly subverts his clichés through layers of bisexuality, trauma-patient quirk, and some vaguely oedipal lines—as on the rampaging surf rocker “Honey Bunny” when he sings, “Mama / She really loved me…I need a woman who loves me.” On “Alex,” Owens sings, “Alex has black hair / Who cares? / Well, I do.” The song’s simple lyrics derive tremendous pathos from the elation of the music, but more than anything, Owens’s earnest delivery sells the line. To every cliché, there’s an ounce of truth—especially to that one—and given the enthusiasm of an incredibly talented pop auteur who somehow lived much of his existence outside pop’s deadening, repetitious influence, even clichés resound as if they’re being uttered for the first time.
The exception to this rule is, “How Can I Say I Love You,” the goofy music and irritating refrain of which—“How can I say I love you?”—grates with the irritation of excessive irony. Within the context of the album, it seems more like a defiant extension of Girls’s general fascination with kitsch, but it remains one of the albums weakest tracks.. Occasionally, as on the bombastic “Die,” they fail to reappropriate pop music forms and settle, instead, for simple emulation. On these tracks, their joy translates into self-indulgence. “How Can I Say I Love You,” however, signals a tonal shift on the album, away from Beach Boys pop, towards prog rock’s epic codas and gospel back-up singers—see “Vomit.” The synthesized strings, sinewy acoustic guitar, and steadily building drums on “Just a Song” are reminiscent of Led Zeppelin’s most lush, orchestral folk rock. He sings again and again “Love / Love / Love / Love / It’s just a song,” a marked emotional departure from much of the album. The sort of manic energy embodied in this shift keeps the album lively and honest. “Forgiveness,” too, washes the peppy swagger of “Magic” into a lovingly crafted seven minutes and 49 seconds of heartbeat-slow, soothing rock music about forgiveness and hope, accompanied by a full-on redemptive guitar rockout at the end.
Not every album wants to be loved—some just want to manipulate your emotions, or freak you out. But “Father, Son, Holy Ghost” is an album that takes seriously its own power as a work of art, and an intimate object of affection. Owens wants to be heard not out of thirst for fame, but for the meaning he personally knows good music can hold to those who seek it. The record is a tender, nuanced reflection on the sorts of pervasive, eternally enticing themes that, only when raised over roiling organs, through tight harmony or loudly atop full-throated guitars, can seem for an infinitely repeatable half hour to make sense. This album brings with it all the joy that comes from hearing “Alex has blue eyes / Who cares?” and realizing that somehow you do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a torrentially rainy Sunday evening, by all standards a terrible night to go to a concert, but Seoul’s biggest classical concert hall was filled to capacity. The audience wasn’t even just full of old white people like it is in most concerts I go to in North America. I can understand the lack of white people. It’s South Korea, after all. But how was I to explain the young couples who were evidently on dates, or the women in their mid-20s to -30s having a night out with their girlfriends—at a classical music concert, and a chamber music concert at that?
An absurd amount of my time when I’m in the States or in Canada is devoted to anxiety disorder–level worrying about what seems to me to be the impending death of classical music in North America. The rational parts of my brain tell me I am not to worry, that classical music is such an enduring and timeless art form that it is sure to survive. But if, God forbid, our collective attention spans decline and our economy stretches so thin that the death of an entire art form is unavoidable, then where am I going to get the highs that only listening to Mahler symphonies live can give me? Well, I’ll have to go to South Korea, apparently.
The man responsible for filling that concert hall was Richard Yongjae O’Neill, a Korean-American violist. How did a violist, the butt of most classical music jokes in North America, manage to achieve such a feat? O’Neill created and now leads an ensemble named “Ditto” which is shorthand for divertimento. Divertimento is a genre of classical music that was born as background music for social functions in the 18th century, and lightheartedness is at its center. The members of Ensemble Ditto take their namesake to heart. They play approachable music, fun and dramatic classical pieces with loud bangs and emotional phrases.
That doesn’t explain all of their appeal, of course. If that were the case, every “Classical Music Lite” concert would sell out. Ensemble Ditto also happens to be composed of some of the most attractive Korean men I’ve had the pleasure of laying eyes on. They weren’t the most skilled musicians I’ve heard, but they were tall and fit, had great hair, and wore tailored designer suits. I overheard more than a few women swooning over them, and a couple of men complaining about how it was a bad idea to bring their girlfriends to the concert.
The ad campaign for this concert was also nothing like other classical concert ad campaigns. For one, it actually had an extensive ad campaign, unlike most classical concerts. The posters were like posters for rock and pop shows: black and white photography, dramatic lighting, sexy men, and trendy fonts. Ensemble Ditto also made use of social media like Twitter and Facebook, doing ticket giveaways and previews. The thing was, Ensemble Ditto was presenting itself as a group of stars and celebrities, and less as musicians and artists. And it worked.
Classical musicians have long been highly regarded in Korea as stars and celebrities, though not in the same way as Ensemble Ditto. The tradition may have started in 1974 when Myung-Whun Chung brought home a joint second prize at the prestigious International Tchaikovsky competition. At that moment in history it was a big deal that a Korean could even go marching into the Soviet Union, let alone demonstrate that a Korean could excel at something there. He was received back in Korea with a parade reminiscent of the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony. There’s footage of him standing on a roofless convertible holding a huge bouquet, riding down a main street waving to cheering masses. After years of Japanese occupation, the Korean War, and division into two separate countries, Koreans would take any excuse to demonstrate their nationalism. Classical music became a vessel for such demonstration, and it is to this day.
Indeed, Chung has continued to be the pride of Koreans. The Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra led by Chung signed a 10-record contract with Deutsche Grammophon this past April, making them the first Asian orchestra to be signed by the prestigious label. Despite my impressions from Ensemble Ditto, it’s not as though classical music in Korea is all spectacle and no substance. At this year’s Tchaikovsky competition, five Koreans placed in the final rounds and two of them were first-prize winners.
I felt a lot of admiration for the rapid spread of art in Korea, though there were moments of embarrassment as well. I got press tickets to a performance by the Cambridge King’s College Choir. To start the program, they sang a beautiful, quiet piece with a very subtle ending. I began to clap, but stopped myself abruptly when I realized I was the only one doing so. It wasn’t that the audience members were dissatisfied with the boys’ performance. The Korean audience was so used to the dramatics of classical music that it was out of their minds that a classical piece could end pianissimo.
The Koreans have a solution to this too. There are lectures open to the public all over the city given by music professors and columnists on the basic history of classical music and how best to appreciate it. Il-Bum Chang, a prominent DJ of KBS, the radio station for which I was an intern, gave one such lecture series, and his experience teaching showed through in his commentary on air. He gave fun anecdotes in his incredibly friendly voice, all the while subtly educating all who listened—there were a surprisingly large number of them, too. The station was also making a large-scale attempt to educate the masses; it produced a series of CDs, each of which focused on an important composer and contained explanations of as well as selections from his or her oeuvre.
It was difficult for me to make sense of the contradictory emotional responses I had to my experiences of the classical music scene in Korea. On the one hand,  I felt pride for a country whose culture seemed to grow so rapidly—to bracket their even more impressive economic growth. On the other hand, I kept feeling that they were blurring the line between entertainment and art. This feeling was unsettling because classical music is foremost a thing of true beauty for me, and  as such is something I hold dear. But perhaps I’ve been holding pretentions all along, thinking that the distinction between entertainment and art is nonnegotiable. One thing I am sure of though: the Koreans’ methods, though worth questioning, are definitely correlated to the rampant vitality of classical music there, and it would do North American musicians good at least to think about taking a new approach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tenth anniversary of the events of September 11th, 2001 left me, like all Americans, deeply unsettled. I was not just upset for the victims and the families of victims—of which I was almost a member, as my father was a radio engineer who often worked at the transmitter site at the top of 1 World Trade—but I was hurt and angry on behalf of the veterans, active duty soldiers, first responders, and their families as well. When our president refers to our generation as the “9/11 Generation”, and when our vice president remarks that "never before in our history has America asked so much over such a sustained period of an all-volunteer force," the tragicomic understatement in their words is almost too much to bear.
As a nation, we’ve been hurt by the lies—by how this president campaigned as anti-war and stridently anti-Patriot Act, yet has involved our nation in yet another conflict irrelevant to our security interests. President Obama has consistently delayed the deadline for drawdown in Iraq, and has perpetuated the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld police-state practices which have done irreparable damage to the population’s perception and practice of our constitutional rights by expanding the use of extrajudicial killings and wiretaps of US citizens and further endangering an already-damaged notion of due process of law.
Our citizenry has been so psychologically scarred that we are literally terrorized by our own government into believing that these sacrifices of liberty, nihilistic overseas adventurist wars which have absolutely no connection to the events of 9/11, and our government’s schizophrenic actions and responses in each of these cases are somehow all related to the cause of freedom. This is ludicrous. It is a unique breed of violent, uninhibited madness.
Yes, the tenth anniversary was depressing. More has changed in this decade than in any other in the history of the American republic—that’s because this has been the decade that has witnessed the American republic’s death. I regret to admit the veracity of Benjamin Franklin’s famous remark that “those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” We have given up our liberties for a hollow, pretend protection, and in the trade have lost both real freedom and real safety from tyranny, seen or unseen, domestic or foreign.
Our generation will be defined by how we deal with the reality of what happened on September 11, 2001 and how successful we are in dismantling the fascist excesses of power, created under the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld administration in the events’ wake and strengthened and canonized by the Obama-Biden-Clinton administration. To truly honor the lives lost at Ground Zero, in Shanksville, and in Washington D.C., first we must, with great conviction, oppose the resulting fraudulent wars of imperialism and demand that our government—for the people, by the people—respect the rights inherent of American citizenship, endowed by our creator, reinforced in our compact of law, and owed to each other as inheritors of the American experience.
Ivy League students have the blessing of intelligence, resources, work ethic and access that primes us for great success in whichever endeavors we choose. But we have too much cynicism and not enough courage or heart—and we are not always successful in choosing the endeavors that support the cause of regular citizens against encroaching powers, public or private. Our leaders’ rhetoric should serve to inspire us in reverse: The vice president is right that much has been asked of our nation. We must deliver something, but it must be against the wishes of the powerful and for the benefit of those who have been consistently lied to, spied on, sent to die in the Middle East, arrested and held without cause, arrested for practicing free political speech in their cities and towns, and arrested or detained for the color of the skin and their expressions of faith. And, too, for all those who have raised legitimate unanswered questions about the events of September 11, 2001, and who have been silenced, threatened, or shunned.
We are the 9/11 Generation, as President Obama and others declare us. But that does not mean that we are obliged to keep sacrificing for a corrupt system of power instead of, as citizens, demanding its fundamental reconstitution; this moniker does not mean that we will turn over our liberties easily, or succumb to the cloak and dagger untruths which serve the powerful against the many. By the horror that we have lived and mourned on this tenth anniversary, we must remember that only we have the power to demand the end of lies and the return of justice. We are the only people who can make things right.

“I got the blues thinking of the future, so I left off and made some marmalade. It’s amazing how it cheers one up to shred oranges and scrub the floors,” D.H. Lawrence wrote.
For all the students who have never cleaned dorms, the idea of working for Dorm Crew is unfathomable. Their hesitance is understandable—Dorm Crew workers sometimes have to clean the worst of all possible bathrooms, with mysterious hair on the walls, stains on the toilet, and flakes of unidentifiable white matter stuck to the tiles—but that doesn’t mean that Dorm Crew has nothing to offer to student employees.
In fact, manual labor can help students build character, something that Harvard has placed much emphasis on recently. Manual labor performed through Dorm Crew can help foster a sense of community and appreciation for the school. Given the benefits it has to offer, Dorm Crew deserves a special slot in every student’s calendar.
Harvard should introduce a service requirement asking students to take part in Dorm Crew activities, such as setting up chairs for events through the Yard Operations crew, organizing facilities with the Facilities Management Operations, dusting dorms, helping in the kitchens, or, yes, cleaning bathrooms. Students would have the option to work alongside their friends, and by the time they graduate would have to fulfill 40 hours of service to the college.
Many academic institutions, both high schools and colleges, public or private, already have a service requirement. North Carolina School of Science and Math, a public high school, requires its students to volunteer for three hours in a school department every week and for 60 hours during one summer. St. Paul’s School, a private boarding school in New   Hampshire, includes service as a part of graduation as well. Albert Dorman Honor’s College in New Jersey asks that its students fulfill 15 hours of service every semester.
Considering the previous policies, Harvard’s service requirement would be manageable in comparison. Nevertheless, students may complain—Rodrigo Plaza, ’14, Dorm Crew Captain for Cabot House, said in an interview that “a lot of students will be pissed” at the service requirement. “When I first started, the work could feel degrading at times,” Plaza said. “I couldn’t help thinking that I was cleaning somebody else’s toilet.”
But though wiping toilets may be discomforting, it is this very discomfort that wipes the film off students’ eyes. Patrick Duffy ’14 has worked considerably with Dorm Crew and states that the “work is very humbling, which is very important when you go to one of the most prestigious schools in the world.”
Jennifer Zhu, ’14, who worked for Spring Clean Up ’11, states that her experience with dorm crew has helped her understand the value of money. “Working for so many hours teaches you values more than people lecturing you…it’s a completely new experience. You feel more grown up and on your own, and it’s a genuine life lesson.”
Zhu also drew positive insights from the service hours the fulfilled at NCSSM, where she volunteered weekly in the kitchens. “My work gave me a whole new respect for people who do that on a daily basis,” Zhu. “It was definitely not too much to ask from us. We saw it more as a way to give back to the school.”
Similar sentiments can breed on Harvard’s campus with this new service requirement. Harvard has one of the best college dorm systems in the nation as well as top-tier facilities—gyms, dining halls, rock climbing walls—for its students. The least students can do is to give back.
Furthermore, students can connect with each other through their service and also really help other students by cleaning their spaces for them. “You get to know your Houses very well. I feel like I know the college in a very intimate way.” says Duffy. “It feels good helping another student. You’re cleaning their toilet for them.”
Such a service program at Harvard would benefit its community on all levels, from the individual student to the student body to the entire Harvard community and all its facilities.
St. Paul’s School states that its community service program is instilled to “educate the whole person.” In the end, an education needs to be a little dirty to be good.

Over the last month, three major American solar companies have filed for bankruptcy. Collectively these companies—Solyndra, Evergreen Solar Inc., and SpectraWatt—account for over 25 percent of American solar photovoltaic output. All three companies had received generous aid from the national and state governments.
Solyndra, once a Silicon Valley darling, received $525 million of federal loan guarantees in addition to $600 million in venture funding. President Obama visited their manufacturing headquarters last year and celebrated the company as a paragon of America’s clean energy potential. But now, Solyndra is laying off all of its 1,100 employees. Another company, Massachusetts-based Evergreen was solicited by Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 on the campaign trail to set up a manufacturing facility in the state. Once in office, Patrick boldly granted the company $76 million dollars in aid. Now, Evergreen too has shut down all its U. factories and is $485.5 million in debt.
Why are these major American solar companies dying like flies? Two words: subsidies and China.
The unfortunate reality is that globally renewable energy (excluding biomass and hydroelectric) remains a subsidy-dependent business. Without policies to promote them, current solar and wind turbine technology can’t compete with dirtier energy sources like coal. Over the last decade, steady growth in solar demand was driven by generous European subsidies. But earlier this year, Germany and Italy (the largest solar markets) sharply reduced their costly solar feed-in-tariffs in the face of the European debt crisis. Feed-in-tariffs are policies that incentivize consumers to install renewable energy by mandating utilities to pay consumers a high fixed price for the clean energy they supply to the grid. The tariff cuts have led to excess PV supply, driving prices down over 20 percent—killing many Western companies that were already wounded by fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers.
The Chinese are also feeling the price squeeze, but have been buoyed by their persistent growth in market share. Three top Chinese solar companies—Suntech Power, Yingli Green Energy and Trina Solar—just announced that their second quarter sales this year rose 33 to 63 percent compared to last year, which is quite a contrast from the situation in the U.S. The drivers behind the growing success of the Chinese solar industry are both obvious and subtle. Lower labor costs, cheap loans from state controlled banks, low environmental regulatory costs, and cheap land from the government have obviously led to lower Chinese prices. On a more subtle level the most successful firms have benefited from having Western educated managers, efficient automation, continued commitment to quality, and in some cases economies of scale and vertical integration. Intense price competition between Chinese firms has also helped.
What does all this mean for America? What can America do to become competitive in the clean energy race? Well, in an ideal world Congress and the President would pass an aggressive carbon tax to unleash market forces to develop, fund, and scale the most competitive clean energy ideas. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like a carbon tax will be happening anytime soon.
Regardless, important policies can and should be put in place to tackle America’s energy, climate, and competitiveness problems. Continuing the current practice of subsidizing specific companies like Solyndra in a commodity like industry, however, is not an effective, reliable or fair way to achieve these objectives. The recent cases of government-backed solar companies filing for bankruptcy show that political decision makers are not skilled venture capitalists. When the government hands out special loan back guarantees or tax breaks to individual firms like Solyndra, it is essentially unfairly and inefficiently picking winners, mindlessly risking tax payer dollars and unintentionally creating market distortions in the process.
Having learned their lesson from distorting economics, policymakers must now make broad and massive research and development investments in game, changing clean energy technologies. Rather than betting on individual companies in a commodity like industry, tax-payer dollars should go towards creating leap-frog technologies that will one day allow for clean energy to compete without subsidies and position American companies to be leaders in the field. Cutting edge black silicon solar technology (developed here at Harvard), nano-structured solar cells that mimic photosynthesis and air-borne wind turbines; these are the kind of innovations that government should be much more aggressively funding. We need to simultaneously advance a whole host of disruptive technologies.
America must come to terms with the fact that it can’t beat China in manufacturing commoditized products. Our share of the global clean energy pie will have to be won through creativity and innovation. We must accept the new norm that we’ll have to constantly out innovate the rest of the world in order to stay competitive. Whatever ideas we come up with, low-cost competitors will copy in a few years or months. We should look to Apple for inspiration, the company that stands tall in a commoditized world by relentlessly focusing on reinventing itself, creating new paradigms, pushing out new products, and improving old ones.

On a typical autumn day, a casual glance across Harvard Yard will reveal verdant grass, colorful chairs, and mobs of tourists. Rain or shine, these tourists fill the Yard, hoping to snap a picture with a Harvard squirrel, the John Harvard statue, or even a Harvard student. While the relationship between the student population and our enthusiastic daily visitors often remains tolerant at best, recent signs placed in the Science Center indicate that boundaries for tour groups on campus may be more forcefully stated in the future.
Specifically, according to the signs, unofficial tour groups will no longer be allowed in the Science  Center. This policy was instigated by reports of tourists interrupting classes and general activity in the building. Potentially due to its central location, four main entrances, and large restrooms, the Science Center has become a prime target for curious tourists eager to get a closer look at student life. These inquiring actions are not usually malicious. However, in the end, Harvard is an educational and research institution, and the quality of a Harvard education takes precedence over our accessibility to visitors. The additional signs in the Science Center seem a sensible and subtle way to reinforce this notion, and to discourage disruptive behavior.
We understand that Harvard is a historic landmark of national importance and must be open to the public in some way. Although Harvard has grappled with its status as a tourist attraction for years, in a campus surrounded by gates, the ability for visitors to drop by freely serves as reminder of Harvard’s integration in a larger world. The University has recently taken steps to accommodate visitors; for example, the presence of the multicolored chairs in the Yard during Fall. For the most part, the symbiotic relationship works well and without too much conflict: Most tourists from around the world respect the University and the rights of the students to continue on with their lives. It is when tourists begin to upset the daily proceedings of the educational institution that stricter lines must be drawn.
When tourists compromise the quality of the education—either by harassing students, entering classrooms noisily, or intrusively taking photographs—they become a problem. Tourists flock to Harvard because of its reputation for excellence. When the daily proceedings that engender such success are hindered by negligent or overeager visitors, the University has an obligation to intercede.
Admittedly, part of the problem arises when the rules for behavior are not entirely clear. In the case of the new Science Center regulations, the introduction of specific parameters outlined by the signs will help eliminate confusion. At the same time, the boundary between tour groups and a small group of visitors is still ill-defined. While additional signs in the Science Center also reiterate the University’s policy against photos inside classroom buildings, the methods of reinforcement and repercussions are also ambiguous. The Science Center need not become a site of totalitarian practices, yet additional clarity and specificity would help all involved.
In doing so, Harvard can be free to continue the twin traditions of inclusion and excellence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since University President Drew G. Faust and fellow deans made a public commitment to sustainability efforts in 2008, the University has passed several milestones in its campaign to become more environmentally friendly.
In April, President Faust announced that Harvard had achieved a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2006, a significant achievement  for the “Green Is the New Crimson” initiative, which aims to achieve a 30 percent reduction by 2016.
And on August 1, Harvard was granted its 50th building certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an award indicating that a building is energy and resource efficient.
But despite the increased visibility of green programs, some students say they wish their peers would take sustainability more seriously.
“We always need more involvement from the student body because compared to other colleges, we aren’t as committed,” said Rebecca J. Cohen ’12, social chair of the Harvard College Environmental Action Committee. “At the same time I think that there’s a very supportive face of students, and as a whole, students are aware of environmental issues.”
Colin B. Durrant, Harvard’s manager of sustainability communications, similarly emphasized the importance of student involvement in campus sustainability efforts.
“Throughout the university over 50 student REPs and Student Sustainability Associates work in dorms, houses and in the campus community to educate their peers about steps they can take to reduce energy and conserve resources,” Durrant wrote in an email.
Although the Office for Sustainability encourages students to participate in the “Green Is the New Crimson” campaign, some students said they feel that the initiative is more of a one-sided effort and that it desperately needs more student support.
“Regardless of what Harvard does as an institution, we need to change the way students feel about the environment, because our actions as individual students have a bigger impact than any poster campaign that the university puts on,” said Gorick K. H. Ng ’14. “I’m talking in terms of whether it be using fewer paper towels, taking only what you can eat in the dining halls, or unplugging appliances when they’re not being used.”
Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14, a student not directly involved in the green initiative on campus, noted that she has repeatedly witnessed student wastefulness in her experience as an undergraduate.
“I’ve noticed that in the house dining halls, the copious amount of paper and plastic that is used by students says that we have a lot to work on in terms of usage of non-recyclable items,” Rabinowitz said.
In his statement, Durrant noted that there are many nontraditional opportunities for students to get involved in sustainability advocacy.
Among these are the Office for Sustainability’s grant program, which  funds creative environmental projects by undergraduate and graduate students that help contribute to Harvard’s on-campus sustainability goals.
Another program is the Green Cup competition, in which undergraduate houses compete to reduce their carbon footprint.
“Students have always been a key driver of Harvard’s sustainability efforts,” Durrant wrote. “They advocate for action on campus and explore creative ideas to help address environmental concerns.”

Carrying plastic bags stuffed with produce, a shopper at the Harvard Allston Farmers’ Market reflected on the state of the University-created outdoor market: “They’re starting to lose people out there, aren’t they?”
Local farmers and community members have echoed this shopper’s off-hand remark.
They say that unlike the bustling Harvard Farmers’ Market outside the Science Center, the Allston market—envisioned as part of the University’s outreach into the Allston community—has had trouble attracting customers and vendors.
Last week the number of stands selling fresh vegetables, fruits, baked goods, and pasta, at the Allston Market decreased from the usual seven or eight to two.
Meanwhile, the market on Harvard’s campus continues to attract over 10 vendors weekly and has 17 vendors listed on the Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services website.
After Allston residents asked Harvard to bring a farmers’ market to their community, HUHDS’ Food Literacy Project actualized the project in 2008.
“I think it’s a nice thing to have, you get fresh fruits, vegetables, and it’s a nice use of the parking lot,” said Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association.
But local farmers said that the lack of foot traffic has deterred them from returning to Allston’s market.
“At the moment Allston has been a slow one that only needed one of our staff members,” said Jim A. Ward, co-owner of Ward’s Berry Farms. “I’ve heard from my staff that they don’t think that’s a fantastic location for the Allston market, as opposed to the Harvard market.”
Lanni Orchards, a farm that sells products on Tuesdays outside the Science Center, sold in Allston until this year.
“We just didn’t do that great last year at Allston,” said Lisa Lanni, the office manager.
And many vendors said that when they are short on staff they have made cuts to their operations at the Allston Farmers’ Market.
During the summer many of the farms staff students to run the markets, but with the start of the academic year they are left short-handed.
“It’s one of the those seasonal business struggles,” Ward said.
He said the farm plans to return to the Allston market after new staff members are hired and trained.
In order to attract shoppers, the University said it hosts a variety of events—including performances from musicians and a book festival—in addition to handing out fliers and sending emails to attract shoppers.
“We will continue to support the farmers’ market in Allston in a variety of ways and encourage local residents and Harvard affiliates to help us generate a successful market environment,” said University spokesperson Lauren Marshall.
But some residents feel that Harvard’s efforts have not been successful.
“When it’s just you and five other shoppers, it doesn’t really matter what kind of creative programming they have,” said resident Harry E. Mattison. “As far as farmers’ markets go, I would rank it toward the bottom.”
Some shoppers said that even though the market is smaller than many others, they still appreciated having a farmers’ market in Allston.
“It’s near my work so it’s convenient,” said Gina Halstead, who works for Harvard Business School. “My co-workers and I all come here to take a break, shop, and go back to work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law school Professor Elizabeth Warren will announce her candidacy for senator of Massachusetts Wednesday, ending months of speculation over whether she would run in the 2012 election.
Warren, best known for her work on consumer financial protection, will battle current Senator Scott P. Brown who is seeking a full six-year term next year.
Warren launched an exploratory committee in August to test the political waters surrounding a potential Senate bid, sparking excitement among Democrats who were stunned two years ago when Brown managed to win the seat formerly held by Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 for nearly five decades.
“The pressures on middle-class families are worse than ever, but it is the big corporations that get their way in Washington,” Warren said in a statement today. “I want to change that. I will work my heart out to earn the trust of the people of Massachusetts.”
Warren will not make any formal announcement of her candidacy and will launch her campaign by meeting with voters in Boston Wednesday morning. Later in the day she will make stops around the state, including New Bedford, Framingham, Worcester, and Springfield.
Warren entered the national spotlight after the 2008 financial crisis when she became a prominent advocate for American consumers, pushing for increased regulation of Wall Street and transparency in the financial services industry.
Though the recently created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild, Warren was unable to lead the agency because Senate Republicans made clear that they would block her confirmation if Obama nominated her as director.
In an end run around Senate Republicans, President Obama chose to appoint Warren to a special advisory position that would allow her to oversee the design of the bureau while avoiding Senate confirmation. Ultimately, she was passed over as the bureau’s director.
Warren will face a tough race against Brown, who has already raised about $10 million in campaign funds. Last month, the Brown campaign called on its supporters to donate in anticipation that “the Democratic political establishment is going to pull out all the stops next year.”
Warren is expected to have considerable financial and political support from national Democratic networks. In the past several weeks liberal advocacy organizations including EMILY’s List and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee have begun collecting funds and organizing volunteers on Warren’s behalf.
During the campaign Warren will likely have to contend with Republican charges that as a Harvard professor she is out of touch with the average Massachusetts voter.
Brown—who emerged from the state senate to beat out Martha Coakley in 2010’s special election—has billed himself as the average, rugged man who drives a pick-up truck.
“[Democrats] are so obsessed with winning this seat back that Washington elitists are trying to push aside local Democrat candidates in favor of a liberal Harvard professor from Oklahoma,” the Brown campaign wrote in a recent letter soliciting donations.
Though Warren speaks openly about her time at Harvard, she has gone to great lengths to emphasize that she is also the child of a custodian and speaks frequently about her modest beginnings on “the ragged edge of the middle class.”
Warren also may be attacked for her lack of political experience and narrow range of expertise. Government professor Roger B. Porter noted her “little experience in elective politics.” But he praised her “conviction that large financial institutions engage in predatory and anti-consumer practices,” noting, however, that he disagreed with Warren's policy prescriptions.
Economics Chair John Y. Campbell said he does not consider her a general economic expert—but that she would learn in office.
“Her background is specifically in consumer finance and consumer financial protection. I wouldn’t say that she’s known as an economic expert, generally, but nor was Scott Brown, when he ran for Senate.”
Nevertheless Campbell said that despite her specific expertise, he thinks that “she is clearly politically quite effective.”

CLARIFICATION: SEPT. 14, 2011
An earlier version of the Sept. 13 article "Elizabeth Warren To Announce Senate Run" quoted Harvard Professor Roger B. Porter as praising Elizabeth Warren for her views on financial regulation and may have incorrectly implied that he supported her views on the issue, which he does not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beginning Tuesday night, Annenberg Dining Hall will extend its evening hours from 4:30 p.m. to midnight to provide freshmen with a central location to gather or study with friends.
Following its initiative to enhance student social spaces across campus, the College has decided to keep the dining hall open for members of the Class of 2015, proctors, and peer advising fellows, Sunday through Thursday night.
In a letter to the freshman class, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote that “After Hours at Annenberg will specifically address the need for social space among students who live in the Yard.”
Although Annenberg will be open until midnight, dinner service will still end at 7:30 p.m.
Brain Break, a self-service snack offering for late-night studying, will continue to run from 9:15 to 10:45 p.m.
Hammonds wrote that After Hours are also a response to feedback from members of the Class of 2014, “who consistently told us last year that they wanted more space outside of their dorm to hang-out with friends, study together, or just take a break.”
Dora H. Tao ’14, who lived in Pennypacker last year, said she spent most of her downtime hanging out with friends in their rooms. She said Annenberg’s extended hours will make the freshman dining hall seem more like upperclassmen dining halls.
“It will be really convenient for all the freshmen and definitely more spacious than just going to somebody’s room,” she said.
Likewise, Arleen B. Aguasvivas ’15, said she plans to visit Annenberg late at night for a study break and to meet new people.
“It will give us more opportunities to meet others, because people tend to bond more late at night while getting work done,” she said.
But some students said the extended hours may not be necessary.
“Annenberg is a place for people to eat and meet more freshmen, but not the best place to hang out or work until midnight,” Gashaw Clark ’14 said. Clark also said he believes there are plenty of social spaces, including common rooms that are often underutilized.
Other recent initiatives that the College has implemented to increase social spaces include the Mather multimedia lab, the Eliot Grille activity space, the Student Organization Center at Hilles, the Cabot Café, and the Quad Grille lounge space in Pforzheimer House.

Harvard Transportation Services introduced a new shuttle route on Monday that will connect the Cambridge and Allston campuses in an extended loop from 7:20 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekdays.
The route, temporarily called “Allston Campus III,” will circle around both sides of the Charles River, bringing passengers from Soldiers Field Park to the Business School, the stadium, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Square, Harvard Law School, Maxwell Dworkin, Memorial Hall, Lamont Library, and back to Allston.
The two shuttle buses on the new cross-campus route will provide service every 20 minutes.
Prior to Monday, the only services linking the Cambridge and Allston campuses were the Soldiers Field Park routes, which ran from 7:20 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, leaving no shuttles for commuters to cross the river from late morning to mid-afternoon or in the late evenings.
Even when service was available, those shuttles only came about every 45 minutes.
“It’s a major, major improvement for the two campuses,” said Carl A. Tempesta, manager of facilities for Passenger Transport Services.
David E. Harris Jr., general manager of Passenger Transport Services, said that a team of Campus Services leaders began plotting the new route last fall, when plans for the new Innovation Lab at the Business School were being finalized.
Tempesta said that the team that designed the route hopes the service will not only better serve athletes, but also University formal events.
In order to accommodate the new shuttle route, Transport Services will be adding two newly reconditioned shuttles to its fleet.
The 35-foot shuttles, which were delivered to Harvard this Saturday, will have “slightly upscaled” cushioned seats.
A few face-to-face seats on the shuttles will have pull-down table tops between them.
The shuttles are being painted with Harvard insignias and outfitted with GPS systems, Harris said. He anticipates that the shuttles will be up and running within the next three weeks.
“We hope that the service will be well-received by the Harvard community,” Harris said.
He also encouraged riders to provide feedback on the new route. “We hope people will take advantage of the service and ride the shuttle,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most freshmen spend the first weeks of the school year slowly adjusting to college life. But standout freshman soccer player Lauren Urke has had no problem adjusting to the fast-paced play on the pitch.
With a goal and an assist on Sunday, Urke helped lead the Harvard women’s soccer team over the University of Connecticut.
Despite the Huskies’ 30-year dominance over the Crimson, a strong freshman class—headlined by Urke—shifted the balance in Harvard’s favor. In the second minute of play against UConn at Ohiri Field, Urke scored the first goal of her promising career.
“[Co-captain Melanie Baskind] got the ball at the top of the 18 [meter mark], and she played me a through ball,” Urke explained. “The keeper came out, and I was able to finish it.”
Coming off of a highly decorated high school career, Urke has wasted no time turning heads at the collegiate level, according to coach Ray Leone.
Leone is not the only coach who has noticed Urke’s great start, as she was named the Ivy League’s co-rookie of the week on Monday.
“[It was a] fantastic goal, a great little play where [Urke] got free in the backside,” he said. “It was amazing—she’s a winner.”
In the start of the second period, the Crimson got things going early with a goal 10 minutes into the half, and Urke was in the middle of the action. This time, Urke fed junior Alexandra Conigliaro a perfect ball that she was able to head into the back of the net, giving Harvard a 2-1 advantage. It was all the Crimson needed.
“[Urke] just responded to whatever pressure there was and whatever nerves she had, and really stepped up for us,” Baskind said.
“We are all very proud of her,” Conigliaro added. “She’s coming in as a freshman, starting in the first game, and she’s really making an impact.”
Only a couple weeks into her Harvard career, Urke, who is interested in studying engineering, has made a seemingly flawless transition into the Crimson program. Urke credits the cohesive team dynamic in helping her adjust so quickly.
Urke’s early-season heroics also reflect the hard work she has put into her game throughout her pre-Harvard career, especially this past summer.
“[Urke] is a freshman that came in really fit and proved from day one that she could compete for a starting spot,” Baskind said, “She is incredibly hard working and always asking questions ... She is a great addition to the team.”
Besides competing with her club soccer team from her hometown of Medina, Minn., Urke also frequently took to the field for intense conditioning.  Urke’s high-level fitness can be partly attributed to the oxygen depriving drill called “120s,” which consist of a full-field sprint followed by a recovery jog back, repeated 10 times a session.
With her offseason dedication, Urke seems completely focused on what lies ahead for the women’s program.
“This team has huge potential,” she said. “Our goal is to win the Ivy Championship, which I know we can do ... We will use the win [against UConn] as a stepping stone for what we can do in the future.”
With Sunday’s win, its third in a row, the team is off to its best start in a decade, holding a 3-1 season record and perfect 3-0 home record.  The Crimson will try to take advantage of its momentum as it shifts its attention to Wednesday’s game at Boston University.
With BU currently ranked 20th in the country with a 5-2-1 record for the season, a lot will be asked of Urke, both on Terrier turf and for the remainder of the season.
“She brings more than just those goals,” Conigliaro said. “She definitely has some smarts to her and is all around having a great impact on our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to build upon last year’s third-place finish at Nationals, the Harvard sailing team kicked off its 2011 campaign with several strong showings at a trio of regattas.
This past weekend, the No. 10 Crimson coed squad took second place at the Harry Anderson Trophy intersectional hosted by Yale, while the women’s team finished 10th at the Toni Deutsch ’58 Trophy at nearby MIT.
The sailing team also hosted the Harvard Invitational, its first home regatta of the season, facing off against local competition in Tufts and the two squads sent out by MIT, the Engineers and the Beavers.
The Crimson took second place at the brief one-day affair, finishing just four points behind the Jumbos.
“I think overall, [the weekend] was really good,” captain Brendan Kopp said. “It was our first weekend racing, and we’ve only had the beginning of September to train. We have been using that time to train as hard as we can. It paid off, and it was a good start.”
HARRY ANDERSON TROPHY
Having graduated five All-Americans at the end of last season, the Harvard coed sailing team’s prospects for the year were very much up in the air.
“It was our first major regatta of the season, and last year we lost some terrific seniors,” senior Emily Lambert said. “But we have a new crop of sailors.”
So far, those rookies stepped up to the challenge, as the Crimson put up 147 points to finish nine points behind the eventual champion, Wisconsin. Kopp skippered all ten races in the A-division for Harvard, with sophomore Sarah Pierson and freshman Richard Bergsund splitting time at crew. Lambert skippered in the B-division, and captain Alex Jumper, sophomore Ben Lamont, and Bergsund all took turns at the crew position.
“Richard really stepped up to the plate,” Lambert said. “He typically skippers in practice, but he made a good transition to crew this week.”
Kopp’s performance at the Harry Anderson Trophy regatta as the skipper earned him Harvard COOP Athlete of the Week honors.
TONI DEUTSCH ’58 TROPHY
The No. 8 Harvard women’s team opened its season with a 10th-place showing at the Toni Deutsch ’58 Trophy hosted by MIT. Sophomores Morgan Russom and Isabel Ruane put together the strongest performance for the Crimson, recording two first-place finishes, three second-place finishes and a third-place finish on the weekend. The A-division crew finished with 185 points.
In the B-division, sophomore Caitlin Watson and senior Caroline Lowe combined for three fourth-place finishes for Harvard, ending the weekend with 221 points. With 406 total points, the Crimson finished 10th in the field of 14 teams. Brown took first place with 266 points.
HARVARD INVITATIONAL
The Crimson coed squad hosted the 2011 Harvard Invitational, its second regatta of the weekend. The event only consisted of eight races, finishing up in just one day.
The class of 2015 flexed its muscles in Sunday’s regatta, as the squad sent out to compete was comprised entirely of freshmen looking for their first action at the collegiate level.
Freshman Gram Slattery skippered the A-division races with classmate Emma Smith at crew, and the tandem recorded two second-place finishes and a win to give the Crimson 27 points. In the B-division, freshman Brian Drumm teamed up with junior Nicholas Gordon to notch two wins, finishing with 24 points.
Harvard’s 51-point total was good for second place, just four points behind Tufts.
MIT rounded out the three-team field with 90 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the departure of Katherine Sheeleigh and the Class of 2010, I was unsure what to expect this season as a new beat writer for Harvard women’s soccer.
It was the start of a new era, one that reminded me of last September when I was covering men’s soccer. The class of 2009 had been one of the strongest in recent memory, featuring Andre Akpan, who was the best senior in the country that year. Though Sheeleigh does not boast Akpan’s stats, both alums finished their careers as Ivy League Player of the Year and were vital to their teams’ offenses. Any team that loses that kind of talent inevitably will have to rebuild.
After a year watching men’s soccer, I knew that rebuilding a team is no easy task. But I did have hope—co-captain Melanie Baskind is still on the team, and her veteran presence in the offense is something that her male counterparts lacked last year in the front line. In 2010, Baskind tied Sheeleigh for the team lead in goals scored with nine, and the then-junior amassed 22 points, trailing her former captain by three points. Baskind is also no stranger to accolades, earning Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2008 and landing on the All-Ivy first team after an impressive 2010 campaign. Like Sheeleigh last year, Baskind is currently in the running for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS award.
Though it is still too early to say definitively that Harvard has recovered from losing five seniors from last year’s squad—especially since all of its wins have been determined by just one goal—the team is moving in the right direction, and its new talent has been critical to the Crimson’s 3-1 record, its best start since 2001.
ROOKIE CHALLENGE
From the very first game, two rookies have stood out thanks to precocious performances: Meg Casscells-Hamby and Lauren Urke. Casscells-Hamby, the 2011 Florida Gatorade Player of the Year, has solidified her position as one of two primary playmakers (the other being Baskind) for Harvard. In the matchup against Long Island, the rookie played a role in sophomore Peyton Johnson’s goal to tie the match at one. She also perfectly timed a through ball to Baskind in the contest with Elon to give the Crimson the advantage.
Urke has done the same, but she’s done it all the way from the back line. The defender has shown a propensity to take the ball down the right flank and either cross a dangerous ball in the box or take a shot herself. Her offensive efforts paid off in Sunday’s win over UConn, scoring the first goal of the match and adding an assist later in the contest. She also earned recognition on Monday as the Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week.
The two aren’t the only freshmen contributors—two others, Kate Makaroff and Erika Garcia, have also seen significant playing time and are slowly finding a niche for themselves in the offense.
DON’T USE YOUR HEAD
Last year, Harvard coach Ray Leone had to recruit walk-on Mari Zumbro, utility player on the Harvard softball team, because of the team’s lack of healthy goalkeepers. Four games have been played this season, and already three of the Crimson’s listed four goalies have sustained injuries that have kept them out of recent games.
On Sunday, Leone called upon rookie Cheta Emba to protect the Harvard goal after sophomore Jessica Wright took a hit on the head and needed to be taken to the hospital to check for a concussion. The goalkeeper with the most minutes this season, junior AJ Millet, was already out after getting kicked in the head in the Crimson’s 2-1 win against UMass, and freshman Bethany Kanten is still recovering from a shoulder injury.
I guess one question that pops to mind is: will another walk-on be needed again? Who knows.
But a head injury is nothing to take lightly. After reading about the dangers of concussions, it is important for coaches to warn their players about sacrificing their heads in order to make a play.
It starts with practice, and emphasizing the proper techniques to avoid head trauma. Sometimes concussions are inevitable, but athletes must take every precaution to avoid them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05:
Fitzpatrick completed on 17 of his 25 pass attempts for 208 yards and four scores on Sunday, as the Harvard grad’s Buffalo Bills (1-0) routed the Kansas City Chiefs (0-1) on the road, 41-7.
In a day that made Fitzpatrick’s fantasy owners rejoice, the Bills' quarterback took apart a depleted Kansas City secondary that was lacking the services of hard-hitting safety Eric Berry.
Fitzpatrick wasted little time finding his rhythm, connecting with Scott Chandler from four yards out after the Chiefs fumbled on the opening kickoff. From there on out, Buffalo dominated, and Fitzpatrick looked a whole lot like another current Boston-area quarterback, never seeming to be in a hurry when delivering the football.
Sunday’s rout of last year’s AFC West division champs was a cathartic performance for both Buffalo and its Harvard-educated quarterback. For a team that hasn’t had a winning season in a decade, Bills fans have a glimmer of hope, in large part thanks to the man ESPN analyst Merril Hoge called “the most underrated quarterback in the National Football League.”
James Blake ’01:
 
 Another Harvard economics major, Blake fared far worse than Fitzpatrick, losing his second-round match at the U.S. open last week to David Ferrer.
Blake has struggled after the first round of tournaments this year. While he boasts a 12-1 record in first round matches, he is only 3-11 in later rounds.
While Blake has climbed back into the top 100 of the world rankings after a large freefall, the former No. 4 player in the world has more to worry about than an Ec p-set.
Desmond Bryant ’08:
Former Harvard standout Desmond Bryant earned a personal victory on a team that earns few—the 6'5” defensive lineman survived cut day for the Oakland Raiders.
Bryant, an undrafted free agent three years ago, has managed to stick with the Raiders and the NFL. Last year, he recorded 1.5 sacks while seeing limited action.
Bryant will be tuned into the Ryan Fitzpatrick show next weekend as his Raiders take on the Bills, although the closest he will be to physical contact with his co-alumnus will probably occur during postgame handshakes.
Frank Herrmann ’06:
Continuing the up-and-down week for former Harvard athletes, Cleveland relief pitcher and former Crimson hurler Frank Herrmann turned out a less-than-Ivy-quality performance last week against the White Sox on Sept. 8.
Herrmann failed to record a single out while yielding three runs, ballooning his ERA to a less-than-stellar 5.62.
The good news though is that his untarnished 4-0 record remains intact. And undefeated doesn’t sound too bad.
