After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We know the ethnic stereotypes: American college kids are known for their keg-clanging parties and industrial-strength livers, and Chinese students are generally perceived as unassuming and hard-working. And for being good with numbers. I’ll even confess that I touched down on the Beijing tarmac last year with the secret hope that, if during my year abroad I rolled around in their wizard dust long enough, I might absorb some math skills. Like long division.
We’re familiar with the facts: On the international Pisa tests last year, the Shanghai virtuosos locked up first prize in every test category, including math, science, and reading. In science, the United States limped in at 23rd of 65 countries, nestling itself comfortably between Hungary and the Czech Republic. Then, after a recent report found that the average American college student studies only 14 hours a week, the case for American complacency suffered its second round at the pillory. President Obama has now declared an “education arms race” with China, and the unspoken ultimatum hangs in the air like an ugly grade: Start studying or China will sweep us off our global throne.
What are the Chinese doing right? To many, Chinese education is a black box. The impression most of us have of the typical Chinese student is woven together from a bricolage of culturally pressed images—the honors student and the four-eyed physics wonk, the math nerd and the Rubik’s Cube black belt—but the fuller account of why Chinese students are who they are rarely floats into the public consciousness. That fuller story involves the gaokao.
The gaokao (rhymes with bow wow) is the college entrance exam that Chinese students take at the end of high school. In preparation, students select either sciences or humanities early in high school and study for up to 16 hours a day, often working through weekends, for the rest of their high school careers. The test itself can last several days, and ambulances and paramedics pepper the exam facilities to revive those who faint from exhaustion. If you ace the test, then you go to a topflight school  and are set for life (Chinese universities don’t care about anything other than your test score). If you’re sick during the test or for some reason perform sub-par, then you may take a “gap year” during which you study to take the test over again. My Beijing teacher told me that her high school sometimes gave her only half a day off per month from studying.
And we thought getting into Harvard took work.
Work is what it’s all about. For most of my year in China, I was a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Its majestic campus is home to established professors and brilliantly gifted students. My Chinese classmates could integrate and derive and differentiate equations with ease. But for all their firepower, where was the intellectual spark—the creative flare that can spring you out from inside the box?
There are boons to the gaokao system. Chinese students learn a lot from the process. The test also promotes meritocracy, rewarding the hard workers over the apple-polishers whom teachers shower with good grades. Above all, the test encourages old-fashioned hard work—students who perform badly may see their life aspirations begin to clot before their first kiss (many Chinese high-schools forbid relationships lest they interfere with schoolwork).
Yet my Chinese friends would have been the first to tell you that the gaokao encourages a lockstep approach to learning. One friend told me that her literature professor taught great books mostly by lecturing on the writer’s biographical information and various publication dates. Perhaps that’s what happens when you locate the golden snitch in a single test score: students come to kowtow to the gaokao, more or less allowing their education to revolve around its golden measuring stick. “You learn,” a friend told me, “not to always be right but at least to never be wrong.” 
Students become outcome-oriented. Test results become the be all and end all of one’s education.
This system produces high-voltage, water-cooled brainiacs who will channel their knowledge into an economy that is already rolling. Yet all this time spent on an educational conveyor belt can chill one’s creative flare. I talked to one Chinese father who said that his seventh-grade son’s writing ability had not improved since second grade.
Contrast all this with the American system, in which colleges select applicants based in part on recommendations and personal essays, which work to paint a portrait behind the GPA. Who you are is just as important as what you’ve done. This side of the Pacific, it’s easier to take intellectual risks and color outside the lines. That our life trajectory does not depend on our transcript gives us a safe space to struggle and fail.
As we try in the near future to reform our own education system, there will be pressure to look to China’s as the model. Resist.

Like many Harvard College seniors, the impending prospect of commencement has led us to reflect on the role Harvard has played in our lives. Through four wonderful years in Cambridge, we have been challenged and supported by exceptional professors and inspiring peers. As neurobiology, classics, and social studies concentrators we have found different academic homes, but we all agree Harvard has helped us grow intellectually and personally. 
Graduation marks the end of our time as undergraduates, but it also signals the beginning of a lifelong relationship with Harvard as alumni. We humbly acknowledge the generosity of the 361 previous classes in enabling us to attend Harvard as well as in supporting initiatives like financial aid and residential renovations, and we are forever grateful for it. Indeed, we look forward to receiving the first phone call asking us to pay it forward to a new generation of students.  
However, we are concerned there is a disconnect between the principles that drive the research and education activities of Harvard University and those that motivate the investment strategies of the Harvard Management Company. We would hope that Harvard’s investments reflect its mission, “to assume responsibility for the consequences of personal actions... to advance knowledge, to promote understanding, and to serve society.”  
As others have noted, the $32 billion Harvard endowment has recently been linked to several problematic companies and asset pools. It is widely believed that Harvard has recently invested in HEI Hotels, Alpha Natural Resources, and Emergent Investments, which have actively pursued business practices publicly demonstrated as harmful to people and the environment. These are just a few recently identified companies, but given its investment history, it would be naive to think that Harvard does not invest in ethically problematic but financially lucrative sectors including weapons production, environmentally-degrading energy companies, and manufacturing companies paying poverty-level wages. While in recent history students have successfully lobbied the HMC to divest from countries and companies with practices that are anathema to the common values of our community, student protest of singular, publicly divulged investments will invariably have limited impact. 
We instead hope to permanently establish a more responsible and transparent way to give back. To enable this, we are launching The Fair Harvard Fund. The Fair Harvard Fund seeks to motivate the Harvard Management Corporation to establish a Social Choice Fund to invest donations in alignment with established environmental, social, and governance criteria. All donations to the FHF will be held in escrow by a student and alumni coalition known as Responsible Investment at Harvard. The fund will be housed at the Cambridge Savings Bank, a locally owned Harvard Square bank, until the HMC creates a Social Choice Fund, at which point we will give the money to Harvard. If the HMC has not created a Social Choice fund by August 1, 2012, the money will be locally invested according to ESG criteria by the Responsible Endowments Coalition, a 501(c)3 non-profit, and responsibly managed until HMC creates such a fund. We hope to follow the success of alternatives such as Brown University’s Social Choice Fund in empowering alumni to be more involved in shaping the investment practices of their alma mater. 
While the specific goal of the FHF is the creation of a Social Choice Fund, we recognize that there are other key changes that would allow Harvard to become a leader in socially responsible investment. In line with progress being made by peer institutions like Columbia University and other major investors like the $226 billion CalPERS Pension Fund, we support recommendations that promote investment transparency and strengthen institutional accountability.
In addition to its benefits for donors who seek investment in line with ethical principles, we believe a socially responsible investment option will be financially favorable for Harvard by guaranteeing higher donation rates from past and future alumni. We laud the fact that Senior Gift feeds into the Harvard College Fund, which is not invested, allowing graduating seniors to collectively support current and future students and circumventing concerns about investment practices. However, the donations we make to Harvard as alumni after contributing to the Senior Gift bear no such guarantee, and we cannot in good conscience donate our money blindly; creating the FHF will allow us and many others to continue donating after graduation.
The inscription on Dexter Gate, often invoked at Commencement, reads, “Depart to better serve thy country and thy kind.” We hope to begin our lives as Harvard alumni in this spirit by simultaneously supporting our university and using our donations to serve rather than to harm others. To our friends and peers in the Class of 2012, we ask that you join us in donating to the Fair Harvard Fund at www.fairharvardfund.com. With your help, we can make a positive contribution to both our university and our world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring break has come and gone all too quickly. Some students may have gone home to enjoy some well-deserved rest, others may have sought distant shores to tan and party, but now it is time to face the hectic rush of the semester once more. As much of a burden as returning to school may seem, few would disagree that spring break provides a welcome relief from the daily stress of a Harvard existence, and even fewer would venture to suggest its abolition altogether. We love our spring break. So why not get a fall one as well?
It is easy to appreciate that the spring semester is organized in a far more student-friendly manner than the fall semester. There is a clear division roughly halfway through, one that allows students to catch their breath. Not only do students get a chance to relax, but midterms also tend to be scheduled much more conveniently. Professors tend to see spring break as the natural break that it is, and assign midterms immediately before the break begins. In the fall, on the other hand, and especially among some of the science courses, examinations seem to be scheduled in a hopelessly haphazard manner. In this way, students can form relatively precise expectations of what their workload will look like over the course of the semester.
The fall has Thanksgiving, but it is not quite the same. Not only is the break short, it also comes immediately before reading period. Thus, the small interval of subsequent classes appears to be almost an afterthought, with little potential for valuable intellectual development. The fact of the matter is that the fall semester is already longer than the spring one, so it could afford a trimming. Many other universities already have a fall break, with no detrimental effects to be discerned. Even the Yalies have one, encompassing Thanksgiving—and we hate to admit it, but in this case they’re doing things better than we are.
A fall break would allow students to pursue meaningful activities, such as the many service trips that the Phillips Brooks House Association sponsors over spring break. The academic and extracurricular load that students shoulder makes it difficult for many to engage in meaningful community service during the semester, a situation that could be remedied by more time off. By having two breaks during the school year, students could use one to go home or on vacation and one to pursue service, and not have to decide between the two.
If such a break were to exist, Harvard should also provide opportunities on campus for people who chose to stay. Programming similar to that of Wintersession, while not mandatory, could prove to be constructive and fun. In addition, it would be nice to see at least some of the dining halls remain open, a change that could also be applied to spring break. It seems fundamentally unfair that while those with the greatest financial need are the least likely to travel during spring break, students who remain have no access to affordable dining hall food.
To be fair to the administration, the academic calendar has seen significant positive change in recent years. In 2007, President Derek C. Bok’s administration did away with the horrific arrangement whereby fall final exams took place after winter break. Yet praising past improvements should not impede the pursuit of new ones. So Harvard, please give us a break.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not that the French media doesn’t report on the private lives of their various presidential candidates. Every newspaper stand I passed in Paris this weekend had a series of tabloids speculating on whether President Nicolas Sarkozy’s wife looks disheveled because she has a new lover or merely because she has a new baby. The gossip about current president Sarkozy and once-hopeful Dominique Strauss-Kahn alone gets quite juicy. It’s just that somehow, no matter how scintillating the speculation, the French seem to leave it out of the voting booths. Consider, for example, how socialist candidate François G. G. Hollande lost patience when a reporter asked him about Sarkozy’s love life and immediately turned the discussion towards more public scandals. It was apparently not politically necessary (that is, useful) for Monsieur Hollande to gossip on national television.
In contrast to Sarkozy, Newt L. Gingrich has been battling much harder to get past voter prejudice about his various infidelities and serial marriages. When John King asked him a question about whether he’d asked an ex-wife for an open marriage on national television, he, like Hollande, lost it, saying: “I think the destructive vicious negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office. I’m appalled you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that.” But Gingrich's concerns are more serious than those of the French presidential contenders because many political commentators worry that his personal history will keep him lagging behind the more politically liberal Mitt Romney. It’s evident in this race, as in so many, that Americans are preoccupied with the personal peccadilloes of their political leaders in a way that doesn’t reflect concrete political concerns.  Certainly, a politician’s private life reveals his character in many ways, but we focus more readily on private than public offenses. For example, pundits have happily noted that Gingrich led the charge against Bill Clinton’s adultery while undertaking his own. But he faced comparatively little heat for his accepting a large salary for work of a dubious nature from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Why do Americans care more about private hypocrisy than the kind that costs taxpayers millions of dollars?
It’s not just that sex sells and is more fun to talk about than tax policy. (After all, sex is interesting to the French, as well.) It’s not even that it’s what matters most to us—on the contrary, social issues are often voters’ least important concerns. Perhaps it’s that sex is also less confusing to Americans than politics. There is a quiet ignorance and ambivalence about the abstractions and complexities of non-sexual issues. Consider how many Americans confess that they don’t know how they feel about the debt ceiling (37 percent). Thinking about adultery (and contraception and abortion) is easier for Americans, perhaps, because they face personal decisions about these issues every day. We are less certain about how we feel about abstract political issues than sexual ethics, and we transform the latter into identity politics.
This leaves us vulnerable to harboring distorted political concerns. The evangelical Christians that Gingrich’s campaign has fought hard to win over probably are not concerned that his sexual scruples, or lack thereof, will directly affect their lives. Rather, they seek a candidate who represents them, and finding a candidate who shares (or onto whom they can project) their own moral views and aspirations is a bigger priority than creating better policies. It matters more what our politicians seem to say about us than what they do for us.
Our obsession with sex—more specifically, our readiness to immediately identify it as a moral issue in politics—probably explains in part why we so quickly turn to politicians’ sex lives when the time comes to vote. (It might even explain the recent explosion of discussions about contraception, which quickly devolved into argument about how women ought to run their sex lives.) All this is amusing but troubling. Sex is only one moral issue, and we would probably benefit from greater moral clarity about the rest. For that matter, Americans aren’t actually stars at managing their sex lives, yet it remains an issue about which we have strong opinions. How well can we make decisions about things we are less sure about? We are going to need to focus first on how the politicians we elect will affect the country and return to speculating about their bedroom habits later, perhaps once we’ve thoughtfully voted.

"I believe that there is a God. I didn’t used to. In fact, I was convinced that there wasn’t."
Corinne Tu ’13 smiles, dark brown hair framing her face and falling lightly around her shoulders. She pulls the edges of her sweater tighter around her torso. Tu spent her childhood in San Francisco, one of those children for whom religion seldom entered into the equation. She grew up to become the kind of girl who bristles at the mention of God: a teenager convicted in her atheism. “I thought I knew a lot about faith and lack thereof,” Tu recalls.
Christopher D. Wood ’12 remembers sitting in Science Center B for his LS1a lecture last semester—a video of ribosomal RNA translation was showing on the screen. The reading of genetic information, the sequencing of amino acids.  “I know it’s just a molecular mechanism, but somehow I was struck by—within this complexity, I saw intentionality,” Wood remembers. “I see behind all of that God’s creation.”
There are countless tales of students whose faith slips away during their time at college. The ones who ignore questions from mom about going to church on Sundays, or take a philosophy class that destabilizes their belief in God. The ones who no longer see the appeal of theism, or leave their copy of the Bible unopened on the bookshelf. You’ve heard of them. But this is different. This is a story about the students with burgeoning faith—the moments that caused them to question, and the experiences that led them to believe.
 Reasoning It Out 
“To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, ‘If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.’”—John 8:31-32
Jordan A. Monge ’12 is a philosophy concentrator. She looks you directly in the eye when she speaks. “Specifically, what do I believe?” she asks, then pauses for a moment. “I believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God, that he died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of the world. In so doing he conquered Satan, defeated death, and three days later was raised from the dead. So I believe in the bodily resurrection of Christ and that also includes a belief in God who is loving and just, merciful and powerful.”
For Monge, coming to know God was an arduous, conceptually challenging journey. “My story is very much one of seeing an intellectual appeal in Christianity,” Monge says. This, she recognizes, is rather atypical.
Monge, like Tu, entered college not believing in God. She grew up in Orange County, Calif. in a politically conservative, atheist family that places itself somewhere between the Rick Warren megachurch crowd and Hollywood’s secularists. Though the matter of God was always a topic of conversation in her family (her father is an atheist philosophy professor), Monge’s childhood was characterized by a marked absence of religious schooling.
She laughs a bit as she recalls her first encounter with the church. Monge was four or five, and her grandmother—a Catholic—decided to bring her to mass. After sitting through the service, she arrived home and eagerly announced: “Dad, I met Jesus today!” Her father, confused, asked, “Wait, what’s going on?” To which the young Monge eagerly replied, “Yeah, he was wearing a dress like when you graduated.”
Monge pauses, letting the punch line sink in. “I was talking about the priest and the robes…so I didn’t have a very clear idea of it.”
This religious ignorance soon transformed into a deep curiosity about Christ, prayer, and theism. Yet, Monge’s exploration led her to the conclusion that neither God nor Christianity was viable. “Why would I believe in God?’ she remembers asking. “There’s no evidence for God.”
In school, Monge had classmates who questioned her about her atheism, and often berated her for refusing to say the “under God” part of the Pledge of Allegiance. Monge argued with them, occasionally picking religious battles between games in gym. Once, the religious kid who sat next to her (who always sat next to her) found out she was atheist. Why don’t you believe in God? What’s wrong with you? He told the whole class. One boy threatened to come to Monge’s house and shoot up all the atheists. But that was only once.
However, Monge, who was always very concerned with social justice, found herself struggling in high school to find an atheist moral system in which she was satisfied. “I believed in human rights, but couldn’t really give an explanation as to why,” Monge says, recalling her frustration. She spent her time exploring what morality without religion would look like, pondering how to ground ethics and justify human rights if God didn’t exist. Monge didn’t come up with much, though. There should, she believed, exist a universal morality. But, as she examined the ethical allowances of various cultures, Monge found that what was permissible in one community was often morally suspect in another. It was the relativism that troubled her.
 John Joseph Porter (He Goes By Joseph Porter)
 “‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ says the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope.’”—Jeremiah 29:11
“When I came to college I had a friend who really pushed me on this issue and said, well, ‘why?’” Monge looks down at her lap.Freshman year, there were evenings spent talking on secondhand futons in Wigglesworth, hours devoted to philosophizing in empty music practice rooms. J. Joseph Porter ’12, who grew up a Christian, prodded Monge about her atheism, asking her to revisit the moral quandaries that had puzzled her throughout her high school years. He explained, questioned, and debated with her. Where do your strong ethical and political beliefs come from? How do you fit human consciousness and free will into your moral framework? How did everything come into being?
During this time, Porter helped Monge realize that, for there to be meaning in her life, God would have to exist. Once, Porter played her a song on the piano—“Hallelujah.”
That night, he remembers Monge praying.
“I came to think that the reason that we do treat each other with dignity—and that we ought to—is because of this relationship that we have with our creator,” Monge says, reflecting on her early explorations of theism.
Monge attended her first service in February, when she accompanied Porter to a meeting of college students at MIT. She was baptized two months later in the Boston Church of Christ, a decision that came as a shock to her parents. Monge chuckles, recalling how her dad suggested, “Maybe you could just wait ’til, you know, 2012.”
Questions of how and why her faith developed are ones Monge has thought about and been asked to justify quite often. In fact, soon after her adoption of the Christian faith, Monge wrote a document titled “Converting to Christianity: A Humbling Tale of Love, Longing, and Learning,” which explains the process of her spiritual transformation. It is published as a four-part note on her Facebook.
“I’ve heard many people say that the way to convert skeptics or intellectuals is to appeal to their heart, not their head. I think you have to appeal to both,” it reads. “This is a story I never thought I would write, but one that I will never regret.”
 The People
 “Jesus wept.” —John 11:35
The following year, Monge missed the shuttle to the quad. There was a girl—she turned out to be Tu—who had also been trying to catch the shuttle at Boylston. Monge introduced herself, and they decided to walk home together.
At this time, Monge was making a point of asking people about their religious backgrounds and, if possible, sharing her own story. When she brought up Christianity, Tu seemed receptive. The two of them got to talking.
“She just told me that one day she had lost an intellectual debate with one of her friends, and she was convinced that Christianity was true,” Tu says of Monge. “I thought she was nuts. Oh my goodness. I thought all Christians were nuts.”
This wasn’t the first time someone at Harvard had approached Tu about religion. Freshman year, Tu’s roommate had suggested (and suggested again) that Tu attend service at her church.“
I was pretty offended,” says Tu, mimicking an eye roll. “Her invitations had, at that time, seemed to me invasive, presumptuous.” After all, God didn’t exist. Tu knew that.
Yet the certainty with which Tu entered college gradually eroded over the course of her freshman year. Ask, decline, ask, repeat. Eventually, Tu decided she might as well try. After a year of resistance, she accompanied her roommate to Bible Study. There were two reasons for this decision. One, because she was such a great friend. And two, because her roommate seemed to have a joy and a peace that Tu felt was missing in her life.
“When I went to Bible Study, I remember not understanding much of what was going on,” Tu recalls. “I think when I actually started to explore the person of Jesus historically, to look at the historical evidence in favor of his existence as well as his teachings in the Bible, and to examine the manifestation of God in the person of Jesus Christ—instead of entertaining and developing my thoughts intellectually against an abstract God—that was when I made true progress in getting to know [Him].”
 God At Harvard
 “And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”—Micah 6:8
“It’s very hard to name the name of Christ at Harvard,” Tu says matter-of-factly. It is a word—an idea—that carries with it a tremendous amount of baggage at an institution known for its secularism. Students can be quick to judge, unrelenting in their critiques of Christianity. When Tu, a joint astrophysics and statistics concentrator, talks to people about her faith, she often gets skeptical—if not dismissive—responses. That doesn’t make sense. You’re a scientist or what? I thought you went to Harvard. Tu inhales deeply and begins motioning with her hands,“I get a little worked up about this.”
Tu is currently developing her thesis, which will examine the X-ray emissions from a supermassive black hole at the center of another galaxy, Ark 120. These emissions should allow her to infer the spin of this black hole. “Studying astrophysics is actually one of the most beautiful ways that I connect with God,” Tu says.
With such scrutiny placed on her faith, however, also comes strength. Being constantly questioned by one’s peers means that there is an intense intellectual rigor involved in practicing Christianity at Harvard. “My story is one of seeing the intellectual appeal of Christiantiy that would’ve been harder to see in a place that wasn’t Harvard,” Monge says.
“Maybe I just like the role of dissenter,” she muses. “But being in a community that predominately disagrees forces me to look at my own assumptions and challenge those as well.”
There is, as Monge explains, always an underlying question that Christians must consider: “Why believe in something that 80 percent of your peers reject?”
 Perceptions 
“One of the things that I worry about a lot is being misunderstood.” Eric, a sophomore, has on a dark grey Led Zeppelin t-shirt. He wears his blond hair cut short, and there is a delicacy to the way he gestures as he speaks. 
“A lot of people misunderstand Christianity—they misunderstand Christians. I think they understand religion in general a lot, but I think it comes across as a superstition, something you were raised with and a conclusion you don’t reach on your own.
“There’s a very real reason that I do it and it’s because I really feel that God has reached out to me, made himself known to me, and given me so much hope. He’s helped me to overcome so many struggles—he’s made me into a better person. So those very real effects that God has had on my life—that’s the reason why I continue.
“I’m a very shy person, so I don’t really end up having these conversations very much. When I do I’m often not sure of myself because I feel very intimidated by the Harvard atmosphere. I feel that everybody looks at Christians the same way, so I’m pretty quiet about it.”
 A Sense of Belonging 
 “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.”—Romans 8:16
“We were made for community,” explains Tu, who initially met many Christians through her roommate. “There’s a sort of bond that I never in my wildest dreams thought existed until I actually experienced it for myself.”
There are many Christian organizations on campus: Christian Impact, the Catholic Students Association, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Fellowship, to name a few. Both Monge and Tu belong to Harvard College Faith and Action (HCFA), an interdenominational Christian fellowship.
“The community in HCFA is one in which we love each other,” explains Monge, who also writes for The Harvard Ichthus, a journal of Christian thought. She looks to her Christian community for guidance in interpreting the Bible, religious training, and advice on how Christians should lead their lives. It’s also where she has met many of her closest friends.
“God himself seems to be holding relationships together,” Tu says. “Without God, human relationships can be really broken, and filled with a lot of pain.”
It is Friday and both girls are sitting at desks, in rows. The room is Harvard Hall 202, an ordinary classroom used as HCFA’s weekly meeting place. There is hugging, some chatter. The Bible will be interpreted, relationships discussed, and everyone’s faith will seem just a bit more clear. The room is academic and the classroom is ordinary but there is a sense of spirituality in the space.
 Religious Framework
 “And surely I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.” —Matthew 28:20
Downstairs, Wood stands at the front of Harvard Hall 103, head bent over an electronic keyboard. He has an angular jawline and bashful smile—the kind of face you would probably remember from a party. He moves a bit to the music.
 Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
The Harvard Radcliffe Christian Fellowship (HRCF), which Wood joined his sophomore year, begins each of its Friday evenings in song. These lyrics are an adaptation of Psalm 84:10.
Predictably, it is far more common for individuals who grew up in Christian households to have experienced religious growth during college, than for atheists to become theists. For these Christians, the beginning of college marks a period of spiritual development—one of re-defining religion in their own terms.
“You’re thrown into a new intellectual and social environment and have to really decide what parts of you are worth keeping,” he says of the transition to college.
Wood grew up in Florida—Tampa, then Jacksonville—in a traditionally religious home. He attended public school, was an athlete, and his parents were not part of the crowd that pasted “W for President” stickers on their cars. They did, however, teach him about prayer, Christianity, and Jesus. So, starting at a young age, Wood talked about faith, went to church, and thought about God sometimes.
“[Religion] was kind of this thing you did with your parents,” Wood says, going on to explain how he was never really challenged in his faith during middle school and high school. However, as he says, “Coming to college makes you decide what’s important to you.”
As it is for many college freshmen, Wood’s first year at Harvard was a period of exploration and, at times, isolation. He was confronted with college clichés—freedom, girls, beer—and felt the need to place his beliefs under greater scrutiny. “It’s very hard to live a spiritual life by yourself,” he explains. “It was just me and my thoughts.”
However, Wood found himself setting great value in the emotional vitality that comes with having a relationship with God. This, he says, was instrumental in his becoming more deliberate in his faith.
“As a spiritual person you have very different emotional experiences,” Wood explains. He pauses for a moment, looks at his hands, and then tilts back slightly in his chair. “Sometimes when I see the beauty of nature—if it’s a beautiful day—I see that as the reflection of God, the creator.”
He smiles as he recalls walking out into a snow-dusted Lowell courtyard a few weeks back. Rather than simply noticing the beauty of the scene, as he supposes most students would, Wood had marveled at how beautiful God’s creation was. This kind of experience, he says, fills with him with an ecstatic joy—one that he would miss out on in the absence of Christian belief.
However, Wood admits that college means that your faith becomes inconvenient in a lot of ways. This, he supposes, is why many students who grew up in Christian households let their religion slip in favor of classes, teams, social clubs, or partying. “It’s a problem of motivation,” he says.
“How I’ve engaged in the partying, relationship culture is obviously different,” Wood explains. He drinks, though in moderation, and maintains boundaries with his girlfriend that, as he says, “others might think are silly.”
These kinds of decisions are ones that students who are deeply engaged with their faith constantly have to navigate and evaluate in religious terms. “I think there are a lot of problems that people kind of want to wish away,” Wood says. “Christianity shapes how I interpret any moral landscape.”
 Transformations 
“I kind of just stopped caring, I guess you could say, my freshman year. I was like eh, whatever, my parents aren’t here. They’re not looking down at me.” A small cross and heart hang from the silver chain around Catherine’s neck. She speaks with animation. 
“I fell away from what I had been accustomed to in high school and throughout my life. I think it was really after a fall of sort of going crazy and doing my own thing—I don’t want to sound like I’m saying ‘oh people shouldn’t do these certain things’—what I’m saying is that for me, personally, I had a very strong sense of conviction. I felt guilty for the things that I did.
“It was really my spring when I started thinking about things: How does God play into my life? What does this mean? How is the fact that Jesus came and died for everyone’s sins important to the way I should live?
“If everything had been peachy keen freshman year, and had been going fine, I think that I would have continued on this spiritually stagnant path.”
 
 A Critical Approach
For students whose college experience has been marked by a religious transformation, there remains the question of whether their new-found belief will falter. Theism can always fade. “I think all Christians who are not intellectually disingenuous will say that, yes, there is some possibility that we could be disproved,” Tu says. Faith, however strong, is never certain. There are always gaps to be considered, always questions to be asked.
Yet this ambiguity is not necessarily problematic, and actively reexamining religious values does not imply a loss of belief. “Whatever mistakes you make, God is calling you back. I don’t feel like I’ll ever have such a damaged relationship with God that it’ll just discourage me so much that I’ll throw it away,” Wood says. “I’m very comfortable engaging in the critical aspects of it without losing faith.”
Both the intellectual and emotional bases for Christianity are, for these students, incredibly strong. Decisive evidence would be necessary to destabilize what has become a theistic foundation. “I can conceive of some type of historical document that would make me reevaluate my faith. But I strongly doubt that any such document would be found, or even exists,” Monge says.“
Given the current foundations of our faith, it would be very unlikely,” Tu explains. She pauses, hands still pulling her sweater tight around her torso, then adds: “It’s an intellectual possibility.”
However, as Monge notes, living in anticipation of some sort of change is impossible. Doubt, though necessary, becomes overbearing.
“I think at some point you have to accept whatever world you subscribe to. You can’t question it every day, or else you couldn’t live,” Monge says. “At some point you have to stop thinking and start living.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over a week after Israeli security personnel detained a group of Harvard students and affiliates, many said the experience gave them a small insight into the everyday tension between Israel and Palestine.
I think it’s one thing to understand the historic context between the Israeli and Palestinian people,” said Sushma S. Sheth, a trip member and a student at the Harvard Kennedy School. “But it’s another thing to wrap your head around the application.”
Some students said that, when being detained, they wondered whether the trip organizers were aware of the possibility that they might attract the attention of the Israeli military.
“My own views were a bit mixed,” Nancy Y. Xie ’13 said. “At the outset, I thought maybe [the guide] knew this was going to happen—was it our fault for inciting the Israeli military?”
While saying the probability of their detainment should have been low, trek organizer and Kennedy School student Ali H. O. Abu Kumbail said the region is volatile.
“[The detainment] was not part of the intention.... These things are not predictable at all times,” Abu Kumbail said. “This shows how volatile things can be and how risky things can be for ordinary Palestinian people and visitors on the ground.”
While he was not present at the incident, Abu Kumbail, who was previously involved with the Office of the Quartet Representative to the Middle East, contacted representatives from both the U.N. and the Quartet to receive confirmation that the group was permitted to be in the area.
Abu Kumbail said that the large number of people on the bus and recent demonstrations at the location may have prompted the soldiers’ concern.
Students said that even the soldiers, when questioned, were not clear about their jurisdiction when they detained the bus.
When a security car pulled up to block the bus, many members of the trek felt confused and worried about the situation.
“At no point along this journey...did I ever feel threatened, except for when the Israeli forces came,” said Blake, a member of the trek who wished to keep his last name anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue. “And it’s hard to not feel that way when they had fully automatic weapons on their side the whole time.”
Blake noted that several officers made physical contact with him and other students when forcing them back onto the bus. Students in particular noted the mutual concern for students in the group.
“What was hard for several members of the group was that while the Palestinians who hosted us...were worried about our safety, frankly we were worried about theirs,” Blake said. “On a regular basis, they could be detained arbitrarily.”
Blake said that, for him, it was important to keep in mind the Palestinian perspective.
“Imagine bringing people to your own neighborhood and showing them...something bad is happening to one of your neighbors—you’re not breaking any laws,” said Blake. “The army shows up, tells you can’t be there and arrests you, in your own community. That would never happen here [in America].”

Leatherback turtles slowly crawled along the Costa Rican shores to lay their eggs as Harvard students watched carefully nearby in the nighttime.
This year, three classes from the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department offered all-expenses-paid spring break trips for its students.
Twenty-seven students traveled to Panama for trips offered by OEB 51: “Biology and Evolution of Invertebrate Animals” and OEB 190: “Biology and Diversity of Birds,” while 21 students in OEB 167: “Herpetology” studied amphibians and reptiles in Costa Rica.
This year marked OEB 51’s seventh trip to Panama’s tropical coasts. Students spent each day diving into the water to collect and photograph specimens before bringing them to the lab for further investigation.
OEB Associate Professor Cassandra Extavour, who led the trip with OEB Professor Gonzalo Giribet, said that she hopes the trip helped students understand invertebrates and the importance of anatomical study.
“There’s no better way to understand biology than to get inside it—whether it’s seeing organisms in the wild or seeing the inside of a cell through high resolution microscopy,” said Extavour. “That visual and tactile element is very important in cementing the students’ learning.”
Diversity that had been enumerated in course lectures came to life for OEB 51 students once they strapped on their snorkels.
“The underwater topography was steep, and it was amazing to see the distribution and sheer diversity of the corals, sponges, starfish, sea urchins, squid, snails, jellyfish, [and] shrimp...,” wrote Emily A. Burke ’14 in an emailed statement. “The list goes on, and...it’s hard to just pick out a few favorite [organisms] or isolate them from each other because everything is so intricately connected.”
In Costa Rica, OEB Professors Jonathan B. Losos ’84 and James Hanken assigned their OEB 167 students the task of becoming “resident experts” in specific reptile and amphibian species before the trip. Throughout the week, the students shared information about their organisms as they encountered them in the wild.
“We get to see the habitats and microhabitats that [these organisms] are found in, hear them calling, [and] see them eating,” said Hanken.
“It’s a spectacular experience, and it gives you a much better understanding of what these animals are about than [the one] you can get just in lecture and lab,” he added.
OEB Professor Scott V. Edwards, who led the OEB 190 Panama trip, said he hoped his students “get an appreciation of how staggering the biodiversity is in the tropics.”
He added that by allowing his students to observe the neotropical birds in the country’s rainforests and mountains, he conveyed a sense of the urgent need for conservation efforts.
“Rainforest habitats are being reduced globally at a very alarming rate,” he said. “By exposing them to these habitats, I hope to encourage their awareness of how important they are for society in general.”

A Cambridge police officer was honored last week for protecting a visiting foreign dignitary against a potential threat at the intersection of Brattle and Mt. Auburn streets this past February.
CPD officer Stephen Lyons, a member of the Cambridge Police Traffic Enforcement Unit, was a member of the motorcade escorting Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh the night of Feb. 15. When three unruly males approached the motorcade in a threatening manner, Lyons said he acted in the moment.
“As the motorcade was approaching, one of the males raised his arms, jumped off the sidewalk, and ran toward the motorcade,” Lyons wrote in an email. “I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but his actions were certainly suspicious.”
Lyons restrained the man, forcing him onto the sidewalk—and away from the motorcade.
“I immediately checked him for weapons and informed him that he had placed himself in great danger by his actions,” Lyons wrote.
Lyons’ actions kept the motorcade on course, moving the deputy prime minister quickly along.
“Things could have gotten pretty serious pretty quickly, but luckily officer Lyons was able to step in and diffuse the threat,” CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello said.
Lyons said he has escorted dignitaries with the CPD for nearly 10 years. Officers like Lyons, Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas said, comprise the backbone of CPD’s dignitary protection service.
“Officer Lyons’ award highlights the close relationship we have with our federal partners,” Haas said.
The state department in Boston ensures that the protection of foreign dignitaries is handled by local police departments.
“A lot of dignitaries come to Cambridge to speak at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,” Riviello said.
Lyons was honored Mar. 14 at the Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill Federal Building in Boston and presented with a plaque. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security and Director of Diplomatic Security Service Scott P. Bultrowicz presented the plaque to Lyons in front of an audience of Lyons’ traffic unit. The plaque thanked Lyons for his bravery and his work protecting the deputy prime minister.

Harvard Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering Robert J. Wood will be one of this year’s recipients of the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation, according to a recent NSF press release. The award recognizes outstanding researchers under the age of 35 in the fields of science and engineering.
Each of this year’s recipients will receive a $1 million grant over a five year period to continue their research.
“I am thrilled to receive this honor and humbled to be in the company of past winners,” Wood said. “The support structure at Harvard is really fantastic, and my colleagues have been incredibly supportive throughout the whole process.”
Wood and his team were recognized for their work developing a technique to build millimeter-size electromechanical devices.
The technique is cheap and efficient, according to Wood. He added that he and his team are excited to explore new applications of the technology.
“We’ve come up with a process which is sufficiently generic that we can apply it to other fields like microsurgery,” he said. “This award will enable us to pursue novel topics in microfabrication and bio-inspired robotics.”
In addition to using the money from the grant to help fund further research, Wood said that he plans to use the award to help promote the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.
“We’ve realized that the devices we make here in the lab are fantastic tools to excite younger students,” he said. “A couple of my students have taken raw materials from our research outputs and created presentations for schools. We’re looking at the robots we’ve build and examining how we can further leverage them to promote [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.]”
Members of the Harvard community said that Wood’s talent as a researcher and as a teacher are major reasons why he was selected.
Michael Karpelson, a graduate student who worked in Wood’s lab, said he commended Wood for his strong leadership in the lab.
“He provides guidance without descending into micromanagement, and cultivates a friendly and cohesive work environment,” he said.
This praise was also accompanied by accolades from University President Drew G. Faust, who highlighted the relevancy of Wood’s work to other scientific fields.
“Wood’s research is an intriguing example of the growing interplay of biology and engineering, as well as the power of university research both to advance our basic understanding of how things work and to envision potential solutions to real-world challenges,” Faust said in a press release.
In addition to Wood, MIT Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Scott Aaronson has also been awarded this year’s Alan T. Waterman Award.

Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow recently announced that Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain ’95 and Suzanne Wones, the Law School Library’s assistant director of research, curriculum, and publication services, will take on the positions of vice dean of library and information services and acting executive director, respectively
These two positions were initially joined under the responsibilities of the vice-dean of library and information services, a role vacated by Law School professor John G. Palfrey ’94, who accepted the position of Head of School at Phillips Academy Andover. Their leadership at the library will take effect on July 1.
Wones will assume the role of acting executive director, in addition to her current library responsibilities. Zittrain, who is also a co-founder and faculty co-director at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, will act as vice dean of library and information services. Both will serve in these roles for one academic year, at which point the library’s leadership will be reevaluated.
“The HLS library is an extraordinary institution, and I’m excited to work with Suzanne and the staff on current projects and new ventures both within and outside the University as she takes the helm,” Zittrain said in an email.
Wones said that one of the greatest challenges in the coming year would be overseeing the library’s reorganization. While some divisions will become part of the University’s shared services program, the Harvard Library Innovation Laboratory, co-directed by Associate Director for Collection Development and Digitization Kim Dulin, will remain local to the Law School.
“Kim and I will be working with the staff here to think about how to shift some of the responsibilities and reporting structures as we go forward,” Wones said.
“It’s going to be a really challenging year with having the central reorganization, so I’m very focused on having our staff get through that successfully, having us all adapt to the new world order and succeed in it,” she added.
Zittrain and Wones will also expand upon work Palfrey began, such as the library’s open access initiatives, according to Womes. This initiatives are intended to make more faculty publications available in public repositories. In addition, Womes said that the library will encourage student journals to publish content online.
“[Palfrey] really put us on a good path for being a library of the future instead of one of the past, so I think we definitely want to keep moving in that direction,” Wones said.
Zittrain similarly praised Palfrey’s forward looking approach.
“John has pioneered HLS’s embrace of technology to advance the exchange of ideas,” said Zittrain in a press release. “Suzanne and I hope to advance his vision for the development of a vibrant digital scholarly and teaching environment.”
Zittrain’s new role will have him serving as the primary liaison between faculty members and the library. In addition, he will act as the chair for the Law School Library Committee, and as the Law School’s representative on the Harvard Library board. Wones will be responsible for all daily Law School library activities and strategic planning.
Palfrey said that he was looking forward to the work that Zittrain and Wones will do.
“I am extremely pleased to know that the Harvard Law School Library will be in such capable hands in the coming year,” Palfrey said in a press release. “Jonathan and Suzanne are both extraordinary and they will complement one another in very effective ways...I’m excited to see what they will be able to accomplish, on behalf of the HLS community and the world of legal information at large, in the years to come.”
Until July 1, Zittrain and Wones will prepare to assume their new roles. Wones said that over the next few months she will focus on learning from Palfrey.
“For me, it’s going to be trying to get as much wisdom out of John Palfrey as I can before he leaves,” she said.

Harvard announced a $30 million gift from Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 and Katherine A. O’Donnell on Tuesday. The gift is the latest in a string of donations as the University moves closer to the launch of a University-wide capital campaign.
Joseph O’Donnell cited House renewal and financial aid among the areas where his gift could benefit the school, but said that a final decision regarding its allocation has yet to be determined.
The University is currently in its quiet phase of a capital campaign that has been years in the making. During the quiet phase, institutions typically hope to raise a significant portion of their final campaign goal.
O’Donnell said he hopes that his gift will bolster the University’s donation count during the quiet phase.
“It’s an early gift and hopefully that will encourage others to give early, rather than late, and we intend to solicit as many gifts as we can,” O’Donnell said. “We haven’t gone beyond the quiet phase yet.”
O’Donnell is a member of the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and in this capacity is involved in the planning of the campaign.
Since the first rumblings of the capital campaign, people have speculated that House renewal and development in Allston could be focuses of the upcoming campaign.
During his time at Harvard, O’Donnell was what he described as a “scholarship kid.” That experience, he said, inspired him to give.
“There’s a real sense of payback for a lot of people who came a generation before me...who built those buildings and basically provided for the schools who admit students like me and that’s even more true today,” he said.
O’Donnell described University President Drew G. Faust as “spectacular” and said that her leadership gave him the confidence to donate to the University at this time.
“If the school weren’t the proper steward for all that money, I’d feel differently. If it had different leadership, I’d feel differently,” he said.
Faust praised the gift in a statement.
“A gift of this magnitude, at this important time in our history, is indicative of the leadership that has defined Joe’s relationship with Harvard since he arrived in Cambridge nearly half a century ago,” she wrote.
O’Donnell has been an active member in Harvard’s alumni community for years. In 1995, he donated $2.5 million to endow a chair for the coach of the baseball team, which he played on during his time at Harvard. He also served as a member of the Board of Overseers prior to joining the Corporation.
In the past year, the University has also received a number of gifts dedicated to continued efforts to develop “teaching and learning” at Harvard. Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser donated $40 million to this effort last fall.

Harvard initiated an open planning process that will create a new Institutional Master Plan for the University’s development in Allston at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Tuesday.
The Institutional Master Plan will include planning for the Barry’s Corner Housing and Retails Commons, the current site of Charlesview Apartments, and a re-imagined science center.
At the meeting, University officials and hired consultants presented potential development concepts and solicited feedback from residents.
Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that the meeting marked the “beginning of a conversation” about the IMP.
The new IMP will incorporate elements of the University’s 2007 IMP, which Harvard has moved away from since halting construction in 2009.
Harvard resumed development in Allston last fall after a year-and-a-half long pause triggered by financial constraints during the recent economic crisis.
Casey said that the new plan will focus on development during the next five to ten years—a marked difference from the 2007 document which outlined potential projects for the next 30 to 50 years.
Boston Redevelopment Authority Chief Planner Kairos Shen emphasized the importance of planning on a shorter time frame.
“The goal of this process is to take the most salient aspects of the [original] plan and extract from that those principles that are applicable for a five year plan,” said Shen.
Casey echoed Shen’s sentiment, noting that Harvard must be careful only to plan developments that the University will be able to complete.
“We want to focus on projects that are practical, relevant and provide tangible benefits for the University and the community,” Casey said.
The University hopes to submit the new plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority for approval this fall—months prior to its original projected deadline of December.
While Allston residents voiced support for the new document’s more limited time frame, some criticized the “vagueness” of the University’s prospective plans.
After consultants presented possible options for development, Task Force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said he felt that Harvard did not offer enough details for community members to provide productive feedback.
“What the University is presenting seems like a restricted version of the plan,” said Whelan.  “If we want this project to truly be a meeting of the community with Harvard, Harvard needs to reveal more of its plans to us.”
Shen acknowledged these concerns.
“At this moment, this plan would not be approved by the BRA,” he said.
But Shen also said that he believes the IMP will solidify over time and he urged community members to be patient with the University.
“This is a process and an ongoing exchange we are engaging in, so that by soliciting feedback from the community we can create a project that benefits everyone,” he said.
The University also presented more specific details about the Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons. The proposed residential buildings will likely be comprised of three buildings ranging from five to ten stories.
This announcement drew concern from many residents, who said that they were not expecting the residential density that such tall buildings would entail.
“I’m having a really hard time understanding why we are talking about such a dense area when Harvard owns so much of the surrounding land,” Task Force member Kathy Campbell said.
At the meeting’s close, Shen announced that two Task Force members, John Cusack and John Bruno, will serve alongside five University administrators on the selection committee for Harvard’s development partner for Barry’s Corner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Laurie Simmons, an American contemporary photographer who captures photos of dolls, talked Tuesday at the Sackler Museum about the unique focus of her most recent photos—a life-sized Japanese sex doll.
Her newest series, called “The Love Doll,” features the doll in different scenes, including a nude photo of the doll playing on the floor with a puppy, a photo of the doll wearing twenty pounds of jewelry, and a few photos where the doll is dressed as an authentic geisha.
“By using dolls, inanimate objects, I can get more quickly to the core of emotions than when using other people,” Simmons said. “I keep having to say something about the subject of a woman as expressed through a photo.”
Simmons said she has always been drawn to photographing dolls. After coming to New York City in the 1970s and briefly shooting photographs for a toy catalogue, she started using dolls, dollhouses, and dummies in her work.
Although she has focused on female subjects during his entire career as a photographer, she said her earlier photos connote themes of nostalgia and memory in scenes of domestic, middle class life.
“I have always been drawn to a kind of nostalgia,” Simmons said.
One of her more recent projects was a 2006 musical film, The Music of Regret. The protagonist, played by Meryl Streep, begins the movie as a doll made in Simmons’ own image. Simmons said that—unlike photography, which captures a single moment—film moves with explicit linearity.
“I never think about the story,” Simmons said. “I always wanted it to feel like almost a daydreaming, natural moment where people didn’t think about what came before or what came after.”
History of Art and Architecture Professor Robin Kelsey, who led the Q&A section, said that the new series “brings out all the erotics of the earlier works.... There’s a movement towards a greater life-likeness.”
Avery W. Williamson ’13, a visual and environmental concentrator who attended the lecture, said “these art talks are a great opportunity to get a sense of what’s going on in the art world.”

For the first time since its opening in the fall of 2006, Lamont Library Café will open at 9 a.m. instead of 3 p.m.
The Café will retain these hours Monday through Friday for a two-week trial period before deciding to make the change permanent. Closing hours and weekend hours will remain the same.
“These extra hours are based on student interest, so if enough people make use of the Café, the hours could become permanent,” HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin said.
Students said they appreciated the Café’s decision to lengthen its hours, but they were unsure whether it would be fully used during its new operating hours.
“I find it a nice experiment because I feel a lot of people will benefit from having the Café open earlier,” Diana I. Acosta ’14 said. “Lamont is such a central study spot that I think it’s necessary to have a source of food.”
Jason A. Y. Phillips ’13 was also optimistic about the possible change, but expressed different views about the hours.
“I think it’s good, but I honestly think it’s better if they opened it at noon,” he said.
But students also noted that the change might not impact all students, as students living further from Lamont might not take advantage of the new hours.
“It wouldn’t affect me much because I live in Eliot, but it probably will be good for freshman and Adams House [residents],” Jared R. Lopez ’14 said.
Other students feel that, although the new schedule increases convenience, it will not affect their own use of the Café.
“If it’s not wasting University money, it’s a great idea,” said Violeta F. Banica, a GSAS student, but added that she would not come to the Café before class because of the extra time it would take to check her bags in and out of the library.
Banica said that “[Café] Gato Rojo sort of does the morning job” and complements Lamont Library Café’s afternoon hours. The benefits of longer Café hours could help the students behind the counter as much as those they serve.
“I don’t know how profitable the early hours will be, but it definitely is a chance for students to make more money,” said one student Café manager.
The work shifts for these next two weeks will start at 8:00 a.m..
Mar. 30 will be the last day of the trial, at which time HUDS will “assess interest and decide if the hours change should become permanent,” Martin said.
In addition to testing longer hours, the Café is introducing one permanent addition—Starbucks Frappuccinos.
“That’s a nice new menu addition that may appeal to some folks as well,” Martin said.

UPDATED: March 22, 2012, at 4:13 a.m.
In the latest step to reverse the more-than-40-year exclusion of the military from Harvard Yard, the University announced Wednesday that it has signed an agreement with the U.S. Army to formally recognize the Army Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. The recognition follows the return of Naval ROTC to campus last year.
“This is a welcome step in the long and distinguished history of military service by members of the Harvard community,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement. “At Harvard, military service is rightly regarded as public service, and I am pleased that we can now broaden access for our students to the leadership and learning opportunities that Army SROTC training provides.”
As part of the agreement, Harvard will financially back student participation in the program and provide Army SROTC with access to classroom space on Harvard’s campus.
While students will continue to take their primary Army SROTC classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an MIT military science professor will offer office hours open to Army SROTC cadets on Harvard’s campus. Further, Harvard’s Army SROTC will have office space in the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Once the program moves into its new SOCH office space later this semester, Harvard will host a ceremony in honor of the agreement with Army SROTC.
The University welcomed the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps back to campus last year soon after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the policy banning gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military that Harvard administrators had condemned as antithetical to the University’s anti-discrimination policy.
Discussions between the University and the Air Force are still ongoing.
Members of the Harvard queer community have expressed concern that the University’s decision to recognize ROTC remains a violation of its non-discrimination policy even after the fall of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Currently, the military does not allow trans and intersex individuals to enlist, as it considers gender identity disorder—the psychological classification that describes transgenderism—and intersexism to be medical disqualifications.
Jia Hui Lee ’12, a former member of the Trans Task Force. said that the administration had invited the Trans Task Force to the official recognition ceremony for Army SROTC—a gesture he said he appreciated. But he said that he was still frustrated by the administration’s lack of communication during the process.
“I respect the decision to bring the Army in addition to NROTC back to Harvard’s campus, but I think the administration needs to recognize that that decision is a compromise,” Lee said.
Despite these complaints, Faust, along with Harvard alumni, remains steadfast in her support of the return of ROTC.
David M. Silverman ’53, a member of the steering committee of Advocates for Harvard ROTC, said he thought it was “a shame” that Harvard had ever expelled ROTC from its campus.
“I feel that universal training in some aspect of government service should never have been dropped,” Silverman said. “It’s finally going in the right direction after years going in the wrong the direction.”
Harvard Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen called the return of Army SROTC to Harvard a “welcome step forward.” Gergen, an adviser in the Clinton White House, has consistently praised Faust’s leadership during the transition.
Gergen had previously said that Harvard’s decision in 2011 to recognize NROTC would “likely...have a ripple effect across the nation.”
Since Harvard announced its official recognition of the program, Columbia, Yale, and Stanford Universities have all welcomed ROTC programs back to their campuses.
Harvard Army SROTC was first established in 1916. Harvard and many peer institutions expelled the program, along with the Air Force and Naval ROTC units, in 1969, in the midst of anti-military sentiment during the Vietnam War.
Since 1976, Harvard students wishing to participate in the Army SROTC program have taken classes on MIT’s campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has gained national recognition for his ability to recruit highly touted prospects for the Crimson. Now that the team’s season has ended, the tables will turn as other schools try to recruit the former Duke star to become their next head coach.
On Sunday, the University of South Carolina’s daily newspaper listed Amaker as one of three “realistic” options to replace the recently-fired Darrin Horn as head coach. The possibility of Amaker returning to the South was substantiated by college basketball expert Seth Davis, who tweeted: “I’m hearing that South Carolina has potential interest in hiring Harvard coach Tommy Amaker to fill its coaching vacancy.”
The Gamecocks went 10-21 this season and lost 11 of their last 12 games. The team’s 2-14 SEC record was its worst in 20 years and USC hasn’t reached the NCAA tournament since 2004. All of this is to say that the Gamecocks are looking for an upgrade.
Amaker’s name has been thrown around along with those of Shaka Smart of VCU, Gregg Marshall from Wichita State, and Tubby Smith, the former Kentucky coach and current leader at Minnesota, in addition to several others. Amaker has ties to the area after growing up in Virginia and playing as well as coaching at Duke University in North Carolina.
In other Amaker-related news, the Harvard head coach has been announced a finalist for both the Hugh Durham Award and the Ben Jobe Award—two very distinguished coaching honors. The former of these is given to the leading coach from any mid-major Division I basketball coach and the he latter to the top minority DI men’s hoops coach. Amaker is competing against 20 other finalists for both awards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beginning to build his own empire in New York, Jeremy Lin ’10 is looking to expand his worldwide rise to fame by extending his talents to the marketing industry through his recent agreement with Volvo.
This isn’t the first time that Lin’s name has been used for marketing purposes and it certainly won’t be the last (Nike has plans of introducing a Lin-themed shoe in the future), but it certainly bodes well for the Harvard alum.
The invitations to a press conference from one of Volvo’s US factories state that it is for the purpose of announcing “a dynamic marketing partnership with Jeremy Lin, the popular New York Knicks point guard” to push the “the Swedish car maker’s sports heritage,” and “help establish the brand with younger and performance-minded customers.”
Though you may not be able to find the link between a burgeoning Taiwanese-American NBA star and an originally Swedish car company, the business is now owned and operated by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and is looking to build upon Lin’s recent and potential NBA success.
"You may not immediately see the connection between me and Volvo. But both of us are striving to be better and smarter at what we do, and to do it our own way," said Lin in a prepared press release.
The values that Lin emanates and the values that Volvo prides itself upon (quality, design, environment and safety) make this a match made in heaven.
The Chinese company is looking to have Lin help with its upcoming international investments due to his unwavering popularity in China and growing popularity around the world.
The terms of the agreement between Lin and the company have yet to be disclosed, but the $11 billion that Volvo expects to invest in its Chinese factories is an illustration of how serious the company is about doubling its global sales.
As one of the few athletes with a car endorsement, Lin will be competing with Blake Griffin and Kia for center stage in the industry.
Though Griffin may have him beat in vertical and number of highlight-reel dunks, Lin’s strong international support may give him the upper-hand marketability wise.
Who knows, as a Taiwanese-American who is marketable around the world, the potential for future endorsements after this venture could be endless.
Lin’s commitment to excellence, performance, endurance and innovation on the court could speak volumes for companies that are in both China and America like Duracell batteries, Sony and Apple. After all, Yao Ming already illustrated the potential that an NBA star could have on international markets with enterprises like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola.
This recent connection between Volvo and Lin provides for a variety of potential slogans. From the simple “Looking good in the lane,” to the more complex “Quicker than you actually give us credit for,” the possibilities could be endless.
Commercials can also get creative. A potential advertisement could have Lin driving off into the distance with the license plate “ByeHaters” since, as a result of Linsanity, he’s left all the people that have doubted him from Palo Alto to Golden State in the dust.
But with all these ideas, we must remember that Lin remains positive throughout his career. The burgeoning star is already illustrating his gratitude over the Twitter airwaves for his new business partners: “Thank you Volvo for allowing me to be part of your family!! Praise God for this opportunity!”
The future is bright for Jeremy Lin with his All-Star lineup teammates and the upcoming financial gains on and off the court. But rapper Mike Jones said it best when he said, “ain’t nothing changed but [his] change, [he’s] going to stay the same.“

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team (13-1) is looking to continue its winning streak Wednesday night against cross-town rival Boston College (4-7, 0-5 ACC) at the Murr Center.
The No. 16 ranked Crimson has been red-hot rattling off nine straight victories, including the ECAC championship against Ivy League rival Brown, 4-1, and a 4-2 upset over then-No. 16 University of San Diego to win the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic in San Diego on the Mar. 17.
“It’s always nice to get a win over a top-ranked team to show that we can compete with anyone,” freshman Shaun Chaudhuri said. “But we know that this is a pleasure and a privilege to play and that we have to come into each match prepared.”
The Eagles, on the other hand, have struggled this season, dropping five of their last six decisions, including a recent 7-0 drubbing at the hands of No. 5 Virginia.
But the Crimson is not looking past Boston College, which despite its recent losses has played some of the top competition in the nation so far this season.
“We are pretty confident right now, but we also realize that BC is a good team and we have to make sure we aren’t over confident,” Harvard freshmen Alex Steinroeder said. “Our team has been playing at a very high level and everyone is contributing, so it’s nice to have that kind of confidence going forward.”
The Crimson boasts a young roster with its top six singles players including four freshmen. This group of first-years, consisting of Steinroeder, Denis Nguyen, Chaudhuri and Henry Steer, has been vital to the team’s success so far this campaign.
The trio of Chaudhuri, who has a 19-6 record this season, Steinroeder (17-6), and Steer (15-6) has had a direct impact on the team’s dominance this year. Harvard’s strength in these courts will put pressure on the Eagles, who have been shuffling their backcourt lineup in recent matches.
“It’s pretty amazing how many guys we have on our team who are willing and able to step in and contribute,” Steinroeder said. “It really helps to have the majority of the guys only playing singles or doubles so that we are very fresh for our matches. Even some of the seniors who had been playing in the past, such as our captains, have been willing to go and play doubles for us.”
The No.1 court matchup between senior Akash Muppidi for the Eagles and senior Jon Pearlman for the Crimson will be a highly contested competition, as both players have performed solidly throughout the season. Muppidi was Boston College’s first two-time all ACC selection and stands as the Eagles’ best hope for a singles victory. Both Pearlman and Muppidi are slated to compete in the doubles and singles portions of the contest.
These two squads share some history. In February of the 2010 season, Harvard and Boston College squared off against one another with the Eagles earning a 5-2 victory. Many of the players from the BC team two years ago are returning for revenge, including Muppidi, senior Alex Skinner, senior Jonathan Schroeder and junior Billy Grokenberger.
His last time out, Muppidi defeated Crimson co-captain Alistair Felton in singles play, Skinner fell to Harvard junior Andy Nguyen, and a Grokenberger-Shroeder pairing lost to Felton and Nguyen in doubles play.
There will be multiple rematches between these foes on Wednesday, mostly in the doubles competition, where each squad has showed strong play. As the doubles are played first, these matches will set the tone for the entire matchup.
“We are looking to bring a lot of energy,” Chaudhuri said. “We start with three doubles matches, so we look to carry momentum from the doubles into the singles. It’s our goal to show other teams that we are very mentally strong and that we are going to compete hard in every match.”
Despite being the favorite, the Crimson is not taking anything for granted.
“Our coach told us that every match is just as important as the last one and we have to take every match seriously,” Steinroeder said. “Sometimes we are the underdog, other times we are the favorite, but we have to make sure that we have the same intensity going in so that we can perform at the highest level possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s matchup with Boston College Wednesday night features two teams in a very similar position; both are talented squads coming off a pair of tough road losses that are looking to regain momentum heading into the heart of their seasons.
While the Eagles (4-4, 1-1 ACC) are clinging to their No. 20 national ranking, the Crimson (2-3, 0-2 Ivy) is attempting to avoid a defeat that would place it a full two games below .500 with a difficult schedule coming up.
“We just have to keep working,” co-captain Ellen Gleason said. “That’s what we did when we got back to practice [on Monday]—worked hard to prepare for Wednesday.”
The Eagles will provide another hurdle for an already battle-tested Harvard squad. Boston College has scored at least 10 goals in every game this year, and each of its four losses have come against teams ranked in the top 20.
The Crimson’s last two contests were both one-goal affairs that ended in its opponent’s favor. While it played tough against Penn and Johns Hopkins—two ranked opponents—the losses revealed areas for improvement.
“We lost those one-goal games because we struggled to put two halves together, and that’s a problem both defensively and offensively,” Gleason said. “What we’re working towards is to play hard from the minute the whistle blows to start the game until the very end.”
Senior attacker Jess Halpern agreed, noting that Harvard should be encouraged by its strong showings against top programs.
“We can’t dwell on the fact that we lost; we just need to go into BC and turn it around and know that we can play with these teams—a lot of them being top 20 teams,” Halpern said. “But we know we can play with them; we just need to finish.”
To come out on top against an offensive-minded team like Boston College, the Crimson defense must be stingy throughout and will likely need to key on two Eagles’ freshmen: Mikaela Rix, who leads the Eagles in goals with 27, and Covie Stanwick, who has dished out 12 assists on the year.
Stanwick and Rix were the number two and three recruits in their high school class, respectively, according toInsideLacrosse magazine. The pair has been catalysts for Boston College’s offense thus far and stopping them will be key for a Harvard victory.
In addition to stopping the Eagles’ talented freshman duo, the Crimson will also have to counter Boston College’s athleticism.
“They are a good, fast team, and we are just looking to come out faster and harder,” junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “It will be very important for us to focus on the draw controls and ball possession and also take high-quality opportunities.”
On offense, Harvard hopes to limit turnovers and simple mistakes. According to Halpern, the Harvard coaching staff has been especially focused on the fundamentals in practice to attempt to mitigate some of these mistakes.
“[We’ve focused on] little things like draw control and staying down on ground balls,” Halpern said. “On offense, we need to make sure we’re possessing the ball and not just forcing it to the middle.”
The Crimson will look for big games from co-captain Melanie Baskind and juniors Micaela Cyr and Danielle Tetreault, who lead the Crimson with nine goals apiece. Freshman goalie Kelly Weis will also play an important role in limiting the Eagles and keeping their high-powered offense from getting going. If Weis can limit Boston College early on, Harvard will have a good chance of pulling off the win.
The Eagles are 0-4 this year when trailing at the half, and 0-3 when their opponent scores first.
Wednesday’s game will be especially important as both teams look toward the NCAA tournament. The winner will have earned an important regional victory, an out-of-conference resume builder, and Beantown bragging rights.
“It’s the battle for Boston,” Halpern said. “It’s a regional game, which is important for earning a tournament berth. But every game on our schedule is really important from here on out. Our coaches are preparing us well, and hopefully we can pull of a ‘W’ tomorrow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t know what happened. I’m befuddled, to be honest. Maybe the Sports Gods decided that this was too good of a prank to pass up. “This’ll be a doozy,” they must’ve thought.
Or maybe, the stars just aligned. After all, the Mayans knew something bizarre was going down in 2012.
Because Harvard, Old Harvard, Fair Harvard, Stodgy Harvard, Hyper-Academic Harvard, is making the headlines in—get this!—sports. It’s crashed the front-page party, usually reserved solely for the Kentuckies and the Alabamas of the world.
But more than that, Harvard is enjoying what might be its best athletic season ever. All of a sudden, the Crimson is the King Midas of the Ivy League.
It all started in the fall on the gridiron. After being pegged to finish second in the Ancient Eight, the Harvard football team cruised to the conference crown, picking apart the Ivy League in record-breaking fashion. The D-Line held opposing quarterbacks hostage all season while the offense put up more points than any team in the modern era.
For Harvard football alums in the NFL, it too was a (Fitz)magical season. Before his team’s 1-8 collapse at the end of the season, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 led the Buffalo Bills to a 5-2 record, including a 34-31 win over the eventual-AFC Champion New England Patriots. And when the squad was at its peak, the Bills signed the former Harvard standout to a $59 million contract.
And in the middle of what could be a Hall of Fame career, Matt Birk ’98, the center for the Baltimore Ravens, trended worldwide on Twitter—he wouldn’t be the last Crimson athlete to do so—after earning his greatest accolade yet: the Walter Payton Man of the Year award.
As the Northeast cooled down, attention turned from the football field to the basketball court, and in 2011-12, the biggest story of them all came from the NBA.  Largely unheard of until that fateful Feb. 4 night when he dropped 25 points, Jeremy Lin ’10 became a national icon seemingly overnight and thrust himself onto the global stage.
Of course, that wasn’t the only major news coming from the world of Harvard basketball. After 65 rejected applications, the Crimson men’s basketball team was finally accepted into the Harvard of NCAA institutions.
It wasn’t clear the Crimson was going to make it into the tournament, and the culprit looked to be none other than the Ivy League Player of the Year, Penn’s Zack Rosen. In what likely would have been his magnum opus, his Rhapsody in Blue, Rosen took matters into his own hands in a shocking 55-54 upset of the Crimson.
But in a moment of sheer poetic justice, Princeton knocked off the Quakers in the year’s last Ancient Eight contest, preventing a one-game playoff and clinching the outright title and a trip, finally, to the NCAA tournament for Harvard.
This was what the Crimson faithful had been hoping for, the BB gun to their Christmas Story. And though it ended in a quick defeat, Harvard kept up with Vanderbilt. With its near comeback in the waning minutes of the game, the Crimson proved that it belonged in the Big Dance.
But even away from the national headlines, Harvard has had quite a 2011-12. Women’s soccer reclaimed its spot on the Ivy League throne. The perennially underperforming men’s hockey team nearly went all the way to the top of the ECAC. And the women’s basketball team, after grabbing second in the Ivies behind a powerhouse Princeton squad, won the Ancient Eight’s first-ever NIT game.
The Squash Gods also did their part in the gag and dropped two of the collegiate world’s finest ever on Cambridge: freshman Amanda Sobhy and sophomore Ali Farag, both of whom captured the CSA Individual Championships. Farag was dominant and did not lose a match all season, but Sobhy took things to different level. She won every match 3-0; before her opposition’s first move, it was checkmate. But that’s all in the past now. The winter season is gone. So, will these—can these—shenanigans continue into the spring? Has the joke run its course?
Or maybe, it’s not a joke at all. Is Harvard becoming—wait for it—a sports school?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It didn’t take long for senior forward Alex Killorn to take the next steps in his hockey career.
The  forward signed a two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday,  just two days after the Harvard men’s hockey team fell, 3-1, to Union in  the ECAC finals, signaling the end of Killorn’s playing days for the  Crimson.
“Thanks for all the  congratulations,” Killorn tweeted Monday after the signing. “Appreciate  all the support. Great day. Excited for the next chapter.”
Picked  by the Lightning in the third round of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft,  Killorn had one of the best careers in recent memory for the Crimson,  becoming the first player to score over 50 career goals in eight years.
A first-team All-ECAC pick this  season, Killorn tallied 46 points on 23 goals and 23 assists. The senior  also was an integral part of Harvard’s nation-leading power play, which  converted 27.34 percent of the time.
Killorn  signed with the Norfolk Admirals, a minor league affiliate of the Tampa  Bay Lightning, shortly after his deal with the Lightning and flew down  to Norfolk on Tuesday.
The  forward arrives in the organization as a highly touted prospect.  Boltprospects.com, a website which studies prospects in the Lightning  organization, recently listed Killorn as the club’s top prospect in a  March 2 ranking.  In the website’s 2011-12 midterm rankings, Killorn is described as  “really close to being an NHL regular in Tampa Bay.”
Killorn still plans to graduate in May this year along with the rest of his class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the New York Knicks played the Toronto Raptors, Jeremy Lin ’10 hit a game-winning three pointer at the final buzzer. And, on Tuesday night at least, Linsanity’s hot shooting was back in action. Lin once more led his New York Knicks to victory, this time in a 106-87 win over the Raptors at Madison Square Garden.
Lin, for the first time seemingly since February, shot a high percentage from the field, making six out of 10 shots for a total of 18 points. The Harvard alum also notched 10 assists and committed only three turnovers, a number quite low for the mistake-prone guard.
Lin received help from teammates Amar’e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, and Tyson Chandler, who had 22, 17, and 17 points, respectively. These four shot a combined 27-48 from the field.
With the win over the Raptors, the team’s fourth in as many games, the Knicks move one full game ahead of the Milwaukee bucks for sole possession of the East’s final playoff spot.
Interim head coach Mike Woodson spoke about the change that occurred on the team since former coach Mike D’Antoni’s departure, and the importance of this for the team’s playoff run.
“There’s a difference with everyone....” Woodson said. “I think that sense of urgency is floating right now and it’s got to stay that way because I don’t know what Milwaukee’s going to do, I don’t know what Philadelphia’s going to do and, Boston - the teams that are above us.”
With Lin back on track after an incredibly mediocre start to March, it seems that the only direction the Knicks (with a record of 22-24) can go is up. And, right now, that is just what they are doin.

Harvard has once again ranked first on the 2012 World Reputation Rankings for universities by Times Higher Education magazine.
This ranking, which aims to order schools based on global academic prestige, is now in its second year. The opinion poll surveyed 17,554 individuals, many of whom were academics, from 137 countries. Respondents were asked about the academic reputations of institutions, the quality of teaching offered there, and the schools' contributions to research.
With more than just a city name in common, institutions in the American and British Cambridge also ranked high for best reputations. MIT came in second, and the University of Cambridge was third. Out on the west coast, Californian universities also did well with Stanford and U.C. Berkeley completing the top five. Other Ivies making it to the top 10 included Princeton and Yale, which came in at seventh and tenth, respectively. A notable change from last year's rankings was the improvement of Asian universities across the board.
Oh, and if ranking by prestige rings a bell, we too were reminded of the 2012 Housing Market, where poll results showing differences between "overall" and subjective rankings illuminated the fact that reputation alone can make or break a House (or, perhaps, a university).

Just because the shows in New York are over doesn't mean you can't still enjoy a little couture. With events sponsored by The Harvard Vestis Council, Eleganza 2012, Identities 2012, and the SAA, Harvard's first ever Fashion Week boasts something for everybody.
The events began tonight with a showing of "The September Issue," hosted by Identities. Here is what's next in the lineup.
Vestis Council Blog Relaunch Party | Thursday, March 22, 9 p.m., Adams UCR
The Harvard Vestis Council helps its members pursue fashion professionally, linking them with experts in the fashion world through private shopping events and meet-and-greets. It also runs an online fashion blog that features beauty advice, trends reports, and fashion how-tos. Come help them celebrate.
Andaaz: A South Asian Fashion Show | Friday, March 23, 8 p.m., Cabot Theater
Maybe you loved Ghungroo. Or maybe you're just a kid at heart and get excited by bright colors and jewels. Either way, this event is for you.
Eleganza: Rent the Runway Trunk Show | Saturday, March 24, 2 p.m., Adams UCR
If you've ever shed a silent tear as you paid $200 for a formal dress—or if you've done that 10 times throughout your college career—you'd appreciate how wonderful Rent the Runway is. The website, which was founded by Jennifer Y. Hyman '02 and Jennifer Fleiss,  allows students to rent designer dresses for as cheap as one tenth of the original sales price.
For those who can't find time to come to these events, here are a few fashion tips from Anna M. Remus '13, president of Vestis, just in time for spring:
Colors
Have fun with colors this season and celebrate the warm weather in neons and pastels.
'Tis not the season
Put away feather earrings, headbands, and necklaces. And, while you're at it, also throw out your fringe vests, shoes, and purses. No more fringes and feathers.
Dress to Impress
With mini skirts, maxi dresses, and crop tops being trendy this season, remember to still dress for your body type. If you're more petite, a high-low skirt will help you look fashionable without shortening your legs.
