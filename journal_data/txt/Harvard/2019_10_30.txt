After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martin Scorsese changed Hollywood forever when he released “Mean Streets,” “Taxi Driver,” and “Raging Bull” in quick succession from 1973 to 1980. He paved the way for cathartic, character-driven violence that influenced today’s greatest filmmakers, including Tarantino, and his films have set the precedent for today’s pop culture phenomena — most notably, Todd Phillips’ recent film “Joker,” which borrows heavily from “Taxi Driver.”
Scorsese’s strength lies in his tenacity; unlike many of his contemporaries (with the exception of Steven Spielberg), he’s remained shockingly relevant today. He won Best Director at the 2007 Oscars for “The Departed." “Hugo” (2011) was nominated for 11 Oscars.“The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013) was nominated for five. With his latest film, “The Irishman,” hitting select theaters this week on Nov 1, and streaming on Netflix on Nov 27, here are Scorsese’s 15 best movies, including “The Irishman.”
15. “Casino” (1995)
It’s no secret that “Casino” borrows heavily from Scorsese’s earlier, arguably more successful works. But from an all-star cast that reunites Scorsese regulars Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci (in their last film until this year’s “The Irishman”) with Sharon Stone, who delivers a stunning performance, to the overexposed lens-flares that glimmer with the avarice of Las Vegas, “Casino” is still extremely watchable, even if it isn’t original.
14. “The Age of Innocence” (1993)
Incredibly understated and restrained, “The Age of Innocence” is a romantic dive into the debauchery of Gilded-Age New York. It seems like a detour from Scorsese's common fare of grounded character studies in the criminal underbelly, but “Innocence” is an involving tale of lust and mistrust. What makes a simple plot so compelling is that no one speaks their mind; what would be an otherwise straightforward conversation today is stretched to the verge of laughability.
13. “Gangs of New York” (2002)
Fueled by breathtaking production design and an incredibly terrifying performance from legendary method-actor Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, “Gangs of New York” is a sprawling epic that explores revenge, maturity, and fatherhood in 19th century mobster New York. The film is far from channeling the poignancy of Scorsese's best films, with an incoherent ending and sometimes inconsistent plotting, but it’s notable for its great set design and gorgeous cinematography.
12. “The King of Comedy” (1982)
A dark comedy that proved to be fatefully prophetic, "The King of Comedy" explores the treacherous depths of celebrity culture. It’s a haunting character study about the dichotomy of celebrity status: the hollow lives led by the famous and the hollow superficiality of the fans chasing validation from them. Robert De Niro delivers a fittingly bone-chilling as an aspiring late night talk show host, Rupert Pupkin, who served as a clear template for Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in Todd Phillips' "Joker."
11. “Silence” (2016)
A film that deconstructs religion, reconstructs it, and does it all over again, "Silence" follows Jesuit priests (played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) sent to feudal Japan when Chritisanity was outlawed in the 17th century. "Silence" is slowly paced and surgically precise — the film meditates on the existential state of purgatory, when one's prayers are answered with silence. “Silence” is beautifully shot, with cinematographer Rodrigo Prierto capturing the lush saturated greens of the Japanese countryside, the depersonalized gray wooden houses, and relentlessly vicious imagery of fire and death.
10. “Mean Streets” (1973)
With Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro in starring roles, "Mean Streets" is an introduction to the themes that has made Scorsese a mainstay in the film industry: morality in a hermetically enclosed world, religion, family, and loyalty. It achieves the most intimate atmosphere of his gangster movies, probably due to its smaller budget and scale.
9. "Hugo” (2011)
For a director who indulges in violence, it’s surprising to see Scorsese direct what's essentially a children's movie about the love of cinema. With captivating cinematography and all-encompassing computer-animated 3D, Scorsese makes the most of new technology from swooping digital crane shots that immerse viewers in the train station where the film takes place to a beautifully rendered landscape recreation of early 20th century Paris. "Hugo" is as heartwarming as it is inspiring, and Scorsese's irresistible love for the film medium is infectious.
8. “The Aviator” (2004)
“The Aviator” delivered on the promise of a great collaboration, one first teased two years earlier with "Gangs of New York,” between Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio who turns in an arguably career-best performance as business magnate, Hollywood producer, and aviator Howard Hughes. At the core of "The Aviator" are themes of unbridled ambition, solitude, and mental health, with Hughes' deterioration signified by Scorsese's gradually changing film stock from green-blue to RGB.
7. “After Hours” (1985)
Hypnotic and paranoia-inducing, Scorsese’s “After Hours” marked the legendary director's comeback to filmmaking as a fundraising bid for his long standing passion project "The Last Temptation of Christ." A thought piece on yuppie-culture as much as it is a modern, nightmarish, retelling of "The Wizard of Oz,” “After Hours” is as original as it is visceral and stands as one of Scorsese's more overlooked masterworks.
6. “The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013)
With flashy editing from longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, snappy dialogue from witty characters, and an incredibly comedic script, "The Wolf of Wall Street" crackles through its 180-minute runtime. There are easily 30 minutes of opulent Wall Street indulgence (from the yachts, drugs, and bars) that could be cut, but that's also what makes "Wolf" such an endearing project; it immerses viewers in an otherwise alien world of scandal, corruption, and cheating, and by its conclusion, there's little question that Scorsese is telling a cautionary tale.
5. “Taxi Driver” (1976)
"Taxi Driver" changed the film landscape forever as a thrilling, grounded character study of a Vietnam War veteran who returns to the streets of New York. At first, studios refused to show Scorsese's cut on the grounds that its violence was unearned and merely provocational. And although hindsight is 20/20, it's hard to imagine what movies would be like today had the film, and its admittedly bombastic closing sequence, never made it to theaters. Filled with nuanced emotions, and deeply socio-political themes of vigilantism, marginalization, and justice, "Taxi Driver" gave the role of a lifetime for De Niro and has stood the test of time as an undying cinematic classic.
4. “The Departed” (2006)
Scorsese’s electric remake of Hong Kong crime thriller “Infernal Affairs” arguably improves on Andrew Lau’s original. It’s about a policeman who’s undercover as a gangster (Leonardo DiCaprio) trying to expose a gangster who is undercover as a cop (Matt Damon). What “The Departed” does so well is balance empathy between its two central, but diametrically opposed characters; we both understand their motivations, and feel for their losses. The film also features Jack Nicholson as the patriarchal mobster figure Costello.
3. “The Irishman” (2019)
A powerful meditation on aging and legacy, “The Irishman” is in constant intertextual conversation with the rest of Scorsese’s mobster filmography. From the somber opening tracking shot that careens around a nursing home set to “In the Still of the Night,” that draws sorrowful comparisons to the legendary tracking shot of the Copacabana, “The Irishman” packs an emotional punch where “Goodfellas” can't. “The Irishman” could be the gangster film to end all gangster films, achieving what Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" did for the Western genre.
2. "Raging Bull" (1980)
"Raging Bull" is regarded by many as the peak of Scorsese's storied career as the first film to be entered into the National Film Registry in its first year of eligibility. It takes a deeply unlikable character, boxing legend Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), for all his animalistic behaviour, and builds a tragic character study. From the stunning zooms, incredible whip pans, freeze-frames and impeccable editing, "Raging Bull" often transcends its success as an effective drama and one can't help but appreciate it as a piece of cinema. With a sobering denouement that cleanses the sins of the first two acts, "Raging Bull" is an unforgettable look into regret and masculinity.
1. “Goodfellas” (1990)
Unforgettably electric and mesmerizingly immersive, “Goodfellas” explores the vices of the gangster life in a way that transcends genre expectations. The protagonist, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), is always an outsider looking in: He’s half-Irish so can never be fully integrated into the Sicilian mob, and nothing shows this character's separation from the mob better than an early scene where he is a child looking out blinds that look like prison bars. The film therefore allows the audience to directly follow the rise and fall of Henry Hill as he falls in and out of love with the gangster lifestyle. What was dramatically terrifying in Coppola’s “The Godfather” is strangely addicting in “Goodfellas,” with Scorsese also rolling out a romanticized soundtrack from doo-wop classics to ‘70s rock that mirrors the way Henry falls in and out of the mobster lifestyle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michigan-born actress Emma Brock plays the iconic Michael Scott in “The Office! A Musical Parody,” playing at the Boston Center for the Arts from Nov. 5 through Dec. 1. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Brock about her acting career, the role of adaptation, and, of course, her love for “The Office.”
The Harvard Crimson: When did you know you wanted to be an actress?
Emma Brock: I got the actress bug very early on in my life. I was directing my neighbors in plays and organized my elementary school to do plays. I eventually went to Otterbein University and got my BFA in musical theater there. I’ve been in New York City since 2012 as a professional actress.
I love life — I love the chaos of it, and the spontaneity of it, and just how amazing it makes me feel.
THC: What does this adaptation of “The Office” in particular bring to a show that people already love and are familiar with?
EB: I think this whole show is a parody — the TV show, NBC’s “The Office,” is a parody of life. It’s taking real people, and parodying what their life would be like in this office. And then in the musical we’re heightening, even more, what you’ve seen on the TV show.
THC: Who is your personal favorite character?
EB: I’ve been a fan of “The Office” since it came out in 2007! I was in high school then, so a bunch of my high school friends and I would get dressed up and watch the office on TV as these dressed-up characters. So I have a picture of myself dressed as Pam. I think young Emma really resonated with Pam, and how shy she was, but then how she kind of blossomed into being this really outgoing, lovable mother.
THC: How does Michael Scott change when played by a woman? Does his sense of humor change?
EB: I lean into the comedy as much as possible — like, in no other musical would I get to say these offensive, sexist things to women, except I do get to say it, and I get to show how terrible it is to say these things, especially as a woman. It makes it really interesting, and I think it just brings it to light. It’s a parody; I’m truly just a woman in a suit, and that’s what makes it funny!
I think one of my favorites is — we get Jan Levinson, who comes into the office, and she has come in and said, “Michael, you can no longer say ‘that’s what she said’ jokes.” And how we make it a parody is we literally make a musical number out of it!
All of the characters in “The Office” join in and start saying “that’s what she said” jokes, and Michael is forced to keep it in the entire time! And they are doing everything that they can to make him say it — puns after puns, it’s really fun.
THC: Does Michael ever cross the line? Do you see yourself in the adaptation as bringing him back from the line, or just putting him out there, in all his glory, and letting viewers make up their own mind?
EB: I’ve been listening to the “Office Ladies” podcast lately, and they talk about how, in the British version, Ricky Gervais kind of just went full blown — whatever is funny, and inappropriate, say it. What they really wanted to do in the American TV show is make sure that Michael has a heart.
So what are those qualities of Michael that we just really hold on to, and feel like, "That’s me. I was that person”?
I think it’s that he wants everyone to love him in the end, and he loves everyone in his office. He really does do what he preaches. In the end, Jim and Pam love him, Dwight is his number one fan. We’re on his side when Jan and Michael break up. He’s a really good boss and a really good friend to these characters.
THC: So do you think if Michael makes a sexist joke, it’s redeemed because he has a heart? Or do you put it out there and say — it’s still a sexist joke, but we can call that out and still love him as a character?
EB: I think the latter on that. I think yes, that is still really inappropriate to say, and not ok, but we see the heart in him and that’s what makes a complete person. We see these mistakes, but we also see the love in people.
THC: Do you see any of yourself in Michael Scott?
At times, of course. When he falls in love with Holly, and how goofy and silly he can be with that relationship, I see myself in my early days doing that.
You find nuggets of him that you really connect with. My connecting to him is that he wants everyone to love him, and he loves to make a little joke!

To the Editors:
Daniel Kim ’21’s op-ed, “On the Offensiveness of the Rising Sun Flag,” criticizes the use of an image of the flag of the imperial Japanese army and navy in a promotional poster for “Hist 1023: Japan in Asia and the World,” which we co-teach. We wish that Kim had reached out to us — or, better yet, enrolled in HIST 1023 — before writing his op-ed. He might not have changed his mind about the flag even if he had taken the class, but we expect we could have had a productive discussion about the complexities of modern East Asian history and the ways nationalists on all sides — certainly including those in Japan — have invoked that history, and the symbols of that history, to support their positions. We also might have had a fruitful dialogue about the extent to which students need to be protected from encountering provocative images during their careers at Harvard College. We plan to offer the class again in the spring of 2021 and we will be delighted if Kim joins us during his final semester at Harvard.
We also believe that context is everything in thinking about the use of images such as this flag. We would never wave it at a Japan-South Korea sporting event, where it functions as a provocation to Korean fans. We condemn those who do so. But we see a course poster as a different sort of speech act, comparable to the cover of a book. Probably the most widely read book in English on the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime, written by William L. Shirer (published in 1960), puts the swastika front and center on the cover of its many editions. A fine book by Michael A. Barnhart on the Japanese navy’s preparation for “total war” in the 1920s and 1930s emblazons the imperial navy’s flag on its cover. To say the least, neither book is written to celebrate the regime it examines. Rather, like our poster in relation to our course, the covers are intended to give readers an instantly recognizable image of the subject of the book. We believe that is appropriate.
Finally, we agree that the current conflict between Japan and South Korea has developed into a dangerous downward spiral of recrimination and retaliation, rooted in the history of harsh colonial rule that we cover in the course. Harvard’s Kim Koo Forum at the Korea Institute, its Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, and the Harvard Asia Center on Tuesday co-sponsored an event titled “The Perils of Populist Nationalism: Japan and Korea in a New Era,” that we hope Kim and other interested students were able to attend.
Andrew D. Gordon ’74 is a Professor of History. David L. Howell is a Professor of Japanese History and East Asian Languages. They are the instructors of HIST 1023: Japan in Asia and the World.

You live a comfortable life. Your food is cooked for you. Your halls are swept for you. Your toilet is scrubbed for you. You might even have paid for your laundry to be done for you, and for clean water to be brought to you. You don’t really have to worry about the heating, or the electricity bill, or the Wi-Fi. Admit it, you’ve got it good.
But don’t forget the cooks, the cleaners, the laborers, the drivers, the mechanics, the electricians, the gardeners, the building managers, the security guards, the mail people, and all the other helping hands that make your life so easy. Maybe you’ve been in their shoes at some point in your life, maybe you’ve only had a taste of the lives they lead, or maybe you can’t truly say you’ve ever worked a day in your life — to tell it short, it doesn’t matter.
Let’s stop by the dining hall for a bit. If your mother raised you right, you ought to be on a first-name basis with at least one of the dining hall workers, and you ought to greet them when you get there. Ask them how they’re doing today, and most will gladly let you know. They work long hours, ferrying hot, heavy, steaming vats of food back and forth around the kitchen — otherwise they’re blasting your dirty dishes clean with scalding hot soapy water or frying up your third grill order of the day. If you’ve never worked in a kitchen before, suffice it to say it is exactly the sort of work smug manager-types say “builds character” — a nice euphemism for humiliation.
But these workers are not humiliated by their line of work. Many of them are immigrants, and this job pays better than any job they might have found back home. One HUDS worker I am close with often tells me how her visits back to her home country put things in perspective for her. She is grateful to God for the work she has, because her relatives back home do not have it as good as she does. Whenever she visits, she spends a lot of money there because she wants her family to have a good time and not to worry about how much it costs. She also sends money back to her elderly aunt and mother so they don’t have to struggle to find work in their old age. From what I gather many of the dining hall workers, like she is, are proud of their work, and they deserve to be.
You, however, may be thinking to yourself, “Hey, I work very hard, you know. I spend as many hours as any of these blue-collar types and I’m training Bayesian neural networks via variational inference and writing about the sublimity of Chaucer’s narratological excursuses! I’m special and deserve to be pampered by those less talented than myself.” Okay, if I just read your mind verbatim, you can go pound sand up your pompous ass. But if you think my straw man is stuffed a little too thick this time around, I’d invite you to reflect on your own preconceptions.
How well would you say you know those who serve you? All the workers here at the “Harvard corporation” whose sole purpose for much of each day is to make your time pass a little more smoothly, how often do you realize you should be thanking them for their work?
Sure, you do work hard. But you know what’s probably true, too? You’ve spent your entire life working for yourself — maybe you’ll give back to your parents, your teachers, or your community somewhere down the line, but only after you’ve taken care of your own concerns. If you really think you’re tired, take a look at their dead-tired eyes and tell me you’re feeling just as low. Time spent on your education is different from time spent working at a job. Your education is really an investment (or, at least, that’s why they say it costs so damn much) — a job is somewhere you go to cash your chips in. Many of the workers at Harvard have a lot of people depending on them — children, grandparents, relatives back home — and they send money from every paycheck to make sure they are all taken care of.
Worst of all, their work, and therefore their time, is not for themselves, but for you, and sometimes just for the faceless Harvard brand. Trust me, they’d rather be with all those loved ones than be mopping up the remnants of your Friday night from the bathroom floor. So, if you do not treat the employees on this campus (local, immigrant, student, or otherwise) with the same basic respect and humanity you reserve for your friends, family, and classmates, you are actively dehumanizing them. Next time you see someone in a crimson jumpsuit leaf-blowing the courtyard of your building, look them in the eyes, wave, and give them a smile, if you can muster it. Thank them if you like. We all bleed crimson — you might even make their day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It doesn’t take a Harvard degree to conclude that American education changes in response to changes in systems of labor and employment. But one proposed change that might surprise is the so-called “60-year curriculum.” Challenging the notion of education as something that stops in one’s early twenties, the idea of the 60-year curriculum promises to put the “life” back in the “life of the mind.”
As the retirement age rises to levels not seen since the 1960s, and the number of jobs the average American worker has in their career takes a parallel leap, doubling for millennials as compared to their Gen X predecessors in the decade after college alone, it’s clear that economic change is mandating innovation in how we prepare students, both young and old, for productive, meaningful, and dynamic careers. While the liberal arts prerogative of intellectual enrichment as such remains an ever-relevant endeavor, today’s students need more than a one-time preparation for a singular career. Harvard, as a leader in education, must also lead the charge in exploring non-traditional routes to continuing education.
Let us be clear: We are in no way negating — nor have we negated — the value of a liberal arts education. The intellectual exploration and genuine life of the mind institutions like Harvard facilitate at their best is not only essential to the personal fulfillment of students but also an innovative and lively economic and social society. Still, Harvard can and should serve a wider student body and a larger purpose.
Indeed, a form of the 60-year curriculum has been championed by Huntington D. Lambert, dean of the Division of Continuing Education. In this vein, it’s worth noting that the Division of Continuing Education has done important work in striving to fulfill the needs of students seeking education at all stages of their professional and intellectual journeys, and we applaud its efforts. From the communal experience of the Institute for Learning in Retirement, which hosts peer-led seminars, to professional development programming that helps professionals to enhance and buttress their skills, to the Premedical Program which provides students who might not have had the opportunity to prepare for medical education in college to do so at a more advantageous juncture, the Division of Continuing Education has and should continue to broaden our sense of education and at what stages of life it belongs.
To the same end, we encourage the expansion of open curriculum projects that can make available the knowledge that we are so grateful to have access to. The online course provider edX, pioneered by individuals from MIT and Harvard, allows anyone to access material taught at the two schools. Many other institutions have since joined the initiative, which provides a mix of liberal arts-serving and career-oriented courses offerings, many of which are completely free.
In continuing with their important work, the Division of Continuing Education could also look at the ways other institutions have contributed to great social mobility, more so than many elite institutions like Harvard. After all, why isn’t Harvard in the list of top ten colleges for social mobility?
If rising movements toward lifelong learning represent a radically democratic impulse — one in which age is no barrier to self-improvement — then it will only be successful if made available to those of all backgrounds and socioeconomic positions.

Members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign walked out of a Monday meeting with University President Lawrence S. Bacow and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility to protest the administrators’ alleged unwillingness to consider divesting from the prison industry.
Members of the CCSR would not answer when asked whether they would ever seriously weigh divesting and would not provide details about how they make such decisions, according to an HPDC press release posted on its website Tuesday. The release said HPDC organizers left the meeting after administrators declined to answer further questions about divestment.
“The committee’s refusal to state that they were open to considering divestment indicates that their offer to meet was fundamentally unserious and intended only to give the impression of good-faith negotiations to the public,” the release stated.
The CCSR is a subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — that advises Corporation members on matters related to social responsibility in its investment decisions.
William F. Lee ’72., senior fellow of the Corporation, wrote in an emailed statement that members of the committee were committed to discussing divestment but that students were not.
“We came into this meeting hoping to have an open and candid discussion about the views and perspectives of everyone around the table, but unfortunately the student advocates were unwilling to have such a conversation,” Lee wrote.
He added that all five members of the CCSR were present. The committee includes University Treasurer and Harvard Management Company board chair Paul J. Finnegan ’75, California Supreme Court Justice Mariano-Florentino “Tino” Cuéllar ’93, and former Princeton University president Shirley M. Tilghman.
Members of HPDC declined to comment for this story.
In their release, HPDC organizers criticized the direction that Corporation members took during the meeting and called the gathering a publicity attempt.
“This meeting was nothing but a PR trick,” Divinity School student Ismail Buffins said in the release. “Harvard gets to look good by meeting with us. But of course, they’ll just dangle the carrot on the stick forever and ever.”
Lee wrote the HPDC organizers “demanded a yes or no answer” to whether or not the University would look into prison divestment and noted that the students would not answer questions about what the group defined as the “prison-industrial complex.”
“We told them we had read the report and we could not answer their question without a conversation so we could have a better sense of what they were seeking,” Lee wrote. “They refused and said they wanted a yes or no answer.”
In a report released earlier this month about Harvard’s investments in the prison industry, HPDC listed several companies they allege University maintains a stake in that might impact incarcerated individuals. The list includes private prison operators, like CoreCivic, and other businesses that in some way service prisons, like Amazon and Bank of America.
HPDC organizer Joanna C. Anyanwu said in the release that administrators did not consider their research findings at the meeting.
“It was troubling to see that President Bacow offered this meeting, but never intended to take the issue seriously,” Anyanwu said. “It is clear that they wanted us to seem reasonable by taking this meeting, but they never planned to really consider the implications of our research.”
Two days before the meeting with the CCSR, HPDC organizers also led a silent protest at a Harvard Law School reunion talk with Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82. Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal did not respond to a request for comment on the Saturday protest. Earlier in the week, HPDC hosted several events as part of their “Free Them Week” to promote prison divestment through a series of seminars, office hours, and workshops.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School’s MBA application rate declined by roughly 6 percent in this year’s application cycle, reflecting a decline in application rates visible at business schools nationwide.
Harvard Business School received 9,228 applications in the 2018-2019 cycle, compared to 9,886 applications during the 2017-2018 cycle.
Chad Losee, the admissions director at the business school, attributed the decline in application rates to a change in the school’s admissions policy in a blog post earlier this fall. The Business School held two rounds of applications during the past admissions cycle, compared to three rounds of applications in previous years.
Losee wrote that the Business School received 9,335 applications in 2017-2018 if the third round admissions cycle was excluded from the data.
“This is the apples-to-apples number to compare with the 9,228 applications we received in 2018-2019 without Round 3,” Losee wrote.
The Business School’s admissions office declined to comment for this article, referring The Crimson to Losee’s blog post.
The decline in application rates at the Business School reflects trends at business schools across the United States. The 2018-2019 cycle was the fifth consecutive year in which application rates have declined at American business schools, according to the Graduate Management Admissions Council, which administers the GMAT admissions test to business school applicants.
Geoffrey Basye, the Graduate Management Admissions Council’s director of media relations, attributed the decline in domestic applicants to a “cyclical” pattern of business school applications during periods of economic health.
The U.S. gross domestic profit has grown for the past 124 consecutive months, constituting the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.
“When there’s upswings in the economic cycle, there’s a perceived opportunity cost of leaving your job, and, you know, going to grad school is expensive,” Basye said. “There’s opportunity cost when people are gainfully employed.”
Basye said that increased competition from international business schools also likely played a role in the decline in applicants to American MBA programs.
“The United States, our data shows us it’s still the most sought-after destination for Business School — people still want to come here,” he said. “It just no longer has the market cornered, as schools continue to emerge in places like Spain and China and Germany and France.”
Basye added that concerns regarding American immigration policy also likely played a role in the decline in international applicants to U.S. schools.
Contentious debates over immigration policy have featured prominently in American political discourse in recent years.
“When you look at the political rhetoric, when you look at our current approach to immigration and how we’re distributing visas, our data says that four out of every 10 international students looking at the U.S. for business school have concerns about employability when they’re done. They have concerns about safety and security,” Basye said.
In late August, an incoming Harvard College freshman was denied entry into the U.S. by immigration officers when he attempted to come to Boston to begin classes. His visa was eventually restored 10 days later after administrators and his lawyer got involved.

Five tickets will vie for the Undergraduate Council presidency and vice presidency in the council’s November election, UC Election Commission Chair Perry M. Arrasmith ’20 wrote in an email Tuesday.
The pairs of students running to be the council’s next president and vice president, respectively, are Aditya A. Dhar ’21 and Andrew W. Liang ’21, Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 and Michael O. Raji ’22, M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21 and Case McKinley ’21, James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21, and Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 and Rushi A. Patel ’21.
This year’s UC presidential election will be the most competitive in the past several years. Four tickets ran in last year’s election, while three tickets ran two years ago.
Three of the five pairs include current UC members.
Mahajan has represented Mather House since her sophomore fall and currently chairs the council’s Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee. Patel — Mahajan’s running mate — represents Quincy House and has served on the council since his freshman fall.
Lowell House representative Larson and his running mate, Dunster House representative McKinley, both joined the council this semester. Larson is the vice chair of the council’s Finance Committee, and McKinley is the vice chair of the Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee.
Mathew is an appointed member of the executive cabinet of current UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20, according to Huesa, though he is not a council member. Mathew’s running mate, Leverett House representative White-Thorpe, has served on the council since her freshman year.
Neither Dhar and Liang — a Crimson business associate — nor Kumar and Raji currently serve on the council.
Each of the five tickets garnered at least 150 signatures from students supporting their candidacy, which is a requirement to appear on the ballot, according to election rules.
The official campaign period will begin on Nov. 6. Election rules stipulate that candidates may not sit for on-the-record media interviews prior to the campaign start date.
Students will be able to cast votes electronically from noon on Nov. 11 to noon on Nov. 14.

International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath returned to Harvard to discuss emerging markets, trade disputes, and other global economic issues at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday evening.
Gopinath, who is on leave from her appointment as a Harvard Economics professor, spent most of the talk discussing the impact of recently levied tariffs on trade between the United States and China. Economics Professor Jason Furman moderated the talk, which was delivered as the annual Malcolm H. Wiener Lecture in International Political Economy.
“What we’ve seen in the data is, for the goods that continue to come from China, there has barely been any change in the dollar price that Chinese exporters get,” Gopinath said. “The tariff is being paid almost completely by U.S. importers.”
Gopinath, who was named IMF Chief Economist in October 2018, also discussed differing economic growth rates in the global economy. She said she believes Latin America is the region that is seeing the least growth, while emerging countries in Asia continue to see growth rates exceeding 5 percent.
“If I look at emerging and developing economies and exclude China and India … their per capita growth for 2019, it was 0.4 percent,” she said. “There was an optimism that we would see much more convergence and emerging markets would be growing at much faster rates by this time.”
Furman concluded the talk by asking Gopinath for her opinion on Libra, Facebook’s proposed blockchain digital currency. His question comes less than a week after Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg testified about Libra in front of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee in Washington, D.C.
“When you think of a large organization like Facebook that has 3.5 billion users, [Libra] can have a very dramatic impact on payments and how people transact in the world,” Gopinath said. “So these are issues that come in of whether they have the right protections in place, in terms of customer protection, protections for money laundering, terrorism financing issues.”
Gopinath said she believes regulation is “nowhere near ready” to address these issues.
Phillip Meng ’23, who attended the talk, said he thought Furman’s line of questioning was “interesting,” but said he believes that the disparity between the IMF’s initial optimistic projections earlier this year and its current projections was not adequately explained.
“I think Professor Furman’s line of questioning was appropriately tough in really questioning why the IMF projections this year have been particularly inaccurate,” Meng said. “I’m not sure that question was completely addressed, right? Because that consequence is confidence in the IMF and its confidence in its projections. When 2020 opens, will we trust what the IMF says?”
Rundong Ji, a junior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, said he appreciated that the subject matter that Furman and Gopinath discussed could be applied to his research.
“I was happy to see that the IMF’s concerns are related to my current research topics relating to the labor income share,” Ji said.

Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said in an interview earlier this month that the College’s schedule works against inclusion on campus, structurally forcing athletes into their own isolated groups.
The isolation some athletes experience is partially a result of the course schedule, which has shifted later in the day and forced varsity sports teams’ practices to be scheduled later into the evening, according to Scalise. Those late practice times can conflict with classes and normal meal times, though the College has taken measures to alleviate the issue.
“When I was first coaching here, our student athletes went back, and they had to eat in their own houses. But the class schedules were earlier, so practices ran from 3:30 to 5:30,” he said. “With the class schedules pushing later, then you have practice schedules move later so they don’t conflict with class.”
The later class start times have led the Athletics department to fund one of the 12 upperclassmen houses — Dunster House — to keep its dining hall open past 7:15 p.m., when most other dining halls near the Charles River close.
Because athletes face similar scheduling issues, they often stick together, especially during meal times, according to Scalise.
“That's not ideal. That's counter to...people mixing and talking and interacting with one another,” Scalise said.
Nina S. Uzoigwe ’21, a former member of the women’s rugby team, said she spent a lot of time with her teammates because they had similar schedules and at times felt isolated from other students.
“Teams tend to be teams. They party together, sleep together, work out together, bleed together. So by default those people become your closest friends,” she said. “There is a sort of feeling of isolation but more of overlapping in terms of scheduling, especially for athletes.”
Scalise said he hopes to examine the way athletics fits into the larger college experience through the ongoing study of the Athletics department. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced the review in September; Scalise, who will retire from his position in June, plans to continue advising the committee tasked with conducting the review after his retirement.
Student input to the study is “essential” and the integration of athletes into broader campus life will be a topic of study, according to Scalise.
More than a dozen student athletes said in interviews with The Crimson that they perceive a distinct gap between students who play on varsity sports teams and those who do not. That divide is due in part to structural issues and stereotypes, they said.
John “Jack” W. Connolly ’20, who walked on to the men’s volleyball team, said other students sometimes stereotype athletes. He said people occasionally view him differently when he tells people he was not recruited.
“I think there can sometimes be more of a tension when non-athletes might — I don’t want to generalize that all non-athletes do this — look down on athletes as if they’re less qualified to be at Harvard,” Connolly said. “When I tell people I’m a walk on, it makes them treat me differently — ‘oh you got here on your own’ as opposed to a recruited athlete.”
But some athletes said that over time, the feeling of isolation lessens.
Charles J. Vaughan ’21 said that though athletes tend to latch on to their team when they first come to campus, that tendency gradually fades during an athlete’s four years at the College.
“When we're in the early stages of being here, we already have our teams, and it's like a natural divide of students trying to find themselves, and the athletes already [have] their teams,” he said. “By the time you’re a sophomore, junior, I think you feel just like anybody else.”

Five decorated female veterans of athletics spoke about “sports as a classroom” that teaches women life-long, professional skills at an event at Harvard Business School on Tuesday evening, drawing a crowd of around 500 people.
Through a panel discussion, Harvard Business School professor Debora L. Spar posed questions to three Harvard women’s varsity basketball alumnae — Attorney General of Massachusetts Maura Healey ‘92, Boston Celtic’s Director of Player Development Allison Feaster ‘98, and Jessica Gelman ‘97, the CEO of Kraft Analytics Group — and two Harvard coaches — Women’s Basketball Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith and Women’s Hockey Coach Katey Stone.
The panel, which brought together three players — two of whom were teammates — with their former coach, resembled a family reunion; in such a way, Delaney-Smith reigned as matriarch. Delaney-Smith, who is the winningest coach in Ivy League history, said her players were a testament to the power of sports in teaching resilience and leadership.
By playing sports, Delaney-Smith said, “you practice leadership every single day. You succeed and fail every single day...I believe failure is heels for success. When you fail today, you get up tomorrow and you try again...I think that’s the most incredible environment to learn about life.”
“These women are proof positive that sports is an incredible classroom,” she added.
The three former players on the panel reflected on how lessons they learned on the court applied to their careers after playing competitive basketball.
Healey, who captained the varsity team at Harvard and played professional basketball overseas, said that the far-sighted mentality of playing a basketball season came in handy when she was running for Attorney General of Massachusetts in 2014. In that campaign, Healey said, she was able to surmount her establishment-favored opponent by treating the race as a basketball season.
“What they [her opponents] didn’t know is I treated it like a season,” she said. “And so everyday I just got out there and got after it...Just like in practice, you’re going to have good days, bad days, ups and downs. But if you treat it as a season, which is what I did, you’re looking at where you get to at the very end. That was helpful.”
Failures, Gelman agreed, are part and parcel of not just basketball careers but professional careers too. Thus, competitive sports taught Gelman, who was honored as an Ivy League Legend of Basketball, how to have a work-ethic that would set her — and those around her — up for success.
In order to win on the court, Gelman became a student of the game.
“I definitely wasn’t the most athletic,” Gelman said. (In sprints during practice, she acknowledged that she was more often finishing with the posts than with the guards). “But I loved the game and I did everything that I possibly could...I used to eat with my left hand so I would be a better ball handler and shooter. I studied sports psychology at Harvard so I could be better in games.”
“What sports taught me is that if you put your mind to it, if you study, if you put your energy into it, you can teach yourself anything,” she said.
Players added that in addition to working hard to better themselves, competitive sports taught them how to work as a team to achieve a common goal — a trait that they continue to use in their careers.
Gelman tried not only to hone her individual skills but to put her teammates in positions where they would succeed. As a point guard, her role was to understand her teammates’ strengths and weaknesses.
Feaster, Harvard women’s basketball’s all-time leading scorer and a WNBA veteran, also stressed the importance of understanding others when working as a part of a team. As a teammate, Feaster said that she developed a leadership philosophy that was based in empathy and lifting up others for the greater good.
“It’s always been about being authentic and really putting myself in the shoes of each and every person who’s on the team,” she said.
The event was very much a celebration of women in sports; at the same time, panelists acknowledged the gender and racial inequities that persist in the arena, such as unequal pay in professional sports.
Despite these inequities, members of the Harvard Women’s Varsity Basketball team came away from the event with feelings of gratitude.
Sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy said that the panel helped her realize that female role models in sports have not always been as ubiquitous as they are today.
“Not all of [the panelists] grew up in a world where pushing for women in sports [was] the norm. They’ve done [such] hard work to get us where we are now,” she said.
Senior forward Jeannie Boehm added that the discussion reaffirmed to her all that her coach, Delaney-Smith, has done to elevate women’s sports.
“You don’t realize it all of the time day in and day out being coached by Kathy the impact she has on other women and that she’s had in women’s sports,” she said. “It was so cool to see her and the players she’s coached in this sphere. I feel fortunate that we all get to witness that power and that inspiration from Kathy on a daily basis.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an unprecedented move, the leaders of the NCAA unanimously approved to begin the process of altering current rules so that college athletes can profit off of their names, images, and likenesses. The decision led to immediate directives sent to all three divisions of the NCAA with instructions to update rules in order to be ready for implementation by January 2021.
Student-athletes will still technically remain unpaid for their athletic performances, despite representing programs that generate millions of dollars in revenue for their universities. It is only outside of the court and playing field where they will be permitted to accept individual endorsement money.
This is certainly big news, and its effects will be debated for much of the immediate future. But what does all this actually mean?
Firstly, this is not an immediate step. The NCAA did not declare open season to advertisers. As exciting as this news is, fans would be too eager to expect to see Tua Tagovailoa on a Nike billboard during tomorrow’s commute to work and the NCAA video games will not be available for purchase this year. The NCAA is starting a long and grueling process that is sure to have many more twists and turns.
On the other hand, this is a big deal. Never before has the NCAA taken such a definitive step towards any form of paying athletes. For this reason, we truly have no clue what we can expect to see. Will commercials feature college basketball’s rising stars? Will campus bookstores be filled with jerseys of that team’s quarterback? No one can say for certain. The only guarantee is that things are changing, and college sports may never be the same.
Despite these unknowns, we commend the NCAA for finally doing what’s right for student-athletes and taking the first step in modernizing the antiquated system of amateurism.
First, it is simply befuddling why student-athletes remain one of the few groups in this country who must relinquish ownership over their own identity in order to participate in an activity — one which quite frankly, is a full-time occupation in every sense of the word.
This directive in many ways provides student-athletes with a right of publicity that their fellow musicians, debate team presidents, dancers, and even journalists freely possess. If the rest of the student body is permitted to market their own image and brand in activities that may even be school-sponsored, why is the act of participating in athletics any different?
Some may say that most Division I schools — excluding the Ivy League — offer scholarships that appropriately compensate student-athletes for this exchange in image rights and zero on-field pay. The benefits gained through access to the post-graduate network and launching board for some into professional teams are other indirect forms of compensation, they say.
But possessing control over a student-athlete’s image during their time with the team in perpetuity, particularly while concurrently using that image to sell jerseys and tickets, is an exchange that has stepped far beyond what an institution can require of its members. The student-athlete can be under the purview and rules of its team while participating in that respective activity (i.e. playing for a scholarship, attending X practices, going to X number of press conferences), but a school should not be able to dictate how a student-athlete engages with his or her brand outside of the playing field — including commercializing on it.
Others may argue that student-athletes are different from those aforementioned individuals because of the enormous audience and dollars that are generated in college sports, particularly in football and basketball. It is because of the number of tickets sold and eyeballs drawn to these student-athletes that there even is a commercial value for these student-athletes, they may say.
However, we believe that the creation of external appeal should not mean that individual ownership of one’s image is somehow precluded. In other words, the right of publicity should be granted regardless of extraneous factors like a campus sports culture that may determine the relative worth of that publicity.
Fans have heard all of these arguments before. Media is finally unmasking the myth of amateurism, and the huge athletic revenues brought in by colleges are being pocketed by these academic institutions. Therefore, we believe it is time that student-athletes begin to finally reap some of the benefits of this convoluted system.
It is possible, however, that the more money injected into sports, the less parity we will see. The gap between big and small money schools is already massive. Even now, especially in sports such as football, fans pray to the sporting gods that Clemson and Ohio State finally lose games every week. Will the small schools be left behind? It will become harder and harder for UMBC to take down Virginia if the team is full of paid athletes.
So what does this mean for schools like Harvard? The Ivy League still refuses to even offer athletic scholarships. Harvard specifically is the oldest college in the country, predicated on its academic prowess. The Crimson’s 42 teams lead the country, and athletes here and at any other school will not expect to earn a “publicity” check for sports and events that are not as well attended as Alabama football games. The Crimson is not the Crimson Tide, and these changes are sure to have massive shockwaves across Harvard and the rest of the Ivy League.
While we believe that this is a step in the right direction, small schools could feel the pressure from the top. As a premier academic institution playing in the only Division I conference to outlaw athletic scholarships, it’s difficult to see where Harvard and its high-profile athletes will fall. No matter how this eventually shakes out, we do know one thing: college sports will never be the same again.

In the fall of his sophomore year at Harvard, offensive lineman Hunt Sparks began to catch his stride. Surrounded by a blocking group of his closest friends and teammates, Sparks’ course load felt manageable. The transition to fall season of Division I football wasn’t as jarring as it had been freshman year and he had earned some solid playing time.
“An outstanding player from the state of Oklahoma, big, strong, athletic kid,” said head coach Tim Murphy of Sparks. “[Hunt] loves the game of football and loves his teammates, a very high personality and someone who can lead… by his passion for football.”
As winter break approached and Sparks returned back home to his native Norman, Okla., he saw an opportunity to improve his fitness. But that was when things began to take a turn for the worst.
Two days prior to heading back to Boston, the then-sophomore experienced a 103-degree fever and prevailing problems with his kidney, forcing him to take a trip to the emergency room in Oklahoma City. While doctors were initially reluctant to allow him to return back to campus, he assured his medical team that he would line up necessary appointments with the team doctor and run the tests they requested.
Back on campus, though, Sparks struggled with his recovery and continuously felt fatigued. He labored heavily in making the half-mile walk from Adams House to the athletic facilities. Timing himself out of curiosity, the Norman, Okla., native realized it took him six-and-a-half minutes to make it down the five flights of stairs that lead to his room.
The following week, Sparks sat in the waiting room of Harvard University Health Services. He fulfilled the team doctor’s direction to get a chest x-ray. One of the nurse practitioners approached the lineman in a hurry and seemed agitated.
The X-ray showed spots covering Sparks’ lungs. Septic emboli, bacteria originating from a staph infection in the tricuspid valve in his heart, had spread throughout his entire chest. In his typical understated manner, Hunt described the alternative.
“Luckily, the tricuspid valve sends blood down your body and not up into your brain,” Sparks said. “I could have had a stroke.”
After more testing, he was admitted directly to the ICU at Mount Auburn Hospital. Head football coach Tim Murphy came as quickly as he could and stayed at Sparks’ side until his mother arrived on a red-eye from Oklahoma City.
“He went from 285 pounds to about 250 in about two weeks,” Murphy said. “It was really a scary time for his family, him, and for us. I went to see him every day and he would always be upbeat.”
Eight days in the ICU, 11 days in the step-down unit, and 60 pounds lighter, Sparks moved to Spaulding Rehab for two weeks.
“I couldn’t raise my arms above my head for three weeks,” Sparks recalled. “I couldn’t walk for a month. I had to relearn how to do everything.”
When he arrived at Spaulding, Sparks was unable to walk without the help of a walker, and left using a cane. His mother and father stayed with him on alternating weeks, overlapping on the weekends so the three of them could be together.
Returning to Oklahoma in March, Hunt continued his physical therapy. He started working out again, determined to return to Cambridge for the summer fitness program available to Harvard athletes who remain on campus.
“Everyone was talking to me like there was a possibility I’d never play again,” Sparks said.
This was a possibility he simply refused to accept. Although doctors were consistently surprised Sparks’ progress, his teammates quietly doubted his ability to pass the pre-season fitness test. Summer training was a struggle.
“I was finishing last on every sprint,” Sparks said. “By far the slowest at everything we did… I forced myself to come up here, forced myself to do the running and the workouts every morning.”
Head Coach Tim Murphy calls Hunt’s comeback “a pretty amazing story” and made sure to exercise utmost caution at every stage of his recovery process.
“[Sparks] just said ‘I’m fine’,” Murphy said. “I said, ‘I don’t want to hear that you are fine until the doctors say you are fine.’”
Without football and his summer routine, Sparks thinks he wouldn’t have recovered as quickly.
“I never would have pushed myself to get into the kind of cardio shape I needed, and I think that is what really made me have long term health again,” Sparks said.
As July stretched into August and pre-season football camp, Hunt finally saw progress. Sparks successfully completed Harvard Football’s full fitness test, the same test he ironically failed to pass at the start of sophomore year.
“The goal of just being healthy seemed kind of defeating sometimes because all you’re working to do is just live life,” the junior said. “Obviously, that was what I was doing in a way, but at the same time, I was trying to get back to the place where I knew I could be.”
Throughout his illness and recovery, one of Sparks’ most profound realizations was the strength of his Harvard community, especially the bond he shares with his teammates and the football program.
“The support of my whole team was crazy,” Sparks said. “Their support made it a completely different experience.”
Months later, Sparks has returned to the field. On September 27th, the 6’6 junior took his place on the Harvard Stadium turf, wearing Number 75, in a game the Crimson won handily by a 42-7 score over Brown.
The road back to the football field was a long one for Sparks, but a journey that tested his resolve, perseverance, and the fabric that ties the Harvard football team together.
Sections
Some of us bike or scooter around campus. Others walk from place to place, usually arriving a few minutes late (i.e. still going by Harvard Time). And others simply flake on commitments when venturing through the cold feels like too much work. There are plenty of campus transportation options, but Marwah W. Sabrah ’21 has arguably the coolest and sleekest one of all. Marwah has been riding an electric skateboard for three years and began using an 18-inch wheel electric unicycle a few weeks ago. We sat down with her to talk about, well, what it was like being so cool.
How did you get started with all of this?
I always wanted to ride a skateboard, and I wasn't really able to do it, because I'm really clumsy. But I had time over the summer at some point to just invest and practice. And I had already bought, like, the electric one, so it would be bad if I didn't learn how to use it. After that, though, I found it to be extremely enjoyable just riding around. Especially like around lakes, rivers, natural environments. It's very refreshing; it's very meditative.
Was learning how to ride the electric skateboard difficult?
It was a learning curve at first because I'm just generally very clumsy, so it took a while for me to get the hang of it. I think like, after a couple of weeks though, I was pretty comfortable and confident.
What about the unicycle?
So basically, if you want to accelerate, you have to lean your body forward. If you want to decelerate or go backwards, you have to lean back. And to turn, you kind of maneuver it with your feet. So that was a really hard portion to also learn, because at some point I was able to go in like, straight stretches, but turning essentially made me fall over to the side.
How fast does the unicycle go?
Believe it or not, the maximum speed on it — which I would never do because I value my life — but the maximum speed on it is 50 miles per hour.
What?!
Like, five-zero.
How fast do you go, then?
I would say I go like 35 to 40 miles per hour, depending on what the conditions are and, like, the general speed of other cars.
What else can you do on it?
People have videos of them hiking up mountains on the unicycles. You can like, ride it on the beach, you can go off road. They're powerfully, wildly strong.
You got this unicycle pretty recently, but if you had the chance to upgrade again, what would you get?
If I could upgrade and if I could afford it, there are these things that cost like twenty, thirty thousand dollars. It’s like a jetpack, but over water.
Do you have any thoughts on Razor scooters? Would you ever get one?
At this point, no. Size-wise, they're not like, small. They're not like, smaller than what I already have in order to be more convenient in that aspect. Plus, I think at that point I would just walk, given the speed difference of walking versus taking the scooter. But I do respect them.
According to Marwah, the electric unicycles are generally all sold from overseas, so if you want your own, you’ll have to do your own research on which model to get. Plus, you’ll have to learn how to unicycle. Good luck!
