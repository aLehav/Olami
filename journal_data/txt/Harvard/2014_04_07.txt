After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Everyone knows that Wes Anderson has a penchant for framing. Love him or hate him, his impeccably constructed aesthetics, both within and across scenes, have earned him Hollywood’s gold sticker as far as artistic perfectionism goes. But in his new, much-hyped film, “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” framing takes on a whole new meaning. A complex story within a story, the film is essentially a journey further and further back in history--and perhaps deeper and deeper into Anderson’s head.
 
A film with this many layers demanded, at least in Anderson’s view, a way to differentiate between eras at the level of the projector, so he actually sent projectionists around the world specific instructions for adjusting the pixel aspect ratios mid-projection with each jump between epochs. Adjusting pixel aspect ratios changes the proportion of the screen’s width to its height, a format that has changed over time since the advent of film projection itself.  Even this degree of obsession, though, is just the latest symptom in a long-winded obsession with stylistic perfection. There can be no doubt that Alexandre Astruc’s caméra-stylo rests safely in Anderson’s hands.
 
Auteur theory, in fact, is not an insane thing to invoke in relation to Anderson. In light of the fact that he usually writes, directs, and largely designs all his movies, you could say he is a student of Truffaut, and seemingly the antidote to criticisms by critics like Pauline Kael who emphasize the importance of the collaborative nature of filmmaking (though I’m sure Anderson would likewise attribute the success of his work to his hardworking crew).
 
Moreover, many of Anderson’s films are hugely inspired by the French New Wave. In a 2012 interview with Slate, Anderson linked the now-cult-classic “Moonrise Kingdom” (2012) to Truffaut’s “Small Change” (1976) and “The 400 Blows” (1959), but critics were also quick to point out ties to Goddard’s famous “Pierrot le fou” (1965), another story of a deviant couple’s escape from society.
 
But what these movies share is not, in the end, an incredible degree of stylistic control. It is an ability to create a distinctive universe. And this, I think, is what people talk about when they talk about the aesthetics of Wes Anderson. They mean the fine-tuned diegetic spaces he builds.
 
In “Grand Budapest Hotel,” Anderson took the task of building his world literally, employing teams to craft a series of miniatures that would comprise the eccentrically varied landscape for the film. But in his other films, too--especially “The Royal Tenenbaums”--Anderson took on the role of artist in addition to filmmaker, literally drawing characters and their worlds onto walls and storyboards alike.
 
David Lynch, too, was an artist even before he was a filmmaker, creating moving paintings that were often inspired by the Surrealists. Like Anderson, Lynch has earned his reputation for a distinctive aesthetic of dreams and disturbia that unites even seemingly disparate works like “Mulholland Drive” (2001) and the cult classic “Twin Peaks” (1990). An auteur, indeed.
 
And you can’t have a valid discussion of distinctive aesthetics without mentioning Tarantino (another disciple, by the way, of the Nouvelle Vague). Defined by his truckloads of tacky grit and bloodshed, Tarantino has consistently lodged himself in the brains of viewers--perhaps even in their dreams--with images of burgers and blood, severed ears and the radio. It is the close encounters of the gruesome and the banal that define what we will see when we go to watch a Tarantino flick.
 In the end, this kind of unique stamp on the aesthetics of a film comes down to a unique mold, whether it is dressed in a corduroy suit or high on three kinds of cocaine.

Yardfest headliner Janelle Monae’s forays into futuristic soul on her albums “The ArchAndroid” and “The Electric Lady” aren’t the first time a popular musician has crafted albums around heady concepts of dystopia and (occasionally) utopia. This week, the Arts Blog explores a few of our other favorite sci-fi-themed albums.
 
“Deltron 3030” – Deltron 3030 (2000)
 
Del the Funky Homosapien may be best known for his endless verse on Gorillaz’ “Clint Eastwood,” but this futuristic collaboration with Dan the Automator and Kid Koala is his masterpiece. Del’s dense narrative about a 31st-century MC who becomes Galactic Rhyme Federation Champion weaves around bleakly infectious beats, producing one of the definitive hip-hop albums of this millennium, even if it’s set in the next one.
 
“Moon Colony Bloodbath” – The Mountain Goats and John Vanderslice (2009)
 
This vinyl-only split EP was released around the same time as John Darnielle’s heavily biblical album “The Life of the World to Come,” and centers loosely on the employees of an organ-harvesting operation on the Moon. With its upbeat strumming and hand-claps, the album doesn’t sound heavy, but its lyrics paint a desolate picture of Asimovian ennui; the speaker of “Surrounded” sings, “I find a broadcast station that’s signed off for the night / And the static floods the speakers in glorious black and white / On my ninety-six inch television screen / Let me die. / Let me die surrounded by machines.”
 
“Preservation Act 2” – The Kinks (1974)
 
Skip the tame first installment of Ray Davies’ polarizing rock opera for this sprawling, stunningly produced conclusion to the battle between Mr. Black and Mr. Flash for control over England. Highlights include the tuba and clarinet-driven “Scum of the Earth” and the swinging “Slum Kids.” To be honest, “Preservation Act 2” is definitely no “Tommy” as rock operas go—one very confused listen might be enough.
 
“Crack the Skye” – Mastodon (2009)
 
Although not as aurally abrasive as 2006’s “Blood Mountain,” this recent release from prog-metal’s ambassadors has a storyline that the writers of “Doctor Who” would probably reject as too bizarre. A paraplegic flies too close to the sun, ends up having his soul transplanted into the body of Rasputin, and meets the Devil after failing to usurp the throne of the tsar. A true standout among the swath of Russo-Icaro-Hawkingpunk records released in the past few years.
 
“The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars” – David Bowie (1972) 
 
Over forty years later, the lyrics are still weird. Only the Thin White Duke can write lines like “So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls? / Just the beer light to guide us,” off the album’s sort-of title track. Fans looking for another way to appreciate this monument of glam-rock should check out Seu Jorge’s acoustic and Lusitanized covers of its songs produced for Wes Anderson’s “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“We must do better,” Harvard University President Drew G. Faust wrote last Thursday in an email to the Harvard community announcing the creation of a task force on sexual assault. The announcement came just three days after The Crimson’s publication of an anonymous op-ed detailing one student’s experience and the inadequate response of the administration.
“I convinced myself that if I pushed hard enough, if I made enough noise, someone somewhere would hear me, stand up, do something. But no one really did,” the author wrote.
Faust is right. Harvard simply must do better.
And while it’s significant that President Faust acknowledged the scale of the problem of sexual assault at Harvard, the task force must make serious recommendations that the University is willing to implement if Harvard is to improve. An endless number of panels and working groups have been formed to study this issue, with frustratingly little to show for it. This time must be different.
This task force can first right some of the ills of the current system by incorporating affirmative consent into Harvard’s sexual assault policy. This language would require a “demonstrated intent to have sex” from both parties, as DePaul University professor Deborah Tuerkheimer phrases it, in order to define the encounter as consensual. Affirmative consent simplifies what the Administrative Board ought to first be looking for when facing claims of sexual assault—the affirmation. The “Our Harvard Can Do Better” campus group lists the switch to a policy of affirmative consent as number one on their list of demands.
Further, Harvard should adopt a “preponderance of the evidence” standard for cases of sexual assault in place of its current burden of proof standard, which requires that the Administrative Board be “sufficiently persuaded” of guilt. The “preponderance of the evidence” standard, which requires just over 50 percent certainty that a crime has been committed to discipline a student, is currently the standard of evidence adopted by six of the eight Ivy League schools, and was endorsed in the Department of Education’s “Dear Colleague” letter in April 2011. 
The “preponderance of the evidence” standard does not presume guilt. What it does is abandon the unnecessarily high standard currently in place, which, instead of protecting against false accusations, has time and time again likely obstructed the path to justice for survivors of sexual assault. Adopting this standard is an obvious way the University can help remedy its dysfunctional sexual assault prevention and response structure.
Combating sexual assault is a community concern. All members of the Harvard community must do their part to be responsible and vigilant, especially at the campus’s social settings. Officials should ensure that that the problem doesn’t lie with poor administrative handling of these cases, especially in informal interactions with students.
By implementing these long-needed policies, the University can finally begin to improve the way it responds to sexual assault. We can—and we must—do better.

Brasil Timber Limited, Empresas Verdes Argentina, and Scolopax—these sound like the names of corporations you might learn about in a course on “Globalization and Agriculture.” In fact, they’re all timber plantations that Harvard University fully owns.
After suffering a huge drop in its endowment in 2009, Harvard Management Company, the subsidiary that manages Harvard’s $32 billion endowment, has sought ways to “diversify” its holdings. In recent years, this has meant purchasing and managing dozens of timber plantations in the developing world. Although these plantations have different names, local managers, and business practices, many seem to follow the same model. On each timber plantation, a large amount of land is acquired, cleared, and planted with a monoculture of fast-growing trees like eucalyptus or pine. These trees are harvested in a rotating cycle and sold to make paper or wood products.
Under the leadership of a few investment managers—in particular, Managing Director and Head of Alternative Assets Andrew Wiltshire—Harvard has expanded its direct natural resource holdings. Wiltshire used to work for the New Zealand Forest Service, which, according to a reporter from WealthDaily, originally developed the massive Kaingaroa Timberlands in that country. In 2003, two years after he came to Harvard, Wilshire orchestrated HMC’s purchase of Kaingaroa. Though Harvard subsequently sold part of the timberlands, it still made almost $87 million from Kaingaroa in 2011. Wiltshire also oversaw HMC’s subsequent purchase of the Big Sky Dairy Farm in New Zealand, which generated $4.4 million of income for HMC in 2011. Since then, Wiltshire has worked with HMC Chief Executive Officer Jane Mendillo to build Harvard’s investments in “alternative assets,” particularly timber.
Exactly how many timber plantations does Harvard own? Bloomberg News estimates that over 10 percent of Harvard’s endowment—over $3 billion—is invested in “forests, farms, and other natural resources.” HMC’s publicly filed IRS Form 990 lists over 270 companies as “Related Organizations Taxable as a Corporation or Trust”—corporations of which Harvard owns 50 percent or more—and dozens of those hold timberland. As well as New Zealand, Harvard has large timber holdings in Brazil, Romania, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay. 
Unfortunately, Harvard does not have the best track record for responsible management of these plantations. Last year, the Chilean government sued Harvard’s Agrícola Brinzal for felling 189 acres of native forest and then reforesting with a foreign tree species, eucalyptus. This past winter, Romanian authorities arrested a former contractor for Scolopax, a Harvard-owned company that used to be the largest private owner of forests in Romania, on charges of corruption and bribery; Scolopax put its land up for sale immediately afterward. 
Some climate activists and researchers have suggested that sustainable forestry could actually help absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating the destructive effects of climate change. I’m not convinced that large-scale planting of eucalyptus trees in Latin America could ever be good for local ecologies.
Yet those concerned about responsible investment at Harvard need not demand that Harvard divest from its timber holdings. After all, as a majority or full owner of these companies, Harvard could ensure sustainable forestry practices across the world—if it made a commitment to responsible ownership.
How will we know whether Harvard’s timber plantations are responsibly managed? Many are already certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, an independent nonprofit that purports to identify responsibly managed forests. EVASA, one of two Harvard-owned timber plantations in Corrientes, Argentina, is certified by the FSC, but this standard means little in the grasslands of Argentina. According to a report published by the Oakland Institute and Responsible Investment at Harvard last fall, “One worker told the research team that [EVASA] portray[s] an unrealistic image of its operations: ‘They know when they are going to come 15 to 20 days beforehand, and they clean everything up; they leave it looking perfect… [T]hey hide the trucks without safety belts when the inspectors come.’”
Perhaps a better way to certify the responsible management of timber plantations is to listen to the voices of those most affected by forestry. This week, two residents of Corrientes, Argentina will be on Harvard’s campus to explain the destructive effects of Harvard’s companies Las Misiones and EVASA on small farmers and rural communities. One, an organizer with Guardianes del Iberá, will speak to the effects of Harvard’s plantations on the Iberá Wetlands. Another, Adrían Obregon, a farmer and representative of the local small producers’ association, knows about the impact Harvard’s plantations have on the farmers they displace: As he noted in a video about Harvard in Iberá, “Without land, we cannot produce. And if we’re not producing, there’s no food. And if there’s no food, there's no life.”
Responsible management of these plantations could start by removing plantations within 2,000 meters of homes, following local labor laws, and completing a participatory study of environmental and social impacts.
Harvard could continue to cut corners, sacrificing native forests, subsistence farmers’ land, and ecological well-being in its efforts to turn a profit. Or, it could use its timberland assets to push forward a sustainable model for global forestry. I hope Harvard takes seriously its “commitment to sustainable investment” and that its “distinctive responsibilities to society” lead it to responsible ownership.

I still vividly remember November 4, 2008, the night Barack Obama was first elected president. I smiled and cheered as I watched history unfold on TV. It seemed almost surreal, like somebody who exemplified the ideals I held had conveniently arrived to lead the way forward. Change, as far as I could tell, was finally here.
Six years later, though, I can’t help but think I got caught up in the cult of the celebrity politician. I, like the majority of my peers, feel somewhat disillusioned with politics. That’s not only because of Obama. Lately, I’ve felt an eerie sense of déjà vu, as I’ve seen a similar political story play out again and again throughout the past few months. 
It’s a familiar narrative: A rising star emerges who rapidly captures the national spotlight. We fixate on these politicians just as we do on Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber, initially charmed by their new and exciting personalities. And therein lies the problem. If nothing else, these apparent stars are almost invariably bound to fall short of our inflated expectations. More troublingly, though, a politician’s celebrity can easily overshadow the expectation for actual substance—a preoccupation with appearing to govern well can interfere with actually governing well.
About four years ago, I came across a then-relatively unknown mayor named Cory Booker. I began learning about him from Wikipedia—Stanford, Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law School. I read his eloquent writings and watched his moving commencement speeches, replete with beautiful quotes from Langston Hughes. I soon enthusiastically liked his Facebook page, and over the years, I heard of his “superhero” feats shoveling snow for constituents and saving neighbors from burning buildings in his city of Newark, New Jersey.
Booker quickly became nationally famous as a young and talented social media mayor. I was impressed. When Booker ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2013, I was among those who smiled and cheered, just as I did for Obama in 2008.
But as I was recently reminded, stardom can come at the cost of effective governance. The Newark-based Star-Ledger newspaper reported that in an 18-month period, Booker was out of state 21.7 percent of the time, making him an “absentee mayor.” This is probably in part because Booker, while still mayor, founded a New York-based tech startup in 2012, drawing on his influence with Silicon Valley leaders. Certainly, Booker’s national reach brought attention and resources to Newark, at least temporarily. However, it seems now as if Booker’s tenure was much more style than substance—today, he leaves behind revelations of major corruption and lack of oversight in his administration, along with a still-struggling city. As Columbia economist and former Booker finance director Brendan O’Flaherty put it, “He became a celebrity instead of a mayor.”
This same fetish for political celebrity drives the media frenzy surrounding Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey. Until recently, Christie was widely regarded as the Republican 2016 presidential frontrunner, praised as a dynamic leader focused on “achieving results” while his state ranked 47th in GDP growth with record poverty levels and high unemployment. This is, of course, not to mention the infamous “Bridgegate” scandal. Christie rightly seems in contention for the title of “America’s most overrated governor.”
We are obsessed with Christie not for any particularly distinguished performance as governor but because we like the pragmatic, street-fighter persona he has cultivated. I have to admit I found it pretty appealing. In retrospect, I feel embarrassed.
Of course, this phenomenon is by no means limited to two politicians from New Jersey. Ted Cruz’s meaningless but headline-grabbing Obamacare filibuster was fundamentally no different from the cults of personality Booker and Christie cultivated, and Cruz’s actions contribute to the same, broad disillusionment with politics. As long we remain infatuated with rockstars of political self-promotion, we will inevitably be disappointed. Just as we lose interest in celebrities, we lose interest in celebrity politicians. And just as we elevate celebrities and then complain when they disappoint, so, too, do we worship and later condemn politicians.
In an interview shortly after his election to the Senate, Booker optimistically proclaimed, “Well, we cannot afford to surrender to cynicism.” To be honest, though, it is somewhat difficult to resist cynicism in an era where appearance seems to supersede any tangible record of governance.
I unliked Cory Booker on Facebook a few weeks ago. It just felt too disingenuous to follow his page and see the various inspirational posts of the day, knowing that I was no longer quite sure what to think of them. I got too caught up with the superhero mystique to look a bit deeper and wait before latching on to a fad. In essence, I imagined a political ideal probably too good to be true.
I think now I’m done with celebrity politicians, I’m done assigning lofty expectations to people I hear about based on some ephemeral sense of charisma. I’ve been let down enough times that I’ve learned the old saying “buyer beware.” 
Or at least, until the next guy comes along.

“Of course, that never happens in our government today,” my professor quipped while discussing the role of corruption in the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Many in the class laughed. We knew that, just as in the crumbling empire of the fifth century, the few, wealthy elites of this country exert an inordinate amount of influence on American politics.
And last week, the situation only got worse.
On the same day that my professor made his remark, two things happened that intensified the comment’s horrifying irony. The Supreme Court struck down limitations on total campaign contributions, and Chairman of the House Budget Committee Rep. Paul Ryan released his new proposed congressional budget for 2015.
The Supreme Court ruled in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case that a total cap on individual contributions to political candidates in an election cycle violates the First Amendment right to free speech. While the limit of contributions to any given candidate remains set at $2,600, an individual may now contribute up to $2,600 to as many candidates as desired, leading to possible campaign contributions up to “the number infinity,” as dissenting Justice Breyer put it.
This ruling comes four years after the momentous Citizens United decision that led to the rise of super PACs and a massive influx of money, notably from wealthy and potentially anonymous donors, into the election process. The McCutcheon case will only lead to an even greater influence of money—and those who have lots of it—on the political decisions that affect every American citizen. These two rulings signal the rapid expansion of an already-growing American plutocracy, in which politicians care more about what the rich have to say, because the rich have increasingly greater power in determining who ends up in office.
Conservatives have justified the Citizens United and McCutcheon rulings through the argument that campaign contributions are an exercise of free speech. This idea has often been simplified as the slogan, “Money is speech.” However, that understanding is too simple. More appropriate would be “Money buys speech.”
Money is used as a means by which donors amplify the relative magnitude of their voices. The problem is that, if money buys speech in politics, then speech is no longer free. It has a price—and that price is very high.
The average citizen cannot compete with the likes of Sheldon Adelson, who spent at least $98 million on Republican candidates in 2012. Already, several 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls journeyed to a convention in Las Vegas last month to court his support. 
A good democracy demands that the average citizen have just as much say as a wealthy one. But if the people cannot afford speech commensurate with that of megadonors, then what little speech they do have becomes essentially worthless in affecting the political dialogue of the nation.
Unsurprisingly, much of the political dialogue of the nation currently benefits the wealthy. Time and again, the current Republican-controlled House has done everything in its power to cut taxes on the rich, while simultaneously decimating funding for social safety programs that benefit America’s most vulnerable people.
Paul Ryan’s new budget proposal, incredibly titled “The Path to Prosperity,” would cut to the bone a wide range of government-funded programs, from education to health care, that primarily benefit lower and middle class families. These economically unjust proposals are part of a bill that also includes a cut of the top marginal tax rate from 39.6 percent (already low by the standards of the last hundred years) to 25 percent. This bill, which is similar to previous proposals that were condemned by expert after expert as economically unsound, would also increase the national deficit.
A budget that benefits the wealthy at such a staggering cost to the rest of the nation is to be expected given the enormous contributions of wealthy donors to conservative PACs. The rich—such as the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and several others—have essentially come to dictate the path of the Republican Party, a path that caters to them and the rest of the economic elite.
The similarities between American politics now and Western Roman politics in the fifth century are truly unsettling. In both cases, the wealthy acquired astonishing sway over a government without enough money to adequately care for its average citizens, and they used that influence to protect, and even increase, their own wealth. I do not believe that America is about to go the way of the Western Roman Empire; we do not face all the same challenges that led to the demise of Rome. Nevertheless, only a fool fails to learn from history, and the lesson here is clear: A government controlled by self-serving plutocrats is not in the best interests of the nation.
The Western Roman Empire fell in the year 476 A.D., but the Eastern Roman Empire—governed by a meritocratic bureaucracy that avoided dominance by plutocrats—lived on for almost another thousand years, until the year 1453. After the fall of the West, the East experienced a rejuvenation, reconquering much of empire’s lost territory, producing the Code of Justinian on which western legal tradition is largely based, and constructing one of the greatest architectural marvels in the world, the Hagia Sophia.
America can continue on the road to plutocracy, or it can uphold principles of good governance. We can choose decline, like Rome, or renewal, like Constantinople.

Sir Alex C. Ferguson will bring his 26 years of coaching and managing experience at Manchester United Football Club to the Harvard Business School this spring as a teacher for its Executive Education program, the school announced Thursday.
The 72-year-old retired manager will begin his tenure as a lecturer in the new “Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports” program taking place from May 7-10. In his new role, Ferguson will lecture to senior executives from around the world, providing insight into his successful strategies as a coach and leader.
The HBS Executive Education program includes over 80 open-enrollment and 60 custom classes, attended by over 9,700 business executives last year.
Ferguson is the most successful manager in English Premier League history. Over the course of nearly three decades, he helped lead Man. U. to 38 trophies, including 13 league titles and two UEFA Champions League titles.
Ferguson’s arrival comes nearly a year after his announced retirement from his managing position. This will not be his first time at Harvard—during his time as the longest serving manager in Man. U. history, he became familiar with the campus after taking a tour of the Yard in 2011 with his team when they visited America to play the New England Revolution in Gillette Stadium. Additionally, Business School professor Anita Elberse released an in-depth case study last year called “Sir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United.” Following the report, Ferguson visited Harvard as a guest professor for several of Elberse’s classes.
Elberse expressed excitement at the opportunity to reunite with Ferguson in the upcoming months.
“We look forward to welcoming Sir Alex Ferguson on the HBS campus to share his remarkable leadership journey, and contribute to our Executive Education participants’ ability to make a profound difference in the world,” Elberse said in a press release about his appointment.
Ferguson echoed Elberse’s excitement about the opportunity in the press release.
“I’m delighted to have the opportunity and privilege to contribute to such a respected center of excellence,” Ferguson said. “The time I have already spent at Harvard has been a stimulating experience and I look forward to developing my relationship and activities with the students, faculty and friends of the Harvard Business School community.”

Now that the extended March 31 deadline to enroll in a health care plan through the Affordable Care Act has passed, administrators at University Health Services say that the law has had a limited impact on the number of students enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan and on the details of Harvard’s student health care coverage.
“There has been minimal change in the number of students who waived the Harvard Student Health Insurance Plan for Spring 2014,” Director of HUHS Paul J. Barreira wrote in an email to The Crimson. In October, UHS advised Harvard students to carefully consider any new plans before switching coverage.
Barreira noted in his email that since UHS does not ask for the reason why a student elects to waive the Student Health Insurance Plan, it is difficult to know how the Affordable Care Act impacted that decision.
According to Barreira, approximately 60 percent of all College students waived the Student Health Insurance Plan for 2013-2014 year. In order to be granted a waiver, a student’s non-Harvard insurance must meet Massachusetts’ “comparable coverage” requirement which, he added, not all plans purchased on the exchanges established by the ACA meet.
Barreira wrote that the ACA did not cause any changes to the details of the coverage offered by Harvard’s student health care plan, or to the services offered at UHS this year. He added that UHS continues to actively monitoring any regulation changes Massachusetts might make in response to the ACA.
“[Harvard University Student Health Program] has been active in its efforts to educate students and school administrators about the potential impact of the ACA and the new opportunities it presents,” Barreira wrote, citing communication efforts about the ACA by UHS on its website, posters, letters, and emails. “While HUHS strives to keep students informed, coverage decisions must be made by each student individually.”

Nine months after she left University Hall and her tenure as dean of Harvard College, Evelynn M. Hammonds is laying the groundwork for a new research initiative and her return to the classroom.
While this time last year, Hammonds was embroiled in a controversy over secret email searches she had a hand in approving, the former administrator is now out of the limelight, enjoying a sabbatical after five years as dean.
Hammonds will return from her year-long sabbatical to her new role as director of the Program for the Study of Race and Gender in Science and Medicine within the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research on July 1, the same day incoming College Dean Rakesh Khurana moves into her old office.
Hammonds, who holds faculty appointments in the History of Science and African and African American Studies departments, wrote in an emailed statement that she has been “talking with colleagues and experts in industry, government and academia about my new program in the Hutchins Center, soliciting their advice about important areas to focus on” over the course of the past year, in addition to doing research and presenting on her work.
“[O]n one project, I'm exploring ideas about the best ways to bring attention to the issue of broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields,” she wrote. “My projects are still in the planning stages, and I will be shaping them throughout the summer and the next academic year.”
The Hutchins Center, which will house Hammonds’s initiative, opened in October 2013 shortly after the announcement that donor Glenn H. Hutchins ’77 had given the University $15 million to endow its creation.
The gift united seven existing programs and provided funding for new initiatives, including the one Hammonds will oversee. As a director of one of the Center’s initiatives, Hammonds will also sit on its steering committee, according to University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who leads the Center.
Lawrence D. Bobo, chair of the African and African American Studies Department, wrote in an email in March that the Program for the Study of Race and Gender in Science and Medicine is “an exciting and timely addition to the activities of the [Hutchins] Center,” adding that there is “no one better suited to the challenge of bringing vision, leadership, impact and purpose to this program” than Hammonds.
“She is one of Harvard's most committed, critical, and searching thinkers when it comes to unpacking the ways that race and gender are implicated in the development, conduct, use and impact of scientific knowledge,” Bobo wrote.
Gates added that “Evelynn can make a major intellectual contribution to this ongoing inquiry” and suggested that she will be able to devote more time to research now that she is no longer dean.
“I was delighted when she decided she was going to step down as dean and she wanted to pursue this research project,” Gates said. “I’m glad that she is concentrating on her intellectual and research interests again as her primary focus, along with teaching.”
In addition to her research work, Hammonds will resume teaching responsibilities next academic year. She will be teaching next spring, though she said she is not certain if she will be in the classroom in the fall. The History of Science Department’s website currently lists Hammonds as the instructor of History of Science 245: “The Changing Concept of Race in Science and Medicine in the United States: From Jefferson to Genomics,” and says the course is expected to be offered in 2014-2015.
Hammonds, who served as dean of the College from 2008-2013, stepped down after an academic year marked by controversy. As chair of the Administrative Board, Hammonds oversaw the investigation of Harvard’s largest cheating case in recent memory, in which roughly 125 undergraduates were accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on the final take-home exam in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.” About 70 students were ultimately required to temporarily withdraw from the College as a result.
Controversy resurfaced in March when news broke that administrators, including Hammonds, had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans in an effort to determine the source of the perceived leak of internal Ad Board communications related to the cheating investigation to the media. In April, Hammonds told faculty members that she had authorized a second set of searches without the necessary permission, a move that broke Faculty of Arts and Sciences email privacy policy.
Amidst the fallout of the scandal, in May, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced that Hammonds would step down from the deanship. Many have suggested that her departure came as a result of the email search controversy, although Hammonds has said that it was not a “motivating factor” in the decision to leave the post.
Donald H. Pfister has served as interim dean of the College since last July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard-owned timberland plantations in Argentina that have attracted allegations of environmental and communal degradation have been reaffirmed with Forest Stewardship Council certification, which requires that the properties adhere to a comprehensive set of international principles regarding environmental, economic, and social impact.
The independent third-party Rainforest Alliance accredited the plantations, EVASA and Las Misiones, located in northern Argentina, on behalf of FSC.
The news comes as the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, which co-authored a report criticizing the University’s timberland management practices in the region, hosts two Argentinian organizers to raise awareness of the issue on campus. On Sunday, those organizers called into question the rigor of the FSC certification and lodged additional complaints against Harvard Management Company.
“We've known that the plantations have technically been certified,” Blake A. McGhghy ’17, a student leader of Responsible Investment, said. “This is not new news. But it also does not change our campaign.”
Members of the student activist organization said that the FSC certification, which is voluntarily sought by an organization, is not sufficient in determining whether basic human rights and environmental practices are upheld. The certification audit also raised several new points of non-compliance, which must be remedied by at least the next year or HMC will lose its certification.
“The FSC standard is very low and not rigorous. It is not enough,” said Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, another Responsible Investment student leader. “We think Harvard can and should do more to guarantee environmental and social sustainability.”
The certification process is just the latest data point in a larger back-and-forth about the timberlands. In Oct. 2013 Responsible Investment published a report claiming that the eucalyptus and pine trees planted in the HMC-owned wetlands soak up a significant amount of water, depleting the supply for farmers and households and placing financial stress on locals.
Emilio Spataro, who works to defend wetlands near the HMC-owned property, and Adrian Obregon, who is a leader of the local small producers association, said Sunday that in addition, trucks servicing the plantation perpetually destroy the dirt roads surrounding their communities.
“When they transport the trees, they destroy the roads,” Obregon told The Crimson through a translator. “There’s no health or security system in our small town, so we cannot get to the hospitals or police in the big city. We need the roads to be paved.”
HMC countered this claim and others in an internal memo circulated last week based on an onsite visit in Argentina to review the management of the plantations in late March.
"Many of the allegations raised by Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition and The Oakland Institute in their report, Harvard in Ibera, and accompanying documentary are unfounded and inaccurate," the memo reads.
In response to allegations that HMC does not comply with all legally required employment practices, does not regularly assess and monitor environmental impacts, and does not limit plantation expansion to non-populated areas, the HMC memo listed counterexamples, such as its implementation of an integrated management system for employment oversight, the use of environmental impact assessments, and no intention to expand the plantations, respectively.
The memo also points to misrepresentations in the RI report of the distances between EVASA and Las Misiones and their surrounding communities, as well as misclassification of dwellings not owned by Harvard as Harvard properties.
Regarding claims that trucks destroy local dirt roads, the memo says that Las Misiones and EVASA use a road that circumvents the Chavarria area, not the dirt road running through the center of town. FSC’s audit of EVASA confirms this fact, but suggests that use of the route still creates disruptive dust clouds the company is working to address.
In Cambridge on Sunday, Spataro and Obregon said that dialogue is needed between the Argentinian locals and Harvard to address discrepancies between the two group’s experiences. Obregon said that the regular, open door public meetings promised by EVASA and Las Misiones have only occurred once.
Spataro and Obregon will speak to members of HMC to express their concerns on Tuesday, and spend the rest of the week speaking to groups in Cambridge and New York City.
“We hope Harvard listens to what we have to say,” Spataro said through a translator. “We’re not against Harvard; we don’t want Harvard to leave Corrientes.”

Undergraduate Council representatives approved changes to Operation Ghost Protocol and passed a collection of legislation allocating funds to campus-wide events in the group’s general meeting Sunday.
Specifying revisions similar to those he detailed in last week’s meeting, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 presented an amendment to the Council’s Ghost Protocol policy, which formerly required Council members to be present every Friday in their House dining hall.
UC representatives will now be required to report to their dining halls to solicit student feedback every other Friday, according to the approved amendment. Additionally, the amendment created the position of Ghost Protocol Director, an office that will be occupied by Kirkland House representative Kate A. Buellesbach ’16.
After a brief discussion about whether the top priority of Ghost Protocol should be to increase the Council’s communication with students or, instead, to analyze data and determine what students want, the Council quickly moved on to several pieces of funding legislation.
The Council unanimously approved allocating $4,680 of the Freshman Class Committee’s available funds for three future initiatives for freshmen, including $900 for a nutella-themed study break.
Afterwards, the UC voted in favor of its weekly grants pack, which will distribute about $13,500 to an array of student organizations and clubs.
Student Initiatives Committee Chair C.C. Gong ’15, an inactive Crimson editor, then presented four pieces of legislation to direct money to future events. All plans passed with unanimous consent.
As part of the grants, the committee’s Vice Chair Kevin H. Xiong ’17 announced a school wide dance that the UC and College Events board will sponsor later this semester. The $1600 the UC agreed to utilize for the event will be matched with a $1500 contribution from the CEB, Xiong said at the meeting.
The UC also endorsed a large masquerade themed party being organized by Amna H. Hashmi ’16, a Crimson News editor, and Michelle M. Lee ’15, co-Presidents of the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum. The event, to be held later this month, will raise funds to combat malaria.
In approving the legislation, the Council agreed to publicize the event and pledged the presence of at least 12 of its members at the party.
Argentine activists who live near a Harvard-owned plantation in Argentina also attended the meeting, delivering statements translated by students in the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition.

The 30th anniversary of Harvard’s CityStep inspired a flashback through time as dinosaurs, Greek heroes, and American explorers danced on stage in Sanders Theatre Friday and Saturday evening.
Since its founding in 1983 by Sabrina T. Peck ’84, CityStep—which partners Harvard undergraduates with Cambridge public school students—has grown to be one of the largest independent public service organization at Harvard.
Rachel M. Hansen ’14, one of the show’s executive directors, said the program aims to foster creativity, self-expression, and teamwork through arts education.
“CityStep brings the kids together as a class and also helps them grow and be more confident. You see them kind of break out of their shells,” Hansen said.
More than 150 Cambridge students and 65 Harvard undergraduates performed in the annual event that marks the end of a school year’s worth of practice. To commemorate CityStep’s growth over time, the show was themed as an exploration through time.
The performance began with the first-year students of the program from the Tobin Montessori School doing a prehistoric-themed dance. The next acts moved through ancient Greece, the exploration of America, the roaring ’20s, and the 1970s. Finally, it ended with a tribute to the future.
CityStep instructors also performed a dance themed after the classic 1980s film “The Breakfast Club” in honor of the organization’s founding year.
Current CityStep members reached out to CityStep alumni, the CityStep Graduate Board, and Peck to attend the show. Saturday afternoon’s performance also drew parents and teachers from the participating schools.
“The show was so great, and the kids were so excited afterwards,” said Bianca M. Nfonoyim ’15, one of the teachers for first-year students. “I just love seeing the kids on stage and how smiley they were seeing their parents and family and friends cheer for them. I felt really good about it.”
CityStep instructors taught seven classrooms of fifth, sixth, and seventh graders across the Cambridge public school district—the Amigos School, Tobin Montessori School, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School, King-Open School, Putnam Avenue Upper School, and Cambridge Street Upper School.
Each CityStep classroom has four or five Harvard undergraduate dance teachers as well as a classroom director who oversees the teachers for each class.
“I think probably the coolest thing is throughout the year seeing how the kids grow and change from CityStep. In the beginning, some of them might be a little more shy, not into dancing a lot, but it’s really great too see how throughout the year they get more confident and really into it,” Nfonoyim said.
The performance ended with a packed stage of all performers, instructors, and alumnus who joined in organization’s signature dance and bow-out, wrapping up CityStep for the school year.

Maura T. Healey ’92 joined friends, classmates, and former Olympians at John Harvard's Brewery & Ale House on Saturday to raise money and drum up support for her campaign for Massachusetts attorney general.
The afternoon event served as a gathering for her supporters, as well as a pre-game party for the NCAA men's basketball game later that evening.
“Basketball was a huge part of my life here” said Healey, who served as the captain of the female varsity basketball team during her time at Harvard. “When I was at Harvard I learned things on the court, off the court, in the classroom, from the friendships I made, that stayed with me my entire life. And it’s those lessons, I see play out everyday in my life—particularly in this campaign.”
Healey, who subsequently played professional basketball in Europe after graduation, said the sport taught her to juggle various tasks, a skill that has helped her launch her nascent political career.
“It was very demanding balancing Division I athletics with a Harvard education,” Healey said. “It definitely left me with an ability to manage any number of things at once, it made me disciplined, if taught me about work ethic, and that sometimes, when you work hard and you work together, you can do a lot of things.”
Healey’s campaign manager Michael B. Firestone ’05 added that the enthusiasm generated by her basketball experience was a great way to give Healey “a chance to reconnect with her teammates, and her classmates, and many supporters, and the Harvard community.”
On Saturday, Healey gave a short speech thanking everyone for coming and shared a synopsis of the major issues she would hope to tackle if elected attorney general, including gun violence, women’s contraceptive rights, predatory loans, and accessibility to behavioral and mental services.
“Her credentials are unparalleled for the job” said Caitlin K. Cahow ’07-’08, a former Harvard Ice Hockey captain and medalist in the 2006 Winter Olympics. “As a former Harvard female athlete, I think it’s important to step up and support former female athletes who have blazed the trail for us, and Maura is definitely someone who’s done this.”
Katey Stone, the Harvard women’s ice hockey head coach and coach of the 2014 US women’s hockey team, also attended the event.
“I wanted to come tonight and learn as much as I could,” Stone said. “I’m eager to continue to learn more and potentially get involved in the campaign.”
Nicole P. Haughey ’93 said she thinks Healey would excel if elected Attorney General.
“I think that Maura is a terrific person and she would be terrific for the state of Massachusetts,” Haughey said. “All of her past experiences in life have really positioned her to excel in this role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 8, 2014, at 12:38 p.m.
Starting on April 21, undergraduates will be able to vote on the only question on the Undergraduate Council’s spring referendum generated by a student petition—whether or not to support the reintroduction of American Sign Language courses that may be taken for credit.
A petition led by Erica X Eisen ’16, a Crimson Arts Chair, and Julia B. Hyman ’15 garnered 704 votes, surpassing the 670 signature threshold required for a question to be placed on the ballot, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Kevin H. Xiong ’17.
In their 300-word pro statement, Eisen and Hyman emphasized the importance of ASL, but noted obstacles students currently face in learning the language.
“ASL is a beautiful, unique language with a culture and literature all its own—but Harvard students currently taking ASL must pay out of pocket to take weekend classes organized by PBHA's Committee on Deaf Awareness (CODA). Students receive no academic credit for enrollment in these classes,” they wrote.
Despite high student demand, the Linguistics Department eliminated its two introductory sign language courses in 1994, citing budget constraints.
Julian Guy ’16, a former University Initiatives Coordinator for the CODA said that reintroducing the course at the College would attract more students and allow them to study the language more closely.
“Having a rigorous course would be the best way to ensure that people are actually going to be able to learn the language...at a full level,” Guy said.
Hyman, who serves as director of the CODA, noted that even though many students may want to take ASL courses, it is difficult for them to do so.
“It's very hard for students to be able to get to a Sunday class and one that is for no course credit is hard for Harvard students to be able to fit in their schedule, even if it’s  something that is important,” Hyman said, adding that the CODA has been working for several years to reintegrate ASL classes into the course catalog.
Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, UC Education Committee chair, said that although the committee has not been in contact with the petition organizers, he agrees that the effort would be an  “absolutely fantastic” means of equipping students with sign language communication skills.
Because of changes made last year in the UC’s referenda procedure, in order for the Council to immediately adopt the voter’s response to the question as its official stance, at least half the student body must participate in the election.
Before the question goes on the ballot, the UC will solicit a 300-word con statement from students and collaborate with the Institute of Politics to edit the question and statements to ensure neutral wording.
Although the deadline for petitions has passed, individual UC representatives may submit additional referenda questions to the Council.

Bostonians remained safe and resolute following the 2013 marathon bombings because of years of preparation, according to a new report by four emergency management and criminal justice professors and other faculty members at the Kennedy School, Law School, and Business School.
“Boston Strong was not a chance result,” the report, released April 3, said. “It was, instead, the product of years of investment of time and hard work by people across multiple jurisdictions, levels of government, agencies, and organizations to allow command-level coordination and effective cooperation among agencies.”
According to a press release from the Kennedy School, the analysis serves to identify “those critical moments when planning, preparation and coordination paid off—as well as those occasions when performance left room for improvement.”
The report asserts that the initial response from medical and law officials was effective and helped limit the number of fatalities. When two pressure-cooker bombs exploded 12 seconds apart near the marathon finish line on Boylston Street on April 15, three people were killed on scene, but all of the estimated 264 others who were injured were kept alive and treated immediately.
But, according to the study, the coordination between law officials during the ensuing manhunt that caused a day-long “shelter-in-place” advisory also showed some significant flaws.
“The stresses of these events in Boston showed some fault lines in the doctrine—and in the depth of implementation of the doctrine—and these provide an opportunity for further progress both in Boston and elsewhere before the next events begin to unfold,” the report said.
The group of authors consists of Business School professor Herman B. “Dutch” Leonard ’74, Executive Director of Kennedy School’s Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management Christine M. Cole, Executive Director of Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation Arnold M. Howitt ’71, and Law School professor Philip B. Heymann. The report said that the authors spent the last several months examining the “100 hours of intense drama that riveted the attention of the nation and left the local public shaken and yet proud.”
The authors’ series of interviews and investigations culminated in a day-long expert dialogue at the Kennedy School in March that brought together around 100 law enforcement officials, witnesses, and experts to compare experiences and opinions.
Howitt told The Crimson that as part of his plans to distribute the report’s findings to a wide audience, he hopes to talk to media outlets, speak to police groups, and testify before the House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security.
“We can’t guarantee everything we say is going to get into professional practice, but we certainly had useful dialogue,” Howitt said. “Many people seemed to find the findings useful.”

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha J. Power will address 2014 graduates of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at the school’s Class Day on May 28, Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 announced in a press release Monday.
Power graduated from Harvard Law School in 1999 and served as a professor and founding executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School before becoming special assistant to the President and the senior director for multilateral affairs on the National Security Council in 2008.
As the U.S. Ambassador to the UN—a position she assumed in August 2013—Power “works to advance U.S. interests, promote and defend universal values, and address pressing global challenges to international peace, security, and prosperity,” according to the press release.
Power is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning author for her 2002 book, "’A Problem from Hell’: America and the Age of Genocide.” She is married to University professor Cass R. Sunstein, ’75, whom she met working on Obama’s first presidential campaign.
Ellwood expressed excitement at bringing Power back to the Kennedy School to share her political experiences with new graduates.
“We are thrilled and honored to have Ambassador Samantha Power as our Commencement speaker. We will be proud to welcome back a figure of such great international renown and demonstrated leadership to inspire and guide our graduates,” Ellwood wrote in an email to The Crimson.
“Throughout her strong sense of moral vision and deep humanity have made her a compelling leader at HKS and across the globe,” he added.
Power’s Kennedy School address will not be her first on a Harvard Class Day; she also gave the Law School’s Class Day address in 2010.
Power joins a growing list of Class Day speakers already announced for 2014, including U.S. Surgeon General nominee Vivek H. Murthy ’98, who will speak at the Medical School, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara ’90 and actress Mindy Kaling, who will speak at the Law School, and Salman Khan, founder of the free online education platform Khan Academy, who will speak at the Business School. The College has yet to announce its Class Day speakers.

UPDATED: April 8, 2014, at 12:57 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust announced several new initiatives to mobilize solutions to climate change in an email to the Harvard community Monday afternoon, including the decision to adhere to investment policies and practices laid out by the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment.
According to the email, titled “Confronting climate change,” the three-fold endeavor will launch a research-focused Climate Change Solutions Fund, increase sustainability measures on campus, and affirm the endowment’s commitment to environmentally sustainable and socially conscious investing.
Faust began the letter by echoing previous statements she has made regarding the urgency of climate change and wrote that she believes Harvard and other universities have a unique role in protecting the planet.
“As a university, [Harvard] has a special obligation and accountability to the future, to the long view needed to anticipate and alter the trajectory and impact of climate change,” she wrote in the email. “Harvard also possesses the wide range of capacities across fields and disciplines that must be mobilized and conjoined in order to create effective solutions.”
The first area of the initiative, research, will be jumpstarted at the beginning of the next academic year with $1 million in grants awarded through a newly-created Climate Change Solutions Fund. Faust wrote that she will look to donors to help expand the fund to $20 million to “catalyze the aspects of [current] research that specifically focus on shaping and accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy system.”
She also wrote that the Harvard Campaign has already raised $120 million to support research related to energy and the environment.
The initiative’s second area focuses on current sustainability efforts on campus. As Faust mentioned in the letter, the University set a goal in 2008 of a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2006 baseline. The current reduction has been 21 percent, including effects of growth and renovation
Faust wrote in the letter that the University will “explore and exhaust” options to increase efficiency on campus. She also wrote that she will also create a senior faculty-led committee focused on sustainability.
Lastly, Faust addressed Harvard’s endowment, which has recently generated criticism related to its management and environmental impact, and particularly its investment in the fossil fuel industry. In the letter, Faust acknowledged and reaffirmed her controversial announcement last October that the University would not divest from the fossil fuel industry.
However, she announced that the endowment will become a signatory to both the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment and the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate change program. The former organization provides a framework for combining prudent investment with consideration for environmental, social, and governance factors, while the latter advocates, with investors, for transparency in the environmental impact of portfolio companies.
Harvard’s is the first university to agree to follow the PRI principals in the United States.
“Both these significant steps underscore our growing efforts to consider environmental, social and governance issues among the many factors that inform our investment decision-making, with a paramount concern for how the endowment can best support the academic aspirations and educational opportunities that define our distinctive purposes as a university,” Faust wrote.
 
Members of Divest Harvard, a student organization that calls for Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuel companies, said Monday evening that they were “encouraged” by Faust’s initiatives but still consider there to be a “long way to go.”
 
Henney H. Sullivan ’15, a member of Divest Harvard, said that he was “troubled” that Faust’s announcement did not address the “political obstruction that stops Harvard research from being implemented.” He added that there were discrepancies in Harvard’s approach to finding solutions for climate change.
 
Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, an activist on-campus organization that advocates for just endowment management practices, similarly praised the decision and “the new direction” laid out by Faust in a statement, while urging vigilance.
 
“We hope that Harvard’s new commitments to responsible investment will lead to a swift resolution to the conflict between Harvard's plantations in Argentina and the surrounding communities,” the group wrote in a statement.

Harvard community members and guests from the greater Cambridge area packed into Sanders Theatre Monday afternoon to listen to four female leaders from various fields, as they shared their experiences working in positions of authority and reflected on the changing role of women in the workplace.
The panel was comprised of Executive Editor of The New York Times Jill Abramson '76, Global Head of Human Capital Management at Goldman Sachs Edith W. Cooper '83, and President of the University of California system Janet Napolitano. Former Obama administration cabinet member Karen G. Mills '75 moderated the public discussion, which was hosted by University President Drew G. Faust. 
“What does power require of women—beyond a thick skin, that is? What does it take to get there?” Faust asked in her opening speech for the event. “What does it take to stay there?”
At the beginning of the discussion, each panelist shared the story of her rise through the professional ranks. 
Abramson, who was a member of the first Harvard class in which females were permitted to live in the Yard, spoke about her journey from a being self-described “goofball” to holding the highest-ranked position in The New York Times newsroom. Although she credited a “fortunate coincidence” for her first reporting experience, she also said that women in positions of power must trust themselves.
“To become a leader, you have to be your authentic self,” she said. “We spend an awful lot of effort to sandpaper off supposed rough edges, and maybe I do [have them], but at the end of the day, to lead, you need to make some difficult gut calls—to believe in yourself.”
Cooper agreed with Abramson, and added that besides being authentic, it is also important to know one’s audience and to adapt in order to achieve one’s goals. 
All the panelists credited “networks of women” in their respective workplaces not only for advancing gender equity by providing safe spaces and mentorship, but also for strengthening their organizations.
“Difference is not only an edge for an individual once they realize it, but it’s also [an edge] in terms of the outcome,” Cooper said. 
Attendee Emily L. Chen '15 said that she was struck by the similarities between the remarks of the panelists, despite the different industries they worked in. 
“I think they had very similar overarching themes,” Chen said. “I think it’s very interesting how they all tied together.”
Throughout the discussion, the panelists referenced the experiences and achievements of other notable female figures, from Anita Hill to Hillary Clinton, to the two female journalists recently shot in Afghanistan. Abramson said she consciously chose to place these journalists’ photos “above the fold” of The New York Times’ Saturday paper to highlight their contributions to journalism.
During the question-and-answer portion of the event, audience members who posed questions to the panelists also talked about their own experiences as women in leadership. 
“Times have changed. They may not be perfect, but I think my message to all of you today is that we belong,” Mills said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This is the third article in an occasional semester-long series on homelessness in Harvard Square. Read the first and second installments here and here.
 
At the heart of Harvard Square, between restaurants Au Bon Pain and Yenching, Lauren Canon holds a sign asking for food. On the ground beside her, Canon’s boyfriend Justin Newton has a sign that reads “too broke to pay attention.”
As they wait, a woman coming out of Yenching hands them a bag of Chinese food. They pull out a camping utensil and begin eating.
“We’ll take whatever you want to get us,” Newton said. “You want to buy us Chinese food, we’ll take it. You want to buy us subs, we’ll take that. When we’re hungry, we’re not picky, we’ll take whatever you want to give us.”
For Canon and Newton, one of the benefits of living in Harvard Square is the abundance of restaurants. Canon said that the relationships between the businesses and the resident homeless are generally more cordial than what she experienced in Detroit or Burlington, Vermont.
John P. DiGiovanni, president of the Harvard Square Business Association, characterized the relationship as “quite good.”
Most Harvard Square business owners, DiGiovanni said, accept homelessness as a part of the Square’s culture.
“We are not Disney World, where you have anything just perfect and neat and really not authentic,” said DiGiovanni, who owns several Square properties including the Garage.
According to HSBA executive director Denise A. Jillson, some Square business owners address the issue of homelessness through donations that are directed to the root causes behind homelessness.
The HSBA, which includes more than 440 members, has fundraised for Youth on Fire, a daytime drop-in center for homeless youth, and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. Some businesses also make individual food or financial donations.
Within this cordial relationship, however, store owners identified tensions, saying that the visible homeless population can detract from business and the shopping experience.
Anthony Allen, co-founder of Otto Pizza, said that the homeless who congregate outside his storefront have occasionally intimidated his customers and employees.
When asked if the homeless might have deterred customers from coming in, Allen said, “We have families coming up, and they’re often, you know, it’s just a lot of bad language, drinking, and smoking.”
Allen said that a few aggressive panhandlers have threatened his employees. In one incident, which he reported to Cambridge police, a panhandler demanded money from a worker and claimed that he had a knife.
Due to the incident, the store now has an overhead light in the back, a buzzer system that locks the back door, and more regular police patrols, Allen said.
Nonetheless, Allen identified the cases as rare and said that he has only called the police on a few occasions since Otto’s opening in 2011.
For business owners and the homeless, there is an unspoken agreement regarding panhandling at storefronts. Paul J. MacDonald, owner of Leavitt and Peirce, said that panhandlers usually sit between stores so that they do not block the display windows.
On a Sunday afternoon, Harley, a 19-year-old, self-described “gypsy,” was panhandling outside CVS Pharmacy on Mass Ave.
“I haven’t really moved since about 10 a.m. and they haven’t come outside to yell at me,” she said.
Harley said that CVS and other Square establishments were generally “okay” and said that she has only seen panhandlers be scolded by business owners for “something really wrong...like stealing.”
Davie, who prefers to be identified by his last name, usually spends the whole day outside of Harvard Book Store. In an interview in February with The Crimson, he said that he has a good relationship with the store owner and the staff.
“I keep the place tidy when I leave,” he said. “It wouldn’t look like I was here at all.”

Nearly two months after he left his position as a lecturer in the Department of History and Literature to become the speechwriter for newly elected Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh, Eoin F. Cannon ’95 said that he misses his time at Harvard but plans to stay at his post for the duration of Walsh’s term. 
The transition from academia to government was not abrupt for Cannon, who began volunteering for the Walsh campaign in May 2013 after publishing a book entitled “The Saloon and The Mission.”
“I hadn’t started my next project yet, and was trying to figure out what my next step would be around the time that the mayoral season started up,” Cannon said.
Cannon, who has been a Dorchester resident for 17 years, said he already had a particular affinity for Walsh even before he became mayor.
“Mayor Walsh had been my state representative since he ran for office in 1997, and I had always been a huge admirer for his politics [and] as a person,” Cannon said. “I had always been a political junkie and a great lover of the city of Boston, so I got involved with the campaign as a volunteer, helping with whatever writing projects he needed.”
As the mayoral season heated up, Cannon found that his “scholarship side had been displaced by this interest in politics and elections.” When Walsh was elected to the mayor’s office, Cannon helped write his inaugural speech. It was also around this time that Cannon informed Harvard’s History and Literature department that he was going to seek a more permanent position on Mayor Walsh’s team. By mid-February, Cannon was hired as Walsh’s speechwriter.
“We already knew his product of work from his volunteering on the campaign, and we could see him fitting in with the team.  We asked him to write us a few speeches on a variety of different topics and he really knocked those out of the park,” Daniel A. Koh ’07, Walsh’s chief of staff, said.
Reflecting on his time as a part of the History and Literature department, Cannon said he is “hard-pressed” to decide whether he misses his colleagues or students more.
“[The Hist and Lit department] is an intensely satisfying place to work and teach. I’ve learned more from students in Hist and Lit than sometimes from anyone else in recent years,” he said.
Cannon’s former students said they remember him as a thoughtful teacher and adviser, and applaud his efforts in his new appointment.
“I’m sure he’s great in the mayor’s office.  I think that as a scholar of American History and Literature he has a developed sense of the traditional political rhetoric of Boston, and how things need to be said in order for the mayor to be effective,” said Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, who took Cannon’s History and Literature tutorial.
Although Cannon calls himself a “scholar and teacher at heart,” he said he does not see himself leaving his position before the end of Walsh’s term.
“I’d love to go back to the classroom someday, informed by what I’ve been doing in government,” Cannon said.

Economics professor Jeremy C. Stein will resign from his position on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in May and return to Harvard, according to a letter Stein submitted to President Barack Obama last week.
Stein was originally appointed to serve on the Board through 2018, and news outlets have speculated that Stein decided to return to Harvard to maintain his tenured professorship. According to the Faculty Handbook, professors must resign their tenured appointments after two years of not teaching at Harvard.
Stein assumed his post at the Federal Reserve in 2012 and has since worked on crafting monetary policy and assessing its impact on economic stability.
“During my time here, the economy has moved steadily back in the direction of full employment, and a number of important steps have been taken to make the financial system stronger and more resilient,” Stein wrote in the letter to Obama.
With Stein’s return to Harvard just weeks away, professors in the Economics department said they are eager to welcome Stein back to Cambridge.
“[Stein] is a fantastic lecturer and wonderful economist,” said N. Gregory Mankiw, chair of the Economics department. “The Federal Reserve’s loss is our gain.”
Economics professor Andrei Shleifer ’82 said that Stein distinguished himself at the Federal Reserve by taking controversial positions and thinking critically about crucial issues.
“He brought extremely important issues into play during his time in the Federal Reserve,” Shleifer said. “He now has an even greater understanding of inflation and price stability from different points in the government.”
Another colleague, professor John Y. Campbell, agreed that Stein has gained valuable experience while working at the Federal Reserve and predicted that the experience would serve Stein well when he returns to teach at Harvard.
“[Stein] has a keen sense of what type of research will be helpful to policymakers and will be well-equipped to teach fascinating courses for undergraduates,” Campbell said. “He’s been thinking very hard about the nature of the modern banking system and how government policy can contribute to its stability.”
Campbell said thinks Stein may focus his research on banks and their investments once he returns to Harvard. Stein delivered a speech in January at the annual American Economic Association’s meeting in Philadelphia about the connection between the ways in which banks fund themselves and the types of investments they make.
Campbell added that he has missed Stein over the past two years.
“He’s a superb colleague,” Campbell said. “He’s very collaborative and involved in a broad range of fields. Jeremy’s a key member of the finance group within the department.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At halftime Saturday in Ithaca, N.Y., the Harvard men’s lacrosse team exhaled a collective sigh of relief. For the Crimson (5-4, 3-0 Ivy), breaking even after 30 minutes of play against the undefeated second-ranked team in the country, Cornell (9-1, 3-1), was in itself an impressive achievement. The Crimson had struggled against top opponents so far this season, dropping games to North Carolina, Duke, and Albany by a combined 15 goals.
But this time was different.
“I told the team to just take a deep breath,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Coming out of the half, our players not only believed, but they really knew that if we went out and executed, then we could outplay them for thirty minutes.”
Over the course of the third quarter, the Crimson outscored the Big Red, 6-1. Harvard then maintained that lead through the closing whistle, eventually winning, 14-9, to solidify its spot alone atop the Ivy League standings.
“We have a long way to go,” Wojcik said. “But this game helped to put us in a good position going towards the postseason.”
The Crimson struggled in many aspects of the game. The team had a lower save percentage, more turnovers, and a far worse man-up conversion percentage than its opponent.
Behind the game-changing individual performance of Gabriel Mendola, however, Harvard dominated the possession. The senior midfielder secured 20 of 27 faceoffs, ensuring that Harvard could take more shots and control possession throughout the contest.
“Mendola was the most valuable player for us,” Wojcik said. “It’s a team effort, but he was the biggest difference maker in the game.”
Yet even with Mendola’s performance, the match was hardly a lock, as the Crimson did not take a lead until the second half.
The Big Red scored first with a goal from senior midfielder Joe Paoletta two and a half minutes into the game, but Harvard answered quickly as sophomore attackman Ian Ardrey nailed a shot past Cornell freshman goaltender Christian Knight to tie the game.
Over the next five minutes, the Crimson faced its most challenging test of the game. Senior midfielders Mike O’Neil and Connor Entemann, along with Paoletta scored three straight for the Big Red to take a 4-1 lead with six minutes left in the quarter.
“We knew we were in a tough spot,” sophomore attackman Will Walker said. “Against a team like that, if you go down, you really need to work to stop the bleeding quickly.”
Instead of throwing in the towel, Harvard fought back.  First, sophomore attackman Deke Burns scored off an assist from classmate and fellow attackman Devin Dwyer. Burns then set up co-captain midfielder Peter Schwartz to reduce the home team’s lead to one going into the second quarter.
Soon after the restart, the Crimson drew a Cornell penalty and drew even with a strike from Burns on another Dwyer assist. The Big Red answered almost immediately, with two rapid goals from senior attackman Dan Lintner and junior midfielder John Hogan, but that would be the last time that Cornell would extend a lead.
Schwartz scored again with 7:25, and then Walker, Harvard’s leading scorer, got on the board with 53 seconds left to tie the game going into the half.
“Our offense has been really firing recently,” Walker said. “We got great ball movement, and it really put us in some great spots.”
Coming out of the break, the Crimson caught fire. Burns scored first off an assist from Walker, giving Harvard its first lead of the game. Two minutes later, senior attackman Carl Zimmerman notched a goal. Hogan answered for Cornell, decreasing the lead down to one, but from there, the Crimson dominated, thanks in large part to Mendola’s repeated faceoff wins.
Senior midfielder Daniel Eipp nailed the net first, off an assist from Zimmerman, followed two minutes later by Walker assisted by Dwyer.
Zimmerman then added another goal thirty seconds later, assisted by Schwartz, and then with only seven seconds left in the quarter, Walker scored again, this time assisted by senior midfielder Pat Fiorvanti. Harvard led the second best team in the nation 12-7, going into the final period.
“We got together in the huddle, and we all knew what we needed to do,” Walker said of the team’s feelings after final break. “The next fifteen minutes were going to be everything we had. We had nothing to lose and we knew that we could do it.”
Only 20 seconds into the fourth period, Walker scored his fourth goal of the game, and 26th of the season, assisted by Burns. Hogan and John Edmonds scored for Cornell, but the Big Red would not score again. Dwyer put one more past Knight to extend the lead to its final score, 14-9, and ensure the Crimson’s command of the Ivy League.
“The difference in the game was our players,” Wojcik said. “We came in really hungry, and we really wanted this game. We were scrappy and the hustle was always there. That really allowed us to control the tone of the game and come out on top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team came out firing against Brown on Saturday, racing to a 5-0 lead in the early going and never looking back.
With its fastest start of the season, the Crimson (6-4, 3-1 Ivy) defeated the Bears (8-3, 2-2), 10-4, in a key Ivy League matchup at Harvard Stadium.
Sophomore midfielder Audrey Todd got the scoring going early, tallying the first two goals of the game just four minutes into the contest. She then notched her third score of the game and the fourth for Harvard 10 minutes later as she led the early scoring barrage for the hosts.
Despite the offensive fireworks to open the game for the Crimson, the star of the game may well have been the Harvard team defense.
“It was a good, solid team effort,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “It starts with your mark-ups…. [We] helped and rotated pretty well. We scouted them, but the bottom line is the kids have to go in and make the plays, and they did.”
With three games left in the conference season, the Crimson sits just above the Bears in a two-way tie for second place with Princeton in the Ancient Eight standings.
Brown entered the contest averaging more than 13 goals per game on the season, but the Harvard defense remained stout, doubling quickly and holding the Bears to one first half goal as the Crimson entered halftime with a 6-1 advantage.
Although there were moments throughout when Brown appeared to climb back, Harvard routinely answered and maintained control of the game.
The Bears came to life late in the first half, breaking through for their first goal and creating multiple scoring chances. Co-captain midfielder Kyleigh Keating scored with 13 seconds left in the opening frame to put the Crimson right back in the driver’s seat.
“We always talk about momentum, so once the momentum was going their way, we knew that we had to come together and get the next draw, or get a turnover on the defensive end…[to] really stop their momentum,” co-captain attacker Chelsey Newman said.
From the opening whistle in the second half, Brown appeared rejuvenated by the halftime break. Senior attacker Danielle Mastro put the Bears on the board first in the final period, scoring 30 seconds in.
After senior attacker Grace Healy scored to pull the Bears within three goals, it appeared the Harvard lead might be slipping away, but the Crimson bounced back again as freshman midfielder Megan Hennessey answered less than a minute later.
“We’re getting better, it’s just responding to runs. It’s a game of momentum, and I thought [in previous games] we let some teams get away from us,” Miller said. “Now they’re getting better at managing that and managing how they feel about it, so I think that’s just [a result of] a little bit more game experience.”
One of the most important assets of this Harvard team has been its youth. The Crimson’s  five leading goal scorers are all underclassmen. Freshman Marisa Romeo capped off Harvard’s opening 5-0 run with her team-leading 33rd goal of the season.
As it has throughout the season, Harvard utilized a balance attack that saw seven different players record goals. Five players tallied once each, and Newman added the last two scores of the game to seal the win for Harvard.
“It’s a pretty balanced unit, we run a motion offense that just lets everybody be a threat, and we expect everybody to be a threat,” Miller said.
On Saturday, the biggest threat for the Crimson was Todd, who completed a hat trick for the second game in a row. She has six goals in Harvard’s last two games despite averaging just a goal a game in the team’s first eight this season.
The win kept the Crimson in a tie with Princeton for second place in the Ivy League, and continued Harvard’s dominance over unranked teams this season. The Crimson has won all six of its games against unranked opponents, but Harvard yet to beat a ranked team, going 0-4 in such matchups so far this season.
“Now we’re definitely in a transition period in our season, but we are young, so it was hard to get our confidence early on when we had some of those games,” Newman said. “But we play a tough schedule for a reason, and I think even though we lost those it helped us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early in the Harvard women’s tennis team’s meeting with Cornell on Saturday afternoon, the two doubles matches on courts three and four seemed strikingly similar.
On court four, the Big Red sophomore duo of Dena Tanenbaum and Christy Kung were rallying back against Crimson sophomores Amanda Lin and Amy He, while on court three it was Harvard’s freshman pair of Spencer Liang and June Lee making a comeback against Cornell freshmen Monica Cusick and Alexandra D’Ascenzo.
For Harvard’s Lin and He, the challenge their teammates were putting up next door was all the motivation they needed to end the Big Red’s rally. After falling behind, 15-0, in a decisive 7-6 game, the Crimson strung together four consecutive points to take the match, 8-6.
“What really helped is that our first doubles match was still out there and fighting,” Lin said. “Looking over and seeing them being down and working their way back really motivated us to try to close out the match for them.”
In Harvard’s opening weekend of Ivy League play at the Murr Center, the doubles matches on Saturday energized the Crimson (9-5, 1-1 Ivy) to rebound after Friday’s 6-1 loss to Columbia (14-2, 3-0). The team did just that, and took down Cornell (7-6, 0-3), 6-1.
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 1
Captain Hannah Morrill and freshman Monica Lin set the tone for the day. A series of powerful overheads and down-the-line winners off the racket of Morrill extended their lead to 7-0 against Big Red senior Shannon Comolli and junior Lauren Frazier. Cornell challenged the Crimson with a series of long points in the final game, but it was not enough. A lob to the back-end of the court followed by a powerful down-the-line shot helped Morrill and Lin close out the match, 8-1.
“Morrill and M. Lin really stepped up big time for us and got us on the board,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “Their energy was amazing. They had a really positive attitude and they executed.”
Morrill continued to set the pace in her singles match, handily defeating Comolli, 6-1, 6-4. Liang and A. Lin also notched comfortable singles victories, while He and junior Sylvia Li each bested her opponent in decisive tie-breakers to propel the Crimson to a 6-1 team victory.
“We took the loss against Columbia and used it to motivate us because we didn’t want the same result,” Lin said. “We tried to take it a little lighter, play a lot freer, and be really loud and supportive of our teammates, and I think it helped us execute our shots and close out matches.”
COLUMBIA 6, HARVARD 1
Nerves hindered the Crimson in its opening conference contest against No. 36 Columbia on Friday afternoon.
“Columbia is one of our biggest rivals, so this is the match that we had been working towards the whole year,” Lin said. “We went in really nervous, and we weren’t making all of our shots, so obviously the match didn’t turn out the way we wanted.”
The No.1 and 2 spots for both doubles and singles came up short for Harvard. Liang and Lee fell, 8-4. The freshmen were challenged by the powerful and consistent hitting of their opponents across the net, senior Bianca Sanon and sophomore Kanika Vaidya, who are ranked 14th among doubles teams in the nation. Morill and M. Lin lost by the same margin to the No. 30 Lions’ pair of junior Crystal Leung and freshman Tina Jiang.
Things did not improve for Harvard in singles play. Liang, M. Lin, and Lee all suffered quick defeats.
Morrill hung with senior Iona Alecsiu in the first set of her singles match, but ultimately fell short, 5-7. Alecsiu commanded the second set, 6-2, to secure the victory for the Lions.
The only bright spot of the match for Harvard was a three-set singles victory for A. Lin against Columbia senior Tiana Takenaga. After falling in the first set, Lin battled from behind to outlast Takenaga and earn the Crimson’s only victory of the afternoon.
Although the loss was a disappointing start to Ivy play for Harvard, especially since it came just after the Crimson knocked off a ranked opponent in No. 24 Houston, it is also a learning experience for the young squad.
“I am really hopeful that we can take the loss against Columbia and really look at the things that we could have done better,” Green said. “We really just want to be going one match at a time. We can’t prepare the same way every time, so it’s just trying to do the best we can in every single match.”

The Harvard men’s golf team kicked off the spring season Saturday, finishing third at the Met Invitational in New York.
Hosted by Yale, the tournament featured 18 holes at the Century Country Club in the morning and 18 more at the Old Oaks Country Club in the afternoon. The Crimson shot a 23-over 307 and a 31-over 311 on the day, finishing five strokes behind the second-place Bulldogs.
“It was our first tournament of the spring, so there’s always some tournament rust when you come off the winter,” captain Theo Lederhausen said. “We definitely think we could have played a little better, but we were definitely moving in the right direction.”
In the eight-team and forty-player field, all five Harvard golfers managed to crack the top 20. Lederhausen led the way, finishing tied for tenth place after shooting a five-over 76 at Century and an eight-over 78 at Old Oaks.
Sophomore Rohan Ramnath and freshman Robert Deng also had strong performances, each tying for 12th place with 14-over 155s. Additionally, freshmen Kendrick Vinar and Daniel De La Garza posted scores of 157 and 160, respectively.
The high stroke totals up and down the leaderboard were largely a product of the weather, as well as tough course conditions. The golfers had to battle a strong wind all day, and following a rainy week in New York, both courses were very wet.
“When a course is wet, it makes it a lot longer,” Lederhausen said. “These were already pretty difficult courses that we’ve played, but with them being even longer…it was [even harder].”
While the majority of the field was clearly impacted by the difficult conditions, one held its ground, cruising to first place seemingly unfazed.
Georgia, ranked No. 5 in the nation, shot a 16-over 580 as a team, finishing 33 strokes ahead of its closest competitor, Yale. Sophomore Lee McCoy posted the best score of the day on both courses, shooting a seven-under 64 in the morning and a one-over 71 in the afternoon.
“It’s always good to see a team like that because it kind of sets the bar pretty high,” Lederhausen said.
The rest of the field was made up of more familiar foes for the Crimson, as the entire Ivy League was represented at the competition, with the exceptions of Penn and Columbia. Besides Yale, the Crimson distanced itself from the rest of the Ancient Eight pack, finishing 15 strokes ahead of fourth-place Princeton.
“As far as how we shot and how we stood up relative to the rest of the field, I’m quite pleased with what we did,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We’re in a good place. It’s a good start to the season, and now we got to just keep on extending [our] work and extending our momentum into the next couple weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a dominant fall season, the Harvard women’s golf team returned to action this weekend, earning an eighth-place finish at the Ole Miss Rebel Intercollegiate in Oxford, Miss.
Competing against 17 other squads, several of which are among the top 40 teams in the nation, the Crimson was always in contention, finishing with a 21-over 885.
Leading the way for Harvard with one of her best outings of the season was sophomore Courtney Hooton. She finished tied for ninth, with a two-over 218 after shooting even par in the second round and posting two 73s on the par-72 Ole Miss Golf Course.
“She was a machine,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It’s not surprising to me that she did [so well]…but it’s a little surprising for most people given the amount of reps that we’ve had [for her] to be able to actually do that well. So I’m proud of Courtney.”
Besides Hooton, sophomore Christine Lin and freshman Anne Cheng also broke the top 40. After opening with a six-over 78 in the first round, Lin bounced back with a one-over 73 and an even-par 72 to tie for 32nd. Likewise, Cheng posted a six-over 78 in the second round but recovered with a one-over 73 and a two-over 74 to tie for 39th.
After Friday’s opening round, the Crimson found itself near the top of the pack. The team sat in fifth place with a score of 294, just five strokes off the lead and two behind second.
“All of the other teams, this was their third or fourth tournament of the spring season,” Rhoads said. “They’re coming in having played a bunch and as sharp as they can be, and we’re coming in really not sharp at all. So to be there [in that position] in the first round was really, really fun.”
Due to threat of rain, Sunday’s final round was moved up to Saturday, forcing the teams to play the final 36 holes of the tournament in one day. Harvard opened the day with a nine-over 297, maintaining its position in the fifth slot.
After the second leg of Saturday’s lengthy contest, however, the Crimson slipped three spots to eighth. Rhoads acknowledged that fatigue definitely played a factor in the match, but the Crimson actually fared better in the third round, matching its first-round score of 294.
“Everyone was holding their mental and emotional states together really well, but sometimes you just can’t bring back the physical and the technical [aspects of your game] if you’re a little extra fatigued,” Rhoads said. “But as the [third] round progressed, we actually were getting back on track really well, [and] we finished strong.
Taking first place in the tournament was Georgia Regents University, whicj shot a seven-over 871 as a team over the weekend. Jessica Haigwood carried the Jaguars, finishing under par in all three days and taking the individual title with a six-under 210.
Harvard finished fourteen strokes behind the Jaguars, but given that the Crimson has not been able to practice outside nearly as much as many other schools, Hooton was pleased with her team’s showing.
“In the weeks following our spring break trip, we couldn’t practice outside because it was still really cold, which is a disadvantage [against] other teams that can practice year-round,” Hooton said. “But we didn’t really let that affect us, and I think we put up a really strong performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a competitive day for the Ivy League on Saturday, when the men’s lightweight and heavyweight crew teams from Cornell, Harvard and Penn all met in Ithaca, NY for the Matthews & Leonard Cups. The Crimson sent three varsity eights and two freshmen boats and finished each division in first or second place.
“I was really pleased with this weekend overall for the team,” captain Zander Bonorris said. “I think that as far as the second weekend of racing goes, this was another really solid step in the right direction.”
Bonorris raced the first varsity eight, but sophomore teammate Cameron Clemence, on second varsity, echoed this sentiment.
“I felt that the team performed well today,” he said. “All of the races were very close, with all the boats finishing less than a length apart.”
Harvard finished on top in the second varsity eight as well as both freshmen boats. The standout performance was the second varsity, which beat Cornell by over three seconds with a time of 6 minutes, 3.7 seconds.
“They pushed away from Cornell 800m into the race to give themselves a lead that Cornell was unable to come back from,” Clemence said.
This was also the first win for the second freshmen boat, which finished at a time of 6:40.2.
“I would say the strength of the Crimson on the water was in the attention to detail,” Bonorris said. “All the crews in the league are fit and strong and so the crews that find extra speed in their technical precision are the ones that ultimately stand out.”
The first varsity boat fell to second place with a time of 5:54.2, over a full second behind the Big Red.
“The goal this weekend going into the regatta was to race hard and well,” Bonorris said. “We wanted to see if we could get a little more out of each stroke, squeeze a little more out of the oar into the water, building just a fraction more speed each stroke.”
Cornell took first place in both third varsity and the varsity four, in which Harvard did not compete. Penn finished in third for the first varsity eight at a time of 6:08.7, more than 13 seconds behind the Crimson.  They also fell to last place with the four boats and both freshmen races.
Heavyweight crew went head-to-head with Cornell in a duel race on Saturday. The Harvard first and second varsity eight boats took first place with a time of 5:37.4, three seconds ahead of Cornell in the first eight, and a time of 5:47.1, six seconds ahead of the Big Red for second. The Crimson took a big win in the freshman eight with a time of 5:49.1, eight seconds ahead of Cornell.
This was a good weekend for Ivy League racing, but Clemence warns that there is more to come.
“The other Ivy League crews such as Princeton and Yale have performed well in all their races to date,” he said. “I think we’ll need to build on this week’s performance and continue making the necessary improvements on the water.”
With its second weekend of its spring season over, Harvard looks keep improving as it progresses through its racing schedule.
“In the next few weeks a lot of Ivy League teams will be racing one another and a bit of a hierarchy will begin to form,” Bonorris said. “This is exciting and motivating, and it is important to remember that we are all looking forward to the end goal, which is the championship races. Week by week we look to improve and put in good results, all for the goal of the championship races.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the cold, the bats on the Harvard softball team were on fire in the first full weekend of Ivy League play.
The Crimson (16-11, 3-0 Ivy) went undefeated this weekend against Penn (7-14, 2-3) and Columbia (14-14, 4-4), winning three and storming back to tie up a game against the defending conference champion Quakers, which will be completed at a later date.
HARVARD 6, COLUMBIA 2
It was a full rotation effort from the Crimson in the second game of the doubleheader against Columbia. Freshman Taylor Cabe, junior Laura Ricciardone, and sophomore Morgan Groom combined to hold the Lions to two runs for the second straight game.
The Lions jumped out to their only lead of the doubleheader, scoring a run on a single in the top of the first.  That lead became two in the top of the fifth, when Columbia’s Liz Caggiano had a sacrifice fly.
But for the second time of the weekend, Harvard was able to come back and overcome the deficit. Junior Katherine Lantz had a bases-clearing double in the fifth to give the Crimson the lead, and the offense continued to rally, scoring five in that frame.
Both Groom and Ricciardone completed two-and-two-thirds innings, with Ricciardone receiving her eight win of the season.  The victory was Harvard coach Jenny Allard’s 500th of her career.
HARVARD 7, COLUMBIA 2
Ricciardone pitched a complete game to lead Harvard to victory against the Lions in the first game of the Sunday doubleheader.
The Crimson broke open the game early, scoring three runs in the second inning and four more in the third. Harvard strung together eight of its nine hits in these two innings, including an RBI single and a double from Lantz.
“We had some great offensive practices this week and last week,” Lantz said. “I think we are timing this Ivy League pitching pretty well.”
Ricciardone held the Lions the rest of the way, giving up two unearned runs while striking out seven batters.
HARVARD 8, COLUMBIA 8: SUSP/6
The Crimson stormed back to tie game two against the Quakers on Saturday before the umpires suspended the contest due to darkness. Harvard scored five runs in the bottom of the sixth to even up the score.
The Quakers earned an early lead thanks to a third-inning grand slam from Korinne Raby, who blasted the ball over the left-center wall with the bases loaded. The Crimson, however, managed to score three runs in the bottom of the next inning, although the rally was stopped when senior Allison Scott was called out at home plate.
After two straight two-run frames from Penn, the Crimson came up in the bottom of the sixth down five.  Two straight outs seemed to put Harvard in a hole, but then the rally began. Three batters later, the bases were loaded. Back-to-back errors by Penn’s shortstop allowed three Crimson runners to score. Then junior Adrienne Hume belted a double to left-center to tie the game, which will be finished at an undetermined time.
“Penn's a great team,” Lantz said. “We wanted a little bit of revenge after the games last year.”
HARVARD 8, PENN 3
The first game of the weekend appeared on paper to be a pitcher’s duel, pitting Ricciardone (2.38 ERA) against Penn’s Alexis Borden (1.99 ERA). But the Crimson bats went off for eight runs on eight hits to lead the team to a convincing win.
Harvard fell behind early on a solo shot from the Quakers’ Leah Allen in the top of the second. The Crimson, however, managed to come back in the bottom half of the inning and strung together hits to score three runs on back-to-back singles.
Penn and Harvard traded runs in the third inning, but the Crimson broke it open in the fifth with four runs on three hits, including an RBI single from junior Katherine Appelbe, who went 3-for-3.
From there, Ricciardone and junior Gabrielle Ruiz combined to hold Penn to just three runs.
“Penn was the defending Ivy League champs, and we were really ready for the games, “Ricciardone said. “We had a chip on our shoulder, and our offense never gave up.”

Spring has finally arrived! The sun is out (except that it rained almost all of last week), the snow is gone, and green is returning to campus. But despite the warmer weather, everyone seems to be getting sick. Here are some foolproof ways to stay healthy, brought to you by a proud germaphobe.
Avoid sharing drinks.Even if your friend’s iced coffee looks irresistible because you haven’t slept in days, don’t do it! Go walk yourself to the nearest dining hall or coffee shop of your choice and pick up your own. Start practicing this now, so that come the weekend, you’ll still remember to stick your own cup even if the rest of the night is a little fuzzy.
Open your windows.Did you know that one reason people get sick over the winter is because there is no air circulation and everyone is inside? Open your windows for fresh air. It will make your room feel less dusty, air out the stench of that forgotten Tasty Burger under your bed, and neutralize the smell of your still-damp snow boots.
Avoid plagued people.If you see anyone showing signs of sickness, steer clear. Move to the next desk in the library, don’t ask to borrow a pen from them in class, and if they’re your SO, do not touch them! Even if they say they’re fine, give yourself a 3-day buffer before resuming contact.
Wash your hands or use Purell.My least favorite part about the swine flu epidemic was not the fact that I had swine and strep at the same time and couldn’t get out of bed for a week, but that I had to use Purell multiple times a day for months. My dry hands may never forgive me, but at least the rest of those months were mostly illness free.
Don’t itch your eyes.This is a terrible habit. But anyone with allergies will tell you how this does not help their cause. Itchy eyes are bad. Itchy eyes plus a cold is the worst.
Overdose on vitamin C.Stock up on oranges or down emergen-C at least once a day. Nothing screams fighting off a cold quite like a large intake of vitamin C. (If you’re hardcore about strengthening your immune system, and don’t care if you stink, raw garlic is also a great immune booster.)

Harvard Students from the Yard to the Quad, it's finally safe to go outside! It’s a crazy thought, but bear with us. We have suffered through Boston’s oppressive winter and are now welcomed by the sweet relief of spring. Since you’ve grown used to the arctic tundra, you’re probably baffled by the sunlight and air that doesn’t hurt your face. Here are some tips for making the most of your long-awaited warmth.
1. Break out shorts and sundresses! Come on, skies out, thighs out. Show a little skin because you finally can without wanting to cry or getting hypothermia.
2. Throw on some stunner shades. Preferably some artsy sunglasses that say, “I reject all things mainstream.”
3. Now that you’re dressed for spring, get out there and enjoy it. Cambridge has a million special spots to bask in the majesty of 60-degree weather. Check out the benches down by the river. Get a tan, watch crew boats go by, and be happy that you don’t have to exert yourself.
4. Sit on top of the steps of Widener and some homework, or at least look like you are doing homework. Nothing is more Harvard. Plus, you never feel more superior than when you’re on the top step judging everyone. Just ask Blair Waldorf.
5. Chill in the Cambridge Commons. Toss around a Frisbee if you’re so inclined. Added bonus: no tourists will get in the way.
6. Sit outside and get an iced latté at Café Pamplona because you’re such a hipster.
7. If you’re a little more adventurous, take a jog about a mile or two down the river in the direction of BU. There’s outdoor exercise equipment! Gym AND tan. The cast of Jersey Shore would be so pleased.
8. Day drinking! You no longer have to just put on a booze blanket to stay warm. It’s now a celebratory activity. Turn up for sunlight. You have probably forgotten how this works (it’s been a while since Harvard-Yale). Luckily, Yardfest this Sunday will be the perfect time to get back into the swing of things.
9. If you see a flower or anything spring-related, Instagram it. Tag @Harvard and maybe if you are lucky they will regram!  #spring #sun #finally #sohappy #flower #beautiful #Cambridge #smile #loltoomanyhashtags.
Okay, now get off your computer and go outside!

Game of Thrones, the popular HBO series that premiered its fourth season Sunday night, takes place in a world of fantasy where everything is a cutthroat fight for power and money. Exactly like our lives at Harvard! We've drawn a few clear connections that'll make you realize our campus is basically Westeros. Be forewarned that there are spoilers below.
“Winter is Coming”
 GoT: In Game of Thrones, the people of the North are constantly bracing for winter. They even have a 700-foot ice wall to protect them from the wildlings who live beyond, which is manned by the Night’s Watch, a rugged group of rejects.
Harvard: At Harvard, we also spend our entire time here obsessing over winter. Complaining about being cold and busy is our 43rd varsity sport. And we’re well prepared for any attack from the wildings (AKA tourists). Even if they do manage to sneak in via Johnston gate, they can’t stop us from peeing on John Harvard’s foot and then telling them it’s lucky. And of course there is always our first line of defense—the quad—where we exile all our misfits.
“A Lannister always pays his debts.”
GoT: One of the strongest ruling families in Game of Thrones is the House of Lannister. Although they're known for honoring their word, they are mostly known for being powerful and having plenty of gold to go around.
Harvard: At Harvard, there are many parallels to the House of Lannister. There's Adams House, known for its gold and for literally being a House. But the closest thing to the House of Lannister has to be the Harvard Management Company. HMC CEO and President Jane L. Mendillo earned $5.3 million in 2013, and the company’s portfolio includes Harvard’s massive 30 billion dollar endowment. Talk about master of the coin.
Ruthless Leaders
 GoT: Speaking of scheming for power, in Game of Thrones everyone is constantly battling for ultimate control. Whether it’s arranged marriages between powerful families, alliances, or clever backstabbing, there are no boundaries. A prime example is the Red Wedding towards the end of season three, where the king of the North was killed. So were his wife and unborn child. And mother. And most of his bannermen. And his pet wolf (tear).
Harvard: At Harvard we have our own ruthless leaders, headed by the fearless and cunning Drew G. Faust. She will stop at nothing for world domination—examples include EdX, refusing to divest from fossil fuels, and shafting the UC. And boy does she have a history of backstabbing and blood on her hands. Look no further than former College dean Evelynn Hammonds who was set up and then sacrificed at Faust’s altar of ‘integrity’.  She’s a modern day Khaleesi. And don’t get us started on the similarities between Joffrey and Gus.
Supernatural Phenomena
 GoT: Game of Thrones takes place in a fantasy land. Dragons, sorceresses who give birth to king-murdering shadow demons, and blue-lipped self-cloning wizards are all examples of the kinds of subtle magic that happen throughout the show.
Harvard: There also are some strange things happening here on a daily basis, albeit on a smaller scale. How can every HUDS meal taste exactly the same even when they look and are named differently? How did 400 people show up to the Stat 104 midterm, when only 40 come to lecture? And how was the architect of the Graduate School of Design hired when all he had on his resume was “cement mixer”?
Rated for Mature Audiences only
 GoT: As viewers of GoT know, barely a minute of the show goes by without a naked body, a few “F” bombs, “C” words (the really bad one), graphic sex, or a gory kill (or usually all of them combined). The show is definitely NSFW and NSFDH (not safe for the dining hall).
Harvard: Similar to the world of Game of Thrones, as anyone who has ever attended a formal (especially Kirkland’s) knows, Harvard turns UP.
