After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t one of the five long three-point jumpers from sophomore guard Corey Johnson that allowed the Harvard men’s basketball team to pull away from Dartmouth on Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion. Nor was it a flashy dunk or emphatic block, of which there were many, by senior center Zena Edosomwan. Instead, the Crimson went back to basics, playing suffocating defense and getting good looks on the other end that led Harvard (10-5, 2-0 Ivy League) to a 82-68 victory over the Big Green (3-12, 0-2), its second win over the Big Green in two weeks.
Harvard rode a 15-4 run over a 3:56 stretch leading up to the second half’s second media timeout to bury its guests from Hanover. The Crimson built a 10-point lead that would only be cut to single digits once throughout the rest of the game. With his team down one, Edosomwan cleaned up a miss by sophomore guard Corey Johnson and laid home an errant Bryce Aiken layup on the next time down. Another Edosomwan layup was sandwiched between two layups from Aiken. Freshman forward Chris Lewis found classmate Seth Towns on a backdoor cut for an easy deuce. Co-captain Corbin Miller buried a three, Dartmouth coach David McLaughlin took a timeout, and, for all intents and purposes, the game was over.
“Coach Amaker always tells us our defense is the most important and that leads to offense,” Johnson said. “When we’re energized on defense and in the passing lanes, rebounding, getting that look in transition, the offense comes easy to us. It all starts on that end, so when once our defense picks up, the offense comes easy.”
On the defensive end, Harvard held the Big Green to two field goals and caused three turnovers during the run. The strong defense mirrored the play of the Crimson out of the gate. Harvard forced Dartmouth into misses on seven of its first eight field goal attempts, limiting the Big Green’s ability to get the ball inside and wreaking havoc on the perimeter.
“We did some things, trapping a little bit, we kind of sped it up and got them out of their rhythm,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Using our bench, we can do that to wear people down, and I thought that was a factor this afternoon.
After missing five of its first six shots, the Crimson began bringing on the triples. Harvard found itself up 10 before Dartmouth hit its second field goal of the afternoon. Five of the Crimson’s first six field goals were threes. Johnson led the party with two, with Aiken, Miller, and Towns also getting in on the fun. The lead was as many as 13 early.
However, the Big Green began finding holes in the Harvard defense and capitalizing on a bevy of offensive rebounds. Dartmouth went for 22 points in the first half’s final 8:27. The Big Green used six first half offensive boards and easy layups from backdoor cuts to chip away at the deficit. Junior guard Miles Wright buried a corner three to send Dartmouth into halftime with its first lead of the game. Wright wasn’t the only Boston native giving the Crimson fits in the second half. Sophomore guard Guilien Smith went into the break with 11 points in a half in which Harvard was able to keep reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year Evan Boudreaux under wraps.
After continuing to struggle to corral rebounds on the defensive end, Harvard made up for it on the offensive end. The first four-plus minutes of the second half saw four lead changes and a tie. Johnson and co-captain Siyani Chambers each hit a triple as the Crimson struggled to keep the Big Green away from missed jumpers and the free throw line. Rather than force more threes to try to keep pace, Edosomwan and company went back to basics.
“It kind of started off with our defensive tenacity,” Edosomwan said. “I think that a lot of our shots came from our defense getting stops, and it kind of energized us offensively and we were getting a lot of open shots and easy reads, but it definitely started with the defense.”
The effort was there, especially on the defensive end, down the stretch. Harvard held Dartmouth to 25 points over the game’s final 15:47. The Crimson had eight offensive rebounds of its own and outrebounded the Big Green, 18-14, in the second half. The Harvard lead grew to as many as 17 in the game’s final minutes, with many players ganging up to put the final touches on Dartmouth.
“We talked [at halftime] about how we need to do a much better job of getting on the offensive glass,” Amaker said. “Why can’t we keep balls alive, or get some extra possessions, or even score on the offensive glass? I thought Zena, his activity around the rim, being a presence, was a big difference in the game.”
Chambers had eight second half points while Johnson and Edosomwan both finished with 15. The Big Green did get to the line 27 times and was led by 33 points from its two sophomores, but it was Towns who led all scorers with 19 on an afternoon in which the Crimson shot 48.3 percent from the field and made 13 three-pointers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up until 9 p.m., the only goal siren that echoed throughout the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday was the result of a miscalculation.
Midway through the second period of the season’s first Harvard-Yale men’s hockey installment, senior forward Luke Esposito went tumbling into Bulldog goaltender Patrick Spano, knocking the puck off the pipe, then perhaps over the line beneath the two adversaries who had fallen into the cage.
The referees immediately, and rightfully, signaled no goal on the Esposito try, but that didn’t stop the sound operator from hitting the horn. Little did the 3,095 in attendance know, the erroneous siren was simply foreshadowing what was to come.
After the visiting Bulldogs (8-7-4, 4-5-3 ECAC) snapped a 56-minute stalemate off a tip-in from sophomore Ted Hart, Esposito retaliated with his second lamp-lighter of the evening just 1:09 later. And this one would count.
Just before falling over the stick of defenseman Henry Hart, senior Sean Malone threaded a pass from the right faceoff circle to the wide-open Esposito, who slipped to the far post while four Yale skaters had their eyes glued to Malone. The senior from Greenwich, Connecticut, then knocked the puck into the half-empty net with 2:07 remaining in regulation, helping the No. 6 Crimson (12-5-2, 8-4-2) earn a point in what amounted to a 1-1 draw against its archrival.
“We thought we had it won there late,” Yale coach Keith Allain said. “And they fought back and tied it up. I would say a tie would probably be the appropriate result for that game.”
“Certainly we would’ve liked to get the win,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But if you had asked me with two and a half minutes left, ‘Would I have taken the tie,’ we probably would have.”
One night after shutting out Brown, Crimson goaltender Merrick Madsen put together another impressive performance in net, stopping 27 shots. The only puck to get by the junior all weekend—the tip of a Robbie DeMontis shot from the side boards with 3:16 left—was the product of Hart and senior defenseman Clay Anderson standing right in front of him.
“I saw the puck redirect, and I reacted just as it got by me,” Madsen said. “I heard it nick off the post. So it’s tough obviously, you want to have those. But those are the bounces that happen in games like these.”
Over the last three years, there’s been something to be said about “games like these.” Five of the last six battles between Harvard and Yale have been decided by a goal or less, and neither side has scored more than three goals in any of them. Therefore, even with the Crimson boasting the top offense in the ECAC and the Bulldogs coming off a seven-goal outburst on Friday, both teams knew exactly what they were in for at the Bright.
“We knew it was going to be a one-goal game,” Madsen said. “It’s so hard, we have such a bitter rivalry with those guys that we just know going in there that it’s going to be tough to score…. Obviously we’re not satisfied [with the tie], but we went into the game knowing that it was going to be a tough one.”
Yet while the series has produced low scores as of late, Allain spoke after the game about how the scoring opportunities have always been there. On Saturday, Harvard had several such chances to pounce, particularly on four power plays—three of which came in the second period.
But Yale successfully completed all four of its kills against the country’s top man advantage, even without the services of Ryan Hitchcock, once a mainstay on the Bulldog kill before the junior broke his leg against St. Lawrence last weekend.
Donato said he felt his power play wasn’t sharp enough and attempted to be “too cute” with several of its chances. But he also credited Spano for having a hand in that.
Spano finished with 33 saves on the night, including 14 between the third period and overtime. Over the course of the Bulldogs’ current four-game unbeaten streak, Spano has compiled a .969 save percentage.
Early on, it appeared as though Spano might need to have a career night to keep the Crimson at bay, as the hosts peppered the netminder with seven shots over the first eight minutes and change. But the Yale defense buckled down and held Harvard without a shot on goal for the final 11 minutes of the opening period, resurrecting the theme of these recent wars of attrition between the rivals.
Each goalie made one signature save on the way to the finish line. Midway through the second period, Spano made a stellar stop with his right pad to deny sophomore Lewis Zerter-Gossage, who had a chance to rip home a juicy rebound in the slot. Madsen then produced his highlight with about 10 minutes to go in regulation, nabbing a Joe Snively wrister that had an eye for the top corner with his glove.
After the two sides exchanged late blows in the third, Malone had the best opportunity of the extra frame when the puck bounced onto his stick at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, but his wrister with 1:37 left was held by Spano.
For the time being, the tie drops Harvard to 13th in the PairWise rankings. But with the way Yale’s been playing as of late, the mathematical rankings likely won’t consider this game a ‘knock’ against the Crimson for long.
“Those are the types of games our group knows that we want to play in at the end of the season,” Donato said. “It’s a good barometer for us to see… what kind of commitment we’re going to need to make on and off the ice to have success in a game like that.”

Welcome back, Harvard!
We get it, being back on campus elicits a pretty confusing mix of emotions. You're simultaneously excited to be freed from the "tyranny" of being home and also mourning the end of break. We've all been there. Still, it doesn't mean you are exempt from social protocol. Here are some classic post-break faux pas to avoid:
 
Bragging about doing the reading already
We all know it’s not true, so don’t waste our time. Worse yet, if it is true, you should really keep that to yourself. You’re only asking to lose friends. No one wants to feel like a disappointment before even getting to the first class. And also try to hide your enthusiasm for the Q Guide review of Hormones and Behavior. We know you want to be “satisfied in every way possible,” but please be less of a try hard while doing it.
False promises about a “New Year, New You”
Your parents may have congratulated you on your New Year’s resolution to keep your room clean, but your roommates know better. Don’t get their hopes. They know that within a half an hour of your return the contents of your suitcase will be strew haphazardly across the common room. And if you think you're going to suddenly be organized now because you bought a pretty planner, think again. No amount of color-coding can change a person, and really, all you did was waste thirty bucks for a fancy Moleskin.
Showing off your "exotic" holiday
We saw enough of your beach photos on Instagram for a lifetime. No, we don't really care about your tan, and neither should you—no one will see it under your winter coat and it'll likely be gone by midterms. Those of us who spent our break binge watching Netflix don’t deserve the shame of hearing about your foray into the tropical rain forest or your nights chilling around bonfires on the beach. Spare us from the FOMO.
Bragging about your presents: 
This is elementary. As in, the sort of stuff you learn not to do in grade school. Seriously, we could have bought 6 Mankiw textbooks for the price of that Canada Goose jacket. Christmas, Hannukah, and Kwanza were almost a month ago. We’re over it, and frankly, you should be too.
Refusing to share the food your parents sent back with you: 
Leftover peppermint bark? Homemade banana bread? We know you’re hiding it under your bed, and that is just really inconsiderate. No one likes a food hog.
We are happy to see you, and we definitely want it to stay that way. But if you try to pull any of these moves on us, we will have to tell you in a not-so-nice way: dude, that’s rude.
