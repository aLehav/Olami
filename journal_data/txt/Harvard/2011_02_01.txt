Ilinca Radulian ’11’s passion lies behind the scenes of Harvard’s stages, where she can develop her vision as a director. Last December, she directed “Inland Empire,” an adaptation of the novel by James Buchanan, in Adams Pool Theatre.
The Harvard Crimson: How old were you when you became involved in theater?
Ilinca Radulian: About five, I’d say. I’ve been doing it all of my life, but I prefer directing. I started as a stage manager because I wanted to learn about the underbelly. Then I moved to producing and being an assistant.
THC: When has theater been most challenging for you—the most problematic production or the most difficult incident?
IR: Every production is problematic. There’s not really a project that doesn’t have problems, but those problems get smoothed out. The last week is when it really all happens. That’s when all the elements get juxtaposed, finally, and you are able to see if it all works together. The most problematic production was “Inland Empire,” inspired by the David Lynch movie of the same name. It didn’t go wrong, but was hard to deal with on many levels. Logistically, the production took place throughout Adams House. Scenes took place en route to somewhere else, and there were three different intersecting threads of narrative. I was the only director. It was an enormous amount of information to hold in your head.
THC: What was “Inland Empire: about?
IR: It’s about a woman with a fragmented identity. She starts being an actress, then she begins to take on the persona of her role, then she becomes the archetype behind that persona. It’s like a series of successive rabbit holes with nothing at the end. It was a very emotionally difficult piece to direct, because the problem of identification became something I had to handle every day. There were so many valences of identity, and I felt like I was losing some of my own, as well.
THC: Did you use any visual symbols in your construction of the piece?
IR: Well, that’s the thing about theater. Everything you put on stage immediately becomes a symbol. I had a  cake and a hollow womanly figure shaped from six wedding dresses within one another on the table. Then six actresses each ate cake, took a white dress, and put it on. There ended up being 12 actors at that table—sort of like the Last Supper—with the 13th figure being the one shaped from the dresses.
THC: How do you think the audience felt about the production?
IR: I can never really know. How the audience felt about it is sort of the ultimate test of a performance.  Since I’m not the audience, my test is to ask myself whether or not I’m bored on the 100th iteration of a play I’ve directed.
THC: What is it like to interact with the actors as a director?
IR: It all depends on how you treat them. Your aim is to cast something well. It’s challenging because there are all kinds of actors. Last spring I directed “The Pillowman” in the Loeb Black Box Theater. I had this set idea of how it’s supposed to end, but one of my actors said “I don’t think that’s what that scene is all about.” It was scary. I said, “Two things. Can we talk about how you think it should end, and, are you still willing to go with the way we have it?” He agreed, reluctantly, and I ended up talking to him and deciding that his ending was far better than the previous one. Actors can have fantastic ideas—it was scary, though, as a director, to have someone say that to you.
THC: Theatrically, who are some of your influences?
IR: I basically get influenced by everything I see. Theater is all about stealing. It’s dangerous to have favorite directors. You end up becoming them, and then you are nothing more than a copy.
THC: When have you felt most yourself as a director?
IR: Probably during “Inland Empire.” In theater, you want to tell the truth—and the scary thing is that telling the truth can be like pulling this heavy, horrible, convoluted thing out of the ground. It’s difficult, too, because if you want to tell the truth about yourself, you have to be comfortable with yourself. This was a time in my life when I wasn’t comfortable with me. My personal life was very difficult. And it became scary, because for a while I was afraid that I’d stopped loving theater, that my love for it had dried up. It’s terrifying when you think it’s going to get up and walk out the door on you. What else do you have? But it didn’t slam the door.

On February 3 at Symphony Hall, the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) will be showcasing works by fashion students from around the Boston area. Project Beethoven, the BSO’s third annual fashion contest, is a part of Symphony+, which features pre- and post-concert events for patrons of the symphony. Last year, the fashion contest was called “Project Tchaikovsky;” in its first year, it was named “Project Mozart.”
Each year, contestants are asked to design a piece of evening wear inspired by the given composer. The selected designs are then featured in a fashion show at Symphony Hall, paired with a performance of the composer’s music by the BSO. This year, the BSO will perform Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 3 with pianist Radu Lupu. “What happens is before the concert on February 3, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m., the models stroll through the hall and the public spaces, and the patrons who come at that time can vote for their favorites,” says Sarah L. Manoog, the BSO’s Director of Marketing who developed Project Mozart three years ago. There will also be a panel of judges from various members of the fashion and music community in Boston. The winner will be announced at a post-concert event in Higginson Hall.
Project Beethoven and its past incarnations hoped to provide a large creative space for its contestants. “The assignment is very open and gives a lot of room for interpretation,” says Manoog. “Some people take it very literally, and they really listen to the music and design evening wear that has music notes on it.”
Others, like Maria E. Canada, a second-year student at Rhode Island School of Design, took a more historical approach to Project Beethoven. She chose to focus on Beethoven himself. “The design stemmed from that classic portrait of Beethoven with him in the red cravat and the black coat,” says Canada. “I decided to draw my inspiration for the design from his actual portrait and attempt to put that into the modern-day evening wear.” By providing such a broad creative outlet, Project Beethoven and its predecessors give fashion students around Boston a special venue to flex their creative muscles. “I’m in my first year, so I’m doing a lot of technical training. For me it was a chance to do something that would be more creative,” says Canada.
Symphony+ events such as Project Beethoven also give patrons of the BSO an experience that differs from an ordinary visit to the symphony. “One feedback that we got is that it gave patrons something to talk about one another during the modeling time,” says Manoog. “There’s a great camaraderie and excitement, whereas typically before a concert people are more to themselves.”
Project Beethoven also opens the doors of Symphony Hall for people not usually drawn to the BSO. “We get a lot of students, and friends of the designers who have been selected,” says Manoog. “The people of the fashion community in the Boston scene also really like to come.”

Dunster House Dining Hall
Directed by Matt A. Aucoin ’12 & Matthew C. Stone ’11
Produced by Chappell L.W. Sargent ’12 & Julian B. Gewirtz ’13
Love, revenge, and drunken joy return to Dunster House Dining Hall’s ‘stage’ in February. The Dunster House Opera (DHO) will once again present “Die Fledermaus” (The Bat), a show first performed at Harvard 16 years ago. “It’s not just the best operetta. It’s ‘the’ operetta,” says music director Matt A. Aucoin ’12.
Johann Strauss’s operetta tells the tale of Gabriel von Eisenstein (Benjamin J. Nelson ’11), who decides to attend his friend’s costume ball despite being sentenced to eight days in jail. His wife Rosalinde (Bridget P. Haile ’11), believing her husband to be incarcerated, seizes the opportunity to partake in the festivities, and chaos ensues before a Viennese backdrop of glittering waltzes and spirited drinking songs.
“This show has something that we can all sort of relate to,” says stage director Matthew C. Stone ’11, a Crimson arts editor. “Every character has a streak of capriciousness and indulgence, and as much as they might try to resist, there’s a part of them that will give in—something that we all do.”
In this respect, Stone and Aucoin believe “Die Fledermaus” truly reflects DHO’s goal to make opera accessible to everyone at Harvard. The music is also perfect for undergraduates to sing and to enjoy. As Aucoin explains, “Every instant has a tune that you cannot get out of your head. Each number can stand alone.”
“I’ve been astounded with the quality of singers and performers and directors involved in this production,” says producer Julian B. Gewirtz ’13. All of these collective talents are working toward one goal: to move and inspire their audience.
“I hope they’ll laugh and cry and dance and go home feeling uplifted and sad the way these characters constantly are,” says Aucoin.

In a much lampooned interview—his first after being acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008—R. Kelly pledged to Black Entertainment Television (B.E.T) that his next album would feature less explicitly sexual material. Other hilarious responses —“When you say teenage, how old are we talking?”—aside, the idea that R. Kelly could write an enjoyable album without his signature candid carnality roused skepticism at best—which is what made “Love Letter,” released just in time for the holiday season, such a pleasant surprise. From its cover—a sepia-toned photo of Kels crooning to the heavens in which he looks like a young Ray Charles in sunglasses and a bowtie—to its suspiciously innocuous tracklist (no trace of the words “sex” or “body”), Kelly’s 10th studio album seemed poised to present an unfamiliar experience for many of his fans. The wonder, then, is that R. Kelly still seduces while producing one of his finest and most accessible albums yet.
One of the keys to Kelly’s longevity has always been that he operates so well in both sexual and spiritual modes—that the same man who wrote “Bump n’ Grind” wrote “I Believe I Can Fly”—but this album fuses the two in a way that he has never attempted. Kelly remains shamelessly frank, even over the top about his love for women, but here his passion seems whole, grateful, and uncharacteristically devoid of egotism. “Love Letter” proves that Kelly can achieve and convey transcendence through the redeeming power of love and not just through meditations on his own greatness.
This is not to say that Kelly is not great in his usual mode—and his gift for groove and arrangement is only highlighted here by liberal use of classic soul orchestration. As its title suggests, this is an album of declarations across great distances. “Did you get my card?” asks the excellent, pulsating title track; “Can you hear me?” pleads the impassioned “Radio Message.” But it’s also about a certain spirit of holiday giving, and Kelly is nothing if not generous. He takes a moment at the outset to dedicate the record to all of his female listeners. Indeed the album’s mood is often one of camaraderie, as he shows on his “remix” to “Love Letter,” which is essentially the same song plus Christmas lyrics and sleigh bells: “Kels is having a Christmas party and everybody’s V.I.P.!” It’s hard not to smile at both versions’ exhaustive toast to all things good, including “cocktails, happy hours, wedding bells, baby showers / Vacations, sail boats, with the ones you love the most,” and it soon ceases to matter whether your grin is borne of ridicule or genuine happiness.
But it’s not all happy hours and baby showers on “Love Letter,” and Kelly is most impressive when he slips out of his contemporary R&B groove and goes straight soul. Whether grappling with the frustration of a lover grown distant on “Not Feelin’ the Love” or the anguish of parting from a loved one on “How Do I Tell Her,” Kelly is consistently raw and convincing. The swelling strings of grandiose first single “When A Woman Loves”—the classy, black-and-white video of which was our initial glimpse of the album way back in August—perhaps showcase this classic influence best, and the song is one of his most heartfelt ballads in years.
The album’s crowning achievement is “Love Is,” a male/female duet featuring up-and-coming K. Michelle of the same label. The two proclaim their mutual affection in unabashedly delightful terms (“Might as well call me a telegram, baby / ’Cause darling, that’s just how you send me”) and the upbeat rhythms twinkle euphorically from start to finish. If this song is any indication, K. Michelle—who holds her own with the self-proclaimed king of R&B—is one to watch, especially as her Kelly-produced debut album drops soon.
Though masterfully crafted on the whole, there are probably a few too many tracks on “Love Letter.” “Just Can’t Get Enough,” while smooth, is an uninspired attempt at a Marvin Gaye slow jam, and “Taxi Cab” is the album’s only true misstep, a clumsy “Latin-influenced” account of—surprise—having sex in a cab with a stranger. It goes without saying that there are guitar solos and mojitos involved.
As he continues to demonstrate on guest appearances and remixes, even at 44 Kels can still strut like his every verse spontaneously induces breeding. But “Love Letter” shows us he’s equally potent when he keeps it PG-13. As he sings on “Love Is,” “Felt a whole lot of things, but nothing’s ever felt like this.” His fans should feel the same.

February 11-12, 8:00 and 10:00 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Graham H. Lazar ’12
Produced by Aneliese K. Palmer ’12
For the Immediate Gratification Players (IGP), Harvard’s only long-form improvisational comedy troupe, life imitates art. As they prepare for “Laugh Riot Festival XIII: Livin’ on Da Edge,” which runs in the Loeb Drama Center’s Experimental Theater from February 11 to 12, the troupe accomplishes a number of feats in less than twenty minutes. They create an intermission snack featuring AMP Energy Drink and Fiery Hot Cheetos, brainstorm a promotional video, and reinterpret the festival’s theme of ‘extreme feats.’
The festival’s director, Graham H. Lazar ’12, does the latter. “My understanding of the theme, or what I would like it to be, is that we are exploring the limits of human experience,” says Lazar, citing sky diving and living in a convent as two contrasting examples.
Though IGP normally performs in Fong Auditorium, which IGP’s Czar Benjamin W.K. Smith ’12 terms their “home court”, the troupe intends to make full use of the black box theater to create a theatrical experience while keeping the comedy thoroughly improvised. Last year’s festival featured planets hanging from the ceiling. This year’s decorations will be an opening night surprise.
Behind IGP’s spontaneity lies thoughtful consideration. Unlike most national comedy festivals, according to the members of IGP, Laugh Riot allows each visiting troupe two sets in order to make their journet worthwhile. IGP also offers a free workshop taught by a comedy professional. This year, Laugh Riot coincides with a national comedy festival at Skidmore College and thus certain troupes from years past will not be attending. However, there are two new additions to this year’s lineup: Dead Serious, a troupe from Wellesley College, and 8th Floor from Ohio State University.
“If you don’t like it you’ll get your money back,” producer Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 deadpans. If the intermission snack featuring AMP, IGP’s sole sponsor, and the promotional video spoofing the film “127 Hours” are not enticing enough, Palmer gives another reason to attend. “It’s between when you eat dinner and when you go out, so it’s not like you’re doing anything,” says Palmer. After the show, “you’re going to be much more excited for life,“ she adds. “Because it’s time for the parties,” chimes in Smith.

There is an app for everything—even album-making. Damon Albarn’s latest brainchild, “The Fall,” was recorded while on tour by using iPad applications like Speak It!, Dub Siren Pro, Mugician, and Solo Synth. Despite its interesting origin, the album pales in comparison to previous studio-recorded Gorillaz records in replacing their minimalism and typically impeccable songwriting with overbearingly digitized arrangements. However, its raw, studio-free yet highly technological sound is striking, and, at times, adds new dimensions to the songs. Damon Albarn maintains some of his power to form densely emotional songs, but the limitations and distractions of the iPad overcome the songs on “The Fall.”
Albarn’s unorthodox recording method hinders the musical quality that Gorillaz fans have come to expect. Some songs consist only of technological gimmicks and fail to achieve the thoughtfully produced sound of other Gorillaz albums like “Plastic Beach.” For instance, album opener “Phoner to Arizona,” comes across as little more than a collection of heavy, creeping synths battling the resounding bass. In “Little Plastic Bags,” Albarn indulges in a 45-second intro of dull, windy synthesizers that delay and then obscure the song itself. The longing in Albarn’s lyrics and singing effectively suggest the feelings of a journey made in isolation, but their effect is hidden behind heavy iPad synthesizers.
The album’s most poignant moments arise from the juxtaposition of the digital landscapes that Albarn creates and the darker organic sound of his voice. On “Revolving Doors,” the first vocal track on the album, Albarn sings wistfully, “Revolving doors what have I done ... Revolving doors what will I become?” These lyrics, and the tone of his voice stand in tragic and fragile contrast with the catchy bassline and deceptively upbeat ukulele, and “Revolving Doors” is one of the most powerful tracks on the album as a result.
On rare occassions, Albarn succeeds in his purely digital pursuits. He creates overwhelming aural chaos on “The Joplin Spider.” Psychedelic synthesizers—which would have been at home on the original soundtrack to “Tron”—combine with heavily processed vocals and a dubstep melody suggestive of M.I.A.’s trademark distorted sound. But, more often than not, the combination of too many superfluous, purely digital sounds destroys the artistry of Albarn’s songwriting and leaves the music feeling self-indulgent and inaccessible.
As this album was written and recorded in transit between tour stops on the most recent Gorillaz tour of North America, there is a tangible sense of movement—the songs rise and fall in volume and frequently shift moods, evoking rolling landscapes and winding highways. “California and the Slipping of the Sun” begins with the sounds of waiting passengers and a train station loudspeaker. The train station sounds slowly melt into acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and eventually a techno beat. The song is one of the album’s more moving and dynamic tracks.
There is also an honest, spontaneous quality to the core of this music, which perhaps stems from the fact that the album was created on the road within 30 days. “HillBilly Man” continues Albarn’s trend of unexpected yet engaging musical choices: a calm, pensive beginning suddenly transitions into minimalist, electronic sounds and scratchy turntables. Damon Albarn’s pleading falsetto gently lilts over the sounds, and the contrast between the  disparate sounds is is poignant.
Though the highly portable medium of the iPad differs from standard recording methods, the album’s excessive reliance on technology causes it to lose the more human qualities of Albarn’s songwriting. Though appealing in the abstract, the album itself is underwhelming.

It’s your typical rock and roll success story: Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley, a married couple from Denver, decide to sail along the Atlantic coastline and wind up writing songs about their voyage, calling their band Tennis. The resulting debut album, “Cape Dory,” is all pastels and conch shells—a breezy, half-hour collection of lo-fi pop tunes with lyrics about sailing and the joys of vacation. The songs and lyrics are simple, but they correspond perfectly with the escapist feel of the album. Is “Cape Dory” revolutionary? Not particularly. Is it edgy? Certainly not. It is nonetheless a tremendously enjoyable pop album from two musicians with superb melodic sensibilities and a gift for constructing catchy hooks.
Moore sets the tone of the album fairly quickly on the opener, “Take Me Somewhere,” the chorus of which consists of incessant cooing of the track’s title. The lyric serves as a mission statement for the remainder of the album—the central theme of “Cape Dory” is escapism, but not in the traditional rock and roll sense of the word.
The tone of the album is innocuous. Rather than escaping a meager existence à la “Born to Run,” Moore and Riley simply want to take a vacation. On “Bimini Bay,” Moore muses, “We’ve been gone for so very long / That we’ve forgotten where we are from.” She expresses a similar sentiment on “Seafarer,” when she recounts her affair with a sailor that made her leave “[her] home and friends behind.” The lyrics do not exhibit the slightest degree of urgency or genuine concern; instead they suggest a bemused acceptance of her lifestyle.
On “Baltimore,” Moore wonders aloud in one of the album’s inadvertently humorous moments, “Can we get a job?” This line provides a rare break from the album’s carefree atmosphere, as the only time in which a real world concern emerges. In many cases, Moore and Riley do not even waste time with substantive lyrics—some of the album’s most memorable choruses consist entirely of nonsense syllables.
The themes of “Cape Dory” may not be particularly complex—no one would accuse lyrics such as “Coconut grove is a very small cove / Separated from the sea by a shifting shoal” of being particularly deep—but the real appeal of the album lies in Moore and Riley’s gift for inescapable pop hooks. Songs like “Marathon” and “Long Boat Pass” consist primarily of simple organ melodies and surf-rock guitars, and find them appropriating the ethos and instrumentation of their prep-pop peers, Vampire Weekend.
Tennis’s musical sound itself is an appealing hybrid. Tracks like the gently swaying “Pigeon” and “Bimini Bay” feature the silky smooth coos and whispers of frontwoman Alaina Moore, which recall the vocal stylings of 1960s girl groups like the Shangri-Las. Building on their classic pop influences, Moore and Riley then layer their songwriting with loud, squalling guitars and lo-fi drum cascades. The combination of these two very different styles creates an interesting contrast on the racing “South Carolina,” on which Moore’s voice soars over chugging guitar lines and a constant sheen of cymbals. The slow-burning closer “Waterbirds” opens as a mellow shuffle and then climaxes into a cacophony of jagged blues riffs. Lo-fi pop is nothing new, but Tennis’s exceptionally pristine vocal arrangements enrich “Cape Dory” with a distinctive sound that is simultaneously fresh and familiar.
Despite the album’s fairly uniform melodic and tonal ideas of relaxation, it is a credit to the band’s song craft that the album’s energy never flags. Songs like “Take Me Somewhere” and the title track exhibit abrupt tempo changes that keep them interesting. In terms of album dynamics, Moore and Riley wisely sequence the tracks, alternating between up-tempo and down-tempo songs.
Moore sings on the title track, “Do you want to go where it never snows?” Though the listener may not need to flee a wintry climate, the message of “Cape Dory” isn’t specific to any one particular time and place. At its heart, “Cape Dory” is an album about spending time enjoying the company of someone you love—regardless of location or season, and it brings a charming summer ease to even the coldest winter months.

“To see, and to be shown, is now the will and new expectancy of half mankind,” wrote Henry Robinson Luce in his 1936 prospectus for LIFE Magazine. This simple yet powerful idea and its impact on 20th- century American art proved to be compelling topics of discussion at a January 29 lecture held at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The lecture, entitled “LIFE Magazine’s Key Role in the Promotion of American Modernism,” was given by Melissa Renn, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Research Associate in the Division of European and American Art at the Harvard Art Museums.
Renn’s lecture, the first of three in the Sackler Museum’s series entitled “Modernism Comes to the Americas, 1940–1960,” explored the diversity of LIFE Magazine’s coverage of art and architecture from the ‘30s to the ‘60s. In an hour-long presentation, Renn highlighted important events in LIFE’s 36-year history, from its inception by Henry Luce in 1936 to its promotion of Regionalist, figurative, and abstract painters, female and African-American artists, and even modern architects.
Specifically, her talk emphasized LIFE Magazine’s “remarkable and hitherto unrecognized influence” on American modernism’s reception as well as on the American art world as whole.
“LIFE’s impact on American culture is undeniable,” Renn says. The magazine not only featured some of the most recognized American artists of the century—including Georgia O’Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, and Frank Lloyd Wright—but in the process, it also made the art world directly accessible to the average American and revolutionized the way Americans consumed both popular culture and fine art.
After its launch in 1936, LIFE Magazine became immensely popular, its circulation reaching 1.6 million within a year and peaking at 13.5 million weekly readers in the ‘40s. With its considerable influence, the publication promoted the nation’s art world, through what Renn identifies as “the roles of educator, patron, curator, and critic.”
These roles, however, were divorced from neither politics nor nationalism. “The future of the art world lies here rather than abroad,” declared Henry Luce in 1939. Explaining what she calls Luce’s “deep desire to see art become a part of American life and have it inspire and unite Americans,” Renn says, “he saw art as having a key role in both ensuring a democratic society and making the 20th century the American century.”
VES concentrator Remeike J. B. Forbes ’11 echoes this idea, saying that. in the early 20th century, “there was this idea that the U.S. still hadn’t developed a unique and vibrant artistic tradition of its own.” Many artists, he continues, thus shared a common goal: “to create a national art tradition linked to the history, traditions, and culture of the American people.”
Event attendee Marcelo Cerullo ’10 notes that he was surprised by LIFE’s importance in promoting American art. “It was particularly interesting how Melissa Renn weaved in images and paintings that I had taken as characteristically American, but that I didn’t know had been disseminated through LIFE,” says Cerullo.
The next two lectures of the Sackler’s “Modernism Comes to the Americas, 1940–1960” series will both be presented by Harvard Art Museums curators. Theodore E. Stebbins Jr. will discuss “Who Discovered Jackson Pollock? And Why?” on February 12, and Mary Schneider Enriquez will discuss “‘Invention over Imitation’: Modernism in 1940s Argentina” on March 5.
In the meantime, art lovers can still enjoy important 20th-century works on their own. The Sackler Museum currently houses several American modernist paintings. Among them are Georgia O’Keeffe’s 1925 painting “Red and Pink” and Charles Sheeler’s 1929 painting “Upper Deck,” which were once reproduced in LIFE.

“At Harvard, people who make art or participate in art often stop when they get to college. But it seems that it should be a part of everyday life, like an important part of being a person,” says Christine S. An ’11. An was a participant in the creative writing workshop, “‘All the Architectures I Am’: Structure as Revolution in Contemporary Poetry,” one track in Harvard’s first Optional Winter Activities Week (OWAW) January Arts Intensives. These specialty-related workshops were made available during the January term to students who wished to return to campus and immerse themselves in art without the anxiety of semester coursework.
These intensives were directed by various instructors in creative writing, design, comedy, theater, and dance. All were renowned in their respective arts; visual artist Jen J. Bervin taught the creative writing intensive, Professor of Architectural Theory K. Michael Hays instructed the design intensive “Architectural Fictions,” and comedians Jane F. Condon and Jimmy Tingle ran the comedy program. In addition, the American Repertory Theater’s Institute for Advanced Theater Training and Liz Lerman and The Dance Exchange instructed “Big Story, Little Story: structure, language, body,” a workshop with both dance and theater tracks.
The OWAW comedy intensive running from January 17 to 21 received particular attention. Condon and Tingle, who have both been featured comedians on prime-time television shows, made sure that all participants in the workshop got on their feet and performed every day of the program. After a week of practice, the students performed in front of a large audience at Hong Kong Restaurant in Harvard Square on Friday, January 21. Though Rumur J.H. Dowling ’14 had to be persuaded to participate in the intensive by a friend, he found that he had gained much more than a few stand-up jokes by the end of the week. “Comedy writing is deceptively intellectual,” he says. “The comedic theory and the techniques used to draw comedy out of personal experience are very compatible with methods that writers use to connect with their readers.”
Bervin’s creative writing workshop was also a unique feature of the January Arts Intensives. Bervin, a poet and visual artist, has published several books that juxtapose art and poetry, including “The Dickinson Composites” and “The Desert.” With the help of curator Christina S. Davis, Bervin pushed her students to think outside the box and view creative writing in ways they never had before. “It was nice to see Harvard students—who are stereotypically great at everything—try being uncomfortable, and then finally succeeding,” Bervin says. “I was very moved by the group.”
Bervin forced her students to use obscure techniques to make different kinds of art. In one instance, she instructed participants to write left-handed and see what kinds of figures would emerge. In another, she asked them to use typewriters to make various forms of graphic art on paper. “We spent a lot of time looking at the process of creating poetry and rethinking what poetry can be,” An says. “It’s often in print and confined to the page in black type, but we got to see how it can go further than that.”
The structure of the workshops was exploratory and laid-back; instructors emphasized that no work was a failure. “This was like week one of what would be a three-week course, because the whole thing is a constant work in progress,” Bervin says.
The experts of OWAW’s January Arts Intensives not only presented new skills, but novel perspectives on incorporating art into the daily lives of students like An and Dowling. “There’s an expression that life is tough—you either laugh about it or you cry about it,” Dowling says. “Within this comedy intensive, the point of it was that each day you definitely laugh about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The King Is Dead” is as close as the Decemberists will come to writing a Taylor Swift album. It marks a return to rootsy, American folk and rock for the Portland quintet, whose previous works swung loosely from soft alternative to indie folk to haunting classical baroque. It delivers the clean, affirming satisfaction of a great pop-rock album—but it fails to enthrall or captivate, lacking the transcendent lyrical force that made the Decemberists’ previous work exceptional.
A focus on lyrical content has always been at the core of the Decemberists’ unique musical identity. Over all of their previous five LPs, frontman Colin Meloy has emerged as a lyrical visionary, equal parts Bruce Springsteen and Shakespeare. He has made the band’s name—spinning complex, fairytale epics and wildly varied character sketches with a command of language and metaphor as thrilling as the stories they present. The Decemberists support their exceptional lyrics with strong musicianship, and they capably blend a multitude of styles to create robust backdrops for their tales. However, it was always the lyrics that carved out the band’s exceptional niche in indie rock.
“The King Is Dead” gets a fair amount right, but it falters in diluting the band’s usual focus on lyrical mettle. Often, the content is lacking—abstract pieces like “Rise To Me” and “This Is Why We Fight” find the band emphasizing the music over their lyrical strength, replacing Meloy’s thrillingly convoluted poetry with simple rhymes and uninventive phrases like “I am going to stand my ground / You rise to me and I’ll blow you down.”
Unsurprisingly, the album’s most engaging tracks are marked by a return to strong lyricism. “January Hymn” and “June Hymn” are beguiling, deceptively simple stories of lost love and domestic life; “Rox In The Box” lets its humorously bitter sketch of Montana coal miners drive the track. Meloy makes use of his extravagant lexicon on “Calamity Song,” lashing out gleefully with obtuse poetry like “And the Panamanian child / Stands at the dowager empress’s side.”
These songs that show off Meloy’s songwriting are in the minority on the album, and “The King Is Dead” too often lets its accesible music interfere with their lyrics. The result is the band’s richest, most confident and most enjoyable instrumental production, a smorgasbord of folksy anthems which fuse strident harmonica, acoustic strumming, punchy drums, and powerfully shimmering guitar. However, the music dominates most tracks, frequently appearing to be an attempt to make up for a lack of lyrical content.
The shift of focus from lyrics to music was not necessarily a bad choice—bands change, and a Decemberists’ album lacking their lyrical prowess might have remained strong had their musicianship only been as exceptional. Instead, they shortchange their signature lyricism, replacing it with music that, while accessible, is ultimately unable to fully compensate for what they gave up.
Pop sensibility rarely—if gloriously—surfaced in the Decemberists’ previous work, but “The King Is Dead” is full of pop-rock gold.  The songs are built in sturdy simple rock formats that bare brilliantly catchy hooks and rise into confident, anthemic choruses. Unlike every Decemberists LP before it, “The King Is Dead” hits with a refreshingly simple gut satisfaction. Unfortunately, the Decemberists treat their lyrics almost as obstacles to this pop perfection, where their best songs combine their pop sensibilities with their distinctive lyrical style.
“The King Is Dead” is a pop gem with distinct Decemberists flair—the tracks that allow themselves to shine by maintaining focus on the Decemberists’ usual lyrical artistry while adding new pop-rock music elements are some of their best. Just as they add touches of unique intrigue to the album’s straight-forward pop appeal, though, those tracks are reminders of how much was sacrificed in the rest of the album. Even in creating a pop-rock delight of full, satisfying simplicity, the Decemberists need not have underdeveloped the lyricism that has always made them extraordinary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I don’t know if I would call painting so relaxing... you’re almost sometimes fighting with the paint,” says beginner painter Jane Chun ’12. Though she is a Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) concentrator, Chun had never tried painting before she took a studio course last semester.
Not all aspiring artists have as much access as Chun, particularly those who are not already in the VES department. Limited resources, further constrained by the financial crisis, have prevented the expansion of technical arts classes within the VES department and outside the academic curriculum—most notably in courses offered by the Office for the Arts (OFA). As a result, the few existing classes are forced to reject many applicants, and students who seek to learn a visual art form outside their concentration may be compelled to look for training outside the College.
Even Harvard students with no previous art experience regularly demonstrate enormous commitment to the visual arts, and many are extremely satisfied with their artistic experiences at the College. However, as with everything at Harvard, success in learning new skills within the visual arts can require an investment of blood, sweat, and tears.
A MYSTIQUE
The VES department currently lists 32 studio courses in the course catalogue; as with every department, many of these classes are not offered every year. Though 16 of them are open to students with no previous studio experience, all of them restrict class size to either 10 or 12 students, and VES concentrators usually receive preference over non-concentrators.
Katarina A. Burin, a Visiting Professor in the VES department, taught VES 10a: “Drawing 1” last semester, which had not been offered since fall 2007. According to Burin, over 40 people wanted to take her course, but she was only able to accept 14—two more than the department suggests for such a class.
“Unfortunately you can’t have more than about 14,” she says. “It just has to be, with resources [the way they are]. It started to be hard to get everybody’s work up on the wall. Unfortunately, there’s no way to allow for more.” At some point, inclusivity and high quality instruction become mutually exclusive options.
This cap prevents many from taking courses they would like to, although both professors and students insist that the classes are still accessible to people from all backgrounds. Burin determined admission to her class based on face-to-face interviews, then chose to admit people based on their enthusiasm and her desire to have a diverse class body. Just three of the students admitted were VES concentrators, and many were complete novices.
One of those novices was Pilar M. Mayora ’12, a Computer Science concentrator with no drawing experience, who wanted to learn the art in order to be able to do more work in computer graphics. “I was pretty happy that I had no experience,” says Mayora, who felt that her lack of background made her a perfect candidate for an introductory course.
Less compelling applicants weren’t so lucky. “I had two or three solid classes’ [worth of people] that could have been good.” Burin said.  “They just don’t have the foundations classes anymore. It was clear to me that a lot of people craved direction and the basics.” Harvard’s tightening fiscal belt, however, makes an increase in the number of classes unlikely to happen anytime in the near future.
Despite the competitive admissions process, Director of Undergraduate Studies for VES Department Ruth S. Lingford disagrees that it is hard for students to get into VES classes, provided that they are committed enough. “There’s a mystique about how difficult it is to get into VES classes,” Lingford said. “I think students tell each other it’s difficult to get into a VES class. Some are very oversubscribed, but if students are willing to be broad-minded and shop a few different classes they can usually get into at least one.” It follows, then, that students interested in a particular art medium may have to settle for a different form.
MAKING SPACE
Outside of VES, students have the opportunity to take introductory visual art classes through the OFA. These extracurricular classes do not count for academic credit and are ungraded. Though the OFA has an extensive selection of ceramics courses, the only other term-time visual arts class offered is a figure-drawing course, which has been taught for 25 years by Boston professional Jon Imber. According to OFA Director of Programs Cathleen D. McCormick, the OFA is intent on providing classes for students who want to try something new as well as for advanced artists.
“Students have definitely expressed an interest in painting and photography,” McCormick says. However, she adds, “we were just about to pursue a couple of new art courses when the fiscal crisis hit, and we had to cut back.” McCormick points to the absence of a studio space with the proper ventilation for oil painting as a typical reason for the lack of a given class. On the positive side, she notes that last month the OFA offered a J-Term watercolor intensive course that helped to fill a niche in the curriculum. According to McCormick, seven of the students in that course had little or no art background, but were attracted by the chance to learn a new medium in the open January period.
Unlike other visual arts, the Ceramics Program at Harvard faces no shortage of classes or studio space. The program has an 11,000 square-foot studio in Allston for permanent use, and this semester alone is offering 10 studio courses, which is the same as the number of VES studio classes available. Unlike most Harvard art programs, ceramics classes are open to all undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff at Harvard, as well as to members of the local community. Shawn L. Panepinto, the Acting Director of the Ceramics program, attributes its continuing strength to the presence of an engaged set of expert, intermediate, and novice potters. Registration fees for the program’s courses also help to cover its costs. Though ceramics classes sometimes fill up quickly, Panepinto says that the program always makes space for undergraduates.
Admission to the OFA’s figure drawing class is not as easy. According to Imber, about 30 students generally wish to take his class, but he can only admit 15. Admission is determined on a first-come, first-served basis. Nonetheless, Imber says that he has generally been able to find space for students who were very enthusiastic but late in signing up.
GOING LOW-KEY
The VES department and the OFA are united in their focus on students willing to sacrifice time and energy for a real understanding of an art. Many prospective artists, however, are not so ambitious. The Freshman Arts Advisory Board (FAAB) is a group of 15 freshmen that caters to this latter demographic. Rory Michelle Sullivan ’09, the Director for Residential Education and Arts Initiatives at the Freshman Dean’s Office, started the group last semester in order to get student feedback in establishing additional arts programming. The biggest message she heard from students who applied to be on the board was that there was a need for more low-intensity arts offerings. “A big priority that all the board decided was directing towards low-risk, low-commitment, low-pressure opportunities to just try and experiment with art,” she says.
This push for low-pressure engagement with art led the group to organize an event entitled “A FAAB Affair,” to take place tomorrow evening in the basement of Memorial Hall. The event is comprised of a series of workshops where students can come and learn crafts ranging from origami to ballroom dancing. According to Sullivan and FAAB member Kobi A. Rex ’14, the group hopes the event will interest people who are not generally involved in the arts and get them to try something new. “We want to have a bigger arts community on campus. We want to give them the ability to go low-key,” says Rex. In addition, FAAB is organizing a series of four- to eight-week workshops in subjects like figure drawing and documentary theater.
It was only last year that Harvard decided to invest the Director for Residential Education with the responsibility of getting freshmen involved in the arts. Though Sullivan is full of praise for the Harvard arts scene, she emphasizes the high demands it places on its participants and the alienation that it can have on those who just want to try something new.
“I do think it’s hard to find somewhere to just paint on a Saturday afternoon,” she says. “You can’t just go and use a Carpenter Center studio unless you’re in a VES class, and you can’t be in a VES class unless you get into a VES class and are willing to spend the time involved in a class commitment and are willing to use a space in your core schedule for arts.”
Lingford, however, disagrees that there is a large demand for low-intensity investment in the arts. “Harvard students are intense about everything,” she says. “When Harvard students are relaxing, they do it very intensely.”
TECHNICAL CONCERNS
Within the administration and faculty, then, lie several points of disagreement over the role of visual art in a liberal arts education at Havrard. These debates manifest themselves in opposing methodologies behind arts teaching itself.
For Imber, a self-proclaimed traditionalist, Harvard classes take the wrong approach to the visual arts. “A more formal education in the visual arts is ... singularly left out of the Harvard experience,” he says.  “I think the perception now of students is that studio practice is not as important. It keeps being marginalized by some sort of elite of the art world.”
VES proponents tend to view arts learning in opposite terms. “We don’t really learn how to write a press release or a lot of very practical things, yet a lot of people who graduate from Harvard are able to do these things very very well, and a similar idea applies to the arts,” says Chun. “If you are interested in learning all the practical, technical stuff, there’s plenty of opportunity to do so through your own initiative.”
Regardless of pedagogy, one thing is clear. At Harvard, if you want to learn about the practice of art, opportunities exist for the motivated and amenable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is probably no rhetorical device more favored by literary critics in the past decade than forecasting the death or rebirth of the contemporary novel. Among the form’s devotees there is often a vague sense of unease, a sense that the novel is under siege and must redefine itself in a world that is willing to render it obsolete. It goes without saying that such predictions are exaggerated: the structure of the novel is omnivorous, digesting any material proffered to it and mutating in unexpected ways with each subsequent generation.
We are fortunate, then, to have a sign of the novel’s health in the recent translation of Mathias Énard’s “Zone,” published in France in 2008 and now available in a potent translation by Charlotte Mandell. Only rarely is a novel ambitious enough to contribute to the general discourse on the novel, as if one book could illuminate them all. Yet, “Zone,” which draws equally from the French- and English-language novelistic traditions, is perhaps capable of telling us something about one possible shape the novel may take going forward. Formally ambitious and with a deep sense of political engagement, “Zone” is brilliant but imperfect, a virtuosic showcase of memory, consciousness, and the lingering effects of political conflict from the Spanish Civil War to the crisis in Palestine.
Hung over and having missed his plane, French spy Francis Servain Mirkovic boards a train from Milan to Rome. At the end of his journey Francis expects to trade away the information accumulated over the years spent in his operational zone in order to receive cash and a new name, and to escape the world of espionage. The reader is placed in the swarm of Francis’ thoughts as he sits in his seat, allowed to experience his unending torrent of observations and memories. Francis’ thoughts flit between disparate topics: one moment he can examine his neighbor’s newspaper and the next he can remember an arcane piece of history, or the years he spent fighting in the Balkans in the 1990s.
Francis has been a neo-Nazi youth, a soldier for the nationalist cause of Croatia, a transient soul, and a spy. He has built and destroyed many relationships in that time, both platonic and romantic, and these half-remembered faces continually resurface in the novel, like ghosts trailing alongside him as he speeds towards his destination. Francis cannot mirror the unstoppable progress of the train, offering a small theory of history and its observers: “a train isn’t circular, it goes from one point to another whereas I am in orbit I gravitate like a chunk of rock.”
Francis’ monologue is expressed with the novel’s most distinctive formal characteristic, its lack of periods. “Zone” barrels forward in what is close to one long, continuous sentence, only interrupted by two sections in which Francis reads a collection of short stories about the Palestinian conflict. The text of the story punctuates the otherwise continuous flow of thought. Thoughts rush by quickly, are interrupted, and return without warning, leaping to a new memory when the last trail grows cold.
At first glance, this technique runs the risk of being a simple trick. There is no doubt that Énard’s style is incapable of keeping up with the breathless energy that defined the novel’s most direct stylistic predecessor, the final section of “Ulysses.” Énard’s run-on sentence is less radical, serving as a way to create more fluid boundaries between the enormous number of topics through which the novel cycles. While the style is not always innovative, it is effective. When unsuccessful, this technique reads like multiple sentences that have been comma-spliced together, but its success is often marked by moments of powerful inertia.
The novel directly references many of its forbearers, such as Joyce himself, Apollinaire, Cervantes, and Durrell. However, Énard’s digressive strategy seems to owe the most to W.G. Sebald, mingling history and personal memory in provocative juxtapositions. As Francis’s mind flits from subject to subject, tragedy to tragedy, the reader begins to infer a complex narrative of personal relationships and political incidents.
However, the blessing of such a digressive organizational strategy can also be its curse. From his position of reflection, Francis is a truly stationary character. He is so passive that the act of remembering is the only agency his character has. Sometimes this long chain of memories feels like it lacks the causal structure that many expect from the conventional novel. Énard seems to intend that Francis remain powerless under the burden of his traumatic memories. Yet the novel occasionally feels as if it lacks a truly compelling reason to continue forward in the present.
Perhaps even more notable than the structure of “Zone” is its willingness to engage with politics. Francis in his current state seems to hold no strong political positions of his own, but instead serves as a lens that focuses the history of the Mediterranean, the zone he has served in as a spy. Francis can only be a witness to ceaseless repetitions of cruelty, a minor historian of “man’s estate.” It is a bold move to position the narrator as a participant in the 20th century’s most violent moments, from the Balkans to Algeria to Palestine. Énard creates a sense of history that is nearly apocalyptic, suggesting that we are doomed to commit the same atrocities that have existed since the Trojan War.
“Zone” is occasionally too diffuse and does not contain the type of realistic characterization that is standard in contemporary fiction. By attempting to synthesize the history of conflict in the 20th century, Énard risks overburdening  himself. And yet, “Zone” makes an important contribution to contemporary literature by unifying its political and formal ambitions. Buoyed by powerful, stark prose and an acute sense of empathy, “Zone” carries the novel forward as unstoppably as the history it seeks to describe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe,” there is a memorable scene that takes place in Alfred Kazin’s luxurious Riverside Drive apartment. In a lovely but reductive caricature of the New York intellectual circuit, Maf, Monroe’s white Maltese—a self-professed Trotskyite—watches the men of the Partisan Review take each other’s ideas to task as their forgotten wives cower in the corner. Meanwhile, a young “girl of eager solemnity” named Susan (Sontag, perhaps?) expounds on the “cascade of pensées” she intends to write.
Monroe, soaked in Chanel No. 5, has withdrawn to Kazin’s bedroom to discuss psychiatrist Sigmund Freud’s essay “Dostoevsky and Parricide” with Irving Howe and Lionel and Diana Trilling. The elegant intellectuals and the sumptuous actress engage in a somewhat reflexive conversation that outlines what seems to be the novel’s project.
Praising Dostoevsky’s refusal to spare anyone in his novels, the character of Irving Howe suggests that the present dearth of comic novels results from an inability of the modern novelist to conceive of ‘the pícaro,’ a character who, just like Maf, is “defined by his energy and his voice,” moving “from adventure to adventure, each cluster of incidents bringing him into a relation with a new set of characters.” All great stories, Howe continues, are about the servants: “King Lear” is really about the fool, and “The Brothers Karamazov” is really about Smerdyakov.
In this little ‘play within a play,’ O’Hagan presents his latest book as an attempt to fill that void, to write such a comic novel in an age that seems to have abandoned the genre altogether. Like the picaresque comedies of Cervantes and Henry Fielding, O’Hagan’s story even has its own ‘pícaro,’ in the character of Maf, a typical roguish outsider who enters either a corrupt or bizarre society only to skewer it with his cunning and humorous observations. And in the case that none of that becomes apparent in the text itself, O’Hagan goes so far as to title his meditation “The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe,” a clear allusion to Laurence Sterne’s “The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.”
The problem with “The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog,” however, is not its aggressive self-presentation as such a comic novel; at times, O’Hagan’s narrative is indeed a clever outsider’s portrayal of the ultimate insider’s world. The problem, rather, is that O’Hagan’s obsession with his chosen genre seems to inhibit any substantive portrait of Marilyn Monroe whatsoever. There is no reason that the psychology of a cultural icon of Monroe’s stature need be ignored for what O’Hagan seems to believe constitute the conventions of the comic novel: the two are not mutually exclusive, and the novel suffers from its highly superficial and unexamined portrait of Monroe herself.  Often, it even seems as though she exists merely to grant Maf access to some of the sorts of social circles he can criticize, admire, or attack. And there are many.
In a remarkable feat of name-dropping, O’Hagan starts with the vestiges of the Bloomsbury Group on the estate of Vanessa Bell, where Natalie Wood and her mother discover Maf. He then continues on to Los Angeles, where Wood’s mother sells him to Frank Sinatra, who then flies the dog across the country to deliver to the recently divorced Monroe, newly ensconced in her Sutton Place apartment. From then on, in addition to Kazin, Howe, and the Trillings, we meet Allen Ginsberg, Carson McCullers, Peter Lawford, and, of course, President John F. Kennedy ‘40. All that happened between Monroe and the President, according to Maf, was an intense conversation. “Don’t hold your breath for stunning revelations,” he cautions.
The result, of course, is that Monroe herself cannot be considered anything more than a plot device that enables her dog to witness some of the 20th century’s most interesting conversations. Perhaps the novel would be more substantive if Maf explored the psychology or the ideas of the famous faces he encounters rather than being distracted by their celebrity. This, in a sense, is the novel’s great weakness; for comic effect, O’Hagan’s novel celebrates the aura of Marilyn’s celebrity without addressing the necessary questions that such a celebrity inspires.
It hardly needs to be said that Monroe was a fascinating character. Christened Norma Jeane Mortensen, she transformed herself into an object of male desire, became a cultural artifact with celebrity that came to inhabit her entire identity, and fell into a depression that ultimately ended with her suicide in 1962. As any reader of Joyce Carol Oates’s “Blonde” can attest, much can be done with such a complex figure. But in O’Hagan’s novel, where is Monroe’s transformation? Where is the effect of her celebrity on her psychology? Where is her descent into mental illness?
Of course, it could be argued that this novel is not exactly about Marilyn Monroe in an explicit sense and is instead a portrait of her cultural milieu. However, regardless of O’Hagan’s focus, it seems irresponsible to ignore Monroe’s interiority, given his plot’s reliance on her life and her social circles.
Of course, O’Hagan is quick to include the cliché of Monroe as a good girl victimized by the drooling glances of men; according to Maf, “it was as if the world had bleached her with attention.” His mistress, he continues, “wanted to learn to be taken seriously, to value her experience. And yet she was hitched to the person she had always been: the girl who was sweet and available, who now took pills and drank.”
These meditations aside, there is little in the novel that addresses the depth of Monroe’s character, or the toll her celebrity took on her person. Of her psychological disarray, Maf only confesses in passing he “can’t pretend that I ever truly understand what ailed my owner; it was the human thing, that burden of self-consciousness that weighs down the day.” Because O’Hagan’s novel cannot avoid addressing Monroe’s death, “the human thing” is just not enough to explain her depression or her mysterious end. Once she checks into a psychiatric clinic, any interpretation is passed over for yet another moment of mental masturbation. Maf ruminates on Virginia Woolf and her dislike for James Joyce, saying only of Monroe that she lay distraught, “dreaming of her father.”
Even if “The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog” does not quite fulfill its potential, its caricatures have their occasional entertaining moments. But the comic novel needn’t be caricature alone, and O’Hagan’s failure to overcome such superficiality leaves the reader wondering not what his novel achieves but rather what it might have been.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On September 18, 1983, the Andalusian painter José Pérez Ocaña slipped on a wig and a sun costume he had made for himself of paper, cloth, and flares, closed the door of his flat in Barcelona, and walked down the stairs to join his friends. Ocaña had sensitive features and big dark eyes, which he sometimes liked to line in kohl; he had dressed in flamboyant outfits like this one many times before. This time, however, the flares somehow made contact with the paper, and the costume caught fire. The burns were fatal; Ocaña died in hospital one week later.
Ocaña is alluded to briefly in “Barcelona, 1975,” one of nine stories in Colm Tóibín’s new collection “The Empty Family,” as the unnamed subject of a Ventura Pons film playing in the Cine Malda. His outwardly expressive presence becomes an invisible counterpoint to all of Tóibín’s more passive protagonists—individuals who, unlike Ocaña, are either unable or uniwlling to display themselves so openly and wish for lives that are totally private. Because society transforms their desires into transgressions, however, a cozy private life is impossible, and so they retreat into their own inner worlds.
An Irish writer best known for his novels “The Blackwater Lightship,” “The Master,” and “Brooklyn,” Tóibín knows how to turn a lovely sentence, full of cadence and lyricism. In this collection, Ireland makes up the backdrop: many of his characters are returning to Ireland after a long absence, or are still—though expatriates—carrying the land within them. Occasionally, his impressionistic parlor language becomes delicate to the point of self-indulgence, as in the title story or the multiple stories about dying older relatives. For the most part, though, these are truly radiant selections, exercises in the pleasures of slowness.
Tóibín openly draws inspiration from the dense, introspective works of the late Henry James. Various characters read James’ novels, and in the opener “Silence,” one Lady Gregory, of whom James makes passing note in his diaries, recounts her adulterous affair. Like James, Tóibín carefully puts each word in its place; his elegiac sentences can barely contain his characters’ mad desires. But the analogy ends with style, not any larger literary architecture. James, in his preface to “The Wings of the Dove,” lays out his ideal for the novel: blocks of plot with various ‘centres’ finely drawn, along with structural clues—’secrets and compartments, with possible treacheries and traps’—planted along the way so the parts might fit seamlessly together. Tóibín’s plots do not aim for this careful self-contained craftsmanship, just as his characters lack any self-conscious craftsmanship of their own lives.
Instead of interlocking narratives, Tóibín tells the same story again and again, in different environments and with different characters: an intense private life, with the outside world beyond knowledge or control. At times, characters are responsible for fencing themselves off: ‘the rest is science and I do not do science.’ Politics are largely a matter of indifference: a young woman’s leftist leanings as a university student in England are meaningful largely due to the estrangement she feels from her Spanish family when she returns home. In the years following the fall of General Francisco Franco, who dictated Spain from 1936 to 1975, Tóibín’s characters are not building a new government but staging private orgies. As a student writes: ‘Now and then over those months, a crucial time in the history of Spain, I noticed how generally indifferent people were to anything except the private realm, which was inhabited by the young with great intensity. The books you read, the friends you met, the lovers you slept with, the music you listened to, the new identities you took on, these were the things that mattered in that autumn in Barcelona.’
One illicit private passion that Tóibín addresses in the novel is gay sex. There is the passage of despairing, frantic tenderness between two schoolboys in “The Pearl Fishers,” one of many bleak, erotically charged scenes: “I wondered if he would avoid me… if he would try to make me forget that I had fed his sweet, thick, pungent, lemony sperm into my mouth with my fingers as if it were jam, desperately trying to make sure that none was wasted.” In the lovely final story, “The Street,” Tóibín picks up the familiar narrative of Pakistani immigrants finding their identity but adds a twist—this is not London but Barcelona, and his characters are gay. Abdul and Malik fall in love while working together selling mobile phones; when their boss catches them in a closet at the shop, he beats them. The real struggle comes in the weeks following, when the two must learn how to live with one another.
Although in these stories private urges are often overwhelming, when one party loses interest or desire, the other is always willing to let him drift away. Tóibín’s narrators are unflinching in their accounts of love lost. Lives collide and come apart with ease and without reason; endless possibility exists only because it is so absolutely untrimmed by expectation. ‘I walked down the stairs of that flat in the Plaza Real for the last time and into the shining city,’ a character writes. ‘I was ready, once more, for anything.’ Crossing a Dublin bridge in what is perhaps the most lovely passage in the book, the narrator reflects that: ‘no matter how grim the city I walked through was, how cavernous my attic rooms, how long and solitary the night to come, I would not exchange any of it for the easy rituals of mutuality and closeness that Grainne and Donnacha were performing now. I checked my pocket to make sure I had the keys with me and almost smiled to myself at the bare thought that I had not forgotten them.’
Perhaps this Irish grimness is why Spain, where Tóibín moved following university, takes on a quasi-mythical status in his writing. To Tóibín, Spain is Ireland’s inverse, a conflagration of intense living, in which the public and the private merge in drug-hazed carnivals and fascism, art and free love. The Ireland of his books is quiet, Catholic, gray; it mourns. And yet Tóibín treats it tenderly, for it is the place where the ordinary happens. People work, write, and die slow, natural deaths. ‘Life, that was the material that he used and needed. There could never be enough life,’ he writes. ‘But it was only the beginning, of course, because life was thin.’ Living out fragments of stories with no narrative or nostalgia, Tóibín’s characters possess nothing more than “bare thoughts.” It is only after the fact, sitting alone in their rooms remembering, that these thoughts assume the mantle of truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 1 p.m. on Tuesday again. Dragging your feet to your section at CGIS, you can’t help but wonder why you must attend another class discussion that will be far from rewarding.
Unfortunately, section discussion at Harvard is often disorganized and unfocused. Material covered in section often fails to relate to lectures. Many times students conspicuously jockey for participation points, feeling painfully obliged to do so. Students in section hardly know one another, smiling at each other but often hesitating to freely opine on touchy topics such as affirmative action, legalizing gay marriage, or drug testing on animals.
Many of us have experienced similar “bad section blues.” While I’ve certainly had some rewarding sections and wonderful teaching fellows, I feel that, across the board, class sections could significantly improve, easing student frustration and providing more gratifying discussions.
In order to accomplish this, professors and TFs need first to explain clearly the goals and expectations of their sections. They should aim to clarify what students should try to take away from every section, how the material relates to the course’s overall goals, and how participation will be assessed and facilitated. This kind of clear and regular dialogue between faculty, TFs, and students can only improve the experience for everyone involved.
The second way to improve sections would be for TFs to facilitate student interaction better and students’ feeling comfortable sharing their ideas with one another. Often unfamiliar with the others in their sections, many students are less likely to be excited about openly discussing their opinions—no one wants to appear hostile by challenging strangers under contrived circumstances.
In freshman pre-orientation programs such as the First-Year Urban Program, many students’ most memorable experiences are the nightly group discussions. Students who have just recently met sit down to talk openly about thorny issues like identity, gender roles, class, and race. In my FUP group, for example, our discussion leaders’ effort to make us feel comfortable with one another eventually paid off, as we were soon unabashed about sharing of our different socioeconomic and familial backgrounds. With a little guidance, we made a clear commitment to listen and to try to understand one another, despite having just met. If TFs and students similarly make this a priority, it shouldn’t be difficult to replicate this type of open and conducive discussion environment during class sections.
Finally, in order to make sections more engaging for students, TFs need to be more open about sharing their intellectual enthusiasm with students. By nature, TFs at Harvard are accomplished thinkers and learners in their fields. They clearly have interest and passion for the subjects they teach, or they would never have decided to pursue advanced degrees in those fields. TFs need to share that love and excitement with their students, particularly in classes where the subject matter is new to most. Passion is always contagious. The more TFs explain why they are excited about their fields and the classes they teach, the more likely students will be receptive to engaging in and learning from these classes.
Over the last three semesters, learning at Harvard for me has been an incredible educational experience, but one that can definitely improve. Sections should be the first place to start.

For the final day of a course I took in Jerusalem last semester on negotiating Middle East peace, the professor organized a simulation peace summit. Three other Jewish and staunchly Zionist classmates and I signed up to play the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Before the meeting, the professor remarked that the assignment we were about to undertake would be “an exercise in empathy” for us, a unique experience that would have a remarkable and profound effect on the way we view Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. He was right. By the end of that simulation, I had not only jettisoned most of my assumptions about negotiating Middle East peace but also gained a deep understanding as to why many Israeli and Palestinian advocacy groups just can’t seem to talk to each other.
To understand the Palestinian mindset when it came to negotiations, I had to drastically alter my Israeli one. Israelis tend to view the conflict in terms of pragmatism and security. This is why pro-Israel advocacy groups often have names like “Americans for a Safe Israel” or “Emergency Committee for Israel.” The overall mantra of these groups is that the Israeli and American governments should only endorse an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement if it produces a secure Palestinian state alongside a secure Jewish state. That is, Israeli territorial concessions are predicated on the ability of Palestinian leadership to produce stability and to stifle terrorism—something that most assuredly did not happen when Israel disengaged from Gaza in 2005.
On the other hand, Palestinians view negotiations—and, indeed, the conflict as a whole—through the lens of legality and human rights. This is why pro-Palestinian groups often use names like “Students for Justice in Palestine,” or “Americans United for Palestinian Human Rights.” From the perspective of these groups, the goal of negotiations is to compel Israel to fulfill duties that have already been acknowledged as required under what most of the world considers international law. United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, for example, affirm the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,” thereby making any territory garnered by Israel as a result the 1967 Six-Day War entirely illegitimate. As the PLO Negotiation Affairs Department starkly asserts, “the comprehensive settlement to the conflict is embodied in United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338…the purpose of the negotiations is to implement these UN resolutions.”
These two perspectives framed our simulation summit. And as the talks wore on, it soon dawned on both the PLO and Israeli delegations that our peace summit was headed for disaster. At one point, for example, the Israeli side offered us East Jerusalem, a territory it garnered during the war of 1967, in exchange for our dropping the demand for the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees dispossessed during the war of 1948. A few months ago, I would have probably considered this a generous offer. Most Middle East analysts today (and even, as revealed last week by Al Jazeera, the current head of the Palestinian Authority) consider the absolute right of return for Palestinian refugees infeasible. And allowing all neighborhoods in East Jerusalem—including the Jewish ones—to come under Palestinian sovereignty is something that has never been offered before by any prime minister in Israel’s history.
But viewing this offer through the Palestinian lens led me to a very different conclusion. The Israelis, I reasoned, were merely offering to fulfill one of their obligations already required under international law, but only as long as we dropped one of our own demands enshrined in international law, in United Nations Resolution 194. When I alerted the Israeli negotiator to this UN Resolution, he commented that that this document could not possibly still be considered relevant because it is over sixty years old. I reminded him that the Declaration of the State of Israel is also over sixty years old, and I summarily rejected his offer on behalf of my team.
Needless to say, our summit achieved exactly nothing. The Israeli and Palestinian sides framed their demands in two different languages and kept getting frustrated by the other side’s inability to understand them. Indeed, these two mindsets seem to frame the public debate about Israel-Palestine as a whole. Consider, for example, the rhetoric in the aftermath of Israel’s deadly botched flotilla raid in May 2010. The American Jewish Committee, for example, dubbed the Mavi Marmara the “Terror Flotilla” on the basis that the siege that the boat was attempting to break was imposed to weaken Hamas’s hold over Gaza. But pro-Palestinian groups consistently portrayed the activists as civil-rights martyrs and focused more on the injustice of the blockade for the people of Gaza rather than those who ruled over them. As a Turkish film producer who recently created a fictionalized film about the incident told The New York Times, “all we want is freedom for innocent and tormented Palestinian people.”
Even after this summit, I still believe that a resolution to the conflict lies more in a “solutions-based” rather than a “rights-based” approach. But part of resolving this strife is making sure that both sides understand the rhetoric and mindset of the other. The challenge is to find a middle ground between these two mindsets—that is, an overlapping boundary between “security for Israel” and “justice for Palestine.” I may not know where this boundary lies, but at least my experience in the other side’s shoes provided me with a better understanding of how to find it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s economics department hosts the largest number of undergraduates on campus, so when this mammoth concentration shifts position, everyone takes note. Thus, the recent changes to concentration procedures and requirements deserve special attention. This past month, the department revised its course requirements for incoming freshmen, increasing the number of required classes from 10 to 11 for non-honors concentrators and up to 15 for honors concentrators. Additionally, it added Math 1a as a basic math requirement (honors candidates must now take at least 21a). After cutting junior seminars in 2009, the department now has seven seminars in place this semester, serving 18 students each. And, finally, in an attempt to dispel the sense that it was “too impersonal,” Harvard’s undergraduate economics program brought on concentration advisors.
Impersonal interaction is hard to avoid in economics, which is the largest concentration and does not have a proportionally large faculty base. The college awarded 249 economics degrees in 2009, according to the Harvard University Fact Book. (For comparison, government, the next-largest concentration, awarded 177 degrees.) It is often said that these high student-faculty ratios are the source of the concentration’s low satisfaction scores: The 2010 senior survey, compiled by the Office of Research and Analysis in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, reported that economics received a 3.72/5 satisfaction score, the lowest of the five major concentrations. Indeed, Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, the course head of Economics 10: Principles of Economics, put forth this opinion, blogging last year, “If the student-faculty ratio is the ultimate problem leading to low satisfaction with the econ major, and I believe that it is, there are two ways to improve the situation: Increase the number of economics faculty or decrease the number of economics students.”
However, complicating the pinning of low satisfaction ratings on the student-faculty ratio is the fact that this year’s junior seminars—although recently reinstated—are not popular among concentrators. In fact, there were only 34 applicants for 68 junior seminar spots this past shopping period. The question remains: Why did so few out of approximately 250 concentrators want an intensive academic experience in their discipline?
Even taking into account the idea that some took one of the three fall junior seminars, the number of interested students is still small. After all, in many other concentrations, such as in Social Studies, students habitually take a junior seminar each term. If economics is truly a concentration full of students eager to be satisfied by their choice of academic discipline but unable to get enough personal faculty attention, why do these students seem to make such a weak effort at getting academic attention when they have the chance?
As to what Harvard can do in the meantime to ease the situation, it should continue adding more difficult quantitative requirements to economics, in keeping with those of peer institutions. Stanford, for instance, requires a five-credit accelerated calculus course in its own economics program. This would distinguish the students who truly care about economics as an academic discipline, and allow them to get personalized faculty attention. It would also be a gift in disguise to less dedicated economics concentrators, who may be forced to discover what truly interests them academically.
The surge in economics concentrators and lack of student enthusiasm for small class settings suggests that Harvard's admissions office should reconsider whether it's really admitting students with genuine intellectual interests rather than just with pre-professional ambitions. The economics department continually reinforces that fact that it is not a pre-professional concentration. The Econ Concentrator’s Guide, which is provided by the department,  reads, “Economics is not business…Economics and business are related, but business is professional training ultimately aimed at making profits, while economics is a science that pursues an improved understanding of our social world.”  However, it seems that many students do not understand this and treat this concentration as a de facto pre-finance or pre-business major. Of course, every economics concentrator can’t be called “pre-professional,” but the parallel growth of the economics concentration and career  recruiting at Harvard over the last several years would suggest that pre-professionalism is nevertheless a problem worthy of addressing in the economics department.
Therefore, although the surge in economics concentrators could very well have something to do with the relevance of economics to the current political arena, the admissions office still must do what it can to make sure that pre-professionalism doesn't become too ingrained on the Harvard psyche. Harvard College is a liberal-arts institution, and it differs from peer institutions in that it emphasizes that, in the academic arena, at least, students should leave with broad-based critical thinking skills rather than a narrow practical specialty. The admissions office, in choosing future classes, would do well keep this focus and these students in mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say when you graduate, "The world is your oyster." This is true: it's sort of an acquired taste, smells odd, and has limited living space available in your price range.
At Harvard, people like to impart the idea that you are a mover and shaker. "Go out there and move things and shake things," they suggest. "That's what Mark Zuckerberg did, and look at him."
So you do your best. You get a job. If you don't get a job, you get an internship -- which is like a job, but with overtones of Ugly Betty -- or you go to graduate school, or you move back into your parents' home and sit around making strange clicking noises while watching The Social Network on loop. "This is what Mark Zuckerberg did," you say, "and now look at him."
But things are different now.
Someone moved the stakes higher. At college, if you awoke with the kind of headache usually reserved for Greek gods who were using their crania to give birth to other Greek gods, you did not really have to get up and go anywhere. In life, you do. The worst thing that happens to you at college if you fail to get out of bed in time is that you will miss two hours of someone reading scintillating anecdotes about Medieval Ireland. The worst thing that happens to you in life if you fail to get out of bed in time is that you might lose your job as a first responder.
You find yourself yelling at college students to keep it down. "Stop carousing!" you yell, shaking a broom at them. "I have work to do!" This is true. At Harvard, you could pretend that you had gotten through an entire book by close reading one passage and saying it reminded you of Nietzche. This no longer flies. "What do you think of the START treaty, Alexandra?" your co-workers ask. You stare at them blankly. "It reminds me of Nietzche," you mutter, finally. "That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard," they say. You have never gotten this response before, and you have no idea what to do, so you go hide in the bathroom for eight hours until everyone leaves the office.
The last invisible barrier separating you from the Actual Adults has fallen. Suddenly, you are expected to interact socially with people in their forties and sixties. "Thanks, sir," you say. "Call me Neil," they tell you. "Sure, Sir Neil," you answer. You are doing your best, but it's all moving too fast.
Your friends are no longer at your beck and call. You can call them, but they won't answer. "They think they're too good for me because they live on the West Coast," you grumble to yourself, forgetting that, in Pacific time, it is four o'clock in the morning. Of course, you have friends all over the world now! This is exciting, except that it makes it difficult to go to the Kong with these friends at 2 a.m.
But it's more than that. You are no longer bound in lockstep with your peers. At college, everyone's milestones occurred in shared clumps. Everyone studied, caroused, won, lost -- simultaneously. Life is not like that.  "Life," they say, "has no final exam." Well, life doesn't even have a final creative group project that is sort of a waste of your semester! And milestones occur at different places in different paths. Someone is getting married. Someone else is getting cast. Someone else is going to law school. You have to choose to share these things -- and not just on Facebook.
After you graduate, they encourage you to network. You show up at something called an Alumni Networking Evening and find yourself cornered by an old man who sweats heavily and claims that he "might have gone to the B-school, but the Sixties were sort of a blur." He gets the idea that you are involved in The Biz and can have his play produced on Broadway, and he won't stop calling your home late at night. "Harvard opens doors," he hisses into the phone. You decide never to network again.
On good days, it's fantastic. "This is life!" you mutter to yourself.  On bad days, it's awful. "Is this life?" you ask, as a taxi ruins your shoes, but not in a fun, Carrie Bradshaw way. "I bet there are kids alive right now who don't even know who Carrie Bradshaw is," you think, wilting. "I'm losing my youth! I'm losing my youth!"
Deep down, you know you have to begin to let go.
But not just yet!

Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan have signed a memorandum of understanding as the first step in a process that would merge the two health care providers, a move that would consolidate the respectively second and third largest insurers in the state of Massachusetts.
The two nonprofit health insurance providers stated in a joint press release last week that a final merger decision is anticipated in the next several months.
The memorandum of understanding, signed by both providers last week, serves as a prerequisite to discussions between the two as to the particulars—and feasibility—of the merger itself. Among other things, the providers stated in the press release that the two companies will use this time period to explore possible benefits of a merger to consumers.
Harvard Pilgrim spokesperson Sharon Torgerson said that the two companies hope to remove administrative duplication and “get value to the clients” through the merger.
If a merger agreement is reached, a regulatory review process will begin in all states in which the two plans operate. While a majority of the two companies’ clients reside in Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim also operates in Maine and New Hampshire, while Tufts also operates in Rhode Island.
In Massachusetts, the merger will be reviewed by both the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation and the state Attorney General’s office.
“The Division of Insurance will give a merger a very close look after a proposal is received. There will be a thorough review of the criteria as outlined in state law,” Jason Lefferts, the director of communications for the office of consumer affairs, wrote in an e-mailed statement.
“It’s going to be a complex approval process because there are so many regulators involved,” said Harvard School of Public Health Professor and former state insurance regulator Nancy C. Turnbull.
She added that despite the obstacles facing a merger on this scale, she expects the deal to pass regulatory review.
The proposed merger has the potential to shift the competitive nature of the state’s health insurance market.
“Massachusetts is really unusual among states,” Turnbull said. “It’s dominated by three locally-based, nonprofit heath care providers. Large for-profits have very little market share.” Turnbull added that she hoped the merger would help preserve Massachusetts’ landscape of not-for-profit health care providers.
Currently, the largest health care provider in Massachusetts is Blue Cross Blue Shield, with about three million members. Harvard Pilgrim has about one million members in state, and Tufts has about 750,000. The combined Harvard Pilgrim/Tufts plan would be on a scale more on par with Blue Cross, and thus would be able to compete more effectively in the marketplace. All three firms are not-for-profit.
“People may think they’re preparing to be merged to be larger and compete with Blue Cross,” Turnbull said. “Doing this will give them more market power.”
Out-of-state employers have been growing in numbers in recent years in Massachusetts, which has also led to an increased use of out-of-state health care providers. The merger between the Harvard and Tufts plan may help to increase the companies’ “presence,” Turnbull said.
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care was rated the number one private health plan in the nation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance in 2010, and Tufts Health Plan was rated second.
Harvard Pilgrim maintains the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute at Harvard Medical School.

Though the protesters in Egypt shot at by riot police with rubber bullets were halfway across the globe, they were not faceless to History of Science Lecturer Ahmed Ragab. His  brother-in-law not only participated in the first demonstration of the ongoing uprising, but was also among the protestors injured by the Egyptian riot police.
When hundreds of protesters gathered on Saturday afternoon in Harvard Square, Ragab joined them to show support for the Egyptian demonstrators.
“The Egyptian people are finally coming out to demand their rights for freedom and democracy,” Ragab said. “Everyone who supports freedom and democracy should stand with them and support their struggle.”
Ragab also signed an open letter to President Obama last week calling for a stronger stance against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s regime.
“The administration is still concerned with what they can gain from the Mubarak regime and what the Mubarak regime can offer them, but the people will not, cannot settle for anything but the absolute end of the regime,” he said. “Anything less than this, any discussion of political reform is too little, too late.”
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Professor Malika Zeghal said the protesters want a “radical change” in Egypt’s governance.
“They won’t accept any superficial reforms, such as just changing certain people in the government,” Zeghal said. “They believe that it’s time for the regime to change, for Mubarak to step down.”
The US government has signaled support for the protesters, but has not joined them in pushing for Mubarak’s resignation. Some sympathize with the Obama administration’s difficult political situation.
“[The US wants] a managed transition to democracy, which is not enough for Egyptians in the streets,” Zeghal said. “Egypt is one of the United States’ strongest allies in the region, so it’s a very fine line to walk.”
Ahmed S. Belal ’12, who grew up outside Alexandria, referred to the US’s current stance as a “smart move” from a diplomatic standpoint.
“It is disappointing, however, considering the US is supposed to be a beacon of democracy, and it’s pushing for a puppet democracy instead of a true democracy,” he said.
Even if the US will not offer full support to the protesters, Belal said he does not think the Egyptian government will be able to maintain the status quo.
“Even if Mubarak isn’t ousted, there will be huge changes in Egypt,” he said.
The demonstrations may result in more than reforms in Egypt. Some pundits predict it will be a catalyst for change in other Middle Eastern countries.
“There is a feeling of hope that is spreading throughout the region,” Ragab said. “People are interested in creating something new, in creating a new future for themselves.”
While the situation in Egypt has continued to escalate, Vice Provost of International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez, who is in charge of Harvard students abroad, said yesterday that out of three University students who were in the country when the protests began, two graduate students have been safely evacuated out of Egypt, while the third, a doctoral student, has chosen to stay to continue his research.

In an effort to reevaluate academic integrity policy, the Office of Undergraduate Education will open up an Academic Integrity Assessment on February 7, the College announced yesterday in an e-mail to the undergraduate student body.
The assessment will consist of three different surveys—one intended for students, one for teaching fellows, and one for faculty—which will anonymously gauge the prevalence of academic dishonesty among students.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, the assessment is an attempt to open up a conversation about issues of plagiarism and cheating.
“This survey is not motivated by the assumption that students are cheating,” Harris said. “We’re more interested in how they’re thinking about [issues of academic integrity].”
The Academic Integrity Assessment will be launched in coordination with the Center for Academic Integrity at Clemson University, which will process student and instructor responses and return a report to the College in mid-to-late spring.
Understanding student perception of academic integrity is crucial to reducing plagiarism and cheating, according to Teresa Fishman, the center’s director.
“We want to develop in students the sense that a degree has higher value when the reputation of the institution is intact,” said Fishman. “This is all about changing the culture.”
According to data collected by the Center for Academic Integrity, the majority of college professors report having witnessed academic dishonesty in their classes. Eighty-six percent of faculty at universities that have been studied by the organization report to having observed “serious written cheating,” while seventy percent of these professors report that they have seen “serious test / exam cheating.”
Nationwide rates of students admitting to cheating are much lower, according to the data. Only 48 percent of students reported that they had engaged in “serious written cheating,” and a mere 22 percent of students admit to having engaged in “serious test / exam cheating.”
According to Fishman, most academic institutions have similar rates of cheating.
“Almost all schools end up with higher rates than they expect,” she said.
However, Harris added that the technological age has given students greater resources with which to cheat, but has also made professors more wary of plagiarism and cheating.
“There’s a sense among faculty members that because of [the Internet], students may be cutting corners more than they used to,” said Harris. “The question is whether the cases that come to the Ad board are the tip of the iceberg, or the iceberg itself.”
The College, which does not presently have an honor code, may use the survey to evaluate whether such a policy is needed.
“There’s strong evidence that really well-crafted honor codes work well,” said Harris. “But many codes fail to achieve their goals.”
Rather, Harris said he thinks that academic integrity goes beyond an official honor code.
“In the end, what everyone’s looking to accomplish at any university is really to instill a culture of integrity in its students,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a national debate simmers over a new, sanitized version of the American classic “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” members of the Harvard community say they are skeptical of the new edition of the novel.
The book—scheduled to be released in February by NewSouth Books—will replace all instances of the word “nigger” with “slave.” Alan Gribben, a professor of English at Auburn University, said in an article in The New York Times that he initiated the project as a means to make the modified text more accessible to younger readers and general audiences.
Several members of the Harvard community say they acknowledge the malevolence of the word in American culture and society, but question whether its removal from the text will be significant enough to warrant the revision of a classic piece of literature.
“I understand what they’re trying to do, make it more accessible, but they’re paying a tremendous price to essentially acquiesce to those who object to ‘Adventures of Huckleberry Finn’ because it contains this word,” says Harvard Law School Professor Randall L. Kennedy, the author of “Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.”
TROUBLING BUT HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT
A variation of the word emerged as early as 1619 in the journals of English settler John Rolfe. The term had become a potent epithet by the time that Mark Twain penned “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” in the late nineteenth century.
Professor of English and of African and African American Studies Glenda R. Carpio says she acknowledges the sinister nature of the word in history, but that she does not understand why the text is being changed at this particular point in time.
“It is such a heavy word in American culture, but it is not a word that Twain uses off-handedly,” Carpio says. “Twain was using it in a time when it wasn’t as taboo as it is now and it was a term characteristic of the historical context in which the novel was written.”
Cedrick J. Yancey ’12, vice-president of the Black Men’s Forum, agrees that the term represents the historical context of the novel, rather than current negative associations with the term.
“It is a reflection of the times and should be left in,” he says. “I don’t understand the motivation [to remove the term] after all of these years.”
Professor of English Louis Menand says that he respects the negative views that others have towards the word because, as a white man, he says he believes he has never had to directly confront the negativity associated with the term.
“It’s a word that does not affect white people like it affects African Americans,” Menand says.
But Menand says he believes that maintaining the textual integrity of the novel was his responsibility as a professor.
“We teach the text as it’s written as part of our job, for good or ill,” he says. “It doesn’t help us to try to use a text that’s not the text that the author wrote, whether we approve of it or not.”
Carpio also expresses concern that the new edition of Twain’s work could open a Pandora’s box of future revisions, given that the term “nigger” is used in many classic works of literature.
“It’s an interesting wish to erase this word, as if erasing it would erase its malevolent use in American culture,” she says. “I don’t think that omitting the word is going to get us there.”
A WELL-WORN PATH
Gribben’s endeavors do not mark the first rallying cries for the modification of classic texts.
In 2009, for instance, high school teacher John Foley publicly advocated for the removal of several well-known novels from high school reading lists in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He directly cited the use of racial slurs in “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” as well as other well-known novels, including “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “Of Mice and Men.”
“Some might call this apostasy; I call it common sense,” Foley wrote at the time. “Obama’s victory signals that Americans are ready for a change. Let’s follow his lead and make a change that removes the N-word from the high school curriculum.”
Kennedy, the HLS professor, says that he profoundly disagrees with the new edition of “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” spearheaded by Gribben.
Modifying texts is not a valuable remedy to the racial dilemmas that our society must continue to confront, he says.
“Of course it can be a terribly insulting term that is used to ostracize and terrorize people, but it is also true that it’s used in other ways as well,” Kennedy says.
“It seems to me that this word is a part of American culture and we need to understand it. We can’t understand it by papering over it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reverend Peter J. Gomes’ absence from Memorial Church feels oddly incongruous, as though a row of pews or the central altar were missing—after 40 years of service to Harvard University, he is an integral leader and loved presence here—but his colleagues and congregation are committed to ensuring that daily routines proceed as usual.
Gomes was hospitalized in early December after suffering from a stroke, but he has encouraged the Church to continue as normal without him, according to Christian M. Lane, assistant University organist and choirmaster.
“The church continues to thrive,” said Lane. “I think what he wants us to do—and what we are striving to do—is continue on with business as usual. He sets a tone for the church, but the church is not dependent on him solely.”
According to Associate Minister Wendel W. Meyer, Memorial Church has flourished under Gomes’ leadership and colleagues are determined to “keep the wheel going.”
“There’s not much going on that’s different,” said Meyer. “We have an absolutely wonderful and crackerjack staff.”
Gomes is tentatively scheduled to return to Memorial Church to preach at Easter. In the meantime, he has helped compile a list of visiting preachers for the spring.
“History of Harvard and Its Presidents,” the class Gomes was planning to co-teach at the Harvard Divinity School with Stephen P. Shoemaker, has seen an almost 50 percent cut in enrollment this spring.
Shoemaker attributed this to the absence of the “Gomes panache,” as well as a general assumption that the class would be canceled.
Although Shoemaker plans to continue teaching the course much as he has in the past, he acknowledged that Gomes has an intangible quality that attracts students and is largely informed by his intimate knowledge of Harvard’s past.
“Large shoes to fill with small feet is the idea here,” said Shoemaker. “It’s always been interesting to me that when Professor Gomes departs, it usually takes five or six people to fill his spot. In a way, he’s one of the last 19th-century characters left on campus. He’s one of the few around that brings to life that flair, that sense of character. He gets away with things that nobody can get away with.”
His dynamic presence is on the minds of his colleagues at Memorial Church as well.
“What can you say about a personality the size and scope of Peter Gomes’? In some ways, he is an icon for Harvard,” Meyer said, adding that the minister has been not only a nationally respected figure, but also a source of support for Harvard alumni and undergraduates.
“To greet Professor Gomes at the door at Sunday service, at the end of the service, is a really great moment,” said Lane. “He can establish that connection with people. I think we all look forward to having that back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council expressed uneasiness about collaborating with the City of Boston on future development efforts last night after Vertex, a Cambridge-based pharmaceutical company, announced that it will move its headquarters to Boston’s Fan Pier waterfront in 2013.
Councilors estimate that the city will lose approximately 1,600 jobs in addition to commercial tax revenue from the office space being vacated.
City Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 referred to the City of Boston as “the major poacher of them all.”
Reeves criticized collaborating with Boston on future economic ventures, concerned that a regional partnership might not be mutually beneficial to both cities.
City Councilor and State Representative Timothy J. Toomey Jr. echoed Reeves’ comments.
“Whatever they [Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Boston City Council President Michael P. Ross] are going to do to take the business out of here, in Cambridge, they are going to do,” said Toomey. “I don’t want to be held hostage by the City of Boston.” Councilor Leland Cheung—who organized a joint meeting with the City of Boston last December to address retaining tech jobs in the area—took issue with other councilors’ suggestions that efforts to collaborate resulted in the move. Cheung mentioned that $60 million dollars in state funding caused Vertex to relocate and called for increased economic partnerships on a regional level.
“We can’t just stick our heads in the sand and pretend they [Boston] don’t exist,” said Cheung, adding that the creation of jobs in Boston will benefit unemployed Cambridge residents.
The two orders relating to Vertex were sent to the City Manager’s office for a report to be completed and presented to the Council at a later date.
The Council also passed a resolution urging the telecommunications company Comcast to comply with the National Labor Relations Act, a series of union protection laws.
“We want people in our community to not live in fear,” said Jennifer A. Doe, an organizer with the community coalition Jobs with Justice, who stressed the need for regulations dealing with quality of life issues in the City’s contract with Comcast.
Cheung said the order addressed “another aspect of the tyranny of Comcast that reigns on this city.”
“It’s the minimum we can ask,” Cheung said. “I know they can afford it because they charge all of us too much.”
The resolution unanimously passed and was forwarded to the Cable TV, Telecommunications, and Public Utilities Committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tough seven-game losing streak, the Harvard men’s hockey team was in desperate need of a victory Friday night when league opponent Colgate came to town. When the Raiders scored within the first eight minutes, it appeared that the Crimson was headed for another defeat.
That’s when sophomore Danny Biega took control of the game. Leading the charge with three scores, Biega keyed Harvard’s win in a 6-2 trouncing of Colgate at the Bright Hockey Center.
“He played well,” said co-captain and defenseman Chris Huxley. “He’s an offensive threat and he plays well in the defensive zones.”
With the performance, Biega tallied the first hat trick of his young career.
“There are some nights you get some breaks and the puck seems to go your way,” Biega said. “The game against Colgate just happened to be one of those nights.”
“To get a hat trick is something pretty special,” Biega added.
With his performance Friday, the Montreal native now has 10 points in his last nine games.
It wasn’t the first Biega hat trick this season: older brother Michael accomplished the feat earlier this month against Brown.
But Friday night belonged to the younger Biega, who began his scoring tear just 13 seconds after the Raiders took the lead.
After fielding a missed shot by Alex Killorn, Michael Biega passed to sophomore Conor Morrison, who had the wherewithal to let the puck go by him and right to Danny Biega’s stick. From the slot, the sophomore fired the puck, which hit the left post before bounding into the back of the net.
But the goal did more than just even the game at one apiece.
“It was definitely a little bit of a momentum switch in the sense that we gained a little more life,” Biega said.
After sophomore Alex Fallstrom gave the Crimson the lead at the end of the first period, Biega continued to terrorize the Colgate back line. On the power play, Biega traded passes with Huxley before firing a shot from the point.
“We had a great screen in front of the net, and I didn’t think twice and shot it through the first penalty killer’s legs,” Biega said. “I don’t think the goalie had an opportunity to see it, so it found the back of the net.”
The score seemed to catalyze Harvard’s strong work on the power play.
“We haven’t been doing too well in the power play lately, so [the goal] gave our power play a lot of energy,” Huxley said. “And I think that correlated to us being much better on the power play over the weekend.”
But Biega wasn’t finished just yet. At the end of the third period, while in traffic at the Crimson’s defensive zone, Biega fired a shot on an empty Raiders net. The puck trickled past the line with only four seconds left to play.
“[All] of the goals were equally impressive,” Huxley said. “[But] the third one might have been the hardest one.”
The sophomore continued his high level the following night against Cornell. Harvard fell to the Big Red, 2-1, but Biega nearly gave Harvard a 2-1 advantage in the third period.
With just about six minutes to go, Biega flew down the left side of the ice. Killorn weaved the puck through a defender to find Biega’s backhand. Biega managed to get off a shot, but Cornell goaltender Andy Iles made a critical save to foil the attempt.
“[I] was just amazed at the save Andy Isle made,” Biega said. “He stuck his right leg out and lifted it up so [the puck] ended up hitting his right skate and then...the post.”
“[He was] within inches [of scoring],” Huxley added. “It wasn’t the only chance he had all game either.”
Biega was unable to lift his team to victory against Cornell Saturday night, but he still played a critical role in what could be the beginning of the Crimson’s turnaround.
“He’s a fast skater, [and] you have to honor him when he has the puck,” Huxley said. “He also has a really good shot too, and I think that showed this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Killer instinct.
Taken out of context it might sound like an accusation, but athletes know the moniker to be one of the highest compliments in many coaches’ lexicons.
One of the hardest and most rewarding parts of being an athlete at any level is learning to harness this instinct: to unleash it in the midst of competition and reign it in when sportsmanship and calmness are required.
The best athletes control their emotions, not the other way around.
And that mastery over the mind, that killer instinct, ultimately proves to be a necessity regardless of what one does in life.
And the more I see in the world, the more I am grateful for the experiences I’ve had in sports at all levels, from my participation in kickball and CYO basketball to my current membership on the Radcliffe Heavyweight rowing team.
Earlier this fall, one of my teammates found an article titled “Female Jocks Rule the World.” The author, Danielle Friedman, cites studies that have shown very strong correlations between female participation in youth sports and success later in life, both in education and in employment.
None of this surprises me.
Sports are some of the best resources girls have in middle school and high school.
While magazines and TV shows worry about girls’ appearances, female athletes’ coaches and teammates focus on what they can do.
But more than anything else I’ve seen, sports teach girls how to be aggressive and compete for the things they want. While middle school social life seems to be teaching girls to gossip, sports teach these same girls the importance of directness, sincerity, and commitment.
When I entered high school, I began to appreciate the importance of the standards I had been held to as a young athlete.
In my junior year of high school, I enrolled in honors precalculus, a famously hard class at my school. I hadn’t been the most talented math student in my first two years, so I was a little nervous about my prospects in the class. But I found that the challenging nature suited my personality well. One day I told my teacher that I enjoyed her class because it had “thrill factor.” What I meant was that I felt like an athlete again.
But sports teach more than aggression. They also provide girls with a ready group of female role models. In her article, Friedman notes that “women who played (or passionately follow, for that matter) sports gain unique access to ‘boys’ networks that they’d otherwise be excluded from, experts say.”
While this access is valuable, I’d argue that the entrance into all female networks is even more so. In school and in most other activities, females compete against both boys and girls or, depending on their age, men and women. But in sports, women usually only compete against members of their own gender (though there are exceptions).
And when a woman competes against other females, you can’t help but notice how talented and dedicated your peers are. My teammates here are some of the strongest people I’ve ever met.
Rowing with them has both shown me the ways in which I can improve myself and made me realize that this improvement is possible. I no longer worry about being “good for a girl” because I don’t believe that girls or women fall into a second-class category that would merit that kind of qualification.
I would be wrong to argue that athletes are a special breed of people. While I am constantly in awe of my teammates, I am often just as amazed by the accomplishments of women whose campus involvements are concentrated in areas outside of athletics. What I do believe is that involvement in sports gives its participants strengths that they can use after they hang up their cleats, ice skates, or Nikes.
As I grow older, sports and life become less and less different. Suddenly, my success in all areas of life is predicated on the same things I learned long ago in youth lacrosse: work with your teammates, fight through the fatigue, take risks, and always compete as hard as you can.
We’re always told that sports are a metaphor for life. Perhaps that’s just because sports offers us the first chance we get to see life as it is.

Though (thankfully) midterm season is not yet upon us, the Harvard men’s squash team is about to face some big tests.
The No. 6 Crimson plays four matches in the next eight days—three of which pit Harvard against one of the nation’s top three teams—to close out the regular season. After that, it’s straight to College Squash Association national championships for the Crimson.
The important matchups begin this weekend with a two game road trip down south (though not far enough south to be much warmer than it is in Cambridge).
This Saturday, Harvard begins its quest to compete at the top of the league against No. 10 Penn. The Crimson will have to recover quickly from the match against the Quakers if it wants a shot at No. 3 Princeton on Sunday.
After a few days of rest and recovery, the Crimson will host its two toughest opponents of the season. The matchups at Barnaby Courts begin Wednesday, Feb. 9 with No. 1 Trinity. The contest against the 12-time defending CSA team champions was postponed due to inclement weather last week.
The regular season comes to a close on Saturday, Feb. 12 against No. 2 Yale. A fitting end to any Ivy League campaign, the match against the Bulldogs is sure to be a difficult one.
With all of these important contests just around the corner, Harvard is busy getting ready for its final four regular-season tests, with an emphasis on being prepared without overdoing it.
“Right now, there’s not much to be done on the fitness level,” Crimson Coach Mike Way said. “We just have to maintain our fitness levels, and look for signs of burn out.”
“It’s about tapering…and making sure kids aren’t getting jaded,” he continued. “It’s possible to be ‘oversquashed’ and we want to [avoid that].”
