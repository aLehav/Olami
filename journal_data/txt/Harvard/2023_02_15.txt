Warning: minor spoilers and sudden urge to rewatch your favorite couple ahead.
Na Hee-do (Kim Tae-ri) and Baek Yi-jin (Nam Joo-hyuk) — “Twenty-Five, Twenty-One”
Na Hee-do (Kim Tae-ri) and Baek Yi-jin (Nam Joo-hyuk) — “Twenty-Five, Twenty-One”
Sometimes, first love doesn't work out, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth it. At its core, tvN’s hit drama “Twenty-Five Twenty-One” is a coming of age story about youths overcoming struggles to pursue their dreams in the uncertain world of post-1997 financial crash South Korea. Still, no viewers can resist the pull of the beautiful and realistic depiction of first love shared between the headstrong fencing prodigy, Na Hee-do, and the hardworking and responsible Baek Yi-jin. Despite the awkward (though hilarious) beginning to their relationship, Yi-jin and Hee-do soon show everyone the strength of their bond as they are there for each other even before the development of their romantic feelings. He is unwavering in his support of her dream to become a world-class fencer while her innocence and optimism provide him with the unexpected but necessary strength to overcome his struggles with his family’s bankruptcy. When they admit their feelings for each other (with the most heart-fluttering love confession ever), there is no doubt that they are perfect for each other. Though for many, the end is gut-wrenching after such a sweet beginning, but “Twenty-Five, Twenty-One” reminds the viewers that a love story doesn’t need a happy ending to be meaningful.
Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) and Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan) — “The Walking Dead”
Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) and Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan) — “The Walking Dead”
Bashing zombies’ heads while also navigating the worst of humanity in a post-apocalyptic world is probably not how one imagines meeting the love of their life. But “The Walking Dead”’s Glenn and Maggie do just that. After Maggie’s family offers the Atlanta survivors refuge in their farm at the beginning of season two, the pair soon become trusted allies, helping each other survive the increasingly dangerous threats from not just the undead but also their fellow survivors. It is a joy to see their partnership blossom into romance and love. Even though their future together is tragically and shockingly cut short, we have hope that in the afterlife, they will be together again, happy and safe at last. After all, as Glenn promises his wife: “Maggie, I will find you.”
The Doctor (David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi) and River Song (Alex Kingston) — “Doctor Who” (Season 4 — Season 9)
The Doctor (David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi) and River Song (Alex Kingston) — “Doctor Who” (Season 4 — Season 9)
This love story will tug at your heartstrings. The first time The Doctor (and viewers) meet formidable archeologist, Professor River Song, is when she sacrifices her life to save his and countless others trapped in a digital 51st century library planet. While that is the last time she sees him, it’s only the beginning of their wild and tragic journey for him. Being time travelers, The Doctor and River Song have a nonlinear relationship, meeting each other out of order across space and time-travel. For audiences, their flirtatious banter and bickering are a wild but enjoyable ride throughout the seasons as the Doctor goes from distrusting River to risking himself to help her to going on years — long dates (it’s very timey-wimey complicated), until the full circle moment where her final time seeing him is his first time meeting her. However, the tragedy behind their relationship isn’t the only reason why audiences are drawn toward their doomed romance. Rather, it is thanks to the electrifying chemistry between Alex Kingston’s River and the many iterations of her husband/wife, whether it’s David Tennant, Matt Smith, or Peter Capaldi that proves to audiences that River Song is truly the Doctor’s wife. No matter if it’s the Tenth Doctor, Eleventh, Twelfth, or beyond, River Song is perhaps the only one in the universe who is capable of going toe to toe with the Doctor. The 2015 Christmas special “The Husbands of River Song” has shown us the final moment of River Song’s life before her momentous trip to the library, nevertheless, due to the creatively complicated structure of “Doctor Who,” hopefully we may see her yet again, this time interacting with the brand new iteration of her husband, the 15th Doctor, Ncuyi Gatwa.
Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) and Villanelle (Jodie Comer) — “Killing Eve”
Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) and Villanelle (Jodie Comer) — “Killing Eve”
Sometimes, love can be violent, especially if one is a psychopathic assassin and the other is the dutiful spy being tasked with capturing them. Oh and Comer redefine the genre of enemies-to-lovers as British spy Eve Polastri follows ruthless assassin Villanelle in a breath-taking game of cat and mouse. They are a couple that will not let pesky things like mutual feelings prevent each other from accomplishing their opposing goals. Despite their tendency to inflict physical harm on each other — including a stab to the gut and a shot to the back to give a few examples — to get what they want, at the end of the day, no one can deny that Eve and Villanelle’s feelings for each other are true. In fact, it is the toxic and dangerous aspect of their dynamic that delights and makes viewers want to go back to episode one and rewatch their journey together. After all, love isn’t always neat and happy. Sometimes, it’s chaotic and painful in the best way possible.
Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) and Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper) — “The Good Place”
Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) and Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper) — “The Good Place”
Soulmates are overrated, unless they're Eleanor (Kristen Bell) and Chidi (William Jackson Harper). The star-crossed lovers from “The Good Place” are brought together in the afterlife purely because their different personalities are the perfect recipe for an after-lifetime of torture. However, Chidi and Eleanor turn out to be a match made in Heaven (Hell?). Together, they learn, grow, and change to become better versions of themselves all the while saving each other from the Bad Place over and over and over again — while simultaneously falling back in love countless times during their punishment in the Bad Place. For two people who are meant to be each other’s eternal punishments, their star-crossed love story only solidifies the couple’s status as meant-to-be. By the end of the series, there is no doubt about the extent of the love shared between Eleanor and Chidi. They both learn to put the other first, even overcoming their fatal flaws in life — Eleanor’s selfishness and Chidi’s inability to make a decision — even if it means they will have to say goodbye. But hey, if heartbreak isn’t love, what is?
Honorable Mentions:
Yoon Sep-ri (Son Ye-jin) and Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) — “Crash Landing on You”
This star-crossed love story between South Korean chaebol heiress Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) and North Korean captain Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) tugs at our heartstrings and brings together Korean showbiz’s most powerful couple. While the geopolitics of their nations mean they are only given a few weeks per year to be together, at least we can cheer for the real life relationship between Son Ye-jin and Hyun Bin who welcomed their first child late last year after a fairytale wedding in March 2022.
Barry Allen (Grant Austin) and Iris West (Candice Patton) — “The Flash”
Despite several missed opportunities, multiple love interests, and a couple of near-death experiences, Barry Allen and Iris West were finally able to get together in the 2017’s “Crisis on Earth X” crossover event of the Arrowverse. With “The Flash” returning for its 9th and final season this month, we can only hope that Barry and Iris‘s epic love can hold strong to give them a happy ending.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When we learned about the printing press, it probably went something like this: Johannes Gutenberg’s invention kickstarted an information revolution and, most directly, the pamphlet-powered Protestant Reformation, which led us out of the Dark Ages into the Enlightenment.
The history seems slightly obvious — boring, even.
But this linear narrative of the printing press — a smooth crescendo from medieval Europe to the scientific revolution — is a case of revisionist history. It gets two big things wrong.
First, we underestimate the printing press’s impact. Before its advent, disseminating knowledge with scribes was akin to a very slow-moving, leaky bucket; most information wasn’t written down and what was would gradually get lost in translation. With the printing press, knowledge could finally be preserved. This invention led to more than just a bunch of people reading new books – for the first time, knowledge could compound and scale effectively.
These changes in information flow produced correspondingly large shocks to the previous world order. By enabling the Protestant Reformation, the dominant European power and single source of truth, the Catholic Church, lost its monopoly on moral authority within one century. And the worldview of a continent was rocked by publications on the work of Copernicus, who placed the Sun, not the Earth (nor the human), at the center of the universe.
To illustrate the magnitude of these changes, just imagine the United States, or the European Union, crumbling within a short century — or imagine an encounter with aliens fundamentally shattering our idea of the universe. That is what followed the advent of the printing press.
Second, besides the importance of the innovation, we forget about the negative consequences the printing press brought. Many, including Martin Luther, the seminal leader of the Protestant Reformation himself, worried the printing press would destroy society by allowing misinformation, or — in 15th-century jargon — the message of the antichrist, to spread. And indeed, the printing press was used to spread falsehoods as much as enlightened truth, which resulted in unprecedented confusion for society.
Put simply, the age of the printing press was hardly the fairy tale we often tell about it. For those living through it, this was a period of drastic, confusing, and scary change; it destabilized a continent.
This post-disruption messiness was hardly unique to the printing press; it followed many great inventions. Even the Arabic numerals we use today were banned for centuries in favor of Roman numerals because of their controversial concept of zero — of “nothingness.”
We see a pattern emerge: Discomfort accompanies progress. In many ways, it is a great proxy for innovation. Counterintuitively, comfort should be worrisome because it might be a sign of stagnation.
It is important to relearn this fact after having airbrushed the hardship and discomfort out of the history of progress. If we don’t, we risk seeing our current challenges as unique and unsurmountable.
In the past few decades, for example, the proliferation of the internet — and, now, the first inning of artificial intelligence — has been challenging and destabilizing. Between Big Tech platforms exercising quasi-political power over nation-states, social media’s effect on teenagers, disinformation campaigns at home and abroad, and recent fears about generative AI’s effect on creative work, our institutions and societal fabric are being put under the pressure of information accelerationism.
In the context of previous inventions like the printing press, we understand that the problems we are facing are a necessary companion to innovation. They are part of the story of progress.
Additionally, there are two more lessons we can draw from the history of the printing press. First, if the advance of the internet or artificial intelligence is anything close to the proliferation of print — which we believe to be true — then we should expect a similar order of magnitude of societal change. And the history of the printing press tells us that these shifts are drastic and ultimately positive, yet hard to piece together as you’re living through them. The only piece you do feel in the moment is the friction.
Second, the need for action. While we must be confident, it is equally important not to succumb to blind techno-optimism. In fact, it is essential for us to worry. Only through worrying will we take the necessary steps to check against the negative excesses of the technologies we create. This was true for the printing press; academics worried about the technology’s potential for misinformation, for example, invented the index and the bibliography in response. Many similar stories exist of these “productive worriers” shaping the trajectory of once-unchecked technologies.
Gutenberg invented the printing press almost six centuries ago. Today, GPT shows us what the next chapter of the journey he has set us on can look like. To continue to navigate new technologies successfully, we need to learn from our past, but many of our discussions today suffer from an essentialized history of technology – either it was all bad and we are doomed, or it was a straight, smooth line toward progress.
Since the technologies we are developing are increasingly more powerful, both views are dangerous. Blind optimism and doomsday pessimism intersect in inaction. But if we are skeptically optimistic, and embrace the challenges new technologies present us with, we will be able to take advantage of our new tools to create a better future.

I’ve never celebrated Valentine's Day with a valentine. For me, this holiday has never consisted of a date, or a box of chocolates, or a kiss, or someone to hold or be held by. It’s been a rather hollow holiday for my whole life, but I love it nonetheless because I love love. I think we all ought to celebrate love, even if we don’t currently have the type of love Valentine’s Day is typically understood to celebrate. But there are other reasons to celebrate this day, too.
Valentine’s Day shares a date with another important holiday: the birthday of preeminent abolitionist and statesman Fredrick Douglass. Born into enslavement, Douglass earned his spot as one of the most influential and celebrated Americans to ever live.
His birthday represents far more than an ordinary birthday. Douglass, like many enslaved people, had his birthday taken away from him. He never knew the true date — only that it was likely sometime in February. Because his mother called him her “Little Valentine,” he chose February 14th to celebrate his birthday, reasserting his personhood and defying the dehumanization of his enslavement.
For centuries, Black holidays and celebrations have been forged and fought for — history has shown that they aren’t just a given. As we look beyond Valentine’s Day, we should view the entirety of Black History Month in this light. This month-long celebration is a way to honor the previously forgotten, unmarked, and unmemorialized love Black Americans have poured into this country and our own liberation in the face of a past and present of racist violence and dehumanization. Black History Month provides us a framework for marking those unremembered contributions.
I’ve heard a few times that Black History Month relegates the history of Black Americans to a limited timeframe (the shortest month of the year, at that), but the dates bookending a celebration don’t have to limit its acknowledgement or belittle its importance. Regardless, it remains incredibly important to have a regular, structured time to celebrate all of the contributions Black Americans have made to this country, particularly those we don’t have dates for. We should imagine this month not as an all-encompassing celebration of the history we do know, but rather as an opportunity to commemorate the stories that have gone unarchived and forgotten.
The lost archive of Black history doesn’t just include the names on slave ledgers, or the physical demarcations of sexual violence in my genome, or the hope in a simple hymn. Much about the lives of my ancestors will never be accessible to me; it has been taken from me.
So this month is about another project, too, that Douglass was instrumental in launching. He initiated a process of self-memorialization in a world that didn’t want him to be actualized in the first place. He was, for a long time, the most photographed American ever. Douglass filled the photobooks, the calendar, and the archives of Blackness, all of which had been hollowed out and kept empty for generations — he advanced the self-memorialization of the whole race.
To thrive and survive as a Black person in a white space, we must research, acknowledge, celebrate, and share our accomplishments — the big, communal ones, but also the small, personal ones. This project necessitates the constant discovery and celebration of new holidays that catalog the work, fights, wins, and losses that don’t have dates on our calendar. That the history behind the Black American experience cannot fit neatly in February doesn’t mean that Black History Month isn’t a worthy endeavor.
I do understand that holidays like these can also spur apprehension and sadness. It is painful for anyone to celebrate themselves, or their ancestors, or the love in their life, when so much history was purposefully erased. It’s like building without a foundation.
Indeed, Black History Month and all the holidays it contains are bittersweet for me. But they are better celebrated now than never. Hopefully, in celebrating these holidays, we hold ourselves to building a better future, treating the people around us with respect and dignity, and loving ourselves a little more every day.
For me, this means commemorating Fredrick Douglass’s Birthday, celebrating the interracial, queer love that created my family this Valentine’s Day, and always remembering how thankful I am for the Black leaders that fought for my ability to be where I am today. As for the rest of the month, let the love flow freely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Psychotherapy as we know it has been around for about a century, and has been continually refined since.
So why do placebo treatments perform almost equally as well? What is it that actually makes therapy so effective at treating mental illness — and what could a placebo share in common?
In the 1980s, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program, a large-scale randomized control trial that eventually formed the scientific basis for the belief that therapy is effective. The study showed that interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy worked equivalently well to antidepressants for reducing the symptoms of depression.
In the following three decades, psychotherapy — especially short-term, manualized therapy of the kind tested in the study — has exploded in popularity as a front-line treatment for mental illness.
Still, there’s more to the story.
A closer look at the NIMH-TDCRP’s results reveals a curious phenomenon: The therapies and antidepressants barely outperform placebo treatment. On the 54 point Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, CBT does, on average, 1.2 points better than a sugar pill combined with weekly meetings with a psychiatrist.
This is not to say that therapy didn’t work — in all treatment groups, depression symptoms were reduced from severe to mild. Rather, it is to say that there was nothing specifically effective about the psychotherapies: A sugar pill and weekly meetings with a psychiatrist to discuss the effects of the ‘treatment’ were also comparably effective.
So why is a sugar pill performing on the level of state of the art therapy and antidepressants? The most plausible answer goes deeper than what pharmaceutical companies describe as “chemical imbalances in the brain.” The only explanation for the efficacy of the sugar pill lies beyond the pill — in the psychiatrist’s caring relationship with the patient.
In meta-analysis after meta-analysis, almost every (vastly different) approach to psychotherapy is similarly effective at treating depression. This begs the question: Are there certain factors that all therapies have in common that make them effective? Most centrally, if the theory you choose doesn’t matter for outcomes, then what makes therapy work?
This phenomenon, known as the “dodo-bird verdict,” has stoked controversy in the field for almost a century. It dates back to the 1930s, when American psychologist Saul Rosenzweig mused that what might matter for the efficacy of therapy is not the philosophy, but the human relationship beneath it all.
Arguably the foremost modern theorist of this phenomenon, Bruce Wampold, proposes that therapy is a special case of a “social healing practice,” and is thus a specific practice of the basic human act of taking care of each other. In this view, therapeutic efficacy is based on three key things: the real relationship between the therapist and the patient, the plausible explanation of symptoms, and the encouragement of health promoting actions.
With a model like this, the sugar pill’s effects don’t seem so ridiculous. Though the patient is taking medication with virtually no active ingredients, they are still consistently meeting with a trusted psychiatrist, both parties expect and believe that the pills treat depression, and the psychiatrist continually encourages behavior that improves wellbeing.
In the same way, because all therapies are built upon a real relationship, have reasonable narratives, and promote healthy behavior, their rates of success are bound to be similar.
The consequences of this being true — and, in my view, it really seems to be the most plausible explanation — would have massive public health implications. It isn’t that therapy is no better than a placebo. It’s that relationships of care and support are the most fundamental component of psychological well-being, whether or not they’re embedded within a medical system.
Our best hope of dealing with this era’s mental health crisis is through the realization that the things that make psychotherapy effective are not limited to psychotherapy at all. Mentoring, supporting, and taking care of each other is as old as human history, and though it’s not a pharmaceutical, it’s no placebo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Public Schools launched a free 24/7 chat-based tutoring service in late January to provide students in the district with additional support outside the classroom.
Partnering with educational technology company Paper, CPS introduced the program for students in fifth to 12th grade last month, according to a CPS press release. The service connects Cambridge students with undergraduates, doctoral candidates, and teachers to provide tutoring in four different languages across a wide range of subjects.
Victoria L. Greer, the district’s superintendent, said this program hopes to mitigate a decline in student academic achievement brought on by the educational challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Greer, students faced a “very difficult time, both socially and academically” in navigating virtual and hybrid learning amid the pandemic.
“Post-pandemic, we really were trying to think of ways that would allow us to support students in re-acclimating to school,” she said.
Meg Ramsdell, a CPS parent and executive director for Cambridge School Volunteers — a nonprofit that works with CPS to provide in-person tutoring assistance — said “there’s a lot of room for various support for students.”
While some students may only use online tutoring services for individual assignments, Ramsdell said in-person volunteers like those at Cambridge School Volunteers work to provide a “long-term relationship” guiding students academically.
“I can see a case for both for students needing either of those,” Ramsdell said.
Greer said that the new 24/7 chat-based tutoring program seeks to support secondary students whose late-night study habits make it difficult for them to access homework help in real time.
“They don’t have the support they need,” she said. “We knew that this would offer that additional support that students need in order for them to get their work done and be successful.”
Grace Clemente, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin School senior and Cambridge School Committee student representative, said that while this additional support is “incredible,” she wonders whether the district will succeed at “targeting the students that need it the most.”
The district publicized the new initiative on its website, as well as ParentSquare, a communication platform between CPS and families. Adelina R. Escamilla-Salomon, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin senior on the School Committee, said that students who are “already high-achieving” are often the ones who primarily utilize additional resources.
“I just wonder who will be learning about this and who will actually be able to utilize it,” she said.
“Not every student has a parent that is advocating for their needs or understands their needs, outside of home and in the classroom,” Clemente added.
In response to equity concerns, Greer said she will work with educators to raise awareness of the resources available to students in the district. The first step is “ensuring that the different adults who connect closer” with students are aware of the tools and “make it available and share with them,” Greer added.
Escamilla-Salomon said while she supports the new program, a broader plan is needed to ensure equal access to educational resources for all CPS students.
“It’s really about figuring out how students can have the most access — especially those who need it most — in order to really bridge that equity gap, so students can actually achieve as high as the district wants them to and as high as they’re capable of,” she said.

Laspau, a Harvard-affiliated nonprofit that promotes higher education in Latin America and the Caribbean, will shut down after the University decided to revoke its affiliate status.
Harvard co-founded Laspau in 1966 as the Latin American Scholarship Program of American Universities to provide undergraduate students from Latin America with grants to study in the United States. The nonprofit, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016, now provides support to institutions of higher learning in Latin America and the Caribbean through educational programs for students and faculty.
In an email obtained by The Crimson, Angélica M. Natera, the executive director of Laspau, wrote in January to the Harvard Office of the Provost that the organization’s board of trustees “determined that without the Harvard affiliation, Laspau will be unable to fulfill its mission and serve its stakeholders.”
“On October 1, 2023, Laspau will begin the process of winding down its operations and concluding its inspirational journey of serving the Americas and representing Harvard,” Natera wrote in the email.
Harvard University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed in a statement to The Crimson that the University is revoking Laspau’s status as a Harvard affiliate.
“This is the result of a very long and thoughtful process that ultimately ended in the decision that Harvard and Laspau’s missions did not align,” Newton wrote. “However, Harvard continues to have deep and wide engagement in Latin America.”
Natera underscored Laspau’s close collaboration with Harvard in the email to the Provost’s Office.
“The close connection with Harvard has been critical to Laspau’s work in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as with U.S. universities,” Natera wrote. “Harvard has been the institutional home for Laspau staff, and the partnership has contributed to Laspau’s success in building institutions and in advancing teaching and research in the Region.”
Natera declined to comment on Harvard’s decision to strip Laspau of its affiliate status during an interview on Tuesday, but said the nonprofit’s demise will leave a large hole for the students and scholars it serves.
“There are many other organizations doing good work as well, but we are very focused in, precisely, in higher education in Latin America and the Caribbean, but also with a profound and extensive network with U.S. institutions of higher education,” Natera said.
“The organization is dedicated and very proud of the work,” Natera added. “I think we are leaving an important legacy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Divinity School senior lecturer Dan P. McKanan ’89 discussed the role slavery played in the school’s founding in a lecture Monday evening.
The talk is the third event in the “Religion and the Legacies of Slavery” series, which aims to host conversations about the history of slavery through the lens of religion. The series builds upon Harvard’s landmark Legacy of Slavery report, which was released in April 2022 and detailed the “integral” role slavery played in the University’s formation.
McKanan outlined how the Legacy of Slavery report revealed HDS’ deep entanglement with slavery.
He discussed three individuals with ties to HDS who came from families with fortunes derived from enslavement — William E. Channing, class of 1798, a prominent Unitarian preacher who McKanan called the “visionary behind the founding” of HDS; Thomas W. Higginson, class of 1841, a minister, abolitionist, and HDS graduate; and John G. Palfrey, class of 1815, the first dean of HDS.
“It’s easy to assume that slavery was a relatively distant reality for the Divinity School’s founders and early students,” McKanan said. “The truth revealed by the report is that the founders of the Divinity School — many of them — were much more entangled with enslavement than most New Englanders of their generation.”
McKanan spoke about how Channing, Higginson, and Palfrey grappled with the “moral injury” of inheriting wealth from enslavement.
He said Channing privileged the perspectives of white abolitionists over enslaved people revolting against their enslavers.
“Whereas Haitian slaves rose up and fought for their freedom, emancipation in the British Caribbean occurred in response to agitation by white abolitionists who were inspired by their Christian faith,” he said.
“Channing fundamentally thought of slavery from the perspective of white people who faced the choice of whether or not to participate in enslavement,” McKanan added. “And that prevented him from recognizing the Haitian Revolution, or other acts of Black liberation as divinely inspired.”
While some historians have called Channing an abolitionist due to his vehement opposition to slavery and participation in abolitionist groups, McKanan disputed that characterization because Channing never accepted “the core claim of Black and white abolitionists of his time,” that enslavers were sinners who deserved to be expelled from Christian communities.
McKanan then discussed the involvement of the prominent Perkins family, who made a large fortune trading enslaved people in the Caribbean and donated large sums of money to Harvard University and the Perkins School for the Blind.
“The Perkins were utterly indifferent to the suffering that surrounded them,” he said. “Sarah Paine Perkins wrote that she believed that slaves experienced no more mental anguish than mules when they were whipped.”
McKanan took time to recognize his own position as a descendant of settler colonialists and the inherited wealth he has received through Harvard that derived from enslavement.
“Some combination of guilt and moral injury has led those who profited from enslavement to turn their wealth into philanthropy, but that philanthropy has mostly benefited their own descendants and others like them,” he said. “It is up to us now to expand our imagination, of which ancestors and which descendants count.”

Early in the morning on Valentine’s Day, more than 4,300 Harvard undergraduates eagerly awaited an email that could fundamentally alter the course of their lives: their Datamatch results.
Datamatch, a free matchmaking platform managed by Harvard undergraduates, pairs users by an algorithm based on their responses to a 16-question survey. This year, the questionnaire asked students questions on various topics ranging from charcuterie boards to the inevitable Datamatch ‘walk of shame,’ all in an attempt to match them with their soulmates, whether romantic or platonic.
The website allows students to reserve a date with their top matches at a Harvard Square eatery — including Kung Fu Tea, Berryline, or Taiyaki NYC — with Datamatch footing the bill.
Alex V. Cheng ’23-’24 and Chelsea E. Guo ’23-’24 lead the members of Datamatch’s administrative team — known as Cupids — who expand and improve the service from year to year.
This year’s Datamatch debuted an updated user interface, which Guo described as a “retro-like, video game-y aesthetic.”
“It looks very different. It looks very clean. It looks very homey and retro,” she said. “But it still has that same thing that everybody loves about Datamatch.”
This year’s edition of Datamatch also allows participants to complete optional personality-related fields on their profile, such as their Myers-Briggs personality types, Rice Purity Test scores, and astrological signs.
“These are fun side projects that the members of our algorithm team wanted to do, just as fun personality-related things that some people at Harvard might want to share with each other or might want to factor into who gets matched with them,” Guo said.
Available at more than 40 universities, Datamatch was founded by a group of Harvard students in 1994. This year, the platform logged over 35,000 users across the United States, Canada, and the UK.
“We’re always trying to drive up sign-up numbers and expand to as many schools as possible,” Cheng said. “We’re always on the hunt for new schools.”
According to Datamatch’s website, its service is “primarily meant to be humorous and casual,” but by using the matchmaking service, “there’s always a chance of finding a lasting relationship.”
Some users have been successful in those endeavors, while others use the platform in hopes of landing a successful date.
Nehir Toklu ’25 wrote to The Crimson that she met her boyfriend through the survey last year.
“I filled it out because it just feels like a fun date-ish meet up — and having the excuse of free food felt like a really good opportunity to meet people,” she wrote.
Jeremy M. Williams ’26 called Datamatch “the place to be,” adding that he was looking to meet new friends.
“I found myself single recently, so it just seemed to be what I had to do,” he added.
Other students said they bonded with their friends over the survey and its humorous questions.
Returning user Leticia J. Sefia ’25 said she decided to participate in Datamatch because she found last year’s survey questions funny.
“I didn’t think it would actually be funnier than last year, but it somehow was,” she said.
Jackelyn G. Baldwin ’24 said one of her classmates hosted a get-together for her class to fill out Datamatch at the same time.
“We all just showed up, pulled out our computers, and did the survey together,” she said. “It’s just a really cute and wholesome experience.”
Kevin Ray ’24 said he was not initially interested in participating but changed his mind at the last minute.
“I was talking to my friends about it, and they all did it. And I was like, ‘Why not?’ because it’s free food,” he said.
Cheng, one of the Datamatch Cupids, said he has been inspired to organize Datamatch for the past three years because of the joy the tradition brings.
“It’s just a fun way to meet people, and I enjoy helping facilitate that and encouraging connections across campus,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents and councilors passionately debated weekend traffic closures on Memorial Drive at a Cambridge City Council meeting Monday.
“Policy Order 5” — which would extend the traffic closure at Riverbend Park in front of Harvard’s river houses — drew a substantial number of public comments, including from Harvard students and other residents who do not regularly attend Council meetings.
Several commenters, who identified themselves as Harvard affiliates, said students and other Cambridge residents significantly benefit from the closure of Memorial Drive on Saturdays.
“Memorial Drive is one of the urban jewels of the city of Cambridge,” said Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor. “I urge you to consider the value and potential of Memorial Drive as a public space that can continue bringing us together and leading us toward a more sustainable and resilient future.”
Other residents from outside Harvard also said they support the traffic closure and its benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.
“As a senior citizen, I appreciate having a safe place to exercise, especially a green, open space where I can be surrounded by beautiful trees and where I can appreciate the Charles River,” said local resident Sandra Fairbank.
Other residents said they strongly opposed the policy order and urged the city to pay more attention to those whose homes are on streets that see traffic from Memorial Drive on weekends.
“That’s really wonderful that it’s being enjoyed, but we’re the ones who are losing the quality of life on the other side of it, and I don’t hear anyone talking about the quality of life that the residents have been enduring,” said Sheila Headley-Burwell, who is also a member of the City Manager’s Advisory Committee.
“I’m not saying that these people should not enjoy it; I’m saying that what they want gone is now on our doorstep,” Headley-Burwell added.
City Councilor E. Denise Simmons exercised her “charter right” on the policy order, thereby delaying a decision on the matter, due to her objections on behalf of people living on the detour streets.
“The Memorial Drive debate has echoes of so many past battles in which the voices of concerned neighbors, Black people, moderate-income people, minorities, people who are often referred to as the have-nots among us, have been so callously, casually, and dismissively brushed aside,” she said.
Simmons characterized the opposition to Riverside residents’ concerns as insensitive to the historical dismissal of people from marginalized groups in Cambridge.
“The response is, ‘The benefits of the many outweigh the inconveniences of a few, so too bad for you,’” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After launching a public card campaign to unionize Harvard’s non-tenure-track faculty on Feb. 6, Harvard Academic Workers-United Automobile Workers held their first public rallies Tuesday.
More than 100 students, faculty, and public officials attended rallies in Harvard Yard and at the Longwood campus, where HAW-UAW organizers urged attendees to sign union authorization cards.
“Harvard has the capacity to treat us fairly and it chooses not to,” Harvard Extension School instructor Michaela J. Thompson said in a speech in Harvard Yard. “At every turn, we have been shown time and time again that they do not care if we are underpaid, undersupported, and overworked.”
HAW-UAW is demanding a contract with the University that ensures higher compensation, job security, and broader workplace protections.
Many non-tenure-track faculty — a group which includes lecturers, postdoctoral fellows, preceptors, and adjunct faculty — face “time caps” on their employment, limiting them to a certain number of years at Harvard depending on their position.
Thompson, who timed out of her role as a preceptor in June 2022, said in a speech that time caps are arbitrary limits not based on job performance.
“Timing out means that I was fired,” she said.
Yiddish preceptor and rally organizer Sara M. Feldman said that organizers were told before and during the Covid-19 pandemic that the time cap system is a way to keep the curriculum and teaching fresh.
“We were told that it was necessary for nimbleness — that we are expected to burn out and need replacing because we will be so exhausted at our jobs,” she said.
Non-tenure-track faculty also spoke about being unable to afford adequate child care or rent without having roommates, adding that they are not provided with dental insurance.
“$50 billion endowment and you can’t give us dental, Harvard?” Thompson said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
In addition to members of Harvard’s unions, organizers from other universities and workplaces joined Tuesday’s rallies, including members of Boston University Graduate Workers Union, MIT Graduate Student Union, Alphabet Workers Union, and the Boston School Bus Drivers’ Union.
“It’s important to have friends, especially given that the climate at Harvard hasn’t been very friendly to unions,” Feldman said. “But the unions are each other’s friends, and we have each other’s backs.”
Organizers from Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers paused their regular informational picketing campaign to join Tuesday’s rally in Harvard Yard.
“I just want to say that we have been standing beside you guys side-by-side doing this important work that we have here at Harvard University,” said HUCTW Vice President Natasha S. Williams.
Local politicians including Boston City Councilor Kenzie Bok ’11, Somerville City Council President and Harvard postdoc Ben S. Ewen-Campen and Massachusetts state representatives Mike Connolly and Erika Uyterhoeven spoke at the rallies, calling on Harvard to voluntarily recognize HAW-UAW.
“I call on them to work with the leaders of this union and to recognize you as you organize and to negotiate with you and not to intimidate or throw up roadblocks,” Connolly said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) publicly endorsed HAW-UAW’s unionization campaign on social media.
Thomas A. Dichter ’08, a lecturer in History and Literature, read a statement of support from Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) at the Longwood rally.
“I applaud the workers exercising their right to organize and stay engaged with their coworkers in this most fundamental exercise in democracy,” Markey’s statement read.
Harvard may choose to voluntarily recognize HAW-UAW should it gain majority approval from non-tenure-track employees. Otherwise, if 30 percent of non-tenure-track employees sign authorization cards, HAW-UAW may petition the National Labor Relations Board for a union election, which requires a majority vote to certify the union.
“When I look out into the crowd, I can see a future where there is a union in every workplace at Harvard, a future where there is a union in every workplace in Massachusetts, and a future where there is a union in every workplace everywhere,” said HGSU-UAW organizer Alexandra C. Stanton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON ––– “I wanted revenge.”
After giving up eight goals to the No. 9 Harvard men’s ice hockey team on New Year’s Day, Northeastern Huskies goaltender Devon Levi wanted another chance to beat the Crimson, only this time, on Boston’s biggest stage.
“I wanted Harvard to beat [Boston College]. I wanted to see them in the finals again. They put on a clinic against me and I wanted revenge,” Levi said.
After Monday night’s dramatic Beanpot championship victory for his No. 16 Northeastern University Huskies, revenge is exactly what he got.
In a tense, raucous, and evenly-played Beanpot title game at T.D. Garden, the Huskies emerged victorious over the Crimson with a 3-2 shootout victory, the first time in the tournament’s 70-year history that a Beanpot game had been decided in a shootout following a recent NCAA rule change.
Both teams overcame deficits on the way to overtime, backed by outstanding performances from their goaltenders. Levi, the tournament MVP, made 32 saves in regulation and overtime, narrowly outdueling senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson, who stopped 27 of 29 shots before allowing the shootout’s lone goal.
Levi shut down some of the Crimson’s best players in the shootout, stopping junior forward Sean Farrell, sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, and junior forward Alex Laferriere in the three rounds. Northeastern’s sole shootout tally was provided by Milton, Mass. native Aidan McDonough, the Huskies’ captain, and Levi’s stop of Laferriere’s shot on the next attempt won the tournament for the Huskies, sending the Northeastern banner into the T.D. Garden rafters.
“[I] want to congratulate Northeastern. I thought it was a heck of a college hockey game,” head coach Ted Donato’91 said. “Both sides probably would have agreed that it's a tough way to lose the Beanpot Championship but I think they deserve a lot of credit. I’m very proud of our guys as well.”
Harvard jumped out to a strong start after the opening puck drop. First-year forward Joe Miller fired a hard one-timer on Levi early on after a low-to-high play, but Levi gloved the puck to stop play. First-year forward Marek Hejduk, the hero of last Monday’s semifinals against Boston College, had an opportunity to knock in a rebound when he was left alone in front of the net, but he was unable to corral the loose puck. Soon after, the Huskies recorded their first dangerous chance of the game, as Gibson denied an attempted wrap-around before the Crimson defense cleared the rebound out of the crease. Harvard continued to fire pucks on Levi from all angles, but senior forward and captain John Farinacci and sophomore forward Alex Gaffney were unable to jam the puck past Levi after a particularly lively rebound. Neither team generated many high-danger chances in the second half of the first period, with both defenses and goalies tightly defending the dangerous areas of the ice, and the first frame ended in a scoreless tie.
Despite the slow start, both teams came out hot at the start of the second period. On the Huskies’ first offensive possession, forward Gunnarwolfe Fontaine received a great cross ice pass off the rush, but his shot missed wide of the net. However, Northeastern immediately regained control of the puck and after a shot from the point by forward Sam Colangelo was knocked down in front, Fontaine cleaned up the rebound in the crease to give the Huskies a 1-0 lead.
It didn’t take long for Harvard to respond in kind. Less than a minute later, senior forward Austin Wong was cross-checked into the boards in the offensive zone, earning a two-minute power play.
Harvard’s lethal power play unit, which ranked 12th in the nation with a 23.9% conversion rate entering the game, only needed 38 seconds to knot the game at 1-1. Sophomore defenseman Ian Moore, quarterbacking the top power play unit, found Farrell at the right faceoff circle, and the Hopkinton, Mass. native fired a perfect cross-ice pass to Coronato at the left circle, where the sophomore hammered a one-timer past Levi to tie the game.
“We knew Harvard’s got a really good power play,” Northeastern head coach Jerry Keefe said. “You saw how dangerous they were because they got one on the power play…[We wanted] to make sure we weren't taking careless penalties but still playing with the motion and doing it the right way.”
The Crimson kept its offensive attack moving at even strength, and Coronato tallied his second goal of the game only six minutes after his opening strike. After senior defenseman Ryan Siedem launched a hard shot from the point, Levi made the save but failed to locate the rebound as the puck floated in the air. When it landed, Coronato, waiting on the doorstep, pounced on the loose change and lifted the puck past an out-of-position Levi and into the open net, giving Harvard a 2-1 lead roughly halfway through the game.
Shortly after Coronato’s go-ahead marker, the Huskies began to push back, and in the remainder of the period, Gibson shined. The Huskies maintained the majority of possession for the rest of the second period, keeping the puck in the offensive zone for a number of extended shifts. Fontaine had a great chance on a one-timer at point blank range, but his rocket whistled wide with five minutes to play. Northeastern also had a chance to tie the score on a chaotic scramble in the crease following a wrap-around, but senior forward and captain Baker Shore got in the way and helped save a sure goal, maintaining the 2-1 Crimson advantage heading to the final 20 minutes.
Unlike Harvard’s Beanpot semifinal contest, when Boston College tied the score with less than two minutes left in the third period, the Huskies wasted no time finding their equalizer with their tournament hopes on the line. Less than five minutes into the period, Fontaine slipped behind Shore and sophomore defenseman Kyle Aucoin in front of the net, and Northeastern defenseman Jayden Struble fed him a perfect pass that he simply tapped into the yawning net, evening the score at 2-2.
“They were just two great plays by two teammates of mine, Jayden Struble and Sam Colangelo,” said Fontaine regarding his two goals. “They set me up in front and I was lucky to get some empty netters there.”
For the final 15 minutes of action, both goaltenders put on a clinic, making numerous highlight-reel saves to keep their squads in the game. With only 10 minutes to play in regulation, senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun, returning from a one-game injury absence, made a great move to create space at the blue line, but Levi denied both his long-range shot and a rebound attempt by Drkulec at close range. Only two minutes later, a careless play by the Huskies’ defense left Miller alone with the puck rolling towards Levi, but the Quebec native made a brilliant poke check to disrupt Miller’s chance.
Gibson made two brilliant saves on the next shift, denying both forward Justin Hryckowian’s one-timer and forward Matt Choupani’s stuff-in attempt on the rebound. The Crimson hit two posts in the waning minutes of regulation, with both Coronato and sophomore forward Alex Gaffney coming inches away from giving Harvard a late lead, and after Northeastern couldn’t capitalize on an offensive zone faceoff with 15 seconds to play, the Beanpot championship game headed to a five minute 3-on-3 overtime period for the first time in its illustrious history.
While Levi stole the show in the third period with 14 saves, Gibson put on a show of his own in sudden-death overtime, keeping Harvard’s title hopes alive. After Farrell turned the puck over in the offensive zone, Huskies defenseman Vinny Borgesi skated in all alone with a chance to win the Beanpot title, but the Pennsylvanian flashed the leather to shut down the breakaway with a glove save. After making back-to-back saves on Fontaine and Colangelo, Gibson stopped another breakaway, squeezing his legs together to stop Hryckowian after he split the defense at the Crimson’s defensive blueline. In the final seconds of the extra session, Coronato had a golden chance from the slot to win the championship, but Levi’s big left pad denied his wrister as time expired, sending the Beanpot title showdown to its first-ever decisive shootout.
“I think both [Gibson and Levi] made it look fairly easy at times. There's a lot of stress, [with] one goal [scored] for the last 15 minutes and in the five minute overtime,” Donato said. “I thought [Gibson] played great and obviously Levi’s a tremendous goalie and he made some big saves as well.”
With the tension at T.D. Garden running high and the boisterous crowd on its feet, Farrell and Northeastern forward Jack Hughes each failed to score in the opening round of the shootout. However, after Levi denied Coronato’s attempt to open the second round, McDonough skated in on Gibson with speed and roofed a wrist shot to put the Huskies one save away from Beanpot glory.
Junior forward Alex Laferriere shot third for Harvard, but Levi was equal to the task again, turning aside Laferriere’s attempt to secure the Beanpot title. As the Huskies and their fans celebrated the program’s fourth Beanpot win in the past five tournaments, a crestfallen Harvard team waited on the ice for the customary postgame handshakes and trophy presentation before returning to the locker room.
“For the last four years, to go to battle every day with my best friends and to have the best coaching staff and the best support staff in the country in my opinion, it means everything,” said McDonough, the Milton, Mass. local. “I told the guys before the game: in the Beanpot it doesn't matter who's on whose team, it comes down to whoever wants it more.”
Despite the heartbreaking defeat, Donato believes that the loss can be a stepping stone for the Crimson as it gears up for the final regular season push, the ECAC tournament, and potentially the NCAA tourney.
“I think it's an incredible opportunity to play in that environment,” Donato said. “I think your whole team grows up to a certain point and I think, once the hurt wears down a little bit, I think it's pretty obvious that we as a group elevated our game…if we want to have success at the end of the year, we're going to have to play in tough environments and play in high stress situations, and I think we’ll look back at this as a real growing opportunity.”
The Crimson return to home ice at Bright-Landry Hockey Center this weekend for a doubleheader against ECAC opponents Union College, 7:00 pm on Friday, and then Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at 7:00 pm on Saturday.

“Oh no! Valentine’s Day is over! Now I have no more seasonal events to look forward to!” That’s me if I cared. No, actually, Valentine’s Day is… fine, but today is even better. Feb. 15 is the only thing that makes Feb. 14 worth getting through, and I’ll tell you why.
Chocolate!
The most obvious great thing about Feb. 15 is that all the chocolate will be discounted. Honestly, I don’t care if chocolate is in the shape of a heart, an egg, or a pumpkin. Chocolate is chocolate, and it’s less expensive than usual on Feb. 15. Catch me storming CVS. I’m stockpiling to last me and my roommate until the day after Easter. (If you’re in charge of regularly providing an org with snacks, take note!)
Drama!
A less hyped but arguably better aspect of today is… the DEBRIEF. Datamatch was yesterday, as was, you know, regular Valentine’s Day stuff. Who broke up? Who got together? Who received the single rose that your section crush brought to class? Did your Datamatch crush roulette work out?!?!
A Welcome Return to Normalcy!
~Society~ is arguably too obsessed with romance as it is, and Valentine’s Day definitely veers into the territory of too much of a good thing. Sometimes you need a moment to relax between special events so you can appreciate the fun times all the more. This is why I’m trying to romanticize a random Wednesday in February.
So let yourself enjoy today, even if it’s not as special as yesterday was. It’s called the present because every day is a gift, etc. etc. Happy Wednesday!
