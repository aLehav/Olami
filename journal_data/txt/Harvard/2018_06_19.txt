After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Medical School professor’s study was terminated Friday after the National Institutes of Health found an inappropriate relationship between researchers and alcohol industry representatives.
The NIH report found “early and frequent engagement” between liquor companies, researchers, and employees of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which “calls into question the impartiality of the process.”
“Interactions among several NIAAA staff and industry representatives appear to intentionally bias the framing of the scientific premise in the direction of demonstrating a beneficial health effect of moderate alcohol consumption,” the report stated.
Heavily redacted emails included in the report show that researchers extensively contacted alcohol executives and frequently promised positive results in an attempt to secure funding for their project. In one, a researcher referred to the the study staff as “team health benefits of drinking.”
Officially titled the Moderate Alcohol and Cardiovascular Health trial, or MACH 15, the study was led by Kenneth J. Mukamal, an associate professor at the Medical School.
In an emailed statement, Mukamal wrote that he believes its design was appropriate.
“As investigators, we stand fully and forcefully behind the scientific integrity of the MACH15 trial protocol and team,” he wrote. “We are deeply disappointed that issues raised have led to a recommendation to end the trial.”
“We strongly believe that MACH15 has a critically important scientific premise, rigorous design, and highly-qualified team and represents the best and perhaps only opportunity ever to gain clear answers to these important questions,” Mukamal wrote.
Mukamal based the study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he is a doctor. Jennifer Kritz, a Beth Israel spokesperson, wrote in an email that the hospital takes the NIH’s decision “very seriously” and “will review the report carefully.”
The termination comes after the NIH suspended enrollment in the study last month as it conducted its investigations, prompted by media reports about the researchers’ meetings with alcohol company representatives.
Researchers initially wanted to enroll about 7,800 study participants, who would be randomly assigned to either drink once a day or not at all for six years, according to the MACH 15 study website.
Mukamal and his colleagues pitched the study to alcohol industry groups at high-end hotels, telling them the study “represents a unique opportunity to show that moderate alcohol consumption is safe and lowers risk of common diseases,” the New York Times reported in March.
The NIH’s Advisory Committee to the Director published the results of that investigation, Friday. It detailed interactions between industry groups and study organizers, which lasted between September 2013 and February 2015.
The NIH report also identified methodological flaws in the study, such as the study having “not enough patients and not enough follow-up time” to assess both the harms and benefits of alcohol use.
Michael B. Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, wrote in an email that he agreed with the NIH’s decision because the report “reveals numerous serious scientific and ethical breaches that fatally compromise the integrity of the research.”
“The problem is that the principal investigator in this case was not transparent and hid the fact that he was soliciting money from the industry and essentially promising them positive results,” Siegel added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hundreds of documents released Friday in the ongoing admissions lawsuit against Harvard will likely fail to prove the College discriminates against Asian American applicants but could still hurt Harvard’s chance of winning in court, according to several legal experts.
The lawsuit, filed in 2014 by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian American students seeking admittance to the College, a charge the University has repeatedly denied. Both Harvard and SFFA posted documents last week in an attempt to convince Judge Allison D. Burroughs to decide the case early in their respective favors.
A portion of the papers released last week reveal Harvard conducted a confidential internal review of its admissions process in late 2012 and early 2013, ultimately concluding its policies produce “negative effects” for Asian American applicants. Asian American “high achievers” saw lower rates of admission and consistently earned poorer “personal” ratings form admissions officers despite earning high rankings for their academic records and test scores, per the Harvard review, conducted by the University’s Office of Institutional Research.
Savannah Law School associate professor Vinay Harpalani, who said he supports the use of affirmative action in college admissions, said some documents published Friday disclose what he called Harvard’s “problematic behavior” toward Asian Americans.
“I'd be surprised if SFFA were able to prove intentional discrimination against Asian Americans,” Harpalani said. “But by making Harvard release all this information, it would at least strengthen the other part of their case that Harvard is using race in unconstitutional ways.”
Roger Clegg, the President and General Counsel for the Center of Equal Opportunity, said he believes the internal study comprises “particularly strong” evidence against the University.
“This was something, other than simply the statistical evidence that I knew the plaintiffs would be able to discover, this was something in addition to that that I think was very damning of Harvard, very helpful to the plaintiffs,” Clegg said.
But Kimberly West-Faulcon, a former civil rights attorney who has litigated cases centered on race discrimination in higher education, said the statistical analyses included in Friday’s filings are more compelling than the internal report.
SFFA filed two studies on Harvard’s use of race in admissions, one authored by Duke University professor Peter S. Arcidiacono and one authored by senior fellow at The Century Foundation Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85. Harvard hired its own expert, University of California, Berkeley professor David E. Card, to analyze Arcidiacono’s and Kahlenberg’s reports.
“I think it will boil down to, as folks often say, the battle of the experts and whether the court thinks that what the experts have presented so far is sufficient to really resolve that battle,” West-Faulcon said. “If the judge thinks one experts has very much more convincingly and credibly relied on the data and is convinced of that, the judge could very well decide that this is enough to be done with this.”
West-Faulcon said the expert reports would likely be more relevant than the internal Harvard review moving forward because “the conclusions in those are much more thorough.” In its own filings, Harvard wrote the OIR reports were “incomplete, preliminary, and based on limited inputs.”
Despite SFFA’s arguments, experts said it is unlikely the case will be settled without a trial. Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court in Boston previously indicated an early settlement is unlikely.
“I think it's going to be difficult for this case to be resolved on summary judgement,” Harpalani said. “I don't think SSFA has shown intentional discrimination or would win on a summary judgement posing on intentional discrimination.”
Harpalani added SFFA’s claims of intentional discrimination demand a “very high standard” of proof.
“These are rarely summary judgement type cases,” said Mishell B. Kneeland, former Assistant Attorney General of Texas and one of the lawyers representing University of Texas in the 2016 Fisher v. UT-Austin affirmative action case.
Clegg said he believes that summary judgement would be “appropriate” as the plaintiffs have made “as persuasive a case as one could imagine.” He added, however, that—due to the high-profile nature of the case—summary judgement would be unlikely.
“The standard for winning a case on a motion for summary judgment is difficult for anyone and speaking in a case like this, which is so high-profile where it's being litigated with very good lawyers on both sides and a lot of the evidence is disputed, one would have to predict that the judge would probably give both sides, literally, their day in court,” Clegg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Harvard made admissions decisions based only on applicants’ academic qualifications, more than 51 percent of the average admitted class would be Asian-American, according to court documents filed by an anti-affirmative action group Friday.
The filings, submitted by Students for Fair Admissions, mark the latest development in a lawsuit the group brought against Harvard in Nov. 2014 alleging the school’s admissions process discriminates against Asian Americans. The documents reveal previously unknown details of the College’s secretive admissions system.
SFFA’s filings include the findings of Duke Professor of Economics Peter S. Arcidiacono, who analyzed students’ racial makeup in each academic decile to conclude the number of Asian-American admits to the College would “increase significantly” if Harvard’s admissions officers considered only took standardized test scores and high school grades. SFFA’s documents also state Asian-American applicants typically garner higher academic and extracurricular ratings than do candidates of other races.
Harvard’s own filings assert applicants must have more than purely academic qualifications to gain admission to the College.
“To be admitted to Harvard, applicants must have multiple areas of strength in addition to being academically qualified,” the filings read.
Harvard hopefuls are assigned ratings from 1 to 6 in approximately 14 categories including academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, athletic prowess, strength of character, up to four teacher recommendations, counselor recommendations, a “personal” and “overall” rating by staff, and a “personal” and “overall” rating by an alumnus, according to documents filed by SFFA. A “1” represents the highest score an applicant can receive; “6” marks the lowest.
Admissions officers can use a plus to indicate that an applicant is slightly stronger than the numerical score they receive, while a minus denotes the opposite.
Sixty percent of Asian-American applicants garner academic ratings higher than 3+, compared to 45 percent of white applicants, according to SFFA’s filings. Twenty-eight percent of Asian-American Harvard hopefuls receive a 2 or higher on their extracurricular rating, compared to 24 percent of white candidates. And Asian-Americans boast the lowest fraction of applicants that receive an overall rating worse than 3.
SFFA argues this means “Asian Americans are stronger overall than other racial groups.”
“The share of Asian Americans who receive a 2 or better in the overall rating is lower than that of both white and African-American applicants,” SFFA filings state. Nonetheless, the admissions rate for white applicants is 3.5 percentage points higher than that for Asian-American applicants, according to SFFA documents.
Arcidiacono concluded that “Asian-American applicants suffer a statistically significant penalty relative to white applicants” in the personal and overall ratings.
But Harvard’s expert, Berkeley Professor David Card, argued in his analysis that “the purported ‘penalty against Asian Americans’ identified by Prof. Arcidiacono does not actually exist.”
The two experts’ disagreement stems from the different models they used to calculate the likelihood that Asian-American applicants will be admitted to the College. Card included legacy students and athletes in his model; Arcidiacono did not.
The University first unearthed data indicating Asian-American applicants tend to earn comparatively higher academic rankings several years ago. A 2013 internal Harvard report found Asian American applicants performed significantly better on test scores, academics, and overall scores from alumni interviews. Of 10 total characteristics, white students performed significantly better in only one—rankings of personal qualities assigned by the Admissions Office.
In the University’s recent court filings, Harvard called the 2013 report inconclusive and incomplete. One of the documents the University submitted describes the “personal rating” as a score evaluating the applicant’s personal qualities including “essays, letters of recommendation, the alumni interview report, personal and family hardship,” and characteristics like “grit” and “humor.”
“Admissions officers do not take race into account when assigning the personal rating” or academic, extracurricular, and athletic scores, according to the document submitted by the University.
The document further asserts race is not a determining factor in the admissions process. Harvard’s filings do not present different admissions data from SFFA’s; however, experts representing each side have offered dueling opinions as to whether past data evinces a pattern of discrimination.
“Race alone does not determine whether or not an applicant is admitted, and numerous other characteristics of applicants are much better predictors of Harvard’s admissions decisions,” Harvard’s filings read.
Even though Friday’s filings produced some previously unknown statistics about Harvard admissions, the vast majority of admissions data will remain confidential unless the lawsuit goes to trial.
Both Harvard and SFFA hope to convince the judge to throw out the case before it goes to trial, though experts—and the judge herself—have said this outcome is unlikely.
