After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a full day of racing on Saturday for the men of Harvard rowing. The heavyweight crew headed down to Philadelphia and came out victorious against the University of Pennsylvania and Navy. The lightweights had a tougher time stroking past its competitors on the Charles, coming in second place against Princeton and Yale.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Crimson had a strong performance in the Adams cup down in Philadelphia on Saturday, coming in first place for the first and second varsity boats by roughly a two-second margin in each race.
“Coming into this weekend, we knew both Penn and Navy would be strong,” captain Andrew Holmes said. “So we were anticipating some very tough racing.”
Harvard raced three varsity and two novice boats and came away with three first-place finishes. The first varsity finished with a time of five minutes, 34.6 seconds, the second varsity with a time of 5:44.8, and the first novice boat with a time of 5:35.5.
“Our freshmen had one of their best performances of the season and blew away their opposition to win by more than 15 seconds,” Holmes said.
The Naval Academy took the other two races, finishing on top in the third varsity with a time of 5:45.8, a full six seconds ahead of the Crimson, and placed first in the second novice boat, which was Harvard’s only last-place finish of the day.
“Navy is always the most physical opponent that we face, and Penn have been gaining speed all season,” Holmes said. “To come away with wins in the Freshmen, 2V and 1V races was a great result for us.”
The first place finish down on the Schuylkill River marked the 15th consecutive win of the Adams Cup for the Crimson.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The lightweight crew hosted two major Ivy League competitors on the Charles this weekend. Harvard finished in between Princeton and Yale, with the Tigers taking the victory and going home with the Vogal Cup.
“The HYP regatta is always a very intense and exciting weekend of racing,” captain Zander Bonorris said. “[We’re] all typically powerhouses in lightweight rowing, and so to have all three of those teams together in Newell Boathouse is exciting, and you can tell that the pressure is on.”
In first varsity, Yale finished a fraction of a second behind Princeton, which had a time of 5:49.7. The Tigers finished with large margins of victory in its other first-place races—second and third varsity and second novice.
“I was very impressed with Princeton’s depth this year, from the top boat to the third varsity,” Bonorris said.
The Tigers took home 33 points while the Crimson finished up with 27 and the Bulldogs from New Haven caught 19.
“I expected our boats to come out with aggression and intensity, considering the heightened competitive spirit at this regatta, and that would definitely be an accurate summary of the racing,” Bonorris said.
Harvard’s strongest performance was in the first novice boat, which finished with a time of 5:56.3, three seconds ahead of Yale.
The Crimson came in third place for the first varsity, several seconds behind its competitors with a time of 5:55.8. The crew came in last two other times, in third varsity with a time of 6:10.3, seven seconds behind the Tigers, and in second novice with a time of 6:36.4, over 12 seconds behind Yale and Princeton.
“We were expecting some ferocious competition this weekend, and we definitely got that,” Bonorris said. “The Harvard boats fought hard, and while we fell short this weekend, we are always looking to improve and gain more speed in the next three weeks.”
The Crimson has a little break before the EARC Sprints.
“For most of the team, Sprints will be the last race of the season,” Bonorris said. “This race was a good experience to have because we were able to test our speed against some of the fastest boats in the league.”
Using this weekend’s setback, Harvard has an opportunity to motivate its crew to improve before the EARC Sprints.
“While we might not have gotten the results that we wanted, I think that the feeling on the team is that if we put our heads down, and grind for three weeks, that we can come out of it stronger and faster, and that we can show some more speed at Sprints,” Bonorris said.
“Every race is another opportunity to find out something more about oneself, to improve boatspeed, and to become a better racer,” she added. “The racing from the Crimson showed this attitude and determination to improve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it heads into the last lap of the regular season, the Harvard track and field team has certainly not slowed down. Competing across the country this weekend, the team posted several personal bests and beat old Harvard records.
Penn Relays
Senior Morgan Kelly had another standout weekend as she broke the Crimson record in the 3k race with a time of 9:21.42. Kelly broke the 5k record last week, which had been set Katie Wylie '85 in 1983. Claire Richardson '11 was the previous holder of the 3k record, which she broke in 2010, but Kelly’s mark surpassed Richardson by just under two seconds. Kelly finished sixth overall against the rest of the field at the Philadelphia, Penn. meet that attracts competition from around the globe.
Two of the squad’s relay teams also claimed top spots in the record books.
The 4x400 relay finished in a time of 3:36.83 to overtake the record set a year ago. Running in the relay were sophomore Autumne Franklin, freshman Jade Miller, freshman Jackie Modesett, and junior Gabrielle Scott. Franklin and Scott both were members of the group that set the old record at last year’s ECAC meet with a time of 3:37.90. This year’s time put them in third place in the meet.
The distance medley relay also set a new record with an 8th place finish. The group consisting of sophomore Kieran Gallagher, senior Olivia Abbate, and juniors Erika Veidis and Molly Renfer finished in 11:18.59.
Skyhawk Invite 
In a local competition at Stonehill College, the men finished fourth overall and the women finished seventh despite sending small squads.
The 5k was one of Harvard’s strongest events on the day, with two runners finishing in the top five. Sophomore Johnny Marvin clocked in at 15:07.71 to claim the top spot, while junior teammate Ryan Meehan finished just behind him in the fourth spot with a time of 15:29.75.
In the field events, senior Alysha Johnson excelled for the women with her personal best this season in the shot put to top the podium. For the men, freshman Julian Nunally had a strong day with a second place finish in the shot put and third in the discus.
UCSD Triton Invitational
The women’s throwing team headed to the West Coast to compete this weekend at the UCSD Triton Invitation.
Freshman Nikki Okwelogu continued her strong rookie season by breaking the Crimson record in the discus with a throw of 51.14 meters. Catherine Griffin '92, held the previous record with a distance of 51.09m. Okwelogu’s throw was good enough for seventh overall at the meet.
“I’ve always been a competition thrower,” Okwelogu said. “I thrive off the nervous adrenaline. Plus these were all the people I competed against in high school, and it was nice to see that kind of competition again. They push me to be better. [It’s] higher stakes, no one wants to be last.”
Though she has posted strong marks this season, Okwelogu still feels she has room to grow.
“The school record has never crossed my mind,” Okewelogu said. “I have so many goals for this season and somehow that wasn’t one of them. I’ve just wanted t throw farther than I did last year and qualify for as many post season meets as I can. I still haven’t PR-ed in discus though. I’m holding out for it.”
Senior Adabelle Ekechukwu earned the second best distance of her college career in the hammer throw with a distance of 57.16m to place 11th in the meet.
OTC Elite Invitational
The men’s throwing squad also headed west to compete this weekend, and junior Igor Liokumovich had arguably the best weekend of his career. The Rosewood, Ill. native set three personal records during the meet.
In the discus, Liokumovich beat his previous best by two meters with a distance of 54.51m. The junior had two personal bests in the shot, first beating his own previous distance with a throw of 17.57m, and then beating himself again with a throw of 17.76m. His second throw claimed the top spot in the event.
Junior Ben Glauser also had a successful weekend, with an 11th-place finish in the hammer throw and sixth-place finish in the shot put.
Harvard will not compete next weekend in order to prepare for the upcoming championship season.
“All year long we’re building for the championship push of our season,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “So it’s kind of [important to] continue to gain momentum, continue to build towards that competitive window of competing at the highest level possible. I’m thrilled with the progression so many of our student athlete’s are making.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While admitted students were exploring the campus for Visitas, this past weekend also served as a fall preview for the Harvard football team. On Saturday night, the Crimson took the field at Harvard Stadium in organized fashion for the first time since November to play its annual Spring Game.
As the Crimson lost more than thirty members of the Class of 2014 to graduation, the intra-squad scrimmage represented an opportunity for less experienced players to show what they could do. But perhaps most importantly, Saturday provided a broad look at the current state of the Harvard football program, which is coming off a 2013 Ivy League co-championship. Here are five takeaways from the Spring Game.
The Crimson’s defensive line looks strong. Despite the graduation of several standout pass rushers, defenders forced their way through the offensive line to register sacks and create pressure throughout the scrimmage. Rising senior Zach Hodges, the 2013 Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, is sure to draw consistent double-teams, opening things up for classmate Obum Obukwelu and rising junior Dan Moody on the other side of the line.
Harvard has depth at wide receiver. A number of receivers stepped up to make catches Saturday night. Perhaps the best news for Harvard is that senior Ricky Zorn, who sat out his freshman year due to injury, will be returning to the team this coming fall. The team’s leading receiver in 2013, Zorn will be complemented by rising junior Andrew Fischer and rising seniors Ryan Simpson and Tyler Hamblin. Another standout from Saturday was rising sophomore Anthony Firkser, who reeled in several long passes.
The team should be solid once more at quarterback. Rising senior and returning starter Connor Hempel looked good on Saturday, threading the needle with several passes and tossing a pair of touchdowns. Rising sophomore Joseph Viviano III will likely represent a threat at backup quarterback, as Viviano showcased his speed and quick plants while rushing for two touchdowns in the scrimmage.
Special teams will need to be cleaned up. Admittedly, things get confusing in the Spring Game, with players from different teams often suiting up on the same unit for punts, kickoffs, and field goals. But things appeared sloppy at times as rising senior Andrew Flesher missed an extra point, and punts fell short of their intended distance several times.
As usual, Harvard will have options out of the backfield. Rising junior Paul Stanton burst onto the scene in his sophomore campaign and will look to build on his success this fall. Stanton did not receive much work in the Spring Game, but rising seniors Seitu Smith II and Andrew Casten contributed some solid runs of their own, each scoring a touchdown while Smith ran for 85 yards on 14 carries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering its first USA Rugby Division I National Championships as a varsity squad, the Harvard women’s rugby team (7-6) looked compete against the country’s top teams in the Sweet Sixteen. The Crimson—which had lost several key starters throughout the spring season to injuries—hoped to use its late-season momentum from a win against the professional Beantown Rugby squad as it faced some of its stiffest competition yet this year.
“I think people felt really good [physically and mentally] going in,” co-captain Ali Haber said. “We had two of our captains out for the rest of the season [as well as] a couple other key players, but we had all the minor [injuries] cleared up in time for this. It was a pretty positive feeling going into this weekend.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, its inaugural varsity season came to an end over the weekend, as a first-round loss to North Carolina and a consolation defeat against Indiana ended its post-season run.
INDIANA 29, HARVARD 24
 
Playing its last match of its 2013-2014 campaign, the Crimson put it all out on the line in a consolation match against the Hoosiers.
“We came in a lot stronger,” Haber said. “The mentality was a lot better in this game.”
A try by senior Cayla Calderwood and conversion by classmate Shelby Lin put Harvard up, 7-0, out of the gates. Juniors Cheta Emba and Kaleigh Henry added tries of their own to give the Crimson a 19-0 lead heading into halftime.
But Indiana rallied back in the final 40 minutes of play, regaining momentum after Harvard pushed the score to 24-7. The Hoosiers scored five-straight unanswered tries to take the lead, with Harvard unable to answer with its own offensive strikes.
“We kind of let our guard down in the last few minutes of the game,” Haber said. “That’s what the score ended up reflecting, but we fought really hard in that game, and it was a good turn-around in terms of effort and mentality from the day before.”
 
NORTH CAROLINA 29, HARVARD 15
 
Harvard had a tough start to its first-round matchup against the Tar Heels.
“The first five or ten minutes were completely on defense, which is a tough way to start out a game,” Haber said. “We fought really hard.”
UNC got an early try, but Calderwood added a score for the Crimson to tie the game up at five apiece.
Emba added another score to give Harvard its only lead of the contest, 10-5
“We had momentum going in the right direction,” Haber said. “It was a really good showing out of the gate, and it kind of just fell off a bit. I guess it was a defensive lapse for the most part after that. Through the middle of the game, we let them get a couple too many in.”
The Tar Heels rallied with four-straight unanswered tries to take a 29-10 lead in the second frame, but the Crimson responded, as Lin added a score to close the deficit.
“We definitely picked it up in the second half, but it was too late to recover the score,” Haber said.
Despite a late push, Harvard ultimately failed to score any more tries, and the final score stood at 29-15, knocking the Crimson out of the championship bracket.

The end of the semester is rapidly approaching, and that means several things. Time to solidify your date to Fête, time to actually start freaking out about what you’re doing this summer (and—for those who have that one all figured out—where you’re living), it’s time to answer the question weighing on everyone’s minds: “primal scream or nah.” Engaging in the time-honored Harvard ritual in the spring has its benefits, and here are several reasons why spring primal scream is totally better than winter primal scream.
 
It’s not in the winter—the primal scream Wikipedia article notes that primal scream is “done…even during New England winters.” This is Wikipedia-worthy because New England winters are remarkably cold. The degree of this is literally worth remarking upon. Running around the Yard naked in the spring is guaranteed to be a much more enjoyable experience, and for dudes in particular spring primal scream can be seen as a growing experience. Although it does take away that clutch cold weather scapegoat.
 
It’s in the spring—spring primal scream is not only not in the winter, but it also happens to be in the spring. This means that if you get tired while taking your lap, you can sit in those colorful chairs they scatter throughout the Yard in the springtime. Furthermore, more tourists come to Harvard in the spring, so you will be able to proudly strut your stuff in front of a wider audience. And while one might be tempted to associate spring with allergies, winter takes the cake when it comes to sneezing, given the fact that people often associate “winter” with “cold.”
 
Fewer people—for some reason, spring primal scream is way less crowded than winter primal scream. This has its obvious advantages. People you know probably won’t be doing it, so you don’t have to fear a friend—or worse, a crush—seeing you in your birthday suit. It also means you have less competition, which is particularly a boon if you suffer from low self-esteem.
 
Different crowd—winter primal scream is sometimes referred to as “freshman primal scream,” as it is often characterized by first-years trying to knock out one of the Big Three. People who do it in the spring are normally either really dedicated screamers (as in, they do it every semester) or senior springers taking advantage of their last chance to do run around Harvard Yard naked on the day before finals week. Plus you will only be able to know which primal scream is better after participating in both. 
 
New perspective—it’s May. You’ve been doing school for the last nine months. You hate everyone. You just want everyone to go away. Well, unfortunately you still have to wait a couple more weeks before all the friends you’re so sick of disappear from your life. But, at least running in the spring primal scream gives you the chance to see people from a new perspective. It is certainly one way to spice up what has become your rote, repetitive, and mundane Harvard existence.

Over the summer, some students will have internships with leading innovators, like SpaceX or Facebook. Some will take on world-changing service projects. Others will work to save up for the busy school year. Others yet will… well… not be doing such amazing, life-changing things. Here’s a guide to describing your not-so-thrilling summer plans.
Watching Netflix
“I’m actually going conducting a pretty intense visual media study. I’m really excited about exploring the connection between technology and the arts, so I think I’m going to be spending a lot of time really diving into that.”
Babysitting
“I’ve always been really interested in early-childhood education. I really just want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how kids think about things. I mean, I’m not really doing any kind of formal program, but honestly that’s just because I really want to have first hand experience and not get tangled up in any bureaucracy."
 Partying
“My plans are still a little up in the air, but I think I might do some kind of sociological research. Maybe some kind of independent study on human social interactions. The most important thing is to really immerse myself completely in whatever cultural zone I am experiencing, right?”
 Eating Nachos
“Dude! I’m doing a crazy culinary immersion project. It’s going to be sickkkk!” (It will, indeed, be “sickkkk” if you use spray cheese.)
