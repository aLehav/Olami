After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concert pianist Sara Davis Buechner has been lauded by the New York Times for her “intelligence, integrity and all-encompassing technical prowess.” She currently serves on the piano faculty of Temple University and recently performed for the Longwood Symphony Orchestra at the New England Conservatory.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get into music?
Sara Davis Buechner: I grew up in a house in Baltimore, where my parents were very poor. But my mother was very committed to my brother and I getting a good education and a very profound exposure to culture which she had been denied herself. We had a lot of good books in the house and piano lessons, and she used to take out these framed reproductions of masterpieces from the neighborhood library. She hung these all around the house. So I was surrounded by copies of Gauguin and Renoir.
When I was a teenager, we would visit Washington and we'd always go to the art museums, especially the National Gallery. And I figured early on that the colors in those paintings were a visual representation of the colors I was trying to make in music.
THC: Do you think that the art that we call “great” needs to be “good?”
SDB: I was quite inspired in reading the obituaries one day, which I do religiously. I'm guessing this is a good 15 to 20 years ago now, there was a conductor named Franz Allers. I was surprised he had a pretty sizable obit at the time, but I'd never heard of him. They went on to describe that he was a German or Austrian musician who, like many others, had emigrated to the United States during World War II to escape with his life for being Jewish. And when he got to New York, he just couldn't get much employment and he ended up conducting a lot of Broadway pit orchestras. He conducted most of the great Lerner-Loewe musicals that we know, like “My Fair Lady.” And he was asked that question, and he said, “there is no first and second rate music, there are only first and second rate performances.”
THC: Why do you read the obituaries every day?
SDB: I guess I could say, sadly, that I probably formed that habit in the early 1980s when I lived in New York City. It was right after I had gotten out of Juilliard and played the New York debut, and I'm starting my performance career. At that time, I was associated with the Baldwin piano. Now the Baldwin Piano Company has since gone out of business, sad to say. After Baldwin went under, I started to play the Yamaha piano, and I'm still a Yamaha artist. Many pianists don't have a piano affiliation, they just play anything they like. If you have an affiliation with a piano company, then you try to play that piano whenever you can.
There was a wonderful man who ran the artists’ relations department of Baldwin named Jack Romano. Jack was beloved by everybody in the business — he was a delightful, charming man. He was in his mid 50s, at that time, I think, with a model's red hair and an appetite for drink and other otherworldly exaltations. He would have bridge parties, and he had the great jazz pianist George Shearing come over. George Shearing was blind — he wore dark glasses. He'd always say to George, "God dammit, stop peeking at my cards!" I just adored Jack. Everybody did. And one day my manager called me and said, “I want you to take some time to go see Jack. He's in the hospital.”
And I said, "What's wrong?" He says, "Well, nobody really knows. But you know, he'll be okay. He’ll be out soon." I went to see him and indeed, Jack didn't know what was wrong with him. Doctors wouldn't tell him much, and Jack stayed in that hospital and he got sicker and sicker and sicker. And I've never forgotten — I think it was the last time I saw him. I went to the hospital. His eyes were closed. He was hardly communicative. I asked him, was there anything I could do from him? He said, "Can you please give me a shave? The nurses won't shave me." Oh, okay. Sure. So, I took a straight razor and I gave him a shave and of course, I nicked him one or two places and wiped the blood off and when I got home, I had a panic attack because people were talking about this funny disease that was transmitted in blood.
I called the gay men's health crisis center to talk to someone who soothed me and said, “Look, wash your hands. Get yourself tested in a few weeks; don't panic, it'll probably be okay.” And, of course, Jack was one of the first people I knew who died of AIDS.
Around that time, in early 1980s, I think I developed that habit of looking at obituaries because first it was once a month, you'd hear that this pianist died or that composer died or this dancer died. And then it was once a week, then almost daily. You’d pick up the New York Times and there would be some young creative person dead and then it was a 21-year-old classmate of mine from Juilliard. It was horrifying. And the Reagan administration, like the Trump administration, was so ignorant of medicine; They wouldn't do anything. Nobody seemed to care.
THC: I’m kind of curious — if you had to write your own obituary, what would the first sentence be?
SDB: Oh my god. I would write, “Sara Davis, the greatest pianist of all time.”
I'm not gonna answer that question. Somebody else has got to do it, right?
What I don't want it to say is “transgender pianist,” and I'm almost certain that the New York Times, if and when I pass away, will say, “Sara Davis Buechner, transgender pianist, died at age,” you know, whatever. It's not because I'm at all unhappy with that title. It's just that I hope by the time I die, that being trans is something that is fully just known and accepted and not spectacular. I think the word may have to be part of my obit because I guess I was a pioneer in terms of just being out about that. Being very open about my transition. So that's okay. I mean, I'm proud of that, to have inspired a lot of young people to come backstage and say, "you gave me a little courage" or "I was inspired by your story."
But my whole life, ever since I was a little kid, has always been about playing Mozart. I'd be less than honest if I didn't say there's a little bit of anger deep inside me. I still cope with it every day — having to prove myself not just once or twice or three times in my life, but many, many times over because, you know, people either couldn't cope with that or are baffled by it. When I went off to Boston, I hadn't been to Boston in many, many years. I saw some people who I'd known who I hadn't seen in 20 years. They hadn’t seen me as a female before. They got right back into the swing of calling me the wrong name, the wrong pronouns and everything until I caught them.
It's very confusing, probably. But I feel like you've had 20 years to practice this. What's so damn tough about it? So you realize you're still fighting something and standing up for something that maybe most people don't encounter in their life. I'm sure they don't mean anything malevolent for the most part.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a world in which crime shows like “Law and Order: SVU” and “True Detective” place the emphasis on the detectives solving a case, Netflix’s new film “Lost Girls,” about young women who go missing in Long Island, comes as a surprise. This moody biopic, helmed by Academy Award winning director Liz Garbus, admirably strives to humanize the victims of tragedy and analyze the dynamics of their families following the events.
“Lost Girls” tells the true story of single mother of three, Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan), who struggled to find her eldest daughter, 24-year-old sex worker Shannan Gilbert, after she went missing in 2010. Shannan was raised in foster care following a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 12, a decision her mother made because she could not afford to provide Shannan with the care she needed. Years later, Shannan is still the apple of her mother’s eye and her disappearance prompts Mari to take the investigation into her own hands. Mari’s inquiries help police to uncover a string of other grisly murders of sex workers in their sleepy part of town.
Though the media loves nothing more than a missing young girl, the disappearance of a sex worker never has quite the same effect — or so “Lost Girls” thoughtfully proposes early in its arc. The film criticizes the disparity in police action in cases involving sex workers and those of victims of more conventional professions. Emphasizing this injustice helps anchor the overall plot.
In most criminal narrative adaptations, the victims tend to be sensationalized and their behaviors scrutinized with an almost Freudian insistence. Wild theories are cast out like nets, searching desperately for justifications about the victims’ occupations or private decisions. The question is never “how will the crime be solved,” but rather “what about this woman's history led her to being a victim?”
While “Lost Girls” provides reasons for why Shannan became a sex worker, Garbus is uninterested in diagnosing her relationships or passing judgement. Instead, she brings insight into Shannan’s and the other girls’ lives, giving them personalities through the families they leave behind.
Garbus forgoes placing any blame on the victim's families. It is too easy to say that, had she not been a sex worker, Shannan might not have disappeared the way she did. We could then point to Mari’s decision to place her in foster care as the trigger that set off this chain of events. Yet Garbus presents information in context, showing that Mari’s actions were based on a selfless desire to provide her daughter with more help than she could afford.
Most of the film’s rage comes in the form of Ryan’s formidable acting. At the beginning, Ryan portrays Mari as a shell of a woman, living in the past and perpetually distracted by financial trouble. Early shots depict her splitting her time between working jobs to support her girls and reminiscing over childhood videos of Shannan. Though clearly a devoted mother, Mari’s struggles divert her attention from her other children Sherre (Thomasin McKenzie) and Sarah (Oona Laurence).
After Shannan’s disappearance, Mari turns into a bold fighter, ready to take any course of action to get answers. Courtesy of Ryan’s talent, her character’s transition to justifiable viciousness is seamless. Ryan imbues Mari with a tangible desperation and clawing strength. At the end of the film, real press conference footage of Mari confirms that her obstinance is carefully translated to the screen.
Heavy emotional moments in the film are often buoyed by a talented ensemble of young actors who provide empathetic performances of the victims’ families. In one incredibly touching scene, family members of the missing women go around in a circle and share memories about their lost ones. Sherre speaks proudly about Shannan’s intellectual accomplishments, and the other womens’ encouraging responses seal their growing bond. The heartbreak and sweetness of McKenzie’s performance, as well as those of the other actors, reminds us that this drama is not just about police accountability, but also the emotional consequences at stake.
The film’s cinematography also deserves praise. Igor Martinovic is not afraid to bring even more darkness to a bleak film through his vivid, lingering shots and largely blue-tinged tone. It works perfectly with a lugubrious soundtrack that recycles bars from a cover of Stephen Foster’s “Beautiful Dreamer.” The eerie song becomes a clear motif, a yearning tune to match the film’s somber mood and represent the crushed potential of every missing young woman.
In spite of the film’s relatively short length, the slow development of the plot and the myriad of injustices make “Lost Girls” a slow burn that’s occasionally difficult to watch. Its abrupt ending appears to be purposefully unsatisfactory, perhaps to remind the viewer that this is an unsolved crime. But this adjective does not apply to the rest of the fim. There is something deeply satisfying in having its conclusions come to the spotlight. "Lost Girls" carries a sense of urgency that demands it to be watched.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether or not you believe T.S. Eliot’s claim that “April is the cruellest month,” one thing is for certain: Artists’ fascination with spring shows no signs of changing with the seasons. The ten songs in this playlist capture springtime in all its vibrant, unpredictable glory, so give them a listen for an auditory burst of fresh air.
“Hazy Shade of Winter” by Gerard Way feat. Ray Toro
Why should a song titled “Hazy Shade of Winter” kick off a playlist about spring, you ask? The narrator won’t let his barren surroundings get in the way of the “springtime of [his] life.” Way and Toro spice up Simon and Garfunkel’s folksy tune with the glam-rock sensibilities they perfected as members of My Chemical Romance.
“Nine in the Afternoon” by Panic! at the Disco
The lead single of Panic’s 2008 album “Pretty. Odd.” celebrates the best spring has to offer with its carefree exuberance and embrace of the bizarre. For even more seasonal spirit, watch the band wander through a kaleidoscopic world strewn with sunflowers and pastel hues in the accompanying Video Music Award-nominated music video.
“First Love/Late Spring” by Mitski
“I felt like I was in love for the first time when I was writing that song,” Mitski said of this guitar-heavy rock ballad. In the chorus, she begs for a reprieve from the overwhelming emotions of first love — which, like spring, brings uncertainty and upheaval along with its fragile beauty.
“Both Sides Now” by Judy Collins
Collins’ rich, soaring voice brings Joni Mitchell’s evocative lyrics to life in this ’60s hit about finding perspective through change. With shifting imagery as capricious as spring weather, “Both Sides Now” radiates joy even in the face of the unknown.
“RAIN” by Ben Platt
Upbeat, fun, and utterly danceable, Platt’s recent single is sure to bring pep to the dreariest of spring downpours. “I hope it brings you dance and catharsis,” he tweeted after its release. “May I suggest you blast it.” His advice is well worth following.
“Here Comes the Sun” by The Beatles
Just over three minutes of pure sonic sunshine: This Beatles classic needs no introduction, but no springtime playlist would be complete without it.
“The Ice Is Getting Thinner” by Death Cab for Cutie
Leave it to Death Cab to use a thinning ice sheet as a metaphor for a relationship that melts with the first rays of spring sunlight. “The seasons have changed and so have we,” the narrator admits.
“Flower Moon” by Vampire Weekend feat. Steve Lacy
With its delicately layered and distorted vocals, “Flower Moon” blossoms out of a choral opening into a refrain laden with uneasy symbolism. The lyrics draw on the moon’s traditional association with fortune and spirituality, portraying the May full moon as both cursed and sacred.
“Pieces of April” by Three Dog Night
This understated, nostalgic track pays tribute to the preservation of cherished memories, no matter how fleeting. The chorus says it all: “I’ve got pieces of April / I keep ’em in a memory bouquet / I’ve got pieces of April / But it’s a morning in May.”
“Simple Gifts” from “Appalachian Spring” by Aaron Copland
Looking for something to thaw the frozen recesses of your heart? Keep things “simple” and listen to this beautiful excerpt from Copland’s pastoral ballet, which helped bring the now-ubiquitous Shaker hymn into the public eye. Like spring itself, it’s a gift that keeps on giving year after year.

As a History concentrator, I’m embarrassed to admit that two months ago I didn’t know that the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 had even existed. But the current pandemic has propelled this footnote of history into the limelight. As crises arise, it is perfectly natural that we scramble to find precedents. We need to learn from the past to fix the present. It can also be therapeutic to know that we’ve survived something like this before.
However, the Spanish flu is not an adequate precedent for the coronavirus. I believe the same time period offers us a better alternative: World War I. The Great War has many lessons to teach us as we navigate the Great Pandemic.
Both World War I and this pandemic were unprecedented. This past February, newspaper headlines often referenced the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Similarly, in July 1914, as Austria-Hungary and Serbia went to war, Europeans hearkened back to the Crimean War of the 1850s and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. But, as the rest of Europe spiraled into total warfare in August 1914, it became clear that these short, restricted conflicts were not adequate precedents for the carnage to come. So too, have we already dismissed SARS and Ebola as too limited to serve as historical precedents for our current global pandemic.
Precedent seekers in 1914 were forced to turn back more than a century to the Napoleonic Wars to examine what total war on the continent would look like. However, much had changed between 1814 and 1914 — the spread of nationalism and colonialism, the invention of machine guns and mortars, and the emancipation of Russian serfs. These developments led to many unanticipated consequences on the battlefield.
We too have to look back over a century to find a pathogen as global, transmissible, and deadly as the current coronavirus. But just as the Napoleonic Wars could not prepare the masses in 1914 for the horrors of World War I, the Spanish flu can’t teach us much today. Over the past century, our world globalized, geopolitics decentered, transportation and medicine progressed exponentially, and fake news and conspiracy theories prospered.
World War I’s exceptional nature is a better precedent for our times than the Spanish flu. The war killed over 20 million people, toppled mighty empires, led to the Ottoman genocide of the Armenian people, decimated Germany, created the first communist superpower, and contributed directly to WWII. One of the war’s most important lessons is that we are likely to underplay the unprecedented. The English writer H.G. Wells wrote of 1914, “All Europe still remembers the strange atmosphere of those eventful sunny August days, the end of the Armed peace. For nearly half a century the Western world had been tranquil and had seemed safe… The newspapers spoke of a world catastrophe, but that conveyed very little meaning to those for whom the world had always seemed secure, who were indeed almost incapable of thinking it as otherwise than secure.”
Our past half-century, like the one before WWI, has been relatively stable. We should not make the same mistake the British made in 1914 and assume this stability will last forever. While the coronavirus’s effects are still largely uncertain, it could permanently change the world in unimaginable ways. Regimes may fall, death counts could spiral to millions, authoritarianism may flourish, and supply chains could be severed.
The point of this article is not to fear-monger. Perhaps the world goes back to “normal” in a few months’ time. But, history teaches us to question our assumptions of constant stability. The world has unexpectedly changed dramatically before and it can do so again. Like WWI, this pandemic will surely end. The question is whether it will have permanent, drastic consequences.
WWI teaches us that we should not focus on the little things as we prepare for a possible shakeup of the world order. In August 1914, British Chancellor David Lloyd George was deeply concerned with maintaining investor confidence to prevent a financial collapse. Likewise, newspaper headlines throughout March 2020 tracked stock market nosedives, while President Donald Trump downplayed the virus to shore up market confidence. Lloyd George would soon learn that a financial collapse was the least of his problems. Already, this April, we’ve had a similar awakening as the headlines from Wall Street have been replaced by death tolls and horrific reports from heroic healthcare workers on the front lines.
An obsession with the markets in August 1914 and March 2020 was an indication that the gravity of the situation was not understood. During both these periods, the world was stuck in the pre-crisis mental framework that market developments were all important. The unprecedented nature of the moment could not be grasped. As H.G. Wells wrote about Britain in August 1914, “It was like a man still walking about the world unaware that he has contracted a fatal disease which will alter every routine and habit in his life.” Today, we have caught more than a metaphoric disease and history teaches us that it could change everything.

To distract myself from the unprecedented fear, anxiety, and uncertainty that have been brought on by the global COVID-19 pandemic, I finally caved and downloaded TikTok.
Yes, I know. There are so many other things that I could be doing with my time like reading a book, learning to cook, or even journaling again. But all of those require me to actually put in the effort to think, concentrate, and engage — something I barely have any motivation for. So, I’ve taken to mindlessly scrolling through TikTok videos, memorizing TikTok dances after watching fifty #SavageChallenge videos, and laughing uncontrollably at other relatable comedic content.
I am far from alone. In fact, social media consumption has spiked since the mandating of self-quarantine and closing of bars, restaurants, and other public venues, especially Instagram and TikTok. Just in the past couple of weeks, more than two thousand TikTok influencers saw engagement with their content increase by 27 percent, and certain Instagram pages have seen a 76 percent increase in daily accumulated likes on their posts.
But just the other day, as I laid on my bed scrolling through TikTok videos — despite my weekly Apple Screen Time reports screaming at me to get off my phone — I stumbled across a particularly disturbing #MugshotChallenge trend, where people posed as if they were taking a mugshot. Some big influencers like James Charles, Corinna Kopf, and Avani Gregg even went as far as to use makeup to feign being beaten, with fake bruised eyes and bloody noses. Many, including some of their own fans, have expressed extreme discomfort with these posts, complaining that they glorify domestic violence. The rise of domestic abuse cases due to mandated self-quarantines makes these social media challenges and posts especially inappropriate and extremely insensitive.
This particularly hit home for me because domestic violence is rampant in the South Pacific. As recently as 20118, the United Nations estimated that 60 to 80 percent of women and girls in the Pacific experience physical or sexual violence by a partner or other. And with mandated self-quarantining in response to COVID-19, people suffering from domestic violence are at an even higher risk now than ever before. Just in the past couple of weeks since I’ve been home, there have already been very violent, public incidents of domestic violence, with women beaten (in one incident, even to death) by their husbands or ex-partners. In one case, a seven-year-old child called 911 to report her father violently beating her mother; in another, a woman was attacked with a hammer and burned alive, dying the next morning after being admitted to the hospital in a coma. But keep in mind that these are only the incidents that have gotten public attention. Nearly half of domestic violence goes unreported in normal times. Imagine the number of cases that are probably going unreported now.
Even more than isolating them with their abusers, the pandemic also puts those suffering from domestic violence at high risk due to the rise of economic stresses like job instability. With the closing of many businesses like bars, restaurants, and other non-essential services, people are being put out of work, heightening the tensions that come with feeding members of the household and paying rent and utility bills. Indeed, studies show that domestic violence increases with the rise of unemployment. And with women earning 24 percent less than men globally, financial instability and limitations on mobility might stop women abused by their partners from leaving.
Because of the closing of resource centers, self-isolation mandates, and emphases on social distancing, people suffering from domestic violence might not feel like they have anywhere to go. In many Pacific cultures, where social distancing seems foreign and where we are accustomed to coming together to hold each other as family in both times of desperation and celebration, women and other people suffering from domestic abuse in the Pacific are extremely vulnerable during this pandemic.
And right now, social media is one of the best, or even only, platforms for us to connect with and support domestic violence survivors. In fact, in Tonga, the Women and Children Crisis Center is looking to move their resources online considering that 62 percent of their nation’s population uses social media. Hopefully other domestic violence services in the Pacific follow suit.
All of which makes the #MugshotChallenge — which not only glamorizes and minimizes their abuse, but also has the potential for retraumatizing them — absolutely unacceptable. During these unprecedented times, we need to be using social media to support and uplift each other, especially those most vulnerable, not to re-trigger and tear each other down.

With millions facing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Donald Trump signed off on a $2 trillion relief package — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — last month. The legislation offers borrowers of federally-held student loans a reprieve from payments for six months, through Sept. 30, without accruing interest.
Many graduate students at Harvard have private loans, however, not all of which offer comparable accommodations.
Bryan O. Buckley, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health and the outgoing president of the Harvard Graduate Council, said he has both federal and private loans.
“My wife and I both have student loans. All of her loans are federal loans and so she did get a reprieve,” Buckley said. “For me, I have both federal loans, and also private loans. For my federal loans, that works. But as I'm entering into the job market, I'll have to start paying my loans back.”
“I have quite a lot of private loans and so far they have not made any moves so far as to do anything to kind of help,” he added.
One such private lender for graduate students is the Harvard University Employees Credit Union, a non-profit financial cooperative exclusive to University staff, students, and alumni.
Eugene J. “Gene” Foley, the President and CEO of HUECU, said the institution is “probably” the largest lender of student loans for Harvard graduate students.
Foley said the Credit Union is making adjustments to loans on a case-by-case basis.
“We will do interest rate reduction, we will do payment deferrals, we'll do a combination of things,” Foley said. “Our reps have been very busy as students have been calling in and seeking help, and we're trying to triage this on a case-by-case basis rather than just putting one program out there that's kind of a blanket fit.”
Noelle G. Graham — a student at Harvard Law School who has taken out all her student loans with HUECU — wrote in an email that she feels the Credit Union’s individualized approach could impose undue pressure on those struggling with their finances.
“While administering relief on a case-by-case basis offers flexibility to the institution, it raises uncertainty for those needing the relief,” Graham wrote. “It also puts the onus on each individual to vigorously advocate for themselves. And those who need this relief the most are also likely those who are feeling the most exhausted and distressed right now.”
Graham said she hopes the Credit Union will provide the same relief as the federal government due to “extreme financial uncertainty” posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Foley said the Credit Union is offering “a lot” of student loan relief comparable to federal programs. He also argued in favor of the individualized approach, noting that solutions could be “a better fit” if they are “tailor-made” to meet a particular student’s needs.
“We are doing a lot of the things that the federal government's doing, but we're doing them on a case-by-case basis to see if we can really help people out and figure things out,” Foley said.
Graham — a co-president of the Law School’s student government — said that while she is not required to make payments until after she graduates in 2021, law students who are about to graduate are particularly concerned about paying back loans.
“Many students at HLS work at private law firms after graduating, but if those firms decide to postpone their start date, then that may become a real issue for some people,” Graham said. “Students going into public sector jobs are likely in an even more precarious position.”
Foley said “the lion’s share” of recent requests for assistance coming to the Credit Union relate to student loans and mortgages. HUECU has also offered one-time skip-a-pay and three-month payment deferral options for consumer loans and personal loans.
He said the Credit Union is adapting its financial relief for Harvard students and staff as the pandemic unfolds.
"I'm not sure what the extent or the duration of this financial crisis is going to be, so we just wanted to get programs up and running out there, right away, that would help people,” Foley said. “And then we have centrally triaged the requests coming in, so that we can have a very good finger on the pulse in terms of what the problems are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard plans to issue $1.1 billion in bonds to capitalize on low interest rates, Bloomberg News reported Thursday afternoon.
The University will sell up to $573 million in revenue bonds through a state agency, use the proceeds to refinance outstanding debt, and sell $500 million in taxable bonds for “corporate purposes,” according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service this week.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that the transactions constitute “active financial management designed to lock in lower rates.”
Susan Shaffer, a vice president at Moody’s, told Bloomberg that the transaction is “part of a long-term planned debt activity” because the University's “liquidity is ample.”
Experts say Harvard’s decision is consistent with sensible financial strategy.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School, said he approved of Harvard’s decision to issue bonds given current interest rates. The Federal Reserve cut its baseline interest rate range to 0 to 0.25 percent in mid-March.
“It is smart for an institution like Harvard, with a stellar credit rating, to issue debt with interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum near all-time lows,” Longo wrote in an email.
Harvard has the highest-possible credit rating, an Aaa, from Moody’s Investor Service.
“The money could be used for a number of reasons, including refinancing existing debt, to fund operations, or to put to work in attractive investment opportunities,” Longo added.
Christian T. Lunblad, a business professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wrote in an email that the transactions seemed “pretty reasonable.”
In addition to refinancing its debt, Lundblad speculated that the “corporate purposes” could include relief from diminishing revenues amid the coronavirus pandemic.
As the public health crisis progresses, the University’s financial challenges amass: Harvard faces a potential endowment hit and the loss of major revenue streams, including executive education programs.
“Depending upon the specifics laid out in the bond issue, that may simply be a sort of bridge loan to get through the large reduction in revenues in the face of fixed costs (faculties, faculty, etc.) that have to be paid,” Lundblad wrote.
Thomas D. Parker '64, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, cautioned that Harvard should be conscious of the optics of borrowing.
“Harvard needs to be careful that this doesn't leave the impression that it now has plenty of money and doesn't need to make reductions in spending,” Parker wrote in an email. “No reason why it won't have to do some of the same things Princeton has announced for similar reasons.”
Princeton University Provost Deborah “Debbie” A. Prentice wrote in an email to faculty and staff Wednesday that the University plans to suspend salary increases for faculty and staff unless previously agreed upon, according to the Daily Princetonian. The email also said Princeton will only make new hires in rare cases.
In the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2009, Harvard issued $2.5 billion in bonds, increasing its total debt to over $6 billion. In 2016, Harvard sold another $2.5 billion in bonds to refinance some of that debt.
As of June 30, 2019, Harvard had $5.2 billion in outstanding bonds, according to its most recent financial report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and its graduate student union signed a tentative agreement setting a maximum limit on student workers’ weekly hours after a virtual back-and-forth last week, union representative Ege Yumusak ’16 announced in an email to members Thursday.
The new agreement requires that Harvard give student workers “a reasonable amount of time” to complete their job responsibilities, sets a weekly limit on average workload at 20 hours, and ensures the University will compensate student workers for all hours worked, Yumusak wrote.
The union also announced it will ask Harvard to fully fund a “bridge year” for all Ph.D. students to continue research projects interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The workload provision comes after the University asked students not to return to campus last month due to the COVID-19 outbreak, moving classes online and piloting a work-from-home program. Some graduate students reported increased workloads in the wake of the changes, according to Yumusak’s email.
“From arranging external speakers, addressing tech issues, and creating whole new curricula, to sometimes being asked to take over the lectures of a course, we are feeling the impact of not having contract protections,” Yumusak wrote.
The new agreement also follows a two-month stalemate in negotiations during which the University and the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers reached no new agreements. The two sides last reached agreements in a February negotiation session, drawing up tentative contract provisions on holidays, employee assistance, and parking and transportation benefits.
Last month, HGSU-UAW alleged in an email to members that the University had asked to suspend bargaining in the wake of the pandemic — a claim which Harvard denied.
In Thursday’s email to members, the union called on the University to grant Ph.D. students the fully-funded “COVID-19 bridge year.”
“Due to COVID-19, doctoral students across campus are unable to run experiments, travel for fieldwork, or otherwise make progress on our research,” Yumusak wrote.
In partnership with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Council, the union “spearheaded” an open letter to GSAS Dean Emma Dench advocating for the initiative.
According to the letter, the proposed bridge year would guarantee students an additional year of funding for research — independent of any external funding they may have already received — as well as healthcare and facilities fee waivers. It also asks for accommodations for students currently taking or applying to dissertation completion fellowships and “generous extensions” for students completing their qualifications or generals.
Yumusak cited the University’s new policy allowing tenure-track faculty one-year appointment extensions and promotion review postponements as a basis for the bridge year request.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University is committed to continuing bargaining sessions in the future. He declined to comment on the bridge year request.
“The University is continuing to work with the federal mediator and HGSU-UAW to confirm a date for the next negotiation session,” Swain wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lena H. Sun, a national health reporter for the Washington Post, spoke about her experience covering the novel coronavirus outbreak during the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics’s third online “Fast Forum” Thursday evening.
Sun, who co-wrote the Washington Post’s first story on the coronavirus outbreak in January, contrasted the American news media’s current spotlight on COVID-19 with an initial lack of attention to the crisis as political controversies dominated headlines earlier this year.
But the Post’s focus changed, she said, with the surge in cases of the coronavirus in Italy and Iran — along with a “hair-on-fire” briefing by Nancy E. Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in February.
“Back in those days, we couldn’t get much attention for these stories because of impeachment and politics,” she said. “And I remember when I would be sending out emails asking for people to share the stories, we would ask, ‘Counter-programming note: Not a political story, not an impeachment story. Story about a virus.’”
The increasing demand for stories on the pandemic, coupled with the need to work remotely, has led to quick story turnarounds and increased collaboration between reporters, according to Sun.
“It is very rare that you will see just one solo byline, because people are reporting at the same time, or somebody might start reporting a story and the other person will start writing,” Sun said.
Sun said she was frustrated with the White House’s efforts to “control the message,” calling it the “biggest challenge” in reporting accurately on the constantly-evolving science behind the virus.
“Instead of a public health agency like the CDC giving regular briefings with data and science, you are getting bits and pieces of it during the White House briefing,” Sun said.
Amid reports of Asian Americans facing racism in light of the pandemic, Sun described a “disheartening” experience being called a racial epithet earlier this year and emphasized the importance of Asian American representation in the media.
She said she tries to do television or visual media-based interviews when possible.
“I think it’s important for people out there to say, ‘Oh look, there is somebody who looks Asian, who is a reporter covering this. She is like a science person,’” Sun said. “It really pisses me off when [President Trump] keeps talking about it as the ‘Chinese virus.’ It is so offensive.”
Despite uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic, Sun said she remains hopeful about the efficacy of social-distancing measures, pointing to lowered death projections in Washington state.
Still, she criticized the Trump Administration’s April 30 end date for federal social-distancing guidelines, which she said raises “false expectations.”
“It is not the date. It is the data,” Sun said. “And if the data is not there, people should not go out because you don’t want to have to have that second or third wave of this stuff.”
“You want to be able to have your classes in the fall in school, right?” she added.

The Harvard Law School Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts called on the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to ensure equity and personal privacy in its response to the coronavirus pandemic in a letter late last week.
The letter — sent on April 2 — requests statistics on the demographics of people tested for the virus so that personal protective equipment and ventilators are prioritized for health facilities that demonstrate the most need, rather than major teaching hospitals, according to Professor Robert Greenwald, faculty director of the CHLPI.
“We need access to information — basically data by race and ethnicity — showing which communities and groups are hardest hit by the virus, so we can implement an equitable response and effectively distribute, for example, scarce resources,” he said.
Greenwald said this data could prevent certain minority populations from suffering disproportionately due to a lack of healthcare resources.
“We're starting to see early data that reveals that a disproportionate number of black and Latino people are dying from COVID-19, and we cannot let that happen here in Massachusetts,” Greenwald said.
The letter also asserts that documenting demographic information will ensure equitable access to testing for the virus across population subgroups.
“People across the country have watched in horror as the wealthy and well-connected have accessed testing in places where even our front-line medical workers have been unable to obtain tests,” the letter adds.
The letter raises additional concerns regarding a March 18 order by the Department of Health which mandated that the local boards of health provide first responders with a list of home addresses of people who test positive for coronavirus.
Greenwald said the order would provide first responders with a “false sense of security” since some people may be asymptomatic or lack access to testing, rendering the list ineffective.
“It will not make anyone safer and will likely put first responders at greater risk,” Greenwald said. “Our first responders have to treat everyone as though they potentially have COVID-19 and use universal precautions on all calls.”
The Department of Health has not directly responded to the letter, according to Greenwald.
Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health Monica Bharel, however, issued an order on Wednesday instructing healthcare providers to collect demographic information from confirmed or suspected coronavirus patients and send the data to testing laboratories. Laboratories must then report the demographic data of the positive coronavirus cases to the Department of Public Health. Race and ethnicity data also appeared recently on the department’s online COVID-19 dashboard.
“Robust and accurate data reporting is essential to monitoring and responding to COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, across all communities and populations,” the state order reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Varsity athletes whose spring seasons were canceled due to the coronavirus will not be able to use their extra year of National Collegiate Athletics Association eligibility at Harvard by taking a semester off, according to a Thursday email from Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise.
In an email to all spring sport student-athletes, Scalise wrote that Harvard’s decision reflected the eight Ivy League presidents’ belief that athletes should prioritize their status as students. In explaining the move, he quoted an agreement made by the league’s presidents.
“Ivy League athletes are students first and foremost,” Scalise quoted. “No student-athlete should withdraw from the spring 2020 term for the sole purpose of preserving athletics eligibility.”
Scalise’s email marked the first time Harvard Athletics has formally communicated with student-athletes who play spring sports since the Ivy League decided to cancel its season on March 11. Since then, the NCAA granted spring sport athletes an extra year of competition, though the Ivy League upheld its policy barring graduate students from competing in athletics shortly thereafter.
Yale and Princeton also announced on Thursday that any of their athletes interested in further competition would have to pursue graduate degrees at institutions outside of the Ivy League.
University of Pennsylvania Athletic Director M. Grace Calhoun, however, told the Associated Press last week that student-athletes could use their eligibility at Penn if they took fewer classes this semester or took on an additional major or minor.
But in his email, Scalise shut the door on some athletes’ intentions to use the extra season of competition at Harvard.
On Wednesday night, Harvard men’s lacrosse player Kamau I. “Isaiah” Dawson ’22 went to sleep planning to withdraw from the College for a semester so that he could use his extra year of competition in Cambridge. He woke up the next morning to Scalise’s email, which scuttled his plans.
“I was definitely disappointed waking up to that news, obviously, and kind of realizing that what I thought could have been an option is just definitively not now,” Dawson said.
He said he would now have to consider using his eligibility as a graduate student at another university, an option Scalise mentioned in his email.
Before Scalise announced Harvard’s decision, though, Dawson had said in an interview that he was willing to put his college career on hold so that he could play another season with his teammates.
“I want the extra year back, right. And I want to be at Harvard for an extra year,” Dawson had said.“I’ve been here for two years, I love it. I love the people I’ve met. So as of now, that’s the only way in which I could get that extra year back and stay at Harvard.”
Despite his disappointment, Dawson said Scalise’s email clarified Harvard and the Ivy League’s decisions for the first time since the Ivy League ruled it would not allow athletes to use their eligibility to compete in league athletics as graduate students.
In his email, Scalise wrote that Ivy League principles guided Harvard and the Ivy League’s decisionmaking on the issue of eligibility.
“The Ivy League is unique in its approach, and is established upon several overarching principles which create the enriching atmosphere at Harvard where athletics serves the College’s essential educational mission,” he wrote.
“While we know that you may understandably be disappointed, our sincere hope is that you continue to share our firm belief in the Ivy League principles and will continue on course at Harvard.”
Student-Athlete Advisory Committee co-president and Harvard baseball player Matthew R. Thomas ’21 said Thursday afternoon he believes Harvard’s decision aligns with the University and the league’s principles.
“One of the things that Bob Scalise preaches is how athletes here aren’t treated differently,” he said. “So I understand how he wouldn't want someone to make a decision that would so strongly impact their academic track, just solely because of how it would affect their athletics.”
Still, Thomas said he empathized with athletes — including himself — who contemplated taking a semester off to play an extra season at Harvard.
“As someone who was considering making the same decision, my heart really goes out for everyone who’s unable to do that now,” he said. “I wish in a perfect world that it would work out like that. But this is the policy of the school.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League and Harvard recently announced they would not allow students an extra year of eligibility due to the coronavirus despite an NCAA allowance. But many Harvard athletes say they did not consider doing so in the first place.
Ten out of 51 student-athletes interviewed — who span 15 of Harvard’s 16 varsity teams that compete during the spring season — said they plan to use their extra year of eligibility. Out of the remaining 41, 24 said they will not use the eligibility, and the other 17 said they are not sure.
Many spring athletes expected to make plays on the field or court this past month, but have instead sat on the sidelines watching different collegiate athletics bodies decide the fate of their varsity careers.
The first of those decisions came on March 11, when the Ivy League canceled the spring athletics season to slow the coronavirus outbreak. At the end of March, the National Collegiate Athletics Association decided to restore a year of eligibility to all Division I spring sport athletes. And on April 2, the Ivy League ruled it would not allow student-athletes to use eligibility as graduate students at any of the league’s member schools, adhering to a longstanding policy barring graduate students from varsity athletics.
Most recently, Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to spring student-athletes Thursday afternoon that Harvard would not permit student-athletes to use the NCAA-granted eligibility at Harvard. Scalise advised athletes that they should not withdraw from the College this semester for the purpose of preserving their athletic eligibility — an option that some athletes said they were considering.
Harvard men’s lacrosse player Kamau I. “Isaiah” Dawson ’22 said that he was willing to take a semester off from Harvard to earn another season of competition. After receiving Scalise’s email, Dawson said he would now have to consider playing for another lacrosse program as a graduate student.
“I would love to end my career at Harvard, but at the same time, the thought of only having two years left of lacrosse, or the possibility of that, just is pretty frightening to think about,” he said. “It’s something that I’ve been doing forever, so I want to play as long as I can.”
For seniors, however, the decision is more urgent.
Harvard men’s lacrosse player Robert N. “Noah” Knopf ’20 said he knew when his season was canceled that he would never play college lacrosse again. He plans to teach history and coach lacrosse at Milton Academy outside Boston after college.
“It’s obviously a hard decision to make. But I think that that was kind of what I was thinking as soon as the season and our school year was canceled,” he said. “Partially just because I have a job for next year that I'm really excited about.”
Harvard softball player Isabelle H. Haugh ’20 also said she will forgo her extra year of eligibility to pursue a job in investment banking at Lazard in New York City following graduation.
“Love the game so much and it broke my heart that I wasn’t able to complete my season,” she said. “But I think that this opportunity that I have to go and work for Lazard is something that doesn’t come around often.”
Harvard men’s volleyball player William B. Sorenson ’23 said he has plenty of time — three years — to make his decision. Sorenson, who intends to concentrate in mechanical engineering, said his unique academic and athletic interests will limit the number of graduate programs he could even consider.
“The overlap between graduate schools that have great engineering programs, and DI volleyball schools is very, very small.”
Sorenson also said he believes Harvard athletes may be more reluctant to use an extra season because of their academic priorities.
“While I’m sure at a lot of other schools, there are people that are really going to take advantage of the extra year of eligibility, I think, at least specific to the Harvard team, people had this path that they set out for themselves early on and I think they’re gonna stick to that,” he said.

Harvard announced its commitment to the COVID-19 Technology Access Framework, which allows the use of non-exclusive and royalty-free licenses of intellectual property rights for products aimed at combating the coronavirus pandemic.
The COVID-19 Technology Access Framework is a set of technology licensing principles designed to “incentivize and allow for the most broad and equitable access to university innovations” during the public health crisis, according to a statement posted Tuesday to the Office of Technology Development’s website. Stanford and MIT have also signed onto the Framework.
In the statement, Isaac T. Kohlberg — Harvard’s chief technology development officer — wrote that the new measures would increase the distribution of critical inventions to the broader public.
“The coronavirus pandemic demands that institutions and companies worldwide step up to answer the call for solutions that may spare lives, without delay,” Kohlberg wrote. “By our commitment to the COVID-19 Technology Access Framework, we are taking steps to incentivize the mobilization of lifesaving innovations and resources during a time of urgent need.”
Kohlberg runs Harvard’s OTD, which manages technology transfer — the process through which inventions are patented and then commercialized, whether through a license agreement or the formation of a startup company.
The OTD and other technology transfer offices play important roles in developing and protecting the intellectual property of academic researchers, according to Stephen J. Susalka, chief executive officer of AUTM, a non-profit dedicated to academic research development.
“It’s at that technology transfer office that a couple things occur,” Susalka said. “The invention is evaluated to determine: ‘Does it actually solve a market need? And can it be protected in a way that can be subsequently commercialized?’ And so that protection often is in the form of patents.”
Once a Harvard invention is patented, OTD can then license it to industry partners — and the income generated from that partnership can serve as a source of revenue for the University.
At Harvard, licensing income has historically yielded far smaller returns than the funding the University allocates for research. In 2018, licensing income generated just over 54 million dollars compared to 887 million dollars spent on research.
David A. Weitz, a Physics professor who obtained three patents for Harvard-based research in 2020, said the goal of technology transfer at Harvard is to maximize societal impact rather than profits.
“I think the goal of the research that Harvard people do is to have a big impact and to benefit society, benefit people,” Weitz said. “And sometimes the best way of doing that is if you develop something and you want to get people to use it, the best way of doing that is to give it to a company who can commercialize it.”
Startup companies formed by Harvard researchers through technology transfer, such as Aldatu Biosciences, have played key roles in generating testing kits to combat COVID-19. The number of startups formed at Harvard has steadily increased since 2000.
Susalka said startup companies will be important to the future of technology transfer.
“Harvard has over a dozen startups each year,” he said. “And so, there has been a greater focus on accelerating those startups, so providing the resources to get them off the ground, and then helping them get successful.”
But despite their significance, Susalka said the societal impact of patented inventions is still difficult to measure empirically.
“The challenge in measuring societal impact is that the range is all over the place,” he said. “And it’s difficult to calculate. So, how do you calculate the lives saved, or the increase in average life expectancy, or production of milk created? You know, all sorts of things. So it’s a little challenging to cover it in just a single number going forward.”

Bryce Aiken is coming home — to Seton Hall.
After a Harvard basketball career that included Ivy League Rookie of the Year, two first-team All-Ivy appearances, and almost 17 points per game across his four years in Cambridge, Aiken will play next season as a graduate transfer for the Pirates, a decision he announced this afternoon on his Instagram page.
Aiken is expected to receive a medical redshirt for his foot issues this year, and will be immediately eligible for the 2020-2021 season.
“Creating an experience that I could share with my loved ones was something I always dreamt of,” Aiken told the Crimson prior to publicizing his decision. “There’s a sense of pride that’s been manifesting inside of me because of this decision and I am so proud of that feeling.”
The talented guard was ranked No. 86 nationally and No. 19 amongst point guards coming out of high school, turning down offers from Seton Hall, Miami, Auburn, Florida State, Creighton, and other Power Five schools to be a part of Coach Tommy Amaker’s vaunted recruiting class. Four years later, Aiken pared his transfer list down to Michigan, Maryland, Iowa State, and Seton Hall, before deciding to return home to his native state of New Jersey and the school that recruited him from the start.
Aiken played his high school ball at the Patrick School, fewer than five miles from Seton Hall’s campus. The Randolph, N.J., native will now get an opportunity to play his home games at Newark’s Prudential Center, less than 45 minutes from his hometown. It’s hard to imagine a more ideal situation for Aiken, a volume shooting guard who will have large shoes to fill with the departure of Seton Hall’s Myles Powell, winner of the Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year award.
After passing up a chance to be teammates with Powell four years ago, Aiken has the potential to become the veteran face of a Seton Hall program that has been on the rise under Coach Kevin Willard. The connection between the Patrick School and Seton Hall is, unsurprisingly, strong in the basketball community. Former Seton Hall standout Angel Delgado attended the Patrick School, as did current assistant coach Grant Billmeier.
Like fellow standout senior Seth Towns, who chose to graduate and transfer to Ohio State, his hometown school, Aiken’s final decision to play at Seton Hall reflects a desire to be close to family for his final collegiate season. Both Towns and Aiken experienced repeated injury and adversity over their careers in Cambridge, and, somewhat fittingly, have chosen to spend the end of their careers at the hometown colleges that have recruited them since high school.
“Throughout this process, my main focus was to follow my heart. I am confident in my capabilities as a basketball player and believe that I could achieve success on the court no matter where I play but finding the right school for me that reciprocated that genuine feeling of love meant everything,” Aiken said. “Luckily, I didn’t have to look too far to find what I was looking for.”
Playing in his home state next season, Aiken will join a talented Pirates roster and fit nicely into the space Powell, another capable-shooting guard and creative playmaker, has left behind. Seton Hall finished the season ranked in the top 15, and will provide Aiken the opportunity to play vaunted Big East opposition on a regular basis.
It will be the Power Five basketball lifestyle Aiken once passed on, and an almost guaranteed trip to March Madness, the apex of college basketball that he never had the opportunity to experience at Harvard.
With Creighton and Villanova looking like top 10 teams in 2020-2021, and hard-nosed opposition like Providence, Butler, Xavier, and Marquette always playing tough, the conference schedule will give Aiken the opportunity to play with and against the type of talent he’d encounter in the NBA. He’ll be joining a blossoming Seton Hall program for whom a trip to next year’s Sweet 16 or the Elite 8 should be a realistic expectation.
“This is my final season of college basketball and I’m looking forward to leaving it all out there on the floor every night while representing something much bigger than one individual,” said Aiken. “Hopefully, I can help [Seton Hall] sustain their level of success and achieve great things in the coming season.
And while next year will bring with it the excitement of new teammates, a new arena, a new coach, and so much more, Aiken will also be leaving a Harvard program that he has poured much of his energies and effort into for the past four years. Those memories and experiences, like traveling to Shanghai to play Stanford his freshman year, to beating Georgetown on the road in the NIT, are not moments he’ll soon forget.
“More than anything I will miss the bonds that I’ve been fortunate enough to create with my teammates along with the shared experiences of chasing that NCAA Tournament berth,” Aiken said. “The journey was never easy for us, as we experienced the unavoidable ups and downs of sport, but we always stuck together and continued to strive for excellence.”
And although that ever-so-elusive NCAA Tournament berth remained out of reach for Aiken and the Class of 2020, who lost their chance to clinch on their home floor this season due to the COVID-19 outbreak, he and his classmates won back-to-back regular season titles in 2018 and 2019, and will leave behind the legacy of one of the best recruiting classes in recent Harvard basketball memory.
Those who follow Harvard basketball will never forget some of the memorable moments Aiken contributed, none more impressive than his double-clutch game-tying three-pointer against Columbia in overtime, good enough to make SportsCenter’s Top-10 plays. It was a night when he scored 44 points, the second-most in Harvard hoops history, and a night inside Lavietes Pavilion where Aiken reminded everyone how capable the former top 100 recruit can be.
Next year, Bryce Aiken will play his basketball for Seton Hall, with games frequently televised on Fox Sports and other nationally broadcasted outlets. He’ll be competing in the vaunted Big East as a graduate transfer, with hopes of a deep NCAA run and perhaps an NBA future beyond.
It feels appropriate for New Jersey’s own to be returning to a school nestled in South Orange. A school who plays their college basketball games at Newark’s Prudential Center — a building fondly known by New Jerseyans as “The Rock”. But in his own words, Aiken will never forget the time he spent at Harvard, turning Friday and Saturday nights at Lavietes Pavilion into show-stopping performances.
“Harvard is truly a transformative place,” Aiken said. “I am blessed to be one of the few people that have been able to represent this program and university on a national stage.”

With nothing but time and a whole lot of quarantine snacks calling your name, how can you keep yourself from running out of your favorite candies and chips on day one? Here are Flyby’s tips on how to conserve your snacks while you’re holed up inside… at least until your next trip to the grocery store.
Nothing But the Kitchen Sink 
Science has proven that the more time you spend washing your hands, the less time you have to spend rummaging through your snacks. Since you should always wash your hands prior to snacking, making sure you get in a minute or two of solid scrubbing in before grabbing a snack will help you to avoid an empty pantry.
Zoom-ba
Trigger warning: contains the sound “Zoom”
Take a break from the chips and salsa or the lemon meringue and take your newfound free time as a chance to master the Zumba Salsa or the Zumba Meringue. It’s a win-win: you get to continue conserving your stash of snacks while looking like a snack!
Insta-nt Gratification
Spend some time on Instagram! With every other Insta story a couple of weeks ago being a fruit or vegetable drawing — interspersed with a healthy dose of push-up challenges — how could you not be inspired to eat those fruits and vegetables? Forget quarantine snacks, you’re here to become the healthiest version of yourself…#until tomorrow, that is, when your utter boredom will once more have you munching away.
Keep a Distance
If staying away from the snacks proves impossible, maintain a healthy distance from them at all times (six feet minimum).
With these tips in mind, those favorite foods will last you this quarantine and more. Stay safe and treat yourself!

Dear Seniors,
This letter won’t and could never be enough to explain how much I love and miss you. This semester getting cut short didn’t just rob us of in-person classes, or activities on campus, or you of senior week and graduation; it also stole months of time I was going to spend with you. When your friends become seniors, you know that this last year is going to be unique — you’ll never experience life with them in the same way again. It’s something I hold onto throughout the year, and try to push away, so that I can be in the moment and laugh and love with you, right up until the painful goodbye. I thought I had a few more months to settle into that place of acceptance, to share my feelings and time with you and know that, when it did come time to say goodbye, we could hopefully feel almost at peace with it. Instead, I had to try to pack all of those feelings, experiences, and love into a matter of days, all while rushing around trying to pack up my room and figure out how I was going to get home. It’s not fair, and it wasn’t enough, and it was messy. It’s hard to know when the right time to cry is, or if there even is a right time. It physically hurt to leave you, knowing we’d never coexist in this space again. It’s impossible to put your love for someone into words when you’re overwhelmed by a sense of panic and loss.
I keep imagining what it’s going to be like to go sit at the table we would always sit at and know that you aren’t about to walk by and sit down with me. I keep imagining what it’ll be like to not be able to just run up three flights of stairs, or across the street, to your room to say hi or to check in on you. To pull an all-nighter together. To dance and laugh and go on spur of the moment adventures. It’s why it’s taken me so long to write this letter. I don’t even know where to begin to describe how much you mean to me and how much your presence is felt on this campus, and how empty it will feel without you.
I do have a couple of important things to say: the first of which, is thank you. Thank you for your guidance, for your patience, and for teaching me to be more confident in myself. Thank you for pushing me to always be on my toes, ready to defend my takes when chats turn into friendly debates. Thank you for clocking me on bad choices I’ve made, and thank you for making me laugh so hard I thought I was going to pee. Thank you for introducing me to new music and new people. Thanks for being vulnerable with me, and thank you for loving me. Thank you for convincing me not to take six classes this semester. (Can you imagine? Six classes? On Zoom?) I want you to know how much you are appreciated, as lacking as that word feels, and how much your life and happiness, and how much our friendship, all mean to me.
I keep trying to tell myself that this isn’t the end, because of course it isn’t. When people affect such change in you and your life, that doesn’t end just because of physical separation. If I can say anything positive about class getting moved to Zoom, it is that it has helped me to see (some of) you once a week for class, which makes the departure feel, in some ways, less abrupt. It’s helped me feel confident that we will find ways to stay close even when apart. You are a force, and have influenced this community in ways you can’t even imagine, from classes who’ve already graduated to first years who’ve really only had half a year at Harvard.
I’m so excited for you to blossom outside of the constraints of the Harvard bubble, once it’s safe for us to go about our lives again. I’m excited to see you grow and change and succeed, because of course you will. You inspire me. There’s no doubt in my mind that you can’t do what you set out to do, and I’m always going to be here to support you in whatever ways I can.
I miss you. I really, really, miss you. I’m sorry that we didn’t get more time together this semester. I can’t wait for the first time I see you again in person and get to hear your heartbeat thundering when I finally get to hug you.
I hold you close in my heart.
Love always,
Rocket, on behalf of the underclassmen
