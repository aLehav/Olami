After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At my Harvard graduation in 2015, President Drew Gilpin Faust noted in her address, “the world is only temporarily ours… we are stewards entrusted with the past and responsible to the future. We are larger than ourselves.” Her words resonated with me because I saw how they applied to the work I was about to take on as a teacher. In the classroom, I feel my responsibility to the future every day.
But over the past few weeks, I have come to see how President Faust’s words also apply to this presidential election. When Harvard students line up outside Quincy House to vote on Election Day, some of them for the first time, they will have the chance to act beyond themselves.
I wanted to act beyond myself after graduation, which is why I decided to become a teacher. As a senior at Harvard, I got to work with students from all over the world through Harvard’s Model United Nations. While hosting an international conference in Lima, Peru with more than 350 students from around the world, I began to think about how different educational opportunities look from country to country. Knowing the disparities that exist in education here at home affirmed my interest in a career in education. At the same time, my coursework in History and Literature taught me that our country was built on inequalities that still prevent many of our nation’s children from attaining the education they deserve. I realized if I was going to be a part of shaping our nation’s policies, I first needed to understand the issues up-close. I joined Teach For America for the chance to make an immediate impact in a classroom in my hometown of Buffalo.
Now that I’m a teacher, I realize that the future of our country lies squarely in my classroom—and classrooms like mine around the country. Every day that I teach, I grow more convinced of my students’ boundless potential and am eager for the day when they’re charting the path of our country. Seeing someone who looks like them in the White House has given my students, many of whom are African-American, the confidence and proof that their identities and their dreams matter. And time and time again, even my most struggling students have proven themselves capable of achieving greatness. It’s these moments that turn my previous hope into my current conviction.
But as we draw closer to Election Day, I worry for my students. When a first-grade student asked me last October, “Wait, Barack Obama won’t be president forever?” I realized that many of my students have spent their entire lives with their identities represented in the White House.
I can see the current toxic national dialogue weighs heavily on their bright young minds. I didn’t realize how greatly it affected them until one student asked if it was really true that she could be kicked out the country for her beliefs or her identity. She looked at me, terrified, and asked if I would move with her and her classmates so I could continue teaching them.
It matters who our leaders are and it matters what they say. Many of my students view President Obama as the ultimate role model and they expect another one to take his place in the White House in January. Our politicians inspire children and set powerful examples of morality and leadership. When children see bullying among candidates at all levels of the ballot, they receive implicit permission to repeat that behavior and bully one another. When politicians and pundits denigrate the identities of our children because of their race, beliefs, or gender, children feel invalidated and question their place in our nation. By contrast, when children see themselves represented by politicians, they believe their own dreams are possible. When they hear political leaders speak kindly towards and about others, they do the same. So when we vote, we must keep in mind how our leaders will influence the next generation. We must use our votes to act beyond ourselves.
This November, we can ensure our country’s moral arc continues bending towards justice for all. We must empower our children to become the next generation of leaders. We can do this by showing our students real-world examples of leaders who look and sound like them—thanks, Obama.
So as you head into your polling place, and as you consider how you will make your impact after graduation, act with your responsibility to the future in mind. Don’t just be a leader; let’s create the next generation of leaders. We are larger than ourselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, we all knew that the real rich people lived in Millburn, even though the Jewish kids in my town got spray tans and nose jobs and the Asian kids probably spent as much on AMC prep, piano lessons, and science programs. Millburn had both a downtown and debate team that Livingston kids or city planners couldn’t touch, and most of our immigrant parents had to settle for L-Town since Millburn property taxes were sky high. After eighth grade there was a mass Asian exodus to move so people’s kids could have better chances of getting into Harvard. Most importantly, the Short Hills Mall was glitzy as Kim while who would ever want to go to the Livingston one if the kid didn’t have to? Millburn was so rich that rumor claimed it once tried to secede from Essex County, which turned out to be true, but only when we were all in kindergarten and couldn’t tell one set of huge houses from the other set of small mansions. We were small-town rivalry, some of the richest towns in the state with some of the best schools in the country to back it up, and the best evidence of our wealth was our cars, meaning, that you knew you were in Livingston High when the student parking lot looked shinier than the teacher parking lot, and a kid got a Mercedes on his sixteenth birthday, and most importantly, our cars kept on getting stolen. Essex County had a history of car thefts because Newark was the capital of joyriding in the 70s, and someone once famously posted in Millburn’s town Internet forum that they’d had four cars stolen since they’d moved in, to which most people said, it took four times to learn to take the keys out?
On December 15, 2013, Dustin Friedland died in Millburn's Short Hills Mall parking deck defending his car during a carjacking, which was surprising to those of us who hung around there at least once a week. The carjacking was committed by Kevin Roberts of Newark, who defended himself during the trial. Newark was 15 minutes away by car and worlds from my house. I felt tied to it because my dad once lived there, and sometimes I helped him interview residents for his research, and I audited classes in the tech school. But I wasn’t kissing the surface of the good parts. Newark had a dioxin orange sunset. In 2015, according to Law Street Media, Newark was rated the ninth most dangerous city in the United States, jumping up ten spots since 2014 after a 23% increase in robberies and a 16% increase in murders. In 2014, the New York Times claimed that car thefts were going out of fashion, but after Friedland’s death, they published an article stating that carjacking rates were on a massive undeniable high. A Vice video on a major carjacking circle in Newark confirmed that car thefts were going down, but that didn’t mean they weren’t gonna take your car if they had families to feed.
What continues to define Essex County in my memory is the tension between what was close and what was far, faded as girls in the locker room. What it meant to be so rich, school-stressed, cherry-coked, vanilla-milkshaked, bubbly, and aggressively insular, so close to a place that was definitely not. The tension bled itself into the stories we told (i.e. rich pretty white girl was getting with her outta town dealer so what did you think was going to happen), our out-of-school interactions (i.e. he took me to Domino’s?!), our in-school interactions (i.e. if you take steroids and don’t work out you just turn fat right), our claim on New York instead of New Jersey (i.e. a twenty minute drive and thirty minute train ride to Manhattan is not “from the City”), the slang we used (i.e. bruh, yo, alldayerrday, which were appropriations but not flat-out plagiarisms). A boy in a class I audited at the tech school once asked me how smart I had to be to get into Harvard, and I wondered why he was asking that because he aced Python and worked a job and learned English in a year and dealt with a troublemaker brother, and on top of that, was reading Dostoevsky for fun. I was explaining why I went to music school on Saturdays when I wasn’t even trying to be a pianist.
There are many theories on the economic inefficiencies of inequality that try to conciliate capitalism with progressivism, including suggestions that inequality shrinks the economic pie, that wealth in this country no longer equates to productivity, and that richer people are in highly demanded jobs. But I cannot separate the rise in crime rates, the formation of a carjacking ring, and the historical prevalence of car theft in Essex County from the classed inequality, distrust, and denial that characterizes my home in my memory. If property rights are a foundational aspect of a working economy, I watched it crumble in front of me as a result of social tensions stemming from inequality, which extends past Essex County and New Jersey. Lootings during riots are expressions of distrust, and the motivating forces of strikes are perceptions of distrust. When Rosa Ines Rivera, a HUDS worker, stated in her New York Times op-ed, “While I’ve earned no college credits here, I’ve had a lesson in hypocrisy,” she is claiming distrust in Harvard’s administration, against whom she, along with 750 co-workers, organized a historic strike. When an estimated close-to-unity of black voters choose Clinton while the estimated majority of white voters choose Trump, they are displaying perceptions of an innate collective difference. I am not sure if feelings of distrust between the rich and poor, blacks and whites, powerful and marginalized, are mathematically quantifiable or significant. However, these tensions, when massed collectively, are real, tangible, heavy. They say something significant about who we are and what we want, which are the bases of any economic argument.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, we wrote an editorial about the suspension of the men’s soccer team following the revelation that they created sexually explicit documents that objectified their counterparts on the women’s team. We said in no uncertain terms that these scouting reports are disgusting and have no place at Harvard.
It is even more disappointing, therefore, that we are once again writing about this issue following the news that the men’s cross country team created similarly inappropriate documents.
When we wrote about this issue last week, we called upon the University to investigate other athletic teams in order to determine whether they engaged in similarly disgusting behavior. We are deeply saddened, but not surprised, to find out that another team participated in such blatant misogyny and disregard for their female counterparts.
The news that the men’s cross country team participated in the same behavior reaffirms the fact that the University must continue looking into these matters and pursuing consequences whenever possible and appropriate.
Still, it is important to note that the cross country team situation is different in one important way: In an email obtained by The Crimson, the team’s captain wrote that he had shared a document that “contains sexually explicit content about the girls’ team” with Coach Jason S. Saretsky, and argued that the team should be forthcoming with administrators.
The fact that the team captain sent the document to his coach underscores the influence of the administration’s swift investigation and punishment of the soccer team. These consequences have had an effect in changing the University’s culture, and have encouraged other teams to be come forward, even if only out of self-interest.
That even one team captain shared such a document with a coach is progress. By definition, these documents were all created in secret, without any intent of ever becoming public. The revelation of their existence is thus a positive step toward combatting rape culture on campus.
While sexual harassment and the objectification of women are problems that reach all parts of the University, we now know that it is a particularly widespread problem in the Athletic Department. Each team, coach, and administrator, therefore, should be investigated to determine to what degree they are complicit in furthering this toxic culture.
Administrators, both in the Athletic Department and the University as a whole, must actively work toward rooting out this toxic behavior that plagues our campus.

To the editor:
I read The Crimson’s articles about the men’s soccer team’s “scouting reports” and the men’s cross country team’s spreadsheets with disgust and disappointment. Not only because these revelations reveal the misogyny that is alive and well at my alma mater, but also because they made me think back on my own experience as an athlete at Harvard.
In the fall of 1993, I was a senior and a member of the women’s cross country team. Unlike many other sports at Harvard, the women’s and men’s cross country teams trained together and traveled together to meets; we cheered the men on as they ran their races. Late in the season, several of them appeared at practice wearing t-shirts that they had ordered to commemorate that year’s training camp. On the back of the shirt was a list, in code: two letters, then a number.
It did not take us long to figure out that the letters were the initials of several members of the women’s team, reversed. It was clear that the number was a ranking of some kind. We confronted several members of team and one of them confessed to us that the numbers indicated how many men on the team wanted a blowjob from that woman.
The women's team captain and I called a meeting with the men’s team captain and several others, and I could barely contain my rage. At the end of the meeting, they apologized and agreed that they would not wear the shirts on campus. In retrospect, we let them off easy. We should not have kept this in-house; we should have reported them to the athletic director and asked him to hand down a punishment.
I am so proud of women’s soccer team for their openness about the despicable actions of the men’s team over the past four years, and for the eloquence and strength they displayed in their own letter to the editor last week.
We have seen misogyny in so many ways during this presidential election, as a woman is on track to become the leader of the free world. But clearly, it is not a recent phenomenon.
Men of Harvard and everywhere else, who objectify women for your own amusement: you cannot stop women from being the fastest runners in the pack. You cannot stop women from doing what they want with their own bodies. And you cannot stop women from succeeding.
What you can do is to stop feeling like women with power take power away from you. You can try to imagine what it is like to experience this kind of denigration on a daily basis. And you can have respect for women and all that they accomplish, and see them as your equals in every way.

UPDATED: November 7, 2016, at 11:05 a.m.
For two years, Harvard’s admissions policies have been at the center of an ongoing lawsuit alleging race-based discrimination against Asian American applicants. The case was put on hold in advance of a Supreme Court ruling on the affirmative action case Fisher vs. The University of Texas at Austin. Now that the Court upheld that admissions policy over the summer, Harvard’s case is again moving forward.
Harvard moved to dismiss the case entirely, just weeks after the court ordered the University to release six years of undergraduate admissions data for use in the lawsuit.
More recently, a group of current and prospective Harvard College students filed an amicus brief for the lawsuit in support of Harvard’s race-conscious affirmative action policies.
Though the Supreme Court over the summer upheld race-conscious admissions policies, the plaintiffs in this case continue to fight against Harvard’s use of affirmative action. While the odds that the presiding court will rule against Harvard’s use of race-conscious policies are low, the case could set precedent for access to admissions data during litigation.
Here’s who is involved, what has happened so far, and what could come next.
In Nov. 2014, the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions filed a complaint alleging that Harvard is “employing racially and ethnically discriminatory policies and procedures in administering the undergraduate admissions program.”
SFFA’s complaint against Harvard claims that it uses racial “quotas” and “racial balancing” in the undergraduate admissions process, which, SFFA argues, disadvantages Asian American applicants and violates Title  VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In the 120-page complaint, SFFA alleges that “Harvard uses ‘holistic’ admissions to disguise the fact that it holds Asian Americans to a far higher standard than other students and essentially forces them to compete against each other for admission.”
The group cites the relatively constant rate of Asian American acceptances to Harvard over the past decade as a part of the basis for the group’s claims that the College uses “racial balancing.”
Additionally, the group claims more generally that racial preferences are never justified in the admissions process despite previous Supreme Court rulings upholding the practice. “The Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in this area has been built on mistakes of fact and law,” the organization wrote.
Harvard responded to the suit with a letter in February 2015, denying the allegations of racial discrimination and defending its “holistic” admissions process. Harvard administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, have continuously spoken out in support of the University’s policies.
Speaking at Memorial Church’s morning prayers in September 2015, Faust said, “Our vigorous defense of our procedures and of the kind of educational experience they are intended to create will cause us to speak frequently and forcefully about the importance of diversity in the months to come.”
The plaintiff in the lawsuit, Students for Fair Admissions, is a nonprofit organization formed to “promote and protect the right of the public to be free from discrimination on the basis of race in higher education admissions,” according to the group’s complaint.
Edward Blum serves as the group’s president. He is also the president of the Project on Fair Representation, another litigious nonprofit that has been involved in admissions lawsuits with other universities, including the Fisher case.
The plaintiff in that case, Abigail Fisher, was listed as SFFA’s secretary in the group’s 2013 tax exemption request, while her father was listed as the organization’s treasurer. According to the organization’s articles of incorporation included in their 2013 exemption request, SFFA “has no members” despite calling itself a “membership group of more than 20,000 students, parents, others” on its website.
An unnamed Asian American applicant who was denied admission to Harvard in 2014 is also listed in the original complaint as one of SFFA’s members and a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The complaint details that the applicant is a first-generation college student and claims that the applicant “was denied the opportunity to compete for admission to Harvard on equal footing with other applicants.”
Blum was behind several websites launched in 2014 seeking students who claim they were denied admission to Harvard, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison because of their race. Blum and his various organizations are engaged in other ongoing lawsuits—the Project on Fair Representation filed a complaint against UNC Chapel Hill’s admissions policies in November 2014, as well.
Since SFFA filed the complaint, a host of outside groups have sought to influence the court’s decision. In the meantime, Harvard and SFFA have battled for access to each other’s internal information in the discovery process.
A group of prospective and current Harvard students represented by the nonprofit pro bono legal group Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice motioned in April 2015 to intervene in the ongoing lawsuit in support of Harvard. In their motion, the students defended Harvard’s consideration of diversity in assembling its admittance pool.
While a panel of judges ultimately denied the group’s intervention in December 2015, the judges did grant the students amicus status, which allowed them to submit briefs and participate in oral arguments in court.
In May 2015, the suit’s presiding judge ruled that both sides would have a 10- to 12-month discovery process during which they could gather information and experts for use in court. Legal counsel for SFFA requested that the organization have access to Harvard admissions data, such as applicant names, personal essays, and “comments from alumni interviewers.” The judge did not grant SFFA access to this information.
Also in May 2015, a collection of 64 Asian American groups filed a complaint against Harvard with the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice. The complaint cited the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit and called for a federal investigation into what they claim is the College’s “unlawful use of race” during the admissions process.
Just a couple months into discovery, Harvard’s legal counsel requested in the summer of 2015 that the court delay the lawsuit in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling on Fisher vs. Texas and the precedent it would set for affirmative action. The case was pending for nearly a year until the Court’s ruling in June 2016.
Harvard has been involved in the Fisher case since November 2015, when the University filed an amicus brief in support of the UT Austin’s use of race-conscious admissions policies to create a diverse student body, writing that a diverse student population is “a compelling interest that justifies race-conscious admissions in higher education.”
Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow also filed an amicus brief in conjunction with her legal counsel and Yale Law School Dean Robert C. Post ’69 last November in support of UT Austin. They wrote that a ruling against using race as one factor in a “holistic” admissions process would have “devastating” effects.
The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in support of UT Austin and its use of race-conscious admissions policies on June 23, 2016. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said in his opinion after the decision that while affirmative action and other race-conscious policies can be constitutional, universities have an “ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection” on their policies and that such policies must be able to withstand “strict scrutiny.”
Harvard administrators celebrated the decision, and legal counsel for SFFA and the University met to discuss the ruling and the status of the pending lawsuit in July.
Following the status conference in July, Student for Fair Admissions’ legal counsel filed a letter requesting the release of eight years of admissions data from Harvard for use in discovery. Harvard filed a letter in response, arguing that releasing that much data would be both excessive and would infringe on privacy.
The presiding judge ordered in early September that Harvard must provide six cycles of admissions data, including student files, from the 2009-2010 admissions cycle through to the 2014-2015 cycle. The order also requires Harvard to provide reports from any internal or external investigations regarding alleged discrimination against Asian Americans.
In late September, Harvard’s legal counsel filed two motions, one to dismiss the case entirely and another to dismiss two counts of SFFA’s original complaint. Harvard argues that SFFA does not have the legal grounds to represent its members because it “cannot demonstrate that its members control the organization and that it genuinely represents them.” SFFA responded with a letter asking the court to refrain from judgment on the new motions on the grounds that they are “procedurally improper.”
Then, in mid-October, Harvard notified the hundreds of thousands of students who applied to the College in that time frame that it will share their application data with SFFA beginning on Oct. 28, omitting their names and Social Security numbers.
Later in October, current and prospective College students filed an amicus brief supporting Harvard's race-conscious affirmative action policies.
According to the court-set agenda, the discovery process could continue until 2018. The plaintiff and defendant would then have the opportunity to file motions to dispose the case and any resulting opposition and reply briefs.
While under no obligation to do so, the presiding judge could rule on Harvard’s most recent motions before then, causing the timeline of the case to change or even for the case to end.
Harvard’s release of admissions data, scheduled to have started last week, could also affect the pace of the suit, as well as set a precedent for the use of collegiate admissions data in lawsuits, according to Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at the Stetson University College of Law.
“I think that the generalized attack on race-conscious admissions as being unlawful is now essentially over for this generation,” he said. “I think we are going to see courts looking more at what’s happening inside the the inner sanctum of the admissions process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An energetic and focused women’s soccer team took to the field Saturday, clinching the Ivy League championship with relatives, alumni, students, and fellow athletes filling the stands.
Harvard won the suspenseful game against Columbia 2-1 in double overtime. Onlookers crowded the picnic tables and grass surrounding the field to cheer on the athletes and recognize the team’s seniors in their last game of the regular season.
After Harvard and Columbia scored in the first half, the crowd watched anxiously as the tied game went into the second period of extra time until forward Rachel Garcia ’17 scored the game-winning goal, earning them the Ivy League title and a bid to the NCAA tournament.

It was a moment of triumph and celebration amid what have been turbulent times for Harvard Athletics. Many students attended the game, cheering on their friends and roommates.
“My roommate is on the team, and we figured it is also a good time to support the women’s team in light of everything, and it’s the Ivy Title,” Liv R. Gundrum ’18, a goalie on the women’s lacrosse team, said.
The victory for the team came days after Harvard cancelled the men's soccer team’s season in light of the discovery that the men’s team had created sexually explicit “scouting reports” for several years, including in 2016. In the documents, members of the men’s team assessed recruits on the women’s soccer team based on their perceived attractiveness and sexual appeal. Six women who were freshmen recruits on the 2012 women’s soccer team responded to the “reports” in a joint op-ed, urging others to combat “this type of behavior.”
The mood in the stands during the game burgeoned with enthusiasm and support. Sarah N. Michieka ’17, wielding a bright poster honoring captain Bailey A. Gary ’17, was among the large number of Harvard students cheering at the game.
“We’re here for Bailey, basically all her friends are going to show up,” Michieka said.
Many athletes’ families came out to support the team at Saturday’s game, including both parents of senior players and those of underclassmen on campus for Freshman Family Weekend. The family of team member Margaret M. Purce ’17, who scored Harvard’s first goal, flew in from Maryland to cheer for her, according to her brother J.P. Purce.
Fellow athletes also came out for the game—members of Harvard-Radcliffe Heavyweight Crew, Track and Field, Squash, Swim and Diving, Women’s Lacrosse, and Women’s Basketball teams cheered the soccer players on from the stands.
“I’m a big supporter of the female sports, and I know this is an Ivy League game,” basketball player Sydney E. Skinner ’19 said. Sprinter Ngozi Musa ’19 emphasized the importance of “general support for women athletes” and added that she and Skinner had just come from a women’s field hockey game.
Members of the men’s soccer team were present at the women’s game as well, but declined to comment. The men’s soccer team apologized "for the harm our words and actions have caused women everywhere" in a joint op-ed after their season was cancelled.
Following the team’s victory, a Gatorade-soaked Head Coach Chris Hamblin expressed his pride in the achievement, saying he was “so proud of the group and how they’ve applied themselves.” He added that the team will regroup on Monday to prepare for their first NCAA game.
Meanwhile, Gary said the team was excited by the large number of fans, especially the other athletes present.
“We absolutely love the support. It’s great to see any teams out here, especially women’s teams supporting other teams because I know that sometimes we are lacking in the fans department, but it’s been really awesome, and we’ve felt that support and that momentum from the other teams,” she said.
The time and location of the team’s first NCAA game is not yet known.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parents on campus for Freshman Family Weekend largely praised Harvard’s recent decision to cancel the men’s soccer team’s season following a review that revealed the team continued to produce sexually explicit documents about female recruits.
The University's Office of the General Counsel announced last week that it would immediately review the “scouting report” produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team, reported by The Crimson last month.
One visiting parent, Dan Cousins, whose son and daughter are both involved in Harvard Athletics, commended Harvard’s response as setting an example for other teams.
“It’s probably good for the school to come down hard on the soccer team. If nothing else than to let everyone else know what’s going on, and that they have to be respectful of other people,” he said. 
Some parents said they were surprised when they initially heard about the “scouting reports,” in which members of the men’s soccer team ranked female soccer recruits based on perceived attractiveness.
Rita Nmai, whose son is in the Class of 2020, said she was “shocked.” Alix Quan, who also has a freshman, agreed.
“I guess I think it’s just sad that in today’s age that young people would act that way,” Quan said.
Michael Heijer, whose son plays on the club soccer team, had planned to watch a men’s varsity soccer game during parents’ weekend Saturday night. He called the turn of events a “bummer.”
“I think we’re all surprised and disappointed. I think it was too bad that they did what they did, and it’s unfortunate that they canceled the whole season,” Heijer said, but added, “They probably got what they deserved.”
Cousins said he hopes the University’s actions sends a message to other teams, including the wrestling team, of which his son is a part.
“Sometimes I worry about them because they’re very macho and they could go off and maybe without thinking get themselves into trouble and do the wrong thing. So I’m happy with the school for doing it,” he said, referring to the season cancellation.
Joe N. Giaquinto, a father of a Harvard freshman, praised the University’s actions and said he did not think “other Division I schools” would have cancelled a season under similar circumstances.
“Harvard took necessary action. This is why we send our kids to schools like this, because they don’t hide things away,” Giaquinto said.

Student groups with a membership training or vetting process—commonly known as “comp” processes—that fail to meet the Undergraduate Council Finance Committee’s “comping inclusivity standard” may be ineligible for UC funding, according to a new Finance Committee policy.
The policy, called “The Students Against Needless Comping Exclusivity Act”—the “STANCE Act”—passed unanimously during last week’s Finance Committee meeting and allows students to submit anonymous complaints about a comp process that could lead to a UC-run investigation and potential loss of funding.
UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said the committee would hold off on enforcing the new policy until the entire Council had an opportunity to discuss it.
Greenlaw, who has been considering ways to address what he characterizes as needlessly exclusive comp processes since at least last semester, said exclusive comps were a “consistent and serious enough” issue that he felt the Finance Committee should act to address it.
“Harvard University is unique in that we are one of the few colleges and universities that requires you to get into Harvard after getting into Harvard,” Greenlaw said in a committee meeting earlier last month. “Almost every single organization that I'm aware of has some sort of comping process.”
“There are few people, I think, that genuinely enjoy the [comp] process. In many ways, it's only a barrier to entry,” he added.
According to the new policy, a comp process is considered “legitimate” if “a student organization’s criteria for determining membership are rationally linked to the function and purpose of that student organization in a non-onerous fashion.”
Greenlaw said such a policy would prevent student group leaders from “requiring people to do some sort of wacky thing to get into [their] organization.”
After receiving a complaint, the Finance Committee may vote to open a “comping inquiry” into an organization if the committee has “reasonable suspicion” that the organization’s comp process is inconsistent with the new “comping inclusivity standard.”
The inquiry, which involves reaching out to the organization in question to gather more information about its comping practices, may result in the committee recommending against providing UC funds to the group. The Council as a whole would have the authority to accept or reject the Finance Committee’s recommendation via majority vote.
Already, Finance Committee rules stipulate that groups are only eligible to receive funding from the Council if they accept membership “from all Harvard College students” and “accept all members who complete the comp process.” However, the Finance Committee previously lacked an enforcement mechanism for the policy.
Student groups that are denied funding due to the new policy may “remedy [their] standing with the Finance Committee” only if they modify, in writing, their rules for membership eligibility, and then notify members of the organization that the change has been made.
Last semester, Greenlaw and Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 proposed legislation to gather data from the Office of Student Life about comp requirements, but the legislation was ultimately tabled.
At the time, several representatives worried about the Council exerting too much control over student organizations.
“I think that we should not overstep our bounds and tell a particular club what they can or cannot approve people based on,” then-Parliamentarian Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation switched to all-electronic tolling on the Mass. Turnpike last week, paving the way for the realignment of the I-90 interchange in Allston and opening up land for potential Harvard development.
At a press conference late last month, Massachusetts Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said drivers will no longer need to slow down for toll booths  and will instead drive under gantries that charge tolls via electronic “EZ-Pass” transponders mounted on windshields.
“By the end of 2017… it will be as though we never had tolls on the Massachusetts Turnpike,” she said. “You will be able to go at highway speeds from one end to another.”
The all-electronic system was launched on Oct. 28. Pollack added that traffic congestion will be “particularly intense” for roughly the first month while construction crews dismantle old toll booths.
The demolition of toll booths on the I-90 Interchange in Allston allows MassDOT to move forward with the $270 million plan to replace the aging Allston viaduct and realign that portion of the Turnpike. It will take place on 91 acres of former rail property that Harvard bought in 2003.
The realignment project will be accompanied by the erection of a new commuter rail station set to open in 2020. The process of realignment, meanwhile, is subject to state and federal regulation and likely will not begin until 2018 or 2019, according to Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey.
Allston resident Galen Mook, a member of a community task force advising MassDOT on the project, said that the realignment would improve safety and allow for faster traffic, a common concern among residents.
“The design of the Turnpike as it is now to 1960 standards is actually incredibly dangerous as a roadway,” Mook said. “It’s got a pretty steep reverse curve.”
The switch to electronic tolling would also increase safety and fuel efficiency on the Turnpike, according to Pollack.
“We are confident that we are going to see a safer pike, a more convenient pike, a pike with fewer fender benders, a pike where people are burning less gas, and emitting less pollution and greenhouse gases,” Pollack said.
Boston’s urban planning agency and MassDOT have hosted community meetings on the project. Harvard plans to develop the former railyards following the highway realignment but has no specific plans at the moment for what this development would entail, Casey said. Harvard’s current developments in Allston lie along Western Avenue, north of the Turnpike project.
A 2014 letter of intent between Harvard, MassDOT, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority outlined the eventual trade of land rights for the construction of the realigned Turnpike on Harvard-owned land, Casey said.
This land is currently under environmental remediation by CSX Transportation, the railway company that maintained easement rights to the land until relocating its operations to Westborough and Worcester. The transition of the land from CSX to Harvard is expected to be completed by the end of November, Casey said, completing a process of transferring rights that began in 2007.
Allston resident Harry Mattison, also a task force member, expressed interest in seeing new development on the land following realignment.
“There’s a lot of excitement about turning what has been this huge abandoned industrial area owned by Harvard into a place that’s going to create new jobs, housing, and vibrancy,” Mattison said. “Hopefully what gets built is very different and it shows how thinking and priorities have evolved over the last 50 or 60 years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading figures in the field of artificial intelligence discussed its present and potential future impact on individuals and nations at the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum Friday.
Kennedy School lecturer and national security expert Juliette N. Kayyem introduced the topic by discussing the current prevalence of artificial intelligence and the significant shifts the technology may cause in relations between various groups and industries. She noted the tensions that may arise when trying to find a role for artificial intelligence in everyday life.
Panelists then discussed how artificial intelligence has influenced their particular work and society more generally.
Edward W. Felten, the deputy chief technology officer of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, commented on a recent White House report that explained the challenges faced when trying to incorporate artificial intelligence into the government. In contrast, IBM Watson’s general manager David Kenny described commercial aspects of artificial intelligence and how it can “perform layman jobs enabling humans to conduct more advanced tasks.”
Rosalind W. Picard, a professor at the MIT Media Lab, talked about how machines can learn to identify environments and thereby behave appropriately. Picard further added that artificial intelligence will be able to measure emotion in a classroom and determine the state that is most conducive to learning.
Nico P. H. Miailhe, president of the Future Society and a senior fellow at the Kennedy School, said the mission of his organization is to “question technology and innovation and how to govern them, not regulate them. To manage them and use the Government School as a vehicle to convene the University to carry this conversation forward.”
The Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs partnered with the Future Society at the school to organize the forum.

Harvard’s historic penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations could be subject to change after consultation with faculty members, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview Thursday.
“I think this is a time for conversation about what alternatives there are,” Faust said about the sanctions. “If people want to propose alternatives, that ought to be a matter for discussion in the Faculty meeting.” 
The policy—which, starting with the Class of 2021, will prohibit members of single-gender social organizations from holding student leadership positions, becoming captains of varsity teams, and receiving College endorsement for fellowships—was the product of months of work and closed-door meetings with final club leaders and College administrators. While many Harvard affiliates—including coaches, professors, and members of the Harvard Corporation—have praised the new policy, hundreds of students, faculty, and former administrators have publicly criticized the decision.
In particular, former Dean of the College and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 has spearheaded the faculty movement against the sanctions, contending at a Faculty meeting last Tuesday that the policy was “creating a blacklist” of students who chose to associate with single-gender clubs. Lewis introduced a motion condemning the penalties at the packed meeting and called for a Faculty vote in December on the topic.
When directly questioned at the Faculty meeting last Tuesday, Faust did not specify what a vote for Lewis’s motion could accomplish or how Faculty input could influence or change the policy. In the interview Thursday, Faust said the next meeting in December would be an opportunity for concerned professors to propose alternatives to the controversial policy. While the exact solution may be flexible, Faust said any policy would need to address the “problem”—the rising influence of single-sex social organizations on campus.
“The way I talk about is I say, ‘here’s the problem, and now how do we figure out the solution,’” Faust said. “I’ve never said that this policy is a perfect instrument,” she continued, citing alcohol abuse, sexual assault, and exclusion as three issues a policy would aim to address.
“[The policy] was meant more to marginalize the power, the social power of these groups. To undermine the kinds of circumstances that lead women to line up outside of clubs on Friday nights hoping to be chosen on the basis of their outfits, appearance, whatever,” Faust said. “We designed an answer that seemed to be the best option.”
Still, she would “welcome the Faculty’s participation” in crafting a policy that best addresses the issues posed by single-gender clubs, Faust said.
“So this is a problem that we’re going to solve, and we’re going to figure out the way to solve it, and that's where I will direct the Faculty to go,” she said.
None of the arguments faculty members voiced at the meeting swayed Faust, and she offered rebuttals to several critiques of the policy brought by professors at the Faculty meeting during the interview Thursday.
Faust said Lewis’s motion does not actually address the single-gender social organization policy, but instead focuses more broadly on principles of discrimination and association.
To Government professor Eric M. Nelson ’99—who expressed frustration that Faculty members were not consulted before the policy was rolled out—Faust responded that, to her understanding, the Faculty has not traditionally been involved in shaping undergraduate life and played little role in decisions like the derecognition of the final clubs in the 1980s and the randomization of House assignments in the late 1990s.
Responding to the prevalent critique that the penalties infringe on students’ freedom of association, Faust countered that all-male organizations restrict women’s liberties.
“My freedom of association to join the Porcellian does not exist, just to start with,” she said, referencing Harvard’s oldest final club.
Moreover, Faust said, the “freedom of association” argument has historically been used to defend discriminatory organizations and policies.
“Freedom of association is a concept that was used widely in the white South to combat Brown v. Board, to combat the Civil Rights Act. It’s an argument that has been used to sustain and support discrimination,” she said. “It gives me chills to see it used in this instance as a defense of what I see as exclusionary policies on the part of organizations in the College.”
The earliest date at which the Lewis’s motion could go to vote is at the next Faculty meeting in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When polls open on Nov. 16 and 17 for the graduate student union election, Harvard undergraduates casting their ballots might not realize they are making history.
No other union representing academic workers at a private university has ever included undergraduates in its election vote, to the knowledge of Gordon Lafer, a professor at the University of Oregon who works at the university's Labor Education and Research Center and has been an organizer for several unions.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers began employing undergraduate organizers this semester, paying them for their efforts to spread the word about unionization to undergraduates, some of whom had not heard about the National Labor Relations Board decision in August that paved the way for this election.
Samuel J. Potter ’20 said he came into his first semester at Harvard knowing he wanted to be involved in labor activism. Potter said members of his family have been active in unions for generations, and coming from Idaho, which he called an “arbitrarily anti-union state,” he saw his chance in Cambridge.
Potter said he helped poster for the Student Labor Action Movement and then showed up to a meeting, where HGSU-UAW organizers asked if anyone was interested in helping the movement.
“And here I am,” Potter said.
As the election date nears, both graduate and undergraduate organizers have upped the ante—spreading the word about the election in dining halls, knocking on dorm room doors, holding more information sessions, and calling eligible students directly.
AN 'UNPRECEDENTED' ELECTION
“The election is unprecedented in several ways,” Harvard’s Associate Director of Labor and Employee Relations Erica F. Crystal wrote in an email, citing the fact that this is the first election since the NLRB’s August decision recognizing certain graduate and undergraduate students as workers, as well as the broad category of workers belonging to the potential bargaining unit.
“Although this is a large election with more than one location, the NLRB is used to handling these kinds of election,” she wrote. Crystal, who said she formerly worked for the NLRB, added that the Board has been holding elections in the private sector for more than 70 years.
NLRB board agents will control the election, with “an equal number” of HGSU-UAW and Harvard observers “to witness the election and assist the board agent,” Crystal wrote. Board agents may even decide to cover the windows of an election site if they think it compromises voter privacy.
According to Crystal, students will be assigned to vote at one of the three locations—Phillips Brooks House in Harvard Yard, the Dental School, and the Business School—as required by the NLRB.
“That means that College students are assigned to vote in Cambridge; professional degree students will vote in the location of their school; and GSAS students are assigned based on their program,” Crystal wrote, referring to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Ph.D. student Andrea Kriz, who is based out of Massachusetts General Hospital, raised concerns about the inconvenience of voting locations. She said some of her colleagues may have to travel about 40 minutes on the T to get to their assigned location, and added that some students may have already left for Thanksgiving break.
“There is no absentee ballot system, so if you’re not on campus that day you just can’t vote,” Kriz said, adding that she personally still has not received notification of her assigned location.
Crystal wrote that it is possible to vote “out of location,” but that the votes will be “subject to challenge.”
The NLRB’s challenge rules allow any person to vote, and for officials to decide on the validity of a ballot after the election if a ballot has been challenged. For example, if a challenge is raised about someone casting multiple ballots, board agents set aside the ballot and determine if a student voted once, at which time the ballots in question get placed back in the pile of ballots to be counted.
The agreement signed Oct. 18 by union organizers and Harvard stated that the only worker category the groups could not agree upon was “doctoral students who have been employed in the bargaining unit for at least one semester during the past academic year and who are not currently in their Dissertation Completion year (or final year of their program).” These are students who are currently not on the payroll for being a teaching or research assistant, but who have worked in that capacity and might requalify to be protected under the bargaining unit in the future.
The parties agreed that these students will vote under challenge. Per NLRB rules, these ballots will be marked and set aside in envelopes, and at the end of voting, deposited into a locked safe. Based on the numbers, if the challenge ballots could sway the election one way or the other, a hearing will be necessary to decide the outcome.
ALL EYES ON HARVARD
Other universities are taking notice of Harvard’s historic election.
Barbara A. Knuth, Cornell’s senior vice provost and dean of its Graduate School, wrote in an email that Cornell is paying attention to whats going on at Harvard.
“We’ll be watching Harvard particularly regarding their community’s participation of eligible voters in the election process,” Knuth wrote. “Should there be an election at Cornell, our primary concern is encouraging all eligible voters to exercise their right to vote on the question of union representation given its importance for the context of graduate education at Cornell.”
Two graduate student union organizers at the University of Chicago, Cody Jones and Claudio Sansone, said their union effort is also paying attention to Harvard. Sansone said they are currently in the middle of an authorization card campaign, but that their union effort has been around for nine years.
“We have a little bit more to do. It’ll take a little bit longer, but we’re still thinking of going ahead quite fast as well, just not as fast as Harvard,” Sansone said.
John T. Trumpbour, a research associate at Harvard’s Office of Labor and Worklife, said at this time, he cannot predict with confidence how the vote will go.
“I wish we had exit polling for our graduate students,” he said with a laugh.

LACONIA, N.H.—It took two Harvard Republicans six hours to wind their way through more than eight miles of streets in this old mill town. They knocked on dozens of doors here trying to convince residents to vote for their candidate, crossing paths along the way with canvassers for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
But unlike most years—in fact, unlike any year since the group’s founding in 1888—members of the Harvard Republican Club were not canvassing for the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Instead, they drove two hours north of Cambridge to rally support for incumbent New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte.
The two members, Kent K. Haeffner ’18 and Dustin L. Zacharias, a German exchange student, did not mention Trump when speaking to residents at their doors. In August, the Republican Club publicly denounced their party’s standard-bearer in a statement that criticized Trump as a “threat to the survival of the Republic.” Since the club formalized its stance, its members have focused on supporting candidates in down-ballot races.
Ayotte is in the final stretch of one of the tightest Senate races in the nation. Just weeks ago, it seemed as though her Democratic challenger and current New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan would safely prevail. FiveThirtyEight, a website known for its elections predictions, gave Hassan a 67.1 percent to win the election on Oct. 20, against a 32.9 percent chance for Ayotte. On Saturday, its updated predictions gave Hassan a 50.3 percent chance, against 49.7 percent for Ayotte.
Hoping to sway any remaining undecided voters, Haeffner and Zacharias met with Ayotte campaign staffer Elliot Gault outside Winthrop House early Saturday morning before the group made the trip up to New Hampshire, where other university students were also helping canvass.
“It’s coming down to the wire,” Gault said to them. “Your job today is not much more than just one question—who you support. Be sure to focus on the local issues.”
The Ayotte campaign views Laconia, a suburban community whose Main Street is still lined with mom-and-pop shops, as a city that could be indicative of how the rest of New Hampshire will vote.
“They call it a bellwether town,” Haeffner said.
“On election night, we’re going to be watching for this town,” he added. “And you can say, ‘We made this happen.’”
Saturday was the Republican Club’s second canvassing trip to New Hampshire of the general election, according to Haeffner, though there were “a lot more trips during the primary season,” especially for Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, two former Republican presidential hopefuls.
Disappointed that their favored candidates lost to Trump, Haeffner said, “Lots of folks are just done with the election.”
“Frankly, I’m ready for it to be over too, but I want to make sure we win things like this race,” he added.
Zacharias, the German exchange student, said he is out on the campaign trail for the first time.
“I used to do this stuff in Germany,” Zacharias said about canvassing. “Naturally, I’m attracted to the conservative platform, so I looked up Kelly and thought coming out here today would be for a good cause.”
“Hopefully winning cause,” Haeffner added.
Some Laconian residents seemed to appreciate the canvassers’ efforts, saying they intended to vote Republican up and down the ballot. Others, believing that the students were campaigning for Trump, were initially put off. One even tried to close the door on the canvassers, until Haeffner and Zacharias said they were there for Ayotte.
“I know you don’t like the presidential candidateswe’re with you on that one,” Haeffner said to the resident as she began to shut the door.
The majority of doors Haeffner and Zacharias knocked on over the course of six hours went unanswered. The residents were the targets of several campaigns’ canvassing efforts: a pile of old political leaflets sat on the front porch of one house.
One  homemade sign read, “Yes! I know who to vote for. No! You can’t change my mind. No! I don’t want to talk to you. PLEASE STOP. Printing political postcards–nobody ever reads them!”
Undeterred by such responses, Haeffner emphasized the importance of canvassing.
“Every voter we talk to is important, whether they’re undecided, for, or against,” he said. “If they’re for Kelly, then we have to make sure we robo-call them later to get out to vote; if they’re clearly against, we can make sure not to spend too many resources trying to change their minds.”
“The campaign that knocks on the most doors is usually going to win the race,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise cancelled his trip to China with the men’s basketball team “in part because” Harvard found that the men’s soccer team continued to produce sexually explicit documents after 2012 and ended the team’s season.
Last month, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team created a “scouting report,” evaluating women on their perceived sexual appeal. After the Office of the General Counsel discovered that the “reports” continued through 2016, Scalise announced that the men’s soccer team would not compete in the rest of their season.
The Crimson reported Saturday that past men’s cross country teams had also created online documents where they sometimes wrote “sexually explicit” comments about members of the women's team.
“I decided it would be best not to travel with our men’s basketball team to China, in part because of this situation, but I also had the wonderful opportunity to present the Ivy League championship trophy to our field hockey and women’s soccer programs,” Scalise wrote in an emailed statement.
The men’s basketball team will be traveling to Shanghai to play Stanford, and Scalise had been expected to speak at a Harvard Alumni Association event. According to an Alumni Association email, Harvard Divinity School professor and Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton will “provide additional remarks” in Scalise’s stead.

Undergraduates will be asked to vote on whether they believe final clubs and Greek organizations should go gender-neutral, after the Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to put the proposition on the ballot for this month’s UC election.
In a narrow vote, the representatives approved the question “Do you think the unrecognized single-gender social organizations should have gender-inclusive membership by a means different than the current College administered sanctions?”
The question will join two other referenda on the UC’s November ballot: one questioning whether the College should repeal its sanctions on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and one questioning whether the Harvard Turkey should become the official mascot of the University.
The sanctions, announced in May, bar students starting with the Class of 2021 from holding campus leadership positions, becoming varsity sports captains, or receiving College-sponsored scholarships if they are members of final clubs or Greek organizations.
UC President Shaiba Rather ’17, who co-sponsored the proposition with Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, said she hoped the question would help the UC gather data on whether students wanted social groups to go gender neutral even if they did not support the College’s policy.
“We think there’s a distinction between beliefs on going gender-inclusive and beliefs on the policy,” Rather said. “You can see the policy as an overstep and an overreach, but still want these groups to go gender-inclusive.”
During last Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Rather and Banks spoke about their own views on the sanctions, arguing that the policy would help to reduce discrimination on campus.
Many representatives praised the proposition, suggesting that it would allow the UC to have a clearer mandate based on more student data.
“What I want to be able to do is to go to the administration and say: 'People support the idea of what you are going for, but people are opposed to the implementation,'” Mather House representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said.
Other representatives argued that alternative options, such as a survey independent of the election ballot, would be a more effective means of gauging student opinion.
“This question muddies the water,” said UC Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18, who co-wrote the other referendum question that specifically concerns the College’s sanctions. “I think we’re going to get the necessary information from the question that’s already been asked.”
Two-thirds of the Council must vote to put a question on the ballot, and 67.6 percent of the UC voted for the proposition.
“One of the biggest criticisms of the University with the sanctions was the lack of involvement and engagement with student voice,” Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said. “Let’s bring student voice into that discussion and put this on the ballot.”
During the meeting, representatives also debated a motion to support the House Intramural Council’s vote to exclude Dudley graduate affiliates from the House intramural sports league.
Several representatives expressed concern that it was unfair and potentially unsafe for undergraduates to play intramural sports against graduate students in Dudley.
“When you have an 18-year-old on the field playing against a 26-year-old, there’s such a physical imbalance in a contact sport that can lead to some dangerous situations,” Student Initiatives Committee Chair Madeline H. Stern ’18 said.
Eliot House representative Taylor D. Marquis ’18 also said some graduate Dudley intramural sports competitors have NCAA varsity experience in their sport, even while NCAA varsity undergraduates are excluded from participation in intramurals for their sport.
Laila M. Smith ’17-’18, the UC’s Dudley House representative, argued against the legislation, saying the legislation was based on hearsay rather than credible data about the number of NCAA alumni who participate in intramural sports and the historical success of Dudley’s intramural teams.
Smith also said barring graduate students from participating might leave the relatively small number of Dudley undergraduates without enough members to form teams.
“We have a lot of House pride. We wouldn’t want to be coupled with another House,” Smith said.
The UC ultimately voted to pass the legislation reaffirming the House Intramural Council’s vote.
The Council originally intended to discuss recent controversy surrounding sexually explicit documents produced by the men’s soccer and cross country teams, and even considered moving into executive session—a rare private session of the UC. But, they delayed conversation on the issue to a future meeting.

More than one million Massachusetts residents cast ballots between Oct. 24 and Nov. 4, marking the Bay State’s first time allowing early voting in a presidential election—more than 20 percent of the state’s nearly 4.3 million registered voters.
Early voting allows for more people to partake in elections—particularly those who may not otherwise be able to, said Matthew A. Baum, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government.
“The U.S. has a pretty bizarre system where we hold our national elections on a weekday, it’s not a holiday, and it’s primarily during business hours, so it’s harder for people to vote in the U.S. and participate in an election than it is in any other advanced democracy,” Baum said.
“Early voting is, in effect, extending the period of the election,” he added. “This is a good thing, because it allows people who might have difficulty showing up to the polling place on that one day to have other options. I don’t think that it’s terribly surprising that a lot of people are doing [early voting].”
Timothy P. McCarthy, a lecturer at the Kennedy School, said voting advocates see early voting as one piece of a larger effort to strengthen the democratic process.
The early voting turnout for Massachusetts “is certainly a confirmation for any of us who have been advocating for years now to give people better opportunities to exercise their right to vote,” McCarthy said. “Democracy works best when as many people as possible are engaged,”
While some critics of early voting argue that the process decreases overall voter turnout because of a reduced emphasis on Election Day voting, Baum said the high early voting turnout speaks for itself.
“There is some debate among election scholars about whether, in the net, early voting might lead to a decline in overall participation–because there’s an argument that some of what causes people to turn out is the fact that this is a big national event,” Baum said.  “There’s a big social norm of showing up, and it’s almost a celebration of democracy. You might sacrifice some of that by showing up the earlier week.”
McCarthy added that this election season’s political climate may have spurred public engagement in the political process as a whole.
“In terms of the turnout, I think there’s been a democratic outpouring of energy in this election–that means both that people are more engaged in our national politics in this moment and also that people are more fervently determined to exercise their right to vote,” McCarthy said.
McCarthy also traced the rise of participation to the “anger and alienation” that this presidential  election has sparked across the country.
“So I think there may be a situation right now where the alienation that so many people feel, the anger that so many people feel towards politics and our political candidates and our political institution are actually inspiring them to engage more actively in politics,” he said. “It’s something of a paradox, that the anger and alienation that we see across the country may be fueling a rise in engagement politically from people all over the political spectrum.”
Ballots submitted during Massachusetts's early voting period will be counted on Election Day.

Competing in its first team racing events of the nearly completed fall season, the Harvard sailing team finished the weekend with two third-place results the Hap Moore Team Race and the Mike Horn Trophy. After strong performances in last weekend’s fleet racing events, the Crimson continued the trend in the Sister Esther Open as the team claimed the regatta’s top prize.
“The team had a strong weekend down in southern New England,” sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky said. “We won the Sister Esther Open and finished third at the Hap Moore Team Race.  We’re thrilled with these results as we head into both the coed and women’s Atlantic Coast Championships next week.”
However, Harvard’s relative inexperience in team race events was on display after having graduated much of its top racers last spring.
“Coming off our best weekend of the season, we had a moderate change of pace by focusing on team racing,” junior crew Kevin Coakley said. “We graduated most of our team racing team so we lost some races that we could have won and our scores this weekend reflected that, but we look at this as a very positive learning experience. Better to make mistakes now than in the spring, when team racing counts.”
SISTER ESTHER OPEN
Fleet racing proved profitable for the Crimson for the second week in a row as it claimed victory in a 59-point performance at this Newport, R.I. race hosted by the Coast Guard Academy. The B-Division crew, anchored by junior skipper Dylan Farrell and senior crew Priscilla Russo, led the charge by posting seven top three-finishes in their eight races. The duo’s worst performance was sixth in the 20-school field of FJ racers.
In the A-Division, sophomores, skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and crew Alejandra Resendiz, also posted similarly strong results. Their 37 points and two individual race victories helped them claim divisional victory, as well. Harvard’s strong results in the event will hopefully pay dividends come spring.
“Fall regatta performance can posture a team for success in the spring,” Coakley said. “Rather than taking this weekend off and resting our top sailors, we are taking this opportunity to make a late push in the Performance Rankings. The foursome of [Karnovsky, Resendiz, Farrell, and Russo] helped lead that charge by winning a regatta that we could easily have not entered in order to give a rest weekend.”
The University of Rhode Island and Coast Guard rounded out the top three with 96 and 100-point performances, respectively.
HAP MOORE TEAM RACE
Racing against six other in-conference squads in New London, Conn., the Crimson sent its veteran group to compete in its first team racing action since last spring.  Led by skippers, junior co-captain Nick Sertl, sophomore Nick DiGiovanni, and sophomore Jackson Wagner, Harvard sailed its way to a third-place finish and a 9-9 record.
Harvard failed to take advantage of Saturday’s mild conditions, posting a 5-4 record in the first day of action. But the 8-knot gusts that pervaded throughout the day on Saturday, picked up extensively to 15-20 knot winds on Sunday and crews were forced to adjust their tactical strategies.
“When the breeze picked up on Sunday, we had to make decisions more quickly and mistakes were more costly,” Coakley said. “This gave an advantage to teams with more experience and some of our finishes suffered accordingly. However, it was not a major factor and situational awareness on the part of our teammates helped us get back in the races after a mental error.”
The Boston College Eagles finished victorious by posting a 13-5 record, while Tufts claimed second at 10-8.
MIKE HORN TROPHY
In the first Crimson hosted event in the past month, some of the Harvard’s younger members competed in yet another team race against three local area schools, Tufts, Boston University, and MIT.  Racing in FJ’s in a three round-robin format, the Crimson finished third of the four teams in in the event with a 3-6 record.
The slight breeze of 4-8 knots provided little impact on the final outcome, as the team of skippers, sophomore Taylor Gavula, freshman Lucy Wilmot and freshman Jessica Williams, and crew, senior Emma Wheeler, senior Cara Kennedy Cuomo, and sophomore Lena Episalla, were only able to best the Engineers on the weekend. The group’s 3-0 record against MIT provided all of its wins in the round robin format.
When the round robin was completed, the Jumbos came out on top after besting its competitors in each of its nine races, while the Terriers and Engineers placed second and fourth with 5-4 and 1-8 records, respectively.  But in the elimination rounds for a chance at the Horn Trophy, roles reversed as MIT beat Harvard 1-2-6 in the Bronze Medal Match, while BU beat Tufts 1-2-6 and 1-3-5 to claim the final victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Check out the game told in photos here.
When the Harvard women’s soccer team took the field for sudden death overtime on Saturday afternoon against Columbia, it was not just the game that was on the line for the two sides. After four months and a combined 33 games contested by the squads, the Ivy League title race was coming down to just two 10-minute extra periods.
The Crimson entered the contest atop the conference standings, one point ahead of the second-place Lions. A win by either team on this last day of the season would hand it the championship, while a draw would allow Harvard to hold on to the top spot by the slimmest of margins. As it stood after 90 minutes, the next goal would win the Ivy.
After forcing several acrobatic saves from Columbia goalkeeper Allison Spencer in the first overtime period, the Crimson pressed again early in the second. Senior forward Joan Fleischman swung in a corner from the left of goal after making a run to the end line, and after a Lions defender missed with her attempt at a clearing header, the ball fell to another senior forward, Rachel Garcia, right in front of the net.
Without hesitating, Garcia fired home, clinching the game and 2016 Ivy League title for Harvard (10-3-3, 5-0-2 Ivy) at Jordan Field. The win completed an undefeated run through the conference slate for the team, the third time it has done so since 2011.
“Joan dribbled down and played an absolutely perfect ball, and I had time to take a touch and finish,” Garcia said. “I was lucky enough to be there.”
Meanwhile, Columbia (7-6-4, 4-2-1 Ivy) dropped to third in the standings after Brown beat Yale later in the day. The Lions were clear atop the table halfway through the season after winning four straight in conference, but earned just one point out of a possible nine through its last three league matches. Harvard secured nine points out nine in the same period to catch and pass them.
“We’ve been in difficult situations all year, knowing that we really had no other option but to beat Princeton, beat Dartmouth, and hope for a chance to play against Columbia [for the title],” said Harvard coach Chris Hamblin. “I’m so proud of the group and how’ve they applied themselves throughout the whole season. To see it come to this exciting ending, and finish in our favor, is just unbelievable.”
Just as it started brightly in conference play before hitting a few road bumps, the Crimson came out with energy against the Lions and took an early lead before being pegged back. Star senior forward Midge Purce used her speed to blow by the defense and put Harvard up in the 8th minute. The goal put her total tally for the year at 12, a mark only four players in school history have surpassed.
Columbia responded shortly after at the midway point of the first half, however, equalizing through a well-placed header from junior midfielder Caroline Militello. The game settled down after the goal, as both teams slowed down their pace of play, and the score line still read 1-1 as they headed into halftime.
After a back-and-forth first half, the Crimson seized control of the game in the second half, holding a majority of the possession and finding the better scoring chances. The best chance of the half came for the Lions in the 63rd minute, however, after freshman midfielder Maggie Basta conceded a penalty with a foul in the box.
But with a chance to put her team in the driver’s seat to secure the conference title, Columbia sophomore forward Emma Anderson fired her penalty kick wide. The play continued to be wide open as the Lions looked for the goal that would put them atop the standings, while Harvard was just as offensive-minded, despite needing just a draw to secure the championship.
“We said earlier in the week that we weren’t going to try and play for a draw, we wanted to go out and win the game,” said Crimson senior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack. “That’s what we did, we wanted to go out and attack them. We knew that would come with risks, but it was worth it in the end.”
Harvard ended up outshooting Columbia 18-5 over the second half and overtime periods, and the offensive-minded strategy paid off with Garcia’s title-clinching goal.
After being honored before the game in the team’s annual Senior Day ceremony, and celebrating afterwards with the Ivy League trophy, the seniors on the team still have at least one more game to play, this time in the NCAA tournament.
“It’s [NCAA tournament] a new season,” Hamblin said. “All we know right now is that we have one more game. We don’t know where it is, or who it’s against—we’ll find that out on Monday—but I’m really happy that we get a chance to play again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day was filled with celebrations from pregame to postgame.
With a 5-1 win over Columbia (8-9; 2-5 Ivy) on Saturday, the Harvard field hockey team (12-5; 7-0), claimed the Ivy league title, and thus a berth into the NCAA tournament. The win also marked the first time the Crimson has finished a season undefeated and untied in conference play. The win was the team’s 12th overall for the season, tying a program record.
The day began with Harvard honoring its eight graduating seniors with an on field ceremony. Forward Sarah Finnemore, forward Mellisa Balleza, forward Clare McClintock, midfielder Kyla Cordrey, midfielder Abbey Thornhill, midfielder Elizabeth Warner, back Sophie van Weede, and back Annie Morefield all played their last games for the Crimson this past Saturday. In that game, these seniors saw a realization of a process that started their freshman years.
“I think it’s so exciting to win I’m so proud of everyone on this team,” Cordrey said. “It’s been a long time for this program and the first time for this team. I knew that this program was transforming when I was a freshman and this was the dream; this was why you choose a program like this.”
Overall, five different players scored for Harvard on Saturday. The five goals were also a season high for the team. In the first half, freshman midfielder Bente van Vlijmen scored the Crimson’s first goal in the 11th minute. Columbia’s only goal of the game came in the 16th minute, as senior forward Katie Ruesterholz equalized for the Lions. However, Harvard replied swiftly, as sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte and sophomore forward Kathleen Young scored back to back goals in the 20th and 21st minute. Van Weede closed out the scoring for the first half with her goal in the 35th minute, and the Crimson went into the half with a 4-1 advantage.
In the second half, the only goal came from sophomore back Olivia Allin, who scored in the 44th minute. All five of Harvard’s goals came off of penalty corner plays.
“It was fantastic,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “The goal coming in was to go through the Ivy league unbeaten. From the moment we started the game today, it became clear that we were eager to make it happen. We were really able to dominate the game overall and corners were really sharp today.”
Junior midfielder Ellie Cookson added two assists on the day, giving her 10 for the season. That mark ties her for seventh most in the Harvard record books.
In what was her last regular season game for the team, van Weede also had one of the best games of her career Saturday. The Amsterdam native accumulated five points in the contest, contributing three assists in addition to her goal.
“It’s such a way to go out in the regular season” van Weede said. “It’s been such a huge growth from where we started. Freshman year, we didn’t win that many games in the Ivy league, so I couldn’t have imagined in four short years we’d be here.”
Harvard’s next first opponent in the NCAA tournament has yet to be announced, as the draw occurs on Sunday night (we’ll probably have to change this during edit right?). However, despite the uncertainty, the team is sure of its ability to tackle any opponent.
“I think we’ve played really well and we’ve played to the level that we can,” van Herwaarden said. “We are in a great position to compete with anyone; so it is going to be luck of the draw, but, for now, we’re going to enjoy the moment.”
The team shares its coach’s optimism about the tournament, but also recognize the challenges they face ahead.
“Our season is definitely not over,” Cordrey said. “Now we have bigger dreams, bigger goals, and we just got to keep working towards that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s rugby team faced off against Dartmouth in the Ivy League championship game, it emerged victorious in shutout fashion to claim its first varsity title in the sport.
This Sunday, the Crimson (6-2, 4-2 Ivy) hosted the Big Green (7-1, 6-0) in a rematch of that 2013 game, only to allow its Ancient Eight foe to avenge its loss three seasons ago. Dartmouth trumped Harvard in an intense contest by a score of 14-5, seizing its second consecutive title.
The Crimson, after dropping Sunday’s season finale, has lost three consecutive 15’s matches to the Big Green, including its only two losses of the 2016 season. The match marks the lowest-scoring contest of the year with respect to both Harvard’s point total and the two teams’ aggregate score.
“It was a really hard-fought match,” freshman Delia Hellander said. “Even though we didn’t come out on top…we played as a team, we did all we could, [and] I have no regrets. We played for each other out there.”
In the middle of the second half, after minutes on end of offensive pressure right up against the Harvard try zone, Dartmouth finally broke through the seemingly impermeable Crimson defense. The Big Green tied the match on freshman Isabel Boettcher’s penalty try resulting from Harvard’s illegal high tackle, and the ensuing two-point conversion thrust Dartmouth into the lead with mere minutes remaining.
Following the lead change, the Big Green controlled the majority of the match until the final horn, further padding its advantage with a try from junior Rachel Hand, upon which the two-point kick was also converted. Hand broke free from a pack of players and trotted into the try zone largely uncontested with eight minutes remaining.
“We were really just trying to move the ball forward and keep our feet driving,” said Harvard senior Claire Collins about the late-game momentum shift, “but Dartmouth had a great defensive stand.”
The match opened in a very tight, closely contested manner, with play concentrated near the center of the pitch. After almost 15 minutes of attrition-esque rugby, Dartmouth began showing glimpses of offensive lust, advancing the ball dangerously close to the Harvard try zone with multiple strong runs downfield. The Crimson, thanks to Hellander’s sturdy solo tackling on the back line, trudged out of its defensive half of the pitch with a determined resolve, eventually restoring the match to mostly neutral, mid-field play.
“We were really just resilient,” said Hellander regarding her team’s stalwart defense. “We had a tight interior defense that we could stop them with before they even got out wide.”
The game did not see its blank score change until the end of the first half, when Harvard was finally able to bring the ball into its offensive half of the field. Sophomore Genevieve Quirion drove in a try in the 39th minute, giving her team the 5-0 lead through the first frame.
Upon resuming the match after the halftime break, play was relatively stagnant for almost 20 minutes, characterized by lots of back-and-forth jostling for field position. This grinding ended, of course, when Dartmouth seized momentum en route to stealing the late-match victory.
The Crimson ends this year’s 15’s campaign having outscored its opponents 359-63, while the Big Green amassed a grand score of 362-156 over that span.
“This was a really tough game,” Collins said. “I feel like calls went both ways, no one really had a strong advantage…and [Dartmouth] really hung tough. My hat’s off to [the Big Green]

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So far this season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has played back-to-back conference games on five different weekends.
But even after this past weekend’s slate of games, the Crimson has yet to complete a weekend sweep.
After handling Cornell in Ithaca in a decisive manner on Friday, Harvard was unable to repeat its success in the Big Apple, succumbing to Columbia in a four-set match.
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 1
After losing the first set, Harvard (7-14, 5-7 Ivy) held a 24-23 lead in the late stages of the second set. But on the Crimson’s first set point, the Lions’ Anja Malesevic put a kill past the Crimson defense to equalize the game. A kill from co-captain Corie Bain would give Harvard its second set point right away, but again, Malesevic recorded another kill to extend the match.
Columbia (13-9, 8-4) was bending, not breaking. And for a Crimson squad that has had trouble closing out sets, it seemed like the Lions were ready to pounce on Harvard’s inability to convert a set point and ready to take a two-set advantage.
But then it was Harvard who continued to prolong the set. After an attacking error, junior Paige Kebe knotted the game up at 26 points apiece. Then it was sophomore Jocelyn Meyer, who, on Columbia’s second set point, delivered to bring about a 27-all tie.
The two teams went about trading points until a Malesevic error and a Bain kill gave Harvard a 32-30 permanent advantage.
“I’m pretty proud of how we stayed composed and relaxed and were able to perform under pressure,” Kebe said. “And it just shows how much we’ve grown this season. Especially having a lot of freshmen and younger girls on the court, it’s really good for them to be exposed to that pressure.”
But in a similar situation in the next set, the Crimson was unable to continue its momentum at Levien Gymnasium. Harvard staved off two set points from Columbia, but its inability to convert its one set point of the frame proved costly, as the third set point was the charm for the Lions. The Crimson failed to return Kalie Wool’s serve, giving the Lions a 2-1 advantage.
From there, Columbia rolled through the fourth set without much resistance, winning the last frame by 11 points and bringing its record this conference season to 8-4—already three wins better than last year’s finish.
“It was a little more disappointing,” Kebe said. “That’s a game we also could have won.”
Bain and sophomore Christina Cornelius led the charge offensively for the Crimson, recording 14 and 12 kills, respectively. Bain also added 15 assists and 12 digs for her sixth triple-double of the year.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
Entering this weekend, Harvard had lost its first set eight times in conference play. Only two times had it been able to recover from that deficit.
Friday made it three.
“I think losing the first match was a bit of a wake-up call,” Kebe said. “We treated it like more of a warm-up set than we should have.”
With one set to each team entering the third frame, Cornell quickly jumped out to a 6-0 lead behind five service aces from Natalie Danenhauer.
“There’s no reason for any more than two points in a rotation,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said last weekend. “So when we get them to dial in and do that, we’ll have success.”
But the Crimson stormed back almost immediately with six straight of its own behind two kills from Bain and a kill apiece from Kebe and freshman Grace Roberts Burbank. From there, the Crimson rolled on, ending the set on a 11-4 run to push ahead by one set entering the fourth frame.
It was the freshmen who sealed the deal in the fourth set, as an ace from Erin McCarthy and kills from Burbank and Maclaine Fields ended the Big Red’s night. Bain led all Crimson with 10 kills, while Meyer set a season-high with nine on the night.
“I think the Cornell game went pretty well,” Kebe said. “It was one we definitely expected to win. I think we did a good job of performing and executing our game plan.”
Elsewhere in the Ivy League, Princeton suffered its first loss to a conference opponent at the
hands of Yale on Friday, cutting the Tigers’ lead over the Bulldogs to just one game with one more weekend to play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a five-game winning streak heading into the weekend, the Harvard men’s water polo team looked to extend its success during a tough Northeast Water Polo Conference slate that included matchups against two ranked foes. This was the second weekend this season that the Crimson has faced off against the exact same three teams.
Similar to the first weekend in October, No. 10 Harvard (22-6, 7-3 NWPC) dropped one out of three games. The Crimson’s lone defeat came against the team it’s tied in the polls with—No. 10 Princeton (17-8, 8-2), meaning that the team split the season series with both the Tigers and No. 20 St. Francis (12-12, 5-5), while sweeping both of its games against struggling Iona (9-20, 1-9).
HARVARD 17, IONA 7
After a bitter defeat to Princeton, Harvard took out its frustration on Iona Sunday afternoon. The Gaels were looking for redemption after a 16-10 loss to the Crimson on Oct. 1, but its trip to Boston only involved another blowout.
Iona began the game’s scoring, but two quick strikes by sophomore attacker Nathan Ondracek ensured that the opening goal would lead to the only lead the Gaels would enjoy on the day. The two teams would go into the second period tied up, 3-3, but not before Ondracek would promptly complete his hat trick.
Harvard began its prolific scoring stretch with a four-goal run out of the gate in the second quarter. Mid-game falters, a theme of the weekend for the Crimson, became apparent, however, as Iona scored three straight goals in response. The half would end with Harvard leading by just two goals, 8-6.
“Most of our adjustments need to be mental, like within each individual,” junior co-captain Harry Tafur said. “I think a lot of times we over-think things, we get too emotional in the game. That’s what we really need to improve on.”
But the second half was magic for the Crimson as sophomore attacker Nick Bunn scored three straight goals to earn his second hat-trick of the weekend; he finished with a career-high five goals in the match. The Gaels would score their final goal of the game in the third quarter, and Harvard cruised to a victory to close out the weekend.
PRINCETON 11, HARVARD 10
The Senior Night matchup lived up to its billing, pitting two rivals that may soon meet again in the playoffs.
The Crimson had a commanding 5-2 lead early before a two-goal rally by the Tigers brought the visitors to within one. Then things got interesting.
The physical play came to a crescendo after sophomore two-meter defender Grant Harvey swiped at the face of Princeton’s Ryan Wilson after the Tiger sophomore hit the post with a shot off a counter-attack. The action would return to the other side of the pool, where Harvard upped its lead to 6-4; but afterwards, play came to a halt because Wilson had suffered a cut.
After a long stoppage involving a bit of yelling between the crowd and the teams, and a meeting between the two coaches, the Tigers converted a penalty shot and free possession to tie the game at six apiece.
“I think that we had to ride some momentum and settle down,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We didn’t do that in the middle of the third. We missed some shots. Their goalie made some good blocks. They had some really good field blocks.”
After a momentary 7-7 tie, Princeton went on a game-winning three-goal run. The Crimson would pull closer, cutting the Tigers’ lead to 11-10 with just under seven minutes left in the game. But despite immense pressure on both sides of the pool, neither team was able to convert again. Harvard’s last shot, as time expired, went over the net.
“It was a tough loss to swallow, since I think everybody knew we could have played better as a whole, and as individuals,” Tafur said. “But it’s not the end of our season, so we’ll practice and get back into it.”
HARVARD 11, ST. FRANCIS 9
After putting up a poor showing against St. Francis in the two teams’ last meeting, the Crimson was able to tie the season series and start the weekend off on a good note this time around.
Contributions by senior attacker Noah Harrison and co-captain Joey Colton put Harvard up 5-2. This seemingly comfortable lead evaporated with three unanswered goals by the Terriers.
The second and third quarters saw back and forth action in which St. Francis tied up the game multiple times after the Crimson tried to inch ahead. Bunn also netted his third goal of the game to earn his first hat trick of the weekend.
Just hours before Senior Night, the other two fourth-year players, two-meter defender Dan Stevens and attacker Viktor Wrobel, made their presences known with a goal apiece to give Harvard a 9-7 lead that the team would not relinquish. The Terriers tried to chase the Crimson, but the two teams traded goals and the Crimson would go on to win 11-9.
“They’ve done a great job,” Minnis said. “They’ve won a lot of games. You know, they are a great group of guys. I’m proud of them and they will be missed in a year.”

As if any of us needed another reason to spend money on the Uber app… Our favorite ride-share behemoth announced last week that it will offer free rides to people in Boston who are commuting to one of the city’s polling locations.
Unfortunately, for all of you students who did not receive your absentee ballot in time from your home state, this is not the cure-all for you. Still, check out the internet to see if Uber is offering a similar deal in your city. We know Philadelphia—currently in the throes of a public transportation workers’ strike—will be full of people zipping around the city in Uber and Lyft cars, because both companies are offering free rides on Tuesday.

If you were on campus this weekend, you probably witnessed the influx of middle aged individuals sporting a red “P’20” baseball cap, a “Harvard Parent Class of 2020” pin, and a glowing grin filled with pride. That’s right - this weekend was Parent’s Weekend at Harvard. 
You and I both know Harvard quite well — they would absolutely never invite parents to campus from all over the globe if remarkable and memorable events weren’t in store. Here is a comprehensive review of three of the most popular events parent’s attended over the weekend:
Making the Most of Harvard’s Opportunities: Eight Concrete Suggestions from Students with Professor Richard LightWe don’t know whether or not Richard Light is an advisor here at Harvard College, or an imposter trying to make his first break as a stand up comedian. Parents were steadily cracking up throughout his entire presentation--from his student impersonations, to anecdotes about his own children, to snide comments about the bane of all freshman requirements (Expos of course). On top of being incredibly funny, he gave parents some really great advice to pass on to their freshman, on how to tackle the course selection, and make your academic experience at Harvard College a 10/10. He really seemed to have a genuine concern for all of the undergraduates at Harvard and their academic experiences here, and that really showed through to the parents.
Harvard Today and Words of Wisdom for FamiliesNo, "Harvard Today" is not referring to Flyby's beloved newsletter, unfortunately. This event was still a winner, though. Drew Faust, like always, offered a warm welcome, as did the rest of the faculty that spoke. It was quite the unique experience, as the panelists offered individualized insight by taking information from the audience about their own children, and building from them anecdotally. Just like Richard Light’s event, Harvard did a wonderful job personalizing Parent’s Weekend this year.
Class of 2020 Tailgate LuncheonOverall, the tailgate was decently attended. However, it was a good time for parents to meet one another, relive their college days, and comfort themselves that their kids might actually be having fun. But most importantly, it essentially tripled the fan turn-out to the Harvard-Columbia game, which everyone always knows is usually completely overwhelming (you know, because there are usually so many seats to pick from). On top of all the bonding and Harvard spirit, Crimson football ended the day with a swift W.
These Class of 2020 parents who are equal parts eager and proud already can't wait for Junior Parents Weekend in just two short years!
