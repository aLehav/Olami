After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night when junior guard Christine Clark eclipsed 1,000 career points, the Harvard women’s basketball team coasted to an easy victory, 85-59, over the University of Massachusetts in Cambridge.
The Crimson (8-5) was dominant from start to finish, as the Minutewomen (2-12) never once held the lead throughout the contest.
“I’m very pleased,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We were in dire need of a win, and I thought everyone did a really nice job. It was a good win for us tonight, with [Clark] hitting a pretty amazing milestone that we’re proud of.”
The win snapped a three-game Crimson losing streak, the squad’s longest of the year. Harvard’s 85 points scored and the 26-point margin of victory represented its highest marks of the season.
The Crimson produced consistent offense in the opening half and led, 48-29, at the break. Harvard put the game out of reach over the span of six minutes early in the second frame, scoring 12 straight points to take a 31-point lead.
The team shot just over 50% from the field (33-of-64) to maintain its first-place Ivy League rank in field goal percentage.
Clark entered the game 12 points shy of 1,000, and she reached the mark early in the second half on a free throw. Despite inserting herself into a group that includes only 18 other players in the history of the program, the milestone was apparently far from Clark’s mind during the game.
“I think that it’s such a prestigious club to be a part of, so I’m very honored,” Clark said. “I didn’t even know [that I reached 1,000], actually. They announced it during a timeout, and I was just like, ‘Oh, really? Okay.’ ”
The junior was not done, however, and she went on to score seven of the next nine Crimson points to register a game-high of 19 before Delaney-Smith took her out to give younger players some time on the floor.
“[Clark] went in spurts, I would say, but at a time when we needed some spunk, she ran the floor,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s the kind of player she is, so I was very happy for her and pretty pleased with the effort.”
Harvard received a boost from junior center Elise Gordon, who came off the bench to score 14 points, her career-high, in as many minutes on an efficient 7-of-8 from the field.
“[Gordon’s performance] was wonderful; she did great,” Delaney-Smith said. “I know she has that in her, and she knows she has that in her…. She’s very capable of that, night in and night out.”
Senior guard Victoria Lippert, the only other active member of the Crimson in the 1,000-point club, also spearheaded the Harvard attack. Lippert racked up buckets throughout the game to finish with 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting.
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle only missed one shot all night to contribute 12 points and a team-high six rebounds. The British Olympian has reached double figures in six of her last seven games.
UMass, which struggled to keep up with Harvard offensively, was led by freshman guard Nola Henry and junior forward Kiara Bomben, the team’s only players to reach double figures with 15 and 11 points, respectively.
The Crimson had the advantage Wednesday night in nearly every major stat category. A particular highlight was the 22 assists the team amassed, its season-high.
Despite being ranked seventh in the Ancient Eight in turnover margin, Harvard pressured the Minutewomen defensively all game and forced UMass to commit 23 turnovers. The Crimson coughed the ball up 15 times but managed to limit its opponents to only 10 points off turnovers.
“We’re averaging probably close to 70 points, so I never think the point production is ever a problem,” Delaney-Smith said. “I honestly feel that giving up 80 or giving up 90 is more our consideration…. It’s the defensive end that we need to keep getting better at.”
After a trip to San Diego that saw Harvard lose both games by double digits, the Crimson bounced back decisively in the win against the Minutewomen and demonstrated its ability to dominate a game from start to finish.
“I think we can always improve [on controlling the game], and it’s a very important area, as far as putting together wins,” Clark said. “But I think we did a really good job tonight, and we can build off of that and keep getting better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a one-and-a-half month stretch since its last conference game, the Harvard men’s hockey team will resume ECAC play with two road matchups against Princeton and Quinnipiac this weekend.
The Crimson (4-5-1, 3-3 ECAC) currently sits in ninth place in the conference, but the team still has 16 league games remaining to make up ground.
Although the Harvard offense started the season hot and racked up at least three goals in five of its first seven games, the Crimson has struggled to produce much scoring in its recent matchups.
Harvard has not found the back of the net more than twice on a night since its last win, which came against Cornell Nov. 16. The team is coming off a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Northeastern at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson will travel to New Jersey to take on the Tigers on Friday. Princeton (3-7-4, 2-3-3) is going through a rough stretch, having failed to achieve a victory in its last seven outings.
The Tigers are led by junior forward Andrew Calof and sophomore forward Tyler Maugeri, both of whom have amassed a team-high 16 points this year.
The Harvard penalty-killing unit will look to continue Princeton’s struggles on the power play, as the Tigers have converted only two of its last 16 opportunities on the man-advantage.
Princeton and the Crimson have matched up relatively evenly in recent years, and the two squads battled to 4-3 outcomes twice last year, with each team winning one.
After the showdown with the Tigers, Harvard will wrap up the weekend against Quinnipiac (14-3-2, 8-0) in Hamden, Conn. The Bobcats have been playing some of their best hockey of the year recently. After going 3-4-1 to begin the season, Quinnipiac has gone undefeated since, winning 11 of its last 12 games with one tie.
The Bobcats have achieved success in part because of their sound defensive play. Quinnipiac ranks second in the ECAC with only six power-play goals allowed all season, and senior goaltender Eric Hartzell leads the conference with a 1.43 goals against average.
The Crimson will need to contain senior forward Jeremy Langlois, who has spearheaded the Bobcats’ offense throughout the season and has accounted for a team-high 20 points.
Quinnipiac handily disposed of Princeton when the two teams faced off on consecutive days in early December by scores of 3-1 and 3-0.
Harvard’s penalty kill as of late has lacked the intensity that characterized it earlier this season. In its first eight games of the year, the Crimson allowed opponents to score only two goals on power plays. But in its last two games, Harvard has surrendered five goals while down a man.
After sitting atop the ECAC in penalty killing percentage for much of the season, the Crimson finds itself ranked eighth in the conference at 82.1 percent entering Friday’s game.
Harvard has not won since mid-November, and the team will need to hold its opponents to low scores this weekend if it hopes to start the new year off on the right foot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many of us have been relaxing during our winter break, freshman forward Jimmy Vesey of the Harvard men’s hockey team has been busy on the ice with the U.S. National Junior Team at the 2013 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship in Ufa, Russia.
After two exhibition matches before Christmas, USA finished 2-2 in pool play, routing Germany, 8-0, and Slovakia, 9-3, while falling to Russia, 2-1, and Canada, 2-1.
Vesey tallied three assists in the game against Slovakia on New Years Eve.
Having qualified for the playoff round after finishing third in its group with six points in pool play, the Americans defeated the Czech Republic, 7-0, in the quarterfinals.
On Thursday, USA faced off against rival Canada in the semifinals, who had finished undefeated in pool play.
The Americans jumped out to an early lead with two goals in the first period, then another in the third before the freshman forward from Harvard struck to make it 4-0.
Vesey netted his first goal of the tournament, receiving a pass from teammate John Gaudreau of Boston College streaking along the right side, and then beating Canadian goalie Malcolm Subban, cutting the puck across to the left and burying it into the net above the stick side.
USA will face Sweden in the Gold Medal Game Saturday at 8 a.m, the first matchup in the finals between the two squads in tournament history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Small ball is all the rage in the NBA. Instead of furnishing their frontcourts with tall, shot-blocking centers and forwards, many NBA teams have found success in employing smaller, faster lineups lacking true centers to stretch the floor, juice-up their fast-break offense, and wreck havoc with smaller, stingier defenders.
For example, with the absence of a healthy center, the Golden State Warriors have employed three-guard, two-forward lineups regularly en route to posting a 22-10 record through early-January. Taking advantage of favorable matchups, focusing on gang-rebounding schemes, and playing stingy, pesky defense, the Warriors have beat teams with more traditional “true” 7-foot centers.
And when you are talking about NBA small-ball, you can’t forget to mention the defending champion Miami Heat who consistently employ smaller, quicker lineups with LeBron James guarding the 4-position.
While the small-ball trend has very much become an integral part of many NBA team identities, it also has garnered much attention in the college basketball world as well. John Calipari at University of Kentucky is famous for his dribble-drive offense schemes, plays that create spacing and penetration to take advantage of favorable matchups to allow for easy lay-ups and looks for open perimeter shots.
Remember Shaka Smart and the bracket-busting VCU Rams on their last two NCAA Tournament runs? Well, Smart’s Rams charged deep into the Tournament by utilizing lineups with four perimeter players that forced a faster tempo of game, opened up perimeter looks, and pushed the ball in transition.
While small-ball isn’t always successful, it can work when teams are able to rebound, play tough defense, hit perimeter shots, and push the pace of the game.
In its 67-62 victory over the Cal Golden Bears, Harvard rolled with a lineup of four perimeter players and 6’ 6” sophomore Jonah Travis. While the game was relatively close, the Crimson shot significantly better from deep (10 for 27 while Cal was 0 for 6), turned the ball over less (8 turnovers as opposed to Cal’s 13), and passed the ball better (13 assists to Cal’s 9). At the same time, the Golden Bear big men didn’t rebound or shoot particularly well—even with two to four inches of height advantage—and couldn’t take advantage of a soft Harvard interior defense.
With few traditional centers in the Ivy League, and its own lack of true center, the Crimson will likely look to transport its success from Haas Pavilion to Lavietes Pavilion against league opponents and continue to rely on hot shooting from wings like junior Laurent Rivard (40.4 percent from 3), freshman Siyani Chambers (47.8 percent), sophomore Wesley Saunders (49.6 percent), and senior Christian Webster (38.8 percent). Expect to see more perimeter-shooting derived from dribble penetration and ball movement as the winning recipe for the 2012-2013 Tommy Amaker crew.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
January 3, 1924: Physical Records Show Improvement
About 2,000 physical examinations were conducted by Dr. Roger I. Lee '02, Professor of Hygiene, and his assistants during the past year, and on the whole, the reports show a satisfactory undergraduate health record. Of these, of course, many were reexaminations, but those of the 903 incoming freshmen present some striking features.
For one thing the smoking habit does not seem to be so prevalent in the Class of 1927. Each year statistics have been collected in regard to the number of men who smoke, and although these figures may not be absolutely correct, they are at least comparatively accurate. 32.5 percent of this year's freshman class are smokers while the percentage in 1921 was 48 percent and in 1922 was 37 percent. There is probably some slight tendency to a decrease in smoking due to an increased participation in athletic exercises. In one of the graduate schools, 53 percent of the men smoke as compared with 54 percent in 1921 and 65 percent in 1922. At a rough estimate slightly over half of the College students are tobacco users by the time they graduate.
January 4, 1934: Beer, Ale Served in Dining Halls After 100 Years
Beer flowed legally in the dining halls yesterday for the first time in over 100 years. Two brands of beer and one of ale were offered to students over 21, seated at special tables. The Business School and Medical School were deprived however of the privilege because the University has not as yet procured a license for them.
This unprecedented action was the result of an announcement made December 20 by the Corporation that it would apply for licenses permitting the sale of malt beverages in the Houses. The Corporation's decision to apply for licenses followed long agitation that began last April when the 3.2 beer bill was passed and continued through to its climax some weeks ago when several students brought wine into the dining halls and some Houses voted in favor of having beer served.
January 5, 1943: Yardling Invents Face-Saving Mask
If a large enough market seems likely to present itself, a dazzlingly different type of headgear, practical and picturesque, may soon be manufactured on a grand scale by Glen O. Martin '46 of Joplin, Missouri, and Weld Hall. The new device which will soon be a must in every student's wardrobe, according to Martin, is called the Little Dandy Umbreller-Repeller, and really seems to be a marvel of simple efficiency.
Martin conceived the idea of his invention when, during a recent rainy spell, he found himself beset on all sides by determined females wielding the sharp points of their umbrellas with deadly efficacy, so much so, in fact, that he claims he was forced to cower for an hour in a convenient doorway till the rush hour passed. Fervently he wished for some sort of apparatus which would protect him reasonably well from the all too accurate thrusts of the parasol brigadiers, so when he arrived back at his little den in Weld he set to work on the plans of his brainchild.
January 5, 1956: Alumnus Quits Council, Objects to Oppenheimer
The Class of 1918's representative of the Harvard Fund Council has resigned in protest over the appointment of J. Robert Oppenheimer '26 as William James Lecturer for 1957.
Edwin Ginn '18, a Boston financier, insisted that he was "all for Harvard, but the atmosphere has undergone a change. There is tarnish on the Veritas today. The good name of the University is being used to disadvantage."
Ginn wrote David T. W. McCord '21, executive secretary of the Council, that the appointment of Oppenheimer, whom he called "a known Communist sympathizer and confessed liar in a matter of espionage," was "just too much," in his resignation letter of October 31.
January 4, 1966: HUC Demands Cliffies Be Kept Out of Lamont
The Harvard Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to oppose the administration of girls to Lamont. Library officials are considering abolishing the long-standing ban on Cliffies in the undergraduate library.
In a letter sent yesterday to the deans and to Merle Fainsod, director of the University Library, the HUC listed three arguments against the presence of Cliffies in Lamont.
First, the problem of space: Lamont seats only 1200 and is often overcrowded even without opening its doors to 1200 Cliffies. Daniel C. Goldfarb Jr. '66, chairman of the HUC, doubts that enough Harvard students would use the new Radcliffe Library to offset the overcrowding.
The HUC also fears a book shortage, since the library was designed for the 1200 Harvard undergraduates. Goldfarb doubts that a significant number of Harvard students would use the now Radcliffe Library, which will be completed next September.
