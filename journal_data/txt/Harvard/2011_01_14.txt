After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Old Quincy House will be the first of the 12 residential Houses to be overhauled, initiating the long-anticipated House renewal project, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced today.
The renovation of Old Quincy House, slated to begin shortly after Commencement in 2012, will allow planners to confront the design and construction issues they may face when renovating other Houses, according to the press release.
Announced in 2008, House renewal is an ambitious project that aims to dramatically overhaul the physical structure of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses.
Because Quincy contains two buildings, the neo-Georgian Old Quincy and the more modern New Quincy, planners will be able to test their renewal designs while impacting only some House residents.
Smith has said in the past that Houses with neo-Georgian architecture, which include six full Houses and portions of Quincy and Leverett, would receive priority when determining the order of renovations.
“We want to preserve the historic character and culture of the Houses while renewing the House life experience as a part of a 21st century approach to liberal arts education,” Smith said in the press release. “The Old Quincy test project allows us to do just that, informing guidelines for renewal across the Houses.”
During the renovation, which will require that the College close Old Quincy for 15 months, the approximately 180 students affected by construction will remain a part of the Quincy community and continue to eat in the New Quincy dining hall. They will be moved to a nearby “swing” space, which the press release said would potentially be owned by Harvard Real Estate Services.
According to Smith, the funding plan for the project will be presented to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, in the fall of 2011, and with their approval, construction will begin in 2012. The start date for the project has long hovered around 2012, but as recently as October, Smith did not offer a definitive start date during a Faculty meeting.
The architectural firm KieranTimberlake began surveying Old Quincy last summer and drew up tentative designs for the buildings. According to the release, renovation plans will be modified over the coming winter, and by spring, a committee will begin to look into the logistics of moving students to the “swing” housing and maintaining the integrity of the Quincy community.
The press release did not offer a timeline for the rest of the project, although it reaffirmed that the start dates of future construction would depend on availability of funding.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 35,000 students applied for admission to Harvard College’s class of 2015. This figure, which represents approximately a 15 percent increase over last year’s total, is the largest number of applications the College has received for an undergraduate class.
 
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 attributes the increase to a growing awareness of Harvard’s financial aid program and, to a lesser extent, to the ease of filing multiple applications online.
 
“The message that came through our [financial aid] initiative… was that if you’re a talented student and you need financial aid you should really think about going to one of the great private universities because they are no longer for the rich,” Fitzsimmons said.
 
Students whose families have a household income of less than $60,000 attend the College for free. Many families with incomes of less than $180,000 are asked to contribute no more than 10 percent of their annual income.
 
The effect of the financial aid program has been magnified by the economic issues of the past three years, Fitzsimmons said. He said that in past times of economic turmoil families have become more concerned with the quality of their child’s education and with its cost.
 
According to the Harvard Gazette, the increase in the number of applications from the South, Midwest, Mountain states, the Pacific region, and abroad were particularly notable. 
 
Fitzsimmons also said that the number of Latino and African American applicants has grown at a rate greater than the approximately 15 percent overall.
 
While many other universities have yet to release their application numbers, Harvard’s increase seems to follow the broader trend at highly selective universities.
 
The University of Pennsylvania and Dartmouth College both saw an increase in the number of applications of about 15 percent, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian and The Dartmouth. Stanford reported that its number of applications increased by approximately 7 percent.
 
Fitzsimmons said that while it was too soon to know how many students will receive acceptance letters in the spring, his office will be careful to limit the number of offers it extends and the size of its waitlist in order to avoid over-enrollment.
 
“We still have the same name number of beds available. That’s the non-negotiable number,” he said. “As we go through the process we’ll get a sense of what the climate is.”
 
Last year, 2,205 students were eventually offered admission to the College. Of that number 2,110 were initially accepted in April leading to a record low acceptance rate of 6.9 percent.
 
This year applicants will be notified of admissions decisions on March 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the sudden death of Susan Livingston—the longtime Cabot House administrator—earlier this week, students and colleagues say she will be remembered for a passion for theater, a gift for connecting with students, and dedication to the House.
Livingston, who was serving her 28th year as Cabot House administrator, died in an electrical fire in her apartment Tuesday. She was 64.
As House administrator, Livingston was responsible for coordinating House events, assigning student dorm rooms, and booking House spaces. But many members of the House community said that Livingston went beyond her duties to make students and affiliates feel welcome in the House.
“She really was kind of a pillar of Cabot House,” said Dustin M. Saldarriaga ’06, a former undergraduate in the House and a current resident tutor. “She really did embody what it meant to be a part of the House.”
A fan of theater, Livingston brought her love for drama to the House by starting the annual Cabot House Musical 19 years ago. Bringing together House residents and affiliates who did not always have theatrical backgrounds, Livingston, who directed and produced the musical each spring, cultivated their talents and put together a production within a matter of months.
Saldarriaga said he had only dabbled in theatre before college and had no intention of performing at Harvard until Livingston encouraged him to audition for a Cabot show.
“She brought it out of me,” said Saldarriaga, who has performed in every musical since moving to Cabot House as a sophomore in 2003. “Somehow, even though she was working with a lot of amateurs every year, she was able to put together something that you could enjoy.”
Livingston even made sure to include the House Masters in cameo roles.
Former Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris, who made his Cabot House musical debut as a Cuban waiter in “Guys and Dolls” seven years ago, said he remembered the professionalism with which Livingston directed the show, making sure that actors stayed after the final curtain call to help strike the set.
Livingston, who had a knack for convincing first time actors onto the stage, also knew how to bring out the best in her students.
Lacking theater experience, Richard R. Johnston, Cabot’s sophomore advising coordinator and fourth-year tutor, performed in the musical for the first time last year. He recalled watching Livingston interact with students during a rehearsal.
“As things were coming together, she would start glowing, and students would get excited by the positive feedback,” Johnston said.
“The musical showed how much she believed in the students,” said Saldarriaga. “The reason the musical turned out to be a good experience for us was that students that had oftentimes not been involved otherwise...were able to be a part of a production.”
Livingston also put on smaller performances where students could showcase juggling acts or their skill with the violin. Every December, she organized “Festivus,” a secular celebration inspired by the television show “Seinfeld.”
“She was the first one to be aware that there was so much talent in the House,” Saldarriaga said. “She was genuinely interested in students’ lives outside of class...she committed herself to bringing that out and showcasing that.”
Livingston was known to warmly welcome students into her office, sharing hot mulled cider and doughnuts with visitors every Thursday or by inviting students to borrow films from the House DVD library that she started and enthusiastically maintained.
At a place where students quickly come and go, Livingston was a source of continuity for students return, said Cabot House Resident Dean Jill Constantino. “She’s formed the community by being the strand that’s been there when people come and go.”
“She could talk about individual students going back 20 years—what rooms they lived in, what their favorite foods were,” said Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana, adding that Livingston “just had an encyclopedic knowledge” about the House.
Members of the House community congregated Thursday night for a private gathering in her memory. Cabot residents also collected cards expressing condolences for Livingston’s daughter Vanessa. The House has plans for a formal memorial.
“She's got such a big personality, and she's so full of life,” Constantino said. “There's this energy and excitement, and with her gone...that life that she filled the room with? We'll really feel it.”
“Cabot is not going to be the same,” Saldarriaga said.
Massachusetts and Somerville police and fire officials are still investigating the fire which occurred in Livingston’s home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Applicants who have family members who attended the school to which they are applying are approximately twice as likely to be admitted to highly selective colleges and universities than their non-legacy counterparts provided all other factors are equal, according to a study published in the Economics of Education Review this past December.
The study, which was conducted by Harvard Graduate School of Education doctoral candidate Michael D. Hurwitz, also found that chances of acceptance increase even more dramatically for students with a parent who attended the institution. These so-called primary legacies are seven times more likely than non-legacies to gain admission if all other factors are equal, the study found.
 
Hurwitz, who cannot disclose whether Harvard was one of the 30 schools that provided him with data, said that there were great variations between the numbers provided by each school.
 
Although his study finds an overall advantage for legacies, Hurwitz said he recognizes that the consideration of a student’s status as a legacy as part of a holistic approach to evaluating applications.
 
“[Because of] the quality of students applying to these colleges, it can be difficult to distinguish between students. It’s a small nudge that legacies are getting in most instances,” he said explaining how he believes legacy status is applied practically. “My findings don’t suggest at all that legacies are unqualified for admission.”
 
Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation and editor of Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions, said he believes the study supports his belief that legacies receive an unfair advantage in the college admissions process.
 
“The study provides further evidence that legacy preferences are not merely a feather on a scale which is only employed only in tie-breaking circumstances,” Kahlenberg said. “It suggests that in fact a preference can be quite significant.”
 
Pointing to a 2003 piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kahlenberg said that Harvard considers legacy status. According to the article, at that time 40 percent of Harvard legacies were accepted compared to 11 percent of applicants overall.
 
“Harvard is really at the center of this,” he said.
 
Hurwitz said that while legacy preferences mean a great deal to legacies who are applying for admission, they make little difference in the broader pool of applications because so few applicants are legacies.
 
According to Hurwitz, response from the participating schools has been positive as the study allows them to observe trends that they would not be able to see by analyzing their data alone.
 
As for the future of the legacy factor, Hurwitz said he believes the issue is up in the air.
 
“Sample colleges may feel that such an admission advantage is too big, too small, or just right,” he said in reference to the results of his study. “They may use the findings to reshape their policies.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 declined to comment on the study, stating that he needed more time to review its findings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might have taken a trip abroad, but the Crimson has proven that it is back on track.
The No. 6 Harvard men’s squash team traveled to Toronto's Canada National Squash Academy last night to take on No. 8 Western Ontario. Coming off two straight losses—against Cornell and Rochester, respectively—the Crimson squad bounced back in a resounding fashion with an 8-1 win.
Playing for the first time in over a month, Harvard (4-2, 2-1 Ivy) dominated against the Mustangs, picking up the team's first away match of the season. After dropping the first matchup of the night, the Crimson cruised and never looked back on its way to victory.
“It’s a huge win for us,” sophomore Alexander Ma said. “They’re ranked pretty high, and it was a good way to start off the second half of the season on a winning note. We were able to really come together as a team and realize our potential.”
Bruce Burrowes got Western Ontario off to a great start, defeating Harvard junior William Ahmed, but that was the last time the Mustangs tasted victory the rest of the night.
Burrowes won the first set easily, 11-5, but Ahmed took a tight second set, 11-9, to level the match at one set apiece. Ahmed couldn’t carry the momentum he gained from winning the second set forward. He lost the next two sets in similar fashion, 11-7 and 11-6, respectively, to give Western Ontario the early lead of the night.
“We knew going in it was going to be a tough match, but that didn’t really go affect our game plan of crushing them,” captain J. Reed Endresen said.
The highlight of the night came when Crimson senior Richard Hill battled from two sets down against Mustang Brian Hong. Hong controlled the first two sets of the match, giving up only seven points.
In the third and fourth sets, Hill turned the match on its head, taking both sets by identical scores of 11-7 and evening the match at two sets apiece. Hill pulled off what seemed to be the impossible, winning the last three sets to take the match 2-11, 5-11, 11-7, 11-7, 11-5.
That wasn’t the only comeback Harvard had under its belt, as the Crimson fought back from a set down in three more of its matches.
Harvard freshman Brandon McLaughlin dropped the longest set of the night, 15-13, to his opponent Ryan Herden but toughed out the next three sets to take the match 13-15, 11-8, 11-8, 11-4.
Scherl pulled out the win in a similar fashion, fighting back from an 11-8 loss in the first, but winning the next three sets in convincing fashion to defeat Adam Engel.
Crimson rookie Thomas Mullaney dropped the first set against Andrew Silvestri, 11-5, but won the next two sets easily. Silvestri posed a bigger challenge in the fourth set, but Mullaney won the last two points to close out the match, 12-10.
“We saw a lot of resilience within our team,” Ma said. “Outlasting the other opponent is a huge part of squash. If you can win the next three sets, after losing the first, hat’s off to you.”
With four comebacks in its pocket, Harvard continued its dominance and never gave Western Ontario a chance, powering past the Mustangs the rest of the night.
Endresen and freshmen Nigel Koh and Gary Power all had straight-set wins over their opponents.
Endresen fought through three tough sets, but in the end, he won the points that mattered, defeating Albert Shoihet 12-10, 11-9, 15-13.
Koh also had to battle past his opponent to secure a point for the Crimson. He came out of the first set victorious against his opponent Yeshale Chetty and then won a pair of sets to take the match.
Fellow freshman Power overcame a challenge from Kimesh Chetty, this time taking down the Mustang much more easily, 11-7, 11-7, 11-2.
After losing its first two matches of the season in early December, the Harvard men’s squash team needed a win to get the squad back on track for the rest of the year. And if the play the team displayed yesterday is any indication of its future performance, this might have been just the match it was looking for.

Paul A. Bowden '13, a neurobiology concentrator in Winthrop House, walked away with $16,250 after appearing as a contestant on "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" today.
Continuing the game that he started at the end of yesterday's episode, Bowden made it through a total of eight questions and accumulated $32,500 in his Millionaire Bank with no lifelines left.
The ninth question was from the category "Daisy Fresh":
According to Scientific American, flowers will stay fresh longer if they are put in water mixed with which of these drinks?
A: Beer
B: Coffee
C: Vodka
D: Milk
Unsure of the answer (the answer is C: Vodka), Bowden chose not to take a guess and walked away with half his Millionaire Bank—$16,250.
Under this season's rules, contestants who choose to walk away during Round 1 (questions 1 through 10) will get to keep half their Millionaire Bank. Once they advance into Round 2 (questions 11 through 14) and choose to walk away, they can keep the grand total in their bank.
Paul told "Millionaire" that if he won big on the show, he would buy a new laptop and pay for his schooling.
