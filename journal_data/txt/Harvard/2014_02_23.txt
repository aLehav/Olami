After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On Feb. 13, I joined a large crowd on the third floor of the Charles Hotel. Here at the Regattabar, a world-class jazz club, we waited for the 10 p.m. set by Dave Holland's newest ensemble, “Prism.” Led by Holland, a living legend on the stand-up bass, the ensemble features keyboardist Craig Taborn, guitarist Kevin Eubanks, and drummer Eric Harland.
The audience's excitement was apparent from the beginning. “I've seen the drummer before and heard some of Dave Holland's recordings, which were lovely,” said Carol. Alim, a guitarist at my table, told me, “I like his work with Miles Davis. That was a very special group.” While Holland first gained recognition with Davis in the late 1960s, he continues to lead a professional career that spans five decades.
 
After touring for two years and recording nine albums, Holland left Miles Davis' band. Over the decades he has performed with such luminaries as Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, Betty Carter, and Pat Metheny. In addition, “Prism” is his 20th album release as a leader. Of the other members, Eubanks led “The Tonight Show” band for 15 years, Taborn has recorded on over 70 albums as a sideman, and Harland garnered the excitement of every audience member I interviewed.
 
Herbie Hancock's impromptu arrival marked the peak of the audience's excitement. All eyes, some in disbelief, turned toward him as he entered. He greeted each of the band members with a hug before sitting down at a table amongst the rest of us. If Herbie, still in town after delivering his second Norton lecture, was excited to see Prism, we knew we were in for a worthwhile show. Consisting of four extended takes on original compositions, this set took the audience on quite the expressive journey. However, performing at a live venue granted the musicians a new sort of freedom. Improvisations stretched out over much longer periods of time as each musician developed the story he wished to tell.
Although many would simply label this group as “jazz,” the musical versatility of Dave Holland's “Prism" transcends any one label. “The Winding Way,” a Holland composition, slowly grew as Eubanks' guitar notes wound across the room before culminating in epic fashion with an explosive drum solo. At these moments, the show verged on the experimental as the group demonstrated the kind of “modern jazz” that one might expect from leading contemporary musicians. Contrastingly, their third tune, “The Empty Chair,” brought everyone to a much more familiar musical setting, featuring bluesy guitar and bass solos over a relaxed vibe.
 
Mr. Holland's decision to include this laid-back chart taught an important lesson. While his group may be known for erupting into complex grooves over obscure rhythms and odd-metered tempos, a return to the simple realm of the blues proved to be just as expressive. During each of their solos, Eubanks and Holland shut their eyes, deep in concentration, and one could sense their inner feelings flying out in each note.
 
The blues piece's contrast with the other three original tunes was reminiscent of Herbie Hancock's teachings. In his most recent Norton Lecture, he described his musical approach as “layering.” From the Miles Davis Quintet to his album “Head Hunters,” each style of music has formed a new layer in his musical experience. Holland has also adopted this approach; as he and Eubanks continued to tear it up, “blueing" notes over a progression that everyone recognized, they called upon past layers of music to complement the show’s more innovative work.
 
Through his performance, Dave Holland reminded the audience that music is a lifelong pursuit of endless possibilities. Almost 70 years old, he continues to push his boundaries by touring with some of the foremost younger players on the scene. After a 50-year career, “Prism” allows him to continue experimenting with the music he has mastered, introducing the world to new and innovative ways to play jazz.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Phantogram doesn’t like to rush things. Aside from releasing two EPs, the indie rock duo has stayed relatively quiet during the four years since “Eyelid Movies,” their last full-length album. Instead of hurriedly churning out a follow-up, they’ve opted to move behind the scenes and collaborate with a diverse assortment of artists. They worked with OutKast’s Big Boi on three tracks from his 2012 solo album, “Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors.” Then they were featured on “You Lust,” a track from The Flaming Lips’ 2013 album “The Terror.” And they’ve lent their music to everyone from MTV to The CW to the “Catching Fire” soundtrack.
Now the long wait for a second album is over, and with "Voices," Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter show off the fruits of their labor. The album exhibits a vast array of influences that they’ve been absorbing during their time off. At the same time, they double down on the aesthetic they’ve been cultivating for years. With "Voices," the duo breathes new life into their characteristic jagged beats and stargazing vocals and ensures the arrangements highlight the devastating songwriting rather than swallow it up, resulting in a bright, clear, and finely tuned sophomore album that pulses with life and energy.
 
Listening through the first three tracks is like listening to a three-part sonic history of the band’s progress over the past five years. Opener “Nothing But Trouble” has the grit and brooding atmosphere of the tracks on 2009’s “Eyelid Movies.” The second track, “Black Out Days,” lets in some fresh air with a snappy beat and a chopped vocal sample reminiscent of 2011’s breakthrough single “Don’t Move.” But “Fall In Love,” the third track, is something else entirely. A florid, deceptively off-tempo intro explodes without warning into a throbbing swirl of strings, synths, and soulful vocal samples, anchored by the biggest beat Phantogram has ever produced. It’s as instantly gratifying as anything in their catalogue, but it’s also suffused with a warmth and color that’s never been there before.
 
The rest of the record rises and falls in energy, effortlessly weaving together disparate textures and sounds without compromising this warmth. The humorously titled “Bill Murray” opens quietly with a single watery guitar but soon blossoms into a gorgeous, shimmering ballad embellished with rising clouds of hazy voices. “Bad Dreams” is a moody slow burner whose placid surface Barthel frequently shatters with piercing cries at the top of her register. And “Howling At The Moon” announces its arrival with an almost comical spaghetti-Western riff before taking off at full speed into its frenetic, clanging verses, with Barthel cooing the song title above the cacophony like a lovestruck werewolf. It’s even a bit playful, which speaks to Phantogram’s self-assuredness—they know how to have fun with their music without sacrificing any of its impact.
 
This clarity of vision enables the band’s songwriting to take center stage, revealing just how thoughtful and moving it’s been all along. Throughout their previous releases, Phantogram has written about heavy topics—depression, abandonment, isolation—from all angles, but especially from the viewpoint of the friend who’s helplessly watching their loved ones suffer. On “Voices,” they continue this approach, but with a better sense for when to get the music out of the way and let a choice lyric hit the listener between the eyes. Despite its title, “Fall In Love” is less about the spark of a new romance and more about the house fire that follows. Towards the end, as the beat falls away and the keyboards hover in empty space, Barthel hopelessly mourns, “The lines on my face ate away my smile / Could it be that I fell apart?”. Amidst the soft piano on the stunning closing track, “My Only Friend,” Barthel says the only thing she knows how to say to a lover who just wants to be alone: “I will wait outside / as long as you are alright.”
 
What makes “Voices” remarkable isn’t that it displays so much range or nuance—it’s that it does so without ever sounding like the work of anyone else. While the average boy-girl indie duo seems to fall somewhere between folk and synthpop, Phantogram has always taken their cues from grittier trip-hop—their drums skitter unevenly, their vocal samples echo from the walls like ghosts, and their songs sound like they were recorded in an outer-space cathedral. “Voices” doesn’t break from this tradition: the only difference is that they’re more confident, more willing to let the weirdness and sentiment shine through the gloom. After four years in the shadows, they’ve returned with a powerful statement of purpose that still stays true to the voices in their heads.

UPDATED: Feb. 24, 2014, at 12:57 a.m.
Donning his trademark hat and a velvet suit, LL Cool J said that receiving the Harvard Foundation’s Artist of the Year award at the 2014 Cultural Rhythms celebration should be a good omen for the rest of the year.
The Grammy Award-winning rapper, star of “NCIS: Los Angeles,” and champion of youth education was honored at Saturday’s festival by directors Aubrey J. Walker ’15 and Soyoung Kim ’14, as well as Neurology professor and Director of the Harvard Foundation S. Allen Counter, who was leading the ceremony for the 29th time.
“Each year we select, by student suggestion and vote and recommendation, a person to be honored as Artist of the Year, and this year, we’ve made a great choice,” Counter said.
LL Cool J took the stage amid cheers and applause from the packed audience in Sanders Theatre, gathered for a day-long celebration of diversity at Harvard. He told the crowd that he aimed to inspire students with lessons from his own journey.


“Me being here is representative of something truly magnificent about our country,” he said. “We have our disagreements, we have our problems...but ultimately, this is proof that if you have faith, if you work hard, if you believe, if you are determined, if you are adventurous, if you dedicate your life to being creative, if you truly have faith...you can become anything you want to become.”
 
He also stressed the importance of creativity, not only academically or artistically but also in creating “a great life.”
 
“You’re the architect of your fortune, so make sure the blueprint is right and build well,” he said.
 
Following LL Cool J’s opening remarks, the audience watched performances from a variety of music and dance groups, representing the cultural and ethnic diversity on Harvard’s campus, including Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán de Harvard, Harvard Bhangra, Harvard College Hellenic Society, and Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, among others.
 
LL Cool J emceed the afternoon’s festivities, and interviewed members of each ensemble after their performances, joking with students as he asked about their interests and the origins of each group—a role he likened to “the David Letterman of Harvard.”
During the show’s second act, LL Cool J donned a Harvard sweatshirt given to him by Walker and Kim.
Amid the audience’s laughter, LL Cool J said, “I love the sweatshirt. I can’t wait to rock it in a video.”
Counter presented him with the Artist of the Year plaque and praised the honoree as “an outstanding role model and symbol of excellence” in his commitment to educating young people.
Earlier in the day, LL Cool J had been toasted at a lunch in Kirkland House and the subject of a roast by the Immediate Gratification Players. The annual Cultural Rhythms Food Festival in the Science Center followed the Sanders program and showcased a variety of ethnic cuisines.
At the press event after the show, LL Cool J remarked that he was unprepared for the level of enthusiasm and talent Harvard brought to the stage.
 
“I didn’t expect to come and be inspired,” he said. “I feel inspired.”
LL Cool J joins the likes of Will Smith, Halle Berry, Matt Damon, and Shakira to have received the honor.

UPDATED: Feb. 24, 2014 at 9:20 p.m.
In an interactive, interfaith performance at Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall on Saturday night, seven Israeli and Palestinian musicians shared a message of peace through the only language that they said they all share–music.
The musicians were part of Heartbeat, an organization that unites Israeli and Palestinian youths and provides “opportunities for musicians from both sides to work together to build trust between their communities,” according to the group’s website. Heartbeat is on its third US tour, which culminates in a performance for the U.S. Congress in March. More than 100 young musicians have participated in Heartbeat programs, which include camps, master classes, and tours.
The performance, co-sponsored by Harvard Hillel, Divinity School, and the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program, was highly interactive. Audience members were encouraged to get on their feet and participate in music-making by clapping and singing along.
Bringing together three languages–English, Arabic and Hebrew–and various musical genres, the group’s original songs seek to convey a vision for hope and peace in the Middle East.
“What is the wall good for?” the group sang in “The Wall,” referring to the barrier separating Israel and the Palestinian West Bank.
“I’m convinced that the only way to solve [the Israeli-Palestinian] conflict is through enabling the two sides–who I see as fundamentally wanting the same things–to see and hear each other,” said Aaron Shneyer, a bassist from Washington, D.C., and the group’s founder. “Music is a powerful way to reach people and influence public opinion.”
Harvard’s contact with Heartbeat started when Law professor Robert C. Bordone, the director of HNMCP, and Divinity School student Adriel Borshansky met the group’s founders through Seeds of Peace, a peacebuilding organization based in New York City. Getzel Davis, associate rabbi at Harvard Hillel, also helped plan the concert.
 
“My job is to create a Judaism on campus that is an expression of what the students want,” Davis said.
 
The performers on Saturday, ages 18 to 23, came from diverse backgrounds both geographically and musically.
 
“It sounds crazy because some think we have this ‘difference,’ but we are family. We share a blanket,” Gefen said.
 
The concert featured a dialogue session during which the musicians answered questions from the audience. Addressing the political tumults in the Middle East, the percussionist Tamer Omari said, “What you are seeing here on stage is not the reality back home. I believe before we can co-exist, we must co-resist against the status quo of inequality and injustice.”
 
Many in attendance Saturday night said they reacted positively to the performance.
 
“Just seeing the two sides coming together making trilingual music is awesome,” said Leore C. Lavin ’17.
 Sasha Pippenger, a Harvard Law School student, agreed, saying that, “Harvard should do more to reach out to groups like this.”
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Feb. 24, 2014
An earlier version of this article misquoted Heartbeat founder Aaron Shneyer. In fact, he said that he sees the two sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as "fundamentally wanting the same things," not "fundamentally one and the same."

Actors Ian Somerhalder and Eloise DeJoria were among the crowd that filled Boylston Hall on Saturday afternoon to view the top films in the Girls Impact the World Film Festival, presented by the Harvard College Social Innovation Collaborative and Connecther.
In just its second year, the festival  aims “to give young student filmmakers a platform to voice their views and solutions for issues affecting women worldwide,” said Kerry V. Hammond ’14, who partnered with Ara N. Parikh ’15 and Connecther founder Lila Igram to organize the film festival.
The festival featured the three top films submitted by high school and undergraduate students from around the world. The three-to-five minute short films document global women’s issues, spanning from domestic violence to poverty.
The event began with a red carpet reception, where the student filmmakers and guests mingled over desserts and refreshments. The crowd then entered the Fong Auditorium for the screening of the top three films and an awards ceremony.
Filmmaker Abigail E. Disney, the festival’s keynote speaker, spoke about her experience documenting the plight of Liberian women to bring peace to their war-torn nation in her film "Pray The Devil Back to Hell." Disney also discussed her personal experience of the barriers to women in society.
 
“My dreams all had lids on them,” she said.
She asked the audience to think of how society would differ if women felt that they were welcome in political processes.
“Women don’t feel invited to the public square,” she said. 
Somerhalder, known for his role in the television series “Vampire Diaries,” served as one of the festival’s judges.
The grand prize winner, 17-year-old Kathryn Harhai, produced “Point B,” in which she broke her silence about the sexual abuse she suffered at the age of five.
In an interview, Harhai said that it was easier for her to express her feelings through a creative outlet.
“I’m hoping to share this film in the hopes that other girls will learn from my experience and have their voice be heard and not be a victim of the silence,” she said.
 
In her film “A Chance,” first runner-up Sarah Gale follows a 19-year-old woman from Colombia, who struggles with sexual abuse and drug addiction and fights to provide a safer future for her son.
 
Somerhalder stressed the increasing importance of female participation in society during a panel discussion, following the screening of the films.
 “The 21st century is the century where things will shift,” Somerhalder said. “This will be the century of the chick.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assuming the underdog role at No. 26 Clarkson last Friday, the Harvard men’s hockey team (9-13-4, 5-10-4 ECAC) managed to pull off an upset. Up against another ranked foe in No. 14 Yale (14-8-4, 9-7-3) this past Friday, the Crimson was not quite as fortunate.
In a rematch that drew several parallels to last month’s Rivalry on Ice contest at Madison Square Garden, the Bulldogs utilized a three-goal scoring outburst in the second period to top Harvard, 5-2.
“We were all getting pretty pumped up for this game,” freshman forward Alexander Kerfoot said. “It’s obviously always exciting to get [Yale], and it’s easy to get up for those games, so it’s fun. But we didn’t really bring it in all aspects of the game, and didn’t come out of the game with a win.”
Just like in January, the Crimson entered the first intermission even with the Bulldogs. But goals in the second frame from a trio of Yale sophomores—Stu Wilson, Matthew Beattie, and Ryan Obuchowski—helped build what proved to be an insurmountable lead.
Nonetheless, Harvard attempted to mount a comeback in the final stanza. After Bulldog forward Frankie DiChiara took away a breakaway opportunity from sophomore forward Brian Hart with a hook, the Crimson took advantage on the ensuing power play.
Surrounded by four Yale skaters, Kerfoot carried a puck over the blue line and fired a low shot that was stopped by the left blocker of Bulldog goaltender Alex Lyon. But the puck bounced right back out to the freshman, who capitalized on his second opportunity, cutting the deficit to 3-1 with 15:29 remaining.
Harvard finished the night two-for-four on the man advantage after Hart added a power-play goal of his own later in the period. But it was the special teams play of Yale that stole the show.
With nine minutes remaining in the contest, a cross-checking call sent Crimson forward Luke Esposito to the box. On the subsequent power play, Bulldog captain Jesse Root corralled a pass from forward Kenny Agostino and ripped a shot from the right circle past the glove of Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek, essentially sealing the win.
“We took a couple of needless penalties and weren’t able to do a good job killing their power play,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[That was] the difference in the game.”
Root’s score—the first of two for the senior—marked the third conversion of the night by Yale’s power play unit. Now having surrendered five such goals in its last two games, Harvard has fallen from third to 12th in the nation in penalty killing, currently boasting a 84.7 percent kill rate.
The Bulldogs began their work on the man advantage less than five minutes into the second period. Without much of an angle, Wilson unleashed a shot from the bottom of the right circle, but Michalek allowed just enough space on his left post for the puck to sneak through, as Yale took its first lead of the night.
All of the momentum then shifted in the Bulldogs’ favor. The Crimson had established a strong physical presence and had controlled the pace of play in the opening frame, but after falling behind, the team lost its edge.
“We had a little bit of a letdown after they scored the first goal,” Donato said. “The nature of it put us back on our heels a little bit.”
As aforementioned by Donato, Yale’s next score caught Harvard off guard. Midway through the period, freshman defenseman Clay Anderson lost his glove, so when play shifted to the opposite end of the ice, he skated toward the bench to retrieve it.
But at the same time, Bulldog defenseman Gus Young gained control of the puck and sent a long pass to Beattie who skated right through the vacant hole in the Crimson defense, easily beating Michalek on a breakaway.
Three minutes later, Harvard nearly cut the deficit in half. From his own blue line, Hart sent a cross-ice pass to sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey, who gained a step on a Yale defenseman and carried the puck in on Lyon. But Vesey lost control on the doorstep, and afterwards, the Crimson was whistled for a charging penalty behind the net.
As a result, the Bulldogs quickly capitalized on the power play again, as Obuchowski found a seam in the Harvard defense and notched his fourth goal of the season. Earning an assist on the play was Agostino, who now has 14 points in his career against the Crimson.
“We didn’t play smart enough to win the hockey game,” Donato said. “We got beat with special teams and goaltending, and that’s usually a tough recipe to overcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night where the Harvard men’s hockey team was looking for redemption, it instead found an ugly reminder of past troubles.
Looking to erase the memory of the team’s 5-1 loss at Madison Square Garden against Yale last month, the Crimson (9-13-4, 5-10-4 ECAC) was unable to skate with the Bulldogs (14-8-4, 9-7-3) for the duration of the game, losing control of the game in the second period and falling once again at the hands of its archrival, 5-2.
“We feel like if we’re rolling, we can eat up teams down low with our lines against any team in the country,” freshman forward Alexander Kerfoot said. “So that’s what we want to do. When we’re going, we’re going. Five-on-five, we can play with any team in the country, but we have got to bring it for sixty minutes of the game, and we didn’t have that tonight.”
Kerfoot’s power play goal with 15:29 left in the third frame sparked hope for Harvard, cutting the deficit down to two. But the Bulldogs’ three second-period goals in the span of 10 minutes proved too much for the Crimson to overcome.
MOMENTUM SWING
Harvard came into the matchup in Cambridge riding a four-game point streak and played the first period as such, generating several offensive chances in Yale’s defensive zone in the first 20 minutes of the game. A boarding penalty on the Bulldogs’ freshman forward John Hayden with the first period seconds from expiring seemed to swing momentum in the Crimson’s favor entering the second period.
But Harvard was unable to generate even one shot on the power play. Less than 90 seconds later, Yale found itself with a man advantage and was able to convert, giving the Bulldogs a lead that they would not surrender for the remaining of the contest.
“I just think that we didn’t play well enough,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We had chances, two breakaways [that we didn’t convert]… Between those and the power plays, that was the difference.”
POWER PLAY PROBLEMS
The Crimson entered Friday’s matchup boasting a penalty kill rate of over 90%, leading the ECAC and qualifying as the seventh-best rate in the NCAA Division I. But Yale was able to shred the Harvard special teams play, converting three out of four chances. Harvard had only given up 14 power play goals on the entire season before Friday’s tilt.
With junior defenseman Patrick McNally out on the night with a shoulder injury, the Crimson was hard-pressed to stop Yale’s man-advantage attack, which seemed calm and collected during its opportunities.
Bulldog forward Stu Wilson he fired a shot—from a seemingly impossible angle just inches from the goal line—that managed to find its away past Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek’s pads and into the back of the net for the first goal of the game.
Captain forward Jesse Root and sophomore defenseman Ryan Obuchowski were also able to register goals in special teams play,
After the night, the Crimson fell to third in the ECAC in penalty kill rate and out of the top 10 in the nation.
Harvard also had success on the power play on the evening, scoring its two goals on the man advantage.
Freshman forward Luke Esposito was hooked rushing towards the net with puck, drawing a minor penalty. Then, Kerfoot was able to break past the Yale defense and put a shot on net, collect his rebound, and slip the puck past the Bulldogs’ Alex Lyon outstretched right pad to end Yale’s hopes of a shutout.
Sophomore forward Brian Hart’s power-play goal with less than five minutes remaining gave Harvard its second goal on four power play attempts on the night.
NATIONAL CHAMPIONS COMMEMORATED
On a night where the defending national champions stole the show, the 1989 Harvard men’s ice hockey team was commemorated during the first intermission for its own title run 25 years earlier, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd at the Bright-Landry Center.
The MVP of the Frozen Four that year was none other than current Harvard coach Donato, who scored twice in the national championship game against Minnesota to help lead his team to a 4-3 overtime victory.
“Its great to see them,” Donato said. “I think the bond you have from winning a national championship is extra special. I think everyone on that team would be quick to tell you that it was not only a great experience winning, but winning with those guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—It was not the most exciting game that the Harvard and Princeton men’s basketball teams have played in recent years, nor did it have the most at stake—those honors go to the Tigers’ buzzer-beating win in the Ivy one-game playoff in 2011. But it would be hard to find a more intense matchup, as the league-leading Crimson (22-4, 9-1 Ivy) battled a Princeton team (15-8, 3-6) that, though it was out of the conference race, still clung tightly to its pride and to its 24-game home winning streak over its Cambridge rival.
And as the final seconds ticked down at Jadwin Gymnasium on Saturday night, the faces of the Harvard players wore expressions not seen in this building in a couple of decades: big, wide grins.
Carried by an improved second-half defensive effort and timely shooting from co-captain Brandyn Curry, the Crimson defeated the Tigers on the road for the first time since 1989, 59-47. The win also marks the first time in program history that Harvard has swept the season series against both Penn and Princeton.
“Those things will come back up, and when we get a chance to reflect on [them], they will have some bigger, greater meaning at some point,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Right now, we are thrilled about tonight, and we are hoping we came out healthy.”
In the early going, Princeton showed why it was so tough to beat on its home floor, threatening to blitz the Crimson off the court. Perhaps flustered by the charged atmosphere, Harvard committed six turnovers in the first 10 minutes, and, over one stretch that lasted nearly nine minutes, did not score a single point.
“I kind of lit into our guys there, to be very honest, and I was disappointed that [the Tigers’] energy and their fight was greater than ours and our competitiveness at that point in time,” Amaker said. “In a lot of ways, I challenged our guys, and I am thrilled they responded the way they did. I am not surprised. There is a lot of pride on this team [and] in our locker room.”
Harvard responded to Amaker’s words with an 8-0 run to cut the deficit, which was once as large as 12, to a manageable five points at intermission. The Crimson sustained its momentum into the first few minutes of the second period. Two baskets from senior forward Kyle Casey and one from sophomore guard Siyani Chambers tied the game at 30 with 16:18 to play.
From there, the Crimson offense was keyed by Curry, who scored 12 of his team-high 17 points in the second half. In his final attempt at a win in Jadwin, the Huntersville, N.C. native hit two critical threes in the final 20 minutes, and seemed to be the one of the only Harvard players at ease shooting against the domed backdrop of Jadwin.
“[In practice], we expressed to [the underclassmen] how meaningful it was [to win at Princeton],” Curry said. “This is our last go-around, and the seniors before us did the same thing. You realize how much it means to you when you are there.”
A Princeton three-pointer brought the Tigers to within three with 6:16 to play, but the home squad would get no closer. Kicked off by a three from junior wing Wesley Saunders, the Crimson went on an 11-0 run that sealed the final result, with a smiling Chambers dribbling out the clock.
Princeton’s offensive execution deserted it during the Harvard surge. The Crimson locked down on the Tigers’ back-cutting offense, which had been executed effectively in the first half, holding Princeton to 26.1 percent shooting in the second frame. Tiger forward Hans Brase, who had 20 points in the squads’ first matchup this season, finished with three points on 1-of-8 shooting.
“Our normal way of guarding is to get out and pressure,” Amaker said. “That is the calling card of our program, but we need to adjust sometimes, and our adjustment there served us well to pull back and keep [cutting players] in front.”
The win moves the Crimson into sole possession of first place in the Ivy League—at least for 24 hours. Yale, currently sitting in second, has a chance to tie Harvard atop the standings with a win at Columbia on Sunday afternoon.
Entering the game with five conference losses, pride was, practically speaking, about the only thing that the Tigers were playing for. That pride was on full display on Saturday night in the raised arm of freshman guard Spencer Weisz after hitting a late three, in the raucous response from the student section, and even in the postgame media room. When asked if the winning streak over Harvard was something he had brought up to his players, Princeton coach Mitch Henderson’s response was terse: “Never.”
For the Crimson, the win means a sigh of relief and one less annual storyline about which it will have to answer questions.
“I’ve heard [the streak was] 30, I didn’t know what it was,” Amaker said. “It seemed like it had been 100.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 377 years, Harvard has seen nearly everything. Nearly, because coach Tommy Amaker and the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-4, 9-1 Ivy) continue to add new lines to the Crimson record books.
Saturday’s 59-47 win against Princeton (15-8, 3-6) at Jadwin Gymnasium marked the first time in history that Harvard has gone 4-0 in the season series against Penn and Princeton. The Killer P’s, whom Amaker called the “gold standard” of Ivy League basketball on Friday night, were outscored by 68 points across the four meetings.
At Jadwin, where the Crimson had not won in 24 tries, Harvard fell behind by double digits early but battled back behind a suffocating defense. Princeton shot 26 percent in the second half, totaling eight turnovers and just four assists. Forwards Will Barrett and Hans Brase combined for 25 points when the squads played in Cambridge. On Saturday, however, the two contributed only three points on 1-of-15 shooting.
STANDING TALL
Prior to the game, Princeton coach Mitch Henderson made several adjustments to his team’s lineup in hopes of congesting Harvard’s passing and driving lanes. Freshmen Spencer Weisz and Steven Cook were named starters, giving the Tigers extra size on the wings. With the rookies in the lineup, Princeton’s starting five had an average height of 6’6”.
For twelve minutes, it worked. When a Pete Miller three-point play put the Tigers up 12 with eight minutes to go, the Crimson had nearly as many turnovers—eight—as points--nine.
And then the two shortest players on the court took over.
Harvard’s two point guards—6’0” sophomore Siyani Chambers and 6’1” co-captain Brandyn Curry—had eight points in a 15-8 Crimson run to close the gap to five. Early in the second half, the pair combined for five points in a 7-0 burst that gave Harvard its first lead since the opening basket of the contest.  Princeton didn’t get closer than one the rest of the way.
For the game, the two guards combined for 30 points and nine assists, turning the ball over just four times. They were 6-of-6 at the line in the final seconds as Harvard scored 13 of the contest’s final 17 points.
“It was definitely a special moment for me,” Curry said. “I grew up an hour away from here…. That definitely ma[de] it special for me and it made the victory even more special when we won.”
MOUNDOU-NO-MISSI
With Curry and Chambers struggling out of the gate, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi kept the Crimson within striking distance early with efficient post play. Moundou-Missi made all five of the shots he took on the night—four of which came in the first half—beating a variety of Tiger defenders down low.
Moundou-Missi finished with 11 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks, including a swat of a Brase dunk attempt. With senior Kyle Casey in foul trouble, the junior did the bulk of the work inside on Brase and Barrett. In the second half, with Moundou-Missi playing nearly every minute, Princeton had just four points in the paint.
“A tremendous effort out of Steve,” Amaker said. “For him to be able to play those kind of minutes and not be in foul trouble…I’m very pleased with that.”
STAYING THE COURSE
With Moundou-Missi warding off the paint, it was up to the Crimson perimeter defenders to run the Tigers off the three-point line. While the team as a whole held Princeton to just 33 percent shooting from downtown, the toughest mark—T.J. Bray, the league leader in points and assists—fell to junior wing Wesley Saunders.
Saunders, who led the conference in scoring last season, had a quiet night on the offensive end, tallying seven points and two assists. But his defense on Bray was crucial for the team’s late-game run.
Bray made just 3-of-8 shots in the second half. After nailing a three with 9:21 remaining to bring Princeton within one, the senior did not score until there was just 43 seconds left on the clock. On the night, Saunders took the opposing senior’s playmaking ability out of the game, holding him to just two assists.
“I put a lot on Wesley’s shoulders, and we all demand and expect a lot from him,” Amaker said. “For Wesley to have to challenge [Bray] all over the floor and be locked in on every possession is hard, and I am sure that took its toll somewhat on the offensive end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just under two minutes to play, Raphael Girard stepped off the ice to make room for an extra attacker. He will not know for another week whether that play will be his last at home, but Saturday’s final score has the odds stacked against Harvard and the senior goaltender.
On Senior Night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, 30 saves from Bears freshman goaltender Tyler Steel lifted the Brown men’s hockey team to a 2-0 win over the Crimson. A pair of goals in the middle frame from sophomore forward Nick Lappin and senior defenseman Jake Goldberg gave the Bears the separation in the conference standings that they were looking for.
Harvard (9-14-4, 5-11-4 ECAC) entered the evening one point behind the visitors for the coveted eighth spot in the conference standings.  ECAC teams that finish fifth through eighth in the conference receive home ice in the ECAC Tournament’s best-of-three opening round, which decides the schools that will face the conference’s top four regular season finishers in the quarterfinals.
“We want to play at home, so this was a huge game,” Brown coach Brendan Whittet said. “Playoff game type of mentality.”
Brown (11-13-3, 8-11-1) is now in control of its postseason fate, and wins by St. Lawrence and Dartmouth this weekend have helped push the Crimson to 11th place in the league. Harvard, which also lost to Yale, 5-2, on Friday, will now need to sweep Colgate and Cornell on the road and get help from a few other teams next weekend for another shot at playing under the Bright lights this season.
Harvard carried the play early and had several good looks in the first period against Steel, who skated away with the first shutout of his collegiate career. Sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo created a near-2-on-0 opportunity with classmate Greg Gozzo up the left wing late in the frame, but the freshman goaltender kicked Criscuolo’s attempt aside.
“I thought in the first period [Harvard] took it to us really [well], and that’s where they had a lot of possession and a lot of good opportunities in that first period,” Whittet said. “I thought as the game wore on we settled into it a bit more and we were much more intelligent about what we did.”
The Bears quickly snuffed out any momentum that Harvard carried into the locker room. Crimson freshman forward Tyler Moy was whistled for holding 25 seconds into the second frame, and Brown struck moments later off the next draw in the Harvard zone. Sophomore center Mark Naclerio won the faceoff and sent a cross-crease pass to classmate Lappin, who lifted the puck over Girard’s left shoulder for the first goal of the game.
Harvard again controlled the pace for much of the period. The home team attempted 26 shots to Brown’s six in the middle frame, but a strong Bear blocking corps helped keep Steel perfect.
“I thought we played the majority of the game in their zone,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think [Brown] did a good job at blocking shots and having sticks and bodies in shot lanes.”
The Bears broke through on offense again with just over three minutes left in the frame. From the right point, Goldberg launched a shot that appeared to change direction through traffic on its way past Girard, with Lappin perhaps getting a piece of it for his second strike of the night. An official review, however, credited Goldberg with his second goal of the season.
The goal all but sounded the death knell for the home team. Harvard is now 0-11-1 when trailing after two periods this season.
In the third, Brown put the clamps on the Crimson for the most even 20 minutes of the game. Harvard freshman forward Alex Kerfoot challenged Steel in the crease during 6-on-5 play in the final minute, but the rookie could not get the elevation on the puck that he needed.
After the final horn, Harvard lined up on the blue line to recognize Girard and the three other graduating seniors. Donato was pleased with the team’s work on the ice on Saturday night, which he compared favorably to the team’s unbeaten performance at St. Lawrence and Clarkson last weekend, but it will now take something special to get the squad back to the Bright.
“I had no issue with our effort,” Donato said. “Our execution on things certainly can and needs to improve, but I thought our guys played hard and did a lot of the things we needed to do to give ourselves a chance to win.... I told them to keep their head up, and we’ll go back at it next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s opening contest of its 2014 campaign, the Crimson ran into a brick wall offensively against No. 14 UMass and eventually succumbed in the low-scoring contest.
Harvard (0-1) was able to keep the score close, but the Minutemen were eventually able to separate and run away with the victory, 8-4.
“UMass outplayed us,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik '96 said. “We went toe-to-toe for awhile, but a combination of fewer possessions and us not being sharp offensively was the difference. It was a slow game, and [UMass] did a good job controlling it.”
Scoring came at a premium throughout the match as vast stretches of the game went by without either team notching a goal. After Minuteman senior Connor Mooney scored just 1:28 into the game, the match continued scoreless for nearly 10 minutes until Harvard senior midfielder and captain Peter Schwartz found an answer.
“Our defense played very well,” Wojcik said. “Our goalie, Jake Gambitsky, had a strong game in goal for us too. We just struggled offensively.”
Three minutes later, UMass defenseman James Fahey was able to score off of a successful clear, assisted by attackman Grant Whiteway, to end the quarter. His goal was followed right after the restart by freshman attackman Nick Mariano, who scored his team-leading seventh goal of the year to put UMass up, 3-1.
Another nine scoreless minutes passed before the Crimson could bounce back to tie the game. Sophomore midfielder Brendan Newman answered first, assisted by classmate Sean McDonagh. Sophomore attackman Ian Ardrey added another score to tie up the contest, assisted by Schwartz, with only five seconds left in the half.
Harvard came out in the second half looking to ride the momentum from its late goal but was forced to watch its offense stall for the remainder of the contest. UMass’s offense could not find the back of the net for the first 13 minutes of the quarter, but the team picked up a pair of scores when Mariano and classmate Grant Consoletti scored in quick succession to end the third quarter.
“Every year the offense always takes a little longer to come along,” Schwartz said. “Its more about chemistry and playing together. We have a lot of new guys in different spots, but we do have all the pieces.”
Only a minute into the fourth quarter, the Minutemen landed the finishing blows, as attackmen Andrew Sokol and Whiteway scored two goals within a span of five seconds. UMass dominated the faceoff matchup throughout the course of the match, going 9-for-11 in the first three quarters and 11-for-16 for the entire game. Whiteway’s goal was a direct result of a quick win by faceoff midfielder Joe Calvello, an advantage that was instrumental to the Minutemen’s success.
“They were able to get a couple goals and transitions, and just maintain a lot of possessions,” Wojcik said. “We tried a number of different options, but their faceoff guy is very good… and I think that put them in positions to score goals. Overall, that was a big part of the game.”
Schwartz and Mariano would each add another goal before the game finished, both eventually leading their respective teams with three points for the game. In UMass’s three contests to date, Mariano has scored four, two and three goals, respectively.
Despite the close score at the start, the Crimson was outperformed in many important aspects of the game by its opponent. In addition to being dominated in the faceoff fight, Harvard struggled in the groundball battle. The Minutemen were able to claim 27 groundballs to the Crimson’s 13.
“I thought we played really well in 6-on-6 defense and offense,” Wojcik said. “It was really the transition and faceoff goals that hurt us.”
Harvard gave up 14 turnovers, 12 of them being forced by UMass defensemen, while the Crimson defense caused only 4 such turnovers. Harvard also failed on all three of its extra-man opportunities.
“Our organization just needs to continue to improve going forward,” Schwartz said. “If our defense keeps playing the way it that they played all season, then the offense will definitely come along.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team got off to a slow start on Friday, dropping seven of its first eight matches on the road against Columbia. The Crimson (4-7, 3-7 EIWA) rallied to win its last two matches but ultimately suffered a 33-10 defeat at the hands of the Lions (7-6, 4-5 EIWA) at the University Gym in New York.
Injuries again played a key role for Harvard, who entered the match without its starters at both 165 lbs. and 174 lbs. As if that were not tough enough to overcome, co-captain Cameron Croy sustained a concussion at 184 lbs., forcing him to injury default out of the match. The Crimson surrendered six points in each of those matches, results that ended any possibility of a Harvard comeback.
Crimson sophomore Brennan Smith, filling in at 165 lbs., was pinned by senior Josh Houldsworth with 39 seconds remaining in the second period while Columbia junior Shane Hughes pinned senior Ian Roy just one minute into his match at 174 lbs.
Harvard coach Jay Weiss acknowledged the injuries but refused to use them as excuses.
“Obviously, we had a couple of guys out,” Weiss said. “But I still thought we were going to do a better job in the middle of the lineup. We came off one of our best matches last Saturday against Brown, and we just didn’t follow it up.”
The Crimson was seeking to put together back-to-back dual meet wins for the first time this season after soundly defeating Brown on the road, 30-10.
Junior co-captain James Fox, who won his match against junior Max Idelson at 197 lbs., echoed his coach’s disappointment after the loss.
“Columbia is a solid team,” Fox said. “But we definitely underperformed, from top to bottom.”
The overall tone for the match was set from the outset, as senior Penn Gottfried opened the contest with a 16-0 tech fall over junior Max Mejia at 125 lbs. After that, Harvard lost two tight matches. Sophomore Jeffrey Ott led Lions sophomore Angelo Amenta at 133 lbs. before dropping a 6-2 decision, while Crimson sophomore Nicholas Stager went down to the wire against junior Ryan Ponte but could not prevail in a 3-2 decision at 149 lbs. Harvard proceeded to lose its next four matches, a stretch that included the three matches impacted by injury.
Weiss felt that problems arose for his wrestlers in pressure situations.
“They’re working hard, but there are certain things that we want to key into,” Weiss said.  “Some of the guys are quick to deviate from what we’ve gone over.”
Despite Harvard’s struggles as a team against Columbia, Fox and sophomore Todd Preston continued their run of strong performances in dual meets this season. Both picked up wins for Harvard on Friday, improving their records to 9-2 and 9-1, respectively, in dual meets.
Fox earned a major decision over Idelson by a score of 11-3, while Preston battled through a tight match against senior Matt Bystol to record a 2-1 overtime win at 141 lbs.
The win was the seventh in a row for Fox, while Preston’s win made it five straight for the sophomore.
With one dual meet left, Fox praised his teammates’ attitude and performance this season.
“[Preston] has been wrestling really solidly,” Fox said. “He just hand fights really hard and has been relentless.”
Junior David Ng recorded the only other win for the Crimson, notching at 5-3 decision over freshman Michael Fetchet at heavyweight.
As the team heads toward the postseason, both Fox and Weiss have a strong idea about what they need to focus on. Fox highlighted endurance, mental toughness, and intensity as important for the team’s success heading down the stretch, while Weiss stressed the need for all 10 wrestlers to peak at the right time in order to perform at their best during the postseason tournaments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The honors just seem to keep coming for Crimson sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers. The Golden Valley, Minn. native, who is the defending Ivy League Rookie of the Year, can now add Bob Cousy Award Finalist to his resume. Chambers was also named to the All-Ivy League First Team as a freshman and to the Great Alaska Shootout All-Tournament team this past November
The Bob Cousy Award is given every year to the top collegiate point guard in the nation. Chambers is one of 23 finalists and joins players such as Preseason All-American Marcus Smart of Oklahoma State, Shabazz Napier of UConn, and UMass Amherst’s Chaz Williams.
The sophomore guard has led Harvard to an impressive 20-4 start and a tie for first atop the Ivy League standings with a 7-1 record conference record. Along the way, Chambers has averaged 11.2 points, 4.3 assists and 1.3 steals while playing 34.7 minutes per game. These number rank him second in the Ivy League in assists and third in both steals and minutes played per game.
The sophomore becomes just the third Ivy League point guard to be named a finalist for this award, joining Penn’s Zach Rosen and former Crimson point guard Jeremy Lin. Both players were seniors when they were named finalists, making Chambers the first underclassman to become a Cousy award finalist from the Ivy League.
Fans can vote online through March 10 in order to determine five finalists to be presented to the Hall of Fame Selection Committee. After the winner is elected, they will be presented as part of the NCAA Final Four weekend. Past winners include Kemba Walker, Ty Lawson and last year’s winner, Trey Burke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first home games of its 2014 campaign, the Harvard women’s water polo team (7-2) was able to build on its winning record behind strong performances from younger players. After dropping the first Saturday contest to Wagner, the Crimson came back with three straight wins against Sienna, Villanova, and Iona to close out the weekend.
HARVARD 13, IONA 7
In the third match up between the two teams this season, the Crimson sealed the sweep of the series behind a dominant offense.
Previously, both games against Iona had gone into overtime, but Harvard was able to put Sunday’s game away in regulation.
“We’ve always known we’re the better team, and the times we’ve gone into overtime, we let them come back and let them hang around with us,” freshman Michelle Martinelli said. “This time we had the mindset that we weren’t going to let them do that, and we were successful.”
The Crimson started the game off steadily with a 4-1 lead towards the end of the first quarter. But before the half was over, the Gaels scored three goals to bring themselves within one at halftime.
Late in the third quarter, Iona had the opportunity to tie the game at seven off of a steal, but a block from sophomore Yoshi Anderson allowed the Crimson to maintain its lead and momentum in the game.
For the remainder of the match, Harvard fended off the Gaels’ offense and went on a 6-1 run to earn the victory.
“You see an improvement from two weeks ago to where we are today,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We came back from Princeton, we trained really hard, and we worked on some things. And the things we worked on to try and get better, we did [improve].”
HARVARD 14, VILLANOVA 7
After a game that began 1-1, Harvard pushed forward and went on a 7-0 run, leading, 8-1, with less than five minutes left in the first half.
“I think our five-on-six percentage was better, I think we did a better job on our drive defense, and we minimized the number of times we got ejected,” Minnis said.
In a play that cemented the Crimson’s lead, Anderson went one-on-one against the Wildcat goalie and was able to bounce a shot into the back of the net, putting Harvard up, 11-2.
Villanova did not give up towards the end of the first half, outscoring the Crimson, 5-3, down the stretch. A blocked shot by freshman Lexi Del Toro aided Harvard’s ability to seal the victory and come out on top.
HARVARD 19, SIENNA 8
In its second game on Saturday, the Crimson came out strong offensively, leading the game by three goals at the end of the first period.
The offensive domination continued into the second stanza of the match, where Harvard scored five unanswered goals.
“[Scoring 19 goals means] we’re going to get better,” Minnis said. “We’re a young team with five upperclassmen and 10 freshmen and sophomores in this group, so we’re a new team with a mix of experience and some young ones, so it’s still going to be a growing process.”
The Crimson saw offensive contributions from up and down the roster. Freshman Melissa Balding led the pack with four goals. Matinelli and senior Shayna Price both netted three, while junior Kalina Grabb and Del Toro each scored twice.
HARVARD 11, WAGNER 12
In its first game of the tournament, the Crimson faced the team that had handed Harvard its only loss of the season thus far. When the Crimson matched up against Wagner at the Princeton invite on Feb. 9, the team fell, 11-8, to the Seahawks.
This time, the game went down to the wire.
Tied at two goals apiece at the beginning of the first quarter, Harvard was able to score three goals, but each was matched by a Wagner player.
In the final minute of the first half, the Seahawks made a quick pass to the corner of the goal, and a shot by sophomore Jess Lundgren put Wagner up going into the half.
“We matched their physicality,” Minnis said. “We talked about how they were going to be physical…. That’s their style, and unless you’ve played against that, you don’t know what to expect, and I think [last time] we got caught on our heels. This time we knew what to expect.”
Wagner outscored the Crimson in the final frame of the match, 5-3, ultimately giving the Seahawks the edge.
Price led Harvard in scoring with five goals in the game. Sophomore Rachel Lobato had two steals, while classmate Charlotte Hendrix tallied three steals.
Junior Ariel Dukes made 10 saves in the loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After Harvard came out on the winning side of a narrow 5-4 match against Trinity just two weeks ago, it was no surprise to anyone that it took another nailbiting finish between the two teams to determine a winner at the College Squash Association’s National Women’s Team Championships.
 
This time, however, the Crimson (14-1, 7-0 Ivy) fell just short in its bid for a third straight national title. Top-seeded Harvard lost to the Bantams, 5-4, in a whirlwind match that saw four contests go to five games and came down to the last match to crown a national champion. After going undefeated in the regular season, the defeat in the finals marked Harvard’s only loss this year.
 
“We have no regrets,” co-captain Natasha Anzik said. “We had some really good matches. Trinity’s a really good team, and I think we rose to the challenge and played really well. That’s really all you can ask for, just to give it your best.”
 
TRINITY 5, HARVARD 4
A year after Harvard defended its 2012 title with a 5-4 win over the Bantams, Trinity flipped the script with a 5-4 win of its own. The victory gave the Bantams its third national championship, and first since winning back-to-back titles in 2002 and 2003.
 
After wins by junior Amanda Sobhy and freshman Dileas MacGowan helped Harvard crawl out of a 4-2 deficit and tie the match up at four wins apiece, all eyes turned to the one match still in progress. Sophomore Saumya Karki went up with a win in the first set, but Trinity freshman Anna Kimberley calmly worked her way back to take a 2-1 lead.
 
With alternating cheers of “Let’s go, Anna!” and “Let’s go, Saumya!” echoing through Jadwin Gymnasium at Princeton, Kimberley and Karki started what would become the decisive game. The two traded points back-and-forth, but after a Karki boast missed its mark, Kimberley took an 8-5 lead that would prove insurmountable.
 
A kill from Kimberley later in the game gave her a 10-8 advantage and two match ball opportunities. Despite a strong shot from Karki to close the lead to one point, Kimberley held on and took the fourth set, 11-9, to win the game, the match, and the national title for the Bantams.
 
“We had played Trinity before and beaten them,” Anzik said. “If everyone had played the same today, we would have won, so I think that put a lot of pressure on the girls who did win last time. Today Trinity was just very mentally tough, they had some great matches, and they outplayed us on the day.”
 
Trinity went up 4-2 after junior Ashley Tidman beat Harvard sophomore Michelle Gemmell in five games. Gemmell started strong, going up, 2-0, but could not keep up as Tidman cruised through the last three games to give Trinity the point at the seventh position.
 
With the remaining three matches must-wins for the Crimson, Sobhy left nothing to chance in the No. 1 spot. The junior breezed through her match, sweeping Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy to give Harvard another point in the win column. MacGowan followed up Sobhy’s victory with a five-game win of her own to even the match up, 4-4.
 
The Crimson started the match off well, getting two quick wins from sophomore Katie Tutrone and junior Megan Murray to go up, 2-0, early. Harvard’s other losses came at the second and eighth positions from junior co-captain Haley Mendez and senior Isabelle Dowling, respectively.
 
HARVARD 6, YALE 3
 
Ten days after a 7-2 win over Yale clinched the Ivy title for the Crimson, Harvard once again powered past its historic rivals to make its way into the national title match.
 
Four of the Crimson’s six wins came in straight sets, with the deciding win coming from Gemmell in the fifth spot. The sophomore clinched Harvard’s spot in the finals with an 11-9, 11-6, 11-7 win over Yale’s Jenny Scherl. Sobhy and Mendez led the way in the top two spots, sweeping both of their matches in straight sets.
 
HARVARD 9, DARTMOUTH 0
 
The Crimson started its quest to defend last year’s national title with a perfect 9-0 sweep of eighth-ranked Dartmouth. It was the third time this season that Harvard swept the Big Green.
The Crimson had perfect 3-0 wins in eight of the nine matches to advance to the semifinals, with the only dropped games coming in Isabelle Dowling’s 3-2 victory over Dartmouth’s Tori Dewy.

As the NFL season drew to a close last month, so did the Harvard football team's chance to sit back and watch Monday Night Football every week. In its place, a new weekly ritual has taken over for a few of Harvard's athletes: The Monday Night Bachelor Viewing Party. Every Monday, two football players and a soccer player gather to engage in stimulating discussions as they watch Juan Pablo’s weekly search for love on The Bachelor.We interviewed “The Bachelor" enthusiasts Michael D. Hirsch ’14, William G. “Vas” Giahos ’14, and Cameron M. Brate ’14 to find out a little more about their TV habit.Flyby:  How did you guys first get into The Bachelor?MH: “I have two sisters and they always watched The Bachelor…so I started watching it kind of secretly in my room last year, and then Cam, my roommate, walked in, and he sat down and started watching and then we talked about it together as we were going to class."WG: “We all just watched it separately and then [Michael and Cameron] were always watching it in their room and I said "Oh, I watch it too." And then it became a thing on Monday nights.”CB: “When we first got started, it was actually all Mike. For whatever reason, he was a big fan of the show, and then he started watching it on the TV and we only have one TV in our room so I started watching The Bachelor and I kind of got hooked.”Flyby:  What do you guys do at your Bachelor viewing party?CB: “Oh, at the parties, it starts off where we light some candles to kind of set the mood a little bit, open a bottle of nice white wine, and then we have chocolate fondue set up. Then this is at six so this is two hours before so we pre-game it. And then we lock the door at eight, no guests, no talking, no phones. We want to give a natural organic viewing experience. So next week we’re pretty excited because it’s two nights, both Monday and Tuesday for a Tuesday Night Special.”MH: “It’s pretty meaty. There will be guys like stretching, doing work-outs and stuff. A lot of protein.”Flyby: What are your thoughts on Juan Pablo?WG: “He’s a phenomenal dude. Such a great accent. I’m a soccer player myself so I dig that. He seems a pretty nice guy. He’s coming on emotionally now which is nice to see, you know he’s just trying to find love.”CB: “You know to be honest, not a big fan of Juany P. It’s just the language barrier, he struggles with the language a little bit. He’s a very suave guy so no disrespect, can’t hate on him.”Flyby: What are your thoughts about the season so MH: “It’s obviously really fun to watch. We’re a little disappointed in the fact that Juan hasn’t built any serious relationships with anyone yet. He’s just kind of kissy with all of the girls.WG: “It’s been a good season. It feels like it’s been a quick season to tell you the truth. It flies by.”Flyby:  Who do you think is going to win Juan Pablo’s heart?MH: “I really like Andi the best, she’s our favorite. We’re rooting for Andi right now. She’s smart and strong and a good match for Juan.WG: “Mike Hirsch’s pick who he thought was going to go all the way dropped out on the last episode so he was pretty upset."Flyby: “Wait, we thought he liked Andi?"WG: “He liked Sharleen before her, and she left so he was like "Aw man!" and now he likes Andi. Cam is for Andi and I’m also for Andi but I’m also for Nikki.”CB: “Mike was the big Sharleen fan, so he was pretty devastated when she left last episode. There was a lot of drama. But I agree with Juan, she wasn’t the right match. I’m rooting for Andi, she’s great, love her. I hope she wins.”Flyby: Is this your guilty pleasure or are you loud and proud about watching The Bachelor?MH: “I’m loud and proud about it. But the other guys, it’s definitely a guilty pleasure.”WG: “I don’t know if I’d say I’m loud and proud about it. I definitely don’t go around advertising it, but I’m not ashamed of it.”CB: “It’s definitely a guilty pleasure, I’m not that loud and proud about it.”Flyby: Have you ever wanted to be on the show?MH: “No, just because I would probably end up saying something corny.”WG: “Yeah, I thought about it. I guess it’s just not really my thing. I don’t think I can take all the controversy and emotions--it’s just too much to handle. No doubt I’d be good at it though.”CB: “I think my buddy Vas would be a great bachelor. He’s kind of got that all-American personality and you’d think he’s really smooth--he’s not that smooth but that kind of aspect would just make it great for viewers. I think he’d find true love out there.”

Just as Alpine villagers awake to the sound of morning yodelers, Harvard students awake to the sound of Top 40 songs as they groggily shovel hash browns onto their plates at hot breakfast in Annenberg.The infectious tunes haven't gone unnoticed by students, with Kyle Whelihan '17 remarking in a recent Facebook post: “Petition to hold an impromptu rave in the kitchens of Annenberg since the music they play in there is already better than any real dorm party.” Kyle, we couldn't agree more. But even among the stellar line-up, some songs stand out from the rest. Here's a breakdown:
Most Educational: “Roar” by Katy PerryNot only does this song have a great message of self-empowerment, it also warms up English concentrators for their lit seminars with a plethora of literary devices: “Now I’m floating like a butterfly / Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes / I went from zero, to my own hero.” Quick, is that a simile or a metaphor? In a similar vein, “Dark Horse” by Katy Perry features Juicy J’s inventive food imagery, perfect for the dhall: “She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart / She'll turn cold as a freezer.”Most Uncomfortable When Standing in Line Next to an Attractive Person: “BedRock” by Young MoneyAlthough this song was released in 2009, it has made a recent comeback on the HUDS airwaves. Lyrics don’t often get more incongruous than hearing “my room is the g-spot / call me Mr. Flintstone / I can make your bedrock” as you fill your plate with scrambled eggs. With a plethora of explicit verses featuring the likes of Nicki Minaj and Tyga, this is the song you hope will not be playing when you reach for the ladle from the tomato basil ravioli soup pot and accidentally touch the hand of the hot guy in your Ec section. A close second goes to “Talk Dirty” by Jason DeRulo featuring 2Chainz, whose main hook features the statement “been around the world, don't speak the language / but your booty don't need explaining,” though this song’s international theme might have been appropriate at the World Street Foods brunch last week.Most Validating of Harvard's Complaining Culture: “Complicated” by Avril LavigneThis song has been channeling the inner turmoil of angsty teens for over a decade, and it’s still as relevant as ever. The first chorus lyric perfectly channels the beginning of a classic Harvard dining hall conversation: “Why do you have to go and make things so complicated, [insert professor name here]? Ugh, I have no time to do my p-set and write my five papers because I have to go to meetings for my 134838 extracurriculars and write applications for a few super-exclusive international non-profit internships this summer. I am like, so busy!” Alternatively, Daniel Powter’s “Bad Day” functions to validate the stress while moving in a more positive direction, making it the perfect song for a post-LS1b midterm Brain Break.

Even though Flyby has already given the freshmen a list of ideal blockmates, Yard-dwellers (and those foreigners in the Union Dorms) are still pulling their hair out trying to perfect blocking plans. To alleviate the stress, here’s a step-by-step guide on perfecting your blocking group.
1. Get your core group.
As long as you hit your core (abs joke), you’re all set. We’ll cover a few FAQs about this:
“Hey, Flyby, should I block with my freshman roommates?”
Dumb question. Block with people you don’t hate. If you liked your freshman roommate and don’t hate living with him/her, go for it. If not, then don’t.
“Oh. That’s interesting. What about my boyfriend/girlfriend/FWB?”
No.
“Well that was curt.”
It’s a bad idea. Do you not see all the ways that could go wrong? That’s what linking is for.
“I guess you’re right. Well I haven’t even started thinking about it yet…”
Oh, right. Because every member of the Class of 2017 didn’t know this was coming months ago. You’ve got some catching up to do.
“But how?!?”
It’s really weird, we know, but you’ve met people at Harvard. Hopefully some of those people are your friends. Worst case scenario, you have a roommate who probably has an open spot in his/her blocking group. Just have a conversation about it...like, really soon.
“Thanks, Flyby, you’re the best and we really love reading you while we bored in lecture.”
No problem, sport. And remember, one can be a blocking group. If you have no other option, you can run as a lone wolf.
2. Establish yourself as the alpha (fe)male of your core blocking group
This is very important. How do you expect the blocking group to end up the way you want it if your close friends think that they get a say in things? That would be ridiculous. Start by getting meals with your blocking group and casually demanding that they get you things from the servery. Then start making unilateral decisions about weekend plans, where to study, etc. It can’t go wrong and everyone will respect you for it.
3. Once your core group fears...um respects... you, put up flyers to attract a few “floaters”
You only have five blockmates? That won’t do. All the cool kids have eight. Lie on the flyers if you have to. Do you have a medical condition that you are sure will keep your blocking group out of the Quad? No? Say it anyway.
4. Bribery
Do you want to get Quadded or put in Mather? Start a blocking group fund, hustle over to the Office of Student Life, and start slipping some people a few Hamiltons.
So that’s that. Obviously don’t actually bribe people. And don’t actually assert your dominance in your blocking group. But definitely do make sure that you’re in a group with people that you don’t hate or think you would hate living with. One last piece of advice: don’t block with people who hate you. They may be your ideal friends, but you don’t want to be the odd Crimson out.
