After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts Congressional candidate Sean Bielat raised roughly $175,000 in the first quarter of 2012, according to a campaign spokesperson. The numbers, while still an estimate, push the Fourth District Republican contender over the $200,000 mark with the election still seven months away.
"We're really thrilled with that number," the campaign's communication director Sarah Rumpf said.
Bielat, a former marine turned consultant and technology executive, is considered the frontrunner for his party's nomination in the race for the seat left vacant by retiring Congressman Barney Frank '61-'62. He will likely face off against Democrat Joseph P. Kennedy in the general election this fall.
The 2012 race is not Bielat's first bid for the Fourth District Congressional seat. He ran against Frank in 2010, losing by 11 points—the closest margin the district had seen in years.
Though the 2010 race drew a great deal of national attention and brought Bielat's campaign widespread party support, polls have shown Kennedy with an early two-to-one lead.
Bielat's campaign raised almost $2.5 million during the last election, but the vast majority of those funds were raised after the party primary, according to Rumpf. The campaign's first quarter fundraising total is roughly equal to what the campaign earned through the summer of 2010 during the last race, Rumpf added.
Rumpf said the campaign has reason to be optimistic. They have already received donations from roughly 1900 individuals, matching the 2010 total, and have seen an early increase in volunteers, she said.
"We're obviously not going to be able to compete with the Kennedy fundraising machine," Rumpf said. "But we've got the foundation we need to get our message out to voters."
Kennedy has not yet released his first quarter fundraising totals. The campaign declined to offer a date when they might be released, but indications are that the numbers could be considerably large. Drawing on the support of his family name and connections, Kennedy has already held major fundraisers in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, in addition to numerous events around the Fourth District.
Both Bielat and Kennedy hold Harvard degrees. Bielat earned a master's degree form the Harvard Kennedy School while Kennedy graduated from Harvard Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alex Killorn has already begun his professional career, but the collegiate awards for him and junior teammate Danny Biega continue to roll in.
On Friday, the duo received their biggest honor of all when they were chosen as first-team All-Americans by the American Hockey Coaches Association.
Killorn, a forward, and Biega, a defenseman, were selected for the first team along with 10 other skaters at the NCAA Men’s Frozen Four in Tampa, Fla.,—the same city in which Killorn hopes one day to skate as a professional after signing a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 19.
The two Montreal natives are Harvard’s first All-Americans since Noah Welch ’05 was named to the first team and Dov Grumet-Morris ’05 was chosen for the second team in 2004-2005. The last pair of Crimson teammates to earn first team All-American honors in the same season was Steve Martins ’95 and Sean McCann ’94 in the 1994 season.
The Crimson, whose season ended with a loss in the ECAC Championship on March 17, is the only team in the country to land two players on the All-American first team—which was split into east and west squads—this season.
The east team, in addition to Biega and Killorn, also consists of Union goalie Troy Grosenick, Boston College defenseman Brian Dumoulin, Maine forward Spencer Abbott, and Colgate forward Austin Smith. The ECAC led all conferences with four first-team selections.
Being named All-Americans merely added to a slew of awards that Killorn and Biega have received this postseason. Both were also chosen for the New England Division I All-Star team, the ECAC Hockey All-League team, the All-Ivy first team, and the ECAC Hockey All-Tournament squad.
Killorn, who ranked third in the country with 0.68 goals per game (23 total), was twice named ECAC Player of the Week.
Biega, who ranked second in the country among defensemen with 1.03 points per game (35 total), was also the runner-up for ECAC Player of the Year and was named the league’s Best Defensive Defenseman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Books have already been written about the phenomenon of Jeremy Lin ’10, and movies are certainly just around the corner. But a Harvard man like Lin also deserves representation in the highest form of entertainment: theater. Therefore, we at The Back Page have put together a quick synopsis of what Lin’s season would look like in the form of a five-part play, with just enough bad puns based off the protagonist’s name to make you sick.
Part 1: StruggLin to find a team
 
It’s hard to believe now, but six months ago Lin was an unknown benchwarmer who didn’t have a team to call his own. After being cut by the Warriors and Rockets in quick succession, the Harvard grad was jobless. But just because Lin was unemployed doesn’t mean he was Linactive. Despite the hard times, Lin continued to work hard day Lin and day out, hoping for an opportunity to prove himself. Eventually, the phone rang.
Part 2: The New York Knicks, Lincorporated
Two days after Christmas, Lin got his wish. He finally got a call. The Knicks were Linterested in his talents. But things didn’t start out swimmingly—Lin joined the squad as one of the lowest members on the depth chart and played like it early on. Three weeks later, Lin was sent to the Development League due to his Linadequacy in New York. Lin popped right back to New York six days later though, thanks in large point to a triple-double performance in the D-League. When Baron Davis suffered a setback as he attempted to recover from injury, Lin moved up in the pecking order and eventually got his shot.
Part 3: The Linderella Ball
On what would have been just another Saturday night, Lin got significant playing time against the Nets and made the best of it. Playing against All-Star Deron Williams, the N.Y. guard posted 25 points, five rebounds, and seven assists, earning a spot in the starting lineup in the process. He only turned his game up from there. After netting 28 points in his following game and then tallying his first career double-double, Lin took on the vaunted Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night’s national TV. He proved he was for real by leading the Knicks to a 92-85 victory, scoring 38 points in the process, four more than Kobe Bryant, one of the NBA’s top scorers. Linsanity reached its peak on none other than ValeLINtine’s day, when he hit a game-winning shot to top the Toronto Raptors. Lin was officially a superstar, making appearances on back-to-back Sports Illustrated covers and garnering attention around the world. It wouldn’t last though, as he would soon find out.
Part 4: Linsolvency
Lin captured one more win to push his winning streak as a starter to six, only to fall shortly after to the lowly New Orleans Hornets. In that game, Lin committed a Linadmissable nine turnovers, pushing his total in just over a week to 45, more than any other player had ever committed in their first seven starts. The next week was up and down as Lin and the Knicks defeated the reigning champion Mavericks, but also lost to the New Jersey Nets and Miami Heat. During the stretch, Lin had to deal with adversity he could never have prepared for as a benchwarmer. He became the most talked about athlete in the world and the center of a constant drama. When Carmelo Anthony came back from injury on Feb 20, pundits pitted the All-Star against the new star, saying they couldn’t coexist. The duo proved the doubters right as the Knicks sputtered, going 2-8 and eventually costing the job of head coach Mike D’Antoni—the man who gave Lin a shot and who had created a system that helped Lin thrive.
Part 5: The Linjury
After the remarkable rise and rapid fall, the story of Linsanity came to a screeching halt at the end of March as the protagonist of the mythic tale tore his knee’s miniscus. The injury required surgery and will necessitate a minimum of six-weeks of rehabilitation. But this isn’t the end of the story. Far from it. Lin should make a full recovery and make a powerful impact next year, but maybe not for the Knicks. Lin will become a free agent at the end of this season though most experts expect him to resign with the Knicks.  Even if Lin doesn’t come back and perform at the level he did in February, his rise will still represent one of the most remarkable stories in sports history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding momentum from Wednesday’s 5-3 win over crosstown rival BC—a victory that broke a 15-game losing streak against the Eagles—the Harvard baseball team came out similarly strong in its second game of the year at O’Donnell Field.
The Crimson (5-22, 2-6 Ivy) picked up two runs in the first inning of its first of two contests against Columbia (12-16, 5-3) on Saturday on the way to a 6-2 victory—Harvard’s first over the Lions since April 1, 2007, when the Crimson split a doubleheader at Columbia’s Robertson Field.
But unfortunately for Harvard, its first winning streak of 2012 proved to be a short one, as the Lions charged back to a 10-1 win in Saturday’s nightcap, handing the Crimson its second split in three Ivy League series.
“We came out pretty strong,” said freshman right-handed pitcher Tanner Anderson. “It was good getting the win against Columbia in the first game. The second game didn’t go as planned, but we definitely learned a few things. We haven’t beaten [the Lions] in a few years, so it was definitely nice to come away with a win.”
COLUMBIA 10, HARVARD 1
In the second matchup between the two teams, Columbia’s offense stole the show, scoring five unanswered runs in the first inning followed by two in the second, putting Harvard in a deep hole from the start of the second game of the doubleheader.
“We were a bit complacent at the start of the second game,” Anderson said. “In the first game, our offense was doing really well, same with our defense. In the second game, that fell a little bit, but sometimes that happens.”
Harvard managed seven hits over the course of the game—just three fewer than Columbia’s total—but the Crimson failed to capitalize on its scoring opportunities, stranding 10 runners on base, including three in the seventh inning.
Down 8-0 in the bottom of the sixth, Harvard tallied its lone run of the game. With the bases loaded, sophomore catcher Steven Dill grounded into a 4-6-3 double play, scoring freshman center fielder Mike Martin from third. Sophomore left fielder Jack Colton flied out to left to end the inning, stranding a runner on third.
“We didn’t hit the ball terribly, it was just right to [Columbia] players,” Martin said. “They had a lot of double plays, but give credit to their pitcher for keeping us off base.”
Columbia closed out scoring for the two teams with two ninth-inning tallies. Two walks and a wild pitch from Harvard’s third reliever of the day, sophomore Peter Kaplan, set the stage for an RBI single and run-scoring groundout. The bottom of the final inning of the day proved to be a quick one, and the Crimson went 1-2-3 in the ninth.
“It was a pretty terrible game,” Martin said. “They got some key hits with the bases loaded…and we went down early. It’s pretty hard to come back from 5-0 down, but we had a chance.”
HARVARD 6, COLUMBIA 2
Harvard led the way for the duration of game one, maintaining at least a one-run advantage throughout the contest after going up, 2-0, in the first inning.
“Our offense was really kicking in,” Anderson said. “We jumped ahead really quick. We got two on the board in the first inning and kept going at it. On defense, we were just making plays.”
Senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds started off a productive first inning for the Crimson, driving in Martin with a double down the right-field line. In Harvard’s next at bat designated hitter Marcus Way grounded out, and Reynolds scored on the play.
“We got ahead early,” Martin said. “We got a pretty good lead with runs in the first inning, and after that it was a pretty fast game.”
Columbia struck back in the top of the third, as third baseman Jon Elsen scored from third on right fielder Nick Ferraresi’s RBI double.
But that was as close as the Lions got. The Crimson tacked on runs in both the third and fourth innings, as senior right fielder J.T. Tomes and Dill scored for Harvard in consecutive innings.
Anderson earned the win for the Crimson and struck out seven batters in 5.2 innings pitched. Junior Zach Olson, who came on in relief, induced an inning-ending double play to escape a bases-loaded jam in the top of the seventh. In the process, Olson earned his second save of the year.
After Columbia scored in the fifth to cut the deficit to 4-2, Harvard closed the door in the sixth frame, notching two runs on RBIs from junior first baseman Rob Wineski and freshman catcher Ethan Ferreira.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a historic day for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team, but that wasn’t enough to earn the win. Looking to exact revenge against league rival No. 5 Cornell, which dropped the Crimson in last year’s Ivy League championship game, Harvard fell behind early.
Senior attackman Jeff Cohen scored three times to become Harvard’s all-time leader in career goals, but the scores were not enough to bring the Crimson back, as it fell, 14-10, in Ithaca on Saturday afternoon.
Harvard (5-5, 2-1 Ivy) managed just one goal in the first half, a score from junior midfielder Ryan Stevens midway through the first quarter.
Besides that, the half belonged to the Big Red (8-1, 4-0). After Stevens’ goal tied the game at one, Cornell reeled off five unanswered goals, including a dominant second quarter in which it outscored the Crimson 4-0.
Harvard, which trailed 6-1 at the half, improved its play in the third quarter as it tried to chip away at the deficit.
Two goals apiece from Cohen and Stevens in the third quarter pulled the Crimson within four goals, 9-5, as it entered the final frame.
Harvard cut Cornell’s lead to three on three occasions throughout the quarter, the penultimate time coming with under six minutes to play when co-captain Kevin Vaughan found the back of the net.
But Harvard was unable to get any closer than that. Big Red freshman attackman Matt Donovan scored to make it 12-8 before Crimson rookie attackman Keegan Michel answered to again pull the visitors within three goals, this time with just under three minutes to play.
Cornell senior midfielder Scott Austin scored seconds later to all but seal the game, and each team added another goal in the waning seconds as the Big Red walked off with the win.
“They simply outplayed us in the first half,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We played much better in the second, but it wasn’t enough.”
The second quarter proved disastrous for the Crimson, which trailed only 2-1 after the first frame. Donovan put the Big Red up two goals on a score three-and-a-half minutes into the quarter and earned the assist on a man-up goal from senior midfielder Mitch McMichael a minute later.
Senior midfielder Roy Lang scored his second goal of the game to stretch the Cornell lead to four with just over six minutes to play in the half, and JJ Gilbane made it 6-1 less than a minute later.
“I was definitely disappointed with how we played in the second quarter,” Cohen said.
And things could have been worse for Harvard, Wojcik said, had it not been for the performance of freshman goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky. The rookie keeper made ten saves in the opening frame while the Big Red outshot the Crimson 11-6 in the first quarter and 14-2 in the second.
Although Harvard’s play improved dramatically in the third quarter, it was unable to string together the necessary goals for a second-half run. Cohen scored just over a minute into the third frame, but the Big Red responded with a goal two minutes later. Stevens scored his second goal on a man-up attack soon after, but the Crimson couldn’t keep the momentum.
Cornell answered with a goal from Max Van Bourgondien with four minutes to play in the quarter, and Lang pushed the deficit to five with a goal less than a minute later. Stevens completed his hat trick with just over a minute remaining in the frame, and Harvard went into the fourth quarter down four goals.
Cohen struck first for the Crimson less than a minute into the final frame to pull Harvard within three, but that deficit proved to be an unbreakable barrier.
Two straight goals from Mike O’Neil and Chris Langton put Cornell up 11-6 with slightly under nine minutes to play. Sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp responded with a goal of his own before Vaughan scored to again cut the Big Red lead to three. But Cornell outscored the Crimson in the final minutes to deny the comeback attempt.
According to Wojcik, The Crimson can take some consolation in its second-half performance, in which it outscored Cornell, 9-8, and outshot the Big Red, 24-17.
“It is encouraging to have played them close in the second half,” said Cohen, whose 39 goals through 10 games this season vault him ahead of Dave Bohn ’61, who held the Harvard record for career goals for over 50 years.
The loss is the first in the league for the Crimson, which falls to third place behind undefeated Princeton and Cornell. A potential rematch with the Big Red will have to wait until the Ivy League Tournament in May.
“We know we can play with those guys,” Cohen said. “We hope we get a chance to see them again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, besting Brown, 16-8, Saturday afternoon at Harvard Stadium.
The final score does not tell the full story of the Crimson’s dominance. Led by six goals from junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen, Harvard (5-6, 2-2 Ivy) took an early four-goal advantage and never trailed in the contest. The Bears (5-5, 1-3) showed signs of life with a pair of goals from sophomore Bre Hudgins midway through the first half, but the Crimson was able to score four more consecutive tallies to give Harvard what proved to be an insurmountable 8-2 lead.
“This game we were ready to come out hard and come out fast, and that’s what we did,” said VanderMeulen, whose six goals matched a career high.
Harvard was able to control the ball for much of the game and dominated the draw controls, 17-9. Sophomore Kyleigh Keating lost only one draw in the first half, which put the Crimson in control of the game.
“Kyleigh just did amazing,” said VanderMeulen of the sophomore, who finished with a career-high six draw controls. “We’ve been working on different people in the draw circle, and she just stepped up today and did an amazing job.”
The Crimson spread the ball around on offense and managed to find a number of open looks, converting 16 of 25 shot attempts. Juniors Micaela Cyr and Danielle Tetreault added three goals apiece, and Keating chipped in with two goals of her own.
“The offense is finally producing,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “We’re not just taking shots, we’re taking good shots.”
Harvard’s patience on offense played an important role in the Crimson’s ability to find open looks. After winning the game’s opening draw, Harvard held possession for nearly five minutes. While the Crimson was unable to convert on its first possession, the strategy eventually paid off.
“We wanted to be sure we weren’t going to take a shot that we didn’t think had a very good chance of going in,” said Baskind, who finished with a goal and a game-high five ground balls. “I’m proud of us for waiting for a good opportunity.”
While Harvard was frustrated on its first possession, it did not take long for VanderMeulen to add her first tally of the game, an unassisted goal at 21:51. Within 74 seconds, she added two more goals to complete the hat trick.
“We moved off ball really well, which can confuse defenses,” VanderMeulen said. “I thought we did a really good job creating space for each other.”
Baskind and VanderMeulen both pointed to a particularly successful week of practice as a catalyst for Harvard’s most lopsided win of the season.
“I thought we had a really good week of practice and worked really hard,” Baskind said. “We’re not just going through drills anymore; we’re being productive in them, and I think that really carried over to the game today.”
After Hudgins’ two scores made it 4-2 with 12:17 to go, the Crimson got back on track with a goal from Baskind, who beat her defender one-on-one and was able to sneak a shot by Brown goalie Isabel Harvey.
Harvard tacked on three more in the first half and went into the break up, 8-3, after Brown freshman Alexandra Crerend finished a pass from senior Julia Keller for an open-net goal.
The Bears scored first in the second half, as Abby Bunting beat freshman goalkeeper Kelly Weiss (three saves, eight goals allowed) to bring the Bears to within four.
But the contest was never closer than that again. Harvard responded with an 8-1 run fueled by scores from five different players to take a 13-5 lead. With the game out of reach, the Bears found the net three times in the final four minutes.
“This is a great Ivy win, and I think it builds confidence for us,” VanderMeulen said. “We have Holy Cross on Wednesday, but then we have Princeton next Saturday, so this is a great platform to build off of for the rest of our Ivy games.”
Baskind also noted the significance of the win going forward in Ivy League play.
“We’re building expectations for ourselves,” Baskind said. “We play a hard schedule for a reason, and we are looking forward from here on out.”
With the win, Harvard took sole possession of fifth place in the Ancient Eight standings. The Crimson will need a top-four finish to earn a berth in the postseason Ivy League tournament.

Chelsea S. Link '12, a self-described atheist, has never been afraid to challenge mainstream religious beliefs or the views of her own family members.
"My grandmother almost had a heart attack when she found out," she said.
Link is refering to her New Year's resolution to read the Bible from cover to cover by the end of 2012 and blog about her reactions to the Old and New Testaments on her website "Blogging Biblically".
"It's the kind of thing everyone should read because it's so culturally significant," Link said about the Bible. "If you're into Western literature at all, you should read it all the way through."
Her resolution inspired her to create her blog, in which she documents her responses to the best-selling book of all time. Her posts highlight specific verses and include her interpretations of them.
On Jan. 9, Link wrote a post she entitled "Santorum's Gay Sex Riot Nightmare." The article got over 400 hits and since then her blog has gathered a following.
"A lot of people think that reading the Bible will make me want to convert, but one of the reasons I'm reading it is to become as conscientious an atheist as possible," Link said.
Link said that she sometimes gets comments from complete strangers about her blog. "When I donated blood a couple of weeks ago, one of the girls who was a volunteer there saw my name tag and asked, 'Are you Chelsea Link? I love your blog!'" Link said.
Lately, however, Link has also been receiving negative messages and scathing remarks about what she has written. Though she said that she has not gotten the kind of hate mail that the famous scholar and atheist Richard Dawkins gets, people have expressed that they find her blog to be disrespectful.
"My approach is to be totally honest about my feelings and people's beliefs," Link said. "I may think the Old Testament is absurd, but I'm also not afraid to admit when something is really beautiful. I try to point that out so people see that I'm being even-handed."
"God's rules are whack," she continued. "In the Ten Commandments, 'thou shalt not kill' is sixth. There's so much other stuff before there's any mention of human relationships and behavior."
If you'd like to hear Link speak about her views, come listen to her on Monday during morning prayers at Memorial Church where she will discuss agape and Humanism. That, or just spend some time reading her blog.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: April 8, 2011
The April 7 post "Harvard Atheist Bible Blogger" incorrectly identified Link's topic of discussion at Memorial Church. In fact, Link will be talking about agape and Humanism.

Will it be a battle between a dragon and a phoenix? Or will it come down to a unicorn or an acorn?
Adams House has decided to get a mascot after an initial poll indicated that about 80 percent of Adams residents are in favor of having one, according to Adams HoCo Co-Chair Jackson F. Cashion '13.
"I think having a mascot would be really fun," Cashion said. "It would enhance House life and help us to be more creative in terms of how we present ourselves.".
The five contenders in this battle for House immortality are the acorn, bear, dragon, phoenix, and unicorn. These were the five most suggested options based on the poll that was sent out to the House email listserv a couple of weeks ago.
In another email sent out to Adams residents, HoCo Co-Chairs Joseph Brancale '13 and Cashion urged students to cast their ballot for a choice "that will impact Adams House forever."
"Please think about what kind of legacy we want to leave Adams House when voting for this mascot," the email read.
Students have indeed taken the poll seriously, with a huge debate erupting over the House listserve concerning the mascot choice. Adams student will have to wait until Sunday at midnight when the poll closes to find out who their new mascot will be.
