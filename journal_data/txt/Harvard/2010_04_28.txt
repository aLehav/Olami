After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday, Congress’s best chance to enact considerable climate legislation anytime soon received a devastating blow. Citing his concern over Democrats’ focus on immigration reform, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham withdrew his support for a climate-change bill that was supposed to be announced on Monday. Although it is certainly Sen. Graham’s right to be upset over the Democrats' decision to also begin discussions on a new immigration bill, choosing to pull support, especially when the bill was so close to being formally introduced and stood a good chance of passing, was a terrible decision on many fronts. A member of Congress should never withdraw support for a bill for any reason besides issues with its content; Sen. Graham’s dishonesty is a perversion of the legislative process. In addition, by withdrawing his support, Sen. Graham likely sacrificed the opportunity to make tangible progress in the fight against climate change.
Following co-author Sen. Graham’s decision, the bill likely faces stiff competition. The bill supposedly was to include many important goals such as reducing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 17 percent over the next 10 years, employing an emissions cap on several economic sectors, creating a $10-billion fund for clean-coal power plants and 12 new nuclear power plants, and providing incentives for building nuclear power plants. Although we can only speculate as to its full impact, the proposed bill with the aforementioned specifics is a step in the right direction—even if the measures inside of it may not go as far as all environmentalists would like. Although some environmentalists believe that the current bill is not strict enough, especially since it strips the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate carbon pollution, this opportunity for reform, albeit stunted, cannot be missed.
While this bill is certainly progressive, it does not—as far as the public knows—contain provisions to fully curb emissions, in addition to other measures that would slow the rate of climate change. Even if the current bill passes, Congress should focus on crafting and passing an even stronger bill to protect our environment. Following the global response to climate change in Copenhagen, the U.S. still lags behind its European counterparts in reducing carbon-dioxide emissions; while European countries are offering to cut pollution by 30 percent below 1990 levels, the U.S. commitment totals only four percent from 1990 levels. In particular, although clean-coal technologies sound environmentally friendly, in reality, the transportation and manufacturing of these technologies arguably result in greater carbon-dioxide emissions than merely burning the coal.
As a leader among developed countries, the U.S. must take a more proactive leadership position in the debate over climate change. We are glad that the U.S. has started to take this obligation seriously but ask that a climate change bill not fall by the wayside. The oil crisis of the 1970s highlighted the dangers of relying on a single energy currency, and we have known for decades that diversification is the key to energy independence. A stronger climate change bill could encourage the development of alternative energy sources and help free the U.S. from dependence on foreign fossil fuels.
In addition, we encourage Americans to motivate Congress to pass both this bill and a later, stronger one. Environmental organizations should rally and encourage voters to urge their representatives to bring climate change to the congressional table. With new social tools at their disposal, students and other activists should utilize the numerous and different types of communication to make climate change a priority. Regardless of one’s political beliefs, climate change merits congressional debate, and social activism is a perfect catalyst for such discussion.

The World Expo, which is being held from May 1 to Oct. 30 in Shanghai this year, is yet another majestic display of China’s fast-paced development in the last 20 years. The pomp and wealth of this international gathering is likely to surpass the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics in splendor, as well as in controversy and politicization. While I am excited about the Expo because it will bring foreigners to China and expose them to  its political development better than any newspaper coverage could, I am more excited about the benefits that this could bring to the Chinese people. The World Expo will “open” China and allow its citizens to participate in a larger discussion about globalization and development that is missing in the current, politically complacent society.
Numerous studies show that Asians and Asian Americans are comparatively politically inactive, even when they are given the opportunity to participate in government. Here in the United States, there are 15.5 million Asian Americans, but you rarely hear about advocacy groups that target Asian-American issues or the influence of the Asian Pacific American Caucus. In fact, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up almost five percent of the U.S. population, but there are only eight members in the House of Representatives and the Senate of that ethnic group. Eight out of 535 is just 1.5 percent.
There are many reasons for this disparity in participation. Some say it is due to the lack of a unifying cause. Asians are largely a hardworking group of people, stereotypically focused on economic gain and stability, and are unlikely to stir trouble even when discrimination is taking place. There is no identifiably “Asian” issue to advocate, and even if there were, Asians are unlikely to think it important enough to leverage resources on it. This political complacency could also be explained by the fact that Asians have been traditionally denied the right to participate rigorously in their government as a result of a caste-centered history, and this culture persists today. Eastern philosophy, which stresses obedience to authority and family ties over individuality, is yet another explanation for Asians’ political timidity.
Why is the World Expo going to change all of that?
The Beijing Olympics already awakened a consciousness in the minds of the Chinese people and government of the fact that development in isolation is no longer a viable option. The Olympics was a source of national pride, but it was also a dress rehearsal for the larger role that China will play on the global stage on issues like trade, the environment, and international security. Because the Olympics was a sporting event, discussion of other topics was limited for the sake of the spirit of the games. At the World Expo, however, all bets are off. Almost every day of the Expo will feature forums conducted about the prevailing issues of development, urbanization, and globalization; most will be open to the public and invite a variety of participants.
The theme of the World Expo is “better city, better life.” I admit that this does not lend itself to the kinds of controversial discussions that newspapers would fawn over, but the purpose of these discussion forums is not to make headlines but to increase participation. Sustainable growth and development touch the Chinese people more directly than the U.S. selling arms to Taiwan. For example, Shanghai is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with over 13,000 people per square kilometer, and affordable living is getting harder and harder. Because of the World Expo, there already have been efforts made by the Shanghai municipal government to incorporate citizen participation in the course of designing a “better city.” The mayor of Shanghai pledges to seek public opinion on the city’s scheme to make housing and renting more affordable.
Political efficacy is not built overnight. It requires a participatory citizenry. The Chinese people are unlikely to become politically active just because China has liberalized and become a democracy. The path to increased political participation is paved with neutral, apolitical discussions that Chinese people are comfortable having but at the same time carry significant consequences in their daily lives.

The poster for “With God on Our Side,” a documentary about Christian Zionism screened at the Divinity School last week, depicts the barrier separating Israel from most of the West Bank towering over two women, one of whom wears a hijab. “I grew up in a house that had very specific [religious and political] views toward Israel,” the film’s producer/director Porter Speakman, Jr. told the audience, referring to his upbringing as an Evangelical Christian Zionist. After spending five years living beyond that West Bank barrier, however, Speakman realized that there was a side of the story that he wasn’t being told in church.
The film, he explained, is not meant to be a “historical film,” nor a film that aims to depict “the whole story” of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It aims instead to weave the history into a critique of modern-day Evangelical Christian Zionist politics and theology. The film argues quite convincingly that this denomination’s religious belief should not necessitate the support of every single Israeli policy, especially if doing so would override Christian values like justice and compassion. However, while the film successfully makes space for religious criticism of Israel, its rhetorical slant undermines its own call for an honest assessment of religious support for the Jewish state.
Theologically, the film’s argument is quite compelling. The forms of Christian Zionism it discusses—the kind espoused by televangelists like Pat Robertson and John Hagee—interpret the founding of the state of Israel as a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies that an ingathering of the exiles will precede the coming of the Messiah. In addition, Christian Zionists like Hagee read God’s promise in Genesis 12:3—that God will curse any nation that curses Israel—quite literally, and they therefore proclaim that America must unconditionally back Israel regardless of its policies. 
The film effectively deconstructs this theology by noting that it conflates the modern state of Israel with the Jewish people as a whole. Anti-Semites may be divinely damned according to Genesis 12, but protesting the decisions of a particular Israeli Prime Minister is far from anti-Semitic. Indeed, if a person believes that the Israeli government is violating his own moral principles, either religious or secular, it is his duty to stand up and make his grievances known.
As long, of course, as his criticism is constructive, thoughtful, and holds to those same moral principles. But this is where Speakman’s film fails miserably.
Consistently, the film either dismisses Israel’s position outright or neglects it entirely, thereby committing the same offense as the evangelical community it decries, except in reverse. The film implies that Israel could end the entire conflict solely by returning the land it occupied in 1967 and blames Israel for the continuing state of hostilities. So what about the peace plans proposed by Israeli and American leaders as recently as 2007 that would have had Israel give up 94 percent of the West Bank, and trade six percent of Israel proper for the population centers that the country would keep? One of the film’s talking heads asserts that the Palestinians were completely justified in refusing these offers because Israel does not “have a right to one percent of the West Bank.” However, had Abu Mazen decided to even discuss Ehud Olmert’s 2007 outline for peace rather than ignoring it, the Israeli public might have felt less compelled to elect the hard-line rightist government that is currently frustrating both the Palestinian Authority and the Obama administration.
Simply put, rather than aiming to understand the rationale for Israel’s decisions as it does for those of the Palestinians, the film accepts a narrative as rigid and inflexible as that of the Christian Zionists it derides. Speakman has simply switched sides, trading one fundamentalism for another.
Consider the example of the Israeli separation barrier, which even the film admits has drastically decreased terrorist attacks within Israel. Because the wall juts out over the internationally recognized 1949 Armistice Line and snakes through the West Bank, the film considers it a “land-grab,” an attempt by the Israeli government to widen Israel’s borders and dehumanize the Palestinians. It utterly fails to mention that the barrier only moves beyond the Armistice Line to protect Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that a recent removal of a roadblock near Nablus, for example, led to a drive-by shooting only days later.
Like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a whole, the wall surely carries deep moral quandaries, such as, for example, the issue of whether a country can expropriate foreign land and hinder access to health care for another people in order to protect itself. A Christian (or Jew) should not be so dogmatic in his eschatology that he refrains from criticizing Israel if its policies violate his moral conscience. True support of Israel absolutely necessitates such criticism. But by neglecting nuance and context, the film erects even more barriers between Israelis, Palestinians, and their supporters. Unfortunately, when one sidesteps vital ethical questions and constructive discussion for simplistic excoriation of one side, one merely poisons the discourse further, becoming nothing more than just another brick in the wall.

Tuberculosis: The very name of the disease evokes images of antiquity, a footnote in dusty encyclopedias of human sickness overshadowed by the abbreviated diseases of the present—SARS, HIV/AIDS, H1N1. Few students would be able to guess that one third of the world’s population is infected with TB or that more than 12,000 cases were reported in the U.S. in 2008. Transmitted by coughing, sneezing, or spitting, TB thrives in the humid and closely-packed quarters of slums and urban outskirts.
However, just last week, a Harvard student was diagnosed with TB, with roughly 40 identified as at risk for exposure as a result of this case, reminding us of its startling proximity to our privileged community. Instead of dismissing it as a disease of the developing world, we should take this opportunity to recognize TB’s continued relevance on the public health advocacy agenda and engage with the actors that have long stalled progress.
After a long period of decline, TB incidence has risen dramatically since the 1980s, despite the improvement of sanitary conditions, the development of anti-TB drugs in the 1950s, and the introduction of the World Health Organization’s directly-observed treatment short-course program for more effective treatment. In 1993, the WHO declared TB a global-health emergency, setting ambitious goals which it later conceded could not be met by 2003 or possibly even 2015. That is to say, the consequences from the years of inadequate treatment and low attention to disease control in resource-poor regions have become increasingly clear.
First, the current treatment regimen requires patients take a cocktail of four drugs, all nearly half a century old, for at least six months. The logistical and financial hurdles associated with paying for and completing treatment, however, virtually guarantee noncompliance and relapse. Second, in a cascade effect, noncompliance selects for drug-resistant strains of the mutated pathogen, precipitating the rise of multi-drug resistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis. Treatment for drug-resistant TB with second-line drugs is astronomically more expensive, more time-intensive, and associated with more toxic side effects. Third, the rise of TB and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection means TB is leading cause of death among HIV-positive patients: In Africa, HIV is the single most important factor contributing to the increasing incidence of TB over the last 10 years.
Moving forward, progress in developing new drugs has long been stalled by a combination of inadequate funding, regulatory bottlenecks, and tepid support from the pharmaceutical industry. Thanks largely to years of advocacy and the establishment of innovative public-private partnerships spanning the two sectors, new drugs and new models of clinical development are finally in the pipeline. Instead of developing new drugs one-by-one, the Critical Path to TB Regimens Initiative would bring together drug developers, under a “patients-first” commitment, to test their compounds together as an entirely new four-drug combination—a process that would take six, rather than 24, years.
New therapeutic regimens represent, however, only half the solution. Without commensurate scale-up of community-based treatment programs—the “social” dimension of treatment—or reform of inefficient drug delivery mechanisms in developing countries, TB treatment will remain inaccessible, ineffective, and ultimately futile. To finally turn the clock back on the spread of TB and its even more dangerous resistant strains, we need a concerted effort spanning industry, state, the public sector, and citizenry.
All stakeholders, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, multilateral organizations, and national governments shoulder part of the blame and bear hope for progress. As students, we must stand up to ensure that drugs and essential technologies created and licensed at Harvard are made openly available. As citizens, we have a right to demand that our government understands that the eradication of TB is more than a charitable cause: It is a national-security, economic-policy, public-health, and moral issue. Finally, as human beings, we have an obligation to open our eyes to the many forgotten faces of suffering and poverty, some of whom are among us today, ravaged by the continued and lingering specter of tuberculosis.

Harvard will soon name a new administrator to oversee campus operations, a top position that will be restructured to eliminate administrative inefficiencies before the next academic year, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp said Monday.
The new leader will hold the refashioned title of Vice President for Campus Services—formerly Vice President for Administration—and will oversee the University’s central operations functions and dining facilities, in addition to the Harvard Faculty Club and Harvard Magazine.
“We’ve conducted a nationwide search,” Lapp said. “We’ve looked at a number of candidates. We’re close to a decision point.”
Lapp added that applicants for the job each proposed ideas for streamlining the organization of the office’s myriad functions in line with the central administration’s ongoing efforts to merge human resources functions and reduce costs.
“Right now they operate somewhat independently from each other, but I think there’s a lot they can do across their departments,” Lapp said.
The office—which manages the University’s behind-the-scenes services, ranging from real estate to transportation—has lacked a permanent head since July 2009, when Sally H. Zeckhauser stepped down after over two decades of service.
Finding a new vice president before interim head Thomas E. Vautin departs has been a “primary focus” since Lapp’s arrival at Harvard in Oct. 2009.
Lapp said she decided to rename the position to reflect the office’s responsibilities, which are not limited to administrative services.
The Arnold Arboretum and Harvard University Press, which formerly reported to the vice president for administration, have been moved to the Provost’s office, and the University Planning Office—which manages campus planning and has played a role in the University’s development in Allston—will move to a new department of planning and construction.
Lapp declined to comment further on the new department, stating that it would be premature to discuss the unit’s responsibilities.

Five representatives from religious and advocacy groups gathered to discuss the legal ramifications of same-sex marriage at an event held yesterday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The panel, which featured a diverse range of opinions, was sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School California Caucus, the Commonwealth Caucus, the Latter-day Saint Student Association, and the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Caucus.
The speakers—Arline Isaacson, Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, Kris Mineau, Morris Thurston, and Greg Sorensen—delivered brief opening statements before engaging in a discussion that was open to audience members.
Isaacson, McCarthy, and Thurston each spoke in favor of same-sex marriage. Isaacson, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, addressed the "terra firma" aspects of the issue.
"Civil marriage is a gateway to over 1,400 benefits, rights, and protections," Isaacson said. Most of those rights, she added, require a marriage license and cannot be "contracted or collectively bargained for."
McCarthy, director of the Carr Center’s Human Rights and Social Movements Program and a lecturer at HKS and the College, drew parallels between the movement to legalize same-sex marriage and the civil rights movement.
Thurston, the only lawyer at the panel and a member of the Mormon Church, said he predicts that California’s state constitution will change to allow same-sex marriage within a few years.
But Mineau, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, a conservative public policy organization, argued against the idea that gay marriage is a civil right. He said that civil rights must come from the democratic legislative process and not from court decisions. A civil right cannot be taken away if it did not exist in the first place, he added.
Sorensen, assistant director of public affairs at the LDS Multi-Stake Public Affairs Council, also expressed support for the separation between civil union and marriage, stating that his church defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
The event’s main organizer, Carrie E. Sheffield, a Mormon student at HKS, said that the panel aimed to encourage civil dialogue around the highly politicized issue.
"We were hoping to move beyond the gridlocks," Sheffield said.

Although its year-long moratorium on property purchases in Allston will expire in two weeks, Harvard does not intend to purchase more real estate in the neighborhood in the coming months, according to University Executive Vice President Katharine N. Lapp.
“We certainly don’t have any plans to purchase more property in Allston,” Lapp said. “We are focusing on the property that we do own.”
Last spring, the University placed a moratorium on its property purchases in Allston so it could “evaluate options of the construction phasing for the science complex site,” according to University spokeswoman Lauren Marshall.
One year later, Harvard still seems to be considering strategies for moving forward, garnering a mixed reception from the community.
Lapp, who oversees Harvard’s expansion into Allston, said that the University is focusing mainly on property stewardship and leasing its empty holdings.
“We’ve improved some of the properties to bring them up to a level where they are rentable, and we have looked at ways to bring life to some of our holdings,” Lapp said.
Lapp specifically pointed to the empty Citgo station site as evidence of Harvard’s efforts.
“We’ve cleaned up the Citgo station,” she said, noting that 13 brokers have been to see the property. “We’ve had a tremendous amount of foot traffic going through that site, trying to come up with ideas, trying to come up with ways to find the right kind of tenant.”
In the past month, the University has announced two new leases, one to the Earthwatch Institute, a citizen science organization, and one to the Silk Road Project, an organization that promotes artistic innovation.
The leases have elicited a mixed reaction from the community, with some residents concerned that nonprofits will not create the feeling of a “main street” that they were hoping to see on Western Ave.
“The idea of Western Avenue as a main street is a long-established, officially-accepted goal of the city of Boston,” said Allston resident Harry Mattison, citing the Boston Redevelopment Authority’s 2005 document “North Allston: Strategic Framework for Planning.”
Mattison said that he did not object to Earthwatch and Silk Road per se, but wants to see a mixture of different kinds of businesses along Western Ave.
“Are there going to be another five businesses more similar to Mahoney’s Garden Center [another business that leases from Harvard] or another five businesses similar to Earthwatch?” Mattison asked.
Lapp defended leasing property to nonprofits, saying that the employees would provide commerce for the already existing businesses.
“It’s bringing a lot more people into the community—a lot more people to go down Western Ave. to buy a piece of pizza, go to the dry cleaners, or to the car wash—so we’re creating activity in the area,” she said.
The Boston Redevelopment Authority also said they had a positive reaction to the leases.
“We are, of course, supportive of adding more ‘main street’ businesses to Western Avenue and will continue to assist in attracting those kinds of tenants, but for now we are supportive and happy to welcome these two organizations to Boston,” wrote BRA spokeswoman Jessica Shumaker in an e-mailed statement.

Signs emblazoned with slogans such as "Adoption is an empowering option for women" and "Is this the face of the enemy?"—the latter accompanied by the image of a grinning infant—filled the room where Feminists for Life President Serrin M. Foster argued that opposing abortion is in the best interest of both women and babies.
"We want people to think about the issue in a different way," said Helen M. Keefe ’11, the vice president of speakers for Harvard Right to Life, which organized the event. "The criticism from the other side is that we don’t care about women and what they go through, but tonight’s message is that you can be a feminist and you can be pro-life at the same time."
Foster, whose organization advocates for the rights of pregnant women and their babies, said that it is important to look at the reasons why women choose to have abortions.
"Abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women," Foster said, adding that whether women fear being fired, expelled from school, or abandoned by their partners, their common concern is facing pregnancy alone.
"We should be helping women so their unborn little ones are not willed away from them," she said.
Foster added that women who decide they are not ready to be mothers can make that choice without having an abortion by instead opting for adoption or child support as alternatives to abortion.
But she noted that most college campuses, including Harvard, offer little support for student parents. She said that only five women with children have graduated from Harvard College—the rest either dropped out or had abortions. Furthermore, students are not allowed to live in campus housing if they have children.
"If you want to find out about parenting, there’s a lack of resources at Harvard—not just for students, but for graduate students who are married and even professors," Foster said. "No woman should be forced to choose between her education or career and her children."
Foster added that many women are coerced into having abortions by employers’ threats that they will lose their jobs. For this and other reasons, she said, abortion should not be something women have to consider at all.
"We want to think about how to make abortion unthinkable," she said. "That’s bigger than illegal—it’s about how a woman can demand more of those around her and not accept crap from people."
While Foster’s talk focused on how to offer more alternatives to abortion and greater support for mothers who are reluctant to be parents—whether due to poverty, career and education goals, or having conceived through sexual assault—she did not address the desires of women who simply do not want to have children.
"If a woman decides her career is more important to her and she wants to get an abortion, she has the right to power over her own body," said Abby P. Sun ’13, co-president of the Radcliffe Union of Students. "Any restrictions that try to involve the authority of someone else—I don’t think that’s something I would ever support as a feminist."

Physics Professor Melissa Franklin will replace fellow Professor Christopher W. Stubbs as the chair of the Harvard Physics Department next year, marking the first time in history that the position will be held by a woman.
Franklin will take over the rotating position for a three-year term after returning from Switzerland, where she is currently on sabbatical to analyze data from proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest particle accelerator.
Franklin, who was the first woman to receive tenure in the physics department, is widely known for discovering the existence of an elementary particle known as the top quark.
In a phone call from Geneva, Franklin said that she was excited to take on a number of different projects as chair, including improving undergraduate advising and restructuring the introductory physics curriculum.
She said that the current series of early physics classes—Physics 15a, 15b, and 15c—will likely be “replaced or modified” by the 2012 academic year.
Franklin also said that she hopes to continue Stubbs’s efforts to create a strong physics community—which included the creation of an undergraduate physics lounge in Jefferson Laboratory—while also working to attract a more diverse slate of students.
“It would be nice to have more women and more people of color in the department,” she said, adding that she also hopes to attract students who “are interested in physics but want to do other things” in their careers.
Stubbs said that his successor is widely known for her commitment to her students and her many accomplishments as a scientist.
“She’s one of the department’s most dedicated teachers,” Stubbs said. “I look forward to the work she puts forth.”
Vijay Jain ’11, one of the co-presidents of the Society of Physics Students, said that his experience as Franklin’s advisee made him confident that she will provide enthusiastic leadership for the department.
Jain, an inactive Crimson editor, recalled how Franklin took the time to Skype with him about his course selections earlier in the semester, even though she was busy with her Large Hadron Collider research.
“I think most of the undergraduates that do know Professor Franklin—especially her advisees—are really excited to see her as the new chair,” Jain said.

Shell Oil Company President Marvin E. Odum spoke about the future of his company and the energy industry to a packed audience in Science Center D yesterday.
The increasing global demand for energy, the volatility of energy price, and the stress of environmental problems pose a significant threat to traditional energy practices such as oil production, Odum said.
But according to Odum, there is no reason why the traditional energy industries should not focus on changing the present systems of energy supply.
Odum highlighted several possible roles that the oil and gas sectors might play in reshaping the energy industry—improving affordability, increasing efficiency, and developing low-emissions energy forms.
"I don’t obviously speak for the whole oil and gas industry, but I think the sector has two, or three actually, important roles to play," Odum said.
According to Odum, one of Shell’s goals is to make energy safer and more affordable. Another is to increase the efficiency of the company’s operations, though Odum noted that as an individual company such improvements in efficiency do not make much difference in the whole global system. A third major role for his company, Odum said, was developing low-carbon energy, such as natural gas and sustainable bio-fuels.
In 1997, alongside several other countries’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions, Shell set a target for reducing their own CO2 emissions by five percent from their 1990 levels by 2010. As of 2009, Shell Oil has reduced its total emissions by 35 percent, according to Odum.
While Shell is still called an oil company, Odum said that in 2012 more than 50 percent of the company’s product will be natural gas.
James I. Clem, managing director of the Harvard Center for the Environment, said that the Center invited Odum as part of a lecture series on the future of energy aimed at providing different perspectives from representatives from throughout the energy industry.
Clem said that "at least in the near term," oil will remain a major source of energy.
Michael J. Graham ’10 said he attended the event because he was looking into a career in the energy sector.
"This is, you know, a very important person, obviously one of the higher-ups in Shell Oil," Graham said. "I was just interested in what he has to say."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt may be taking over the property in the center of Harvard Square that has stood vacant for more than two years since the closing of Alpha Omega Jewelers.
Daniel E. Fraine, senior vice president for facilities of Cambridge Savings Bank, which owns the space, said that several companies have expressed interest in leasing the property, though no deal has been signed yet.
Fraine confirmed that Pinkberry is interested in the property but would not name the other companies who are competing for the space.
“We’re not close to signing anybody yet,” Fraine said. “It’s obviously hard work to try to get someone in there, and we have been [trying] for a year or so.”
“There’s been a lot interest in the space, and [we’re] just trying to get the right fit,” he added.
Pinkberry has stores in six states and four foreign countries, with two dozen more locations slated to open soon. Currently, the California-based chain has no stores in New England, but it plans to open three in Connecticut and another in Boston, according to its website.
“Oh my god, that is the best,” Kathy Y. Han ’10 said about Pinkberry’s yogurt, which she tasted in Los Angeles. “That will be awesome. It will totally kill Berryline,” she added, referring to the possible opening of a Pinkberry in Harvard Square.
Paige M. Livingston ’12 agreed that Harvard Square frozen yogurt shop Berryline’s product “just seems like an imitation” when compared to the Pinkberry frozen yogurt. “It doesn’t measure up,” she said.
Kevin M. Neylan ’12 said he preferred Berryline, calling Pinkberry “really overpriced and not very tasty.”
“Berryline is just so much better, in taste and general friendliness,” agreed Natalie S. Feldman ’12. “[Pinkberry is] a chain that started 3,000 miles away. Pinkberry’s not going to chase anybody away from Berryline—only if it’s open later.”
Daniel W. Kaeding, a shift supervisor at the Jamaica Plain branch of J.P. Licks, a Boston-based ice cream chain, said he doubts that J.P. Licks’ Harvard Square outpost “will be too badly damaged” if a Pinkberry store opens down the street.
“We have a greater diversity of products than Pinkberry does,” Kaeding said. “We have very uncommon flavors you’re not going to find anywhere else, like cucumber.”
Pinkberry and Berryline did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.

When she goes on walks with her daughter, Cambridge resident Katy Downey carries along a camera to snap shots of empty storefronts. When she spots shuttered retailers while driving, she pulls over to take photographs.
And when she gets home, she writes about her observations on her blog, “Empty Mass Ave.”
Since February, Downey has been chronicling the closings of businesses along Mass. Ave. in brief, nostalgia-laden posts.
“Seeing those white curtains of death is always a little jarring,” Downey wrote about the closing of clothing store The Attic.
Downey’s website isn’t all doom and gloom, however—she also highlights stores that have managed to stay open, such as the Hollywood Express video store that has survived competition from Netflix.
Downey said she hopes her blog will draw attention to the number of vacant properties in Cambridge and spur others to take action.
“I hope to get more feedback from people and to start a dialogue on the different ways these spaces can be used, if not for traditional retail,” she told The Crimson. “The more people who are talking and questioning and being creative, the more options we’ll have as a community.”
Her own suggestions for uses of empty space in her town—she has lived in Central Square for the past 13 years—include an indoor farmer’s market and a dinner movie theater.
Downey’s blog has at most 30 to 40 readers per day, which she said is “kind of a surprising amount for me, with no real publicity” other than her Twitter account, which has 4,000 followers.
With a few exceptions, she said that store closings do not “seem to be a huge problem in [Harvard] Square.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, agreed with Downey. Unlike other parts of Cambridge, “we’re in pretty good shape here,” Jillson said. “We’re really pleased.”
Jillson said that many of the businesses whose closings are documented on Downey’s blog already have been or will soon be replaced.
“Sometimes it can be incredibly misleading,” Jillson said of “Empty Mass Ave” and similar blogs. “Look at the photo right at the top of her page of the former Bowl and Board. If one looks at that, one says, ‘Oh my god, Harvard Square? What’s going on? It’s urban blight.’”
In reality, Jillson said, the Bowl and Board building is set to be torn down so a new building can be constructed. “Clearly, there is a plan,” Jillson said.

Italian pop star and cultural icon Lorenzo "Jovanotti" Cherubini spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School last night about his experiences as a musician and a proponent of human rights.
Jovanotti, who is a member of Amnesty International, emphasized the role of music in making positive change on both a global and individual scale.
"I always thought that the power of music, especially the power of pop music, [is that] it is music that is talking maybe just about kisses and about dancing and about having an ice cream together with your girlfriend in a bar," he said. "[But] that music is perhaps the most powerful because it promotes a sense of freedom that connects to the freedom of expressing yourself as a human being."
Technical difficulties with the sound system during Jovanotti’s talk prompted many smiles from the audience when the musician had trouble maneuvering the microphone.
"I am a singer and a musician—I prefer [to] have a drumbeat when I speak," he said to eruptions of laughter.
When an audience member asked Jovanotti what cause he fought for most adamantly, he was quick to answer that his main focus was combating poverty.
"I think that cause would be poverty. Extreme poverty," he said. "Extreme poverty is that condition where you cannot desire a better life—it’s a poverty where you don’t even know that there is a better life."
"Why [do] I say that? Because extreme poverty can be solved," Jovanotti added.
Jovanotti began his career as a rapper, but quickly undertook a musical transition into a style that focused much more on world music and ethnic rhythms. Jovanotti said that this shift in musical style was accompanied by a realization that his music could also be applied to social and political activism.
"This is fantastic, I thought, this is great—I can do this with my job?" Jovanotti said.
"Music has this power, more than the Pope, you know?" he added.
Last night’s talk was a break from the normal schedule for Jovanotti, who spent the last few days on the East Coast touring for a series of shows and concerts. The talk was part of a larger initiative produced in collaboration with the Carr Center’s Measurement and Human Rights Program.
Before returning to his concert tour, Jovanotti said he wanted to impress upon his audience that great social change is more needed than ever.
"Today we are in a critical moment," he said.

Harvard Mathematics Professor Shing-Tung Yau, one of this year’s two winners of the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, announced on Monday that he intends use his portion of the award to create a fund at China’s Tsinghua University to support the study of mathematics, especially among low income students.
According to the Wolf Foundation’s website, the non-profit organization annually awards $100,000 grants to scientists and artists “for achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among peoples.” Grants are  awarded in six categories: agriculture, chemistry, medicine, physics, arts, and mathematics.
Although Yau—who won the Fields Medal in 1982 and currently serves as the chair of the Harvard Mathematics Department—never attended Tsinghua, he said he decided to donate his prize money to this top Chinese university because it has produced extraordinary mathematics talent in the past.
Yau said in an e-mailed statement that two of the “greatest Chinese mathematicians” studied and taught at Tsinghua University, including Shiing-Shen Chern, who served as Yau’s mentor while at the University of California, Berkeley.
Yau added that he hopes that the fund, which will bear his name, will help the university’s students “achieve high scholarship” so “that they may [also] be awarded the Wolf Prize in the future.”
Yau, who received the award for his contributions to the creation of the field of geometric analysis, is credited with solving several significant conjectures in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.
According to the Wolf Foundation’s  website, Yau will officially receive his award from Israeli President Shimon Peres and Israeli Education Minister and Wolf Foundation Council Chairman Gideon Sa’ar at a ceremony in Jerusalem this May.
Stony Brook University Professor Dennis P. Sullivan, who shares this year’s prize for mathematics with Yau, will also be recognized during the upcoming ceremony for his work in algebraic topology and conformal dynamics.

Under the spotlights of the Harvard Business School’s Burden Auditorium, the eight finalist teams of the 14th annual Business Plan Contest showed off their aptitude for entrepreneurship.
The eight teams—competing in either the Business Venture track of the competition or the Social Venture track—pitched their business models to an audience of peers, faculty, and family.
The contest is representative of the Business’s School focus on entrepreneurship, wrote Business School spokesman James E. Aisner ’68 in an e-mail.
"A lot of students in the past thought long and hard about whether they should go to Wall Street or consulting—where the dollars, frankly, are attractive—versus take the risk of starting their own venture," Business School Lecturer Michael J. Roberts ’79 said. "Today the fact that a lot of those jobs aren’t there, the opportunity cost of choosing this route is lower...it’s a lot more appealing for students to seize control of their own destiny."
The winning team in the Social Venture Track—Urban Water Planners—plans to lease slow sand filters to water vendors in Dar es Salaam to improve the quality of the city’s drinking water.
For the team members of Urban Water Partners, two of whom live in Utah, one of the major difficulties in formulating their plan was coordinating their efforts across the country.
Oscomp Systems, which plans to commercialize a natural gas compressor that they claim will revolutionize the energy market, won in the competition’s Business Venture Track.
"I feel completely exhilarated. Everything is finally coming together," said team member and second year HBS student Shantanu Agarwal.
This year, the competition also included an Alumni Venture Contest in which seven Harvard Clubs from around the world selected business plans submitted by regional alumni. The winning alumni plan, Sundaram Medical Devices, will market inexpensive and more technologically advanced hospital beds to Indian medical facilities.
The competition generates a significant amount of excitement on campus every year, according to both Roberts and Agarwal.
"Entrepreneurship is the best form of business, I think all the students want to own our own business," Agarwal said. "The people who are actually doing entrepreneurship are considered the cowboys, because they’re jumping off the cliff instead of taking a more secure job."
The Business School divides its first-years into ten groups called sections, and the Business Plan Contest gave students a chance to show off their section pride. When Business Venture track contestants Hayley Barna and Katia Ververis took the stage, their section mates roared and waved hot pink tissue paper, in reference to the pink tissue paper used in their product.

Former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei expressed hope for a world free from nuclear weapons, speaking before a full house at the Institute of Politics yesterday evening.
ElBaradei, who is the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, said that a new global security system must be founded on “peace rather than war,” calling the latter “a curse which indicates the failure of human beings.”
ElBaradei recounted his time at the IAEA, during which he oversaw some of the most pressing and intractable issues in nuclear weapons control in Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and persistently advocated a policy of diplomacy instead of war.
In discussing Iran’s nuclear developments, ElBaradei said he remains hopeful that the country will reach a deal with Western countries through bilateral negotiations, and commended President Obama for seeking to “engage Iran without preconditions and with respect.” He cautioned against sanctions, which he said served more as “acts of desperation.”
ElBaradei also addressed positive new developments in arms control, particularly Obama’s recent weapons control agreement with Russia. But he expressed worries regarding the unsustainable status quo and the “deadly combination of extremism” in the Middle East.
“The Arab world is disintegrating,” he said.
ElBaradei also called on his home country of Egypt to “move beyond an authoritarian system to a democracy, empowering people and restoring basic freedoms.”
Rumors of his possible candidacy for the Egyptian presidency loomed over last night’s event.
When asked whether he saw himself as the next president of Egypt, ElBaradei did not rule out running for office, saying that the election was less of a “priority” than serving as an “agent of change.”
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison ’62, who moderated the event, called ElBaradei “one the genuinely great leaders of his generation,” encouraging students in the audience to learn from [ElBaradei’s] courage.
Several students in attendance praised ElBaradei’s frankness.
“What we need today is renewed dialogue between the Western and Arab worlds, particularly in the realm of nuclear weapons,” said graduate student Carlos A. Blanco.
“As an Arab-American, I was particularly excited to hear what Mr. ElBaradei had to say,” said Rimal A. Kacem ’10, co-president of the Harvard Society of Arab Students. “I hope there are more events in the University on intercultural dialogue.”

The Chabad House at Harvard has placed a $6 million bid to purchase the building at 45 Dunster Street from the Fly Club—which currently leases the space to the Bee Club—according to exchanges on final club e-mail lists obtained by The Crimson.
The offer threatens the Bee Club's future use of the house, and this week, Bee members have solicited support and donations from many final club members via e-mail.
But the $6 million bid is more than double the market value of the building and land, which the City of Cambridge assessed at $2.7 million, according to property records.
Harvard Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish center, currently owns a building on Banks St. near Dunster and Mather Houses. The Chabad purchased the building for $1.5 million in 2003.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many Ivy League teams,  the end is near (or already here). This weekend wraps up the regular  season for baseball, softball, and men’s lacrosse, while women’s  lacrosse and golf crowned their league champions last weekend.
Penn won its first-ever Ancient  Eight title in women’s golf to go with its fourth-straight conference  crown in women’s lacrosse, and Columbia outplayed the field at Baltusrol  to take home its third-consecutive men’s golf title.
That wacky New England weather  means that there are still plenty of games to be played on the diamonds  before this weekend’s home-and-home series between travel partners,  but the picture in men’s lacrosse is even murkier, with five teams  competing for three open spots in the tournament.
Ready for the madness? Let’s  take a look around the Ivies.
MEN’S LACROSSE
Another weekend, another fallen  titan. Not to be outdone by its female counterpart, the Harvard men’s  lacrosse team took out league-leader Princeton—then ranked sixth in  the nation—by an 11-8 count on Saturday, its first win against the  Tigers since 1990. That upset has thrown the Crimson back into the heat  of the playoff race and complicated the picture even further.
Penn, which has already wrapped  up its Ivy season, is eliminated from tournament contention. Despite  the loss, Princeton is in the tournament and has clinched at least  a share of the title. No one else is safe. To get in, all No. 19 Harvard  has to do is win—no easy task on the road at No. 17 Yale.
WOMEN’S LACROSSE
After running the Ivy table,  Penn easily claimed the top seed in the tournament. It’s joined in  the dance by 5-2 Dartmouth and 4-3 Cornell and Princeton. That leaves  Harvard, at 3-4, on the outside looking in.
The Crimson did its part by  beating Columbia on the road on Saturday, but the Tigers upset the Big  Green in overtime, snatching the last spot from Harvard’s grasp. Though  the Crimson did beat two of the teams that made the field in Princeton  and Cornell, that one-goal loss to Brown a month ago proved too much  to overcome.
Penn hosts the tournament and  will play the fourth-seeded Tigers on Friday night. The Big Green and  Big Red tangle on Friday afternoon, and the winners will play for the  tournament championship and automatic trip to the NCAA tournament on  Sunday.
BASEBALL
The Gehrig Division managed  to actually play a full schedule this weekend, and with four games to  go, Columbia holds a two-game lead over Penn. But that lead is not safe,  as the squads will clash in a crucial home-and-home series this weekend  to determine who goes to the Ivy League Championship Series.
Dartmouth and Brown split their  Saturday twinbill, and the Big Green won the first game today to take  a one-game lead in the division standings. Game two was rained out and  will be played tomorrow, as will Harvard and Yale’s second doubleheader.  The Crimson sits two and a half games back of Dartmouth heading into  this weekend’s home-and-home series between the two squads.
SOFTBALL
The defending Ancient Eight  champs have all but locked up their place in the Ivy League Championship  Series, as Cornell claimed at least a share of the South Division title  with a series sweep of Columbia this weekend. The Big Red needs to win  only one game against Princeton this weekend (or have Penn lose once)  to take the crown outright—which shouldn’t be a problem, as the  Tigers have fallen from grace and now sit at 5-11 in Ivies.
Meanwhile, up in the North  Division, Harvard took care of business today, completing a four-game  sweep of Yale to move two games ahead of the Big Green in the division  race. Dartmouth and Brown, who split Saturday’s games, will meet again  tomorrow in a makeup twinbill.
The Crimson’s trip to the  ILCS is not yet secure, though, and this weekend’s showdown with the  Big Green will once again determine the division winner.
Sophomore Rachel Brown, the  reigning Ivy League Pitcher of the Week, picked up both wins today with  10.1 innings of scoreless work, striking out 19 in the process.

According to those who know him best, Kevin Vaughan is not a guy who seeks the spotlight.
But after the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s win over Princeton, the spotlight is definitely finding him.
Last Saturday at Harvard Stadium, the sophomore attack notched three tallies and scooped four ground balls as the Crimson (6-5, 2-3 Ivy) defeated then-No. 6 Tigers (9-3, 4-1), 11-8.
“The game was huge,” sophomore attack Jeff Cohen said. “It was a historic win for the program—we hadn’t done it in 20 years.”
Vaughan likewise expressed how important the victory was for the team and lacrosse alumni alike.
“There were a lot of alumni there who hadn’t beaten [Princeton],” Vaughan explained. “It was nice to get the win for them and for the seniors on Senior Day.”
But the win did not come easily.
“It was a dog fight for most of the game,” coach John Tillman said. “It was very back and forth…[Kevin] scored some important goals for us.”
In the fourth quarter, Vaughan found the back of the net twice for his second and third goals to give Harvard a four-point lead—its biggest of the game—with 3:44 left to play.
Yet, when asked how he felt about being such a large part of the win, Vaughan was quick to downplay his contribution.
“The coach asked me to do certain things,” Vaughan said. “I was just doing my job; [it was] nothing exceptional.”
According to Tillman, though, Vaughan’s success with his “job” is exactly what makes him exceptional.
“The thing that makes him very helpful for us is that he’s very versatile,” Tillman said. “By plugging him into different spots, we can have other players play to their specific strengths…Kevin has no problem taking on different roles depending on what the team needs.”
Part of this adaptability, Tillman further explained, is the result of Vaughan’s unique blend of skills.
“An attack is sometimes...a pure scorer. Other times, [he] is maybe somebody who gets a lot of assists, feeding the ball and setting up the team. Other times, [he] is more of a leader,” he said. “Kevin is a little bit of all of those things.”
Because of this, Tillman has sometimes been plugging Vaughan into the midfield position.
“Kevin has moved into a new role for our team,” Cohen explained. “He’s been playing a lot of mid, and he’s done a great job [there] in addition to scoring on the attack.”
In this role, Vaughan has scooped up at least one ground ball in nine of eleven games so far this season.
“It’s a unique skill,” Tillman said. “It’s less about talent and more about effort. Kevin does a terrific job in those situations…because he’s very aggressive and relentless, and he has a lot of energy, courage, and toughness. If he doesn’t get the ball, he can keep it loose so someone else can pick it up.”
The numerous praises for Vaughan’s talents do not end here. When asked about his commitment to the team, Cohen and Tillman’s responses were once again laudatory.
“He’s one of the hardest workers on the team,” Cohen said. “He has a great work ethic that rubs off on a lot of guys, including myself…Guys see that and they want to work hard.”
Tillman expressed a similar opinion about Vaughan’s intangibles.
“If you think of an ideal teammate, I think he would be it,” Tillman said. “He’s a guy that works hard every day and challenges his team to be better…If things aren’t going well, he’s always about picking the team up instead of being negative and pointing fingers.”
“I couldn’t say this about everyone on the team,” he added.
But Tillman strove to emphasize that Vaughan’s success will not be limited to the lacrosse field.
“He’s the type of guy that succeeds at a place like Harvard,” Tillman concluded. “I think that he’s a guy who didn’t come here just to play lacrosse. He came to get a great education, to grow, to play lacrosse, and to have a great experience. Harvard should be really proud to have him as an ambassador after he graduates. He’s a better person than he is a lacrosse player.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown pitched 10.1 innings over two games yesterday to help the Harvard softball team complete a four-game sweep of archrival Yale at Dewitt Family Field in New Haven, Conn.
Brown pitched four and one-third innings of one-hit ball in the first game and the Crimson (22-20, 13-3 Ivy) withheld a late rally to win it, 6-4. Brown followed that effort with a six-inning, two-hit gem in the second game of the doubleheader to help Harvard blank the Bulldogs (9-26, 4-12), 5-0.
The wins extends the Crimson’s lead in the North Division to two games. Harvard’s last four league games of the season will be against second-place Dartmouth, a rematch of last year’s series that determined the North Division. Dartmouth takes on Brown today before facing the Crimson this weekend.
“These were definitely the most important games of the season so far,” Brown said. “It was really important for us to win both to stay ahead of Dartmouth.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 0
Both teams got off to slow starts before senior Jennifer Francis led off the top of the third with a double. Two batters later, junior Ellen Macadam homered to left field to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead.
That lead would have been more than enough for Brown, who allowed just one hit through the first five innings and finished with 11 strikeouts, brining her season total to 206—the second consecutive year she has finished with over 200 strikeouts.
Harvard provided insurance in the sixth inning, beginning with sophomore Whitney Shaw’s one-out single. After freshman Jess Ferri fouled out, senior Jessica Pledger walked and sophomore Jane Alexander hit an RBI single. Francis followed with a two-run double but was called out trying to stretch at third.
Pitcher and co-captain Margaux Black gave up two hits but managed to pitch a scoreless seventh inning to give Harvard its third four-game winning streak of the season.
“This was a very important and exciting game for us,” Black said. “Sweeping Yale puts us in a great spot heading into the final weekend against Dartmouth. We had dominant pitching, great defense, and timely hitting. We played with heart.”
HARVARD 6, YALE 4
The Crimson used a six-run third inning to provide all the offense it needed, while sophomore pitcher Mari Zumbro fended off a late Bulldogs rally to clinch the season series victory for Harvard. The win also pushed the Crimson above .500 for the first time since it began the season 1-0.
The two squads combined for only one hit through the first two innings, but Harvard would take advantage of some control issues by Yale’s Holly Gutterud to knock in six runs in the top of the third frame.
After Macadam led off with a walk, co-captain Melissa Schellberg, a Crimson sports editor, and Shaw hit back-to-back RBI doubles to give Harvard a 2-0 lead. Pledger followed with a walk, and Alexander singled to center to load the bases. Francis stepped up to the plate and hit a grand slam to extend the lead to 6-0.
The inning was crucial for the Crimson, as it would only manage one hit over the final four innings.
Yale’s Gutterud pitched a complete game but allowed four of her six hits and two of her four walks in the decisive third inning.
Brown pitched four innings and got the last out of the ninth. She allowed only one hit to earn her 13th win of the season.
The Bulldogs threatened in the final frame when batter Mariclaire Rebman led off with a strikeout but was able to reach first on a wild pitch by Zumbro. After a single and a flyout that put runners on second and third, another single and a groundout brought in two runs for Yale. Two more wild pitches and a throwing error brought in two more Bulldog runs, forcing Brown to come back in to end the Bulldogs’ threat and preserve the win for the Harvard.
“We’re playing our best softball, and it couldn’t come at a better time,” Brown said. “Hopefully, we’ll continue it into next weekend and take the North Divison.”

Last spring, then-sophomore Collier Winters was faced with a daunting challenge—step into the shoes of Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09, who had just signed an NFL contract, and take the helm of the offense of the two-time defending Ivy League champion football team.
Piece of cake, right? But before Winters could even think about beating Holy Cross in the season opener, he had to beat out a few teammates for the starting role.
Winters won the job in preseason, edging out classmate Matt Simpson for the top spot on the depth chart. He went on to lead the Crimson to a 7-3 record, including a second-place finish in the Ancient Eight.
Though he had a lot of things going for him—including an experienced corps of receivers as targets, the Ivy League’s leading rusher in the backfield, and a talented offensive line to protect him—Winters made the most of his opportunities. His 57.4 pass-completion percentage, 15 touchdown passes, and three touchdown runs were good enough for second-team All-Ivy honors, and his ability to orchestrate a pair of late scoring drives in a comeback win in The Game proved that he could perform in the clutch.
So looking to 2010, with most of the receiver and tailback corps intact, shouldn’t Winters be a shoo-in to reprise his role as Harvard’s primary signal caller?
Well, not so fast, because junior Andrew Hatch is back on the team after a four-year absence that took him from Chile to LSU and finally back to Cambridge last fall.
Though Hatch re-enrolled at Harvard last spring, NCAA regulations made the signal caller ineligible to play for the Crimson in 2009 (and, in fact, he hasn’t yet been officially cleared for 2010—though Harvard coach Tim Murphy is optimistic that he will be).
Hatch is now back taking snaps at Harvard Stadium, just two years removed from earning the starting role out of preseason for LSU—the then-defending national champions—in 2008.
Suddenly, Winters’s job doesn’t seem quite so safe anymore.
Each of the two quarterbacks brings different strengths to the table, but each still has things to prove. Winters will have to rely more on his pass game this season, as a young and inexperienced offensive line may not allow for as much success on the ground as the Crimson enjoyed last year. Hatch, meanwhile, has to relearn the Harvard system and adjust to Murphy’s pro-style offense.
But for the Crimson, a little competition may be just what is needed to push the offense to the next level.
“We need one of those guys to really jump out and improve to be a championship-caliber offense,” Murphy said after Saturday’s spring game. “You take a quarterback position that has no competition, and you’re never going to reach your full potential if you’re not competing.”
Though the competition under center will be fierce, whoever wins the starting job will still have a daunting task ahead of him.
The unsung heroes of the 2009 season were the offensive linemen—seniors James Williams, Alex Spisak, John Paris, and Ben Sessions, along with junior Brent Osborne—making it possible for Harvard’s offense to thrive last season with a new face at quarterback.
The linemen gave Winters time in the pocket and created gaping holes for junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales to run through. Though Gordon and Scales have a great deal of athleticism and will likely still be near the top of the Ancient Eight in rushing this season, it will be hard for the Crimson to replicate last season’s outstanding rushing effort, in which it ran for an average of 178.7 yards per game, 20 more than second-ranking Columbia.
In short, Harvard’s got its work cut out for it. Although it has the benefit of returning a strong group of rising seniors on offense, including Gordon and fellow All-Ivy honorees Chris Lorditch, Brent Osborne, and Nicolai Schwarzkopf, and is bringing back plenty of starters on defense, the other top Ivy squads are coming back as strong as ever.
Like the Crimson, Brown and Penn have graduated several key players. The Bears’ fearsome wide receiver duo of Bobby Sewall and Buddy Farnham is gone, as is the Quakers’ formidable linebacker, Jake Lewko.
All three signed NFL contracts on Monday (as did James Williams, who inked a deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers).
But both Brown and Penn are bringing back their quarterbacks. Kyle Newhall-Caballero separated himself from the pack of Ivy signal-callers last season, earning first-team All-Ivy honors for the Bears, and if Quaker Keiffer Garton can stay healthy, he has the potential to be one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the league.
Princeton and Cornell have new coaches at the helm as they look to climb the Ivy ladder. Yale coach Tom Williams will be hell-bent on proving that he belongs in New Haven after a risky gamble cost the Bulldogs The Game last season. Dartmouth’s young team—including Nick Schweiger, a first-team All-Ivy running back—will benefit from an added year of experience, and Columbia is bringing back a trio of All-Ivy athletes.
As of now, it’s anybody’s title.
Football fans will have to wait until September to see how it all shakes out. But for Winters, Hatch, and the rest of the Harvard football team, the battle has already begun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone knows Harvard students are pros at hitting the books, but few are aware that the students can be just as good at hitting each other.
Tonight, the Harvard Boxing Club will put its talent on display at its second annual Exhibition Night. The event is free to the public and will take place from 7:30 p.m.–9:30 p.m. at the Quad Recreational Center.
Last year’s exhibition that drew a crowd of about 150 spectators was the first of its kind for more than 30 years on Harvard’s campus. Once an intramural sport, boxing was relegated to club status after unruly crowds caused serious concerns at end-of- year House tournaments.
In tonight’s event, Boxing Club members will take each other on in seven different match-ups, some male and some female, consisting of three, two-minute rounds. The club’s coach, Doug Yoffe, will take his place in the ring as referee.
The American Association of Neurological Surgeons may warn that up to 90% of boxers sustain some sort of head injury or brain damage, but don’t worry. Harvard boxers will be taking all of the necessary safety precautions to protect their Ivy League domes.
And besides, they probably have a couple brain cells to spare.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For fans of Harvard softball, one thing has become a near-guarantee over the last two years: put sophomore Rachel Brown on the mound, and the Crimson will probably come away with the win.
After a phenomenal freshman season in which the hurler took home Ivy Rookie of the Year honors, Brown’s compiling some serious credentials for another piece of hardware—Ancient Eight Pitcher of the Year.
Over her last 12 appearances, Brown has given up just one earned run—good for a 0.11 ERA in the 63.1-inning stretch.
She’s gone 7-1 in that stretch, which dates back to an Apr. 6 win at Holy Cross. The one loss? A 1-0 decision against the Brown Bears nearly two weeks ago.
The sophomore now has a miniscule 1.21 ERA to go along with her 14-5 record and 206 strikeouts—just five shy of her own single-season program record.
So how does Brown stack up to the all-time Harvard greats?
If the season ended today, the pitcher would own the single-season record for opponent batting average (.171) and strikeouts per seven innings pitched (10.40). She’d also rank second in single-season ERA and strikeouts.
For her career, Brown’s already tops on the all-time list in strikeouts per seven innings pitched (10.10), and she is second in ERA (1.35), fourth in strikeouts (417), and tied for sixth in wins (30)—and she’s still got two years to go.
Brown is unquestionably the Crimson’s ace, and she’s arguably on her way to being the greatest pitcher in Harvard history.
Her primary competition for Ivy Pitcher of the Year is Cornell’s Elizabeth Dalrymple, who took home the prize last year. But as of now, Brown’s leading Dalrymple in ERA, strikeouts, shutouts, and opponent batting average—and she’s won Pitcher of the Week honors three times to Dalrymple’s one.
But there’s one thing Dalrymple already has that Brown is missing—a 2010 division title. Though the Big Red has clinched a share of the South Division with four games to go, the Crimson must earn its trip to the Ivy League Championship Series this weekend in a home-and-home series with Dartmouth.

What's a good, cheap first date?
A first date should be a couple of things—first, it should be low stress. That means don't take your date out for dinner with your parents and extended family; don't (overtly) plan 7 hours of continuous activity in the hopes that the chemistry won't fizzle somewhere between movie, dinner, drinks, dancing and catching a comedy show; and don't take your date somewhere very expensive (unless you wish to be a sugar daddy/mommy), etc.
Second, the first date should be personal. Know your audience. That means don't take a vegan to a steakhouse. If your date has mentioned that he/she loves croissants, show how thoughtful you are by taking him/her to a great bakery. Pick somewhere that's conducive to conversation. Be polite. Bathe beforehand. Smile.
With that being said, my favorite first date venue is a low key coffee shop or cafe. Maybe a cool, cheap ethnic restaurant if I'm feeling more peckish. My favorite options in Harvard Square include Algiers—which has a beautiful circular second floor, cozy nooks, tables for two, and mint tea. They do delicious things with eggplant there. Crema Cafe is also a perennial favorite for just about any event in life. Its new turkey sandwich (with jicama slaw, avocado, and bacon) blew me out of the water—an absolute must-try. This is such a warm, casual space with great drinks and food—really all you could ever ask for.
If you're feeling more adventurous, a fun option could be hitting up Rialto, in the Charles Hotel, for their $1 oyster night on Mondays. In the mood for romancing over weekday lunch? Kebab Factory, a ten minute walk up the street from Annenberg, has the best Indian lunch buffet in Cambridge. Across the street from Kebab Factory is The Biscuit, another adorable independent coffee shop that is more of an "I'm in the neighborhood" stop rather than a destination. Then there are the sweet cliches: tangy fro yo at Berryline, cupcakes at Sweet, a stiff brew of molten chocolate at Burdick's.
If you don't feel like convening over food, you could catch a show at Club Passim, walk by the Charles River, check out a festival, or explore some new part of town. Preferably Inman Square, because Inman Square is amazing.
My final point is that it really doesn't matter where you go. If it's meant to be, bad coffee certainly won't stand in your way.

Last night, an e-mail from a third year (3L) Harvard Law School student garnered a flurry of angry responses and concerns from Black Law Student Associations (BLSAs) across the nation.
The e-mail was sent after dinner in attempt to clarify the 3L’s point concerning intelligence. According to an article from the legal blog Above the Law, the e-mail said, “I absolutely do not rule out the possibility that African Americans are, on average, genetically predisposed to be less intelligent.”
Within 24 hours, the e-mail made its way to the Harvard BLSA e-mail list-serv via forwarding and subsequently to many other BLSAs around the country. The forwarded e-mail also included the original writer’s full name and future plans at a federal clerkship after graduation.
The student who forwarded the e-mail said, “I am saddened that a current HLS student holds such antagonistic and archaic views about our people and that the potential impact of her ignorance is only strengthened by her prestigious affiliations and credentials.”
 
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 29, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 28 FlyBy post "HLS Student Sends Racy E-Mail" referred to the Above the Law blog as a Harvard Law School-affiliated site. In fact, Above the Law is a legal blog with no affiliation with HLS.

Never been to Lamont? (There’s a café there?) Not really sure where the Greenhouse is located? Still have $130 left on your Board Plus before it expires on May 22? No worries, we’ve got your back (even though you just might live in a hole) on just how to spend your newfound wad of cash in this burning Board Plus series.
Board Plus Redemption Center: Rock Café in Rockefeller Hall, Harvard Divinity School.
 
Hours: Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.; Student café (not reviewed below) opens Monday - Thursday, 2:30 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.
Ambiance: This is where the Rock Café shines. With large windows, tasteful art, and a roomy interior with booths and sofa chairs, you may very well feel like you’ve walked into a classy cafe. Only the H1N1 table tents and the plethora of Purell dispensers give away that it’s a Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) operated venue.
Whether you came with a friend or by yourself to study (or with a Board Plus date!), the Rock Café offers a versatile environment for both conversation and serious work.  Power plugs are located at the booths and along the walls.
Food: Rock Café offers a standard selection of HUDS foods, including a grill, soups, wraps/sandwiches (pre-made and to-order), sushi, and boxed salads. Beverages include refrigerated juices, milk, Peet’s Coffee, etc. The variety isn’t too extensive, but definitely manageable.
The Final Word: The Rock Café may be a good walk from your dorm, past Northwest Labs and Vanserg. But if you’re willing to make the commute, you will get one of the nicest HUDS cafes we’ve seen in terms of ambiance with a completely workable array of food options.

When it comes to partying, Harvard is no match for its neighbors across the river. Four Boston College athletes were recently implicated in alcohol-related reckless driving that led to a Green Line collision this past weekend.
Among those involved in the accident are two defensemen and a goalie from BC’s 2010 national championship-winning men’s hockey team. Police say they discovered blood-smeared beer cans at the site of the accident and an unopened bottle of Rubinoff vodka inside the students’ Jeep. No casualties or critical injuries were reported.
According to the MBTA Transit police report, a Green Line trolley was heading toward a routine stop at roughly midnight on Sunday in Brighton when a black SUV with the BC students appeared in the train’s path. The operator of the trolley stated that he alerted the SUV, blaring the horn several times, but to no avail. The train’s emergency stop mechanism did not act fast enough to avoid colliding with the Jeep, thrusting the SUV back.
The report stated that several of the BC students emerged from the vehicle following the crash, seized “numerous items that appeared to have been alcoholic beverages,” and swiftly left the scene of the accident.
By the time police arrived, the Boston Fire Department and EMS personnel were extricating the remaining passengers from the vehicle.
The driver of the Jeep maintains that she was not intoxicated when the collision took place, citing an allergy to alcohol.
The Boston College Athletics office has yet to take disciplinary action against the students, given that no formal charges have been brought forth by police.
